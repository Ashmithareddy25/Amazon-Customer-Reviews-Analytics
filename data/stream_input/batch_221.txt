0790729628|1.0|This has got to be the ALL-TIME WORST DVD conversion EVER!<br />Blade Runner was a great movie. They could've released it with both versions, w/voice over, and this ...! But no option! You're stuck with this ..., and YOU get to do the voice over for everyone who sees this for the first time!<br />My wife, and several friends have never seen the original, and it took me 5 hours to get through this ... while I tried explaining why so-and-so did that! Or why is he staring off into space? Or what was that look for? Is \\"Skin Job\\" a new kind of plastic surgery?<br />DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY! RENT IT FIRST! You'll see what I mean!
B0000640VO|5.0|I was lucky enough to participate as a student in the Telluride Film Festival's City Lights Student Film Program.  The first night of the festival began with a staff and student showing (and was also the American opening) of Amelie.  The theatre was howling with laughter and pleasure.  The acclaimed Telluride Film festival was also first to debut films such as Life is Beautiful and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Draggon, and to me, those films are boring compared to the colorful and hilarious Amelie.  If you have not already seen this, go to the theatre or buy it.  It will be something that I will have in my favorite movie collection for many years to come.
B00000F169|1.0|I made the mistake of reading the book first, it was the most hilarious thing I've ever read! Everytime I read it I bust out laughing. I'd never seen the movie in the theaters, or on VHS, so I bought it when it came out on DVD.<BR>The DVD provides it in two versions; the original full-length, and the version edited for theaters. For some reason, it's not funny, not like the book, and this was disappointing. I got a feeling like I was watching a bunch of stoners trying to finish something they'd all given up on years ago.<BR>After a few minutes it just sorta drags on, and on, and on, ad infinitum.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Decadent! Pure and simple, that's the word I would use to describe this movie. Never mind that the actors all sang their own parts (impressive enough), the acting is superb! I've never once liked Ewan McGregor in anything (what the hell was Trainspotting, anyway?) he did, but WOW! It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, but I think it is a pre-requisite that you watch this movie as an open-minded person. After all, it is about bohemian principles! The only negative comments I've personally heard are from people who are so closed to the freedoms of expressions of artists that they would never be able to hold onto the meaning: The only thing you NEED to learn is just to love and be loved in return. What a fantastic ideology! This is a relatively clean, absolutely hilarious (the scene where McGregor and Kidman are first alone together is a riot!), childlike view of what could be perceived as a very dark and oppressive situation, and it brings it fantastically (and by that I mean \\"with fantasy\\") into your world by incorporating modern music into an age-old story. Very tongue-in-cheek, vibrant, colorful, magical. The cinematography, sets, language ... it is odd, don't get me wrong. But who the heck wants \\"normal\\" anyway?
B00005RYKU|2.0|This is the kind of movie I'd expect to see on HBO some night starring Elizabeth Berkley and Lance Henrikson, not coming to a theatre near me with Leelee Sobieski and Stellen Skaarsgard.  Okay, I'd trade Stellen for Lance everyday of the week and twice on Sunday, but you get the idea.<br />Ruby (Sobieski) is a fun-loving normal teen until her parents' untimely demise in a car accident.  Along with her brother, she is sent to live with the Glasses...Glass's...Glassesses.  Whatever.   You can probably guess if you've seen these kinds of movies that they appear normal at first but after a while Mrs. Glass (Diane Lane) starts to look like an obsessive flake and Mr. Glass (Skaarsgard) starts to look like a leering, horny, letch.  Of course, no one will believe Ruby when she tells them.  You probably could guess that.  The whole thing reaches its conclusion in a ludicrous car battle between Leelee and Stellan (in full Jason-you-can't-kill-him mode) and some guys that Stellan owes money to thrown in for fodder.<br />Let's do a post-mortem.  There's nothing really wrong with The Glass House (not in a Freddie Got Fingered way).  It's just kinda blah.  The only reason I feel an ounce of sympathy for Ruby is because she's played by Sobieski who could bring warmth to a Hillary Clinton biography.  Sorry, Hill.  Stellan is good, but not as good as in Insomnia.  And why put Diane Lane in this movie and give her so little to do.  Jennifer Rubin could have played the exact same role just as effectively (and probably a lot cheaper).<br />The place where this movie really excels and separates itself from the made-for-cable stuff you see on HBO is the cinematography.  The whole movie just looks amazing.  The Glass's house, while luxurious, is cold and forbidding (just like the Glasses).  It almost feels like they said \\"Hey, we have this house that looks really cool, come up with a movie for it.\\"  If you have HDTV with a 16:9 screen I could almost recommend this movie just to show it off.  Almost.<br />Try to catch it on cable instead.
6304711875|5.0|\\"My mom and dad are going to be so mad at me!\\"<br />I still laugh out loud hearing that line.  Wes Craven's Scream is a tribute to all the eighties horror, especially Halloween (itself a tribute to Psycho).  A young girl alone one night gets menacing phone calls from a man who is apparently watching her as he talks (When a Stranger Calls!).  The killer, wearing a white mask, attacks her (Halloween).  As he goes in for the kill she reaches up with a dying hand and pulls the mask from his face.  As she does we see a slight hint of recognition in her eyes.  Now THAT'S an opening.  Already they've established a solid whodunit wrapped around a slasher film.  It just gets better from there.<br />We meet Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell, cutest girl ever!) and her boyfriend, Billy (Skeet Ulrich).  After some witty banter between Sydney, Billy, friends Tatum and Stu, and local film-geek Randy, the same killer attacks Sydney.  And right now if you're a slasher fan you think you've got it figured out.  Sydney trusts one of the characters absolutely after her attack and you just know it's him!  That's when Craven and writer Kevin Williamson pull the rug out from under you.  It can't possibly be him because all signs point to him!  They've used your own expectations against you.<br />That's the brilliance of Scream.  Some critics will tell you that Scream owes its success to a sort of self-reference and ironic view of horror.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Scream owes itself to a solid story and mystery, good performances, and excellent direction just like every other genre of movie.  Check out the slasher films that followed with the same tone and lesser writing, acting, direction, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br />I watched this movie in a theatre on opening weekend in 1996.  There were maybe 12-15 people in the theatre.   The most recent movie I had seen in a theatre at that point was Halloween 6 and it was a similar crowd.  Like everyone else in the theatre that night I felt disappointed.  We had gone in expecting the fine cuisine of Michael Myers and had come out with the bitter leftovers of dying genre.  The audience I saw Scream with came out happy and talking about getting in line to see it again.  Quite a contrast!<br />Scream opened in something like 5th place at the box office that weekend.  By the next weekend it was third. ...That's the kind of thing that happens when you make a really good movie.  Put this one on your shelf along with Halloween and Psycho.  It belongs there.
B00005RHGK|3.0|So there's this horrible, disgusting creature who chases after a young boy's organs...and he made a movie!  Ahem.  I digress.  Water under the bridge.<br />Dari and Trish are on their way home from college.  Of course, they are taking the long, out-of-the-way road where two people went missing over twenty years ago.  They are nearly run off the road by a beat-up, menacing truck that seems to have a life of its own.  Later, they see the occupant of the truck dumping something (a body?) into a large pipe.  He turns and watches them drive past.  This is the best shot in the movie!  This time they do get run off the road and Dari wants to go back and see what's in the pipe (idiot).  At the bottom Dari finds something disturbing (I'm sure you can guess), so they high tail it out of there to the nearest diner.  Dari gets a call from a psychic who tells him to watch out for the song Jeepers Creepers, `cause that's when HE'LL come.<br />We then get into the best horror sequence of 2001.  Someone notices the Creeper going through Dari's things out in the car.  Dari and Trish offer to take the police to the secret pipe but the Creeper attacks during and awful rock version of Jeepers Creepers (I'm sure you can guess what happens to the police escort).  It's the second best shot in the film!  Dari and Trish escape to Eileen Brennan's farm and shoot it out with the Creeper.  \\"That ain't my scarecrow!\\" .  Pretty cool sequence.<br />From there it's off to the police station and a big battle between the local P.D. and the Creeper.  I won't reveal the ending, but I will say it just seems like they cut out the entire third act.  It just ends.<br />Jeepers Creepers got a lot of negative reviews when it was released.  I can guess why.  Most critics don't know how to review a horror film.  It doesn't conform to the other rules of cinema.  All you have to do is tell a scary story and this one works more often than it doesn't.  The problem I have with it is; when it doesn't work, it REALLY doesn't work.  The Miss Cleo character is the most striking example.  She's put there to reveal necessary information to save Dari's and Trish's lives, but at a critical moment she refuses to help them because they might have a negative reaction to her information.  Huh?  Dari's reason for going down the pipe isn't really that good either.  Salva scripted and would do well to let a better screenwriter handle the reigns of Jeepers Creepers 2.  Yes, it's coming.<br />The DVD offers just about everything you could want.  Commentary.  Deleted Scenes.  Making ofs.  <br />On the whole this is a pretty good horror movie.  Reminiscent of Dean Koontz's Phantoms or Jason Goes to Hell.  Hollywood can do better horror, but this will do until the next wave come in.
0446677450|4.0|Well, I was a little suprised that more effort was not put into making the book flow more eloquently. Other than that I absolutely loved every morsel of information. This book has really prepared me to take the proper steps to avoid another genreation of poverty in my family. I know now what it takes and am prepared to do it, all thanks to Kiyosaki and Letcher
B000002KET|4.0|A transitional album; a departure from the first four Sabbath albums. It seems that, after their initial sound reached their peak in their fantastic fourth album, 'Volume 4', they started seeking new ways to express themselves. Here, we see the first steps towards a new sonic direction, a direction that later brought some very interesting releases (the majestic Sabotage being one of them). I am not sure why this CD is considered by many a 'Sabbath trademark'. This is clearly not the most representative sample of the 'traditional' Sabbath music, but rather a deviation, an experimental CD, with heavy doses of keyboards, done by Rick Wakeman. You cannot tell though who plays the keyboards, as Rick's mastery (amptly displayed in 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII') is not present here. The only song that is somehow enhanced by the use of keyboards is 'Sabbra Cadabra'. 'Who Are You' is, of course, totally synth based, but, other than a strong instrumental chorus, it does not have much to offer. Overall, SBS, is not nearly as sinister as the front cover suggests (perhaps a 'landscape' cover or something like that would have been more appropriate), and contains some very quiet music, alongside some heavy stuff. The only song that reflects the past is 'Killing Yourself To Live' (it could have been part of Vol 4). 'Fluff', an exquisite instrumental, also reminds of 'Laguna Sunrise'. 'A National Acrobat' is 'side one's' stronger moment. It blends a folk melody with some very heavy stuff with originality. Another interesting song is 'Looking for Today', simple hard rock served with a strong dose of melancholy. It could have been shorter, though, and less repetitive. These are good songs, but I think the real masterpiece of SBS is the symphonic 'Spiral Architect', one of Sabbath's finest moments ever. It starts with a long beautiful acoustic introduction, and develops into a powerful and majestic composition. A sign of things (and sounds) to come in Sabotage and subsequent albums. Three and a half (four) star for creativity and effort and for some brilliant moments. Overall, an interesting release, but by no means the best Sabbath album. If you are a Sabbath fan, chances are that you already own this album. If you are not, this may not be the best place to begin. Not that it is a bad album, but it takes a while to click into it.
B00004U30D|5.0|I wanted to see American Beauty a long time ago, but a friend commented on how this movie was \\"only about sex.\\"  No doubt she was completely wrong and if some of you gave it a few stars, you must've merely glanced at its surface. American Beauty the dysfunctional emotions that occur within a seemingly \\"normal\\" family.  It makes you think of life itself.  The acting was really, really good.  I'm not going to repeat the plotline, but everyone with a mature mind must see this movie.  It is, indeed, a level higher than the typical movies out now that offer only surface-entertainment value.
0780020685|5.0|I probably watch this film once a month.  Every detail that defines superb film making is addressed in this masterpiece:  story, character development, drama, humor, action... the list goes on and on.  <br />Also, the acting by Toshiro Mifune is some of his best work.  And, like all of Kurosawa's films, the compositions of images on screen is flawless.  His eye for visuals is one of the very best.<br />Although 3+ hours long, the movie flies by.  Required viewing for any one who enjoys classic films, foreign, samurai flicks, or just plain quality.
B0000634EV|5.0|This album deserves 5 stars if for nothing else, the fact that it is a resounding throwback to the heyday of what metal music should be. It's heavy, weed induced, bluesy and ferociously soulful. What is most heartening is that there is melody with the blunt force and the members actually can play. Great riffs, changes within songs and guitar solos abound. This outfit have been touted as a southern metal supergroup. Collectively, they're better than any of their full time bands. Phil Anselmo is much more effective here than with Pantera. He actually sings instead of grunts. Pepper Keenan (C.O.C. guitarist/frontman) is the main reason I was intrigued by Down in the first place. C.O.C. is also just as overlooked. These two make it go. They feed well off one another and supposedly are old buddies which is a good thing for us. I've only heard this once all the way through  but it's like NOLA (Down's stellar previous effort) but with more polish. Anselmo is a frontman/singer rather than a zit covered painted face poseur that never worked a day in his life, much less suffered through any real hardship. Down II isn't quite as raw or heavy as NOLA, but it still is packed with southern metal soul. The riffs are monstrous and continue to be variations on Iommi's finer moments with the mighty Sab. Down however, has a sound all its own. Anselmo and Pepper Keenan are  solid songwriters for this style (see Keenan's lyrical prowess on C.O.C.'s last 5 albums). Down is in the neck of the woods I thought Metallica would be by now-somewhat underground but straightforward and peerless. These guys salute yesteryear while remaining fresh a la The Black Crowes (70's rock n roll), Gov't Mule (70's rock, blues, jazz improvisation), Tool(70's prog rock/metal). This is a metal album through and through. It will be overlooked by the masses, but it shouldn't be. It merits some attention just due to the fact that it is what it is, unpretentious and loaded with attitude. Every song is a standout.Are you down with Down?
0671042858|2.0|I haven't read a lot of Stephen King's books, but from the few I have read, I can honestly say he's capable of better than this.<br />(I believe even Mr King admitted as much.)<br />There is very little character development, which gives one little reason to care if Trisha escapes the woods, in fact you pretty much know she will.
B000001Y5J|4.0|Hey, to me the mark of a good album is if it stands the test of time, and to me this does. I just picked up the CD after owning the cassette and not having a tape deck for years. It still manages to sound just as powerful, and fresh as ever. I really feel that Trent, when making an album has the idea in mind to make his work sound fresh for years and years, unlike similar artists who's records sound dated after a few years. Either Broken was ahead of it's time in '92 or it's just damn good,or  more likely both.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is funny, creepy, and just plain weird but not once does it go over the top. For some reason it makes you think that time travel and a demonic rabbit named Frank could easily exist in reality without having to give it a second thought. The acting is along the same lines as the plot; weird, creepy, but good and it never gets to be too much to take. I was skeptical about actually liking a movie with Drew Barrymore, but her character played a small role. She was also able to tone down the parts of her acting that make me cringe. <br />This movie is just plain bizzare, and I love it for exactly that. I can't wait to see it again.
B00005V331|5.0|So here it is again, the legendary debut album from Venom and nothing really could prepare you then and nothing can prepare you now for the evil din contained within this classic piece of outrage. Lets see there are Satanic themes, violent guitars, thundering bass and growling vocals. Perfect indeed. Be warned its rough and very under produced yet you can't help going back and giving your ears another bashing like a glutton for punishment. Musically speaking I guess a parallel to say 'Motorhead' crossed through a thermo nuclear meltdown with 'Black Sabbath' could best describe this CD's contents, though that doesn't even come close to describing the OTT delivery given. No where near as fine and refined as its follow up in 'Black Metal' this is indeed a different kind of horned beast. Every song is loud, frenzied and obnoxious though 'Live Like An Angel' is the most tuneful and 'In League With Satan' the most hummable. It can take time to ingest the contents but the bands enthusiasm will win you over to the dark side over time. There are real songs and great ideas hidden under the roughness so persist at all costs. The bonus trax are also well worth a visit in particular the 'Angel Dust' (lead weight version)which I think improves on its eventual cut and the 'Red Light Fever' demo version. Forgive them father for they knew exactly what they were doing!
B0000634EV|5.0|Anyone remember that?  I remember that there was almost no such thing as rap-metal and Korn was just starting to make a big name for theirselves.  I bought the first Down album, \\"Nola\\" because it had the two frontmen from two of my favorite bands.  Hearing them do their thing with a slower, more Sabbath like feel and giving the whole thing a dark, Southern flair, was like a dream come true.  Now that's been nearly seven years, I've gotten way out of touch with what's happening in the metal world.  Actually, I've gotten way out of touch with what's been happening in mainstream music.  I'm not sure where it was, but I saw an ad for the second Down album and put it on my \\"gotta have\\" list.  <br />Now that it's here, does it live up to the first?  Hell yes.  It actually takes what was started with \\"Nola\\" and improves. What's on here sounds so good that you're likely to forget that the guy singing also fronts another band by the name of Pantera.  Yes, Phil still likes to use his trademark, gutteral roar, but he also likes to slow it down and sing too.  I really don't know what to call the new Down album.  I'm just gonna say that it's downright great music and needs to be picked up by anyone who claims to be a metal fan.  Also, if you're bored to death with all of the nu-metal that's going on right now, pick this up and re-new your faith.
080013558X|5.0|I do not know why so many people are downing this movie.  True, I have never seen the Broadway production, but I HAVE seen Disney's production, and for me nobody will ever be Annie but Aileen Quinn.  Carol Burnett was an excellent Miss Hannigan (I just couldn't get into Kathy Bates playing the role), and Ann Reinking was by far a better choice for Grace (I'm sorry but in the 1930s the likelihood of Grace being a woman of color are slim, and Daddy Warbucks giving her an engagement ring even slimmer -- PLEASE!!).  I love this movie and so do my children, especially my daughter Lauren who always asks whenever they want to watch a movie,  &quot;Annie!!  Please, can I watch Annie?&quot;  This movie rocks!!
B000063CPL|5.0|From the opening it brought back the memories of seeing them on the tour in San Diego, CA and Irvine, CA. From the opening of THE WICKER MAN to the finale of RUN TO THE HILLS this cd is a must have for any MAIDEN fan. It was great to hear Bruce do versions of SIGN OF THE CROSS and THE CLANSMAN, much better than Blaze Bayley. There is 6 songs from the BRAVE NEW WORLD cd which are brilliantly done. They didn't forget the classics and they are done very well with Adrian, Janick, & Dave on guitars. The recording of this cd is very well done, the best since Live After Death. I didn't think the recording of A Real Live Dead One or Live at Donington were that great so it was good to hear the recording back to greatness, Kevin Shirley must have had a lot to do with the producing. If I can recommend one cd to by that has just been released, this would be it. I can't wait for them to come out with a new album.
B00003CWL6|4.0|There are so many ways why I can say American Beauty was my favorite movie (next to Moulin Rouge) but I can say that this was my first 'love' my first favorite movie. I was the unfortunate one to not see it in theatres, when everyone did. But, the Trailer for American Beauty got me thinking a lot about how they put these strange scenes together. After watching it on video I was in Awe! (I wanted to see it on DVD first but I couldn't wait) All of the visually stunning scenes, cinematography and dialogue made me love this film. There is something very Beautiful about the way this movie flew from one scene to the next. The fantacies of Lester towards Angela was incredible and rather funny (especially the gym scene). And the final scene in the end made me see why this was the winner for Best Picture. This is truly one of the great films that people should see to get the real raw emotions that the actors/actresses portrayed in American Beauty.

B00005Q4CS|2.0|This could be a good movie, but the choppy editing and uneven story made it difficult to enjoy.  There are some good performances by the stars of the film, but they don't overcome the poor story line.  If you don't have it, don't buy it.
B00005R5G9|3.0|Andrew McCarthy was just becoming a screen regular when he starred as a quirky artist named Jonathan Switcher in Mannequin. Somehow, when the mannequin he is designing comes to life -- in the person of Emmy, played by Kim Cattrall -- he is obsessed with his creation. Sparks fly, the two fall in love, and then their world turns into mayhem. Far-fetched? Yes. Entertaining? Sometimes.<br />McCarthy is everyone's favorite smartass -- the things that he says that are cute on-screen would get your average quirky artist's butt kicked three ways from Sunday. Cattrall, meanwhile, hadn't yet developed much in the way of acting ability. At times, she seems more lifeless than the mannequin she portrays, but she's always cute and bubbly. The biggest treat is Meshach Taylor as Hollywood Montrose, a window display designer who is always in fashion and whose briefs lines are usually gems.<br />All-in-all, Mannequin is a pleasant enough film, and there are some nice laughs and romantic moments along the way. Just don't expect too much out of it, and be prepared for the lulls that set in about halfway through.
B00005QW5X|5.0|There are a very few films that I actually RESPECT and Hedwig and the Angry Inch is one of them. For my money, this film is as good a musical as Bob Fosse's \\"All that Jazz\\" and &quot;Cabaret.&quot; It is a film that changes the viewers perception of the world and it delivers maximum entertainment without putting a step wrong. <br />The DVD is nothing short of brilliant, containing a 1.5 hour doco on the making, deleted scenes (some of them very funny) and other features. <br />This is one of the best films AND one of the best DVD releases I have ever seen. 10/10
B00005JKMQ|1.0|Excuse me?  \\"His uncanny re-creation of Ali's most famous weapon, his mesmerizing voice?\\"  One of my biggest criticisms of this film is that Smith doesn't sound anything like Ali.  It's almost as if someone said, \\"Listen, Will, your voice isn't close to Ali's so don't even try.  Just let your acting do the talking.\\"...<br />I won't dwell on the historical details of the film.  As it was said in another review, the film tries to cover so much history that it ends up covering nothing.  We get headlines instead of stories.<br />In short, this film has very little punch.<br />(Review of theatrical release)
0812523334|5.0|There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world. It's a wonderful book for young girls as the lessons to be learned in it are numerous. Read it with your daughter and you won't regret it.
0385503954|5.0|Never before have I finished a book and then immediately returned to page 1 to read through the entire thing again. That is what this book forced me to do. The delightful story was worth another trip through to see it again. <br />I highly recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a great story whether they think that the subject matter is for them or not. Because it consists of interesting and well-developed characters, the resulting story is one that I am confident in saying anyone would be glad that they experienced. <br />Whether you are propelled through the book by the master craftsmanship of the prose or the suspense of the story, you may read it again to catch what you missed. A fun read, but one you will respect in the morning.
B00005Y228|5.0|Ms. Minogue's recent offering, Fever, (the U.K. top album for awhile now), has hit big in America! Obviously thought to be a good enough album for the sates, it was offered to us and thank you much!  This album is a groove, pop, tech, and at times retro sound fusion that just works well.  Of course, as a pop album, we have the obligatory catchy tunes as &quot;Can't Get You Outta My head&quot; ( with limited lyrics, but works), &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot;,and others, but hey it's a pop album, what should we expect.  In any case the production is good, from well put together instrumentation, timed just right, and more importantly Kylie's astoundingly great voice that ranges from seductive to sweet to assured.  Moreover, the album progresses as you here it making repeat hearings frequent.  Maybe you'll shelve this one after awhile, but you'll definately return to it and enjoy it.  A definate treat album among all the raunchy rock, pop, and rap that is out there today.  I am not necessarily a Minogue fan, but I have catched the Fever, and am giving credit where credit is due.

B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer's CD is really great.  It took two or three listens for me to really get into it, but once there, you can't but notice how very talented a songwriter and performer Mayer is.  I appreciate the youthful outlook, dealing with relationships, love life, especially in song's like &quot;Your body is a wonderland.&quot;  He writes very catchy pop tunes.  Due to the simple rock instrumentation, (I actually enjoy simple production value, which is something missing today, the need to put everything plus to kitchen sink on a record), the songs do end up sounding too much the same, especially once you begin delving deeper into the later songs on the CD.  I look forward to hearing more from John, and hearing him live.  Its great to hear a record like this in this day and age, and builds my faith that quality pop/rock still does exist.  Thumbs up!
630438551X|4.0|This brash \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" is unlike any other film version that preceded it and is guaranteed to make a strong impression whatever its flaws. The old world gentility of Zeffirelli's vision has been brutally stripped away here, leaving a film that blazes with potent imagery and throbs with the violence of adolescent passion. I found the translation deeply unsettling at first, but once I relaxed and allowed myself to admire the filmmakers' inventiveness, I realized that this version was both stunningly creative and, in its way, quite true to Shakespeare's tragic tale of star-crossed teenage love.
B000003S0Z|5.0|Even though \\"Another Green World\\" is so much more groundbreaking in terms of where Eno would go after his first couple of records, \\"Before and After Science\\" is my personal favorite of the two. Eno has an interesting way of keeping the songs rooted to their original themes (unlike \\"Dead Finks\\" from HCTWJ), and I think this makes them more accesible. Also the fact that the original themes are very simple. Although the tracks range over all sorts of musical styles and ideas, they seem to be unified in some way, I don't know what...<br />My favorite tracks are \\"Energy Fools The Magician\\" and \\"Spider and I\\". The first is an example of an Eno \\"collage\\", you can see how all sorts of little pieces were shoved together to make the track. The latter is one of Eno's best \\"minimalist words\\" pices, where no word in the lyrics can be removed without hurting the whole. Also, some fabulous synthesizer work on this one, almost as good as \\"Becalmed\\" from AGW.<br />I never had the vinyl, but I can imagine how the break in sides would benefit the structural arrangement of the album. The idea of having two contrasting sides on the album was something Eno had wanted David Bowie to do in Berlin (he didn't do it for \\"Low\\" but finally did on \\"Heroes\\"), and the 4 pictures that come with the album are a realizatin of the \\"Sound And Vision\\" idea, also created with Bowie, where the sound is the album, and the vision is the 4 pictures.<br />In essence, this album combines the \\"pop\\" stylings of HCTWJ and TTMBS with the \\"ambient\\" ideas first expressed on \\"AGW\\". If you want good Eno, this (along with \\"AGW\\" and \\"Thursday Afternoon\\") should be your first buy.
B000059H98|5.0|Ok well I know this one isn't for everyone and yes it is dumb but I really loved this movie. I own it on DVD and VHS.<BR>Young girls will love it, although it is rated R. I think it can be shown to 12 or 13 year olds. Great for their self-esteem.<BR>Tank Girl rocks! Hurray!
B0000033TE|4.0|The ultimate Progressive Rock album, wedding ELP's symphonic style with the manic insanity of King Crimson, the conceptual largesse of Jon Anderson, and the over-the-top flamboyancy of Roxy Music...it's like a Prog compilation or \\"best of\\" - but it's not!<BR>The album starts with \\"Jerusalem\\", a nice arrangement but really only a prelude to the real stuff, another arrangement, this time of an argentinian Piano Concerto. Play this one at horrendously loud volume levels. Emerson's moog sounds like the sound effects for certain 80's computer games at some places. With that as a starter, they take us into a slightly quieter, gentler area, with the beautiful ballad \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\". This track features the second time ever on record of Robert Moog's \\"apollo\\" synthesizer, which could play more than one note at once. (the first was back on the \\"Jerusalem\\" cover.) \\"Benny The Bouncer\\" is okay, not my personal favorite though. BUT WAIT - all that has gone before is really only a massive introduction to the REAL real stuff, the enormous, half-hour-long epic \\"Karn Evil 9\\".<BR>Starting with a quiet (but showy) piano theme, the first movement builds into one of the greatest things I've ever heard. The lyrics are about the detatchment of our political leaders and the contrast between the poor and the wealthy (\\"starvig children shivering in the cold / are captured in the lenses of the jackals for gold\\"). Halfway through the song shifts to speak about a carnival, and Greg Lake does the part of a promoter showing his audience such thrills and chills as \\"Seven virgins and a mule\\". It's all about decadence; I think that the world of part 1 has now fallen into the even worse world of part 2. At the end of this movement the music builds into a tremendous crecsendo, with Carl Palmer's timpani playing a central part. The music crashes down to a majestic close amid shouts of \\"see the show\\", which is really the idea of the whole piece - that the world has been over-commercialized to the point of everyone searching for cheap thrills and not caring about real life anymore.<BR>But it's not over. A jazz piano comes up, as if to relieve us of the weighty concepts expressed earlier. This movement is pure music, no words, and a showcase of Emerson and Palmer's amazing virtuosity. All we can hold onto in a squalorous, decadent world is our arts, it says. But a splintery, overdriven moog comes to the front, reminding us of the threat of technology to distance us from higher ideals. The piano and synth trade back and forth for a while, with neither instrument seeming the clear victor. This makes way for the final movement, in which mankind awakes from their greed-lusty illusion dream and responds to the threat of destruction by the very servants they created - computers. The computers seem to be winning for a while, as the men seem baffled by the fact that the computers would want to destroy them.(\\"but I gave you life!\\" the man says.The computer responds, \\"what else could you do?\\"). But finally mankind defeats the menace, hopefully learning a lesson about materialism as well.<BR>Of course they don't. The last line is \\"our young men have not died in vain / the tapes have recorded thier names\\". Why did they not destroy all the computers in order to prevent another uprising? I believe it's because the present-oriented hedonists fighting the war couldn't see that far ahead.<br />And remember - all this impossibly complex music was played by only three people!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Many films based on books, whether they are good or not, do not usually capture the brilliance of the book. This film exceeds it. What's more, unlike a lot of films (Jurassic Park for example) the film version follows the book quite closely. It would be easy to pass off Fight Club as another violent male aggression film like Die Hard, but this is so much  more. It explores philosophies on life and has a deep and intricate plot.<br />If you like dark grim violent films, then you cannot go wrong with this. But this isn't mindless or even gratuitous. It has a superb storyline (which I won't ruin) but the jist of it is exploring both sides to someone's personality. The film is also very well scripted, with extra bits that the book didn't have. It changes here and there, and sometimes scenes have been twisted. But this is a true and justifiable interpretation of the novel.<br />Another great thing about this is the acting. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are all supurb. Carter prooves that being attractive doesn't mean you are automatically an airhead..., and although Pitt is the sort of bloke that other blokes love to hate (why are you punishing me God?!) the truth is that he is a very good acter, not just some guy with a cute ass who has wormed his way into your sister's heart. Lastly, there is Edward Norton. Pitt has the famous name which is perhaps why he is portrayed as the lead character (its kind of a cross between him and Norton really) but Norton is the narrater and he plays his part best in my opinion. But all three of them are fantastic.<br />The only pitfall is that the conclusion is not very well explained as it was in the book, but this does leave the viewer asking questions which is a good thing.<br />All in all this has everything - a great storyline plus great acting, directing and soundtrack to drive it through. Truly one of the best films I've ever seen.
B00000DR8R|5.0|Many things come with time: reflection and realisation are not the least of them. Listening to Lloyd Cole eighteen years after the original release of Rattlesnakes brings nothing but pleasure and warmth of memory. The album, like so much of Cole's work, is poised somewhere between absolute emotional torture and the panic of love. Every lyric tells the story of yet another painful four-minute love affair which crosses back and forth between love and excitement, fear and adrenaline.<br />There has yet to be a lyricist to come close to capturing such confusion, and the voice of Cole spreads a dark light over the words.. All this to the backing of delicate guitars (see Are You Ready To Be Heartbroken) and driving melodies (Perfect Skin). After eighteen years, the only realisation is that I should have kept listening.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Is This It? No really, is this it? And by 'it' I mean the next big thing - by 'it' I mean the saviours of rock. I mean really, am I the only person who thinks that listening to this when there's so much more out there is the musical equivalent of drinking juice coz you're not old enough to get sloshed? This truly is one of the most dull pieces of music I've ever heard. It has boring whiney vocals, terrible-sounding guitars playing God knows what, simple attempts at guitar soloing and amatuerish drumming. I know this isn't the sort of stuff I'm into but can someone who does like softer rock honestly claim that this is any good? I mean, I dislike other mainstream stuff like Underworld, stuff like Limp Bizkit, stuff like Britney Spears, but with all of those I can at least see where the appeal lies for those who do like it. At least Enrique whats-his-name and Nelly Fertado can sing.<br />The fact is that in order to save rock, a band are gonna need to be doing something original, and very often original means doing something that will be rejected by the mainstream, or people interpret it as making an album like this that, while doing something a bit original, doesn't succeed in doing anything worth listening to. I mean how many people here have heard of Opeth, The Afro-Celtic Sound System or even Tool? Three totally different groups doing something far more unique than this.<br />All in all, this is yet another terrible album that the media will grab onto because they can't open their eyes and look for anything better.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie starts with Leonard (Guy Pearce) shooting a man you later find out is Teddy.  The movie is told backwards (and I was told that at the beginning as kind of like a caution) so I thought the whole movie is going to be leading up to that scene.  Little did I know about the strange plot twists and almost too thought out of a script.  Christopher Nolan (Screenwriter and Director) excells in every aspect of writing a genius script. The dialogue is very real and the characters are fully developed.  There isn't one reason you shouldn't see this movie, unless you're under the age of around 12 because of the violence and lots of profanity.  But I warn you: Always keep an open head fre of distraction for this movie and some parts you may want to watch in slow motion.
B000059MEK|4.0|Daft Punk<BR>Discovery<BR>Virgin<br /> One for the time capsule, DISCOvery has a place in anyone's disco mobile. One thing we can learn from Daft Punk, is that it's okay to have no shame and dance like no one is watching. The French duo leaves behind their championed Homework debut and guides new and old listeners upon a trailblazing adventure of new wave  cheese laden with  vocoder friendly disco marvels  reminiscent of Chic and  early Prince. DISCOvery is every inch sublime as it is simple. With the lead off single, the progressive disco anthem \\"One More Time\\" (featuring house-vocalist -come-legend Romanathony), the record aims straight into the heart of pop-culture turning repetitive melodies into unexpected hooks. Others \\"Digital Love\\", \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" all share in equal crimes of causing dancefloor mayhem. Lyrically, DISCOvery  is as daft as punk, yet it doesn't  aspire to be intellectual in any way, only a record that replenishes the lacklustre dance floor friendly anthems of late and only reminds us oh how it was to groove on lit dancefloors, and make us smile.
0380729407|3.0|I tried to read this book several times when I was about thirteen (the age of the two boys in the story).  Although I was a Bradbury fan, and found the tone and premise intriguing, I could never get past the opening chapters, usually setting it aside about the time the carnival pulls into town.<br />35 years later, I finally read it.<br />I didn't lose anything by waiting, because I'm sure my younger self would have been disappointed.  This story has a lot to offer in terms of its philosophical mood, and has a haunting quality to it, but it's told in a surrealistic style that is not always clear, and Bradbury's prose is clotted with numerous tangled metaphors and sentences that make no literal sense.  It's still not what I'd call a difficult read; I whipped through it in a few days.  Bradbury maintains an element of suspense(more by suggestion than by clearly describing anything) and the conclusion, although slightly heavy-handed, is satisfying.<br />&quot;Something Wicked this way Comes&quot; reminds me of two books:  &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeleine L'Engle, a children's novel which made a tremendous impression on me when I was nine years old; and Stephen King's &quot;Needful Things&quot;, which has a similar theme.  There are probably dozens of stories using this theme; since this one was published 40 years ago it's not fair to call it derivative, but I'm not sure if it's genuinely original.  None of that really matters, though, since it's Bradbury's feel for the time and place, and his accurate depiction of the adolescent point of view that make this story effective, in spite of its frequent wordiness, obscurity, and overwriting.  Sometimes the best writers can get away with bad writing --- or what would be bad writing in the hands of a less capable author --- and that seems to me to be the case here.<br />As others have observed, it's not a horror novel; more of a dark fantasy with a positive underlying theme.  I find it encouraging that so many young people are reading and enjoying this book; although I'm not wild about it, it's likely to whet the appetite for further reading.<br />If you haven't read Bradbury before, I recommend the short story collections such as &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; or &quot;October Country&quot;; or the novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and the collection of linked stories that forms his masterpiece &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;people are reading and enjoying this book; although I'm not wild about it, it's likely to whet the appetite for further reading.<br />If you haven't read Bradbury before, I recommend the short story collections such as &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; or &quot;October Country&quot;; or the novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and the collection of linked stories that forms his masterpiece &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot;
B00005O3VC|5.0|Being a teenager, I was very unsure when my dad suggestedf comedy that was supposedly tame enough for PBS. I rented this movie just to cover up that I had also rented American Pie 2, but this was the better of the two. I can't stop myself from quoting it anymore. <br />By the way, I need a shrubbery, so give me one or I shall say &quot;Ni!&quot;
B00005JKED|3.0|This was not a movie that makes a person feel good after watching it. It was about a bunch of Police officers who are criminals and killers and think this is the right way to be. I think the acting was good, all the actors did a fine job &amp; the ending was just. I would not recommend this movie since this movie did not make me want to watch it to the end or have a positive message.
B000002G7G|5.0|Here I go ahead where many have gone before to write about the Velvet Underground. All of their albums are essential for one way or another, the first two mainly for the fact that nothing else sounds like them (an achievement considering how many have copied them). The last is simply so catchy. However it's their third that is most wonderful. The songwriting is simple, and concern universal topics, such as love, fear of rejection, moments of happiness, loneliness etc... As such the songs seem to speak to you, recognise how you feel, live and simply 'are'. Linked to the fact that they are simple songs, based around a chord or two, your not being asked to any long solos or anything of the sort. Mo Tucker's vocals on &quot;After Hours&quot;, are beautiful and fragile.
078062565X|5.0|\\"King Kong\\" is one of the truly great classics of our time.  No matter how sophisticated our movie special effects become, nothing will ever top the craftmanship of Willis O'Brien's cast of prehistoric animals.  Fay Wray's gutteral screams, along with the \\"hard-boiled ballyhoo\\" approach to both movie acting and dialogue of the early 1930's, make this film a classic of all time.  This film deserves full and complete DVD treatment, hopefully from Criterion, with a pristine print, detailed commentaries and loads of extras.  Only an A class treatment would do justice to one of the movies' true \\"movies\\".  A note of purported Hollywood trivia:  when James Cameron supposedly offered Fay Wray the role of old Rose in \\"Titanic\\", he told her that she would be a part of the biggest movie of her long career.  Her priceless reply was supposedly, \\"I don't need \\"Titanic\\"- I have \\"King Kong\\"!\\"  Indeed she has, and so do movie audiences, for ALL TIME!
078311513X|5.0|If you've never picked up a hitchhiker you never will after seeing this film. If you have, I'm sure you'll think twice the next time you see one.<br />When The Hitcher first appeared to me on HBO back in 1986 it became my all time favorite movie. Still to this day it is one of my favorite movies and one of the most breathtaking thrillers I've seen. <br />The story about a young driver (Jim Haulsey), played by Thomas C. Howell, delivering a drive-a-way car to California. On his way through a small town he picks up a strange hitchhiker named John Ryder(Rutger Hauer) hoping that the hitcher will keep him awake. Well, that he certainly does. John tells Jim a gruesome tale of murdering the previous family that picked him up. Jim then throws him out of the car. Throughout the rest of the film there is a lot of suspense and quite the cat and mouse game played by the hitcher and his victim, Jim.<br />It's hard for me to put in to words how good this movie is. I could go on forever about the plot but you'll never get a true feeling of how thrilling The Hitcher really is. Don't take my word for it. Check this one out yourself and I'm sure you won't be sorry.
B000002UEB|5.0|the best ever, no questions asked-  never heard of Queensryche?  oh well, gotta hear it for yourself. Best progressive metal band ever formed. Geoff Tate rocks, riffs rocks, Iron Maiden style- buy, you will not be disappointed.  EMILY!!!...--
0783235607|4.0|Called the grandaddy of all horror movies, Psycho is not only a great thriller but a great movie as well. <br />From the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock(Vertigo, The Birds)comes a tale of a shy young hotel owner named Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins) and a theif on the run named Marion Crane. Norman is dominated by his mother and does everything she tells him to do. If that means committing murder, well that's what he'll do. Everyone knows of the infamous shower scene. <br />Psycho spawned a few sequels but will never match the power of the original. I'm a big fan of horror movies, and though I wouldn't say psycho is a \\"horror\\" movie, I will say most horror movies Such as Halloween were inspired by this classic of classics.

B00005ATQI|4.0|Probably Stephen King's best work. The shining is one of the creepiest, spookiest movies ever made. If your looking for blood and gore this movie wouldn't be for you. If you want an eerie feeling and some spine-tingling this may be for you.<BR> <BR>Despite hearing a horrifying tale of the previous hotel keeper(Grady) that lost his mind and brutally slaughtered his wife and twin daughters Jack Nicholson(Jack Torrence)and Shelly Duval(Wendy Torrence) decide to watch over a hotel in the mountains during the off season. Jack feels the quiet will help him finish the novel he's been working on. They bring along their young son Danny. Danny has a special ability to communicate telepathically. As the days go along the Jack begins losing his mind and we begin seeing the eerie visuals of the previously murdered family. The plot is a strong one. It starts off slow but builds to a great climax.<br />This movie is certainly is remembered for two things I believe. The scene where King spills gallons and gallons of blood out of the elevator and the line \\"Here's Johnny\\" as the crazed Nicholson chops down the door with an axe in pursuit of his wife.<br />Whether your a fan of suspenseful thrillers, a Stephen King fan, or just a fan of a well made movie The Shining is worthy of your collection.
B00005UWBP|5.0|This is the most incredible movie I have seen in a long time.  The graphics are incredible and the story line intriguing!
B00005YW4H|2.0|The music's good, but Norah Jones' voice just isn't enough of a voice to listen to a whole album.  It lacks timbre and depth and richness and that made it difficult for me to listen to it more than a few times.  None of her renditions stayed with me past the drive into work.
0380796090|4.0|Although this is Ms. Keyes' first book, I have read four of her others before reading this one. Now I wish I would have read this one first so my expectations weren't so high. <br />The central characer of the book is Claire, whose husband whom she deeply loves annouces that he has been having an affair and is leaving her while she is still in the hospital after giving birth to their first child. Claire flees her marital home in London to return to her family home in Ireland where she has a total breakdown, manages to loose her&quot;baby weight&quot; and meet a new love interest just about the time her philandering husband decides to kiss and make up. <br />Had I not read those other four Keye's novels I would have probably given this one five stars instead of four, but after reading about Claire's sister Rachel in Keyes' Rachel's Holiday and other stronger characters in subsequent books I found Claire to be rather lackluster. She's missing the &quot;oomph&quot; of Lucy Sullivan, the pizazz of Tara in Last Chance Saloon and the spark of Lisa in Sushi for Beginners, all also by Keyes. Claire's family members, however, are dazzling jewels from her clueless father to her nasty sister Helen (who I just LOVE!) and they alone are enough to make this a good read. I can't WAIT to read more about this amusing family in Keyes' upcomming new novel. <br />My advice is if you are new to Keyes this is a great jumping off place - it only gets better from here.
B00000064G|5.0|I just discovered this album recently, which is strange since it is probably his best and I've been listening to Drake for about a year now.  I first came across Nick Drake through \\"Way to Blue,\\"  a sort of greatest hits album, I guess, and I've collected a few mp3's, but this is the first true album that I've owned of Nick Drake.  And I must say - even though I've only heard it four or five times so far - that it is one of those rare gems that actually seems to reach that supposedly asymtopic level of perfection.  Every song on here is a beauty.  This is one of those albums that you'd buy over and over if necessary.  (The only ones that I've ever bought more than once are OK Computer and The Wall..  pretty good company I'd say)  The guitar-playing is sublime -- simple, tasteful, beautiful...  It reminds of Spinal Tap: \\"like lines intertwining\\" -- sounds like it couldn't be done by just one instrument.  You forget you're listening to a guitar and just absorb the melodies and counterpoint. The lyrics will [amaze] you.  They are pure humanity expressed in mundane words.  Wonderful.  But more than anything, it is the voice that defines this album.  That low, raspy, sweet tone that taps into your mind, builds a channel to ecstacy, and keeps you hovering in a state of bliss and pain for half an hour.  (Its a short album.)  This is an album that you NEED to have, and you need to listen to it at home by yourself first, and then share it with one person at a time.  Don't talk while you listen to it, there is nothing that can be said.
B000000HTK|5.0|Released in 1975, after a 4-year hiatus following the stunning PAWN HEARTS,  GODBLUFF came as a surprise to many American fans who thought they had heard the last of Van der Graaf as a band.  Maintaining the same personnel as their last recording -- Peter Hammill, Hugh Banton, David Jackson and Guy Evans -- the band blasts back with a vengeance.  The four lengthy songs contained here are replete with their strongpoints and the trademark sound -- in this case, not a bad thing -- that listeners and fans had come to expect.  The songs flow together almost as one continuous piece -- the band is obviously enjoying its rebirth.  Repeated listenings -- as with all of their work -- reveal different insights and aspects both to the music and the lyrics.<br />This recording was followed in short order by the stunningly beautiful -- and powerful -- STILL LIFE and WORLD RECORD, all three albums being released in the span of less than two years.  It seemed at the time that their hiatus had ended like a cork being blown out of a bottle.<br />This is a great 'come-back' album -- and simply a fine example of the work of one of the greatest progressive rock ensembles of our time.
B00005RYKV|5.0|Acclaimed director Takeshi Kitano -winner of the Golden Lion in Venice '97 for his film \\"Fireworks\\"- is again behind the camera directing Brother, his ninth film to date. Kitano also plays the role of the main character as he has done in most of his films.<br />The movie tells us the story of Yamamoto, a member of the Yakuza -the Japanese Mob-, who is expelled from the brotherhood he belongs to due to the betrayal of several members of his clan. He's given up for dead and moves from Tokyo to Los Angeles where he has a younger brother who survives as a modest drug dealer. Then, they begin to wipe out their opponents and thanks to Yamamoto's courage and insight they will become a powerful clan that controls several city areas. However, on their way to seize power, they meet their match and things will begin to go downhill. I won't spoil the ending but I must say that it's a thrilling and emotive one.<br />Kitano offers to the audience an electrifying portrayal of the Yakuza, its motivations and, most of all, its code of honor. The film can also be described as a tragedy because there's a sense of fatality which indicates that everything in the movie moves toward their end. The film depicts the state of mind of a man(Yamamoto)who has lost everything in which he believed and who has become a stateless person, an uprooted drifter shunned from his cultural environment with a ticket of no return.<br />As in other previous films by this director, deadpan humor is also present but perhaps not so constant as in other movies. There's also an underlying parody of the genre of action and noir films in the realistic and, at the same time, exaggerated way that Kitano describes violence.<br />Another remarkable aspect is the marvellous soundtrack composed by Kitano's longtime collaborator, Joe Hisaishi. A tranquil and melodic score that apparently contrasts with the violence that surrounds the film and which features orchestral and minimal music accompanied by free jazz and rock with absolute perfection in an unparalled exercise of emotional intensity.<br />To finish I'll just say that, in my humble opinion, Brother is an exciting film that is worth seeing and which proves, one more time, that Takeshi Kitano is one of the most talented and distinctive filmmakers of our days.absolute perfection in an unparalled exercise of emotional intensity.<br />To finish I'll just say that, in my humble opinion, Brother is an exciting film that is worth seeing and which proves, one more time, that Takeshi Kitano is one of the most talented and distinctive filmmakers of our days.
B000000HTL|5.0|On this, their third studio recording, Van der Graff Generator exploded into the progressive rock scene as a band that would set high standards -- for itself and for others -- that would be difficult to match, in any genre.<br />The core of the band -- the membership that would come to be considered the 'classic' incarnation of the band -- has obviously gelled by the time of this recording.  Lyricist/vocalist Peter Hammill's development as both a singer and a poet is truly beginning to shine here.  The contributions of the other members -- Hugh Banton on organ, David Jackson on saxes and flutes, and Guy Evans on percussion -- have come together, aided by time and touring, to form a cohesive whole, one of the most powerful sounds then or now.  The sound is pretty unique for the times -- with the absence of an electric lead guitar (with the notable exception of a guest contribution by King Crimson guitar wizard Robert Fripp, a long-time friend of VdGG) -- allowing Banton's organ and Jackson's winds to dominate, joined by Hammill's work on piano and Guy Evans' powerful and sensitive percussion.<br />Hammill's lyrics were always the focus of the band -- with a talent and vision such as he possesses, that is inevitable.  Besides his several recordings with the band, he has around 30 solo albums to his credit, and is still an active recording artist with a large world-wide cult following.  Some of the members of Van der Graaf work with him from time to time.<br />H to HE, along with its follow-up, PAWN HEARTS, showcase this amazing band at the height of their creative powers -- and after over 30 years, they still possess the fire they revealed in new realese.  The music still has the power.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Makaveli is arguably Tupac Shakur's greatest record.  Released just a few months after his untimely death, and featuring some of the most disturbing lyrics from this man who supposedly went mad after he was shot 5 times the first time.  But to me, that shooting just opened his eyes.  Extremely prophetic and poetic with so many references to death and him calling out the fake busters which really made no sense back then but makes perfect sense today.  (Jay-Z fell off the worst and Mobb Deep went straight soft, Dr. Dre is really showing signs of his other side with his appearance although he still makes tight beats, Nas is the only one that has maintained his illness.)  The production if I must say is excellent.  Tupac's flow is sick the whole way through, opting for his slow flow a little more on this album.  Me & My Girlfriend; one of Pac's greatest songs, is a chilling metaphor about his gun.  I didn't catch on to the metaphor until someone actually pointed it out to me, but that makes that song so much more special.  He disses and dismisses Jay- Z, Nas and Mobb Deep on Against All Odds-another chilling battle track packed with anger and lyrical adeptness, and Bomb First.  These three artists are now all mysteriously beefing...  Tupac takes stabs at Dr. Dre as well on Toss It Up and To Live & Die In LA.  <br />On this album you could tell that his patience was wearing thin and his trust for others except his real friends had already faded.  This is one of the most open portraits of this misunderstood troubled man.  Krazy, White Man'z World, Hold Ya Head are all classics and drop knowledge.  Tupac really was a special person and it is a shame he had to take the thug way to his demise.  He was one of the few that could drop thug lyrics about killing and mean it, and then on the next song drop knowledge about the school systems, education, and enlightenment, politics, treating of females and other positive things and mean it.  The guy was believeable and behaved justlike a real person; not just a straight thug unloving women hater but not no biatch softie crybaby either.  He was extremely introspective and observant and for that alone Makaveli is a classic.  But add in all the elements of a classic such as tight beats, potent lyrics, flawless flows, nice melodies and good choruses and you have yourself a masterpiece.
B000000HTO|5.0|When this album was released -- in 1976 -- hot on the heels of the band's 'come-back' effort, GODBLUFF, it was almost too much to endure.  The songwriting of Peter Hammill, and the musicianship of the incredible players present -- the VdG core of Hugh Banton, David Jackson and Guy Evans -- combined to make this one of the most stunning recordings this amazing group ever produced.  Hammill's lyrics and vocals were the strongest they had been in years -- and on a lyrical level, his songs had taken a turn with the band that listeners had previously experienced only on his (equally impressive) solo recordings.  They had gotten more personal -- no longer cloaking his emotions and feelings in the guises of other characters, Hammill's soul is laid more bare on this album than at any time in the past, to be matched and surpassed perhaps only on his as-yet unrecorded solo album OVER (one of the most painfully personal works I've ever heard).  The arrangements are alternately strong and delicate, showcasing the immense imaginations and talents of this band -- and the recording quality is the best of any of their efforts.<br />This album is not only a shining artifact of the best music of its era -- it's as powerful today as it was then, the mark of lasting art.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is a profoundly philosophical novel which focuses on realizing one's goals and then following one's heart to reach those goals.  The story begins in the fields of Andalusia, Spain.  Santiago, a young shepherd, has a recurring dream about a treasure.  When he goes to visit a woman who interprets dreams, sure enough, she tells him he is supposed to go find it.  With help and support from an old king, Santiago is on his way to Africa, towards the Egyptian Pyramids, to seek out his treasure.  Along his journey he meets a thief, a crystal merchant, an Englishman, and above all, an alchemist.  They each guide him closer to his treasure and Personal Legend.  A Personal Legend is what one is meant to fulfill in one's lifetime.  Paulo Coelho's inspiring novel brings forth a new light on the world and portrays the glass as half full.
079284632X|2.0|When Wes Craven first released this film in theatres people were literally getting sick and throwing up in the theatre it was also X rated. He was forced to retrim no telling how many times so therefor some lucky people out there may have seen the original version that clocked in at 95 mins in the theatres , or the version that is the most popular in older video stores with a large quality of horror titles that ran around 89 mins. I sadly only saw the 89 min version and it was good , but not as violent as I would have liked it to have been since I am a very huge gore fan. When MGM rereleased this film two years ago I jumped up and ran to get it stupidly thinking it would be a fully restored version because c'mon there have been alot more violent , repugnant , and disturbing films since this came out in 1972. I was wrong , not only was this not the completely restored version I was hoping for , it was even more censored then the version I had been familar with in the local video store. This MGM version is 82 mins ,and so heavily edited , and you can really tell by watching how censored it is that it could pass for a PG-13 by today's MPAA standards. I really hope Craven someday lets the original X rated (NC-17 now) version at 95 mins see the light of day because this doesnt cut it for me
B000002UAR|5.0|I can still remember the sixties; I liked classical and folk music (like Lonnie Donnegan) and fiercely turned my back on the Beatles.<BR>       Then Revolver came out. It was (and is) the only Beatle album I've ever bought or wanted to buy. Even now, listening to it gives me shudders of delight.
0064471837|5.0|I was surprised by the character of Sabriel in this novel.  She wasn't your typical heroine.  She was both a professional and an amateur, simultaneously.  She had a depth and you felt for her, even though she was, by nature, a woman who was not openly emotional.  I did find myself wanting to know more of the world Garth Nix created here, and I will be looking forward to reading his next installment set in the darkly gothic lands he created.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This is my absolutely #1, favorite, top of the list movie.  Lot of language but otherwise a definite 5 star.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This CD is my first introduction to the beautiful lady named Diana Krall that I've heard so much about over the years.  Bought her CD last week and have continued to revisit her sultry vocals and haunting strings at least 3X per day since.  I have since ordered all other Diana Krall CD's and am a fan.  Because I don't have any other initial first impressions of her my view is not tainted by what she did previously.  I enjoy the album over dinner, while intimate with my wife, when I first awaken, whenever.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The guy who wrote the amazon review doesn't get it and would appear to be a musically challenged knucklehead. I've been playing in bands and searching for good music for thirty five years and I will simply say that this guys has the goods. Anyone who has attempted songwriting will instantly appreciate the level of skill Mayer has demonstrated with these songs. At first listen the songs can superficially sound the same at some points but anyone who gives this CD repeated listening and pays attention to the melody, chord changes and bass lines will be rewarded. Mayer has an exceptional sense of melody and harmonic struture.  The CD is full of subtle melodic twists and unexpected chord changes and phrasing. You'll find something in each song that will catch you.  Given his age I thought the lyrics were good, great in some places. He may have to initially contend with comparisons to Dave Mathews but Mayer has a better voice, better songs and is a better guitar player.  Seeing him live will cap it as the live show delivers the energy and edge that can't come across on the CD.  His playing is sophisticated and the other band mambers are excellent as well. If you're looking for raw vocal delivery go elsewhere, Mayer is more Steely Dan than Rolling Stones.
0553345834|5.0|Mark McCormack is Founder, Chairman and CEO of sports marketing company International Management Group (IMG). He was named 'the most powerful man in sports' by Sports Illustrated.<br />In this book McCormack does not so much criticize Harvard Business School as the title suggests, but complements the traditional business school-education with 'street smarts' - \\"the ability to make active, positive use of your instincts, insights, and perceptions.\\" (Funnily enough, McCormack did not even attend the HBS, he has a law degree from Yale.) \\"My main purpose in writing this book is to fill in many of the gaps - the gaps between a business school education and the street knowledge that comes from day-to-day experience of running a business and managing people.\\" He splits the 'street smarts' and this book up into three parts: People, sales and negotiation, and running a business. With each part consisting of 4-to-6 chapters.<br />In the first part McCormack discusses matters related to people, such as reading people, creating impressions, preparation for business situations, and improving your career. \\"Business situations always come down to people situations. And the more - and the sooner - I know about the person I am dealing with, the more effective I'm going to be.\\" In the second part of the book - Sales and Negotiation - the author dicusses sales, negotiations and marketing. Sales and negotiations are probably the strongest point of both the book and McCormack, he really excels here. ...The third part of the book - Running a Business - is probably the weakest part of the book. Although there are some great one-liners, it is clear that the author is not that much at ease with writing about organization structures, policies and procedures. In fact, it looks like he despises most of these subjects. However, in the final chapter he provides some good advice for entrepreneurs and people thinking about starting their own business.<br />Yes, I do like this book. It is somewhatunconventional and is not really a business/management book. The examples from his experiences in sports marketing are exceptional and extremely useful. And yes, it is a great complement to the traditional business school-education (although they are now covering some of the subjects McCormack discusses, under the term 'emotional intelligence'). It is very simple to read and relatively short (250 pages). Recommended to managers and, yes also, MBA-students.
B0000634EV|5.0|This is an amazing album and much of it resembles early Pantera but still has the uniquness that is really starting to define Down. The blending of both these two styles is truly remarkable and a definitive milestone in Down's young history. Philip Anselmo is unbelevable as he really went back to his roots from early Pantera. Another high point was there bassist and fellow Pantera member Rex. His best work could very well be in this album, and he once again brought a sound that is impressive as it is powerful. Down's guitarists Kirk and Pepper have put together a very good package and couldn't have sounded or done any better. Then on drums is Jimmy who has a great grasp on what a good drummer. He knows how to carry a beat that you not only hear but feel it too. This is a remarkable album and if Down continues to put out more albums of this quality they could be a powerful force and could be around for decades to come
B00005YW4H|4.0|I don't know where this beautiful voice has been hiding, but she's ready to let the whole world enjoy it now.  She sings in a misty, throaty vioce that's so soothing you almost don't notice the words. I had never heard of her before a review in \\"People Magazine,\\" and she really is a joy to listen to,relaxing,smooth ,sexy and her choice of songs suits her lovely voice perfectly...
0440539811|5.0|I first read R.A. Wilson's epochal &quot;Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; twenty-five years ago and now, a quarter century later, find myself no less thrilled with it. <br />Not just one of my favorites, it is also one of the truly formative books I've read in my lifetime, and has prompted me to study - with greater or lesser seriousness and in greater or lesser depth - a wide range of esoterica, from the &quot;Principia Discordia,&quot; to the writings of Hakim Bey and Peter Lamborn Wilson, to the Kabbalah and Chaos Magick. <br />It has also prompted me to explore the role of a cultivated sense of humor as a spiritual path.<br />Rabelais said to his readers, &quot;For all your ills, I give you mirth.&quot;  Hagbard Celine, one of the heroes of &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; tells his devotees that Love will not free humankind, nor will political power nor force.  Rather, it is our imaginations that will liberate humankind to achieve the evolutionary zenith of its destiny.<br />To which this convinced Discordian adds a hearty &quot;Amen&quot; and, as the Illuminati say, &quot;Ewige Blumenkraft!&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|yes.  it is the best movie.  ever.
B0000634EV|5.0|Although not quite as good as Nola, this still rocks! Definitely has a Black Sabbath feel with a dash of Louisiana Hot Sauce. Definitely a lot of variety here as well. Of course we know they can rock, but they also pull off the ballad, Learn From This Mistake, with no problem at all! You must add this to your collection because who knows if they'll get together to do another one!
B0000028M7|4.0|All the imitators like Creed, Puddle of Mudd, Default and Drowning Pool sure makes one pine for the one band that got it right the first time.  Alice In Chains DEFINED the down-tuned angst rock that we are now sick of by the current crop of...wasting valuable air time on rock radio, but the original is still head and shoulders above the rest.  I don't know if its Layne Staley's controlled growl, or the harmonizing he does with guitarist and main songwriter Jerry Cantrell, or the abstract harmonics sprinkled throughout the album, but even 10 years later, this album stands out.  There is just something more musical about the CD than others, although the dischordant \\"Sickman\\" does venture into more grating territory.  \\"Them Bones\\" and \\"Dam That River\\" get things started with a bang, and there are many different phases along the way.  The best tunes are the mellowed-out \\"Rooster\\", the inspired riffing of the title track, the aforementioned 1-2 punch that kicks the CD off, the partly acoustic \\"Down In A Hole\\" and the classic closer \\"Would?\\", while \\"Hate To Feel\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\" are on the more formulaic side.  Overall, this album deserves a spot in every grunge fan's library, and merely by being musically strong, withstands the test of time.  \\"Dirt\\" is an unassuming, straightforward rock album that is unlikely to disappoint.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a cinematic masterpiece. Vibrant and spectacular, Baz Luhrman has created a fanciful world with the talents of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. The story is based on the Greek Orphean myth. But if you're looking to buy the DVD you probably already know what the story is all about. A general review of the DVD is what I'm trying to write about here.<br />The video is so clear and crisp that it finally does justice to Luhrman's imagination. Sound quality is just a little lacking, but overall, you get every note and lyric presented in this movie. You won't be amazed, but you certainly won't be disappointed. I only say it's lacking because as this is a musical, based on music and soung, I expected them to play extremely close attention to sound presentation. And I also hoped that some of the vocal drowning would be fixed, but it wasn't really. I guess it's my fault for being disappointed since I had high expectations.<br />The director's commentary didn't really talk about the movie as it was playing as much as I wish it would have. They mostly went off on tangents about their writing process which you also heard them talk about again on the 2nd disc. I was hoping for insight into certain scenes and shots.<br />The extra features are amazing. Being able to cut the tango sequence with the multi-angle view while it was streaming on the screen was amazing and seeing the extended version of the dances was great. Watching the backstage interaction between Kidman and McGregor was amazing and also made you realize how much effort they had really put into this and how normal these two people really are. The dance rehearsals really let you see how the dances developed, however I found there were some dances that Kidman had practiced in rehearsals but never made it to the screen and also weren't included in the extras. Kind of disappointed that they showed us glimpses and didn't let us have the rest. There is no doubt that Kidman certainly has a natural grace.<br />I wish they would've put more interview time with the stars into the 2nd disc, and they included some stuff twice, but it was still great to get this glimpse of their thoughts. I loved that they included recording studio clips while the actors were having fun playing around and rehearsing.<br />I was grateful they did edit out the version of &quot;Come What May&quot; they originally had, and very glad they changed the &quot;Dance across the sky/Your Song&quot; sequence because they detracted greatly to the feeling that the final sequences had. But it's still fun to see what they were originally planning and then going &quot;Thank God they didn't use that.&quot;<br />Having the Coup d'Etat dance sequence just reminded me that there was no Coup d'Etat on either of the two soundtracks, but that's for another review. This was in fact one of my favorite pieces of the movie because of the depth of emotion starting on Satine's first warbling breathy &quot;Never knew...&quot; till the very end when the curtains finally fall. However, it was still great to see this extended version.<br />The Music videos were pretty good, but I expected them to include Elephant Love Medley and an extended Come What May video... Instead they stuck a video of the Come What May Josh Abrams Remix which essentially ruins the track considering it's supposed to be slow and watching the speed up the tape too is just a little wierd because they are the same shots but at a different speed. Watching the &quot;Musical Journey&quot; interview makes you entirely grateful that they finally choose the splattering of 10 or so songs for the Medley than the 2 they had originally.<br />I have to say, I loved the photo gallery in the Marketing section of the 2nd disc. There are some candid shots, but most are from the actual shots and the quality and clarity of these pictures are amazing. The &quot;Little Red Book&quot; is also a very good guide and I highly recommend &quot;flipping&quot; through that.<br />Allin all this is an extremely loaded DVD even if it is a little disappointing at some points such as commentary as to why things were cut and as to a few more extras. Anyways, I would recommend this like no other DVD. There haven't been a lot of directors who've utilized the DVD, and I love that Luhrman knows his market enough to admit that the DVD is an amazing tool that he very well plans to take advantage of. And to his credit, he does take advantage of it. The setup for the menus are awesome. Watch the movie, love it, then buy the DVD for all the goodies as well as quality. No doubt this is a great buy.<br />One final comment I have on this movie, is that no matter how many times I've seen it (no doubt somewhere in the thousands by now), it is a true testament to Baz Luhrman's directing that I always expect the movie to end differently. I know how the end will happen, but every single time I get towards the end of the movie I forget this is a tragedy and find myself caught up in the happiness. And that in itself is a sign of an excellently directed film.  It's a shame Luhrman didn't even get a nomination for the Academy Awards.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This is an excellent addition to your Britney Spears collection, inlcude all the hits! Including Slave, Oops, and Crazy!!! a Definite buy!!!
B000006OS2|3.0|I have to say I was very disappointed that this was the pirated version of &quot;McLintock&quot; and not the original, that was used for the DVD release.  This is my favorite John Wayne movie.  It is so obvious that scenes and lines are missing.  I wish they would have used the legal copy, it would have been much better.  With that said....&quot;McLintock&quot; is a hilarious look into a rich cattleman's life.  Maureen O'Hara plays his wife and she is perfect.  When I was younger, I always wanted to be like Mrs. McLintock, so brave and strong.  Patrick Wayne is wonderful as a hired hand.  There is a fight scene at a clay pit, that will have you rolling on the floor, laughing.  The line by John Wayne, &quot;I'm not going to hit you, I'm not going to hit you, the He** I'm not!&quot;, it's perfect.  There are two scenes with spanking involving grown women that you just have to see to believe.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I hate that I didn't see this film in the theatre...but I've made up for it by first renting the video and watching it twice, then purchasing the DVD and both CDs.  I'm listening to 'Spectacular Spectacular' right now.  There are so many great songs on this CD...but get vol. 2 to complete the picture.  There's a great remix of Kidman singing 'One Day I'll Fly Away' on that one.  Favourite songs include 'Like a Virgin', 'Roxanne', 'Come What May', and the wonderful 'Elephant' medeley.  Hear the music and you will be able to experience this groundbreaking film again and again.
0887307280|5.0|For years, I tried to run a small and make it succesful, until I read this book and began aplying some ot the concepts that Mr. Gerber gives.  You should read it and try it to, I tell you that this book will change the way you think about running a small business and most likely, will change your life.
B00005R2BG|5.0|baz luhrman is a true artistic genius and this is a glimpse into his inner world. A vibrant menagerie of truth, freedom, beauty, and love, Moulin Rouge with have you laughing one minute and crying the next. The storyline is old -fashioned but in this film sparkles with modern music and twists and pure irrelevancy that brightens the soul. Watch it over and over and still find new reasons to cherish it.
B000063UR2|5.0|For those that do not know, this current release is a directors cut with almost 30 minutes of NEVER seen material, not in the US release or the European release. It has the Goldsmith score, and I will go out on a limb and say I am not a big fan of it. I think the TD score was much more haunting and gave us an atmosphere of mystery and darkness than JG's did but I'm not going to complain too loudly because we FINALLY get to see a much fuller version of the story than has ever been shown before!<br />For TD fans there is also the US relelase version in this set with a seperate music track of of TD's haunting and deliciously dark score!!!<BR>So buy it already!!!!
157270070X|5.0|I have listened to all of Jane Austen's novels in the unabridged audiobook form.  Sense and Sensibility (narrated by Sarah Badel) is my personal favorite. Every character has a wonderfully distinct voice.  The narration is lively and captivating. You will love it!  Pay particular attention to the voice Miss Badel gave to &quot;Robert Ferrars&quot;....it's hilarious!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Okay.  Yes, this is cheesy.  Yes it is often times reminiscent of Motley Crue, Abba, and Chumbawumba (often all at once).  And yes it seems like this could be a joke.  Get over it.  Put away your prejudices against anything that isn't ironic or laid back or indie or whatever.  Simply put, this album rocks harder than anything since \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\"  <br />Andrew WK has been greatly hyped, and people are calling him the Savior of Rock n' Roll.  Obviously, that's not the case, but he has made an infectious album that doesn't sound like anything out there today.  These are perfectly constructed pop songs, played as hard rock anthems.  Okay, so the lyrical message isn't Shakespeare, but so what?  Who doesn't want to party hard?  Once you strip down the music and get rid of your biases, what you have here is an album that works b/c it is a pure rock album, and you can't deny it.<br />Listen to \\"She is Beautiful\\" and I dare you not to grin when the \\"I ain't got nothing to lose\\" section hits.  Listen to \\"Party Hard\\" and I dare you not to be headbanging by the song's end.  Listen to \\"Ready to Die\\" and I dare you not to shout out \\"f@$k yeah!\\" as the second verse builds to the chorus.  <br />I'm sorry this review has such an defensive tone, but it makes me angry when people dismiss it just because it 'looks' silly.  There are good things in every genre, and this is the best hard rock album you'll hear this year.
0792846710|5.0|To properly review this movie, I'll look at three different aspects of the film, a formula needed for any Grade-B horror movie.  First though, let's take a look at the not-so-necassary aspect: the plot.  Large (for the most part) Killer Klowns have landed on earth, hungry for some human blood.  They wrap some people up in cacoons, suck the life out of them, and it's up to the heroes to stop them.<br />HORROR FACTOR:  Maybe creepy is a better word than scary.  The movie's whole wild, colorful fun house atmosphere gives this film a real surreal quality that clutches onto your queesy bone.  Kindof like a Marilyn Manson album before he went all \\"Antichrist with a Mission\\".<br />CHEESE FACTOR:  The thing about KKFOS is that it makes fun of other Grade B movies, and it takes pride in it's own cheesiness.  Not hilariously funny, but definitely entertaining from start to finish.<br />THE MONSTERS:  Wow.  This is the best part of the whole movie, and the main reason I liked it so much.  The Klowns look absolutely terrific.  These guys really went the whole hog in the makeup department.  Also I love the enormous Klown-zilla that reared it's big grinning head at the end.<br />In conclusion, Killer Klowns From Outer Space is a true classic, campier than heck but very impressive in the special effects/creature department.  If \\"It\\" scared the bejeebies out of you and \\"Mars Attacks\\" had you rolling on the ground, give this a try.  If not, pick it up anyway!
B000001Y16|5.0|I am usually a metalhead. I used to think the only rappers that had something intersting to say were the old school rappers like &quot;Public Enemy&quot;, &quot;2 Live Crew&quot;, &quot;Notorious B.I.G&quot;, (eaily) &quot;Nas&quot; ect. It is just that I think the same about 2-pac as alot of people do. He really has created the best of the genre. All the CDs are gangsta rap landmarks, and his is lyrics are very profound. This is the first disk I have bought by 2 pac, but it will not be my last.
B00005JKYS|4.0|were created when the partnership of Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace brought General Harold Moore's, \\"We Were Soldiers Once, and Young\\" to the screen. Seeking to portray the vast majority of American soldiers, those who believed wholeheartedly in the early days of the conflict (1965), Moore's viewpoint is in contrast to so many other Nam movies which portray the soldiers' despair after staying \\"in country\\" for months, and falling prey to the brutality, drugs and hopelessness of their surroundings.<br />Moore & Wallace convey one of the best portraits of military wives ever brought to the screen, and perhaps focus on the women affected by Nam more than any film since Jane Fonda was featured in \\"Coming Home\\".<br />I think there may have been better choices to portray Moore than Gibson. He is larger than life in battle, but, for some reason, awkward in portraying his premonitions and uncharacteristically wooden as a father. Gibson, however, will draw audiences to the film, and thus, the reception the film gets will be widespread - and it needs to be seen.<br />Settings and music are brilliant, and the battle scenes, although perhaps too graphic, are vivid and realistic. Of particular note for their intensity are the shots of the North Vietnamese soldiers, silently approaching the American bunkers in incredible numbers, when the GI's call for \\"illumination\\". It is clear how the superior air cover of the US succeeded in allowing an outnumbered and outflanked force to defeat a much larger and entrenched enemy in this battle. The shots of chopper after chopper departing with the dead and wounded, and the appalling odds that the field medics were up against will leave you in sorrow. The North Vietnamese commander, however, expresses himself with a great premonition \\"... it is too bad the Americans have won the battle, for the outcome is destined, and the results of this battle will just make the outcome stretch out in a longer and more bloody fashion\\"....and it came to pass.<br />Supporting players are adequate - Greg Kinnear shines in his role as a chopper pilot, Keri Russell is surprisingly believable as the wife of a young soldier, although the soldier, played by Chris Klein, is wooden in his role. Barry Pepper is outstanding as reporter Joseph Galloway, a noncombatant on the front lines who finds himself having to defend in the battle. I am usually a fan of Sam Elliott, but he is a little too much of a caricature in this picture. Lastly, the beautiful role given to the once-luminous Madeleine Stowe is wasted. Although she is enough of an actress to have played this well at one time, it would seem that someone who is more of a leader of women should have been cast (Maura Tierney, Mary Steenburgen?). Frankly, Stowe has apparently allowed herself to be the victim of a very bad collagen procedure on her lips, and the destruction this has played on her once beautiful face allows the viewer to focus on only this and wonder ---\\"What was she thinking?\\"<br />The finale of the film is touching, and does a good job wrapping up what is certainly the first important film of 2002.<br />Go see it, but be warned about the violence!r />Supporting players are adequate - Greg Kinnear shines in his role as a chopper pilot, Keri Russell is surprisingly believable as the wife of a young soldier, although the soldier, played by Chris Klein, is wooden in his role.

B00000DHRX|4.0|If you love George Michael, then you will love this collection of his hits.  I was a little disappointed that the \\"I want your sex\\" song was not the version I had hoped it would be.  This one is the slower one which I didn't too much care for.  But there were plenty other songs that I liked so I was able to look passed this little change.
B0000630BT|5.0|This, along with Defenders, is my favorite Priest album.  Others prefer Screaming for Vengeance (great), British Steel (very good).  The thing that I like about Painkiller is that all songs are aggressive and heavy, and there are no commercial tracks like Living After Midnight or Another Thing Coming.  I own all of Priest CDs except Demolition and they are all worth buying, even Rocka Rolla.  The worst of Priest is in fact a lot better than the average rock we hear on radio or MTV.  And this is the Best of Priest.  One more thing, the bonus tracks Living Bad Dreams and Leather Rebel (live)are among the best of the remasters, along with Thunder Road, and Race With The Devil.
B00004SPYK|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I believe Paul Scrader is the greatest screen writer of all time. Why? Simply bacuase no other filmmaker has expressed the human truth of man's existence so well. No, he is no expert on women - but he does know men. <br />THE BAD - American Gigolo's plot nowadays plays like a porn plot unfortunately. So, it hasn't aged well. The character of Detective Sunday for instance, is distractingly artificial. I believe unintentionally so. The costume design is exquisite for Gere, but ridiculous for the detective. Additionally, the film has been somewhat unimaginatively directed by Schrader, considering it against some of his other masterful efforts. Take the ludicrous love scene with Gere/Hutton, clearly a failed homage piece. <br />THE GOOD - The film has an incredible sensibility about it. A very cool edge, in many respects. The performance of Gere is still today a landmark for him. Not as successful as its forebearers, but still a fascinating study of a man dealing with artificial relationships - he struggles with his homosexuality (Schrader delved into the gay underworld at this time, without actually being gay). Ultimately, it is the intimacy of love with Michelle, that allows Julian Kaye to find peace. To explore the gay subtext perhaps read Peter Biskind's \\"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\\".<br />FINALLY - please consider this film alongside its Schrader counterparts. The Amazon review is INCORRECT in fact, this is not part of a trilogy, it is part of a tetralogy, as said by Schrader in a Film Comment interview.

B000063CPL|3.0|The thing I didn't like was the song selection.  For example, I just don't consider The Clansman, or Bloodbrothers to deserve inclusion.  Also, instead of The Sign Of The Cross they could have inserted two better songs.  I don't know why Maiden always fails to include more songs from Somewhere In Time (Stranger in A Strange Land, Wasted Years, Alexander the Great)and Seventh Son (Moonchild,Seventh Son)
B000002KLP|5.0|1999, Purple Rain, Around The World In A Day, Sign 'O' The Times, and Diamonds And Pearls are among the essential albums of Prince's career, but none of that would have come to be if it hadn't been for his top-notch third album, Dirty Mind.  If he hadn't made this album, he would've gone on as a second-rate Stevie Wonder or Rick James and that would mean no Purple Rain movie, no psychedelic pop genre album of Around The World In A Day, no Batman soundtrack, etc.<br />The title track sets the pace with its funky pulsing beat and  synthesizer.  The pace picks up with \\"When You Were Mine\\" a post-relationship evaluation.  Prince was an easygoing guy in this relationship and as a result, the one who got the shaft.  He does criticize her in that she \\"didn't have the decency to change the sheets\\" and even invited the guy she was fooling around with, who was \\"sleeping inbetween the two of us.\\"  At the end, he spends his time \\"following him whenever he's with you.\\"  The poor guy!  Cyndi Lauper covered this on She's So Unusual, and I have to favour the original version.<br />\\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" is a sad number about a guy who's not only lost his girl but has no money because he spent it on \\"the longest phone call\\" trying to get her back.  Vintage Prince heartbreak song.<br />Things get funky again with the danceable \\"Uptown\\" where he turns down a pass from a girl who accuses him of being gay.  He quickly turns the tables by saying, \\"No, are you?\\" and lists her as a \\"mixed up victim of society.\\"  Uptown is a place where one can set one's mind free by getting down.<br />\\"Head\\" and \\"Sister\\" would make Tipper Gore's hair stand on end.  The first is about oral sex, with Lisa Coleman sharing vocal duties.  Never mind that the girl in the song is a virgin on her way to the altar.  Morning, noon, and night, huh?  Okay.  It's still maintains its funk beat.<br />The second is an adrenalized burst of a song about (gasp!) incest.  It lasts less than a minute but it tells how the protagonist got sexually initiated.  And Prince waited till his next album to call it Controversy?  THIS is where the controversy started.<br />The anti-war rant \\"Partyup\\" makes this one of my favourites.  Given a choice between a party or a war, even an introverted shrinking violet like me would choose the party.  The final chant goes \\"You're gonna hafta fight your own d--n war/'Cause we don't wanna fight no more!\\"  Prince and company, you tell those boys at the Pentagon!<br />This was one of the first albums to carry a warning label given the subject matter.  The trouble was, that scared potential buyers.  And what about the picture of him reclining on a sofa, wearing long coat, bikini briefs, and leg-warmers, with the painted song titles on the wall behind him?  It went gold upon its initial release.  It's probably gone multi-platinum by now<br />Dirty Mind also introduced Prince fans to keyboardist Lisa Coleman, who came out in Purple Rain and later teamed up with guitarist Wendy Melvoin for three albums.  This was also the last album with Andre Cymone, Prince's childhood friend, whose influence was being lessened as Prince concentrated power around himself.<br />This is the most crucial and pivotal album in Prince's career and although it only has eight songs, is essential for students of the Purple One.rotagonist got sexually initiated.

0671042858|5.0|When you say Stephen King you think GENIUS. This is one of his best books yet! It was recomended to me by my english teacher who knows I love suspence. It's an exiting book about a brave little girl who gets lost in the woods because she needed to pee. She has hope of getting out of there always turning to her idol (Tom Gordon) for that extra push. But besides being lost in the woods by herself, all alone, without any contact with human kind exept a [bad] walkman, something is following her. I recomend this book to anyone who likes baseball and suspence, you wont regret reading it. 14/f/FL

0465011012|4.0|This isn't literature on the scale of \\"The Gulag Archipelago,\\" and there are some misspellings, but so what?  It's a highly accessible and moving account of one person's experiences in the North Korean prison camp system and his escape.  It is hard for me to imagine a reader who reading this book would not learn something about North Korea or the human spirit.  Bravo to the authors for putting out this memoir.
B000005JA8|5.0|Trout Mask Replica is one of those sublime masterpieces of a record that only comes along every once in an eon or so.  Like Thelonius Monk before him, many of the Captain's songs sound like untrained, unrestricted romps of unmusicianship with very little skill, but there is an incredible amount of great musicianship that goes into every note of music on this album.  Things that are heard here in many cases wouldn't even occur to someone who only has rudimentiary knowledge of music, and that is only one of the things that makes this album so challenging for the listener to appreciate about it.  As a musician, I find the music incredibly moving on many levels.  From the opening track of &quot;Frownland,&quot; which changes up time signatures more than most people change their socks to the bluesy-psychedelic romps of &quot;Moonlight In Vermont&quot; and &quot;Dachau Blues&quot; this album has everything, from spazzed out free jazz to bizarre fractured poetry.  The players all seem to be duking it out through the course of this mammoth album in an &quot;every man for himself&quot; type of scenario, but it's all so fascinating, and with the Captain's incredibly volatile voice on top, its even more entertaining.  I really can't say enough good things about this record.  I've had a copy since '96, and its one that I continue to find new things about every time I listen to it.  It's one of those albums that I wish now that I'd never had heard, so I can re-discover it all over again.  If you don't at least try to appreciate Beefheart's genius, you'll have only yourself to blame, my friend.
0671027379|4.0|I picked up this book after finishing \\"Angels and Daemons\\" and was looking forward to another thriller that would keep me reading until the early hours of the morning.  Well, that's what I got with \\"Deception Point\\"!<br />When I first started reading this book, I was a bit afraid that the plot was just to out there for my liking, well by the middle of the book a 180-degree plot twist made me more interested in this fun book.<br />This was an easy read that was a great book for those times where you do not want to have to think that much about the plot.  I think that this book would make an excellent movie and that the characters were well developed and the plot was fascinating.<br />All in all I would highly recommend this book!
0671004611|5.0|I do believe after the first test explosion of a nuke in the desert that our planet and civilization became something of interest to beings not of this earth.  I also firmly believe a craft crashed in Roswell.  This book is the first one I have read that contains what I really believe to be the facts surrounding the crash, told from the first person point of view by the man who was responsible for distributing debris  from the crash for reverse engineering by various companies.  ...  I recommend everyone read this book who wants to know the facts behind the Roswell aftermath.
6300215717|5.0|I watched this film blind to the plot.  It was very moving and completely enjoyable.  I'd recommend this to people who love classics and even to those who don't.  It leaves you with a warm feeling.  It's cute, funny and a must see.  Forgetting that it is in black and white is amazingly easy.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore definantly deserved the Oscar for best original score.<BR>All the songs are wonderfully composed, make great use of choirs (in English, Elvish and Dwarvish!), and have a diverse range, from the beauty of 'Many Meetings' to the building suspense in 'The Bridge of Khazad Dum',  from the joy of 'Concerning Hobbits' to the heroic fanfare of 'The Ring goes South'. Most importanly, the music fit in perfectly with every scene.<BR>The best music soundtrack I have, even better then Gladiator and Braveheart!
B0000634EV|3.0|So this is the new Down record.  After a lengthy wait, we the fans are  finally rewarded with a CD with some pretty decent cuts.  To put it bluntly, this record has about 1/3 of the impact that &quot;Nola&quot; had.  It is apparent that the band just went in there and had fun recording the songs.  The jams are really loose and they groove.  Where it fails, however, is bringing that undeniable heaviness that &quot;Nola&quot; had.  Phil sang with a lot more soul (for lack of a better word) on the first record.  The guitar riffs seem to have taken a backseat this time around, as they are vaguely memorable after repeated listenings.  That's not to say there aren't any good tunes here, because there are.  &quot;Stained Glass Cross&quot; is an obscenely catchy song that really brings a new dimension to the band (just listen to that organ!).  One song that comes close to recapturing what the band was doing back in 1995 is &quot;The Seed&quot;.  It opens with a band member saying &quot;Power of the riff compels me!&quot;  It sure does, this song has the best guitar work on the entire CD.  A completely memorable song with chorus riff that really projects a swaying sense movement.  &quot;Ghosts Along the Mississippi&quot; also has that &quot;Nola&quot; vibe, but it lacks the all important riff.  Overall, if you like Down, you'll probably like some of the songs on &quot;II&quot;. Those of the Brotherhood of Eternal Sleep who praise &quot;Nola&quot; like a deity will more than likely be disappointed, but give it a chance.  (3 1/2 Stars)

B00000JG41|5.0|OK. I've been a fan of Mike Patton's work for the last 11 years, and, although I didn't think that it would have been possible, the boy keeps getting better and better.<BR>I honestly can't say which of his projects has been the best, since they are all so incredibly unique. However, suffice to say that &quot;California&quot; is a must for your music collection. Yeah, if you're not use to anything with a little ingenuity or doesn't sound like every other thing out there, you probably won't like it at first. Trust me, once you're hooked, you're not only a Bungle fan, but you're also a Patton fan for life. <BR>Why is &quot;California&quot; so intrinsic to your musical well-being?<br />Because I said so.<br />Just get it, listen to the tracks and the lyrics. You'll love &quot;Pink Cigarette,&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; and &quot;Air-Conditioned Nightmare.&quot; They're all great.<br />Then, go get Faith No More, all other Bungles, Tomahawk, Fantomas, Lovage, his solos, and whatever he comes out with next. It will be gold. I promise. I'm 22, and I still can't get enough.
6305744742|4.0|In the first adaption to the big screen of the classic comic strip The Addams Family director Barry Sonnefield do right.<br />First the actors very capable and professional.<br />The fx,costumes and adaptation are also right.<br />A great movie.
B00003CWSO|5.0|First, it is appalling that this film isn't on DVD in the US.  I had to order it from overseas as it never played in theatres where I live.  In this so called global village, why can't we order the full 170-min. version from Italy??<br />This film is extraordinary in its exploration of the mind of a man whose life circumstances are so different from anyone we might ever know.  Roth is superb in letting us inside his head (and heart) through his body language, facial expressions and, of course, through his music, long before he verbalizes it.  In fact, we get to \\"see\\" the formation of his philosophy as it happens.<br />The relationship between Max and 1900 is a solid foundation for the film, which should have gotten every editing award on the globe for the sequence of the piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton.  The film's look is wonderful except for a truly tacky plastic model of the ship Virginian.  But the dockside scenes are great and are beside a ship that looks the right vintage.  Every actor, including the extras, is just right.  The ship's interiors are wonderful, and so is the interior of the pawnshop.  <br />I do think this film has made me reflect on the way I view life, thanks to 1900's insights.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Not being the most prolific releaser of albums it was a bit of hearsay and a glimpse of the video to Is it a crime that convinced me that Sade had another album. Being a long time fan of Sade it wasn't too hard to get me to spend my money and I certainly wasn't disapointed. My wife fights me for this CD as both of us are taking it to work with us. It is pointless highlighting the many classics that are on there or pining for what isn't as there is more than enough material to satisfy everyone. The musicianship is what one comes to expect with Sade, and Sade, Mr. Matthewamn et al certainly don't disapoint. <br />It is great that an artist can get out there and perform to a crowd and get them totally engrossed. You know the songs and how they sound but how will she perform them? Well with a great deal of aplomb and a very welcome addition to my ever expanding CD collection. However, few get the special status that this CD does. There are five star albums and five star performers Sade and band give us both.
B000002G7E|5.0|So scary it hurts. One of the best production jobs every on a record (no sarcarsm), in the sense that the super-rough values augumented the power of the songs immeasurably. Ask yourself, would &quot;Sister Ray&quot; be the masterpiece it is if it was produced like Sgt. Peppers? I think not. I'll be the first to admit, I hated this album when I first got it, but it really does become like a lovable wayward friend, giving you release or anger or joy whenver you need it. This is the album I listened to for 3 months after my divorce, and it made me a happier man. To all the detractors of this records: pull your head out of the ground, throw all your musical pretensions out the window, and learn to love this album like I did, because it will reward you.
B00005QK3W|1.0|I have been really disappointed with McCartney since the mid-eighties. I don't think he has put out an album worth his salt since \\"McCartney 2\\". This album is no different. \\"Freedom\\" really is a flop. Of all the things that McCartney has written in the past, all those great lyrics. It is a sad state of affair when all he can come up with for such a traumatic event is \\"Freedom\\". Anyone can see that he took no time at all to create this song, I'd estimate 20 minutes tops.<BR>If John Lennon were still alive he'd really be giving it to Paul on this one. I can hear it now, \\"Why doesn't he stick with the silly love songs? He does those pretty well.\\"<BR>I haven't bought a McCartney album in years and now I know why. I just don't think that he is trying anymore.

B0000634EV|3.0|I'll just start out this review by saying that n.o.l.a. is probably my favorite album of all time, along with koRn's 1st album and bloody kisses.  I had a feeling DOWN's new record would be a bit dissapointing and for the most part, I was right.  Of course it would be nearly impossible to make a record that sounded as good as nola did.  For the most part DOWN II is a shadow of what nola was.  There's only a few songs on this album that could hold their own against nola.  The high points of the album are \\"Theres Something One My Side\\", \\"Ghost Along the Mississippi\\", \\"Where I'm Going\\", \\"New Orleans is a Dying Whore\\", \\"The Seed\\", and \\"Landing on the Mountains of Meggido\\".  As for the rest of the album, its best described as southern blues rock, which is decent to chill to, but i think DOWN could do a hellava lot better.  Real DOWN is \\"Bury Me in Smoke\\", \\"Rebab\\", \\"Jail\\", etc.  You won't find anything like that on this record.  Overall the album isn't very heavy at all, and Phil rarely screams.  On a positive note however, this is an important record to remind us of what \\"real rock\\" is, when bands like Linkin Park are dominating the charts, which is very sad.  Give DOWN credit for putting out an original piece of work.  But overall, after listening to nola over 50,000 times, DOWN II pales in comparison.
B00005A1PR|4.0|in a stroke of unprecidented justice, india.arie made a splash at the 2002 grammys, helping her to achieve widespread recognition for a stunning debut. though india.arie's _accoustic soul_ is not as accoustic as releases by contermporaries cree summer or cherokee nor her vocal acumen on par with, say, jill scott or erykah badu, she does stand apart from the crowd as a neo-soul earth mother, the likes of which has not been seen since des'ree or ambersunshower. india.arie is definitely in possession of one very old soul and an unparalleled musical sensibility. album standouts include the much-touted &quot;video&quot; and &quot;brown skin&quot;, as well as &quot;ready for love&quot; and &quot;i see god in you&quot;.

The characters were well developed and there was enough humor and tear jerking moments to make you want to read it again. I fell in love with the characters. I hope that the movie is just as good.

Zach de la Rocha is the lead singer for Rage and his amazing rap vocals is what makes this band come alive.

Great songs include Bombtrack, Killing in the Name, Know Your Enemy, and Freedom. With creative lyrics and great definition to the band, Rage Against the Machine is one great rock band that everyone should know about.

3931141802|5.0|Like an elusive text in search of itself, Robert Frank's 1958 book The Americans has changed format each of the four times it's changed publishers. From the text heavy French version to the oversized aperture reprint, Frank has continued to refine his work each time it appears in print.<br />In the Scalo version, the place-name captions have been removed from the pages opposite the photographs and collected in the back of the book. Forget any ideas you might have of Frank's book being a travelogue. In place of the itinerary, the Scalo edition finally establishes the ORDER of the book's photographs as the crucial ingredient in Frank's complex vision of America. The 83-photograph sequence cuts between elliptical narrative of the open road and comparative sociology of dead-end lives as Frank turns free association into inescapable logic and then back again. The result is the most masterful combination of photographs in book form.<br />The subjects of Frank's photographs roam this fractured typology like prophets locked in an unstable time loop. Geography no longer takes center stage as the formative element of their photographic selves. In some small but significant way, the americans in the Scalo edition reclaim the intentionality of their sadness, anger, and alienation. The bitter and often unwilling nature of their engagements with Frank take center stage, each as profound an act of refusal as Frank's own denunciation of the pasteboard optimism of '50s America.
B000060MMI|5.0|I caught my first and only Flogging Molly show when they played San Diego on St. Patty's Day.  That show, I can honestly say, is one of the top 3 or so that I've ever been to.  And while it is difficult to re-create the energy and guinness guzzling, sing-along good times of the live show, the album shines in every other way.  Without boring anybody with technicalities and stereotypical comparisons, I will simply state that this band rocks like very few do and has a style and originality to call its own.  And anybody who says they don't like irish punker drinking music is a  liar.  Great band.  Great album.  Good times.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has come a long way since Opiate. From Undertow, they showed what they could do. From Aenima, they showed what the could prove. Now, from their 4th album Lateralus, they showed something new. Tool has done it again with new guitar riffs, different beats, and still....the amazing vocals. The album starts out with The Grudge. Long song for an intro but you just have to listen to it. Eon Blue Apocalypse is a nice intermission to set off the begining of The Patient, which is a nice song. Mantra gives you the feeling that your alone and waiting for soemthing unexpected to happen. Schism (first one to hit on the radio) is a great song with a good guitar riff. Parabol and Parabola are both joined together. Parabol is slow and moving but then sets you off to a more higher alternative level, Parabola. Both are great. Ticks &amp; Leeches is the hardest song to listen to. With Maynard's screaming and dark vocals makes this an interesting song to listen to. Lateralis is also a long song, but its the best one on the album (just think of it as a new AENIMA). Disposition is a nice song that sends you a message....&quot;Calm down for a while&quot;. Reflection is the longest song on the album but its good enough to think of it as a another begining. Triad and Faaip De Oiad are the last songs of the album, and both are very interesting and creative. Lateralis is one kick a%# album. This is a definite album for all fans of Tool.
B000002KB8|5.0|While this isn't Sabbaths most 'accomplished' record, it is however their most seeped in the blues. That bothers some fans, but like Led Zeppelin's first album I enjoy it very much. A great deal of hard rock comes from the blues, and it's unfortunate that Sabbath (as well as Zeppelin) never really explored it further after their respective debuts. This is the Sabbath record that I always come back to after I've tired of the rest.
B0000634EV|5.0|Most listeners would agree that Down's other CD, Nola, is spectacular. With this release, Down perfects each and every aspect that makes their music so damn good.<br />Whether the song is hard and heavy like \\"New Orleans...\\" or slow like \\"...Meggido\\", the emotion of the music pulls you in. Creating the album in 28 days in the middle of the Louisiana sticks couldn't have been better to influence the music.<br />Good, hard, old-school, southern metal. It doesn't get any better than that!
6300214559|5.0|Although in \\"real life\\" Guillford and Jane didnt get along, this is a wonderful story irregardless. And besides that, it has great historical information.<BR>I thought that it was a beautiful love story and it makes you wonder if both Janes and Guilffords parents werent so power-hungry, they might have fallen in love the way they did in this movie.<BR>Helen Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes shines in this movie!!!!<BR>I have loved this movie for many many years since I was around 15 and Im going to be 30 next month!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000634EV|4.0|After reading the interviews and articles I was maybe a bit too excited. This is a very good cd, but not the greatness I was expecting. Fans of the first Down record rejoice, this one top to bottom is better. Unfortunately there is no song as good as &quot;Lifer&quot; was on the first one. There are no bad songs, and some very good ones. 'Stained Glass Cross', 'The Man the Follows Hell', &quot;Learn From this Mistake' and are early favorites. <BR>There is a nice balance of heavy riffing and quiter moments. They use a hammond organ and accoustic guitars on a few songs. You can hear the Sabbath and Zeppelin influences, but there is also a lot of blues and Southern Rock creeping in as well.<BR>You can hear influences from all of the band members involved. The swamp boogie of COC, the thick sludgy riffs of Crowbar and Eyehategod, and of course the power groove of Pantera. Fans of these bands will find soemthing they like. This is truly one of those CD's that gets better with each listen. Overall a good effort, just not the greatness I had hoped for.

B0000634EV|5.0|By far the best cd of 2002 so far!! THIS IS A GREAT ROCK CD!!  With members from Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar, and Eyehategod.  This is not as heavy as their first cd NOLA but I like this cd a lot better,  it's more rock than heavy metal.  It has a southern, Black Sabbath, rock sound to it.  My favorite song is probably Stained Glass Cross. Like I said, THIS IS A GREAT ROCK CD!!

They are, basically, the ones to blame for the lame sound and atmosphere on this record, who had enormous potential, since the songs are basically all very good. This was also Jake E. Lee farewell.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This legendary album contains a mix of punk, rock, ska, reggae, pop, rockabilly, jazz and blues. Known as: &quot;The Only Band That Matters&quot;, The Clash made history with the 1979 release of &quot;London Calling&quot;. This album is rated as one of the greatest 100 rock albums ever recorded (according to V.H.1. Music) It's fame and acclaim is held right up there with the Beatles &quot;Sergeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;...(please excuse any misspelling).As mentioned in previous previews there's something for everybody on this two-album CD. With London Calling's music there is never a dull moment. This album by The Clash rocks with every fiber of its being. You dont have to be a Clash/Joe Strummer fan like me to get into it.  Once youve got it in your CD player you'll never wanna take it out...Unless of course you've just purchased Joe Strummer's new album: &quot;Global A Go-Go&quot;.Need I say more?
B00003CXBK|5.0|An anime must-see... As an on-and-off anime watcher, I found this to be the one movie that's got me waiting for the next great anime movie. The animation and often comical characters of Toki, Koroku, and others make it easy for a young kid to watch; thematic elements dealing with the conflict between man and nature allow an older audience to enjoy.  The scenery is beautifully done, but I suggest that, if you get this DVD, to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles, and even then you don't get the full beauty of the language used.  Some of the subtitles are slightly inaccurate (as far as my limited Japanese language skills can tell), but even if you watch it in English it is still a wonderful film.
B00005QIPH|2.0|another example of posturing music 'editors' who cream themselves over anything that sounds remotely like Velvet Underground.
B000002B7Y|3.0|Ozzy achieve that rare status of supremacy, where every single song he (and his partners) write are right on the mark. The trouble here are not the songs. It's the production. It still sounds similar to the awful glam of THE ULTIMATE SIN. That's the real trouble here. The drums sound is bad, lifeless. Zakk is good, but still clearly founding his way into the band. Wizzar rent-a-bassist Bob Daisley apparently was fired after the recording. As for the songs, they're good. Ha, the bonus track is a song called \\"HERO\\", ok? See ya!
0871137380|5.0|I am thirteen and I started reading this book because it was the first one I saw and because I was grounded. I finished the book in two weeks, while at school and at home. This is the first book I have ever read about The Battle of the Black Sea and I got very interested. Out of all the books I have ever read, this is the most suspenseful and hooking book of all. I would suggest this book to anyone who has time to sit down for hours to read. I am trying to find a book now that will be as good as Black Hawk Down, but I dont know if it's possible!
0553274503|4.0|Flowers For Algernon by Daniel Keyes is a science-fiction novel based on the consequences of the defiance of nature. In the story, Keyes depicts a mentally handicapped man whose intelligence level begins to surpass his emotional level. As science gives him a second chance toward intelligence, this leaves him to struggle through the burdens of new emotions that he is incapable of dealing with.<br /> The main character of this novel is Charlie Gordon, a mentally challenged 32-year-old man who works in a bakery. This novel is told through Charlie's perspective in his progress reports. Studying at Beekman College, Charlie becomes the prime candidate that is recommended for the brain experiment being run by Professor Nemur and Professor Strauss at the college. Originally with an IQ of 68, the surgery that Charlie undergoes almost triples his level of intelligence. Along with the intelligence, came the realization of the way things really were around him. As he becomes smarter, Charlie begins to see that those whom he had considered his friends, had been teasing and ridiculing him all along. Although he becomes far more intelligent than those who are considered mentally superior, Charlie is still at the emotional level of a child. As he struggles through the reality of the pain and rejection that his life is filled with, Charlie sees that his past ignorance had allowed him to be a much happier man.<br /> In regards to my personal interest, I found Flowers For Algernon fairly interesting. Although it was a science-fiction novel, the scientific aspects of the book were very believable in terms of their theories and terminology. Compiled of Charlie's progress reports (which are similar to journal entries), the story is very straightforward in the beginning, but starts to become more complex as Charlie becomes increasingly intellectual. The author manages to hold a reader's attention throughout the novel with the varied emotions that Charlie experiences, as the reader sympathizes toward his situation. This novel is very emotional because it accurately depicts the cruel extent of society toward mentally handicapped individuals; it is very insightful. Flowers For Algernon is definitely worth reading because it describes human nature in ways that one may not have imagined.<br /> An aspect of the novel that I found intriguing, was the question of ethics. As Charlie becomes considerably intelligent, his co-workers at the bakery begin to despise him. They hated the fact that they now looked stupid beside a \\"moron\\" and many felt that it was wrong that Charlie had defied nature. A co-worker told Charlie that it wasn't right to know more than God had intended for him to know; Charlie had challenged God. I found myself agreeing with that statement and the reality that many lack faith in the fact that they are exactly the way that they were meant to be. From a religious point of view, although Charlie had only accepted a second chance for a normal life, perhaps it is wrongful for him to go against nature - an act that is deserving of a penalty. If advances in science allows for a similar type of technology, I would not be supportive of the cause.<br /> Based on Flowers For Algernon, Daniel Keyes is a unique writer. This novel is both reflective of human nature and controversial. Progressing through the story, one is absorbed into Charlie's life and perspective of things. Although others may have different opinions of this novel, I recommend it to teenage or adult readers.
B000003TA4|5.0|THis album, even being played with ferocity by Cobain and his pals Novoselic and Grohl, is almost pop. That's the reason it's so pleasant to listen. I just don't understand the price...
B00005RHGK|1.0|In the first minutes of the film, these two kids drive by a house where they see a spooky looking guy dumping a body down a rusty drainpipe.  Do they go tell the authorities? No! They actually turn around and one of them goes DOWN THE PIPE HIMSELF!  The best part of this movie was the ending, since what happens to this same character will keep him from passing on his truly defective genes.  Unfortunately, the same thing won't happen to the cheese vendors who produced this [awful] movie.
B000063CPL|2.0|The show by IRON MAIDEN in Rock in Rio was really a great event. The band was in top-notch form, except for Janick Gers, as always, who simply does not know how to make a guitar solo!! But, for a MAIDEN fan, what's the point in buying another live album by this band? It's clearly a mutual selling: they are feeding upon the great hype made with the BRAVE NEW WORLD album, when Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith came back. Other than this, Maiden has already so many live albums, that why bother with another one containing the same material??!! (of course, ROCK IN RIO has some songs from the new album... big deal...). Do you doubt me? Check Maiden live albums:<br />* MADE IN JAPAN (EP)<br />* LIVE AFTER DEATH<br />* A REAL LIVE ONE<br />* A REAL DEAD ONE<br />* LIVE AT DONNINGTON
0425180638|5.0|I have read many interviews with Patricia Cornwell, and i get the sense that she is a really likeable, generous, kindhearted person. I like her books, and her, a great deal. <br />This book, whilst perhaps not being the best in terms of \\"intrigue\\" is nonetheless an extremely good entry in the series. It is a very strong and powerful book, which is full of emotion and shimmers with despair, injustice, unfairness, and in the middle of it all is Scarpetta, with Marino and Lucy, who at times seem to be the only people trying to right the wrongs of the world. (A downside to this comes when you get the sense that Scarpetta somehow feels very \\"superior\\" to everyone else.) The sense of loneliness Cornwell portrays is very compelling, and at times very moving. You feel Scarpetta's despair and depression at the terrible things going on in her world. <br />Many people criticise the latest Scarpetta books for being too depressing and dark. But, i ask you, what else do you expect? The main character is a medical examiner who deals in death every single day...Are you expecting picnics by a river, or what? Death is depressing. So, by default, these novels shoudl also be quite depressing. <br />It is also very moving the way that, over the course of the series, we have seen Scarpetta become gradually more and more immersed in her job, more obsessed by it and with justice, and yet with almost every book it brings her a further step down into the pit of depression.  <br />This latest book has a much slower pace than most of her previous novels, which is good. It is good for Scarpetta's life to slow down sometimes, so she has time to get to grips with things. Also, the reader has too. <br />i cannot praise this series highly enough. It has so many levels, so many things which are praiseworthy. It goes from strength to strength, and all the books are different. The characters are great, if sometimes a tad pretentious. But hey, i can live with that, as long as Cornwell continues to write such good books. Her mastery of the English language is unquestionable. She rarely uses much descriptive prose, instead choosing to make her writing to the point and engaging, but when she does, it really gives the writing a shimmering edge. <br />Brilliant, Patricia. Thank you. Ignore the doubters. I cannot wait for Scarpetta 12 (supposed to be the next part in this ongoing \\"Chandonne\\" saga.)
B00005RY7X|4.0|This is fun to listen to, and it can be a great party album. This is about as pure as it gets. Dont let the cover fool you.
B0000584V3|5.0|I really like Opeth, they always manage to surprise me with not only some really creative texture and guitar interplay, but also with their ability to keep crafting songs that while as out there as they can get, still keep my interest and still prove that this awesome band can progress, even though they are always at the top of their game. This is my favorite CD of theirs just because it is such a collection of all the things that makes Opeth such an awesome band, from the brutal to the somber, the simplistic (which they actually have) to the all-out technical, and the demonic to the angellic.
B000001GXI|5.0|Mozart's Zauberfl&ouml;te is an opera that has not lacked for great recordings through the years. This rendition has remained near the top of the list for decades and deservedly so. For one, it is guided by a compelling artistic vision in the person of Karl B&ouml;hm, who draws orchestral playing of the utmost quality from the Berlin Philharmonic--the recording would be worth listening to for that element alone. To that is added a cast, particularly on the male side, that is among the finest ever assembled for the opera. Fritz Wunderlich, one of the saddest stories in classical music of promise left unfulfilled by early death, was fortunately captured at his peak in one of his most congenial roles. It's doubtful that his Tamino will ever be surpassed. Franz Crass offers a dark, firm bass as Sarastro and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings and acts superbly as Papageno, fresh and funny and with practically none of the blustering mannerisms later associated with his name.<br />If there are any small weaknesses they appear in some of the other performances. Evelyn Lear has the right rich timbre for Pamina and sings expressively but is severely taxed by the demands of \\"Ach, ich f&uuml;hl's,\\" her big aria, while Roberta Peters is an accurate but cautious, light-voiced Queen of the Night. Neither the Three Ladies nor Three Spirits (sung by women on this recording, not boys) form ideally well-tuned or -blended vocal ensembles and the Papagena is not up to her one duet with Fischer-Dieskau, the one real disappointment.<br />More subtly, B&ouml;hm emphasizes the solemn gravity of the underlying themes of this opera, peace, love and Masonic brotherhood, and brings this out through magisterial, expansive pacing. It's possible to feel that the knockabout fun of some of the lighter episodes is skimped in the process. Faster tempi might have helped some of the lesser singers as well. Still, on balance, this is a recording that easily maintains its legendary status among available recordings of Mozart's unruly, lovable masterwork.'s unruly, lovable masterwork.
0385334206|5.0|What a fantastic departure from the contemporary fiction I usually read. <BR>Vonnegut's storytelling has no limits or restrictions; he happily runs straight for the edge of human imagination and keeps going.
B000059ZLH|3.0|Watching and listening to Dream Theater for over ten years has given me a good idea of when they are good and when they are not.  The music here is, for the most part, very good as one would expect from DT.  The video is more of a mixed bag.  First of all, the band sounds pretty tight.  As usual they are a lot of fun to watch.  However, the portion with John Petruci soloing over a gospel singer makes me cringe.  It is awful.  Sometimes juxtaposition is a good thing.  It is not in this case.  Secondly, the video itself is an admirable attempt to put vision to sound, yet the quality of the video footage ranges from good to poor.  <br />I realize that DT probably got little to no label support for this project, but some of these shots look far from professional.  I'm speaking of the film footage shot to supplement the story of the album-NOT the footage of the band in concert.  I did find some of the graphics cheesy and repetitive after about ten minutes.  My other complaint has to do with the fact that often, when I would much rather be watching the band play the tune (especially the climax of the last song!) I am stuck watching the dopey film footage.  This is a mixed bag so approach it with caution-even some DT fans have been critical.  This is probably not the best introduction to the band if you are unfamiliar with them.
B00000I3JO|5.0|I dare say that The Blue Nile are one of the most underrated trios in rock. With vocals that just come from somewhere divine and instrumentation to match, they should be the biggest thing out there. But the band refuse to tour for their records because they want privacy and aren't really flattered by live performances. In fact they have given about 20 performances in the 22 years they have been together. The concerts they have given, however, are said to be just magical. Let's hope they come our way during our lifetimes. <BR>    ON another point Blue Nile records come out infrequently because they are: A) Studio Hogs, and B) They have had notorious contract disputes with their label(s). A six year gap between existed &quot;Walk across the Rooftops&quot; and &quot;Hats&quot; because they were in battle after battle with the label. Overall they scrapped more than three different versions of this album before they were satisfied. It was worth the effort.<BR>      This is undeniably their most coherent work. The samples are slight but they do make a difference to set a very subdued tone for the LP. Paul Buchanan's bass work, which is as good as Tim Wright (Pere Ubu, Danse Society, DNA), Rhett Crowe (Guadalcanal Diary), or Sebastian Steinberg (Soul Coughing), doesn't dominate like in &quot;...Rooftops&quot; and that makes it more appealing. Even more so are his vocals. He has the best white voice I have ever heard. He repeats simple phrases and alters them with a kind of intonation that money can't buy and training can't teach.<BR>    Secondly, this album is more mechanical than &quot;rooftops&quot; but it flows better as a whole. (By that same token, &quot;rooftops&quot; has better songs, but the album is weaker.) The mechanization of their sound is also reflected in their lyrics, which talk more and more of people contrasting with machines. The preoccupation with urban life sets a kind of Walt Whitman tone that deepens as a person listens repeatedly. Notice how a jerkyrelationship is compared to traffic lights in &quot;Seven A.M.&quot; and steamboat noises dominate the melody of &quot;Over the Hillside&quot;. <BR>    I regret that this review of the Blue Nile and the album has been vague, but of any band I have ever heard, I have the toughest time putting their sound into words. They are simply beyond music itself. They are a mood. What I can only describe as sounding like a rainy day feels. Perhaps a happier version of Morphine. Nevertheless, this album and its predecessor are to be purchased. If at all possible, try to find the long out of print double album set &quot;From Tinseltown to Downtown&quot; which has both on one CD. Listen to this album when it's raining outside or late at night, and you will see why the best ideas and things can't be communicated.
B0000584V3|4.0|Ive been a big In Flames and Children of Bodom fan for almost two years.  American music is in a downward spiral right now, but Europe is producing the greatest metal I could ever concieve of.  After hearing so much In Flames, I thought I should check out Opeth.  I never really heard much about Opeth until Blackwater Park hit the shelves.  When I heard Blackwater Park for the first time, it struck me as very emotional. I can't describe what makes the music so emotional but it is something to do with the way the melodies are constructed.  I was addicted to the song \\"Bleak\\" for about a week before I got it out of my head.  The melody is so awesome in that song.  This album is very dark/emotional/depressing and you feel like you are walking through a cemetary in the rain.  I think it is really cool how Opeth can create such haunting effects without turning to the hardcore Norwegian style black metal like Dimmu Borgir.  I am not a huge fan of the nordic black metal sound, but I love the Gothenburg sound and anthing from Finland.  This album is tough to get into at times, especially if you know every In Flames song like I do.  It seems like every Opeth fan I meet absolutely loves them right off the bat.  I never really got into them that much but I assume thats because im not too fond of that style of black metal.  This isn't the Jester Race but its up there among some very good Swedish metal albums.
B000002KY8|5.0|This is a great album. It contains 11 tracks and all of them<BR>are great. Fun songs that you can dance to and great production.<BR>This album is a must have for any fan of Music period. If you<BR>dont have it in your collection buy it now because this is probably one of the best albums of the 80s and probably one of the top 40 best albums of all time.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Allright, allright, they are by no means the stooges. I get that. And yes, I'll agree the album is a bit monotonous (maybe more than a bit) and maybe the sound is a little campy. To me it almost seems as though they had a good thing going, a strong, true sound, but they gave it up to put a more marketable swing on it. I'll tell you, every poser-punk fakie-indie-fan seventh grader in the country is going to buy this CD...but does that mean I cant just enjoy it? I'm curious...just because music might lack \\"integrity\\" does that truely make it [stinks]? who [] says I cant like band like the strokes and still be true to my punk/indie loving spirit? Sometimes, man, its just music. Sometimes it just sounds fun. Sometimes I just like to listen to it, not analyze it. Don't get me wrong, I can talk you to death about the deepest depths of the sound of a song, but sometimes I dont choose to.  I like this CD, its fun, its good background music, good for riding in the car...but dont let any of my friends catch me listening, ok?
B00005JKQX|5.0|This has become my very favorite movie.  It reached me on different levels each time I viewed it and each time I was just as moved. <BR>     I know it is a movie about schizophrenia but it can also be related to addictions or obsessions and can help those not afflicted understand to a greater depth and with greater sensitivity those who are.
B00005Y1Y3|5.0|I think this cd has some great music that hasn't been heard in a long time.  If you like this music go to &quot;thedoors.com&quot;.  There are multiple concerts for sale: Detroit, Aquarius, etc. and interview cds.  It appears from these reviews people aren't aware there's a lot more music available (only through The Doors' site).
0684830515|3.0|The characters had depth and the writing was clear, but I think I missed a plot or storyline.  It moved along well, but unless you find a story about a bunch of spoiled post-adolescents tromping around Europe in the 1920's particularly interesting this one may leave you a little hungry.  I already own A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls so sometime down the road I will give those a shot, but for now Hemingway has not impressed me.  I'll take Steinbeck over Hemingway any given day.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I've heard SO many people say that a person will either love or hate &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;  I absolutely hate it.<br />I have nothing against movie musicals (&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; was *really* the best movie of last year), but this barely even qualifies.  The once-contemporary, beat-into-the-ground pop songs just didn't work for me in the turn-of-the-century setting.<br />A complete waste of Ewan McG's talent.<br />And I'm not even going to go into the blasphemy of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; by all those skanky women in the video...  ::shudder:
B00005N9CV|5.0|Perfect!How else could you describe this flawless,inspirig and heavenly trip down nostalgia?<br />The selection of songs are superb and being a huge Diana Krall and Burt Bacharach fan I should say nothing will bring me more joy than to hear her sing my favourite Bacharach tune The Look Of Love.The rest of the songs are equally good and she brings in a breath of fresh air to the Jazz/Pop scene with her signature voice.<br />The engineering in this album is done by the same guy responsible for working with Jobim on Wave and Tide albums so you do not have to worry about how your favourite tunes are going to sound.<br />Whether you want to relax,ejnoy or even have a romantic evening this is the perfect choice.
B00005JKQX|5.0|For the first time, the movie is better than the book! I made sure I saw the movie first... the book was quite boring in parts, way too much mathmatical stuff in it, but many things that you were not made aware of in the movie, such as his wife divorcing him, yet they got back together many years later, and she was always there for him. They remarried after his nobel prize. Russell Crowe should have won best actor, he was OUTSTANDING in this. This movie grips you from beginning to end. One is never quite sure what is real and what is not.... <BR>I loved it.

B00003CXXP|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am not too upset about wasting [money] on the DVD, as the video and sound quality were excellent. I do feel like I wasted precious time by watching it. My fiancee and I were overjoyed when the little robot boy finally found his Mommy - not because it was dramatic or tear-jerking, but because we knew the movie would soon be over. This movie [is not good]!
B000002TQV|5.0|If you love rock, if you love indie rock, if you love prog rock or art rock, if you love anthemic kick...rock, if you just love good music with catchy guitar licks, wonderfully unpredictable but perfectly realized drumming, singing that never fails to amaze, and production that is expressive and atmospheric, this album is, simply put, a must have.  I can't say it any better than to say this is one of those perfect albums, with every song feeding beautifully into the next, and the whole album adding up to more than the sum of its parts, that you can listen to forever and you never have to skip a single song.  Perfect rock album.  Perfect.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I used to be a pretty BIG Britney fan and then died out, but i'd heard such wonderful things about this cd, thinking it was going to be good i went out and bought it. I was shocked at how wrong everyone was.  It lacked something, her emotion.  No offence to britney or other artists like her but she could of taken more time to make the tracks better using better vocals etc. It also seemed she talked about the same thing over and over... herself and boyz don't get me wrong good topic but after awhile it gets old. Lots of Talking Lacked the Singing like we saw in her 1st album...
B00003CX5P|1.0|I remember when this film opened. People were quitting their jobs and camping in front of the Cinerama for two months just to be the first to see the long awaited spectacle. Will it bring world peace? Will it cure cancer? Well, sheesh. I left work early on opening day to catch a matinee at an out of the way theater. I was able to walk right in, see the movie, and then go about the rest of my life. I felt so sorry for those unfortunates who wasted so much time in anticipation for this poorly written, acted, and directed film. Yeah, a lot of things go boom! Neat. This was a film of no substance whatsoever. There was nothing of the fun, the mythos, the joy of the first film. What we got instead was a marketing ploy, nothing more. There ought to be a cosmic law in which Mr. Lucas would be obligated to pay back the time wasted by those who watched this drivel.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is such a great book. Scott caught my attention from the beginning as I was trying to figure out what kind of monitor he kept talking about. Once I caught on to what he was talking about and the importance of the monitor, I began to enjoy the book. Ender's Game is a book that tells of Buggers having invaded planet earth two times. Because of the previous invasions, the government decides to prepare themselves for the next invasion. The society is completely controlled by the government. Ender came out of a family of geniuses. Out of the family, he was the one who was picked to go to the Battle School. The government has no feelings when it comes to the life Ender has to live. They feel as if Ender was born for one reason only and that was to help in the defeat of the Buggers. Although Ender is forced to do certain things, he still has problems just as all the kids do. Ender has to choose between right and wrong on many occasions. One reason why I really liked this book is because some of the things that Ender had to go through were real life situations and I could relate to them. I am not a big reader of science fiction but I really enjoyed this book.

The plot, everything is wonderful. Even though it's plot is not historically right, or however you say it, it's still wonderful. Kirsten Dunst, John Cusack, and Kelsey Grammar are some of the voices in this movie.

B00005QZ7U|1.0|Ok...maybe not the worst movie of 2001..but the worst of the ones I saw. I tried to give it another chance on DVD. I can now say it was the worst DVD I have so far seen in 2002. The story line..and I use the phrase loosely..is so bland that it will put you to sleep.It did have great photography though it was the one area in which this film could be termed outstanding. This film is a great example of why the musical, in film form, died. If this film is an attempt to bring it back, well they surely have failed. Leave the musicals to Broadway and live productions and spare us the film makers attempts at so called \\"art\\". This was a very hard film for me to take as I am a big Nicole Kidman fan. Most of my friends would say I would pay [money] to watch her brush her teeth for 2+ hours....
B0000634EV|4.0|First of all, I love DOWN. Just a perfect supergroup. NOLA was outstanding. Small warning. If you looking for the Pantera version of Phil, DOWN is probably not for you.

B00005MAM2|5.0|I saw Akira in the theater when I was twelve, and I've loved it ever since.  This edition has numerous features, too many to go into, I'll just say they provide interesting information, and that Akira justifies having these features provided.  It's that great a film.  The animation is fantastically detailed, both realistic and imaginative.  Flying, driving motorcycles, and mutating into a superblob are all depicted beautifully.  This is like no other movie, ever.  You've never seen anything like this before.  Tetsuo Shima's horrific journey from street punk to demi-god is treated seriously - it seems just as unreal and scary to him as it does to us watching.  The story is crammed into two hours, but it is an excellent adaptation of the manga.  Everyone should see this movie once.  Those who love it will enjoy watching it over and over again.
0375728007|4.0|this is one of the best books i have ever read. i believe that it is one of the best books i have ever read because jaimie and landons relationship taught me that love can come and go but it is something that you never forget and that you carry with you for the rest of your life.

My favorites are; Thank you, Baba, Front row, The couch, among all the others...
B00004W50T|4.0|The famous first album by everyones favorite Canadian mountain-men, The Band.  This record has been lauded over by critics for over 30 years, and deservedly so.  This record marked one of the significant turning points in rock music that happened in 1968.  The turning point being a return to more traditional music values(the others that contributed in '68 were Dylan, the Stones, and the Byrds, among others).  Far removed from the psychedelic access that was popular at the time.  \\"Music...\\" offered a more rural, mature standpoint to songwriting and greatly influence the popular artists at the time.  Clapton practically worshipped the record and all it stood for.<br />The music is something so original that it is hard to categorize.  Opening with the Manuel-Dylan penned \\"Tears of Rage\\" in which Manuel delivers one of his most heartfelt vocals.  It is far superior to the Dylan-sung \\"Basement Tapes\\" version.  The next song is really the only song on the album I dont thoroughly enjoy, \\"Kingdom Come\\", and probably because Robbie Robertson sung it.  This is the record with the Band's classic \\"The Weight\\", one of Robertson's best tunes.  All over there is the unique Band touches.  Garth's extremely one of a kind organ playing, especially on his tour-de-force \\"Chest Fever\\".  Manuels emotional beauty on \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" and \\"In A Station\\".  Danko plays the \\"aw shucks\\" farmboy wonderfully on \\"Long Black Vail\\" and \\"Caledonia Mission\\".  And Robbie Robertsons precision guitar and Levon's crackshot drumming fill up all the spaces.  The thing about the band is the distinct voices each member has, not only with vocals, but also their playing.  The album closes with Dylan's \\"I Shall Be Released\\" another poignant Manuel vocal, and beautiful ensemble playing by the rest. A definate recomendation to anyone with even a slight interest in REAL good music.
0385503954|5.0|On March 31, 2002, Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT debuted at #4 on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction bestseller list, ranking just behind distinctly non-literary fare by Patterson, Grisham, and Steele. The fact that people are buying such a beautiful book as ATONEMENT, in such HUGE numbers, almost single-handedly has restored my faith in the reading tastes of the American public.<br />READ THIS BOOK, AND LEARN WHAT TRULY GREAT LITERATURE IS ALL ABOUT!!
6303942830|5.0|Since this is one of my favorite movies and I like everything about it, I don't really know where to begin... <br />It's *very* leisurely based upon the novel by Fenimore Cooper, but don't look for the same plot or the same character build, because it's different. And please look for the plot in another review, I'm not going to describe it again :).<br />Three things make this film great:<br />1. The acting; I loved each and every one of the actors, they created their characters beautifully. I especially loved Madeleine Stowe, she was perfect for the role with her apparent fragility concealing inner strength and delicate beauty. Daniel Day-Lewis was also great, very masculine and strong without being handsome in the classic way.<br />2. The landscapes. Except for Seven Years In Tibet I don't think I have ever seen such magnificent scenery in a movie, grandiose, breathtaking: mountains, rivers, waterfalls, forests. Sadly this is best seen in cinema (and I did watch the movie on the big screen no less than 4 times)<br />3. The music. I don't have enough praise words for the soundtrack, it is the most beautiful one I have ever listened to, and fit together absolutely perfectly with the images and with what was happening. I wouldn't change any single note on it. At least 30% of the movie is the soundtrack.<br />All these are wonderfully put together in a heart-warming drama about sacrifice, love, adventure.<br />Note: This review is for the movie itself, not the VHS edition nor the DVD edition.
0446678430|1.0|I didn't think these books could get any worse, but they just did. This is the worst of the bunch. I've read them all, just for entertainment purposes, because I just can't believe that these things could help anyone, other than the author.<br />First of all, the entire premise of these books is wrong, since it is certainly very possible to become rich by getting a good education, getting a good job, being frugal, and investing your savings for the long run. I have plenty of friends and family who have done so. I'm working on the same thing myself. I have no doubt that I'll be able to accomplish my goals, nor do I think that those goals are particularly difficult to attain.<br />No, you do not need to own your own business or buy rental real estate to become wealthy. Statistically, 98% of small businesses fail. The odds of your acheiving wealth by getting a good job, and investing your savings are much higher than that. The amount of rental real estate you need to own to generate enough income to be considered wealthy is also quite high, depending on where you live. Owning a couple of four unit garden apartments isn't going to do it. It's doable, but it would take you many years to be able to put together that type of a real estate portfolio. Where I live it would take about 100 units. I know, because a friend of mine owns about 100 rental units in my area.<br />Do yourself a favor and skip all of these books.  They're worse than a waste of your time because they tell you  can't acheive wealth in a conventional way, which may cause you to doubt yourself and stop trying. <br /> Read the reviews of these things. People say, &quot;Oh, this is a great book&quot;, but nobody says they've made any money by reading them and following their questionable advice. They're like mindless sheep, reading the finance bestsellers and talking about how great they are. But almost nobody will get anything useful out of any of this guys books.<br />Read Millionaire Next Door, and EightSteps to Seven Figures instead. They're much more useful, and you'll feel a whole lot better after reading them.
6302787122|4.0|This updating of The Return of Martin Guerre is as beautiful and compelling as it is complex, with intriguing characters who tackle questions of integrity, morality and hope. Richard Gere plays Jack Sommersby as a man given a second chance at life, a fact more true than anyone realizes at first.<br />When I first saw it, I had no idea what to expect. When it was over, I was astonished at the beauty of what I had seen, and I had to go back a second time to truly understand what I witnessed. Extremely well-done and well-acted (especially Bill Pullman, who threatens to walk away with the movie).
B00000AFGM|5.0|People see Marilyn Manson and assume he's all goth and scary, which is probably true. Marilyn Manson has probably the worst reputation in the music business as well as the world. I thought so myself, until I head some songs off MECHANICAL ANIMALS. I just fell in love with them! They were amazing! The sound was extrodinary, the lyrics were suprisingly deep, and it wasn't just all goth 'ooh god is dead' stuff. Evidently, Manson changed from heavy metal goth rock to glam rock when he came out with 'Mechanical Animals'. Some say he is just trying to be like David Bowie- but if he is, isn't he doing a good job at it? Another reason I bought this album was because Manson's pal Billy Corgan [Smashing Pumpkins] helped produce the album, and most of the music was probably influenced somewhat by Billy Corgan as well as David Bowie and the whole Glam thing. This CD is not like Antichrist Superstar, but it does have the essence of Marilyn Manson it, so some songs are kind of dark maybe a little goth. The cover may freak some out, but it's part of Manson's new look- kind of as a mechanical animal alien type. Mechanical Animals is the 2nd CD of a trilogy Manson made... the first one was Antichrist Superstar, which basically told the world what he thinks about religon, the 2nd is Mechanical Animals and is mostly about people/society and drugs, and the 3rd is Holy Wood which is how Manson feels about his decaying world. I would reccommend both, Holy Wood has some softer and deeper lyrics (with the heavy metal) while Antichrist Superstar is more hard rock. Manson also is coming out with a new album, and has some other CD's, which you can check out. The big reason I love this album is the songs. They are amazing!<BR>-Great Big White World: a slow but rock ballad about how the world is... I totally agree<BR>-The Dope Show: a famous Manson song about drugs, and an excellent one too!<BR>-Mechanical Animals: a kind of goth rock song with deep lyrics and a few acoustic parts that are quite touching<BR>-Rock Is Dead: a hard rock Manson classic, an excellent song<BR>-Disassociative: a slow rock song, pretty sad but very good, one of my favorites<BR>-Speed of Pain: a sad acoustic rock ballad with deep lyrics<BR>-Posthuman: a head banging anti-religon song that I love!<BR>-I Want To Disappear: a glam-like rock song, one of my favorites<BR>-I Don't Like The Drugs: a classic, deep lyrics, and totally cool and very catchy<BR>-New Model, No. 15: a glam rock kind of song that I didn't like first, but I began to enjoy<BR>-User Friendly: kind of harsh lyrics in this rock song, OK, but not one of my favorites<BR>-Fundamentally Loathesome: a slow and sad song, I don't really like it<BR>-The Last Day On Earth: a slower rock song, pretty good, not the best<BR>-Coma White: my favorite track on this CD, an extremelly well done slow ballad rock song about Manson's battle with love and pills. A classic!<BR>I hope my review of this amazing CD helped influence you to BUY IT NOW! IT IS WORTH IT! If you like rock, glam rock, alternative rock, you should buy this! Don't be ashamed if you don't really like Manson, this is an awesome CD. This was first Manson CD, and now I'm somewhat of a fan. If you enjoy Manson, this is a must have. SO GO BUY IT NOW!
6300184064|4.0|Dystopia in both popular culture and literature tend to lampoon left of center utopian dreams. Rarely, e.g. \\"Handmaiden's Tale\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" (read the books, skip the movies), does the \\"Right\\" take it in the jaw... Why is this? Perhaps because the Left's utopian vision is more inclusive, more intellectualized, (and therefore more seductive) then one from the Right? No, I think, though it is tempting, the real reason I think lies in the fact (e.g.) that groups like the Nazis' basically went out and did what they said they would, like enslave everybody not like them, and horribly murder minority communities, while, at the height of The Great Purge, Stalin's Soviet Union pushed through a National Anthem which said innocently \\"I don't know anywhere where anyone could breath so freely....\\". It is this juxaposition that struck authors Orwell (\\"1984\\") and Zaymatin (\\"We\\") so fiercely. Consider the lush theme song in \\"Brazil\\" versus the grimy world one encounters. The Pryce Character's Fantasy versus his Reality. It is the difference between what is touted to what is served that creates Irony, as in Spiro's restaurant. The lines that give it away are among the first, where Mrs. Buttle reads the last few lines of Charles Dickens \\"Christmas Carol\\" verbatim: \\"He was better than his word. He Did It All....\\", just before the huge mindless state machine (set up with the intention to do exactly what the Reformed Scrooge, the formerly despicable moneylender, does) destroys their family. The bloody-minded former Imperial Power, reformed like Scrooge by \\"Old Labour\\", is unleasing on its own people. The Same \\"Civilizing Mission\\", the same vicious results. Gilliam is saying: \\"You want Compassion? You want no Homelessness? Full employment? Birth to Grave benefits? Careful what you wish!\\" But Gilliam has to know he is joshing us. As doctors become almost a luxury for American poor, and the distance between the life of rich and poor in the U.S. becomes shockingly extreme, the \\"Old British Labour Programme\\" Gilliam attacks (with its hulking bureaucracy) looks less and less laughable. The Republicans are doing just what they said they would do, and generally, sans massacre and resorting only to wage slavery... Gilliam's \\"The Fisher King\\" is perhaps more apt than his \\"Brazil\\". But like other intellectual jabs from the Right, such as \\"Lord of the Flies\\", these are attacks that need to be met in force, not dismissed. Follow this film with Gilliam's own \\"Fisher King\\" as a chaser, or else \\"Gattaca\\", primarily for a corporate future as bad as Brazil's Welfare State.
B00005JKEC|5.0|I think Mr. Washington with his smooth fine chocolate self does any movie a great justice. He is such a good actor. I liked the way he had poor ethan hawk running around doing things he wouldn't do only a great mind could get someone do something that they normal don't do. I like the way Denzel goes and find out what his charater is all about and takes some training to do his job well. I would like everyone to know that I am a very very very big fan of Denzel's and I have every movie he has made so far including St. Elsewhere. so just about anything he does is fine with me, but training day will certainly take you out of your comfort zone because we are use to seeming him in films that he is the &quot;good guy&quot;. I think who ever watches this film will still love it.
B000001FN1|5.0|It was in 1988 that I first heard Triumph and Agony, and Warlock, screaming pure rock; the type I hadn't heard of till that day. To be honest, I hadn't been curious about the band, and their style.I was then, influenced by much harder and heavier bands like Running Wild (of which I'm still a great fan)and Mercyful Fate.I wasd simply under an influence by many more thrash and black metal bands, therefore, I hadn't given a damn for slower and especially female singer featuring bands.How wrong had I been then!! Warlock was just the type I wanted to hear of, with incredibly agrressive riffs as in 'I rule the Ruins'.That was the first track I had heard in a tape  which I had barrowed from a friend.This song struck me,and  surely would be chasing after the entire album.Having bought it, I witnessed how heavy rock should be played,including both mysterious and sentimental lyrics throughout the album.Metal Tango,Kiss of Death,Touch of Evil,are timeless rockers, and Make Time for Love; this power bollad has the spirit of melancholy, and loneliness, it makes me want to fall in love each time I hear it,even today.Fr Immer is also another power ballad, half German, half English totally different from the rest of the tracks in the album.Less solid, and talking of a mysterious love, which reveals the sentimental side of Doro.It fits her I confess, to scream for love as well as screaming for Burning the wiches! Metal Tango has the first and only tango rhythms adopted with electrical guitar, which drove me crazy back then.To sum up, the album is a complete success in German metal history,still stands proud against today's so called Underground and grunge..
B000002B7S|5.0|Many will think I'm really sticking my neck out here by giving this album 5 stars, but one must give credit where credit is due. Other reviews of this album share a similar pattern of failing comparisons to \\"Diary\\" and \\"Blizzard\\" and comments about Jake E. Lee not filling the large shoes left by Randy Rhoads. But pound for pound, isn't this product just as good as the first two? Jake is more than capable and very impressive in this masterpiece. Can anyone else have been able to successfully follow a legend? Probably not. Jake reveals some powerful riffs in the title song and \\"Now you see it, now you don't\\" as well as \\"Rock and Roll Rebel\\". Another member of the band normally unmentioned is Bob Daisley on bass. This entire album has some seriously powerful bass tracks and I must rate Bob as one of the better bassists of the time. Haunting tracks such as \\"Center of Eternity\\" and \\"Waiting for Darkness\\" add to the powerful emotion of the album. Sure, \\"So Tired\\" isn't anything spectacular, but \\"You're No Different\\" grows on you. I give this album 5 stars because its truly wall to wall and Ozzy put forth some great songwriting and surrounded himself with the best musicians of that era. This album is a symbol of perserverence following the death of a musical legend. Get it now if you're an Ozzy fan or a fan of metal, I promise you'll love it.
B000058B2W|5.0|Exotic Bords &amp; Fruit has to be one of the most intoxitcating, addictive recordings I have ever had the pleasure of listening.  Although I have not heard this recording in about twenty years it has lost none of what I enjoyed most about Procol Harem, the hearfelt vocals and some damn good musicians playing for all their worth.
B000002I2G|4.0|This was generally the least well-received of the six Doors studio albums, tho many people like it.  More than any other Doors album, it lends itself to subjective derailment from attempted objective comments.  I will do my best here, and in any event, my comments are somewhat in between.  Tho I believe \\"The Soft Parade\\" is the group's weakest effort, this is measured against an extremely high standard, and the album definitely has its moments.<br />What is clear is that The Doors' power, most in display in its first two efforts, was fading for now.  This is true not only in the case of Robbie Krieger's brass/string-backed songs but Jim's songs.  Nevertheless, the Morrison compositions \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"Shaman's Blues\\" contain excellent lyrics, the former being accompanied by an interesting primitive beat with the Doors trademark sound.  \\"Shaman's Blues,\\" too, is Doors-like, in hypnotic, if not hard-driving, feel, and it creates a compelling mood.<br />Along with these two, the title cut is the highlight of the album, and does not compare unfavorably to the band's other long cuts.  The music is somewhat incoherent, but still interesting, moving from the isolation of the beginning to the simple, steady progression of the second part.  Sort of like you are on a float in an underground amusement park ride, riding the rails through visual images.<br />I liked \\"Touch Me\\" a lot when I was younger, but am now somewhat ambivalent because of its excesses, tho they are not as much as those of \\"Tell All the People.\\"  Robbie's dedicated-to-Otis lyrics outdo his voice in \\"Runnin' Blue,\\" but a sort of catchy main verse is accompanied by an unmatching odd bluegrass chorus.  \\"Wishful, Sinful\\" is the best Krieger entry, pretty with an underwater feel (see also \\"Underwater Fall\\" in Robbie's solo album \\"Versions\\"), altho it is cloyed at one moment too.  \\"Easy Ride\\" (Morrison) and \\"Do It\\" (Morrrison/Krieger) seem sort of like the same song, both being silly and flippant, but the former has a little more substance.<br />This album reflects the last vestige of the original Doors sound, somewhat degenerated, but still enjoyable for those who like it.  Morrison Hotel was the polar opposite, with hard rock and blues.  LA Woman then mixed this with some more-refined, prettier sounds and instrumental solos.  This serves as a reminder that \\"The Soft Parade\\" was not an ending downhill point for this immensely talented band, but an inflection point for a new direction.  Then we can realize, too, this album isn't that bad itself, is it?has a little more substance.<br />This album reflects the last vestige of the original Doors sound, somewhat degenerated, but still enjoyable for those who like it.

031286504X|5.0|Prior to reading I Am Legend, I had never read any other 'vampire' novels. This is the 2nd book in the SF Masterworks series, and once you read it, you know why. The story is reminiscent to John Wyndham's Day Of The Triffids in the fact that it's a 'one man against the world story'. It is based around the daily life of Robert Neville - the last normal human being left on Earth - everyone else being blood hungry vampires, who are all rather keen to get hold Neville and suck him dry.<br />You find yourself greatly empathising with Neville as he goes about his daily routine of venturing out of his heavily fortified house until sunset, to try and dispose of his antagonizers in a slow and grizzly manner. By night he remains sheltered, drinking himself stupid with whisky (the glasses of which always end up rather comically smashed against a wall).<br />The book more than anything, explores the endurance of Neville as he endures the endless daily battering of his house and mind against his innumerable foe. The book flows from beginning to end, and regardless of your usual choice of book, I'm confident that I Am Legend would be enjoyed by all.
B00005QAPH|5.0|...Watching the DVD I bought from Amazon, I was stunned.<br />The clarity of light on the cars in the famous opening sequence literally shines! There is one other scene in particular where Mastroianni stands in front of a light -- an effect I'm certain Fellini realized -- and you can literally see the light shine from his graying hair. Even the subtitles have been re-done. I can remember looking at the fuzzy subtitles on the VHS and struggling to concentrate. On this Criterion Collection DVD, they are crisp and clear as anything on the market.<br />Most significant to me, though: the commentary section! Though I've watched this film a few times (I can still remember getting chills up my spine the first time I saw the opening sequence) the commentary will blow you away with how complex this 2 hour film is. Though it is a film that is fun enough to watch for its own sake -- the commentary read like a guidebook to Picasso's cubist period, explaining the significance of casting certain characters, various symbols: for example, the watch given to Mastroianni by the Producer in the film echoes Fellini's own producer giving him a watch under similar circumstances after his filming La Dolce Vita. There are many like images and symbols explained. The depth of commentary made this film Ten Times more complex than without -- and yet, even realizing how much more complex and personal this film is, it's still the fun 2 hour film it'll always be! It's just that watching it now is watching a film with thirty years of wisdom packed into one DVD. Amazing. Nina Rota's score is a trip! I've only had time, so far, to browse over the interview section on Disc 2 (nearly three hours worth of interviews). My hope here is that this amazon.com review will give you an indication that: There's enough info, entertainment, and analysis on this DVD to keep you interested and entertained for plenty 'o time to come!<br />It is the best DVD I have ever bought...
B00005UEAR|5.0|With the exception of Awake, this is my favorite CD by Dream Theater.  This 2 disk set is incredible.  The second CD is 1 big long song.  For anyone who like music with spine, DT is the band to listen to.  This CD has a mix of music with pyrotechnics here and there.  I have no idea how they can pull this stuff off live.  Worth getting.
B000020617|5.0|Dave Grohl and his bandmates have almost outdone themselves with this one. They've combined amazing guitar and drum work with beautiful vocals on one probably their greatest album ever to come out. Every song is great, from softer songs like \\"Aurora\\" and \\"Next Year\\" to my personal favorite \\"Stacked Actors\\" that has a great driving beat and energetic guitar riffs, and of course then you can't forget \\"Generator\\" with it's cool beginning or \\"MIA\\" a slightly slower song with a powerful chorus and my second favorite.<BR> It is true though, this CD is a little closer to pop music than the other two, but hey it's not pop music, it's rock; it's the Foo Fighters! I would recommend this album to anyone.
B00005Y228|5.0|The great thing about Kylie Minogue is that she has the capacity to travel through time, pick up sounds from each era, and put them all together in ways that Donna Summer and Olivia Newton John could not. 'Fever', perhaps this year's finest electronica and disco album combined, is testament to the fact that Minogue is one of the most enjoyable songstresses around today. Shes one of the few artists around to have No. 1 singles three decades in a row, and shes still only in her 30s!<br />I enjoyed this album because it did something that I haven't found much of on other female pop singer's sets. It combines the electronic feel of Madonna's 'Music', Mirwais' 'Production' and Tricky's 'Blowback', with the summery, carefree dancefloor rhythms of Olivia Newton John's 'Physical', and the soundtrack to 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'. If this all sounds strange to you, then listening to the album in its entirety is an experience unto itself. When I first heard it over the Internet, I was quick to dismiss 'Fever' as another jaded product from a land currently sagging under the weight of the Sophie Ellis Bextors and Gareth Gates. Fortunately, I must report that this is one instance where mp3 does not do justice to the quality of an album. There are so many subtle nuances to 'Fever', a sound at the back, a tinkle there - its a rich, multilayered pop extravaganza - complete with camp and high art.<br />I didn't take to this album immediately, mind you. The first thing I played was 'Can't get you out of my head', which upon inspection now that I've had 'Fever' for a while, is perhaps the most annoying track off the entire CD. There are many gems on this set that are worth more of your time, one of them being the title track.<br />Kylie's strengths over the course of her last few albums have increased vastly. Once a Stock Aitken Waterman puppet, her lyrics were known for their absolute throwaway value, a nemesis she has since worked against, culminating in 1997's beautiful 'Impossible Princess', which, till date, is Kylie's most musically lush, and lyrically deep album. On her last CD 'Light Years' and even on 'Fever', lyrics take a back seat to melody. Its true, even though these songs are pop perfection laced in creme de banane stringlets, they reek of poor songwriting, and even suggest a certain lack of intellect. But Kylie's intent may have been just to produce a fine little pop odyssey, and if thats all she wanted, then she got what she set out to do.<br />'More More More' is the track that opens the album. There are tracks on this album that spell out 'F-I-L-L-E-R', but thats a small price to pay considering how incredibly catchy most of the other tracks are. My favorites are Track 2 - 'Love at first sight', and Track 10, an underrated little ditty called 'Love Affair'. Unlike Madonna, Kylie's songwriting abilities have gone from bad to worse - almost all the tracks here have the words 'baby', 'love', 'boy', 'night', 'heaven', 'body' - which might suggest that the album lacks a certain je ne sais quoi. Your grandmother's lounge record this is not, nor is it the lyrical counterpart to even the new Jennifer Lopez CD, but its no slouch either.<br />As if to prove a point, Capitol tagged on two bonus tracks for this limited edition, which may or may not be sold out depending on which time of year or decade you're reading this. 'Boy', which was a UK single B-side, is by far the best track on 'Fever'. Kylie's plusses are that she is incredibly fan-friendly and puts out an incredible body of work with every release (kind of like Bjork, only Kylie has never won an award at Cannes) - 'Boy' is exactly the kind of song that The Neptunes would award with a Song of the Year trophy. The album ends with a single taken from Kylie's last studio album that wasn't released in the US, called 'Butterfly'.<br />Pros : Near everything. The album is a rollercoaster ride with every song being a fast-paced little number. Its also very bouncyand happy, and even if the lyrics are sappy, they're all extremely cheery and depression-free. Note to Suzanne Vega and Fiona Apple : Get over it.<br />Cons : There isn't a single ballad. 'Fragile' comes close to being one, but even thats got a pumping bass thats very distracting (in a nice way!). Also, the liner notes, while very pretty, do NOT include the lyrics. Hey, even if the lyrics aren't exactly Rabindranath Tagore, its worth including them just so that fans can sing along. But perhaps its a compliment to Kylie's diction that we can understand almost every word she sings, which makes lyric-reprinting rather redundant. Forgiven, then.<br />High Points : The chorus to 'Love at first sight'. This track is screaming out to be a single. Then theres the incredible opening beat to 'Boy', and near everything about that song. 'In you eyes' has a thwumper of a bass, and the place where it goes so deep as if about to disappear, only to surface again is a shameful delight. The chorus to 'Love Affair', and the sheer brilliance of the title track 'Fever' - quite unlike all the other songs on the album (which is also a good thing, in a good way).<br />This record seems as if it was made in the 1970s, only to be rediscovered in the 2000s by some German underground producer and rehashed into the psycho crystal swan that it is. 'Fever' is an unabashed celebration of all things good with pop music, and, by some quirky miracle, is perhaps the greatest pop record this year by a female artist.<br />Highly recommended.

B00003CXXP|1.0|I just had to take a moment to warn everyone on this ridiculously stupid movie! The commercials bill it as a fun tale of a family whose \\"robot\\" son becomes a feeling, loving, human-like child. Yet, this part of the story only lasted for about 1/3 of the movie.<br />Next thing we know, the child is tossed out and goes on an adventure. At this point, I was thinking the movie might still be going somewhere. Unfortunately, it just dragged on with non-sensical, drawn out reasoning. Still, I had hope. <br />Then, after the boy prayed to a statue until he became frozen for hundreds of years, I lost all hope. Even so, I watched. But, when they brought out the aliens I laughed my head off. When one of them sat down with the boy to give him a very long, pointed, philosophical view of the universe, world and the meaning of life- I laughed even harder and shut it off.<br />Unfortunately, they continued to try to mix drama, with science fiction, with fairy tale, with esoterical overtones... in which none of them were followed through. None of them panned out or resolved.<br />It was clear that this movie's entire purpose was to lead the viewers up to this new-age sermon on life and our existance. Yet, they sure took the long way around to get to their point! <br />
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is an excellent newbery that portraits a world unlike our own. That world is a well organized society where people are put into jobs by the Elderly and a happy, peaceful place. However, this world is dull in color and sound. This is a place that needs color and music. It also needs it's people to sense feelings and even weather: happiness, coldness, and disaster. A boy named Jonas has been chosen to hold these memories of the past, for his job is the Receiver ,from the Giver (pervious Receiver). But, now he sees how his world is dull in appearance and understanding, he's goimg to change it.<BR>           I highly recommend this book because of it's text. This book has adventure and lots of cliffhangers, which will make you want to just keep reading. I believe, one of the most important things this book is trying to help us understand our world. There are still many thing we haven't experienced like real starvation in poor countries or being bombed by planes.<BR>The Giver has helped me really understand our world.<BR>           My favorite part of this newbery is when Jonas is thinking about what he has learned as a Receiver. He started to think about the world's past (our world). He compared it to his world to our's and found out one thing: the other people in the community have no experience with real feelings. Once, his sister said she was very angry for a boy cutting inline for a slide. However, she has no idea what anger is, like Jonas. She  felt only shallow impatience, not true anger. This is why it is my favorite part.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I liked this a lot better when it was iggy popp's record called &quot;lust for life.&quot;
B00003CXTG|1.0|sure the special effects were nice, but the movie as a whole was garbage.
B00005JKED|5.0|All right...let it be said first off...Denzel got the Oscar, and no one deserved it more.  In this film, Denzel proves that he can play characters who are FAR from being nice guys.  Generally, he plays wholesome (or at least semi-wholesome) characters in his films and has been regarded by many as a great actor who, unfortunately, takes \\"safe\\" roles.  Well, my God...if this film didn't shatter that mold, nothing ever will.  Denzel's Alonzo is a foul-mouthed, fast-talking, street-wise demon who runs wild with a gun and badge, abiding only the rules of the street.  As for the rest of the film, I loved it.  Not a bad performance in it, though Dr. Dre could have done better.  Powerful direction, strong cinematography, great script.  Yes, I know...there are always detractors out there.  Like the guy who says \\"How do we know Denzel's a cop?  No uniform, never goes to the police station...how do we KNOW?\\"  Well...how 'bout that badge, smart guy?  He's a NARC, man!  Narcs don't wear uniforms...it would kind of defeat the purpose of undercover work, wouldn't it?  And as we know from the phone call he makes to Jake (Ethan Hawke) in the opening scene, Alonzo doesn't do roll call.  And then there are those who say \\"He doesn't have to answer to anyone, man...who's gonna believe cops act like that?\\"  Well...me, for one.  This is the LAPD we're talking about...probably THE most corrupt police department in the country.  And he's a ranking detective with his own division...he can pretty much write his own ticket most of the time...cuz like he says, \\"It's not what you know.  It's what you can prove.\\"  And I believe it was the same reviewer who said that Scott Glenn's character, Roger, was Alonzo's \\"Mystery Friend,\\" and we had no idea who he was until later in the film.  I think it's pretty easy to discern from his first scene with Alonzo and Jake that Roger's a retired (or at least NEARLY retired) Narc.  We know that from the introduction of his character, as long as we pay attention.  And although it all hits you really fast and seems fairly incomprehensible upon first viewing, the subplot with his character is astonishingly easy to follow when you give the film another look.  That's the thing.  This film moves so fast, it takes a couple of viewings for everything to sink in...after a second viewing, everything is much clearer.  Well, no matter what, have a go at \\"Training Day.\\"  My advice is to watch it at least twice.  Denzel's performance is so mesmerizing that it can distract you the first time you watch it...and, as I said, it moves pretty fast.  My analysis:  Five Stars.  Best film of its kind to come out of Hollywood in the past five years.  Do yourself a favor and see it...twice.  Your senses will thank you.
0385495323|5.0|For anyone who is fascinated by codes, this book answers many questions and entertains at the same time.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This film is God.  When it comes to American cinema, it scarcely gets any better than this.  This film almost single-handedly renewed my faith in modern motion pictures.  There was never really any realistic chance that it would win the Oscar for Best Editing that it so richly deserved...but only because the Academy, despite a FEW good calls in the past, is still Satan.  See this film...NOW.  Why are you still reading?  Go to the video store right now.  I'm serious.
B0000549B0|5.0|\\"Harvey\\" a play written by Mary Chase began its long run on Broadway in 1944 and won the Pultizer Prize for best original American play in the same year.  Harvey ran for another 4 years for a total of 1775 appearances.  In 1950 Universal Studios acquired the film rights for a whopping $750,000 and signed Jimmy Stewart as the fun loving inebriate Elwood P. Dowd wealthy aire to the Dowd estate.<br />Summary;  Harvey is a whimsical story about a fun loving inebriate millionaire Elwood P. Dowd (Stewart - he is perfectly cast - in an Oscar Nomination Role for Best Actor) & his very large white invisible rabbit (6 foot 8 inches), Harvey.  Through his eccentric behavior with his friend Harvey, aggravates & is a constant embarressment to his family, especially his sister Vera Louise (Josephine Hull -  she came from the original Broadway cast - in an Oscar Winning performance - Best Supporting Actress).  Vera tries everyway to have Elwood addmitted to a mental hospital.  A wonderous journey & many funny turn of events occur.  And how everyones lives are effected by this unusual pair.<br />The DVD is a Black & White Full Screen (before WideScreen) presentation.  The video transfer is outstanding.  The extras/bonus materials include a 1990 Jimmy Stewart \\"Special introduction with photographic montage\\", production notes, mini bios & trailer.  A great family film.  Enjoy.
B00005JKEC|5.0|I was so pleased by this movie.  I got the opportunity to see Denzel Washington at what I will call truly his best.  To see his performance in this movie shows that he is truly a versatile actor.  Ethan Hawk also help to make this movie excellent as well.  A must see for anyone that enjoys action.
B000002WPI|5.0|In a world where every hip-hop album is a classic, the Wu-Tang Clan's 1993 debut would still stand apart from the rest.<BR>On the surface the drawing point is the stripped down and basement-raw production; complete with kung-fu samples, thumping drums and piano loops...a complete contrast to the gangsta-funk dominating the radio at the time.<BR>But the real gem here is the individual appeal of eight completely different and instantly recognizable mcs each bringing their own unique sound to the table.<BR>At the top you have Method Man's straight-blunted charisma, ODB's insane rambling and Ghostface's high pitched slang. You get a dose of Raekwon's rapid-fire pitch followed by GZA's slow and calculated wordplay.  Inspectah Deck is an mc's mc, while RZA's wicked flow goes straight for the throat and U-God's gruff voice assaults the track.<BR>All-killer, no-filler...there is something on here for every rap fan, from underground to commercial.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a movie for movie fans. It is a movie that does away with many conventional storyline elements and instead rewrites the rules. Its use of reversing the storyline (so it goes end, middle and beginning instead of beginning, middle and end) is as avantgarde a film technique you will find without heading down the path of film festival wierdness. <br />The storyline is intriguing and will hold the attention of a movie lover as they too try to work out what is going on. I don't know if this has been done before (I think I saw a film with a reverse storyline before but I can't remember it), but I doubt that the storyline relied heavily on the reversal as this movie did. It is not just a cheap gimmick; the twist in the movie is at the beginning not the end. So just sit back and enjoy it.
B00001IVOR|4.0|The year is 1997.  The hip-hop world has been rocked by the recent deaths of 2Pac and Notorious B.I.G.  Out of the tragedy emerges Puff Daddy...the complete opposite of the gangsta image that had emcompassed hip-hip music for the majority of a decade.  Suddenly, rappers everywhere begin dropping their thug persona to get &quot;jiggy&quot; and boast their bank accounts.<BR>Maybe this was one of the things working against the hardcore Wu-Tang Clan as they released their double-disc sophomore effort.  <br />The 9-man group had released five highly praised solo efforts between their group projects and with the anticipation of Wu-Tang Forever, seemed poised to officially lock down the title of world's best rap group.  But, alas, it was not to be.<BR>Deep down, Forever was and is a brilliant album.  Lyrically the Clan had progressed to a breaking point where listeners were forced to write out the words and analyze them to completely understand the gems contained.  Production-wise, RZA offered cleaner sounding and more high-tech sample-free beats than their stunning debut.  <BR>Unfortunately, the MTV crowd wasn't ready and party joints featuring juvenile lyricism laced over jacked-80's hits kept Forever from producing even one hit single.<BR>Sure, Forever isn't without its flaws.  With over 20 tracks, there is plenty of skip-worthy material and even the best tracks have difficulty holding up to most of the Clan's previous work.<BR>But a good album is still a good album and very few releases can stack up to this one.
B000002A46|5.0|I can only take Mariah Carey in small doses usually, but this is a magnificent album. Checkout 'O Holy Night'. It's probably up there with one of the greatest versions of this song. I'm not crazy about what seems to be the newst trend of 'Santa Claus is coming to Town', but other than that, it's a truly great album.
6303027016|4.0|Starring Robin Williams as Airman 1st Class Adrian Cronauer, this 1987 film is loosely based on a real radio DJ whose outrageous sense of comedy bucked authority and won the hearts of the American soldiers in 1965 Vietnam.  The audience never learns much about Cronauer's character as there is virtually no back story.  He is just set down in Vietnam at a time in history when the American police action is about to escalate. When he gets to know the Vietnamese villagers, however, his character slowly changes.  Of course there is conflict with his very uptight superiors which adds to the comedy.  Eventually though, the story becomes more complex than the comedy and, at film's end, Cronauer has become more mature and wiser.<br />I found myself giggling at the jokes, but eventually the comedy all had a certain sameness.  However, I did get into the story.  There wasn't much military action, only some strong hints of what was to come.  Wisely, the film focused on the characters and portrays the Vietnamese villagers as real people who Cronauer teaches to curse in American slang and with whom he plays baseball, using mangos as the ball.  This is a good video, lighthearted and yet with a message.  Robin Williams' performance is excellent.  And, although some of the action was a little too slow for my taste and the comedy ran thin early, I still do give it a good recommendation.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I first heard Radiohead's Creep and thought it was pretty cool. I didn't buy any of their CDs though. When I started to hear the buzz about OK Computer, I was skeptical. Jane's Addiction was the last band that received such rave reviews. That turned out to be alot of hype. I gave in and purchased OK Computer. Much to my suprise, all the praise was warranted.This album is in a league of it's own. The songs are not initially that accessible.I'm not sure how I would have reviewed it when I first listened to it. I probably would have said &quot;it's pretty good&quot;. As you listen again and again you begin to realize that the songs are so well crafted that you wonder how you missed it the first time through. There are very few albums that will hold up over time and still sound powerful after 5 or 10 years. OK Computer will stand the test of time. It's pure genius and anyone who tells you different doesn't know from good music so stay away from them. There is no blueprint for creating a musical masterpiece but if you are a modern musician you should study this CD from note to note.
B00005JKQX|5.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" certainly is the best picture of the year.  Based on a the true story of the paranoid schizophrenic, John Nash, who went on to win a Nobel Prize, Russell Crowe took on a difficult and demanding role.  Jennifer Connelly, who plays his understanding wife, won an Oscar for supporting actress and her performance was also excellent.  The highest accolades, however, must go to Ron Howard who directed it and Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay.  They certainly deserved the awards they won and, while good actors can be found everywhere, it is that special combination of knowing just what words to say or angle to shoot a scene that made this the perfect film.<br />It wasn't just the story, which is, in itself, awe-inspiring.  It was HOW that story was told and the message it proclaimed loud and clear that made it a winner.  The audience was pulled right into John Nash's mind.  We saw and felt his delusions.  We thought they were real.  And we were right there with him as he gradually came to realize that they were just a product of his mind.  Then, as story developed, we learned a valuable lesson, one that relates to all of us whether we admit it or not.  If it is possible for Mr. Nash to live with his demons and go on and make a valuable contribution to society, then all of us can learn to live with ours.  This theme rang true as I watched the film, and will live with me long after.  It's a beautiful concept and \\"The Beautiful Mind\\" is a winner on all counts.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  Don't miss it!
B000060MMI|5.0|Another ripper from F-Molly. I wasn't sure if &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; would stand up to the greatness of &quot;Swagger&quot; but it does and then some. There are few bands that can approach the power of the Pogues but these guys are coming damn close. Try to catch em live. They absolutely smoke.
0743216458|2.0|An entertaining book that lent itself well to an excellent miniseries.  The brief and very shallow source section at the end of the book did little to enhance the text and made it impossible to know exactly what historical research was done other than oral interviews.  My inquiring mind requires more substance concerning Ambrose's research.  The book kept ones interest fairly well although I found it fairly basic.  A good, light read. but if what you're looking for something with some real depth and historic data, this book isn't it. . .kind of like Ambrose gone Hollywood.
B00005RY7X|5.0|the first four words of this album speak for the rest of the album. Party time! While most musicians these days only sing about doom and gloom Andrew W.K offers a feel good  album. With catchy lyrics and poppy (but good) sounding guitars and keys this album is perfect for any fan of rock or punk music. My favorite songs are I Love NYC and Ready to Die. If you are a fan of bands like Def Leppard take a listen to this album. You can see Andrew W.K perform live on Saturday Night Live in April.

B00003CXPJ|4.0|The Ben Stiller film 'Zoolander' took the year 2001 by storm. It quickly became one of the funniest and greatest comedic accomplishments of the year. So what makes a film about a vacuous male model that has trouble turning left such an amusing film?<br />The answer is simple; finally a modern comedy that actually works. Great cast fabulous characters, good story line, hilarious cameos and the continuous dissing of male modeling. <br />Derek Zoolander (Stiller) VH1 male model of the year 3 times running life is turned upside down when his is usurped by the young and 'hot' model Hansel (Owen Wilson). Derek goes on a journey to find himself in a world that doesn't make sense to him. When he is brainwashed to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia by the evil Jakob Mugatu (Will Ferrel) who is upset as garment prices will rise due to the elimination of child slavery in Malaysia. Derek is forced to deal with both his homicidal tendencies when he hears the song 'Relax' as well as his superstition by Hansel. The result is pure comedy.<br />Sure the film essentially has a one running joke basis (That of making fun of the fashion world and male models) but it seems that the jokes don't remain stale. When the audience finally get tired of seeing 50 'looks' from Derek all exactly the same we suddenly see a petrol fight between a group of models set to 'Wake me up before you go, go' by Wham. The result of this constant changing of mood and comedy leads to the same jokes being fresh when they are initiated again.<br />In many cases having a lead star direct his/her own comedy film doesn't really work. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, namely Kevin Smith's films. But in Stiller's directorial debut who'd of thunk he would pull off the two roles so well. It's so very easy to see the intentions trying to be brought out by both Stiller and Wilson due to the fact they are real life best friends and thus it's easy to see the onstage repore they have and the directing supports this.<br />Some of the film's funniest moments stem from the cameos by recognized stars. David Duchovney plays a hand model from yesteryear who guides Zoolander through the world of assassination and intrigue that stems from the male model lifestyle. Billy Zane plays Derek's stalwart friend in the party scene and it's simply hilarious to here Zoolander say `Stay out of it Billy Zane'. I was simply howling with laughter when low and behold David Bowie appears to judge the walk-off in which Hansel decides to be daring and `go monk'. Also the use of Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller- Ben's father) of `Seinfeld' fame is hilarious and this father and son dichotomy works brilliantly in the context of the film.<br />The DVD is feature packed for a single disc. Deleted and extended scenes are actually very funny; some memorable scenes include dialogue between Hansel and Winona Ryder that was cut from the film. Sound and picture and both very good, the vibrant colors transfer perfectly to the DVD format and the exaggerated 80's soundtrack sounds great though a home theatre system. Not to be forgotten is the amazing menu screens that are only rivaled by `This is Spinal Tap' in which Derek puts in his own two cents about each button.<br />`Zoolander' is a comedy success. For a film that came from nowhere and immediately became a box office hit the film is amazing. A Stiller directorial debut is great and we can only hope he decides to do more base comedy like `Zoolander' in the future.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|I didn't see this movie expecting to see Academy Award winning performances.  Parts were very funny and the non-funny parts will still probably grow on me.
B000059MEK|5.0|this is an incredible cd. with the opening song, &quot;one more time&quot; this song gives you an example of the rest of the songs. &quot;aerodynamic&quot; is an awsome quitar song. &quot;digital love&quot; really dont sound like a &quot;love&quot; song, just some really good beats. &quot;harder better faster stronger&quot; is all computerized. they sing the vocals then mix it into this cool robotic voice on the coputer. &quot;high life&quot; is a really good song. you just cant get enough of this song!! with the repetetive word &quot;burn&quot; it really reminds you of &quot;around the world&quot; off homework, but high life being faster. but all in all, every song on here is great to listen/dance too. even if you dont like techno.
B00005K3O4|4.0|I had to get the DVD of this film after watching only part of it on the SciFi Channel. It is a complete riot from the story to the design to the cast. Each element is just right.<br />There is one hilarious bit involving an animal made from balloons that had me laughing out loud and still makes me chuckle remembering it.<br />I can't decide if this is a real \\"B\\" film or a take off on all the others. It is too well produced to be a typical \\"B\\" film. The sets are great, the effects are good and the acting not bad at all, so it is almost too good.<br />There is one deleted scene in which the female lead tells why she is afraid of clowns that should be in the film. It really illustrates why children can be and are afraid of real life clowns. These Klowns are scary in a horror film way, but personally I find the little old ladies who pretend to be clowns for birthday parties and holidays functions are infitley more terrifying than anything in the film. <br />Is it a great film? In it's way it is, but not in the terms of the typical Hollywood epics. It is fun, silly and a truly enjoyable way to waste an hour and a half.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Hey Everyone! Ryan Adam's Gold is definetely one of the best CD's I've ever bought. The whole CD is jam packed with kickin' songs, but my favorite track on the song is Somehow, Someday. It's so refreshing to see an artist who is a true musician. He writes, sings and performs equally awesome. Gold is a CD I can play from start to finish and find something special about each and every track. His new video for Answering Bell is beautiful too. Elton John at the end is a nice touch!
B000003BD3|5.0|... [The Who] kicked [butt]. My advice is get the CD, fine...  The who and Taj Mahal are both excellent.  Some very nice guitar playing on Yer Blues by Dr. Eric Clapton.  ...a great purchase all round.  Bring it on.....
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theaters latest offering is in usual epic form that fans have come to expect from the reigning kings of the progressive metal genre. While more ambitious in length and breadth than the 1999 concept Scenes from a memory, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is a bit scattered and jumbled with its themes of mental digression and emotional breakdown. The first CD is comprised of a mini-concept and a few isolated tracks. The Glass Prison, broken down into three movements is a bit heavier than DTs more recent works, reminiscent of 1994s Awake. The next two tracks, Blind Faith and Misunderstood (my personal favorites) arent as thematic lyrically, but fit nicely with the overall mood. Track four, the Great Debate brings out some social commentary on the pros and cons of genetic research and cloning. The song is textured with media sound bites that refer to the events that add to the context of The Great Debate. The final track on CD one, disappear is a rather somber and sad tune that appears to deal with death and loss. Clocking in at forty-two minutes, CD is the meat of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. While intended to be one actual song, its divided into eight separate tracks that explores the various expressions of mental illness. An instrumental Overture opens and sets the pace for the rest of the musical tapestry, at times sounding a bit like the old K-Tel Hooked on Classics. The second track, War Inside my Head deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder felt by a veteren of the Vietnam War. Each subsequent track appears to deal with different types of mental illness, though I couldnt quite discern a definite pattern. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence has the usual musical stylingsLabries soaring vocals, Petruccis complex and high-energy guitar, held together by Mike Portnoys phenomenal drumming. One highlight I found with Six Degrees was the second offering of Jordan Ruddess scintillating work on the keyboard. Rudess was the perfect compliment to the band after the departure of Kevin Moore and Derek Shirenian. While certainly not my favorite composition of Dream Theater, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence shows the natural evolution of a band that seems to get better and better.
0345440803|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book.  I've found most books on toddlers to be quite depressing.  Tracy's book actually makes me look forward to my baby's toddler days.  I feel like it will be challenging, but very fun and rewarding.<br />One of the things I enjoy most about Tracy's writing is her emphasis on the personhood of your child.  She wants you to really consider how your child is feeling.  I think this ties in very well to her chapter on accidental parenting, which talks about how your actions reinforce bad habits in your child.  I think that the interplay between understanding your child's feelings, and understanding how your behavior effects your child's behavior sets the stage for good discipline.<br />I also really liked her chapter on discipline.  I thought she presented a good case against spanking, but also provided parents with the tools they need to discipline effectively.  It isn't enough to tell someone not to spank, you also have to give them something to do besides spanking.<br />It was a wonderful book.  I think all parents of toddlers will learn from it.
B000002H8F|5.0|The simple fact is that the Pixies never put out a bad album, never wrote a bad song (well, maybe Make Believe wasn't so crash hot, but that was penned and sung by David Lovering, not Black Francis), and were basically the most awe-inspiring, incredible, unique and fundamental band ever to have made their indelible stamp on the musical universe. A review of this album is, therefore, unnecessary, but I'll still go so far as to chip in and say it's brilliant. Thankyou and goodnight.
0345440900|4.0|I thought this was a really great book.  It contains two out of the three major categories in childcare books.  It has parenting and child development information, but not medical information.<br />I really liked the conversational tone of the book.  It has the feel of sitting down to a nice cup of tea with Tracy.  There were lots of anecdotes of other mothers and babies, which I always appreciate.  <br />I found her characterization of the personality types of babies very helpful.  I often feel that parents are too often held accountable for their baby's personality.  Despite good parenting, some babies are just fussy.  Despite bad parents, some babies will still be angels.  Knowing your baby's personality can help make your job easier.<br />I really liked her &quot;flexible routine.&quot;  Too often schedules or routines are seen as being set in stone.  Tracy advocates viewing your routine in segments of time from nap to nap.  I feel this gives you much more freedom to do different things during the day, while still having a familiar pattern for your baby.<br />My biggest complaint is the chapter on breastfeeding.  It was terrible, really!  Some of her information is just crazy.  For example, she says you must drink SIXTEEN GLASSES of water a day.  She also says you must wipe your nipples with a cloth after nursing to prevent bacteria from growing.  However, women have glands around their nipples which secrete an antibacterial substance, so this is completely unnecessary.  I would recommend anyone skip the entire chapter and read a separate book on breastfeeding.  I suggest So That's What They're For by Janet Tamaro, as it is written in a similar tone.<br />However, with the exception of the breastfeeding chapter, I highly recommend the book.
B000002HAF|5.0|As a senior in highschool, I used to go to The Livingroom, in Providence (an tiny little grimy abandoned warehouse club) to see the Pixies when they were supporting this album (and later, Doolittle).  Black Francis would also show up occasionally to other bands' shows there. He'd walk around in his flannel shirt and they just seemed like a tiny little underground band. <BR>I could not have survived senior year without the Pixies, and it's great to hear that younger people have found their music as pleasurable.  <BR>If I could only listen to one CD for the rest of my life, it would be Surfer Rosa. <BR>(one more thing: the production of this album is amazing! I love how huge the drums sound.)
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie is one of his best. Just as he had me believing that he was Malcolm X, I believed this great actor was a crooked cop, so much so that I came home upset. <BR>Denzel is a beautiful man who played this role to the \\"T\\".  Who hasn't heard of corrupt cops?  Ethan was pretty good too.  Dr. Dre's role in this movie was better to me than his role in \\"The Wash\\"  If you buy this, you should go see \\"John Q\\".
B000002B7Y|2.0|Ozzy lost a little here. The drums are much flat, Zakks guitar is sometimes unhearable (very low). the sound is murky and emotionless. Of course, we have here the Ozzys quality in compositions. The bottom line: the material is good, but the production flawed.
B000063CPL|5.0|I dont know where to begin describing this masterpiece, Maiden are the true gods of metal, hell music in general. 3 of   the greatest guitarists to date: Dave, Adrian and Jannick(yes including Jannick).  Nicko pounds the drums away like lightning, while Steve Harris delivers his intense bass playing, and Bruce rocks on vocals like never before. This is his best live performance with maiden.  They play some great songs off of here, including 6 of them from Brave New World.  The intro is very cool, along with the Wickerman, Ghost of the Navigator, Brave New world, Blood Brothers, The Mercenary, and dream of mirrors.  They are all played with greatness, for those of you who caught the BVN tour, you cant miss this.  <BR>    It is so awesome to here all of them play together like on Wrathchild and 2 minutes 2 midnight, all three of them play a solo, and it is so cool how they arranged it that way.  Bruce sings the clansman and Sign of the Cross with pure greatness.(So cool when Jannick pulls out the acoustic guitar with the electric on the clansman and dream of mirrors)  Bruce's vocals on Fear of the Dark are just phenomenal, he has never sung that song with as much passion and fire as he does on this album.  If anyone and I mean anyone dislikes this album then you need to open your eyes and realize that Maiden will always be the metal gods no matter what, that is a fact.  If you disagree, then try to play their songs, with the same style they have, and you will see what I mean. Best live album yet, get it now. If you love metal then you must not be without this album or just this band period.  It is dynamite,  UP THE IRONS!!!
B000063CPL|1.0|ALone in the the middle of a third-class roster, Maiden really was the best act in the Rock in Rio III festival, realized in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in January, 2001. They proved for their critics that they still have a trick or two to teach the mediocre bands of nowadays.<BR>So, why am I rating this one star? Because theres absolutely no reason for a Maiden fan to buy another compilation from them. In recent years, we had a lot of live albums by Maiden, more the compilations Best of the Beast and Ed Hunter. Thats it: I dont see any reason for this product to exist. They should at least have recorded one more studio album with the reunited line-up. Sad, Maiden. Rod Smalwood is never satisfied with the money hes making...

6304602979|5.0|True Romance is one of the greatest films I have ever seen.With a star packed cast including Brad Pitt(seven,fight club),Patrica Arquette(Stigmata,Goodbye lover)and the gorgeous Christian Slater(Heathers,untamed heart).I found the film so sweet and I have since recomended it to all my friends.The storyline it's self was brillant.Clarence Whorley (Slater) is an amazing guy who falls in love with call girl Alabama (Arquette),he marries her and confronts her pimp \\"just to get her clothes\\" but he ends up killing him and leaving with a bag full of coke.Now the two newly-weds travel to L.A to sell the coke,but little do they know there are lots of angry gangsters who want their coke back,chasing them around.This film is NOT to be missed!!!
006092988X|5.0|It's certainly easy to see why this book is a classic. The haunting story of Francie Nolan, a young girl living in poverty in Brooklyn, strikes a chord deep within all of us. Beautifully told, this story draws us into Francie's early-20th century life-her father's drunkenness, her mother's disillusionment with life, her deep love of books- and makes us respond with empathy. This is certainly one of those books that trascends descriptions-it is simply a book about life that has become a classic because of its enduring truths. Betty Smith's strong main character, keen and startlingly truthful observations about life, and stark descriptions make this an unforgettable read-deserving many more than five &quot;stars.&quot;
B00005QIPH|4.0|They seem to be trying to sound like Velvet Underground, MC5 and The Stooges combined. Not the most original sound BUT... It's still better than the typical garbage out there in rock today. I got so tired of the grunge formula (quiet verse, and surprise loud chorus) that I had to resort to trying (and liking) jazz!! All in all if you're looking for a new sound -move along- but if you're looking for something that stands apart from garbage like - Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Blink 182, Nickelback, Puddle of Mud, Creed, Everclear(OH!! DO THEY BITE OR WHAT), and all those other pretentious, I'm more introspective and serious than you are type bands, then try this. It doesn't bite, and with today's rock music that's a start.<br />P.S. White Stripes don't bite at all - try them too
0061020710|3.0|I got started into the diskworld books a few years ago. I decided to start from the beginning and picked up &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and while I understood the story, it was like the main characters were in one situation and then Bam!, they are in another with no real explination to how they got there. Don't let my slightly negative remarks turn anyone away from this book. The later books do get better.
B00005AWMF|5.0|The music is great however, I bought it used and some of the songs are scratched.
B000002GEY|5.0|It's difficult to say exactly what the best Supertramp album is because they had so many greats but this one is perhaps not only their best  but also one of rocks greatest!  I can't think of another ablum that received so much airplay on so many different radio stations than this one. A Hall of Famer!!
0446677450|4.0|I find it very funny how many people react to this book (based on a couple of the reviews I read). There is nothing on the book's cover that says buy this book and become rich. I think the purpose of this book, which does pretty effectively, is to give you a mind set for financial freedom, not to give you a plugin formula that will make you rich in 3 days. I liked the book and gives you a different perspective to achieving financial freedom. If you are looking for a book with a step by step to becoming rich, look elsewhere and if you find it, I want to be the firt one to hear about it.
079073382X|5.0|At first, I was surprised I was even watching this movie.  I'm older now.  Been married for 20 years.  Not really into \\"chick flicks\\" but something about the dialog between these two young people caught my attention when I surfed into this movie.  These kids were truly something.  The young lady was everything I would want my daughter to be.  Smart, articulate, pretty, honest, independent and sensible.  She was a lot of fun to listen to.  The boy was honorable and really seemed to care for this girl.  I hope my sons treat the women they fall in love with with the same respect.  Why would a middle age guy like me like this movie?  I think it took me back to a time where I remember feeling the magic and excitment from meeting someone for the first time.  It was pretty nice to feel this again for a short time.  I guess I forgotten how it felt to be so intrigued by someone that nothing else in the world mattered.  It was rare to have this feeling and something that we will all remember when it does happen....or something we would want to experience again.  It's like a gift.  It reminded me of that Neil Young song Like a Hurricane.....\\"...that magic moment right before you kissed my lips, time just slips....\\".  I hope I remeber the words right.  This is truly an excellent movie with great dialog.  A true gem in a world of rotten, corny movies minus the breast shots and gratuitous sex scenes.  None of that in this movie.  Just a very honest and natural progression in a short-term relationship that both charactures really appreciate.<br />This is just a very good movie.  Perhaps one of the best I have ever seen.  Not sure why it's rated \\"R\\".  Perhaps some of the language but I have heard worse in my son's Jr. High School.<br />Watch this movie and experience a wonderful feeling that you probably haven't experienced in years  or maybe never experienced but want to.  It makes this guy appreciate the woman that I have a little bit more than I did.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the weirdest, most original films that I have seen in a long time! I won't go into detail about the plot, since many other reviewers have already done just that, but I will tell you something else: YOU WILL BE FREAKED OUT! <br />The acting, direction, and musical score are all top notch. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance since \\"October Sky\\", and Jena Malone and Patrick Swayze are great, also. <br />This film is not for everyone, but for those of you who liked \\"Vanilla Sky\\", \\"Memento\\", and \\"Requiem for a Dream\\", this is most definitely a treat! I liked this film a lot!<br />ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!!!!!!
B0000026TD|5.0|This is such wonderful and beautiful album as \\"Down to the moon\\", which I believe is #1 album of all the Vollenweider's. To my knowledge, he used piano for the first time for this unique album giving it freshness and variety. I also think he added sound effect very skillfully and efficiently. I am just amazed how he could do another great job in a row after the grammy awarded \\"Down to the moon\\".<br />So... why don't you let this album be in your precious collection. You won't be sorry at all!!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|It's a great album of live tracks, representative of both her old and new works. For any fan of Sade, this is a refreshing addition to her portfolio. Sade's one of the rare artists out there these days that sound just as good live (if not better) than with the benefit of studio (over)production. A must-buy if you like her music.
B00003CXXP|2.0|This is a retelling of Pinnochio that has great special effects and disturbing emotions. Rather than heartwarming and human, this film is rife with sadness and despair. I'm not advocating a happy ending; the pessimism that comes through the scmaltz is really the issue.  Watch it when you're far away from depressants and you might just come away unscathed.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie was perfect.The 45 minute attack sequence was huge.The romance story is the best one ever written and passed 1997's Titanic.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters Inc. is a good movie but it is the same exact thing as Toy Story with different characters, they should have made Toy Story 3.
B000002KON|5.0|Given my tendency to ramble during reviews, I'll slip into my minimalist mode...<br />Arthur and Village Green are not only the two greatest Kinks albums, they are also two of the greatest Rock albums in the history of the known universe. While Ray Davies went on to write many classic songs, including the exquisite Lola, these two albums probably represent his creative peak. There was simply nobody to touch Ray at this time. He just ruled.<br />Next time they send out a deep space probe containing Earth artifacts, they should include these two albums, as a small sample of the work of one of the greatest musical geniuses this planet has ever produced.<br />It's a pity that his genius has only ever been fully appreciated by the legions of Kinks fans. Still, as the man said, it's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world.<br />So much for minimalism...
B00003CXI1|5.0|I realize this is not a movie on the scale of Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings; it is, however, a very good movie for families to view together. There are not many of those around anymore. The younger actors are new to acting and yes you can tell and some say the scenes are quick but who really goes to a movie to disect it. I went with my 12 yeard old daughter who loved it and the books. She didn't care that the performances weren't Academy Award material. All she cared about was that the movie was very close to the book and it was very entertaining. I myself have seen the movie twice and read all four books. I also have to say that anything that get children back on the road to reading is an instant hit with me. I have never seen my daughter read likes she reads those books. She has also started reading other similar books that she never would have even thought about before.
B00005Y228|5.0|I am a massive Kylie fan!! I have been obsessed with Kylie ever since I went to see her in concert in 1988! (OK- so I was only 8 at the time- but hey!) Her albulm 'Fever' is fantastic and CGYOOMY is only one of Kylie's classic songs. I recommend for anyone who loves Kylie to check out her back catalogue, she has nearly 20 years worth of fantastic songs! My favourites include 'Shocked' 'Better the Devil you Know' 'What Do I have to do' ' Spinning Around' ' Breathe' 'Spinning Around'- the list goes on and on. Anyway well done Kylie for finally making it in America- you guys don't know what you've been missing!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I can't believe this movie completely escaped my attention during it's release in 1992.  In fact, I hadn't even heard of it until about two years ago.  However, after one viewing, it quickly became one of my favorites.  The biggest plus, in my humble opinion, is the cast.  Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice are wonderful leads.  They both possess an intensity that makes for wonderful sparks between the two.  I also love the fact that the character of Fran was not a dressed-down supermodel-type.  Tara does a wonderful job of conveying Fran's determination but, at the same time, her self doubt.  As her confidence and dancing ability evolves, so too does her appearance.  It's such as gradual and completely believable transformation.  It is wonderful to watch Scott's feelings for her also change.  The supporting cast is top-notch too.  Pat Thompson was magnificent as Scott's overbearing mother.  She could sometimes border on viscous but, at the same time, remain somewhat sympathetic.<br />Now for the DVD itself.  I may get raked for this but, as OK as it was, it could have been better.  During the commentary by O'Connol, Martin, and Luhrman, Ms. Martin referred to some scenes that had to be cut before the release of the movie.  I would loved it if they would have included deleted scenes on this DVD edition but they didn't.  And, speaking of the commentary, I really didn't find it too enlightening.  Well, let me put it this way, if you're watching it to get a background on ballroom, and other types, of dancing - then this is the commentary for you.  However, if you're like me and want lots of interesting tidbits on cast, crucial scenes, etc., you'll only find them sparsely placed in between long stories about ballroom training, the history of the Paso Doble, and descriptions of sets.  Even Baz, at one point, had to proclaim it was time to get back to commenting on the movie.  Lastly, since I didn't see the movie during its original release, I would have loved it if they included its original theatrical trailer but it was not to be.<br />Nevertheless, even if this DVD were to come only equipped with the movie itself, it would be a bargain at whatever price it was offered.  If you haven't seen it, watch it!  If you're wondering if you should splurge on the DVD, despite my nitpicky complaints about the DVD edition, I'd encourage it.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minougue is a massive artist!! Her new albulm 'Fever' is only a tiny piece of Kylie's extenssive back catalougue. I am a huge Kylie fan who hails from Scotland and have been a fan ever since I went to see her in concert in 1988!!! (admitedly I was only 8 at the time- but hey)Her smash hit single 'can't get you out of my head' is a classic, but believe me if you think that is good check out Kylie's older hits such as 'Breathe', 'Shocked','Better the devil you know', 'Spinning around' etc etc!! I am so glad that Kylie is finally starting to break through in America- believe me you guys don't know what you've been missing!
B000002J09|3.0|I think that most reviewers of ZOSO are lead to believe that this album is a masterpiece because of Stairway to Heaven (certainly this is one of the best songs ever)and its great sound, however, this is a mediocre album if you compare them to the aggressiveness, creativity and innovation of LZ 1 & 2. I believe that ZOSO was really a warm-up for Houses of the Holy which is a real great album. Black Dog is a heavy blues song normal to LZ, nothing outstanding there. RocknRoll is a [bad] song. The Battle of evermore is nice. Misty Mountain Hop and Four Sticks are awful. Going to California is a good song and the Levee, I don't know what is that.<br />Let's accept the facts: LZ was a very good sounding band but overrated by ZOSO, aside from LZ1, LZ2 and Houses of the Holy, the rest of their catalog is just above average. I see a review that says that this album is better than the Who's Next album, LZ was not a better band than the Who and certainly Who's Next is a more consistent in its playing and the songs.

B00002Z88D|4.0|I would really hate to have Michael Kamen's job.  In front of you you have about 100 musicians who grew up on Beethoven and Mozart and the like, and the only music they will play is what is written on paper in front of them.  Behind you you have a garage band who might be able to read music, but probably have little idea what their music looks like on paper, and they grew up on Motorhead and Danzig and whatnot.  You have a crip clean melodic sound of an orchestra in front of you and a grungy rhythmic sound behind you.  Your job is to make them mix.  Interior designers fear the task of mixing &quot;old&quot; with &quot;new&quot;  Michael Kamen was given the musical equivilent of this task.  Oh yeah, James Hetfield told him &quot;I don't expect an easy listening concert&quot;.  Has anybody ever done this before?<br />And he did it beautifly!  Call of Ktulu, One, Enter Sandman, and Battery were masterpeices!  The orchestra sounded like it should have been there in the first place.  Now the original versions don't seem complete without the countermelodies I hear in S&amp;M.<br />However there are a few songs (particularly metalica's newer songs), where the orchestra didn't sound like part of the band, then it just became extra noise -- it just sounded too busy.  Forgivable - considering that this kind of composition is really unprecedented!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I orginally got this movie for my mother. She forced me to watch it of course, since i bought it for her. well I love this movie! Nichole kidman is great. I love that John L... actor guy more! :) he is funny
B00005OAIE|5.0|...His lyrics speak directly to the world of college & post-college humans...with a sense of humor and joy that is rarely heard ....John Mayer is one of the few credible artists out there that haven't subscribed to the thrashed out, droning beats of the MTV genre.<BR>     There is no doubt, however, that with infectious grooves, memorable lyrics, and inventive songwriting John Mayer will soon enough be seen all over popular culture....when that happens at least we'll have a truly creative, talented voice speaking for us...
B00005QG9J|2.0|not that damn good of a album.only track they have that is good is they're first single off this album and that's it.i regret buying this cd.

B00000AFGM|4.0|This is the first Manson CD i bought. It is a really good cd. Although it is quite different from his previous album it has so much genius put into it. Songs like Great Big White World, Rock is Dead and New Model are pure genius. Others such as The Dope Show and Mechanical Animals are quite catchy. If you're a fan of his Heavier stuff, try this cd anyway. It really, although not as heavy as previous and latter albums, has some great songs.
B000002JS6|5.0|I have long heard of the legendary status of this LP. I also<BR>love this album. But, I must say, that in my mind, Highway to Hell was their masterpiece.
1573222038|4.0|Young Sue Trinder, a denizen of back-alley 1860's London, considers herself most fortunate, raised by the likes of Mrs. Sucksby, a \\"baby farmer\\" who oversees a dilapidated house of \\"fingersmiths\\" (pickpockets) and assorted petty criminals. After all, hasn't Mrs. Sucksby raised Sue as if she were her own daughter? So when Gentleman, a dapper con-artist, appears in the damp and murky kitchen of the house on Lant Street requesting Sue's assistance in a swindle with great potential, who can refuse? Mrs. Sucksby appreciates this opportunity for Sue to make her fortune (half of which will go to Mrs. Sucksby) and seventeen-year-old Sue agrees with a heavy heart, reluctant to leave the only security she's ever known. After rigorous practice as a \\"lady's maid\\", Sue leaves London with Gentleman bound for the quiet countryside, well-rehearsed for her entry into polite society. Her assignment is to please Gentleman's \\"mark\\", the heiress Miss Maud Lilly, and gain her confidence.<br />As with Water's previous novel, AFFINITY, the reader settles willingly upon a spider web as skillful and innovative as any this author has written. Everything seems obvious on the surface, and yet nothing is ever as it first appears. With a firm grip, Waters draws her readers into unimaginable situations, through frightful experiences and harrowing ordeals, only to surface inside-out at the turn of a page. The original shock is delivered at the beginning of the second half of the novel, but from then on, beware. Peopled with villainous \\"gentlemen\\", cruel servants and warped intentions, this is a dangerous world, to be navigated with utmost caution, ready to scream bloody murder. And only Sarah Waters can deliver you safely.
B00005YW4H|5.0|BEAUTIFUL SOULFUL AND SOOTHING VOCALS FROM A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!<BR>These pieces are silky smooth but complex compositions reminiscent of Sade and Raitt but better!<BR>Also recommended: &quot;crystalline silence&quot; by &quot;the quiet mind project&quot; (on mp3.com)
B00005V0X5|5.0|Look - either you're with Megadeth or you're not. You can't be both. Megadeth is 100% awesome in all they do musically. Dave Mustaine is the most talented guitarist of all time. They were great with the first album, and they're great now. End of story.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|I am a big fan of Christina Aguilera but like the majority, I must agree that she does goes overboard with the riffing most of the time but despite those little embellishments I have to admit that this cd is a guilty pleasure. &quot;Christmas Time&quot; and &quot;This Year&quot; are two pop/R&amp;B songs which packs a punch and starts the cd off on a good note (she displays some songwriting skills on the latter but displays great vocal chops on both). My faves on this album are: &quot;These Are The Special Time&quot; (powerhouse ballad with a beautiful message and her voice.......it soars), &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; (Noone has ever done this song in this way, the gospel epilogue is what got me, she moved me soooo much), &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (A Beautiful rendition and the vocal arrangements are commendable). &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; (A Soul sista' fo sho!!)<br />To Sum It Up, it's not perfect but it's definately satisfies my soul and even though her vocal dramatics can turn a listener off from time to time, a true fan will appreciate this effort which I think is on a parr with Mariah Carey's mediocre effort from 1993.

0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential has everything worth watching in a movie: an intelligent and involving script, wonderful acting, three dimensional characters and a conclusion that is not forgone in the first five minutes. It is refreshing to see such great storytelling in a movie. I swear, for a time other movies paled in comparison while I basked in the afterglow. You want a good reason for such high praise? I'll make you a list.<BR>First, the characters. Russell Crowe is Bud White, an LA police officer who is quicker to use his fists than his brain but has no tolerance for woman-beaters. Guy Pearce is an ambitious officer who plays politics with the best, and wants to outshine his policeman father, killed in the line of duty. Rounding out the officers is Kevin Spacey, the press-loving cop who consults on the TV crime drama Badge of Honor. He also makes extra cash tipping off the publisher of a local tabloid. Last is James Cromwell, the smart, politically adept Chief of Police whose force has recently gotten a black eye in the press.<BR>None of these people are very likeable. They are too selfish, too sleazy or too self-righteous to really care about until White's partner is killed in a shooting at a late-night cafe. Each officer becomes involved for his own reasons in tracking down the killers. As the search continues, terrible truths are revealed in the case and our guys face some disturbing truths about themselves. By the end of the film, these characters have changed sufficiently for the audience to accept them and finally really like them. The change is gradual. Never does the character development ever seem artificial.<BR>The second reason to love this film is the story. It is of grand scale with lots of twists, turns and red-herrings. Perhaps a smarter person than I could have figured out how the puzzel fit together before the end, but I did not suspect a thing (which allowed for quite a surprise). <BR>Other reasons to love this film are Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito. Despite the fact that these two characters exist only to be used by others, they have well-rounded parts and are always interesting. Basinger plays a high-class hooker who is probably the most likeable person in the story, despite the fact that, well, she's a hooker. She is intelligent, wise and for the time being accepts her lot in society with a sad kind of grace. DeVito is absolutely wonderful as a sleeze-meister tabloid publisher always looking for 'prime sinuendo'. He plays this scumbag with such glee that it's impossible not to like him. <BR>I could go on and on about why you should watch this, even if you don't normally watch crime dramas. This one has it all. The DVD has plenty of good stuff to justify the extra $, so don't deny yourself such a rare indulgence. Get this movie!
B000002UJQ|1.0|This marked the beginning of the bands, &quot;hey... let's try anything regardless of how obnoxious it is&quot; style.  Just like peanuts and chewing gum, ambience and whining were never meant to be synonymous with each other.  The feelings portrayed in these songs quickly lose their depth when you realize just how pretentious they really are!
B00005B36H|5.0|With nearly 1000 reviews and nearly a year after it's release one might ask why bother writing a review? The answer is simple. This disc is just  so good that it rises and stays above it's contemporaries, way above and deserves as much praise as possible, even 1000 reviews and a year later! If I could add a star I would.  Maynard J. Keenan continues his onslought on his growing legion of fans, with his angst driven lyrics and power  metal that just rocks. The appeal of this disc goes beyond and transcends demographics. For example, this is a disc that my teenage sons and I can both relate to and appreciate. At times it sounds like it could be one of the best bands from the 60's or 70's but make no doubt about it, this is the best of NOW and THEN.The music is of the qualty that will be around for years to come. It is one of those albums that comes around every once in awhile and becomes known as a classic of it's genre.  The musicianship is superb, with technique light years ahead of other metal bands. Complex music that spews dark sweetness, with thunderous driven drum beats creating a polyrhyhmic holocaust, interlocking with progressive chord changes that  mesh with singular purpose, to rock your world!! The disc defies classification, part  head banger music, with screeching , wailing guitar, part mellow introspective melodies, this disc is the best I've heard from ANY rock band in years. It is one of those that can be played over and over. The total package is awesome with each track a standout, most notably \\"Parabola,\\" \\"Mantra,\\" \\"Ticks & Leeches,\\"\\"Reflection,\\" and never mind, each song is classic Tool. If for some reason you've hesitated to get this disc, just get it now, you'll be listening to it alot! As Tool says, \\"This is what you wanted.\\"
B00005RY7X|5.0|Take Queen, Meat Loaf, Nine Inch Nails, and 80's hair metal, mix it up and Andrew WK is what you get. With songs about girls, partying, and the power of rock, it is next to impossible to not be in a good mood after listening to this album. This album is not subtle in anyway. Each song hits explosively from the start and is impossible to ignore. Layered guitars, vocals, synthesizers, drums, and assorted noises come together to form a wall of sound that is unlike anything heard in years. If you are a fan of big sound good time rock and roll with a slice of cheese, this is the album for you.
B00005B36H|5.0|With nearly 1000 reviews and nearly a year after it's release one might ask why bother writing a review? The answer is simple. This disc is just  so good that it rises and stays above it's contemporaries, way above and deserves as much praise as possible, even 1000 reviews and a year later! If I could add a star I would.  Maynard J. Keenan continues his onslought on his growing legion of fans, with his angst driven lyrics and power  metal that just rocks. The appeal of this disc goes beyond and transcends demographics. For example, this is a disc that my teenage sons and I can both relate to and appreciate. At times it sounds like it could be one of the best bands from the 60's or 70's but make no doubt about it, this is the best of NOW and THEN.The music is of the qualty that will be around for years to come. It is one of those albums that comes around every once in awhile and becomes known as a classic of it's genre.  The musicianship is superb, with technique light years ahead of other metal bands. Complex music that spews dark sweetness, with thunderous driven drum beats creating a polyrhyhmic holocaust, interlocking with progressive chord changes that  mesh with singular purpose, to rock your world!! The disc defies classification, part  head banger music, with screeching , wailing guitar, part mellow introspective melodies, this disc is the best I've heard from ANY rock band in years. It is one of those that can be played over and over. The total package is awesome with each track a standout, most notably \\"Parabola,\\" \\"Mantra,\\" \\"Ticks & Leeches,\\"\\"Reflection,\\" and never mind, each song is classic Tool. If for some reason you've hesitated to get this disc, just get it now, you'll be listening to it alot! As Tool says, \\"This is what you wanted.\\"
B000006NXP|5.0|Carlos Kleiber has the extraordinary ability to draw from a score the composer's intentions, coupled with an energy few other conductors have achieved since Arturo Toscanini. This recording on Brahms' Fourth Symphony was no exception.<BR>Most often, conductors attempt to present an heroic mood which, for the most part, is fine, though it pales in comparison to  Kleiber's interpretation, where he keeps a very dark and tragic feel throughout the symphony. Even the C Major Scherzo and the beautiful slow movement only seem to act as time passing, delaying the inevitable tragedy set forth by the first movement and the concluded with the last.<BR>The lyricism of the VPO, the lush sound produced by the strings, and the presence of the winds are very evident in this recording, while control under the reigns held tightly by Kleiber give the piece much suspense, drama, and energy. <br />The first movement is quite lush and lyrical, the strings able to elicit a beautiful sound. The heroism that makes itself present in the second theme is, again, set behind an overall tragic atmosphere, Kleiber giving the feeling of an army bravely facing one twice it's size.<BR>The second movement is quite beautiful and the balancing that Kleiber achieves between the sections is amazing. The horn solos are lovely. It's also very refreshing to hear pizzicato attacks that are together!<BR>The third movement is jubilant, very much in the character of Brahms scherzos in earlier symphonies and Kleiber handles it very well. One can hear the string passages executed cleanly and flawlessly. The energy is everpreseent in this movement and, again using the previous analogy, Kleiber gives the feeling of a brief victory.<BR>The fourth movement is tragic through and through, even during moments of delicate beauty. I personally like this interpretation of the fourth movement, despite Kleiber's tendency to change tempos more often then he usually does, because the Piu Allegro coda actually sounds Piu Allegro. Far too often I find recordings where, though the tempo actually does move faster, the change of phrase from three to a bar to one to a bar prevents the faster tempo from coming through. Here, Kleiber takes it a tempo that feels faster in the new phrase division and gives the coda a climactic drive leading to <BR>a tragic finale filled with a sense of both martyrdom and final despair.<BR>Overall, the recording made by Carlos Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic is exquisite. Though there are a few times where the rhythm and cohesiveness is lost for a few moments, these are only minor flaws. The playing is generally very clean and lush and I'm always happy to hear a thoughtful timpanist and brass section, who never overpower when they aren't neccessary to do so. The balancing is spectacular, every chord is crisp and powerful, and the dynamics are followed to the letter. It's everything that one would want in a Brahms' Symphony No. 4, with the delicacy, drama, and power from the touch of a master like Carlos Kleiber.
B00004YW6I|3.0|I love PJ Harvey and yes I have all her albums, her poster on my wall, tapes of her shows.... yeah yeah you know where this one goes.<BR>BUT this is my least favorite album of hers. Too much love, not that well crafted songs(sorry, she's done better), it just seems like she's headed in the wrong direction on this one(would you like rock star with that?), and well they try to make her look pretty when we all know that Polly Jean is an average looking woman, I think she is beautiful but in an &quot;hey i'm british and live in the country&quot; sort of way. <BR>I want the old angsty, drag queen looking, fisty Polly Jean Harvey back. And the big hair.<BR>Change is good but it has to be good change, ya know what i mean?<BR>(i'm gonna be torched for this one aren't i?)
B00005QFE5|4.0|This movie has a lot going for it.  Good acting, beautiful filming, good story line (romantic, but not cheesy) and other attributes as well.  Eventhough having all of those elements in a single movie is rare, there is something even more striking about this movie that makes it a true accomplishment: a movie with no violence, no sex, no nudity, no profanity or other things you would want to shelter your children from.  While NOT having those things in a movie is an accomplishment the TRULY amazing thing is that this movie is targeted to an adult audience! (that means no cartoons, talking animals or dogs playing sports!) I would imagine that children would be bored to tears with this movie.  The other adults I know that have seen this were equally moved by this fact.  Finally, an intelligent well made movie for adults that leaves out all of the garbage! Highly recommended.
0345409671|1.0|This book is so far fetched, it makes flying pigs seem believable!  What this book should be titled is \\"Anne's Religious Diatribe\\".  From start to finish it is nothing but a theological study.  If I want that, I think I'll buy book about it!  Not a novel which is supposed to be about vampires.  There are horrible inconsistancies in this book.  Vampires are supposedly unable to see spirits (based on what we are told in QotD by Maharet and Jesse) but suddenly in this book Lestat can have an endless (and I DO MEAN endless!) conversation with one.  Vampires who have no interest or professed faith in God commit suicide for no apparent reason over a christian artifact.  And then we have the character of Dora, who is nothing but a Mary Sue so Anne can fantasize about herself ...  This character is so loopy and pointless it's frustrating!  Don't bother with this.  It's not worth the paper it's printed on, and has *nothing* to do with vampires.  Read the first four novels and then stop.  You're not missing anything.
B000002B49|5.0|From Costa Rica. Good to find yourself in the forest of life....maybe I should describe this CD as a trip into my universe, where hope, sadness, religious feelind and solitude are present in diffrent times, but at the end, hapiness come with Boheme chant. Best songs are ohemian, Ballet, Martha Song and Boheme.
B00005UEAR|4.0|This is not your typical Dream Theater (if such a thing exists).  I'm giving this record 4/5 for two reasons:  The Glass Prison, and the title track.  The Glass Prison is an amazing display of angst and power.  Probably the heaviest song Dream Theater has ever put out.  The rest of disc 1 is mellower, still with good musical composition, but not really anything for me to fall in love with, but many people compare some of the songs to Tool and that can't be bad.  The title track (disc 2) is amazing lyrically and musically.  One of the best long format songs I've ever listened to (right up in there with 2112).  It combines many different musical styles and it's ever evolving, making you wonder where did those 42 minutes go when you are done!<br />In short, get this album, it's got something for everyone.  And if you can catch these guys live, you'll have the time of your life.
B000050XEI|5.0|Only Time is just an anthem, related to life. Maybe the best way to describe this CD is that this CD is the best Enya prodct, because it was made with her heart. Sweet November is the movie related to this CD. Touchable movie where the song Only Time, the best in the Enya career has a real meaning, too human meaning to be honest.
B00003CXI0|5.0|When I first saw this movie with my mom, I fell in love with it instantly.  I have already read the books and the movie followed the book exactly.  All the effects, scenary, and characters came together to make this Harry Potter collage [or movie, so to speak].  The bottom line is....this movie is one of the most spectacular movies of all time!  I highly recommend that you should buy this movie.  All I have to say is that this movie is timeless!  BUY IT! IT'S WORTH IT THE MONEY!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I am 25 yrs.old. I have been pretty busy with school and my new job to be into the music scene as I much as I used to be. I don't have cable but I do listen to the radio. It's been awhile since I've bought a CD from new bands and I have yet to figure out how to download music off the internet. <BR>   In January, I went to eat out at Hard Rock Caf and a cousin pointed out Linkin Park to me when their video \\"In the End\\" came on. I stopped and really listened and I was instantly hooked and inspired. It didn't take me long to go out and buy their CD. My musical tastes are pretty tame. I listen to country, pop, classical music soundtracks (John Williams, James Horner, etc.), and alternative. Metal usually gives me a headache and I don't have the appreciation for rap and hip-hop... the slang, the talk about pimps and such... if I am stereotyping, you'll have to forgive me. <BR>   Linkin Park really turned me around. They have all of the above in healthy doses. I've had this CD for about three months now and I still listen to it non-stop. They've gotten me to try and listen to harder music and to start listening to newer music and to go out there and buy it. However, I still cannot find anything I like as much as Linkin Park. <BR>   I like the mixture of Chester and Mike's voices in the songs. It makes the CD more varied. One Step Closer is different than My December, which is different from High Voltage. I also like the mix of rap, rock, electronica and the pop sensibility of the songs. I'll be listening to the songs and suddenly realize that I am hearing an extra beat that I haven't heard before. There is incredible musical detail to some of the songs. \\"In the End\\" is such a great song because it has the haunting piano beats throughout the song that gives it such cohesiveness. My eight -year-old niece loves this song. Every time I watch their DVD, she runs out to watch and sing along. It just has such an incredible melody to it than you can get hooked before too long. Ialso like the way Chester and Mike interweave their voices throughout the song. <BR>    I am not a music expert so I can't say whether or not they are really talented musicians. I believe they have musical integrity and this album is very well done even if it is not quite original. This album seems incredibly sincere and I admire the dedication and effort they put towards trying to write meaningful lyrics in a poetic way without ever resorting to curse words. I am way beyond teen angst but I can definitely relate to anger, frustration, and paranoia. I think they express this in a very healthy way and I love them for that. <BR>   I also went to their concert in February and although they did a lot of cursing on stage, one incidence had me convinced that they love and respect their fans and they are all about love and respect. This makes me not only like their music... I like them. I also found out that these guys are educated guys who take their musical craft seriously and this business serious. They are smart and dedicated. Needless to say, I became a HUGE fan and I hope that they maintain their musical integrity and they deserve to have long and prosperous careers.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I don't care how anyone feels about Russell Crowe personally....to not award him the 'Best Actor' Oscar was amisguided effort by the academy to overlook 'real acting ability.' His portrayal of Mr. John Nash was not only superb, but moving and emotional beyond expression in mere words.What were they thinking????
0375707972|5.0|I have never read a book which made me cry as much as this book. I have also never read such close depiction of what one feels in love. I recommand that everyone reads this book.  It's powerful.
0767819462|1.0|I hated this movie.  I lived the \\"stepmom\\" role.  I currently the \\"ex\\" and my son has to deal with his \\"stepmom\\".  Let's start with the fact that Susan Saradon's character is so far from unreal it is not funny.  She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?  She loses her job over his kids crisis?  The mom doesn't have any friends or relatives that the kids can go to while she is in treatment?  No, she has to go to the woman who lost her son while she was working on a photo shoot. Too silly for words.  Pass on this movie...unless you are looking for the fantasy of how to deal with a family that is not yours.  Also see the Brady Bunch....
0345404475|4.0|Dick is often accused of: weak characters, careless prose, illogical plots. Let's get this issue out of the way at once and say that these charges are often true. In \\"...Electric Sheep\\" I was bugged by Rachael turning from innocent into conspirator between scenes, and by the potential hinted at but then dropped in Deckard's meeting with the other bounty hunter (this idea was eventually realised in the director's cut of \\"Blade Runner\\"). However, this is no reason to dismiss him immediately.<br />It is only after reading \\"...Electric Sheep\\" that I finally \\"got\\" this writer. His books are snapshots of a mind at the point of snapping, as reality collapses all around. This is the persistant feature of his work, and goes some way to explaining his books' imbalances.<br />His stories are obsessive nightmares that play out in his head, rather than conventional realistic narratives. The trappings of reality are present, but in distorted form (in this post-apocalyptic world all the animals are robots, and fallout is gradually rendering the population sub-normal), and, as the story progresses, reality is alarmingly invaded and undermined by dream logic (in this case the real-world appearance of a fictional religious figure).<br />This entropic pattern, reproduced in most of his books, may be due in part to Dick's personal history of hallucination and mental disturbance, but has a wider interest to us: he shows, in allegorical form, how weak is the foundation for our faith in the world's knowableness.<br />(The easiest introduction to Dick's work is probably \\"A Scanner Darkly\\"; for an interesting look at Dick's techniques, see the essay in Stanislaw Lem's \\"Microworlds\\")
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I won't repeat the well-founded criticisms already stated below -- I'll only add that one frame of \\"Singin' In the Rain\\" contains more charm, talent, beauty and feeling than all two hours of \\"Moulin Rouge\\".  And while we're at it, let's put the whole \\"This movie reinvents the movie musical\\" nonsense to rest. This was a P.R. contrivance that worked precisely because the studio could depend on selling this product to a movie-going audience that has absolutely no memory or real knowledge of movie history.  \\"Pennies From Heaven\\" (just to name one example) did everything \\"Moulin Rouge\\" attempted to do, twenty years ago! (and did it better) It's dark, creepy, beautiful, and a masterpiece.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The Moulin Rouge was a nightclub in Montmartre, France outside of Paris. The story is set in the summer of 1899 and continues until 1900. The coreography in this movie is accentuated brilliantly by the excellent costumes that were designed by Catherine Martin. <BR>      <BR>Before this movie, I thought Nicole Kidman was a joke who needed Tom in order to be worth anything- now I see how wrong I was. she came into her own beginning with this movie. Baz Luhrmann's capivating and innovative style plays a major role in this eccentric and lovable movie. Ewan Mc Gregor and Nicole Kidman's voices are astoundingly good and just for the record I recommend the soundtrack as well. The story itself is relatively simple- it is just a story about Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love. Ewan Mc Gregor's portrayal of Christian, the love-struck penniless writer, is absolutely flawless and believable. Richard Roxburgh is absolutely perfect as the overly possesive Duke who desires Satine for himself. Jim Broadbent dazzles as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge. John Leguizamo as the &quot;vice-ridden gnome&quot; Toulouse is genuine as well- I especially like the scenes as the magical sitar. The acting in this movie is what makes it worthwhile. <BR>        <BR>Moulin Rouge is a simple love story told through song. I sincerely recommend it to every person who loves musicals- and even those who don't. The movie boasts music ranging from Nirvana to Elton John to Madonna- it's a sure fire for anyone who has ever listened to music in their life. <BR>        <BR> Moulin Rouge is not for everyone however. The first time I saw Moulin Rouge- I absolutely hated it. Now I've seen it 7 times and I cry each time (this is the first movie I've ever cried in). I urge you to see it again and give it another chance even if yuo despise it- it's definately worth seeing.
B000063CPL|2.0|After generating so much hype with the long awaited reunion with singer Bruce Dickinsn and guitarrist Adrian Smith, which resulted in their best album since 1988s SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON, Maiden fed upon that hype and rapidly released a live album to make some cash....Thats all this album is all about: money. Theres nothing new here, except the fact that Bruce sung two songs fron Blaze Bayleys days, The Clansman and Sign of the Cross.
B000009RC2|5.0|If you didn't hear Mahavishnu when they first came along in 1971, don't worry. Nobody has done anything as boldly original and exciting since that era. I dare you to show me an example that doesn't include names like Return To Forever, Weather Report, Jean-Luc Ponty, or any of the members of those bands. Most of the 80s and 90s were just repackaging of hard rock, bubblegum, and disco.    Just to be honest, I have to admit that I went through a phase in my twenties where I got into punk and new wave, because the energy, style, and attitude of those movements was refreshing after the shallowness of disco and the bombast of arena rock. I still think Elvis Costello produced some of the best pop ever, and I can easily appreciate the no-nonsense, mosh-pit appeal of seminal punks like the Buzzcocks, Black Flag, and the Circle Jerks.    But let's face it--after 1979, jazz and it's bastard brother fusion went into a rapid downhill slide.  Everyone was doing solo albums and trying to develop commercial appeal, and in no time flat there was a complete lack of anything worth listening to. Sure, there are exceptions (McLaughlin's Shakti project comes to mind), but for the most part it was \\"Light's Out\\" jazz and New Age doodling. The jazz traditionalists, meanwhile, struggled to keep a few public stations afloat, playing and replaying swing and bop from decades back. (And they still don't cut fusion any slack.)    Well, I'm here to tell ya, forget whatever you heard about the 1970s. Sure, there was lots of stupid stuff, but it was a very productive and diverse decade. If you are someone who has reached a point in your musical growth where you crave a bit more complexity and virtuosity than you are able to find among the artists of today, take a trip back to the future and discover what the words \\"innovative,\\" \\"progressive,\\" \\"creative,\\"and \\"kick-ass\\" are really supposed to mean.

B00005QK3W|1.0|What was this?  Paul getting into a studio with a bunch of half written songs and then simply repeating the lines over and over and over and over?  <br />There was a time when Paul, or any post-fab-four for that matter, could put anything down on track and people would buy it.  You've got to work harder than (and I quote)&quot;...one, two, three, four, five, let's all go for a drive.  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, let's go there and back again...&quot;  My God, and that was the HIT.  Had planned on going to see Sir Paul in San Jose, but based on this album (the music and his singing...and the fact it'll be about 50% this album)we'll pass.<br />Can I have my money back?
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather has been a great movie standard in America for the past 30 years and will continue to be for a long time to come.If anything,fantastic describes it.Based on the book \\"The Godfather\\" by Mario Puzo.It was directed by Francis Ford Coppola who also directed The Godfather Part Two.Coppola also wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo.The Godfather is a story of Silcilians,organied crime,death,life and family.It is the american dream,full of glory.Marlon Brando stars as the head of the family(Vito Corleone:aka.the godfather).He runs all the buisness and and family.Al Pacino stars as Micheal Corleone and James Caan as Sunny.It is great every time you watch it and is the first fantastic entry in the Godfather Trilogy.
B00005RYKV|2.0|This movie is about a Japanese gangster exiled from his homeland and forced to flee to America. From the moment he sets foot on foreign soil, his orgy of violence and destruction begins. If you're a fan of action and violence, this movie has plenty of both. The film portrays the extremely violent lifestyle of Japanese gangsters. Unfortunately that's about all it has going for it.<br />Much of the time the plot seems disjoint and unconnected. Music is lacking. A lot of the time it was difficult to understand what was going on. I can only recommend this to gangster movie aficionados.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|..sometimes they don't even make good skits either. Why make this film? It is such an obviously bad idea, it makes me wonder if people in Hollywood are ALL crazy. <br />   I was lucky, I watched this movie for free so I didn't waste 10 bucks (well, not lucky really, never watching this mess ever would have been REAL lucky). Nothing is more soul draining than watching an unfunny comedy. The phony accents, the constant mugging for the camera, the bad jokes all contributed to my nausea. Pure torture..
B00005QK3W|4.0|Hmmm. So Paul McCartney is probably the greatest pop songwriter ever. He has been criticized for being lightweight with his lyrics, and has been lauded as the most melodic pop composer. And lately, he's been through very rough times. So what's to expect?. A deep soul searching album revealing his pain?, a collection of pop tunes concealing it?, an experimental effort to show he is not over the hill?. ALL OF THE ABOVE?. It seems. Driving Rain has got all the good and the not so good he is known for. Lonely Road is a fine track, a fine rocker, with explicit lyrics, and the opening bass line itself is worth the tune. From A Lover To A Friend kind of sums up the album, it is sung deep, in pain, but the lyrics are confussing, yet, the bass is great, very very good. She's Given Up Talking is a very good track, not typical McCartney, but it's really interesting, experimental, and it semms he let's the band play on to great advantage. Driving Rain is as catchy as can be, and one does feel compelled to sneer the lyrics, but, hasn't he already said something about Silly Love Songs and the use of worrying?. Ok, he's got a point, so just turn the volume up, and go for a drive (in the rain). I Do doesn't work for me, seems he wasn't too shure about the arrangements, he should have gotten a hold of another producer (perhaps George Martin, even is he's hearing's not good!). Tiny Bubble is, for me, the best song on the entire album, catchy, well sung, well played. Is should be a hit. Magic is the same as I Do. Your Way doesn't cut it. Must have written it on the way to work. He's done it several times to better results. Spinning On An Axis and Back In The Sunshine Again are surprisingly unmelodic and experimental, but the experiment doesn't seem to work. It feels as if he's never going anywhere with them. About You is a great good rocker. Right on it, from the first bar, his voice is great, and the band plays. Go play it loud!. Heather, hmmm, I don't think he can fool anybody withthis. He had the song, Heather walked in, inquired about it, and the man thought: Gosh, I got no songs for her!!!, so, Huh, it's called Heather, dear, for you!. Still, the tune is among his most melodic ever. Beautiful, really. The problem with Your Loving Flame is that he wrote it. If anybody else had done it, it would have been his best, but McCartney can write it in his sleep, so, I 'm not marvelled by it, though I accept it is very good. Riding Into Jaipur is not great but still is very melodic and nice. Rinse The Raindrops is an experiment that works out all right. Let it rip. Freedom is wirtten in Give Peace A Chance form, and it works good. It's great to have Clapton on it too!. So, a couple of experiments, a couple of simple pop tunes, a couple of deeper ones, a couple of McCartney standards. A little bit of everything is not bad at all.

B00005R87Q|4.0|Lifting the plot directly from Point Break (1991), The Fast and the Furious is a turbo-charged ride with hot women, outrageous stunts, loud cars, and an equally loud soundtrack. Director Rob Cohen seems to be playing it safe relying on the sure-fire formula of said girls and cars after the critically-mauled The Skulls(2000). And the film indeed does work well with all the elements that make a no-brainer movie like this a winner with audiences. Vin Deisel makes a stand-out performance as the main man of the late-night drag racing, and Michelle Rodriguez provides enough eye candy for all the pre-pubescent boys. The story, as it is, is basically the same as Point Break, with Paul Walker as an undercover cop attempting to infilltrate the late-night speeders, then joining theit unique culture. The sub-plot involving gangsters fells like it's been tagged on to create more of a plot, but who cares? Rob Cohen knows what audiences want in an action flick like this, and it suceeds admirably. Turn up the volume, set your brain to half-mode and this is a winner.
0380730367|5.0|I was recently turned on to Dennis Lehane through an article written by Nora Roberts.  He's one of her favorites.  I already am a devotee of her \\"In Death\\" series, and was not disappointed in this recommendation.  After I read \\"A Drink Before the War\\", I was so enthralled by the quality of the writing and the characters, I proceeded to my nearest library and read the rest of the books in succession.  These books are terrific escapist reading, and Dennis Lehane is one terrific writer.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Originally a Stanley Kubrick project, A.I Artificial Intelligence is a wonderfully-crafted masterpiece. Steven Spielberg's translation of Kubrick's vision is the most astounding film I saw in 2001 (The release date is a nice homage to Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968).<br /> A film that has to be seen 2 or 3 times to uncover all the hidden gems, A.I is a spectacular journey into the future, where robots (or \\"mechas\\" as they are said in the film) are human-like in their daily lives and can do things that surpass what any human could ever do. And this brings us to Jude Law as the love mecha Gigolo Joe. His excellent performance was shamefully overlooked at the Academy Awards, as was Haley Joel Osment as David. John William's music in the film is one of his best scores, as it furthers the emotional pull of the story.<br />The CGI in the film is seamlessly intercut with live action and creates a fantastic visionary feel to the film, reminisant of Blade Runner (1982). The most impressive creation in the film however, is the supertoy \\"Teddy\\". Like the story of Pinnochio, from which the main storyline is based, Teddy is David's \\"adviser\\" and him and Gigolo Joe set off on a journey of discovery as David tries to find the mystical \\"blue fairy\\" who can make robots into real boys.<br />The three sections to the film are very different, going from the suburban home of David's parents to the shocking \\"flesh fair\\" where robots are destroyed on stage in front of audiences. Then to Rouge City where the Kubrickian side of the film is in full bore, as we are greeted by a city composed of garish neon lights adorning a spectacular world of sex and depravity. The jumps from these very different worlds is sometimes unsettling, and may not sit well with some people. And the extended ending seems over-wrought, but on the whole, it is a masterful excercise in film making at it's finest.
6305252521|5.0|There were rumbling at Paramount Studios in the weeks before the release of The Truman Show. Word was that they knew they had one of the best movies of the year, but feared they had not come up with the right promotional campaign. When I heard this news, I crossed my eyes. How often have we heard that before? <br />After seeing it, I admitted that they were right to worry. Truman Burbank is no ordinary hero, and the picture is even more extraordinary. It is enormously entertaining and strikingly insightful, but it belongs to no known genre. <br />As a society, we have a compulsion to pigeonhole everything. The Truman Show has been labeled a comedy, a drama and a combination of both. I think it has elements of the best science fiction, which is a story that has never happened, but which conceivably could. Call it what you will. This movie is easily one of the Ten Best Films of 1998. I wouldn't be surprised if it won Best Picture at the Oscars. <br />Suppose a television producer were able to create a TV show in which the life of a person was recorded from his birth on. This is the fate of Truman Burbank, brilliant played by Jim Carrey. I've never been caught up in Carrey Mania, but I've usually enjoyed him. My reservation about him has been that, while he is above average in talent, he's previously seemed to play his characters as impersonations of them. The Truman Show is all the proof I need that he can be a true actor. I found myself believing in Truman, not in Jim Carrey as Truman, and that's a tribute to the actor.<br />We are introduced to Truman at the point where the show, now in its 30th year, is starting to unravel. The subject of this massive TV show, which runs 24 hours a day, lives in the world's largest set, a domed structure that must be five miles across. During the opening credits, we are given a quick history of the show. After that, the first scene shows one of the set's five thousand cameras crashing to the ground. It lands just a few feet from the startled Truman. I think he has known for a long time that his world is somehow wrong. Every attempt to leave, for example, has been thwarted. The shattered camera is the first piece of concrete evidence. Since all the other people in town, including his wife and his friends, are actors, there is not much they can do to help him. This behavior merely reinforces his suspicions. <br />I don't think I have ever seen a film this short cover so many issues coherently or operate smoothly on so many levels. You can be merely entertained by it, or you can think about the issues it raises, concerning everything from a society that has become totally voyeuristic to the blurring of what is real to the results of our feeble attempts to play God. If you dare, you might consider the notion that, as a group, we are in danger of entertaining ourselves to death. <br />Don't let the above paragraph put you off. The real magic of The Truman Show is its ability to gratify viewers no matter what level they approach it from. <br />.
B000003N7K|5.0|I bought the CD because I knew of John Coltrane, one of the greatest sax men, never heard much of Hartman except on Satelite music once in awhile. Well, the combination of these two on this disc is outstanding, and the song selection is the greatest. You won't find chemistry like this any where between a voice and an instrument, I promise you. It is one of my &quot;most played' and I never expected it to be.
6305263248|3.0|In ancient Japan, a ronin was a samurai warrior whose master had been killed in disgrace. When this happened, the ronin lost his reason for being a soldier and often began a career as a hired assassin or mercenary. This bit of history acts as a metaphor for the characters in the film, Ronin.<br />Robert de Niro is Sam, a middle-aged former CIA agent who, claiming to be broke, takes a job with a mysterious group in France. In Paris he meets the rest of the team. They include Vincent [Jean Reno], an ex French espionage agent, and Diedre [Natascha McElhone], who is in charge of the group and who was probably a major player in the IRA. The mission is to steal a package from another group, which is apparently manned with other former agents. The metaphor quickly begins to unfold. Like those ancient ronins, these people were fighters in causes that have ceased to exist. The difference is that their masters were political ones. They now double-cross and double deal for no noble purpose.<br />In true thriller style, neither we nor the gang members are privy to the contents of this package. The contents become almost beside the point, as we watch these cynical, disenchanted characters chase after something they are willing to kill for. It's what they were trained to do, and that's what they do, even now that their reasons are vague, if not nonexistent. <br />There are many good things about Ronin. I do not entirely agree with the general critical consensus that this is a grand return to days of stylish, inventive movie thrillers. True, there is no reliance on computerized special effects. It does contain two of the most spectacular car chases ever put on film. De Niro, as can be expected, is head and shoulders above the average modern anti-hero. But hasn't he always been better? Currently, as shown by him in Wag the Dog, Jackie Brown and this movie, he is in his deeply cynical phase. Expect him to mellow out in a few years. <br />It is great to see 69-year old director JohnFrankenheimer back in the genre that made him famous. Two of his movies, The Manchurian Candidate [1962] and Seconds [1966], are two of the greatest thrillers ever made. But Ronin, while retaining essence of his earlier work, displays some unpleasant modern traits. Traditionally, the great car chases, as well as those on foot, have taken place in crowded cities or on busy highways. This heightens the suspense. The prototype of the modern chase was created in a brilliant 1969 film called Bullet. In it, cars careened around in a most spectacular setting - the streets of San Francisco. The ones in Ronin take place in the twisting streets of European cities, but unlike their predecessors, Ronin's characters manage to kill a number of innocent bystanders in the process. In real life, that's exactly what would happen, but this realistic approach backfires. I was disturbed by the fact that none of these deaths were ever referred to either in the film or by anyone I know who saw it. Movies about morally corrupt characters are acceptable, but it seems to me that some film makers today assume the audience is also corrupt. Surely, that's a fallacy on their part.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I loved this movie!  Anthony Hopkins is by far my favorite  actor.  He made us fall in love with Hannibal Lecter, even after we knew what he did.  Although it was kinda far-fetched from the book, which I encourage anyone to read if they loved the movie(same goes with Silence of the Lambs)it was still just as moving.  If your a hardcore romantic, who likes to find romance in anything, I suggest this movie.  You will be scared to death and touched at the same time!
078401213X|5.0|It's often said that movies are an art form, and I really believe it's true. We often lose sight of this idea. Movies are a driving force in entertainment. If a film is poorly done, we quickly realize it. We can think of such movies as celluloid equivalents of drawing stick men or happy faces. Others really entertain us, yet we rarely consider the art of how these were done. When a movie like Titanic costs $200,000,000, the implication is that throwing money at a project is all it takes. In fact, it takes a genius to work successfully on such a large canvas. <br />At the other end of the spectrum are pictures such as Pi. These are works by talented filmmakers who, so far, have limited reputations and even less money. The cost of a score of these films costs less than the publicity campaign of one major studio release. In this low budget area, we often find true artistry, simply because lack of funds makes innovation a necessity. While the results are not always successful, the effort is always there.<br />Pi, the story of brilliant mathematician whose work drives him to insanity, succeeds brilliantly. Filmed in black and white on location in Manhattan, it's a \\"X files\\" story of patterns, visions, covert operations, crashing computers, and Creation itself. Based on science theory rather than science fiction, it is frightening because it is possible. <br />It has long been accepted that the Universe might be understood through mathematical equations. What Pi suggests is that the obsessive pursuit of such knowledge could drive someone to insanity. I suspect that it would, perhaps because it would make one so different and apart from the rest of humanity. As Sol, Sean Guilette gives a first-rate performance. It's often hard to have empathy for a character this obsessive and humorless, but Guilette manages to involve us, even when we've no idea where Sol is coming from. <br />Director Darren Aronofsky, like others before him, may have set his career in motion with this little seen movie. His co-writer, Sean Gullette, is also Pi's star. The techno-industrial music by Clint Marsel is a rare example of a film's score being an integral part of the plot. This music, along with tight editing and good acting, causes some scenes to become so intense that you almost feel what the main character is feeling.<br />For those viewers who like to step outside the mainstream, Pi is highly recommended.

0783232039|3.0|I've come to dread most sequels. Not only are they usually inferior, they also raise the question of just how much originality is squashed by a Hollywood mentality that is often way below that of the audiences they are after. There are exceptions. Aliens was at least as good as Alien. I'd be hard pressed to say which film in the Godfather trilogy is the best. <br />Bride of Chucky is the fourth installment in a series that started with Child's Play in 1988. Admittedly the original was no classic, but this latest movie is at least as good. The first film was a rather clever little horror film in which a serial killer used a voodoo spell which, after he was gunned down, allowed him to inhabit a child's doll. The doll looked innocent and ridiculous, but the terror lay in the idea of an inanimate object's coming to life. I have this fear about my computer.<br />Bride of Chucky is played for laughs, which is why I enjoyed it. This choice, however, may have contributed to its boxoffice failure, because it is perhaps a bit too sophisticated in tone for its target audience. It's a comedy, folks! <br />It begins when Chucky's old flame Tiffany, played with finesse by Jennifer Tilly, bribes a cop into stealing the tattered remains of Chucky, the doll, from the police evidence room. Unfortunately for the policeman, Tiffany is quite the murderess herself, and he's taken his last bribe.<br />Tiffany whisks Chucky off to her trailer home, and reading from \\"Voodoo for Dummies\\", she brings him back. He now looks like a little Frankenstein, because Tiffany had to sew him back together again. One thing leads to another. Both have very short fuses, and while Tiffany is relaxing in the bath and watching The Bride of Frankenstein on TV, Chucky tosses the set into the bathtub. The electrocuted Tiffany is now Tiffany, the doll. <br />Meanwhile, there are the prerequisite teenage lovers, Jade and Jesse. For reasons never explained, Jesse lives in a big mansion with her uncle, the local Chief of Police. Maybe bribery is big time in this town. Jesse, who's a swell guy, lives in the same trailer park as Tiffany. Naturally, uncle does everything to break them up, and he's got the badge to help him do it. <br />Chucky tell Tiffany that he can make them human again, if he can get to where his body is buried in New Jersey. Tiffany points out that they are somewhat too small to drive. This is where Jade and Jesse get involuntarily involved. <br />As you'd expect, there's a body count in the movie. But Bride of Chucky is only mean-spirited in the sense that it is a dark comedy. Our doll couple are both psychotic, and no one knows it better than they do. They laugh at their own madness, because they know it's just the way they are. <br />I didn't plan for this to sound like a rave review. The movie is a low budget piece of entertainment, but it is a whole lot better than most such flicks.
0790729644|2.0|I finally saw this highly touted film last night. Incredibly boring! Forget this and get High Plains Drifter. HPD has the same moral lesson as TU (Violent men may be temporarily needed to re-establish civilization when the cowardice of other men forfeited it), but it is a much more interesting and compelling film. BTW, why see Hackman's sherrif as corrupt. He is flawed to be sure, but his situation-specific violence has lead to establishment of a peaceful civilized community for women and families.
6305265666|4.0|When I heard that Drew Barrymore, ex-addict and former all around bad girl, was going to star in a reworking of Cinderella, I decided that her much publicized recovery had gone too far. She had become a child star in that famous fairy tale know as E.T, and I saw no way for this worldly young woman to return to that genre. I was wrong.<br />Ever After is a delight. It's not a masterpiece. It has some structural flaws. But the thoughtfulness and hard work that went into make it a fine entertainment. And Barrymore shows again that she has her famous family's genes. <br />This movie makes a number of changes to the children's classic. Most of them work, and all are intended to update the story. Barrymore's Danielle [Cinderella] is not the helpless victim of the original tale. She's a bright, feisty girl whose had some bad breaks in life and is trying to make the best of them. The always wonderful Anjelica Houston, who can play every thing from comedies [The Addams Family] to thrillers [Prizzi's Honor, The Grifters], portrays the stepmother, Rodnilla, as a miserable, ambitious woman. She's mean-spirited, but hardly evil incarnate. When her husband dies early in the film, her grief seems as genuine as his daugher, Danielle's. Even the stepsisters have changed. Neither are ugly. One is ordinary looking and is secretly appalled at the way Danielle is treated. The other is beautiful to look at, but as heartless as they come on the inside. <br />One of the best changes is in the social outlook. Many fairy tales are basically about impoverished characters in a country that oppresses the poor. They wind up marrying a member. The irony is that they become a member of the group that oppressed them, and once in, they appear to do nothing for the people they let behind. They are too busy living happily ever after. I always felt this sent a not-so-moral lesson to children.<br />In Ever After, Danielle is less than impressed when she meets Price Henry [Dougray Scott]. He is witty andhandsome, but it is his father, after all, who has made life so miserable for the commoners. Henry gives no indication that he will be much different. Their second meeting happens only because Danielle must save a servant who has been taken away in lieu of the family's back taxes. She then finds out that he does have a heart and a brain, and that his attitude is a result of his never having know any life but a royal one.<br />The movie is done with a fine sense of humor. The dialog is very well written, and the cast delivers their lines with gusto. The sets and the costumes are delightful, with the exception of Danielle's ball gown, which is decidedly a dangerous fashion statement. I think it was designed as an inside joke.<br />The problems with plot structure are fairly minor. A pointless subplot was added to the beginning and the end of the film. At times, the effort to remake the story clashes with an odd tendency, at times. to try to be faithful to the original.
B000002UB3|5.0|definetely the beatles at their best! i'm 16 now, and abbey road was the first cd i bought by the beatles 2 years ago. i only bought abbey road because i had heard the song &quot;because&quot; in the movie american beauty and loved it, not because it was by the beatles. i didn't really become a fan of the beatles until a few months later when i bought rubber soul-and THAT was it for me. when i first listened to all of abbey road i immediately loved it and couldn't stop listening to it. it's very modern, ahead of their time-you wouldn't think it was from 1969 if they remarketed and put it on mtv(same thing with revolver). two years later the beatles are my favorite band and abbey road remains my favorite album by them, every song artistic and unique. i strongly recomend beginning beatle fans to buy this as their first beatles album, because it truly symbolizes how great and legendary the beatles really are! then buy rubber soul and revolver and be prepared to go thru full beatlemania!
0767812387|3.0|The people who made Dance With Me missed the beat. It's not a bad movie. It's entertaining enough, but you'd expect the whole point of it to be contained in the title. At ninety minutes, it would have been a high energy look at hot Latin dancing. Instead, it runs over two hours, and for some reason, devotes a lot time to a predictable, unoriginal story line. <br />Puerto Rican heart throb Chayanne, whose real first name is Elmer, plays a young Cuban named Rafael. When his mother dies, he contacts a man named John [Kris Kristofferson] in Texas who his mom always claimed was the father. Rafael is the result of a ship board romance, and while John invites Rafael to come to America, he does not know it's his son who will arrive. <br />Rafael becomes the maintenance man at John's run down ballroom dance school. There he meets gorgeous, talented and intelligent Ruby Sinclair [Vanessa L. Williams], who is an instructor. It's love at first sight for Rafael, but Ruby has been burned by love once too often and has an illegitimate son to prove it. <br />The school is peopled by odd ball characters, who are practicing for a national championship in Las Vegas. They spend much more time batting uninspired one-liners back and forth than they do preparing for the contest. The exceptions are Ruby and one other woman. <br />Will John follow through on his plan to close the school? How will he react when he finds out Rafael is his son? When will Ruby get over her pride and fall for Rafael? Will our Cuban hero ever get to dance? Will he ever stop smiling?<br />The predictable story might have been fine if its delivery had been energetic. Director Randa Haines chose to keep the pace of it slow, which conflicts with the dance sequences. They make the movie come alive. There are three show stopping numbers, and for someone like me who likes dancing, they are worth the price of the video rental. Otherwise, the only interesting bit to me was watching Rafael and Ruby come to terms with eachother over what defines dancing. Both their styles are terrific, but his is of the streets, while hers is of the classroom. This is the first movie I've seen which shows that two people may be dancers, but that doesn't mean they can dance with each other.<br />One great dance routine comes early in the movie. Rafael burns up the dance floor at a Latin disco in Texas. The rest come at the end during the ballroom competition, where couples doing the Rumba, the Samba, the Cha Cha and the Tango show us couch potatoes that we may be missing a lot in life. There's about an hour between the first and last dance numbers, and this is where the movie really drags.
B00005JKZQ|2.0|... With every subsequent comedy De Niro has made, I've gone to the theatre to have my hopes dashed again and again. With Showtime, De Niro has hit a new low, and I am just about ready to give up on him.<br />The biggest problem with this movie is the complete lack of focus. The movie could have worked as a parody of reality TV and various other cop genre. It could have worked as a Hollywood cop thriller with the quintessential wise-cracking rookie paired with the hard-bitten older detective. It could have been a Naked Gun joke-a-second comedy. Instead, it's a little bit of all three, and it ends up being not good at anything in particular.<br />The most interesting character in this movie are Vargus, the criminal, and Powder, the dog. De Niro and Murphy phone in their performances. I know there's a great actor and a great comedy somewhere in De Niro, but I'm getting tired waiting for him to get his act together.

B00000BKE0|3.0|When talking about \\"No Prayer For the Dying,\\" there tend to be two camps of Iron Maiden fans. There are those who hate the album, claiming that the songs are the weakest of Maiden's career and that it was the turning point in the band's career, when they went from embodying the greatness of the NWOBHM to being a shadow of what they were, prompting Bruce to leave the band. Then, there are those who love the album, praising it as a return to Maiden's \\"classic\\" sound after the synth-driven \\"Somewhere In Time\\" and \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\\"<br />In truth, \\"No Prayer For the Dying\\" is neither. It is the most mediocre album that Iron Maiden have ever produced. It's far better than any of the travesties that followed it (\\"Fear of the Dark,\\" \\"The X-Factor,\\" and \\"Virtual XI\\") but nowhere near as good as anything that preceded it (or \\"Brave New World,\\" which was Maiden's true return to form). New guitarist Janick Gers proved himself an ample replacement for Adrian Smith, though he would later show that his skills as a songwriter were significantly weaker than H's. \\"No Prayer\\" has its share of decent tracks, but the songs as a collection were nowhere near what Maiden is capable of.<br />Make no mistake, \\"No Prayer\\" suffers from many, many weak songs. \\"Holy Smoke,\\" a rant against televangelists, is a rather stupid premise for a Maiden song; \\"Bring Your Daughter . . . to the Slaughter\\" is a poor song (the original version of the song, found on Bruce's solo \\"Best Of...\\" album, is far better) which suffers from a ridiculous title; \\"Hooks In You\\" is a poor addition to the \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" series (especially following the masterpiece \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\" from \\"The Number of the Beast\\"); \\"The Assassin\\" has a lame, repetitive chorus (that said, musically, it's a decent song); and the title track is just a generally weak tune.<br />However, the good songs on this album are REALLY good. \\"Tailgunner\\" follows in the tradition of \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and \\"Aces High\\" as a classic Maiden fighter pilot song. \\"Fates' Warning\\" and \\"Public Enema Number One\\" are both strong tracks (despite \\"Public Enema\\"'s unfortunate title), as is the epic-sounding \\"Mother Russia.\\" The true highlight of the album, however - a song that should rightfully have become one of Maiden's all-time classics - is the maritime battle-themed \\"Run Silent, Run Deep.\\" Building on a strong melody and one of Maiden's all-time top guitar solos, \\"Run Silent...\\" should have fit seemlessly into the canon of classic Maiden, yet somehow never received a place of honor on any of Maiden's live albums or their greatest hits collection.<br />Die-hard Maiden fans need to own \\"No Prayer For the Dying,\\" if only to fill out their collections. More casual fans may want to find a way to listen to the songs I mentioned as being good before they make a decision on the album. \\"No Prayer For the Dying\\" may indeed have been the beginning of the end for Iron Maiden. But if songs like \\"Tailgunner\\" and \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" are what a band is capable of doing at its weakest, that's a pretty good indication of what Maiden can do at their best.

Hemingway does a wonderful job with the images in his book, from the brown of Jordan's uniform to the dust of the innumerable towns of Spain, everything is tightly written.

Truly Hemingway is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and FWTBT is irrefutable evidence.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Artificial Intelligence is most importantly NOT an appropriate children's movie. It's a very serious social commentary, and is also most<BR>profound, and very frightening, relative to the birth of the contemporary technology of today.

The only two nominations that it received were for <BR>best film score &amp; special effects. I still can not believe that<BR>it did not only pick up even one Acadamey Award, The special effects one, that it lost to: Lord of The Rings. But was ultimately panned by the Acadamey &amp; the film community.

It is the perfect mix of fantasy, a potentially real future reality, and incorporates the innocence<BR>and horror of a child, with it's important cross reference to the<BR>story of Pinocchio. To those who complain about it being too complex, My response is simply that it was meant to be complex.<BR>This film is not light material, by any standard. It is as deep, as deep can possibly be.

B000002B1M|4.0|\\"It Was Written\\" the 2nd drop from Nas is complete but not what everyone expected. Few found this album to be better than the beyond classic \\"Illmatic\\" but for the most part most of us found this is to be below the 1st masterpiece.<br />There is no doubt \\"It Was Written\\" is solid and worth the money you pay for it by far. I think it is unfair to expect an even better album after you have already dropped an album that can't be improved. (Same happened with GZA/Genius with the \\"Liquid Swords\\" to \\"Beneath the Surface\\") With that said I have to give Nas a lot of credit for a nice try at coming out hard with his 2nd album. <br />Nas has the ability to drop classic cuts and he proves this with a handful of tracks on \\"It Was Written\\" such as \\"The Message\\" \\"Street Dreams\\" \\"I Gave You Power\\" \\"Take It In Blood\\" \\"Black Girl Lost\\" and \\"If I Ruled the World.\\"<br />Then again Nas proved he can drop mainstream material. That is the major downfall on this album. Tracks such as \\"Watch Dam Niggaz\\" and \\"Nas Is Coming.\\"<br />On \\"It Was Written\\" Nas transformed from the Nasty Nas to Escobar. Big mistake. The street poet still comes hard and blessed hip-hop with a nice album but could have been much better.<br />Lyrically, Nas comes correct but not as well as he proved with \\"Illmatic.\\" On the production tip, there is serious downfall. The production is nice, but after hearing \\"Illmatic compared to \\"It Was Written\\" you can see the difference that shames this album. <br />Compared to Nas' other albums \\"I Am\\" and \\"Nastradamus\\" this album is much better, deeper lyrics and darker production. I find that the recent drop from Nas \\"Stillmatic\\" should have been more compared to \\"It Was Written\\" and not \\"Illmatic.\\" It is obvious Nas is on the same level with \\"It Was Written\\" when he dropped \\"Stillmatic.\\" <br />If you are a Nas fan you already have this, if you like the \\"Stillmatic\\" material then you would feel this also unless you are the TRL watching type then stay away.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Rufus is amazing -- the most unique voice and beautiful music.  I am absolutely addicted to this cd.  Poses and The Tower of Learning have been stuck in my head...singing those two songs along with the cd is a transcendant experience.  If you are a fan of quality singer/songwriters, you must meet Rufus.  This cd is a must have.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I learned about the stage production when it opened in NYC years ago and thought often about it since.  When I saw the movie, I had to have it.  It's better than I thought it could be.  Additionally, the DVD has lots of bonus material, including an 80 minute feature on the show.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|SESSION 9 is a terrific, atmospheric, haunting, dream-like pscyhological thriller with a unique setting:  the real-life Danvers Insane Asylum in Massachussets.  A five-man team of asbestos removers is tasked to rid the abandoned, maze-like building of asbestos in just one week.  Adding to the pressure of this seemingly-impossible job are the personal demons of each of the men working there.  Slowly, the evil influence of the Asylum, as well as the aforementioned personal issues of the men lead to a horrific turn of events.  Will any of the men live to tell about their week at the asylum?  Is there something sinister there, or is one or more of them insane? Therein lies the hook of the movie.<br />Let me just say this right now.  If you're a fan of \\"cutesy\\" horror, then Session 9 is not for you.  When I say \\"cutesy\\" horror, I mean horror that involves 1)self-aware teenagers or young adults spouting dialogue that sounds like it was penned by Kevin Williamson, 2) a slasher wearing a ghostmask/parka/rain slicker/fisherman's hood/fencing mask/cherub mask/whatever, and 3) at least one or two faces on hiatus from the WB Network.  In other words, everything that followed SCREAM (SCREAM's success was really a double-edged sword: on one hand it revived the horror genre.  On the other hand, we will probably have to suffer putrid, self-aware SCREAM rip-offs until the end of the world.  I don't know whether we should celebrate Kevin Williamson, or slap him silly) <br />SESSION 9 is, at the risk of sounding like a snob, a thinking-person's horror movie.  Many things are open to interpretation.  The pieces form different puzzles at different times.  At the best of times, all you have are suspicions and fears, nothing known for sure.  If you like SCREAM and it's progeny, this movie will frustrate the living heck out of you.  But if you like films like THE SHINING and DON'T LOOK NOW, where the pace is deliberately slow to lull you into a sense of unease and dread, where seemingly benign environments gradually morph into treacherous and terrifying wastelands, where even after the film has ended, you are looking over your shoulder because, without realizing it, the film has gotten under your skin, if you like all these things in a movie, then SESSION 9 is for you.  <br />My hat is off to Brad Anderson and Steve Gevedon (the writers of SESSION 9--ANderson also directed, while Gevedon also acts).  In a perfect world, their SESSION 9 would have been the one to revive the horror genre, and not Kevin Williamson's SCREAM.  But as we all know...
B00005T33W|2.0|I heard so many raves about this movie, but I found it to be very slow. And the one thing good that Enid seemed to be doing was getting Seymour a love life with the beautiful and kindly Dana. And then Enid sabotages that by sleeping with Seymour. (Why Seymour would forgo beautiful Dana to sleep with short, dumpy and obnoxious Enid I have NO idea.) I really thought this had so many flaws, I can't recommend it at all.
B00004TJLD|1.0|This is one of my favorite albums and after the re-engineering work on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and The Eagles' Hotel California and ELP's Brain Salad Surgery I was prepared for something special by one of the premiere producers of all time.<br />Boy was I dissapointed. This disk (we're talking about the DVD-Audio) is nothing more than a 24 bit transfer of the master tape. Not DTS, not Dolby Digital, nuthin'! I listened to the CD and this disk on the same equipment and could tell way too little difference to warrant the expense. Save your dough.<br />And shame on you A. P. Get off your duff and remix this for 5.1 or stay out of the DVD-Audio market. This is very deceptive. At the very least make sure the sound quality is so much better that the price is justified.
B000063CPL|5.0|This is a 'must-have' album! Who says that Bruce lowered his voice through the years? He has never been better live. Incredible sound! Nicely mixed and edited, it is one of the best concert albums ever. At least, I don't remember listening to a better one. Now we should stop praising 'Live after Death', because this album is going to become legendary. I really believe so! 'Rock In Rio' challenges Metallica's symphony album, not to mention that the difference between James Hetfield's and Bruce's singing abilities can only be measured in light years!
B000002UAX|5.0|In the history of Rock and Roll music, no other band or individual has ever released a collection of songs with as much diversity as the Beatles did with the White Album in the Fall of 1968. With 30 tracks and a running time of about 94 minutes, the Beatles White Album is a brilliant reminder that no rock and roll act has ever been as good, past or present. By 1968, the Beatles could write music in literally any musical genre that they wanted to and pull it off with often amazing results. From folk leanings on this record there is Blackbird, Mother Natures Son, Rocky Raccoon, and Julia. When the Beatles attempted hard rock the results were, Helter Skelter, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey. With Pop music the White Album offers Obladi-Obladi, Martha My Dear, and Sexy Sadie. With classic rock, this records offers Birthday, Dear Prudence, I'm So Tired, Back in the USSR and Happiness is a Warm Gun. With country music the Beatles try and succeed with Don't Pass Me Bye. When its ballads, the Beatles treat the listener to the lush Good Night and when the Beatles take a turn at writing an old school show tune the result is the entertaining Honey Pie. Also, let's not forget the blues with the slow version of Revolution contained here and the classic Yer Blues. Good luck in trying to find another musical act that can deliver this kind of diversity that is around today. This album is why we record music and sell it to people folks, to preserve greatness. Buy this album!
0006531407|4.0|This book was the first survival book that I got.  It didn't leave my side for weeks, until I had read it cover to cover.  Now that I'm a little older, wiser, and more critical, I have noticed some faults.  There are millions of feral cats in australia, there are about half a dozen different types of deer in australia and a tiger snake doesn't look like the illustration provided.  That makes me wonder what else isn't correct, but I still think that its a great book though.  Packed full of useful information, and fairly detailed instruction for a lot of things you can do in your own shed or varandah.  It'll keep you entertained for ages.
B000002BPS|4.0|This is the last of true Offspring,  though americana and Conspiricy of one have some good songs they don't compare to smash and this one. Ignition is pretty consistent, but I didn't really like their self titled first album.  The Best songs on the album are 7. Gone away(the best offspring song!!), 11. way down the line, 13. Amazed, 14. change the world, 4. Me and My old lady, and 2. The Meaning of life.  the rest is just filler, but good filler.  No album they make will ever compare with Smash but this one is damn close.
6303921248|2.0|Geesh...I know Austen fans love this adaptation of the novel. My own wife watched the whole thing. I however could not force myself to suffer through the constant supercilious preening and exclaiming of the women. If women were truly like this back then...then I am deeply thankful I was born into this era. I do not feel the over the top depiction of the women does justice to Austen's insightful and humorous novel. Indeed.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I had the original release of this album back in the day. I lost it somewhere after moving out of my Mom's house, and I was peaked when I found it on CD. It had been 14 years since I heard it and when I listened to the CD, it brought back a lot of very cool memories!<br />This is a band at its very best. This is definitely one of the best live albums ever, in the same category of Cheap Trick's \\"Live at Budokan\\", \\"Foghat Live and Peter Frampton \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\".<br />Any fan of the '70s style of music should listen to this album...then buy it. You will not be sorry!!
B00005T30L|5.0|been alienated?  had people mad at you?  just have a bad day where there seems to be no end?  then this is the movie for you.  its mostly about Enid and her summer of fun and discontent.  it's also a nice movie to watch when you're depressed because the underlying moral of the story is:  there will never be a constant in your life except yourself.  you're all you've got to rely on.  everyone has bad days-you just have to figure out how to get around them.
B000060OWV|5.0|Robben Ford has been extremely busy over the last couple of years. Since his 1999, release \\"Supernatural\\", he has released the 2001, \\"Paul Butterfield Tribute\\", the 2002, \\"Jing Chi\\" CD with Vinnie Colaiuta and Jimmy Halsip and now, \\"Blue Moon\\", which, like \\"Jing Chi\\" also features Colaiuta on drums. Robben Ford has also dropped his label in favor of Concord Records and, for those guitarst out there, his Fender RF model guitar in favor of a Fender Telecaster. The result? Robben's most exciting release in years. <br />Ford's blues fans will be happy to know that despite Ford's earlier Jazz releases and Concord Record's focus on some formidable jazz artists such as the Rippingtons, Herb Ellis, Gary Burton, Dave Weckl and Eric Marienthal, Robben's new material remains true to the Blues. On this disc, Ford demonstrates some rather exceptional guitar playing, as well as performances on the Wurlitzer and the Piano on a couple of tracks. The CD contains mostly new and original material although Robben has included a sensational cover of Little Walter Jacobs \\"Up The Line\\" as well as Willie Dixon's \\"It Don't Make Sense\\", which is performed extremely well. The CD's highlights while hard to choose, are probably \\"Something For The Pain\\" which has a rather lively beat and uptempo guitar and the slow blues cover of \\"It Don't Make Sense\\". Simply Outstanding!
B000001FI7|5.0|This album came out in 1994? This band came out with some material that was ahead of their time.  With all the electronic music out now, this album sounds pretty \\"fresh\\".  I had a friend a while ago recommend this group, but I didn't listen back then...and now I can't figure out why I didn't pick up this album years ago.  Every song is great...the beats are PHAT!!!!! Pickup this album....it DEFINITELY WILL NOT DISSAPOINT.

0385335482|5.0|This book is the most amazing book I have ever read in my life. Usually, reading for me is a chore, but when I borrowed this book from my sister I was hooked! I couldn't put it down and ran out to buy Shopaholic Takes Manhattan as well. My mother also read the two, and we all laughed together at the schemes she tries to pull. A hilarious book! Can't wait to grab another one of Sophie Kinsella's amazing pieces of work. Garenteed laughter, unless your just a deadbeat.
B00005JKHP|3.0|ST:TMP was supposed to be Star Trek's triumphant return after its ignominious cancellation in 1969.  With all the hype surrounding it, there was little chance it could live up to expectations; sadly, it didn't even come close.  The problems with the film are manifold, and it's difficult to assign blame to any one party.  It starts with the script.  The story is promising - an all-powerful alien \\"thing\\" is approaching Earth and the Enterprise is sent to stop it.  This was the premise used very successfully in many Old Series episodes (\\"Obsession,\\" \\"Doomsday Machine,\\" and \\"Immunity Syndrome\\" being the best), and was later used in ST IV.  However, instead of patterning the story off these episodes, the screenwriters instead chose the dreadful \\"Changling\\" as their template.  When they borrowed from Kubrick's 2001, they chose the incomprehensible (and dull) end segments instead of the wonderous science fiction elements.<br />Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.  The actors are not in character (except Deforest Kelley, who does his best to infuse some semblance of humanity into the inhumane plot).  Director Wise shares some of the responsibility for this with the actors.  In addition, the effects overshadow the dialogue, the exact reverse of what ST stands for.  Because the effects had cost so much, the studio execs (apparently) demanded they get the screen time.  It's not that the individual effects sequences are grossly long, but each one is a little too long, and the cumulative effect is to grow very bored with them. <br />Having said all that, the movie does have good points.  There are flashes of the old Kirk/Spock/McCoy triad that foreshadow better films to come.  The special effects are very impressive, if overlong.  Kirk tries his old standard of trying to talk the alien machine into self-destructing, and when that fails he switches to bluffing it instead.  The score is top-notch.  These items cannot rescue the film overall, however.<br />This new DVD director's cut is better than the original theatrical release (but not as good as the television version).  Many scenes were re-editted with different takes/dialogue, and many new effects (with CGI) were added, and they blend in seamlessly with the old.  The sound is an improvement, but there is still some graininess with the picture (apparently they chose to leave it that way, which is bewildering).  In addition to this new edit and effects, the DVD has a large array of extras, many of which are among the best I've seen.  The text commentary by ST guru Michael Okuda is like a Pop-up Video compilation of nifty facts, such as where sets were re-used in later films/TV series, trivia on the cast and effects, etc.  There are some making-of commentaries, the most interesting is a look at the aborted second series \\"Phase 2,\\" including costume screen tests.  One welcome addition is the inclusion of all the old versions and cut sequences that were in the original theatrical and video cuts of the film, so we can see how they have been changed for the director's cut (George Lucas - pay attention to this when you make the DVD's for Star Wars!).<br />Therefore, I recommend this DVD for any Star Trek fan, based on the extras more than the film itself.  If you are a very casual fan, I would recommend Star Trek II-IV as being far superior (and enjoyable) films.  Hopefully the success of this director's cut DVD will inspire the release of all the Star Trek movies in this format (i.e. double-disc sets with lots of extras).
6302787300|5.0|I recently viewed Ridley Scott's masterpiece 1492:Conquest of Paradise, and I am very proud to say I share the same Italian nationality that Columbus did, and of course new found respect for the founder of the West.<br />This movie was so good because it highlights the details of 15th and 16th Century life and how the Europeans made something from nothing. The politics are also highlighted in this movie, but I think it's fairly done. I'm in total agreement that the savages of those lands had to be civilized in order for there to be peace and progress in those lands, but I can understand the fear held by those tribes against the European invaders. People may disagree about if the Europeans should've stayed and conquered those lands, but nations are won and lost by war, and once Columbus set foot in the West Indies, there's no logic in thinking that the routes to the West wouldn't explode with conquerers.<br />Ridley Scott creates the most beautiful scenes throughout this entire movie, one of my favorite is the ceremony held for Columbus in the cathedral upon returning from his first voyage of discovery.....stunning.<br />The acting is fantastic. If this movie was in French, Depardieu would've easily won Best Actor. That this movie was not nominated back in 1992 is high crime.<br />The music of the film adds to the drama of one of the most dramatic events in the history of the world.<br />Everybody should see 1492 Conquest of Paradise.
B000002MUQ|5.0|This is Van Halen's most mature album of their career.  It is also the most serious; a sense of underlying humor purveyed their earlier work, but it is less apparent here, except in songs like Amsterdam or Big Fat Money.  The guitar work is thickly layered and textured.  Everyone in the band puts out a solid performance, including Sammy.  I became a serious Van Halen after hearing this album; for those who are not Roth-Or-Bust die-hards, this is the best Hagar album.

So rent or buy this if you dare.
0884271153|5.0|Goldratt has been an especially prolific author in recent years. This is the second of three books; the others are The Goal (1992) and Critical Chain (1997). In The Goal, Goldratt's primary focus is on the a-pplications of what he calls a Theory of Constraints (TOC) to the manufacturing process. In that book and in this one, he presents his ideas in the form of fiction (as a novel), complete with a cast of characters, a multi-dimensional narrative (or plot), a variety of settings, and perhaps most important of all, a series of conflicts. Few other authors with sufficient business acumen would attempt, much less succeed (as Goldratt does) in combining the two genres.  Long ago, someone suggested that luck is the residue of preparation.  Goldratt seems to agree. In this volume, he devotes much of his attention to demonstrating the relevance of TOC to marketing, sales, inventory control, distribution channels, strategic alliances, and conflict resolution. I believe it was Carl Rogers who suggested that one of the most effective strategies for conflict resolution is to set aside all points on which both parties agree, each party then makes whatever concessions are appropriate (i.e. terms and conditions of lesser importance); thereby, the parties involved can then concentrate on what are, for both sides, the most important differences. And do so with mutual respect and with goodwill. Goldratt applies the \\"Rogerian Model\\" to countless situations in this book, suggesting that conflict resolution is the result of sustained effort and patience, not luck.<br />It is occasionally said of an especially well-written business book that \\"it reads like a novel.\\" What we have here IS a novel. Never before have executives had more to read and less time for reading. One of this book's most appealing qualities is that it is so easy to read. (The challenge is to make effective applications of TOC in an increasingly more competitive marketplace.) Goldratt is an authority on the business subjects he discusses as well as an excellent teller of tales. That's a rare combination.<br />For whom will this book have greatest value? Obviously, decision-makers who now have one or more of the following needs: to set or re-set the direction of their organization; to formulate appropriate marketing and sales strategies; to improve production, logistics, and distribution; to launch or improve project management initiatives; and/or to strengthen the skills of line managers.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Goldratt's other books, The Goal and Critical Chain; also, to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused. With all due respect to the core concepts Goldratt examines in this volume, they are worthless unless and until embraced by everyone involved. Master and Whyte can help managers to achieve that \\"buy in.\\"subjects he discusses as well as an excellent teller of tales.

0792842731|1.0|This movie does have some really nice settings, but that's about all I can give it.<BR>The action falls flat on its face. Like the time James is driving down the road on his motorcycle and a helicopter comes down the street sideways so its blades can chop him up. What? I'm no authority on helicopters, but I do know enough to say that not even a James Bond helicopter could do that.<BR>And that was the least of what annoyed me.  The movie didn't show any amount military expertise in James Bond, just a lot of pure luck. Hundreds of men got a clear shot at his back and his front and his side, but they always missed.  Lucky for him cause he doesn't appear to understand any basic tactics, fighting skills, or combat stances.  He even pauses in the open under machine gun fire to watch girls climb up walls.  Do the British teach that?  I'm sorry, but if superman attempted half what this man did superman would be dead.  The fact is when twenty machine gunners fire at you all at the same moment you are going to die.  Ask anybody who does no anything about weapons.  I doubt that the British military would allow a man of James Bond's skill to be a private. They might hire his car though.<BR>And since I'm on the technology thing with all the gizmos James has-the perfect gadgets at the perfect moment too-more luck, he reminds me of inspector gadget. <BR>And this isn't over yet.  The plot is entirely driven by his relentless luck which kills any suspense or interest the film could have.<BR>Make James Bond a sappy poet; he'd do great!
B000001GRZ|5.0|This music is mesmerizing. Fournier makes you journey into a transcendent world of utter peace and happiness. Fournier was aristocratic, extremely self-critical artist of the old school.<BR>He also succeeded into the position left vacant by none other than Pablo Casals at Prades in Southern France. Fournier was invited to perform Bach's suites at the Prades festival in the church of San michel de Cuxa. The church was filled to capacity, and the audience was profoundly moved by Fournier's concentrated and deeply felt tribute to Casals. There was no applause at the end of the recital, but instead the entire audience rose to its feet and stood in absolute silence. Moved to tears of joy! Buy these and you will NOT REGRET
B00005ASQ1|1.0|Take a decent idea for a film....and then kill it with bad acting, poor direction, and unnatural dialogue.  That's basically what you have with Finding Forrester.  It could have been good, but too many of the scenes were forced, particularly when Jamal (Brown) dazzles the guy with the BMW with his knowledge of the history of BMW.  It's a scene that's supposed to display Jamal's 'inner intelligence,' but it's forced on you and not believable at all.<br />Good acting makes the viewer believe that what they see is actually taking place.  But most of the extras in this film (especially the Basketball coach), and even one of the leads (Brown), look like they're trying to act.  They look very uncomfortable in their roles.  It's not very good at all.  The best acting in the entire movie is Matt Damon's cameo at the end.<br />And this is definitely not one of Connery's better works.
0884271536|5.0|Goldratt has been an especially prolific author in recent years. This is the third of three books; the others are The Goal (1992) and It's Not Luck (1994). As in those earlier works, Goldratt presents his ideas in this volume within the structure of a novel. When doing so, I think he is much less effective as a storyteller than he is introducing and then developing his core concepts about project management. I am among those who are convinced that process management and project management are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, I believe that effective project management must be integrated within effective process management inorder to improve, for example, cycle time and first pass yield. Moreover, one of the greatest challenges is to identify root causes of barriers to the process and then eliminate them.<br />Another formidable challenge to any organization (regardless of size or nature) is to become and then remain performance-driven, rather than culture-driven. Whatever the \\"critical chain\\" may be, its weakest \\"link\\" is the limiting factor. One of the worst mistakes made, when problems develop, is to respond to symptoms rather than to root causes. As a result, the weakest \\"link\\" is seldom strengthened and perhaps not even identified.<br />In this volume, Goldratt once again examines a fictional context within which there is a cast of characters, a multi-dimensional narrative (or plot), and all manner of disagreements which create conflicts. Never before have executives had more to read and less time for reading. One of this book's most appealing qualities is that it is so easy to read. (The challenge is to make effective applications of TOC in an increasingly more competitive marketplace.) Goldratt is an authority on the business subjects he discusses as well as an excellent teller of tales. That's a rare combination. Once again, he suggests all manner of applications of his Theory of Constraints (TOC). And once again, Goldratt helps the reader to determine how to apply the TOC to her or his own organization.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read his  other books, The Goal and It's Not Luck; also, to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused.

B00004TRD8|5.0|We all know that the dvd set has some pretty great stuff, but for those of you who know or don't know, there is a special extended version that is available on the disc. Do you remember those two scenes that never made it on the special cut version,(see T2 More that meets the eye on Disc 2) ie. 156 mins version, well here's a little surprise, you can have these scenes included in what is called the \\"special extended version\\". To access this, go to the main menu & choose special edition. To the right side of the menu, you will see a set of roman numerials, enter the following sequence, 8 2 9 9 7, recognise these digits!the words the future is not set should appear, special extended version should now show on the menu & the Terminators two eyes should be glowing. I appreciated the special edition for quite some time, & i still do, but take a look at the extended special edition, & you will definitely change your mind & this proves that T2 is more than meets the eye.

Then I found that it also had some great WWII history in it, and was partially set in the Philippines, where I had once lived. I was in seventh heaven. But what kept me spellbound was the way Stephenson spun out the narrative, weaving together the historical characters and the present-day ones so that the read was a real adventure. Neal Stephenson knows how to craft a story; this is (if I may say it) a classical picaresque novel, but written in today's lexicon. Stephenson has been accused, rightfully, of a lack of character development. This really didn't seem to matter very much, as the story, despite the numerous (and to me fascinating) digressions, raced along at a breathless rate. It is pretty hard to rate a book as large as this one a &quot;couldn't lay it down&quot; read, but let us say I lost a lot of sleep until I had finished it. Overall, one of the best books I've read in many a year.

B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes seemingly have been begrudged for everything from their socioeconomic status to their \\"highly derivative\\" debut CD.<BR>What's missed though in this facile assessment of the band is, first, their laudable work ethic in live performances, and secondly, their appreciable talents as a band, in which the debut in my view exemplifies plenty enough through the caliber of most of its songs to the musicianship of the band. Contrast them, for example, to Alicia Keys, who's musicianship consists solely of her voice and piano playing and who can't seem to translate them into reasonably strong song craftmenship, or maybe Linkin Park, who probably take their cue from their record label on fundamentals like musicianship and song craftmenship as a means to sell the highest quantity of CD units or \\"product\\" imaginable. The Strokes don't fall into either camp...
B000063CPL|5.0|Iron maiden are a band that once seen are never forgotten.  This recording is one such event.  After two previously poor live albums in \\"A real live dead one\\" and \\"Live at donnington 1992\\" this one was far superior.<br />Matching the 1985 recording \\"Live after death\\" for quality this album shows what the band can do when they get behind their performances.  Many of the songs on offer here rock far harder than they did when they were onthe albums.  The fast songs really do benefit performed live, \\"The trooper\\" excels the Piece of mind version by being faster and harder, \\"The evil that men do\\" was originally quite a moderately paced song but here the band crank up the volume and pump the song out with pure adrenaline.  <br />Not only this there are numerous long songs that sound incredible on this, \\"sign of the cross\\" from the average album \\"The X factor\\" is turned into a long flashy epic that truly benefits from the powerful vocals of Bruce Dickinson, \\"fear of the dark\\" has always sounded great but here Bruce puts on an air of evil, jus check the evil laugh near the start for proof, and this conveys a dark atmosphere, the biggest surprise though is the band's performance of the song \\"The Clansman\\" from the awful album \\"Virtual XI\\" which is somehow turned into a classic tune with great audience participation and you find yourself at home swishing yor hair and screaming along too!<br />What is great about this album is that the band cover almost all of their albums and this feels like both a great live album come Greatest hits.  The only problem I have with this is that the album \\"Somewhere in time\\" was ignored.  While \\"The clansman\\" is good song that is performed well I feel that it would have been special if the band could have performed either \\"Caught somewhere in time\\" or maybe a true treat in their classic song \\"Alexander the Great\\".  However never mind that is a minor gripe and the album is a great listen, the performances live on stage are always awesome and I do recommend that you check out the DVD of this, it is a shame that the band have not decided to release this on VHS as I feel that the market of VHS is still far larger than that of DVD.  Still everyone who is into Maiden must definitey own this cd,UP THE IRONS!!!

6304143184|3.0|Last night we saw the 20th Anniversary edition of ET: The Extraterrestrial. The first thought which occured to me was what primative lives we endured back then. We had no CD players, no DVD, no home computers. Just broadcast TV and that absurd, clunky analog record player which was so prominent in Elliot's room.<br /><br />And then of course there was how twenty years of popular culture have changed our additudes. Twenty years which have included fare such as the X Files (not to mention Waco and Ruby Ridge) have rendered those evil government agents which frightened us so much back then somewhat less than scary now. We know what real evil, government agents are capable of and those clowns weren't them.<br /><br />Now if Speilberg had digitally inserted the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files, instead of digitally removing their guns, things would be different.<br /><br />But another thing, so far not mentioned in other media, is the famous OR scene, where the scary doctors are working over ET while Elliot is screaming, \\"Stop! You're killing him! YOU'RE KILLING HIM!\\" Back them most of us remember being frightened and scared along with Elliot. But now, after watching a lot of episodes of ER, we all had a vaugue understanding of the medical jargon the doctors were using. They weren't trying to kill ET. They were trying to help. Yep, blood gasses look bad. Need to start defibing. And for God's sake, someone take that hysterical kid out of here.<br /><br />Nope, I guess you can't go home again.<br />(...)
0375707972|3.0|This is a very disturbing book. I am uncomfortable with a 36-year-old woman seducing a 15-year-old boy, and not being charged with some crime.  I don't like the tone of their relationship, it wasn't loving, and it was more a case of Hanna controlling Michael. The way it tried to excuse, or at the very least minimize Hanna's guilt. You have a pedophile that was also a cold-blooded Nazi war criminal. That's not a love story. It's very disturbing just how many readers thought it was a 'wonderful' love story and seemed unmoved by her manipulation of a teenage boy. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific times in world history. Germany has to live with what they did. I think this is a case of trying to deal with the guilt that the German people still carry.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've EVER seen with my kids.  If you didn't see it in the theatre it is a must buy if you have children.  Even my 22 month old stayed still and watched the whole movie.  We've spent the last 5 months \\"scaring\\" each other with monster toys and he won't sleep without his Sully stuffed toy.  Your kids will never again be afraid of monsters in the closet, under the bed, etc. Highly entertaining for every age group, even parents and grandparents!
B00004RFFI|4.0|Kind of like in 'Jurassic Park', the actors in this film take a back seat(way back) to the real stars: the special effects. The twisters in this film are as close to real as movies can get, and they make youre hair stand on end just watching.<BR>The story starts really well, with a flash-back sequence that shows just why Helen Hunt's charactor is so obsessed with finding what makes twisters tick. However, the story kinda bogs and drags after that, although whenever a tornado appears, the film just kicks it into a higher gear.<BR>The actors involved try really hard to make something out of the weak dialogue they're working with, but the main reason to watch this for the twisters. They have a malevolence all their own, and seem to have minds of their own, as they chasedown the main good guys.<BR>Again, not much story substance, but with effects like this, who needs it?
B00005JKZQ|4.0|I went to see this movie today and I really enjoyed it.  It was a fuuny movie.  Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy make a great team.
B000002KGT|5.0|This is a great CD.  I've owned it on cassette, 8-track, vinyl and CD since I was about 8yo, in 1978.  What I was wondering was...why isn't there a remastered version of this CD with &quot;Silver Springs&quot; on it.  On the classic albums DVD, it was stated that the took the song off because of time constraints with vinyl records. Well, here it is in the CD age and we have yet to see this song surface other than on the so-so live CD &quot;The Dance&quot; So if you are reading this and you work warner bros. records, please get your head out of your you-know-where and re-release this cd with &quot;Silver Springs&quot; on it.  Thank you.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against the Machine fight and sing for their freedom of speech and having their voices heard. It isn't America they're just against....its the entire world. Alot of people suffer because of poor government. Families and people die because of war. And people rebel because they're against their system, and that's what this album is all about. The Album starts out with Testify in which the title speaks for it self. Good song for an intro. Guerrilla Radio (#1 on the album) has great guitar riffs and a cool crazy solo. Calm Like A Bomb is filled with outrageous wammy effects and a good chorus line. Mic Check pumps out the bass in the song, not a bad song. Sleep Now In The Fire is a great song with solo you can't ingnore. Born of a Broken Man has great guitar chords with a loud and pounding chorus that'll make you jump up and never go down. Born as Ghosts is the most creative song in the album. Filled with great solos and crazy effects. Maria is a pretty good song in which probably has the longest lyrics into it. Voice of the Voiceless is a good song, short, but good. New Millennium Homesis has a nice chorus, pretty good song to listen to. Ashes in the Fall has a cool guitar effect that makes this song original. Finally, War Within A Breath is another \\"Freedom\\" for this album but has a great chorus and a great ending. With Zach De La Rocha's amazing vocals and Tom Morello's amazing guitar solos and effects, The Battle Of Los Angeles is a definite album you should own.

0385334206|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's novel &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; follows the odyssey of oddball science fiction writer Kilgore Trout from his melancholy childhood in Bermuda, to the sleazy underside of New York City, and eventually to a fateful encounter with car dealer Wayne Hoover, a man &quot;on the brink of going insane.&quot; Within this framework Vonnegut weaves an amazing satiric tapestry that looks at racism, mental illness, environmental crises, the nature and function of art, and many other issues. The book is filled with Vonnegut's own quirky illustrations.<br />&quot;Breakfast&quot; is harsh, even cruel, but also tender and compassionate; it's laugh-out-loud funny, yet haunting and tragic. It's also a reality-warping metaphysical triumph; Vonnegut breaks down the barriers between reality and fiction, and invites the reader into the very process of the novel's creation. He creates a more intimate bond between author, reader, and fictional character than any other writer I can think of.<br />Vonnegut presents some of American literature's most memorable characters in &quot;Breakfast.&quot; But my favorite is undoubtedly Trout. Throughout the book we also get glimpses of Trout's own voluminous body of work, and meet some of his bizarre sci-fi characters. The book as a whole is also enriched by Vonnegut's unique style; he writes as if for an extraterrestrial audience to whom humanity is utterly alien.<br />&quot;Breakfast&quot; is a profane, naughty, yet profoundly spiritual book. Filled with strange and vivid details, it's an oddly comforting modern-day testament for our fractured world. Thanks, Kurt.

B000002J1H|5.0|1977 was a year in which genres like punk, disco, new wave, and \\"corporate rock\\" reigned supreme. Progresive rock music didn't necessarily die in '77, while prog-rock and so-called \\"corporate rock\\" bands like Styx, Kansas, and Boston all had top ten albums that year. It was a year that also saw star keysman Rick Wakeman return to the Yes fold. In late '76, Patrick Moraz tried to give it another go with Yes, but he found that he was pretty much out of sync with the band and the band missed Wakeman a lot, so Moraz left and Wakeman returned permanently, well, until early 1980 after just coming in a session man. When he returned to make music with Yes, they put out an album with some of the most memorable, fresh, and breathtaking music they had ever done and it made the top ten in late '77. The album begins with the title track and Alan White counting 1, 2, a 1, 2, 3, 4 and off they go. Steve Howe does a little something different this time around. He plays a steel guitar from start to finish and he really put great use to it in the song. White's drumming and Chris Squire's playing goes very well along with Wakeman's. But the real thing here is Jon Anderson's voice. I don't think his voice can ever soar the high again. He does a magnificent vocal performance from start to finish. Turn of the Century and the FM radio hit Wonderous Stories are very beautiful ballads, but the former is so beautiful and so heartfelt, it can bring tears to your eyes. Parallels, with it's giant pipe organ intro and solo, is one of the band's most dynamic songs and so is Awaken. Awaken is one of Yes' best epic masterworks and the first song to introduce the harp among the band's instrumental reportoire. The playing, the vocal harmonies, everything about this album is so astounding, it'll be one of those albums that will live on forever, that is if anyone else besides Yes fans will ever notice it. This of one of the best albums from the greatest Prog-rock band of all-time.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I normally review classical albums, but this is just as beautiful to me. Most of the album sounds like people sincerely singing from their hearts and souls... and that's what music's all about for me. Great music is great music, whether done by the almost god-like proportioned voices of the great opera stars or these wonderful down-home voices performing here. If you're a fan of Bluegrass and old time gospel, this album is a special treat. God bless the producers and the musicians for putting out an album like this!
0385495323|5.0|The best thing about this book is that you don't need to have a major in math, computing, physics or chemistry to understand what codes are about. Not just that, but also to know how codes have been developed, evolutioned, and either been broken or still being a challenge.<br />This book shows you how codes (and ciphers) have been related to queens, treasures, religion, war, languages and much more. It gives you stories of fear, hope and will. This makes the reading very interesting. Have you wondered who was the Man in the Iron Mask?<br />You'll find a lot of references for further reading. The book is excellent as an introduction to codes and you'd want to read more about the subject; the book shows and explains to you the ways to take.<br />I didn't like some opinions from the author in the last chapter, but I do agree that there are many points of view about privacy, code breaking, and science, and these are continuosly changing. <br />You would finish the book agreeing or not; nontheless, you will know a lot more about codes, ciphers and writing systems.
B00003CX9E|5.0|i had this film as an assignment in a film noir class. i'd never seen it before and had read very little about it, knew nothing of the plot, or who bill hearst was, etc etc. if you'd asked me about \\"rosebud,\\" i'd have assumed it was an obscene reference (and according to roger ebert it is). i was essentially unbiased as to the content of the film. <br />on first viewing i found it \\"sentimental,\\" yet effective for the really good (by any standards) performances of welles, cotton, et al. it's a \\"life story,\\" quite literally, from early childhood to death, of a larger-than-life figure; so it's bound to impress the viewer with the sheer scope of its subject and its inevitable tackling of monumental life issues, including the meaning of life itself in a way more direct, really, in its simplicity than has ever been achieved before or since in cinema. the ultimate sentiment implied by the word \\"rosebud,\\" the snow-globe, the sled itself, is that of childhood innocence lost. that winter day when his mother handed him over to the bank might have been the last of his life. there is the idea that the world and worldly life corrupt the soul, and that his mother, though she may have felt she was acting in his interest, had therefore sold his soul to the devil as it were that day and sealed his fate. <br />there were a few points i missed the first time through, so i decided to watch it again with one of the commentaries - roger ebert's. this is certainly one of the better commentaries i've heard on dvd; all too often they degenerate into brainless pedantic ramblings that have nothing to do with anything, but ebert brings his knowledge of the making of the film, of welles himself, of the sundry ground-breaking techniques and effects used in the film - nearly every shot is a special effect - and of the many layers of meaning in the elements of the story, adding comprehensively to one's knowledge and appreciation of the film. plus he actually talks about the scenes that are on the screen as he's talking. how often can you say that. so i watched the whole thing again, and the vista widened. <br />the next day i watched it again, this time with the peter brogdonovich commentary. this was just as informative as ebert's, and by the time it was over, i felt like i'd made the damn movie. i also felt like i never wanted to see it again, it having occupied something like 9.5 of the last 24 hours of my life. of course, i did watch parts of it again and again as i wrote my paper. <br />by the way i got an \\"a\\". these director commentaries on dvds are great for film classes. (the teacher recommended we watch them, i wasn't \\"cheating\\" at all.) very comprehensive and facinating. oh - i watched that hearst documentary and the \\"making of\\" thing too, they also helped a great deal. i bought this dvd for this asignment, but i havent watched it since my paper, i admit - i did burn myself out on it. but it's still a powerful movie, unique in the history of cinema for the degree of nigh-omnipotence the hollywood \\"powers that be\\" allowed to be invested in one genius - the 26-year-old orson welles - to realize the project, and for the inevitable epoch-making backlash thereby incurred, which really did cripple welles' career permanently and probably set everybody back a few decades. <br />a legendary film in every sense.  i can't believe another reviewer called it \\"boring\\" but hey, no accounting for tastes.  he probably thinks \\"dude wheres my car\\" is the paradigm.
B00005QJDG|5.0|I own four Dream Theater studio albums - IMAGES &amp; WORDS (1992), AWAKE (1994), A CHANGE OF SEASONS (1995), and SCENES FROM A MEMORY (1999) - and each one of them blew me away, showing an extremely talented band just outdoing themselves on every release.  Two weeks ago this coming Saturday, I purchased DT's triple live album LIVE SCENES FROM NEW YORK, and I haven't been able to listen to the studio recordings since.  The live versions of their songs sound so much richer and intense when performed in concert.  As an added bonus, the band includes new extended sections and snippets from other songs into their set list, which makes for an awesome experience.  Besides the flawless song selection, the sound quality and musicianship are the best I've heard on a live recording, let only one that spans three discs.  John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy prove to be great producers as well as great musicians.  There's so much energy on this, I don't know where to begin.  It is truly the best live album I've ever heard, period.  Everybody should own a copy, but get the studio CDs first to become familiar with the songs.  The band barnstorms their way through their now-legendary concept album SCENES FROM A MEMORY (played in its entirety, like TOMMY and THE WALL before it), classics from I&amp;W and AWAKE, and a couple from FALLING INTO INFINITY.  To close out this review, here is a list of highlights that you will expect to hear on each of the three discs.  Enjoy!<br />Highlights on Disc 1:<br />&quot;Strange Deja Vu&quot; (track 3)--Filled with 100 times more energy than the original.  When the band tears into that instrumental section...whew!<br />&quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot; (track 5)--Just as heavy, but more delicate and melodic than the studio counterpart...that is, until the extraordinary jam at the end smacks you across the face!<br />&quot;Beyond This Life&quot; (track 6)--The reviewer at metal-reviews.com said DT doesn't rock out enough.  All he has to do is listen to this and be shown that this is not true.<br />&quot;John &amp; Teresa Solo Spot&quot; (track 7)--Gospel singer Teresa Thompson makes her first appearance, performing a vocal/guitar duet with Petrucci.  Petrucci's solo is fantastic.  It's like Alex Lifeson-meets-Stevie Ray Vaughan.<br />&quot;Through Her Eyes&quot; (track 8)--This simple and slow ballad is turned into an emotional rollercoaster with an extended, powerful ending.  Better than the original.<br />&quot;The Dance of Eternity&quot; (track 10)--Amazing how they pulled this complex instrumental off live.  Proves DT are the most talented musicians to ever exist.<br />Highlights of Disc 2:<br />&quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot; (track 2)--Starts out normally, but soon Teresa comes back to sing Victoria's part and the gospel choir comes out to lend support.  When James LaBrie hits that final note at the end and Teresa and the choir sing in unison with him, it made my hair stand up!  Unbelievable!<br />&quot;Metropolis, Part 1&quot; (track 4)--DT's classic epic is further indication of DT's virtuosity and talent in the live setting.  I like James's speech to the crowd in the middle of the song.  Very nice guy.<br />&quot;The Mirror&quot; (track 5)--Lots of energy on this one, and it manages to sound heavier than the original, but very listenable.  John Myung's thunderous bassline at the end has to be heard to believed.<br />&quot;Caught in a New Millennium&quot; (track 8)--A back-and-forth medley of &quot;New Millennium&quot; and &quot;Caught in a Web.&quot;  It's cool how to managed to play the latter slowly.  Love that infectious groove on &quot;Millennium.&quot;<br />&quot;Jordan Rudess Keyboard Solo&quot; (track 10)--An astounding 6-minute keyboard solo by Rudess, who is an unqualified genius on the instrument.  He starts out with classical touches, then leads right into Victorian-era stuff, and ends with a techno beat and flashy keys work.<br />Highlights of Disc 3:<br />&quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot; (track 1-3)--DT's epic AWAKE suite played to the fullest.  &quot;Erotomania&quot; kicks major tail live; &quot;Voices&quot; sounds even more haunting and emotional in concert; and &quot;The Silent Man&quot; is completely changed, with electric guitar, a funky piano solo, and an ultra-melodic ending.<br />&quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; (track 5)--The band's 23-minute opus is the encore.  They have balls to play a 20+ minute song as tired as they probably were.<br />My hat goes off the audience throughout the concert.  Handclaps, screams, and singing along to the lyrics--almost everywhere!

B00002ND77|5.0|I was at first disapointed that Muhammad Ali wasn't in the movie, but then I told myself that that wasn't the point of the story.  Malcolm, though misguided in alot of his ways at the begining began to change his mind about what the Muslim religion is about.  He became more open minded and if hadn't of died, I believe that he would have become a man like Martin Luther King was.  He has probably one of the best speeches known to man.  Denzel Washington I believe captured the essence of Malcolm X to the \\"T\\".  I rate this movie 5 stars.
B0000634EV|5.0|Think of this album as a one of a kind gun with 15 bullets designed to blow your mind. it may not be as brutal as Nola but it is . In its experience. There is a equal share of the ripping and the mellow. Songs like New Orleans.. just hammers as does the Seed. Ghosts.. and Lysergik.  continue to rip at the hole they dug in your eardrums, but to sooth the beautiful wounds there is Learn from this mistake, and Where im going. And the rest kick also but i think i labeled enough. Phils voice is back to what we new it could be but werent to sure of it still was and believe me it is. The bayou heavyness of the musicians really shine, pepper rips. rex rips, kirk rips  and jimmy rips. And as a closer a 7 minute plus acoustic masterpeice. Down is back and so damn unreal. I just pray they dont wait another 7 years to release another.

B00005QZWI|5.0|I am not your typical LOTR fan. I watched the movie without having read the books. Still, the movie made an impression on me. Several months later, I read the trilogy, then watched the movie for a second time. Afterwards, I was so moved that I bought the CD. I was not disappointed--this soundtrack is incredible! It deserved to win an Oscar for best score. The only problem is that I can't study while it's on. It's so beautiful that it brings the movie back to life and makes me want to cry. Still, I absolutely love it--so haunting and beautiful.
0385335482|5.0|My cousin gave me this book &amp; I thought it would make a good, light read.  Well, can I just say that I was pleasantly suprised to find that it was very hard to put down!  It really was that good.  I laughed out loud many, many times.  Thank goodness I live in NYC, where behavior like that, when you are alone on a crowded commuter train, won't even raise an eyebrow! <br />Sophie Kinsella's style of writing is very enjoyable, you really got into Rebecca's head.  You felt all of her fears, insecurities and triumphs right along with her.  For me, that's the most important quality for an author to achieve in his or her story, regardless of how light the topic is.  <br />Two thumbs up!
B000005RYQ|5.0|The Police where one of the greatest acts of the late 1970's and the 80's. The music is characterised by a strongly accentuated subsidiary beat with a distinct reggae resemblance. Also noticeable are the bands powerful lyrics.<br />The Police Greatest Hits takes us through the bands best known songs. My personal favourites are 'Can't Stand Losing You' (1978), 'Message In A Bottle' (1979), Walking On The Moon (1979), 'Don't Stand So Close To Me' (1980),  'Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic' (1981) and social commentaries like 'De Do Do Do , De Da Da Da ' (1980) and 'Spirits In The Material World' (1981).
B00003W8NM|5.0|When this movie was in the theaters, I wrote it off as a stupid, testosterone-driven buddy movie. I figured at the end, Pitt and Norton would square off in a trite, Hollywood ending.<br />After I finally rented it (and then immediately purchased it), I realized how badly I had misjudged this movie.<br />First off--yes, it is violent in spots. But even if that stuff bothers you, I urge you to see it anyway. Without divulging too much of the plot, Fight Club is really more psychological than anything else. You actually need to see it more than once to appreciate the dialogue, the philosophies of the characters, and just how amazing and innovative some of the visual effects are. <br />Just to give you a little insight--The plot, minus its twists, is pretty straight forward: A Yuppie whose name is never spoken in the film(Norton) meets a rebel named Tyler Durden (Pitt) who uses fighting as a means of self-exploration. Tyler is opposed to how soft society has become, and rejects material possessions in search of something more.<br />Along the way, you'll be treated to some great one-liners, some twisted yet well-thought out philosophies, and some great acting by both Norton and Pitt. <br />Everyone I've leant the DVD tells me this is the most bizarre film they've ever seen, and they loved every minute of it. I think you'll feel the same.
0792844882|1.0|In a recent episode of 'Black Books', the fabulous British sitcom set in a second-hand bookstore, a volume was promoted entitled 'Tempocalypse' which, in its cynical combination of women's issues and violent thriller, was designed to appeal to both genders.  Something of the sort seems to have been the thinking behind 'Showgirls', a film which tries to attract a (heterosexual) male demographic, with its extensive scenes of lapdancing, er, show-girling and sex, all fetishising women's bodies (naturally) rather than men's; yet tries to claim itself as a feminist narrative about a young women trying to negotiate her own identity in a violently exploitative and sleazy male subculture, that turns women from potential allies into ruthless rivals.  Throw in some campy musical sequences and a lesbian subplot, and you've got something for everyone.  In this, it is no different from any Hollywood blockbuster, which tries to reach as wide and varied an audience as possible, at the expense of originality, individuality and clarity.  In the end, these things rarely please anyone, and with the exception of a few dirty macs, nobody went to 'Showgirls'.<br />Verhoeven's film, in its schizophrenic attempt to unite male and female pleasure; or, more precisely, a female story filmed with a male gaze, mixes the music with the Western.  'Showgirls' is basically an update of '42nd Street', with its story of an unknown becoming an unexpected star, and all those Warners backstage musicals, with auditions, rehearsals, backstage life, sleazy financiers, tough-but-decent producers etc.  And in a way, Verhoeven is only making literal the erotic euphemisms choreographed by Busby Berkeley in his big numbers.  But by removing the element of play, that contract between choreographer and audience that knew these were more than groups of girls dancing, by simply exhibiting sexuality, Verhoeven removes all those psychic proceses that create the ideas, fantasies and experiences of sexuality for audience.  But Verhoeven can argue that he was trying to avoid fantasy, that this documentary-like hard look at an exploitative industry is why his film is feminist.  This doesn't explain the lingering framing of female flesh, but theoretically, a film about lap-dancing should reveal the tools of the trade just as a film about doctors or soldiers would focus on scalpels and guns.  I read that 'Showgirls' was actually a satire on contemporary Hollywood and its behind-the-scenes machinations - this makes the film more forceful, as it's always interesting to see the corrupted Ozes behind glittering Emerald Cities, but it doesn't make it any more competent a piece of film-making.  <br />Ultimately, 'Showgirls' is a Western, about a heroine who moves from East to West, from New York to Las Vegas; a character who tries to create a new identity, lifestyle and freedom for herself away from the oppressions of the past and authority.  If it hadn't been such a gawpfest, you'd almost be tempted to think the film  WAS feminist, such is the way Verhoeven and Esterhaz play with genres and cliches only to confound them - see the road-to-damnation drug subplot for example.  But it is a gawpfest.
0783225857|5.0|There's very little to be said about this incredible film that hasn't been said before. When I was 14 I went, alone, to see this film. Afterward, I was speechless. I immediately decided it was my favorite film of all time, and, 40 years later, it still is. Horton Foote's brilliant screenplay accomplished a feat that is almost unparallelled: it reduced a complex, character-driven series of events into a 2 hour coherent classic narrative. Its profound effect on me has been a bit of a character builder for me; I'm a better person, I think, for having seen this film at a young age. I encourage all people with children in their life to show this to them. Kids often pay more attention to a film that's seen thru the eyes of kids. There simply can't be any way that your kid won't be moved profoundly. I've seen it happen to my own, and I, myself, am living proof.
B000063CPL|1.0|I cant believe they included \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" in their live album!! Nothing against the old days, much on the contrary. They were the best days for Iron Maiden. But, form that time, \\"Prowler\\" is better; \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is better; \\"Remember TOmorrow\\" is better, \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" is better, \\"The  Prisoner\\" is better, and so on and so on!!!!! Iron Maiden and Sanctuary are some of the silliest songs Maiden ever wrote (musically and lyrically)!! Worst than this, they were already featured in the other live albums by Maiden!! It seems like Rush, that always put \\"Closer to the Heart\\" in their live albums!! Really boring!! What a lack of imagination!!<BR>THis Live set at least tried to capture on disc the excitment of a live peformance in front of 200 hundred thousand people. But, Steve Harris, please, get rid of Janick Gers and chose your live set more properly!!
B00005ARDC|4.0|some say the &quot;return of rawk&quot; began with creed and all the other posers. true believers know it never went away, it just got bloated on a steady diet of mtv and &quot;alternative&quot; radio. along comes BRMC, white stripes, strokes, shins, etc. like climbing into a '67 mustang, instead of a pimped out honda. as to BRMC, there are a few tracks i have skipped, which has left me giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. but overall, i have listened to it almost daily since last fall. i gave my soul to a new religion, and its priests are brmc
B000002UJQ|5.0|This cd shows where they got their reputation. The music is stunning and the lyrics are at least as good. Here's what I think about the songs:<br />Airbag- a very good song has good lyrics and music. It is very good but is probably the weakest song on the cd.<br />Paranoid Android- My personal favorite! This song is almost six and a half minutes and every second is great. The lyrics seem completely nonsense they actually are extremely smart and intelligent. The music goes right with the words show moods and a mind with problems that words can't express. This song has 3 awesome parts and the &quot;Rain down&quot; part my be my favorite but it is tough to decide.<br />Subterranean Homesick Alien- This song has great lyrics and just as good music. The music gets the alien sounds.<br />Exit Music (For A Film)- Great, sad lyrics and sad music to go along. The lyrics as done so not everything is told and can be left for intrepitation, a great way of writing.<br />Let Down- Extremely good strong lyrics that have a deeper meaning than the surface. And the music is very good give the feeling of flying like it was writen about.<br />Karma Police- I don't know why but this seems to be the song that proves them better than U2. Great lyrics, amazing singing, even better piano.<br />Fitter Happier- Another song that gets in the the mind of a person who has troubles. He cares so much for everything around him and seems to be haunted by that. This song always makes me sad. Good background.<br />Electioneering- Very good, but second weakest track. The guitar and cow bell get the campaining mood going.<br />Climbing Up the Walls- Haunting this also gets in the mind of someone that is paranoid. The music fits the lyrics perfectly. This sounds like Amnsiac.<br />No surprises- A very good song great lyrics and a very happy sounding background.<br />Lucky- Also easily beats U2. Amazing vocals, and just as good instrumentals. The second best song on the cd.<br />The Tourist- Another greatone, everything is good.<br />This is my favorite cd now the only cd that I think my beat is is The Bends which I haven't bought yet. If you have any doubts buy it NOW! It as AMAZING!
0345440803|1.0|What a bunch of nonsense!  It sets back child-rearing to the era of the &quot;fifties&quot; and &quot;sixties&quot; - Ms. Hogg &amp; Ms. Blau actually instruct &quot;good, caring parents&quot; to ask permission of the toddler before putting socks on, shoes on.  The entire book is a farce and only trains toddlers to become VERY disappointed young adults when (in the REAL world) their teachers, friends, bosses will not cater to their every whim or wish.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|\\"Strictly Ballroom\\" reminds me of a Hercules episode I saw once. I am sure \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" was part of the inspiration for the show. In Hercules there is a town where everything revolves around dancing, ballroom dancing to be specific. However, the judge demands that everyone uses only approved dance steps. A young girl refuses and wants to dance her own steps. She is banished from the studio and is without a partner for the big competition. Enter Hercules who agrees to dance with her. The awkward young girl becomes a graceful dancer and they win the competition and the love of the audience.<BR>     Everything is virtually the same for \\"Strictly Ballroom.\\" The town is crazy about ballroom dancing, improvisation is frowned upon, their is an awkward girl that becomes a graceful dancer, the loss of a partner and the moral of the story, be true to your heart. Here though the star of the show is Scott Hastings. His wild crowd pleasing dance steps have lost him a big dance title. His partner dumps him for someone else and he is without a partner with only three weeks to go till the big championship dance. Enter the awkward girl. Fran has only been dancing for two years, but believes in the importance of letting the music flow through you. They partner up and win or lose vow to show the dance world a thing a two. While bringing out the best in each other, they fall in love. They also uncover the surprising truth about Scott's Father as well as showing how cutthroat the dancing world can be.<BR>     \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is not as visually catching as \\"Moulin Rouge\\" The story is a bit clichs, but the actors give the story such heart that you can over look it. Furthermore the actor portraying Scott's dad is hilariously tragic. The pacing keeps the audience involved with the stories. The only piece of criticism is that we don't learn much about Fran's heritage, her family or why dancing is so important to her. She simply wants to dance, and dance with Scott. Other than that the film is pleasure to watch....
B00003CXXP|5.0|THAT's Steven Spielberg's devine gift - he KNOWS how to touch your soul.  [Sure it sounds mushy, but try to see this one through innocent eyes wide open].  Forget about the Sci-fi hoopla - the effects are great, unusual, etc. etc. etc.  BUT it's the artificial boy's journey - a close cousin to Tim Burton's 'Edward Scissorhands', also about love and acceptance.<br />Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law and Frances O'Connortake you through this journey with great sensitivity - so where are the awards?
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a film that was completely mismarketed. This is not a film, as the previews and original teaser suggested, about pure male testosterone being manifested in basement brawls. It is not a mindless-violence, action-hero flick used solely as a vehicle to show the washboard abs and chiseled man-waist of Brad Pitt. It is, actually, a film about the chaotic descent into madness and clarity by the main character. It is about the schism of personality that occurs not only with manic depressives or schizophrenics, but on a smaller scale with each and every one of us, every day, as we question our purpose, our reasons for fitting the mold when all we want to do is break free, and our intense and inward reactions to the immense pressures of culture and society.<BR>     In this phenomenally directed film, we watch the main character, \\"Jack,\\" played by an intensely baggy-eyed Edward Norton, stagger through his Starbucks-saturated life as a claims investigator for a major automotive company. Upon returning from a business trip, two major turning points coincide in Jack's life-he meets the charismatic and unfettered soap salesman Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and he returns to his condo to discover that his precisely coordinated IKEA-like furniture and accessories have been incinerated in an explosion. The first appearance of the \\"fight club\\" after which the movie is named occurs that same night, when Jack calls Tyler for some solace over a beer. As they leave the bar, Tyler challenges Jack with the words \\"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\\" Thus begins the strange world in which men beat each other up seemingly just for the pleasure of it.<BR>     Tyler, with Jack always a few steps behind him, builds an underground network of fight clubs, where men come to test their strength and feel alive. This is not a film that exploits violence simply for the entertainment factor. It's a deeply funny, deeply thoughtful film about the roots of violence, and the possible need forviolence amongst the displaced men of today's culture. Suckled on advertising and inhabiting the soft life of corporations, how can the past hunters of society not be driven to make violence-or at least something that feels powerful-with their hands? It taps into the rage men feel at being promised and denied a spot as a demi-god in the culture simply because of their gender, and also taps into the hopelessness the younger generation feels at having been raised without our fathers.<BR>     Helena Bonham Carter is really the only woman in the film, but having a mostly male cast does not hurt this film for an intelligent female audience. So many of its components speak more directly to a generational frustration than any male-female dilemma, and the insights on the current male situation through this film are thought provoking regardless of gender.<BR>     Rest assured, you'll be able to discuss and debate this movie with your friends for countless hours, and each time you view it, you'll find something new to contribute to the conversation. It does have a Sixth-Sense-esque plot twist that I won't reveal here, in case you agreed with my initial statement that the flick was mismarketed, and therefore never saw it. I'm eternally glad I let myself be argued into seeing what I had already dismissed as a gratuitous smash-fest featuring the less-than-desirable Pitt (I call him \\"Pockmark\\"), as it now holds strong at #2 on my list of favorite movies of all time. David Fincher has created something truly stunning out of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, and the acting performances by all involved are hilarious, dynamic, utterly natural and completely absurd....
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Alice through the Looking Glass was never like this one - maybe it was?  A wire-brush scrubbing of the soul - this one is!<br />The Cast?  Headed by the brilliant Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, the mother, with son Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and the pal and Jennifer Connelly as the Girlfriend it is quite something - should be mandatory viewing [impossible though] for the under age.  This journey makes &quot;The days of Wine and Roses&quot;<br />look like &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.<br />A sharp reflection about the dangers of addiction [you name it - they got it] expertly perceived by director Darren Aronofsky.  [Brilliant editing - never has a fridge spewed more menace since that wrestling sequence from Tony Richardson's &quot;The Loved One&quot;.]<br />Must see and must have - right next to its slightly more operatic, but equally bold &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;.<br />Also &quot;Bravo&quot; to author Hubert Selby Jr.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|WELL!  I avoided this one like the plague, just couldn't accept the concept of dove-tailing modern music ala Madonna, Elton John, etc. into the vivid world [thank you John Huston - the 1952 version] of whores, pimps, dancers, singers, drug addicts, alcoholics and one or two nice people ......  IF you've moved through that area [Blanche,Pigalle,Sacre Couer,DuVallon] you'll recognize it!<br />YOU will either love this crazy movie - OR hate it - you cannot be luke warm about this one.  MYself?  Naturally loved it, cannot get enough!  It's brilliant DVD strategy - an experience unto itself, a Super 2 disc set with extended dance sequences, etc. etc. etc.<br />Always versatile, NICOLE KIDMAN vividly reminds one of Rita Hayworth or is it Moira Shearer?  BUT she still owns Satine  -  a rare beauty.  An Award-Winning performance!<br />Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the naive love interest.<br />Bravo Baz Luhrmann!
B00004XOWM|3.0|If you're stomach enough to face the 30+ barrage of 'F' words that adorn opening song Hot Dog, chances are you'll probably enjoy this album, a profanity-packed powerhouse of thunderous riffs and angsty lyrics seeming unsophisticated but strangely clever ie. &quot;Gonna do things my way/It's my way/My way or the highway&quot;. Many people will see Limp Bizkit as a cartoon band; but anyway, if you don't then enjoy it anyway - though don't take it at all seriously.
0393317552|5.0|I can't recall the last time my mind was this stimulated reading about human history. Jared Diamond's book, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is a very thought provoking book. I came across it by chance at the L.A. Natural Musuem and glad that I did, it widened my perspective and respect for people of different cultures.
B00004Z459|4.0|The platinum-selling Hybrid Theory is one of the greatest nu-metal albums in a genre that usually relies little on clever lyrics and more on hysterics and driving guitars. Here, the well organized production ensures very good, short tracks that do their job well and actually sound well crafted rather than just a lot of noise. The lyrics revolve around angst etc. in clever metaphor on top of tuneful metal that will sound great on modern radio. A welcome alternative to Limp Bizkit.
0060931671|5.0|Whether you enjoy this book or hate every last pretentious minute of it, understand it or are puzzled by it's calculated circular logic, whether you lightly skim it or read all the endless sholarly notes on it, this book will make you think. And it's the thought that counts.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I cannot express how amazing this album is. Everyone must have a copy. Californication is a truly moving album, and has the ability to uplift without doing so in a silly or meaningless way. The lyrics are so clever yet sincere and Anthony Kiedis sings them in a marvellous voice; each band member does his job perfectly. Flea, the world's greatest bass player, adds rhythm in a way that is essential to the music but not immediately apparent; returning guitarist John Frusciante truly is a one-in-a-million talent; guitar solos like the one at the end of Easily are literally breathtaking in a manner which is seldom heard in today's world of music. Drummer Chad Smith is a truly underrated talent who sublimely adds another dimension to the music. I can't describe how great it all is. Just trust me, if you don't have the album you must buy it - it's the best RHCP album and possibly the best album of all time.
0385334206|5.0|I love this book. It is full of insight, humor, beauty, some wisdom, and some juvenile asides just to make all seem less overwhelming. Kurt Vonnegut knows how to make tough thoughts go down easier. He is the reader's friend. Just don't be like Duane Hoover and mistake friendship for spiritual guidance. We're all individuals with free will, as this book reminds us.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink is a singer with a very diverse style as is evidenced by the hip-hop, R&B of her debut and the pop rock of her sophomore effort. Both definitely show Pink's taste for various genres of music. Her debut CD, CAN'T TAKE ME HOME which has sold more than 2 million copies to date, was released in April of 2000 with THERE YOU GO as the lead single promoting the disc. Although I did not really care for the song initially, I decided to take a chance and buy the cd. I am very happy that I took the chance. Thank you Lord because this is a kind of music that we rarely hear from white singers. I mean Pink did her thing by just coming in and singing music that mainly African-Americans were singing and fitting it into her own style. She instantly became the ghetto, homegirl for many representing the White Urban side of America that many people do not know about.<br />SPLIT PERSONALITY-This 1st song is a very good introduction to the world of Pink with its somewhat weird and schizophrenic beat. Pink is dealing with both of her personalities here with one of them singing and the other talking. Though it takes a while to get used to, it is a very nice song like none other. A-<br />HELL WIT YA-One can tell that this was produced by Shekspere because it has a similar beat to his other hits THERE YOU GO and NO SCRUBS. This could have definitely been a single with its fast and catching beat. Here Pink is telling her cheating lover that he can move on to seomeone new b/c she is done with him. Pink really lets loose vocally on this song allowing us to feel the true anger that she possesses. This is certainly one of my favorites on the disc. A+<br />MOST GIRLS-Second single which has been one of Pink's biggest hits thus far. The song was released in the summer of 2000 which was fitting taken that it is a summer song. As is known, it is great to make choreographed dance moves to and it also has a rockish vibe to it especially towards the end when the guitar riff comes in. While other girls were singing about men paying the bills, Pink was talking about a man who showed real love. A+<br />THERE YOU GO-First single with a NO SCRUBS, SAY MY NAME kind of feel. You can really feel the energy from Pink here and the jittery beat is great making one want to dance. A+<br />YOU MAKE ME SICK-Third single released in the winter of 2000 and beginning of 2001 also promoting the movie SAVE THE LAST DANCE. Here, Pink really does not sing instead flowing which is a combo of singing and rapping, against the bell-backgrounded, smooth beat. Another of my favorites. A+<br />Let Me Let You Know-Midtempo, R&B song that Pink really handles well. For the first time, we get to hear Pink's voice without having the beat dominating. The song does sound old school but it is not out of place here on the CD as is grows on one after repeated listens. A<br />LOVE IS SUCH A CRAZY THING-A mid-tempo, ballad-like song where Pink finally sings about loving someone. The beat is impressive and Pink just ably coasts along on the song fully sounding comfortable as she goes along. A+<br />PRIVATE SHOW-This uptempo song is definitely hip-hop as Pink sounds like someone who is laying the rules down. The beat is once again great and is a good song to dance to. A<br />CAN'T TAKE ME HOME-Truly a fast uptempo hip-hop song that Pink sounds nice on. There are some good background vocals and the song could have definitely been released as a summer 2001 or even spring 2001 single. This is the title track and it lives up to its name. A<br />STOP FALLING-The only \\"real\\" ballad which is very calm and sweet. Pink starts off comfortably in a soft, soprano voice but by the time the song has reached the end we get to hear Pink truly belt it out as she tells someone that she is really not ready for a fully serious relationship. Almost anyone will enjoy this song. A+<br />DO WHAT YOU DO-A midtempo where Pink encourages people to do whatever they feel best that is right. It has a very rappish feel to it and isdefinitely a song that could be rapped to. It is however the weakest track on the CD as many others have mentioned but still good. A-<br />HICCUP-Fast and aggressive song with a very decent hip-hop beat. There is nice interlude where Pink displays some nice vocals. The song definitely works.<br />IS IT LOVE-Another one of my favories where Pink asks if the love she is sharing is real or is it a curse. The beat is certainly unique and Pink easily fits in with the song. An excellent closing song with great backgrounds. There are layers to this song where Pink sings different verses. A+<br />Overall, an A+ with an A enjoyment. This CD is much better than MISSUNDAZTOOD which works very little. My question is how can Pink go from singing this kind of music to that rockish... Definitely buy this CD and be prepared to dance and really enjoy yourself!!
0440539811|5.0|People have said that Wilson's writing is derivative. It is. He borrows from Vonnegut, Burroughs, Pynchon (though not from Gravity's Rainbow which came after this one), Joyce, Aleister Crowley, H.P. Lovecraft, and probably dozens of other brilliant people whom I never would have heard of if not for this book. So therefore I give it 5 stars? No. ... This book's scope is so deep and so broad as to warrant the description encyclopedic. If you read this book you will have opened a can of worms you will not be able, or willing, to close. Your thoughts will change, your sense of humor will change, your very lifestyle could be at risk. So, of course, like the rest of us fools(sic), you'll probably go out and get a copy ASAP. Enjoy!
B00003CXUM|5.0|The film was absolutely mesmerizing. The music, re-creation of 1960's HK, Ms. Cheung's costumes to that incredible closing scene with Mr. Leung's character in Angkor Wat left me breathless.<br />It's a very well-crafted film. But almost too composed. <BR> <BR>There is no sense of spontaneity as with Wong Kar Wai's earlier films, Chungking Express, Fallen Angels and Happy Together most notably. Perhaps it speaks of more restrictive times. <br />It felt like we were watching Wong Kar Wai's childhood memories through rose-colored filters.<br />This film is very richly textured and tighter compositionally than his earlier works. The pace is slow and I kept waiting for something to &quot;happen&quot;. As with all his works it left me yearning for more. This film deserves more than one viewing.
038533348X|5.0|This was once my favorite book. Now I find it at #13 on my all time list (I did Listmania!). It's not that I don't love this book. I do indeed. It's just that it seems so... 5 years ago. Since then my tastes have ripened (pretentious, eh) a bit, and have left little books like this one seeming, well, a bit sophomoric. Still, it is thanks to books like this one that I graduated to bigger and better things such as the work of Thomas Pynchon, Robert Anton Wilson, and Phillip K Dick. So like a girl who's outgrown the puppy love of her high-school sweetheart, and who now favors older men, I've moved on from Cat's Cradle, but I won't forget it.  <BR>What a terrible review! Do I even know what I'm talking about? This is a great book. Anyone who disagrees is flat out wrong. And stupid too.

078062999X|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, and have watched it nearly three times. It is a faithful representation of Shakespeare's text and the visuals are beautiful and make sense. Branagh's performance is outstanding, as are most of the other performances. In particular I appreciated Kate Winslet as a perfect Ophelia, Horatio, and Gertrude.<br />My only fault with the film is the \\"Hollywood\\" gawd. <br />I think it was unnecessary and disappointing to interpret Hamlet's and Ophelia's relationship as highly sexual when the text truly doesn't indicate one way or the other. In my opinion, it takes away from the simple beauty of their former love. I don't want to imagine Ophelia in bed with Hamlet. I do want to understand that they truly loved each other with their hearts and minds and that they would have been someday married lovers.<br />I also disliked the use of several of the well-known actors in bit parts. It feels like a tokenism and I think it would have been best to give smaller parts to lesser known actors (and give them a chance to become better known!) and to offer these veteran actors parts more fitting of their skills. I love Jack Lemmon but didn't feel that I could ever forget that I was seeing the \\"Some Like it Hot/Grumpy Old Men\\" Lemmon in his small Marcellus role.<br />All in all though, I was very moved again and again by the beautiful and touching soliloquies, by the love and friendship between Horatio and Hamlet, and by the lost love and lost life of both Ophelia and Hamlet. It truly is one of the great stories. Hamlet is a magnificently charismatic and intelligent prince, and Branagh does do him justice. Well done indeed!
B000059ZLH|5.0|I always wanted to hear Dream Theater live, but could never seem to get to one of their shows. Being a Dream Theater fan for many years, I ran right out and bought this DVD. All I can say is that I was totally blown away. I always pictured all of the guys sitting down in front of sheet music reading what they are playing because the music is so elaborate and intricate. That is not the case. The members of the band are standing on stage just basically jamming out having a good time and the music is note for note incredible. Being a musician too, I am just blown away of the talent of these individuals. Amazing!

0671027344|3.0|This is a nice book if you're a teenager.  Telling the story of a young, high school kid filled with existential angst, who has trouble finding his place among his peers, it's a cute coming-of-age book.  Teens will relate to this guy is unsure of himself, ayet still wanting to do good.<br />For adults, it's a quick read, but of little intellectual interest.  The use of language, like the story, lacks ingenuity.  I've read pieces by college freshman that were better written.

0345448898|5.0|I have read a lot of Phillip Pullman's books, but this series is by far the best. My favorite book in the series was the first one, the Golden Compass, but I was not disapointed at all by the rest of the books. Some people think the series critisizes the Catholic church. You're not supposed to take it that seriously-that's why they're called fantasy books. This series is extremely good, and I reccomend it to everyone except those who absolutely hate fantasy or science fiction books (although I cannot imagine someone like that).
0743200748|1.0|This might be the creepiest book I have ever read.  Actually the only thing preventing it from being the creepiest book I have ever read is the fact that I have not read it.  My friend warned me about how touchy feely this book is.  The only items in the index were hugging, embracing, males, awkwardness, and heebie jeebies.  When I found out that the book had actually offered to give my friend a back rub, I decided it would be best to blacklist this book.
B000002OX3|5.0|If you read my review for \\"Sings My Generation\\" you know that the thing that made me give it 4 stars was the songwriting. That was The Who's first album and this is their second and I can tell you that the song quality improved so much that I have to give this album 5 stars and big props to Pete Townshend and the rest of the Who who contributed songs to this record. <br />The album starts off with \\"Run Run Run\\" wich is a great song written by Pete and is followed by the creepy crawley \\"Boris The Spider\\" written by John Entwistle. Then comes \\"I Need You\\" written by Keith Moon. Then another song by John called \\"Wisky Man\\" which is hillarious if you pay attention to the lyrics.<BR>Then comes \\"Heatwave\\" which was a cover song that sounds great sung by The Who. Following that is \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\" which is an instrumental written by Keith Moon containing orchestral cymbals, a penny whistle, a trombone, and a trumpet which will definatly wake you up in the morning. Then is \\"Don't Look Away\\" written by Pete, \\"See My Way\\" written by singer Roger Dalrty. And another Pete Townshend song \\"So Sad About Us\\" Track 10, \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" was the last song on the orriginal record. This is Pete Townshend's first crack at writing rock opera's and he came through brilliantly! Track 11 is \\"Batman\\" which is the tune of the batman series and something that is funny the first time you hear it but not something you'd want to listen to again. Track 12 is \\"Bucket T\\" which is quite like \\"Batman\\" and is another cover. track 13 is \\"Barbra Ann\\" and if the name of the song doesn't immediatly pull the chord that lights the thought bulb then maybe if I sang (write) it you'll recognize it:<br />\\"Ba - ba - ba - ba -barbra ann ba - ba -ba ba barbra ann Went to a dance looking for romance, saw barbra ann so I thought I'd take a chance\\"<br />Anyway this is the 4th cover on this album out of 5. The next song is Disguises written by Pete. track 15 is \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" written by John and veryvery enjoyable especially if you like high pitched singing. Track 16 is \\"I've Been Away\\" which is an ok song and my friend tells me is on the Shrek Movie soundtrack. Then is \\"In The City\\" sung by John and Keith without Pete or Roger being there when they recorded it even though Pete later double-tracked guitar on it. It is my favorite song on the album and shows what John and Keith can write. Then is good 'ol \\"Happy Jack\\" though its an acoustic version. It's stil pretty cool. Track 19 is \\"Man With Money\\" which is the 5th cover on the album and is a great song - original is by The Everly Brothers. The final track is \\"My Generation/Land Of Hope and Glory\\" which only goes into the first chorus of my generation before the feedback and then The Who come out of the feedback singing \\"Land Of Hope and Glory\\" in the backround.<br />I have read other reviews on this album and what seemed to be the main problem with what those people think about it is that they graded it low because the Who should have realized that Pete is the only one with songwriting talent. I think exactly the contrary. I gave this album five stars because it was a group effort and the who realized that THEY ALL HAD SONGWRITING TALENT. \\"Whisky Man\\", \\"In The City\\",\\"Cobwebs and Strange\\", \\"I Need You\\" and \\"See My way\\" are all great songs that were NOT written by Pete but by the other members of the band. Personally they are the songs that give the flavour to this record and the humor also. <br />Get this record and you will agree with me if you keep your mond open to the lyrics. Following the review guidlines I would like to say: I Like This Album
B000000Y87|5.0|Listening to this cd is a truly sublime musical experience.  The fact that bassist Scott LaFaro died shortly after this recording is made even more heartbreaking when you hear the music on this album.  While Bill Evans is a consistently brilliant composer and piano player, LaFaro is the true centerpiece of this album.  Listening to his interplay with Motian(drums) and Evans, and hearing the way he weaves his bass melodies in and out of the tune, it is clear that had he not died, he would be considered today one of the most visionary Jazz giants, along with Mingus, Ray Brown, Charlie Haden, Jaco Pastorius, etc etc.  It is a shame that there aren't more recordings of this trio.  If you are a fan of Jazz and of Music, this is a must own cd.
B000006YYW|4.0|GREAT, SUPER FINE POP. BUT HIS 1985 CD &quot;WALLS HAVE EYES&quot; IS EVEN BETTER. THAT ONE IS ALSO CO-WRITTEN WITH MR BARRY ON 8 TRACKS AND PRODUCED BY ROD STEWART PRODUCER TOM DOWD. THAT ONE IS THE BEST &quot;BEE GEES&quot; CD TOGETHER WITH ANOTHER OF COURSE OUT OF PRINT CD, &quot;LIVING EYES&quot;. I CAN ALSO RECOMMEND ONE OF THE FINEST &quot;BEE GEES CDS, EVEN IF ITS ANDYS SOLO, &quot;AFTER DARK&quot;. ON THAT ONE BARRY DID NEARLY EVERYTHING AND IS CLOSER TO A BARRY SOLO CD.
0780625129|4.0|Written by David McKenna and somewhat controversially directed by Tony Kaye, this movie should disturb you with its frightening vision and at the same time entrance you with the wonderful performances. Ed Norton received a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar Nomination this year for the lead role of Derek. The supporting cast includes Edward Furlong, Stacey Keach, and Avery Brooks.  They carry their weight as the story unfolds.<BR> The story is primarily told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong. At the beginning of the story Danny is in trouble yet again for writing a paper on that most misunderstood figure, Adolph Hitler. Danny is an up and coming member of the Skin-Head gang located in that area of California. Avery Brooks, appearing as Danny's principal, doesn't want to give up on the promises he sees in Danny. Instead of throwing him out, he assigns another paper to be written. This is to be on Danny's older brother, Derek, who was just released from prison that morning. Derek was the head of the Skin-Head gang that Danny is currently running with. The rest of the movie flashes back and forth from the past to the present. Through Danny's paper we see how Derek, a brilliant student, is turned into a bitter teen-ager that believes only through \\"white-power\\" will he get anywhere in life. We also see the tragic night that causes Derek to be justly imprisoned. In the present phase of the movie we encounter a Derek who has grown intellectually while in prison and will now do anything to get his brother out of the trap he allowed himself to be drawn into.<BR> Ed Norton is wonderful in this role. Those who have seen him in previous roles remember him to be a good actor but built on a rather slight frame. Here he has bulked himself up to be the \\"Aryan Superman\\" his character portrays. During the time frame of the movie he carries us convincingly on the journey from embitter teenager to enlightened young adult. <BR> Strong warning though. This movie well deserves it's R rating. The subject matter alone is disturbing enough. The story is also visually graphic with scenes of violence and rape. If you are prepared for something like this I highly recommend this movie. The story is extremely powerful and the performances by all are moving. I strongly recommend this one!
B00003CXUM|5.0|first, i'd just like to thank the wonderful people at the criterion collection for releasing important cinema like this on dvd.  i have a vhs copy, and i have a ripped copy from hong kong, but neither of them come close to the quality of this transfer.  if you haven't seen this film, do so immediately!  it captured me.
B00000K19E|3.0|I had a chance to see Andy and Larry Wachowski's ground breaking thrill ride a minute movie, The Matrix, last night. I have to say that as writers the two brothers are very good Directors.<BR>&gt; The story is fairly straightforward. It seems that our reality is not really our reality but a computer generated one and the year is somewhere close to 2200. The computers harvest babies and use them as giant batteries to keep the computer generated world running as they see fit. A<BR>few special people are able to break out of this dream life and begin their battle against the computers. One group, led by Morpheus, is searching for the mythical &quot;One&quot;. A man who will be able to fight the computers with their own strengths and lead humanity back to the pinnacle of life where we once existed. Morpheus believes he has found this person when he finds Neo. The rest of the story details the training of Neo, the discovery of a traitor in their ranks, and the eventual battle between Neo and the Agents of the computer.<BR>&gt; The special effects and the action sequences keep this movie going. Unfortunately nothing truly spectacular occurs in any of these sequences. I am not saying they were bad there have just been better sequences in many other movies.<BR>For the most part the actors do their best with the roles they have been  given. Laurence Fishburn tackles the role of Morpheus and gives the performance we have come to expect from him. He is able to draw attention to himself at any time without saying a word and when he speaks his voice wraps itself around you and transports you away with its power. Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity. She is, in a word, BAD...and that's good. It has been a  long time since we have seen quite as tough a woman in film. Ripley would be proud of her.<BR>&gt; Now we come to Neo. Keanu Reeves has done a good job as an action hero before. This time he is passable but that is all. Some scenes, like when he walks through the metal detector and unleashes an arsenal are great. Other scenes don't work as well. His acting ability has frequently been in question and this is one of those times. The first half of the movie his dazed expression is completely befitting of a character who is bombarded with the information he is receiving. Unfortunately that expression stays on him the rest of the movie. Remember my comments concerning the power of Fishburn's voice? Keanu is not blessed with the same gift. In fact at all times he sounds as if he is stoned beyond belief. <BR>Though the story is silly and meanders off on different tangents I am not saying I disliked this movie. I will say that it wasn't the be all and end all of Sci-Fi/Action movies. However it was relatively entertaining and I am not sorry I went.
B0000634EV|4.0|For those of you expecting extreme thrash metal from the lead singer of Pantera, you will be disappointed.  While there are some riffs that are similar to those from Pantera, Black Sabbath is a much clearer and driving influence (for example the opening riff on track 1).  Overall, this album is worth the money as there are some high quality songs on it.  However, it isn't as good as Nola but then again, how many are?
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie starts quite well with beleivable dialogue and adequate acting.<BR> When Darry and his sister are terrorised on the road by a mini Duel truck, then see the driver of the truck dumping a body down a pipe, you actually care what happens next. Unfortunately, when the cloaked body dumper with the silly hat takes off after them and they manage to completely lose him with the brilliant plan of 'pulling to the side of the road', the warning bells start to chime.<BR> What follows is about an hour of absolute poo. Nothing anybody does or says from this point on makes any sense.<BR> The bad guy turns out to be an extra from Buffy who likes to suck on peoples' tongues. He comes after our two protagonists with the skill and intelligence of a lobster on smack.<BR> After some stupid running around and bad acting, Darry and Wendy (or whatever her name was) find themselves at a police station in the middle of nowhere that has a staff on duty of three hundred and forty, all with riot gear. When confronted by the tongue sucker, this heavily armed mob decides that the best course of action is to look at it for a while.<BR> There are so many holes in the plot of this film that at one point a pointless character explains \\"it doesn't have to make sense, it's not a movie\\", well newsflash nobody: IT IS A MOVIE!!!<BR>This same character is then eaten by the sucker, only to return in the next scene completely unscathed.<BR> This pap goes on until something happens that isn't particularly interesting.<BR> What ever you do do not spend a single dollar on veiwing this [movie] unless you want a lesson on how not to make a horror movie.
6305132984|5.0|My sister, Carol, listened to the LP so often in the early 60's that I thought I could get through my entire life without ever hearing it again.  But Bernstein riffs have POWER, and West Side Story captured the American experience.  The presentation on film (now on video and DVD) is in a category of it's own.  There is nothing else quite like it.<br />I just bought an Apex 1500 DVD from Amazon (they came through like champs, and delivered it short order)  It surprises as I go through the choices of all of film history to view on my new hi-tech gizmo.  So far, the Blues Brothers 2000 (another American Classic) and now \\"West Side Story\\"....  fantastic.  What a solid piece of entertainment.  Very much like an opera.  But and AMERICAN opera.  Captures the 50's 60's feeling very very well.<br />Enjoy it, if I could guarantee it I would... but chances are if you lived through the entire sixties you will identify with this classic piece of art history.  Thanks Carol, thanks for the memories that reconnect me to my Pennsylvania roots and time gone by.  Bernstein's brilliance is so obvious in West Side Story.  See it, and hear it again you won't regret it.  And just<br />in case your up for a double feature, you can't go wrong with \\"Blues Brothers 2000\\"  it's no opera, it's pure R&B fun.
B000002AGB|5.0|After buying this, the best Who album available, go out and buy it on VHS or DVD.  Utterly amazing to watch.  The raw energy is fantastic.  Thats it.<BR>Go out and buy them both NOW.....
0767802470|5.0|This movie captures perfectly the claustrophobia of subsurface warfare. As the destroyers pass overhead dropping blind, killing devices the Germans submariners, unable to see their attackers, sit often in silent fear waiting for the world around them to stop exploding. This must be what the actual German U-boats went through.<br />Fine acting and a top-quality script do nothing but enhance the powerfully understated directing. Everything that happens just seems to naturally occur. The whole thing has something of a documentary feel to it. It also has one of the great tragic endings of all time.
B00003CXI1|5.0|OK, so it's not worthy of a little gold statue.  I'm not rating it against every other movie I've seen in the past year, I'm rating it within it's class.  It is simply a great film for your family to enjoy all together.  I have kids that are several years apart (3 and 9), and, having been exposed to years and years of the same old kids movies, have been longing for new live-action G/PG movies that we can ALL watch and enjoy.   My recommendation -- get it and watch it with your family.  But be sure to share and enjoy the books, too!<br />Note, though, that though I've nearly had my fill of animated kid's movies over the past 10 years, the one this year that really stole my heart -- and was in fact my favorite movie of the year hands down -- was Monsters, Inc.  Disney wins again ;^)
B00005QIPH|5.0|Everyone has needed someone like The Strokes to come around.<br />Finally we have at least one song on the radio (which is in my opinion one of the worse songs on the album) which isn't some overplayed fake NSYNC or PINK junk...<br />The album is original and brings back the sound of rock and roll fading out, when it was what music was supposed to be.<br />All the songs on IS THIS IT have their own sound, and don't get old.  Another great thing about this CD is that no song stinks..., they're all just as good, and deserved to be listened to equally.  Anyone who doesn't like this CD is just someone looking for something to complain about.<br />This is just one step towards a new era of music America has been looking for.
B000002UDB|5.0|So many Beatles albums being excellent, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" seems to have a hard time making it to the top of people's lists. Nevertheless, I am comfortable in saying it is my favorite Beatles album, altho it is in a virtual tie with \\"Sergeant Pepper,\\" \\"The White Album,\\" and \\"Abbey Road.\\" <br />C'mon, detractors, this album contains \\"Fool on the Hill,\\" \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" \\"Penny Lane,\\" and \\"All You Need is Love.\\" The title cut is not bad either, setting a lighter, and brighter, tone. We are given a bright carnival, pleasant for the family. It is true that \\"Mystery Tour\\" does not have much in the way of hard-driving rock songs, which the Beatles do well like all their other stuff, but let's face it, these types of songs account for only a limited portion of people's favorite Beatles tunes anyway.<br />I also like \\"Flying\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way,\\" simple and repetitive, respectively, but nicely done and creating present, dreamy moods. \\"Baby You're A Rich Man,\\" \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\" and \\"Hello Goodbye\\" are on the lighter pop side of things, but the Beatles always do that well too.<br />\\"Fool\\", with its nice woodwinds, is one of the best things Paul ever did, as is the highly evocative \\"Strawberry\\" for John. \\"Walrus\\" has great texture as it zig and zags to fun effect. \\"All You Need Is Love\\" is an authentic 60s anthem, no less. This album is magical, all the way.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is the most amazing movie I have ever seen! Anybody who is an anime fan or movie buff should not be without this movie. Of all the different movies I have seen, big screen & anime, this is my highest reccomendation!
B00005RY7X|4.0|Look.  I'm well aware of how inane and stupid this album is.  And it's the exact atithesis of every jaded 1990's everything-sucks band I've had to put up with as I grew up with the letter X stamped onto my forehead by the Baby Boomers.  This album is our revenge.  Take it or leave it.  <br />Combine 80's bubblegum with Operation Ivy's anger and Def Leppard's polish and listen to it all at Motorhead's volume and you've got this album.  It's never been done before and never been pulled off as well.  That reason alone makes this album important regardless of how trite and meaningless the content is.<br />Believe me, I've got high standards regarding music.  If someone as snobby as me prefers Autechre and Pete Yorn over garbage like Motley Crue and New Kids on the Block, yet STILL likes Andrew W.K., it should say something about this poor guy.
B000063CPL|5.0|...and I don't say that lightly. The band was just on fire that night. The tracklisting is awesome, with a lot of material that hadn't been recorded live before (except on bootlegs), and teh sound is phenominal. All you have to do is look at the tracks to see what's on these discs, but I'm nto sure I've ever heard Maiden this on fire. There's just an edge to the group that's not on any of their other live albums, much less the studio versions, that just puts this album over the edge, from great to incredible. I can't say if it beats Live After Death, but it sure comes close. And compared to the lackluster Live at Donnington, Real LiveOne, and Real Dead One, there's just no comparison. This double disc set just rocks.<br />Oh, and before it's brought up, Steve Harris has publicly stated there were NO overdubs on this album, but on some cases where the audience was singing and it sounded wrong, he cut and pasted Bruce's earlier singing of the same lines for sound quality reasons, but everything on the album was recorded that night, wtih nothing done later.
B00004W5UA|3.0|Brad Pitt and Edward Norton star in this modern age morbid tale of discontent directed by David Fincher.  \\"Fight Club\\" is an orginization that collects all the anger and discontentment of society into one large street fighting gang.  Pitt (Tyler Durgin) is a sleezy projectionist/waiter that entrances Norton who is a low scale desk jockey working for some car company into joining his masquerade in the streets.  The two become enthralled by their creation and soon fight club becomes a weekly ritual, and then, a daily one.  Fight clubs begin to spring up across the country, and soon Durgin is a celebrity within the underworld.  An uncanny relationship with a doped up drug adict teen aged girl tear the bonds between Norton in Pitt.  The movie ends in a strange, apocalyptic and not very satisfying manner.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a good movie, but it will never compare to the Pixar films. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It is lacking in places though. For one thing, the intro is ruined by playing that horrible song All-Star by Smash Mouth. I am so sick of that song. Cameron Diaz was awful as Princess Fiona and didn't seem genuine. Mike Myers didn't seem up to par either. However, John Lithgow and Eddie Murphy were perfect. Anyway, this movie is great. it's funny, it has in-jokes and is perfect for all ages but Toy Story aand all the other Pixar films are better. Pixars characters are lovable and sweet and the actors who voice them make them seem real. But in Shrek the seem phony and not at all lovable.(with the exception of Donkey.)This movie is great. One of the best, but Monsters Inc. should have taken home the Oscar and not this movie.
B000000WA2|5.0|Blur's epic tale of alienation in the modern world is a fascinating and eclectic work that blends different musical styles and thematic moods into a cohesive masterpiece. By combining musical influences from a variety of sources (too many to enumerate) and adding their own immense talent, they manage to create catchy songs that are also profound, unpredictable and dazzlingly elaborate.<br />The music is absolutely brilliant, but it takes second place to Damon Albarn's intelligent and insightful lyrics. The characters are quite impressive, all of them modern stereotypes examined with a depth seldom found in pop and presented in a way that is both satirical and sympathetic. They include the bored suburban wife who runs a little B&B and loves a man in uniform, the successful high flyer who's torn between the realisation of the futility of his life and chemically induced happiness, the fatuous upper class twit who knows all the important people yet cannot help being a terrible bore, and the respectable pillar of society that pinches his secretary's bum and wears knickers under his suit.<br />Damon has a warm and expressive voice that can be sweet, despondent and ironic at the same time, and the rest of the band are just as talented and inventive - guitarist Graham Coxon is particularly effective. Also featured are a string quartet and a horn section and the arrangements are outstanding. The Great Escape is an extraordinary achievement that works both as a collection of catchy songs and as a profound analysis of contemporary society - and that is precisely what pop music is supposed to do.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I love this movie! It is so funny and cute with some of the best music I've ever heard in a movie. The voice acting alone is a reason to see it. Also the story is imaginative and heartwarming. This movie should have won the oscar for best animated picture because it surpasses Shrek on every level in my opinion. And since Shrek won, I'm wondering if the people who picked Shrek even watched Monsters Inc.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira is truly an individual in the pop realm where styles are often copied and songs with the same themes are repeatedly churned out in *slightly* different lyrical format.<br />The first thing that crossed my mind when I saw the video for &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; was that I had never seen anyone dance like Shakira. The bellydancing was a refreshing change from the choreographed BS that we so often see from people like 'NSync and Britney Spears (not that anything is wrong with them, personally). The song itself was like a cold drink of water on a sweltering humid day.<br />Even though the album is generously sprinkled with many musical influences (from funky Spanish dance beats to a bit of electric guitar,) Shakira's voice is perhaps the most noticable instrument on the album, with passion soaring on each note she sings. Her remarkable vocals are especially evident in the song &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;, the most bellydanceable (is that a word?) tune on the album. Watch out Christina Aguilera - Shakira's here to stay.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a good movie to have on DVD, because you'll want to watch it many times to pick up the details and nuance.  Guy Pearce might be a little too pretty for the lead role as a crime victim-insurance salesman, but he's very good nevertheless.  Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are even better in key supporting roles. Telling the story backwards from the perspective of the protagonist (who sustained a brain injury that makes it impossible for him to sustain new memories more than a day) is a clever device that keeps the viewer intrigued and involved--unless you're the type who needs to have stories told in a predictable, linear fashion. You piece together the crime mystery just seconds ahead or (or behind) the protagonist. It was reassuring to see this movie sweep the Independent Spirit Awards, and it wasn't much of a surprise that the Oscars largely snubbed it--giving it just two nominations (and no wins) in the writing and editing categories.  Compare this to something like &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; which some think is so very &quot;creative.&quot;  Well, I like to see creativity with some substance, not just all surface flash. &quot;Memento&quot; satisfies on both the style and substance levels, a real rarity in the commercial film biz today.
B0000039PW|5.0|It isn't very often that a rapper's first release can pack the punch of Notorious B.I.G.'s debut masterpiece, an album that dominated popular radio stations and single handedly had hip-hop fans calling him the newly crowned King of New York.<BR>But that is exactly what Ready To Die, an unapologetic and violent trip through the life of a drug-dealing hustler turned successful rapper, does from its flashback opening to its jaw-dropping finish.<BR>Laying out his album in story form, B.I.G.'s songs range from the hardest of hardcore to the smoothest player anthems found in the music world, all laced over flawless production from various beat makers. <BR>And while Biggie rips the microphone like no other mc can touch him, the thing that truly sets him apart from the other rapping hustlers is how he makes it painfully obvious that he doesn't want to live that kind of life.  In fact, the album's highest moment comes on the triumphant \\"Juicy\\", a rags to riches dream come true that can give hope to even the poorest individual.<BR>Deep, dark and depressing while also carefree, fun-loving and uplifting, the Notorious B.I.G. touches on all emotions with a powerful release that will go down as one of the best of all-time.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Good movie. All what it said about the ending is right, although it is also intersting - how this robot, who developed intelligence and emotions, would live forever with the burden of being sole carrier of the humankind memory? Osment was amazing, I hope he'll continue to amaze us the same way. He seems to be intelligent enough not to succumb to the usual early celebrity vices.<BR>To everyone who liked the idea of the movie (as opposed to its realization) I strongly recommend the works of Stanislav Lem. He developed the problem of interaction of humans and theyr future artificially intelligent creations to the very high level, and many of the images in A.I. seem to have jumped from his books, such as Flesh Fair from Return From The Stars and the scene of the row of hanging David copies and piles of spare parts - from Peace On Earth (same as Matrix, btw, which seem to be directly copied from Lem's The Futurological Congress).
0671024256|5.0|King's book is really three works for the price of one: a condensed autobiography, writing advice, and a reflection on being hit and almost killed by an inattentive driver.  I devoured the book, and read many passages to students in my college writing class.  King pays homage to the classic work on writing, The Elements of Style, the book that anyone who writes anything should have memorized, and the book that his deserves a spot beside.  I found King's work entertaining (read \\"funny\\") and engaging.  Yes, most serious readers and writers have heard most of his advice before, but King's approach is deeply personal and honest.  He shares why he almost abandoned The Stand, and how he solved the problem. He shares his discomfort with plotting a book, with adverbs, and with excessive symbolic or thematic effort -- his preferences, certainly.  He also shares sound fundamental advice with unbridled enthusiasm and energy.  If you care about writing, read this book.
0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the Dead is an extraordinary sequel to his first book Ender's Game.  In this novel, Ender Wiggin is depicted as a lonely worn-down man in his mid 30's.  He lives as a nomad traveling from planet to planet to give the life story of people who have passed away.  Ender receives a call from a young girl who wants him to speak a death on the planet Lusitania.  However, once he arrives at Lusitania, he finds the circumstances have changed.  Ender must strive to be accepted in his new surroundings.<BR>  Card does a remarkable job developing all the characters in this book, particularly the dysfunctional family he becomes involved with on Lusitania.  Though the plot is slow in the beginning as Card sets up his story, it gradually pulls you in until you cannot put it down.  Overall, I thought this book was extremely well written and I highly recommend it.
B00005R2M3|5.0|she's an excellent singer,her songs are excellent, she demonstrates her deep thougts in her songs,she writes them and compose the music and produce, she does everything, by there you find out if someone's a great artist, she has excellent songs, and I also love the fact that she keeps writing in spanish, because by that she's saying that she's latin, and she won't quit it.<BR>Honestly it's an excellent CD, I love all the songs and the mix with different rythms, and she sings great! and dances great!<BR> and she's beautiful. She deserves to be one of the best!!! <BR>And I love the name, Laundry Service, she says that love and music in her life,are like the soap and the water in a laundry service! and I liked that fact.<BR>It's now my favorite CD of all, you should have it too!!!
B00005JKQX|4.0|Russell Crowe plays an amazing mathematician called Dr. Nash in this moving,interesting and absorbing movie that takes us from the years after World War 2 right through to the mid 90's.Dr. John Nash is a brilliant mind in his own particluar field and at first what appears to be someone who has difficulty in social situations soon transforms itself into a man who has been suffering from schizophrenia.I have to say that Crowe is just amazing in the part.I mean it's even better than his oscar winning role in Gladiator-and it is so hard to describe in words how good a performance this is. He is ably supported by Jennifer Connelly who certainly deserves her oscar for playing his long suffering yet very supportive wife as Crowe's condition gradually worsens. The whole thurst of the movie is played off during the paranoia of the early years of the cold war. This is a nice contrast to the delusions that Crowe himself suffers. Here he meets imaginary friends and allies or are they enemies(Ed Harris who plays a secret goverment agent).The pain and suffering endured by the Nash's is well played out-but it is never dealt with in sensational over dramatisation.This gives the whole film a great sense of realism and helps you to empathise even more with Nash and his wife.It's quite an emotional film with plenty of very sad moments,but there are also some really humerous moments to-not least being Dr. Nash and the way he tries to 'chat up' various women in his own unique and straight to the point style.Even though it has got some pretty sad moments there is always this sense of hope as Nash struggles to overcome adversity in his own particular way.So in the end all the characters display moments of true warmth that will leave their memory etched in the minds of the viewer for a long time.This film is a triumph for the human spirit which is acted out brilliantly-rarely have I found the subject of mathematical theories so interesting.But even rarer still is a bio-pic of such rich quality!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is absolutely my favorite artist. <BR>(I also listen to Dispatch, Jack Johnson, Ani Difranco, etc.) <br />Although this CD doesn't do his talent justice, it is a beautiful collection of songs.<br />The lyrics are warming and romantic --- His voice is sexy and smooth --- the songs are catchy and beautiful --- nice guitar and band arrangements. It's hard for me to even choose a favorite song because I've grown to love them all so much --- <br />Give this guy a chance, if you haven't already. it might not be your genre of music but listen and see what you think :) Then go see him in concert and he might just surprise you --- he's amazing.<br />If you don't fall in love with the CD (shame on you!) try downloading some live versions of the songs ------  they make me melt :)
B0000634EV|5.0|I was given as a present a copy of Down-NOLA when it came out and to this day it is by far one of my all time favorites. Down 2 in my opinion surpasses NOLA on all fronts. It is of course heavier...but more dirty, darker, and I hate to use the word, but more experimental. I recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of great music or a fan of Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar, Eye Hate God, Black Sabbath, St. Virus, or any given SOUTHERN ROCK band. I'll see at Sunset Station in SA,TX in May. Long live true rock n' roll!
B00005R87Q|5.0|\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is nothing more than a sheer intensified thrill ride that will have you clenching your teeth from start to electrifying finish! With just as much exciting action as director Renny Harlin's \\"Driven\\", the direction of Rob Cohen (\\"Daylight\\", \\"The Skulls\\") was just as exciting as ever! Producer Neal H. Moritz (\\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\") did a splendid job in bringing this hot-rod of a movie to the big screen! <br />\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" focuses on the following:<br />Saturday night. Midnight. A deserted street in a lonely industrial wasteland on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Suddenly, a mighty roar. The air is filled with the sound of turbo-charged horsepower, coming from under the hoods of dozens of colorful Japanese and German subcompacts and sports cars which quickly pull into the street and create an illegal drag strip a quarter-mile long. These customized vehicles are driven by men and women, mostly in their twenties, representing all races and nationalities. They walk around and admire each other's handiwork before getting down to the business at hand--finding out who has the fastest car of them all...as \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" welcomes you to the worls of import street racing.<br />Unlike the classic American street racers depicted in films like \\"Rebel Without A Cause\\" and \\"American Graffiti\\", the racers in \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" rely on computers, fuel injectors, nitrous oxide boosters, and other high-tech equipment to power their \\"rice rockets\\" to speeds of over 150 mph.<br />Vin Diesel (\\"Pitch Black\\", \\"XXX\\") stars as Dominic Toretto, the leader of a pack of street racers who drives the streets of L.A. as if he owns them. As far as his crew, including his girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez, \\"Resident Evil\\"), are concerned, he does. The races are their street theater, tribal gathering, and battlefield, fuelled by adrenaline and out-of-control speed. A newcomer named Brian Spilner (Paul Walker, \\"Joy Ride\\") is ready to test the limits. He seeks Dominic's approval. After a blazing encounter in L.A.'s Chinatown with ruthless street racer Johnny Tran (Rick Yune, \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\"), Dominic decides that Brian is alright. Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster, \\"The Faculty\\") likes what she sees, too. The thing is, they don't know that he's a cop...and his real name is Brian O'Conner. Brian is undercover, investigating a series of big-rig hijackings. Dominic and Tran are both suspects. As the rivalry between Dominic's and Johnny Tran's crews escalates, Brian's bonds with Dominic and Mia deepen. But he's still a cop and as the pressure to wrap up the hijacking case intensifies, Brian must decide where his loyalites lie and what his limits really are.<br />The DVD format of \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" was amazing! With deleted scenes, camera angles of the final car stunt scene, and lots more, this is the DVD that anyone must own...right now! With a great young cast that's hard to beat, fast cars, super-charged action and suspense, and an electrifying soundtrack, you'll agree that \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is the most thrilling ride you'll ever take!
038533348X|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut is nothing short of a magician. Call him a writer if you must, but it seems unfitting for a man who weaves yarns about new religions, Ukranian midget dancers, apocalyptic chemical inventions, and feet-rubbing fornication. Writer just doesn't do justice.<br />Regardless, Cat's Cradle is a wonderful read and a heck of a time. Plot, character, and setting, as always in Vonnegut's work, take a back seat to the infectuos humor and unconventional writing style of its author.<br />The narrator is named Jonah, a writer who wishes to conduct a non-fiction story revolving the lives of people surrounding the Atom Bomb titled \\"The Day The World Ended\\". From this moment, our wild ride begins as we are introduced to the great cast of characters, including Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the so-called \\"Fathers\\" of the Atom Bomb, who may or may not have created a chemical capable of turning all the worlds water supply into ice, his family, the president(dictator)of a small Pacific Island San Marcos, Papa Manzano, and his lovely daughter, all the way down to Bokonon himself, founder of the Bokonon faith which is based in foma (lies). The journey through Vonnegut's mind is a worthwile one, if nothing else for his startling creativity, and hilariously bleak view at humanity. I will leave you with this quote from the great books of Bokonon:<br />\\"Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before. He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way.\\"<br />Well said.
0553260111|5.0|...one of the best books I've ever read<br />Suspense. Intricate, but believable plot. Good character development. Excellent.<br />Overview:  CIA Operative with amnesia tryings to discover who he is.<br />Opinion:<BR>It is difficult to keep a plot based on amnesia from getting too much like bad TV, but Ludlum pulls it off.<br />The twists and turns when this very solid storyline made this book difficult to put down.  Further development of Carlos's character would have been nice, but you can't have everything.<br />...a Classic.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I WOULD REAALY LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVIE COME OUT ON DVD.I LOVE THIS MOVIE I REALLY THINK IT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE BY JOHN TRAVOLTA,ALSO MY MOMS. WE COULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN IT IS ON DVD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
0525946284|3.0|...got the audio book from Blockbuster to pass the time during a road trip with the family.<br />Overview:<BR>Female Allied spies on a sabotage mission behind enemy lines in France just prior to D-Day.  Based on a true story.<br />Opinion:<BR>Decent plot, really paints a good picture of the brutal realities of occupied France during WWII and covert ops.  <br />Lacked deep character development and the complexity of better novels in this genre.  Good big screen movie candidate (which normally means bad book)<br />Not in the league of classic Ludlum, Clancy, etc.<br />I liked Follett's &quot;The Third Twin&quot;, this one was a bit of a disappointment.
0425074811|4.0|This book is really an interesting read.  It dares to go outside the theories of conventional achaeologists and historians, to postulate whether primitive cultures had contact with alien life forms.  The author presents this theory in a well thought out fashion, first with the concept of \\"well why not?\\"  As unscientific as a theory as it is, he later goes in depth to describe inexplicable findings in areas inhabited by these earlier cultures, and the similarities with cultures from elsewhere in the world at that time.  Interesting stuff! Although I am not thoroughly convinced in the ancient astronaut theory, I am a believer that it could explain some otherwise inexplicable details.
B00003CXWV|5.0|...This is one of the best dramas ever created.  some...thought traffic was much better. hah!...if you want a really good story that stays in reality, ie. (not characters that turn from a rich little schoolgirl into a [prostitute] that [works] for heroin within the timeframe of about 2 weeks) then buy blow.  i garantee you will find it a compelling and powerfull story.  O_o  o_O
0871137380|5.0|&quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; by Mark Bowden is the true story of WHAT our noble men and women in the Armed Forces put their lives on the line to do, as seen through the example of our battle in Somalia. I recommend that everyone read this book.  I also recommend &quot;West Point: Character Leadership ...&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. It's the true story that explains WHY they do it.
B00003CXXR|3.0|This is a fairly decent film.  Dinosaurs, mayhem, and action are all abundant but . . ..  The reasons for the continued contact with the dinosaurs is especially thin in this movie.  Not only that, they've stretched the believability factor too much when it comes to the intelligence of the Raptors.  It was bordered on laughable.  Also stretching the imagination and the plot is one large dino that follows the stranded characters everywhere.  Amazing how a dino as big as two buildings could sneak up on you repeatedly with success.  He even manages to hide in some rather shallow water.  There are so many inconceivable occurrences in the movie that I can give it only 3 stars.  It's a very disappointing contribution to the series.  Watch only when there is nothing else on television.
0399103422|5.0|Ok, I've seen the movies and now I've finally read the book.  Not only does it make me appreciate how fantastic the original GODFATHER film was/is, but I was blown away by how fantastic the book is...even/especially now!  Absolutely compelling from start to finish, exquisitely researched and written.  What a story!  What characters!  And even though I experienced the film and book in reverse chronology, they are perfect companions...  I'm compelled to read more Puzo, yet worried I may be let down...this was so much fun!  (if all that bloodshed and gore can be  FUN)  If you haven't read it, do so!  If you have, do it again!
6304414145|5.0|This film is not just a thriller.  It is a deep psychological thriller.  Instead of relying on action this movie stands firmly on the emotions of an impressive gathering of some of the greatest actors ever: Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise, and Delroy Lindo.<br />My only real complaint is that the final action sequence seemed delayed a little too long, and then occurred too simply.<br />But don't let that shake the movie.  There are still tears enough to drown in; rage enough to burn down the house; and suspense enough to stop the clock!
6304316267|4.0|Hal Needham directs this 1981 box office \\"runaway\\" hit, which features an all-star cast. Needham spares no expense in maximizing the physical car chase ambience, except, unlike his prior pictures which also feature Burt Reynolds (i.e. the first two \\"Smokey And The Bandit\\" movies, \\"The Cannonball Run\\" (for the most part) lacks the physicality of the car crashes that were an integral part of the \\"SATB\\" flicks. Instead, Needham relies on some dirty-pool interplay between various contestants to add to the cross-country racing element. There's still plenty of action to be had, however, as Needham does a splendid job in bringing everything together, including the somewhat exhausting job of bringing a unique and well-known array of celebrities. Some of these standout entertainers featured in \\"The Cannonball Run\\" include the likes of Dean Martin and fellow \\"Rat Packer\\" Sammy Davis, Jr. as well. Jack Elam, Mel Tillis, Terry Bradshaw, Dom DeLuise, Burt Reynolds and even a young, up-and-coming Jackie Chan also come along for the ride in this free-for-all run for some big bucks (and not to mention some FAST women!!!). The race is on from New Jersey to California, as everyone is out to claim the big prize, no matter what the cost. The closing moments, as well as the bloopers featured in the final credits, make \\"The Cannonball Run\\" well worth the purchase. So, race on down to your local retailer, and order this souped up vehicle today, or you'll be left at the finish line (in last place, with nothing to show for it, of course)!
068484267X|5.0|One might question the sanity of a person who could laugh at the painful impoverishment depicted in Angela's Ashes, but I shamelessly laughed out loud many times.<br />McCourt's memoir is so cleverly written that good readers are sure to see his bittersweet tongue in his cheek as he uses humor to recover from a woeful childhood.  I think the moral of the story is that if he can survive the Irish perdition, there is much hope for all of us.<br />WARNING: the movie does little justice to this fine work by McCourt.
B0000399WI|5.0|I hate sugary films that only want to make the viewer feel good about himself under the most superficial pretenses.  I hate films that are abnormally long - movies that try and convince the viewer of its greatness just because of its length. I hate prison movies - they are melodramatic, unrealistic, and a cliche.<br />The Shawshank Redemption, however, is nothing less than remarkable, and in the end, deserving of its finale.
6305127646|5.0|I think we're mostly familiar with the story of this movie, but I'll recap briefly: A thief is sent to steal a scientific formula from a nerdy-but-gorgeous physicist, but he falls in love with her. He deceives her, she tracks him down, there's a lot of chases, and oh yeah, there's a revolution going on around them. The fun part: The thief is noble at heart, a master of quick-changes and impersonations, and always picks for his personae the names of Catholic saints (a rather telling calling-card, if you ask me, but the movie asks us to \\"forget\\" that any criminal profiler would catch that within 30 seconds).<br />It's a romp of a movie. There's definite chemistry between Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue, the leads, and it's delightful to see Kilmer's various personae, how different they all really are. The movie drags a bit in the middle (and honestly, the entire beginning sequence could have been left out safely), but it picks up again. There are some fascinating characters in here, most particularly the greedy \\"art dealer\\" Frankie, who steals every scene she's in. Unfortunately, the bad guys aren't among the fascinating -- both are two-dimensional and stereotypical. But there's plenty to compensate for the movie's shortcomings. A chase scene involving Shue trying to reach the American embassy is among my favorites in movie history. The sets are very cool. The acting is fairly solid, bad guys aside. There's a lot of eye candy here, and not all of it is Val Kilmer in leather pants posing as a South African artist.<br />The DVD version doesn't include a ton of goodies (a commentary and the trailer), but the picture and sound quality are excellent. Well worth the money.
B00005B36H|5.0|I don't know very much about music..arrangment..and actually the elements that make Tool a great band...but I do know that when I listen to this album I feel like for a moment I'm not in this world, filled with anger, hate, revenge....Tool's music to me is like an escape from the world. What if the world was a better place, where no one had the weakness the album talks about. What if all that was important was your loved ones, your friends, and good music.  To me that would be Heaven, and for a moment Lateralus<BR>gives that to me. I'm not a music expert but I know good music when I see it. I think music is simple...it's a language that delivers something way more powerful than words alone, emotions. Good musicians can speak this language so eloquently, Tool is simply a great band.
0452282152|5.0|This was the most intriguing book I've read in some time.  I couldn't put it down.  It put me right into the life of the 15th century character.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Fresh plot and a little history around the working class as well as the wealthy class attitudes of a distant time.
0066620996|5.0|To learn about firms that were able to markedly improve their financial performance, I recommend &quot;Good To Great&quot; by James C. Collins. It is a study of leadership, THE PRACTICALITIES, in those firms. If you find &quot;Good To Great&quot; interesting and informative, I recommend that you also read Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point: Character, Leadership, ...&quot; for a study that will give you the leg up of understanding leadership, THE PRINCIPLES, that can be applied to any organization you are now, or will be, leading in your career.
B00005JKED|5.0|Having just purchased this film, i think it is one of the finest films denzel has ever made, i was gripped from the first scene.<BR>Utterly fantastic please make more like this.<BR>You deserved the oscar
0743216458|5.0|I still have not seen the HBO mini-series yet, so I cannot compare the book to the series. This book is very entertaining and I would recommend it for anyone interested in WWII, war stories, and heroic tales.  It is one of the top 5 books I have read in my life.<br />Easy company's (an elite airborne unit) exploits are recreated by a series of interviews with the soldiers, old letters, manuscripts, and a few reference books. Ambrose weaves the myriad of information into a coherent and fast-paced story. The book gives the reader an idea of the terrors of war and many accounts of heroic actions taken by men (some scared some not) when put into the most difficult of situations. There is always a price to pay for freedom and the defeat of evil. The men that are described in the book all seem overly modest; they are all heroes in my book. God Bless the USA!
B00003CY5J|1.0|With a cast full of great actors and a classic plot this should have been an excellent movie.  However, it moved painfully slowly  towards an overly abrupt ending.  Norton did a great acting job which often causes viewers to consider this a quality movie.  He is so good that often the nonsensical ending to the movie is overlooked.  If you believed that this was a good movie I ask you to watch it once more and try to imagine how the heist could possibly be pulled off in that manner, there are siply too many flaws to deal with.  Feel free to watch this movie, but please think about it before you take the slow paced plot as a sign of quality.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I try to listen to this CD everyday. I drew a pencil picture of India and it was praised by everyone I know.<BR> This girl has wonderful vocals, perfectly matched with her soulful R&amp;B songs. My favorites on the album are obviously 'Video', that's my song!, 'Promises' is absolutely fabulous, and of course, 'Brown Skin' is sultry and very beautiful.<BR>  The only track that's a little...unmusical(?) would be 1., which is an intro describing a list of 'in-remembrance' African American artists. It would be better written than sang, for sometimes it's a bit hard to incorporate names into a song.
B00005OWIU|2.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the best soundtracks I own, and I own Lord of the Rings, Monsters Inc., Jurrasic Park, Star Wars, and A.I.(just to name a few).  Yes, many parts of the score sound just like the other John Williams's scores like Jurrasic Park and Star Wars, but he has finally perfected his writing. John Williams has outdone himself on this score. When I listen to this music, I do not feel as if it is a soundract to a movie; rather, I feel as if he did not even have the movie in mind.  The music flows perfectly, never stopping aprubtly. It creates a music statement that brings to life all the events and characters of Harry Potter and the Sorcere's Stone.  I suggest this CD to anyone who loves the way John Williams writes, any Harry Potter fan, and anyone who loves classical music.  John Williams, you've outdone yourself!
0553277472|5.0|To be honest, this book's popularity amazes me.  I first read it when it came out in 1974-I was 21 and in college-and, despite the fact I liked the book a lot I couldn't fathom how it ever became a mass market success.  Here we are 28 years later and it's in the Top 1000 Amazon sellers.  Amazing.<br />Obviously, if you've read previous reviews, you realize this is a divisive book, seen as either revelatory or insipid.  <br />The book is heavily philosophical in tone, but at heart it's about finding your allegorical life device.  (Had the book been written 20 years later, we'd have used the term paradigm.)  For this character, it's motorcycle maintenance.  That's not particularly profound, but then, really, not much in life is when you get right down to it.<br />I think a big part of the problem is that people forget this is fiction Admittedly, it's heavily autobiographical and pretentious fiction, but fiction nonetheless.  This isn't Bertrand Russell or Kant or Martin Heidegger writing an academic tract meant to profoundly influence the world of philosophical thought.  Moreover, anyone who went to college must have somewhere along the line been exposed to a similar character-someone full of his own importance and questions and semi-educated the way undergrads are in philosophy, perpetually blowing his horn.<br />The other thing that never seems to get mentioned that is, to me, a key element that underlies and drives this story is that early on we learn the man has just gotten out of the loony bin having been subjected to electroshock therapy.  The man's brains have been artificially addled and he's trying to put things in some sort of order.  An allegorical device makes a lot of sense in this context.<br />On the whole this is an entertaining and thought provoking story-the way that, say, Ayn Rand wrote interesting, thought provoking, heavily allegorical yet somewhat unrealistic stories.<br />If you approach the book in that light, I can't see how you can help by enjoy it.
B00005QZWI|2.0|I am not the rock, pop, country, or rap kind of person, and I think classical music is kind of boring.  So, my main draw is soundtracks.  Every time I see a movie and hear an awesome theme from the music, I immediately go out and by the soundtract.  Well, when I went see Lord of the Rings, the music sounded so breathtaking that I went buy the CD.  The music is horrible standing alone from the movie.  It was so repetitive!  I could sing the parts in the later tracks the first time I listened to the CD.  There are a few good moments(the only reason I gave it two stars was for this), but the rest of the soundtrack is plagued by horrible endings to songs, terrible melodies, and did I mention the music being repetitive yet?  I recommend this soundtrack to NO ONE!  If you really want music about Lord of the Rings, I highly suggest Symphony No. 1 inspired by The Lord of the Rings by Johan De Meij. I do not know why Howard Shore did not use the themes from Meij's work which was based on the books.  The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings soundtrack was such a diappointment!
B000002KIK|5.0|You can weed out the poser Sabbath fans from the seasoned veterans by bringing up this album.  Rather than go out with a whimper, Sabbath's last album with Ozzy in 1978 was one of their best.  Never Say Die! stays true to Sabbath's early heaviness while at the same time stretches the band's sound into the jazz realm that drummer Bill Ward came from.<br />Tracks like \\"Never Say Die!\\" \\"Johnny Blade\\" and \\"Shock Wave\\" are Sabbath at their thrill-up-the-spine rock and roll best, while tracks like \\"Air Dance,\\" and \\"Breakout\\" show the band pushing their sound into a new direction that never got explored further due to Ozzy's departure from the lineup.  One of the album's guttsiest tracks, \\"Swinging the Chain,\\" even has drummer Bill Ward howling some mean vocals (with Ozzy playing a mean harp).<br />Never Say Die! is a rock and roll classic that no heavy music fan should be without.
B00005JKL8|2.0|Whenever a movie claims to be based on a true story, BEWARE. This movie is classic US propaganda. America is all alone in the world and can rely on no one but itself. Even when we try to help another country, they hate us. The individual is all, damn the big picture. For every US soldier killed or wounded, about 100 of the enemy have to die. The enemy is just that, the enemy: pure evil, no shade of grey. I do give this movie 2 stars because the action is non-stop and it isn't a boring movie to watch. Also, it's one of those movies that is so bad it is almost good. If only the realities of the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in Bosnia weren't so tragic.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|My wife and I cannot get enough of it. The movie was extraordinary and the sound track does it justice. We also own the second soundtrack, which is an excellent addition to owning this one. If you like romantic, grandiose musicals you will love this one. Similar in many ways to Phantom of the Opera.
0452282152|5.0|Of all the fiction that has come out recently featuring Vermeer or Vermeer paintings, this was my favorite. I don't know how she did it, but somehow the author's prose seems to be a reflection of the paintings themselves. The charged relationship between the fictional Vermeer and the servant girl (the narrator of the story) was very convincing. It also made clear that the options of women during this era, even those with interest and talent,  were claustrophobically limited. Although I usually don't care for fictionalized versions of historical figures, this book rang very true.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I've about had enough of illiterate adolescents who think that there is some problem using Elton's classic \\"Your Song\\" in Moulin Rouge - get a clue! It's anime! The entire movie is a phenomenal roller coaster, a feast of eye candy, a hauntingly tender love story, a masterpiece. The skillful blending of contemporary music, images and film making with the fresh-coat-of-paint-grotesquery of Paris circa 1900 is stunning, and the love story is pure enough to break the coldest of hearts.<br />Make no mistake, this is an art film and should not be seen if you are in the mood for Indiana Jones or Basic Instinct. Additionally, we have had several friends borrow our copy of the DVD and HATED it because they watched it on really small televisions. I think that it should be seen on a large screen with a reasonable sound system or it may come across just a little too frenetic. We have a 53\\" 6x9 with surround that does the film justice. The sound is marvelous. <br />My wife and I think that this piece could be described like this: a turn-of-the-century Parisian Romeo and Juliet produced by MTV and directed by the same person who did the Rocky Horror Picture Show. If you like Strictly Ballroom (another Baz Luhrman film) you'll LOVE THIS.
B000002KIE|1.0|I hate the Sex Pistols.  I bought the album and then sold it the next day.  \\"Isssss this tha uk-yah!\\".  SHUT UP!  I can't listen to that annoying whine without gritting my teeth and stabbing my ears.  Screw their faux rebel image and wanna be Stooges riffs.  You Pistols fans think you're any better than the 12 year old girl next door with the Sum 41 shirt?  They're a joke and so are you.  My only regret is that I couldn't give this album 0 stars.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
B000062Y98|5.0|BG's previous album was released in 1998 and people from power/speed metal circles said it was going to be impossible to match the greatness of that album with any future release.<BR>I claim that 'A Night at the Opera' outmatches Nightfall in some aspects. ANATO lacks the album-wide theme that NIME had. I dont see it necessary as bad thing. It gives the album more diversity.<BR>The guitar arrangments on this album are extremelly complex. I've read that it took BG 4 months of hard studio work to  put together 'and there was silence'. BG's work ethic is unbelievable - things only take them long because they always strive for perfection. <BR>The only thing that i find a bit less appealing on this album is the fact that most lyrics are sung as choir. It kind of gets old after a while. <BR>However, do not let anyone tell you that this album is not worth a buy! <BR>Finally, i'd like to say: &quot;Bravo, Blind Guardian&quot;.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I first heard Bjork at my big sister's house.  Her daughter is a Bjork fan, and sometimes had her music playing when I was there. I was instantly attracted, but held off on buying any CDs because I knew I would probably need to buy ALL of her music (it just sounded so good), and I didn't have a lot of disposable income at the time.  <br />But a few months ago I ended up buying Dancer in the Dark as my first Bjork CD because it was playing in the record store, and I realized I finally had to have this woman's music.  Suffice to say that I did not waste my money.  Every song here is a gem.  Something in her music communicates with my soul on some subliminal level.  It's like when you fall in love with someone and find yourself being able to communicate without any effort at all.  <br />&quot;Scatterheart&quot; is my favorite.  Dark and mysterious, the lyrics pull you in and tell an important story.  I especially like the way the bass line seemingly ignores the melody line, but ends up complementing it when the song is viewed as a whole.  <br />In addition to this album, I also own Debut and Post.  I have listened to all three many times, and can honestly say that every single track Bjork has produced is a thing of beauty.  She is the most original and creative artist I've heard in a long time.  If you have an open mind and are looking for something different, Bjork will take care of you every single time.
0399230033|5.0|This book is magical as it touches the soul and brings one as a parent back to the time when we were young.  Oh, wonderful, enchanting, endearing, lovely, amusing, and comical are only a few words that we can use to describe the delight we have felt reading this book to our young sons.  God has blessed the author with the gift and craft of not only touching children but touching parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and friends as well with pure, young, whimsical delight with this beautifully simple book!

0060187557|3.0|History and hindsight have added a dimension to reading Nimitz Class.  It's March 2002 and I've just finished a book originally published in 1997 and set in 2002.  A terrorist plot that may have seemed outlandish at the time seems more plausible in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  Are there people in the world as evil as the book's villain, Ben Adnam?  Yes, there are, we've learned, capable of killing thousands of people in a single horrendous act and instigating war in the Middle East.  Some elements of Nimitz Class presaged curious parallels in real life:  a conservative and decisive President from the Southwest who makes tough and aggressive military decisions; the forming of international military alliances and actions involving the UK, Russia, Israel; the categorizing of Iraq and Iran (among others) in an international terrorist \\"axis of evil.\\"<BR>  All that having been said, the execution of this book is incredibly irritating! The President's address to the nation following the destruction of the aircraft carrier Thomas Jefferson is frankly pitiful, as are numerous other monologues.  I almost trashcanned the book right then were it not for the next story twist.  Author Robinson saves himself by spinning a good yarn, however illogical at points.  Because Robinson thinks up some interesting story lines, I'll be taking Kilo Class and H.M.S. Unseen along to read on a vacation cruise next month, but if the general sloppiness exhibited in Nimitz Class continues, those copies may end up hurled over the rail and floating in the Caribbean.  The Nimitz Class manuscript deserved a good polishing.  It didn't get it.<BR>  The author really needs a good editor.  By rushing this book into print for a quick buck, the people at HarperCollins missed an opportunity to help the author create a best-seller in the Tom Clancy genre.  Am I going to find more of the same in Robinson's future books?

B00005QZ7U|2.0|It is odd that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" should win eight academy award nominations.  Not only is it not as good as \\"The Others\\" or \\"A.I.\\" but, more important from the academy's perspective, it did not make as much money as either of them.  It no doubt was helped by the fact that, while not an innovative and pathbreaking new movie, it strongly resembled Hollywood's idea of one.  Where other movies offer the euphoria of something truly original, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" provides frenzy and sensation for its own sake.  Whereas other movies offer a new perspective, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" indulges weird anachronism.  Why should the average moviegoer be expected to know think about Fin de siecle Paris, in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair, or as anarchism and marxism clashed for the soul of French socialism, or as a certain Catholic nationalism poised to mutate into something too close to fascism?  Why should the average moviegoer be reminded that this was the time of Proust and Gaugin and Debussy, of the first cinema industry and the Curies?  Best provide people with what they think they know, even if Toulouse-Lautrec is reduced to saying cliches about \\"love, truth, beauty and freedom.\\"<br />Musicals are nothing without music.  What Luhrmann has done is create the first musical where the main focus is on the editing.  Not editing for any particular purpose, not to show any emotion or even enthusiasm but as an exercise in his own virtuosity.  The results are scattershot.  There is an amusing cameo by Kylie Minogue as the Tinkerbell Absinthe Fairy.  The scene where the characters hoodwink the duke into supporting their ridiculous Spectacular is amusing.  Jim Broadbent does an amusing version of \\"Like a Virgin,\\" that matches Quientin Tarantino's riff on it in \\"Reservoir Dogs.\\"  Broadbent is helped by the fact that most people do not have strong feelings for the song.  And if you ever wanted people to sing \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" in turn of the century France, well, here's your chance.<br />It's not enough.  There is the worst version of \\"Roxanne\\" I've ever heard, done as a particularly bombastic tango.  John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec is excruciating, though that might be the script's fault.  But the main problem is the love story at the focus of the movie.  The story is a cliche, so Luhrmann seeks to drown it in heavy irony.  The sentimental can still believe in the story, people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing can pride themselves on their hip irony, and those in between can be manipulated accordingly.  It doesn't work.  How can we believe that the main characters are in love when Luhrmann doesn't, and doesn't want us to?  Nicole Kidman actually does a good job given the hopeless position she is put in, but Ewan McGregor is singularly unconvincing.  In my opinion I don't think \\"Your Song\\" is so irretrievably bad that it can never be affecting if sung with conviction.  But since Luhrmann doesn't care, what can McGregor do when he warbles it?Rather unpleasant in the manner that it has it both ways, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" reminds one of D.H. Lawrence's verdict on John Galsworthy:  \\"Vulgarity pays, and cheap cynicism covered in sentimentality pays better than anything else.\\"
B00003CXTG|3.0|The special effects are flawless and some of the best i've seen.That didn't come close to its epic proportions is what'll probably disappoint viewers most.It did me.Hopefully,the importance of the event itself was not lost or trivalized.If you have to ask why its important,than you wouldn't understand anyway.
B00005JKED|5.0|Once Denzel Washington picked up the Oscar for Best Actor, me and my buddy Ry decided it was time to see what all the fuss was about - that and the fact that the trailer showed that both Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre were in the movie. That aside, I'd recently been watching a lot of the PBS presentation of Joseph Campbell and \\"The Power of Myth\\" which enhanced and coloured my enjoyment of \\"Training Day\\". For, it seems apparent that the story of the film draws on the basic myth/religious story of the temptation of the hero, the descent into hell, and the choice between damnation and salvation. Denzel and Ethan Hawke play their roles of tempter and tempted with great vivacity and depth, drawing us once again into a time-tested myth, this time set in the Los Angeles drug scene.<br />\\"Training Day\\" begins with a look at Jake's (Hawke) cozy home, beautiful wife, and settled life, all of which will be unsettled in the day that follows. Assigned as an apprentice of sorts to a narcotics detective, Alonzo (Washington), Jake is given one day to see whether he is cut out for high stakes narc work. Alonzo quickly puts Jake through his paces, trying to inculcate the philosophy that in the narc game, one has to be willing to live and operate according to the same rules as the enemy, and to all appearance, become the enemy. Jake's innocence and idealism cause him some hesitation and reticence about following Alonzo's example. <br />This is the mythological trope, though, and the point that the film turns on - Alonzo tells Jake that if he plays the game right, and is willing to split his personality and his objectives - to be a \\"wolf\\" and abandon his essential self while he's on duty, Jake can make detective in 18 months. Alonzo sanctions murder, theft, and deceit, and offers Jake a kingdom in return for his principles. The way the conflict manifests itself internally within Jake and externally between Jake and Alonzo is compelling and deeply moving, especially as Jake finds himself beingdrawn in by Alonzo both by and against his own will. <br />\\"Training Day\\" gives us a multifaceted perspective on narcotics investigation. We see it from the point of view of the drug dealer, Roger, who is simply looking forward to retirement; from the users themselves, including an appearance by Snoop Dogg; from Alonzo's 'team' of narc agents, including Dr. Dre; and the multicultural views of the black and hispanic communities through which the drug trade passes through and infects. Recalling the opening scene with Jake and his wife, we are presented with Alonzo's 'second family,' a mistress and a small boy - this alternate life Jake must weigh, negotiate, and come to terms with in order to save himself. Jake also finds that he must learn the language and the mannerisms of the streets - governed by loyalty, reciprocity, and exchange - and find a way to keep himself above it, if possible.<br />The DVD of \\"Training Day\\" is full of really high-quality extras. In most DVD's I've seen that have bonus/deleted scenes, the extra moments you get aren't worth watching. Not so here. There are at least three scenes, not to mention the alternate ending, which give even further complexity to the main characters and their fraught relationship. They are so good, I believe they should have been left in the movie, but since they weren't, it's good to have them in the DVD. Absolutely a DVD worth owning, and a movie well worth seeing several times. Washington's performance is sparkling, riveting, and wholly believable, as he plays a tempter caught up in his own intrigues. Hawke is also very good in his role, but it is really no different (save in degree) from the doe-eyed innocent thrown into a cruel world that he's been doing since \\"Dead Poets Society\\". Not to undercut his performance; of course, with all that practice, he does a terrific job. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and has some great special effects.I recommend this movie to you,but there's a 90 minute love story in the movie that you might not like
0385505833|1.0|Grisham should be ashamed of this book, which is complete drivel.  I couldn't stand any of the characters, ESPECIALLY the protagonists.  Whiny, spoiled housewife and narcissistic, spineless, rude accountant - what's not to like there???  By the middle of the book, I was actually looking forward to their trip being ruined!  Completely unbelievable scenarios and dialogue throughout (what planet do these people live on??), capped with an utterly ridiculous ending. (We're supposed to consider Luther a hero because he gave away something that he wasn't going to use anyway??  Um, o.k.)  What a waste of time and money - like something from a middle school creative writing class.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I love this movie,it was such a tear jerker.Plus it didn't get any better than Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett in the same movie.Kate Beckinsale was gorgeous as well.
B00005RIKD|5.0|This is a very good collection of new interpretations of his work. Listen with a new ear.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is excellent and the best movie since Titanic.The plot and the action made me laugh and cry all the way through.Please go see this movie.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Okay, there are two kinds of people pertaining to this album.  One, you're a pretentious wanna-be music critic who thinks it's too predictable.  You THINK (read:think) you know a lot about music.  Two, you can appreciate the forest for the trees and come to embrace the cheesy riffs, terribly juvenile lyrics, and partypartyparty atmosphere.  I am no newcomer to music, and I love alternative like Radiohead or the Shins, but sometimes you are in the mood for a movie like American Beauty, and sometimes you want to see The Rocky Horror Picutre show.  This CD is, in every sense of the word, the latter.  So put away the Thesauras, turn off the German &quot;experimental&quot; music, and listen to some in your face, cheesy music that may be terrible, but just came along at the right time.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I thought this movie is very good and sad.I don't care what critic's say,Pearl Harbor is great.
0375751513|2.0|The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel.  The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far.  Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it.  It ends in a tragedy.  In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely.  I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel.  The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.)  Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the best movie i've seen since Saving Private Ryan.It will surly top the charts and even Titanic.This movie will take some Oscars.Don't listen to the critics because their so wrong.
0783229321|5.0|This is one of the top comedy movies ever made.<BR>If, like me, you lived any similar kind of experience as that of Animal House, you will immediately feel the link back to those times. At my university back in the 60's and 70's, there was an Animal House (and that's exactly what it was commonly called) and it wasn't ours (but we were close!).<BR>The casting was perfectly done for this movie, the acting and script are well done and not only Belushi is great.<BR>If you're thin-skinned, you might find it offensive. <BR>Otherwise buy this movie on DVD- you'll love it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I loved this movie and I watched it over and over again.For those of you who are very emotional about what happened at Pearl Harbor;u gonna be mad,because the main characters didn't even exist and this was more of a drama movie about three people rather than a drama movie about Pearl Harbor.But this movie was something that both men and women are going to  like and the only reason the critics are messing with this movie is because it ain't 100 percent true.
0140288503|5.0|This is one of the best books (and reporting jobs) I have ever read.  I wish the author, Mark Bowden, was a reporter with my hometown newspaper.  I would then be sure I was getting clear, complete and unbiased reporting whenever I saw his byline.<br />As it is, I am thankful to have such an obscure battle and semi-war explained so well.  I finished the book with a good understanding of the situation in Somalia, how we wound up there and how the mission turned into a war.  More importantly, I now have a much deeper understanding and respect for our soldiers, especially Rangers and the Delta Force.  Of course, I always had a superficial understanding of how great they were and the sacrifices for which they volunteered, but now I have the evidence and emotional understanding to back it up.  I therefore recommend this book to every American.<br />Being an ignorant non-military type without the best memory in the world, I do have two very minor criticisms.  First, I think the book should have a glossary.  There are many abbreviations and other terms that are explained or defined once and then used throughout the rest of the book.  Unless you have a military background or an extraordinary memory, you will either find yourself flipping back through the book to try to find the meaning of different terms or, when you are in the middle of a gripping passage, simply trying to get the gist of the term from the rest of the passage.<br />Second, I wish the author had put a list of the main people in the book at the beginning or the end.  He does a pretty good job of adding a phrase to describe a person when he hasn't appeared for a while, like so and so, the Delta sergeant, or someone else, the leader of Chalk Two.  It probably would have been better to just give a brief description of each important soldier in one list so that the reader could refer to it whenever he or she wanted to do so.<br />Of course, both of these are minor quibbles.  The book was so interesting and well-written that these quibbles should not deter you from reading the book
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the best movie,I do not care what the ratings say.Josh Hartnett,Ben Affleck,Kate Beckinsale work great together.This was a touching movie.I cry every time I see this movie.I have seen it 15 times already.After seeing the movie I got posters and great stuff.
B000002UA9|4.0|Before they were to grow to the cultural icons we all know them as, they were kids just starting out.  Here it is, the Beatles first album.  This entire album was recorded in one very long session (something like 10-14 hours I think).  It was basically a collection of the best songs they did on their club gigs.  Note that of the 14 songs on here, only 8 are their own compositions, 6 are cover songs.  Even at this point however, there are hints that the writing team of Paul McCartney and John Lennon was going to be something special, but nothing to hint at just how revolutionary they were going to be.  At this point, they were just a very good rock and roll band.  Most of their songs here are just for fun (please please keep that in mind when you listen to this album).  Despite that their best was far in the future, I think it was during this point when they were having the most fun and exitement, and it shows on this record.<br />My picks for best songs on the album are (though none of them are bad):<br />I Saw Her Standing There - Spectacular, classic by even todays standards, great vocal performace by Paul<br />Boys - a good peformance by Ringo of this cover song<br />Please Please Me - One of their first hit singles<br />Love Me Do - An even bigger hit, though still nothing compared to later stuff<br />P.S. I Love You - probably not as good as the previous two, but still nice, Paul sings this one well.<br />Baby It's You - A good John Perfomace on this cover<br />Do You Want To Know A Secret -  A good George performance on this cover<br />Twist and Shout- Probably one of their most famous cover songs, John really lets rip on this one.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Absolutely one of the greatest accounts of the incident regarding Pearl Harbor.The DVD made you feel like you were there.Such truth in every scene.The actors were great and the love story was done with great heart.It was definately a movie worth owning and watching over and over again.
0385474547|5.0|The main character of this novel, Okonkwo, is a man who is haunted by the shame of his lazy and cowardly father. Even after earning fame and respect in all of the 9 villages of his homeland, he is still controlled by the fear of becoming weak like his father. This fear often causes him to be cruel to his family or to take strange and thoughtless actions. The story follows Okonkwo as he is faced with a series of troubles: caring for a boy from another village who is doomed by his own father's actions, watching his favorite daughter approaching death, and finally seeing the possibility of the destruction of all his beloved traditions when a group of Christian missionaries comes to the village. This novel introduces you to a culture that is so opposed to American culture that you will be amazed to find yourself appreciating their rituals and superstitions. By the end of the novel, I felt that I understood Okonkwo's way of life so well that I could see the Christian missionaries and their effect on the village from his point of view.
B00003CXTG|4.0|The Pearl Harbor DVD was very accurate during the attack phase,but for those of us familiar with the look of modern vessels versus those of WW2 vintage,if left a bit to be desired.The ships with &quot;explosions&quot; going on around them were high bowed,indicating a modern warship.The aircraft carrier coming into port was very obviously a modern carrier as indicated by the sheer size of the ship.All in all though it was a good story and interesting to watch.
0380002930|4.0|I picked up this book from the \\"give away\\" pile at home to read on a horrendously long plane ride and I found it so engrossing that I couldn't put it down. It is incredible how the story makes the characters human enough to create sympathy and interest in the reader and yet they remain true to their species, so they do not seem \\"humanized\\". The characters are dynamic, learning from each other and from their circumstances, gaining maturity and wisdom. There is a good balance between developing the plot and description (necessary for the reader to understand the dynamics of rabbit communities and to appreciate how rabbits view the world). I found the rabbit mythology, their own form of religion which reminded me of the greek myths, fascinating. These \\"myths\\" were very naturally woven into the plot, stories that rabbits told each other to amuse, inspire, distract.<br />I suppose the most unbelievable part of the book, is the fact that despite facing the most dire circumstances, none of the main characters die (only peripheral ones do). I was also disappointed that there were few, if any, memorable female characters (though the lack of females in the community drives the plot in the latter part of the book, so I suppose females are not entirely marginalized, but they are objectified).<br />One might think a book about rabbits as just \\"fluff\\" (no pun intended), but this story explores so many important themes: vision, loyalty, courage, faith, being true to oneself, acceptence of others/cooperation, etc. I think the animal element would appeal to children, yet the content of the book would be equally interesting for an adult.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is a very good movie about love and war.Sure the script was dry,but it's still a very good movie.The action scenes are amazing and emotional values is very high.The acting by the leads is all very good.Check it out.
B00005JKL8|4.0|This movie came and went at the movie theater and now it's coming to DVD.<br />The movie is nothing speacial but it's also nothing short of a good time with some good action sequences.  Owen Wilson plays a cocky, but always loveable, jet piolt who's never seen action and who's tired of it all.  Gene Hackman doesn't sweat at all playing his caption in charge.  One day Owen goes on a survey flight and treds of course and snaps a few pictures on a group of \\"people\\" getting rid of corpeses; the people shoot him down....and now he's behind enemy lines and on the run from the enemy.  All in all it's a good mindless fun popcorn guzzuling flick.<br />If this sounds like your bag then don't wait to buy it if your sceptical then rent it.<br />A great plus on the DVD is the DTS track and this DVD is a must if you want to showoff your sound system.  The track is great and shows off some impressive bass from the missle envaison part....if anything....this is the reason to own this DVD.
B00003CXTG|3.0|A fine cast acts the heck out of the tragi-romantic roles,and director Michael Bay handles the attack,which halfway through the three-hour film,with suspenseful aplomb.Still,he's the wrong man for this job.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Belive it folks, this is the best DVD, IMO, of 2001.  Everything from the Extras to the DTS track will blow you away.  It's very important to have good sound for a musical, and this is the best one.<br />As for the movie, it's a perrty simple love story...the only catch, is it's set in a early 20th century cabaret.  Ewan McGregor meets a traveling preformers and joins, they then sneek into the Moulin Rouge in attempt to get a job and it's there where he meets Nicole Kidman, the biggest talent at the Moulin Rouge.  They met and then the rest is pertty stright forward.<br />The great thing about this movie is it's first 40 min.  These first min. is full of crazy visuals and great music.....want to see a fat man in a red penguine suit sing Nervina's \\"Smells Like Teen Sprit\\" in the early 1900's?  Well, you get it here.  As a matter of fact you don't get on orgianl song, or oldie song, in this movie....and that's one of the most orgianl and innovative things I've ever ran across.<br />Not only are the songs great, but everything from the sets to the makeup to the costumes are all made with the smallest attition to detail....and trust me...this DVD presents it all good and well.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Absolutly the best war movie I have ever seen, and I have missed very few the past 25 years. Clearly indicates the spirit of the US Army Infantry AND the tremendous leadership skills and human elements of Col Hal Moore; who by the way retired a 3 star, or Lt General. <BR> I know a retired Airborne Ranger who lives here, that served with Col Moore on 2 out of 3 tours in Viet Nam. This professional and decorated soldier ,speaking of Col Moore  claims the movie doesen't even cover to the level deserved re his leadership, bravery under fire and just being a great human being. He was \\"Simply the Best\\". Col Moore is 80 now and I believe in pretty good shape. He consulted on this movie and people half his age struggled to keep up with his effort and energy, to insure an accurate and professtional movie was produced ,that told it like it was!!! <BR> This originally came out 4-5 years ago as a book \\"We were young once--and Soldiers\\" It is still available and I highly recommend it as great reading. \\"Airborne---All the Way\\"
B000002OZY|5.0|I remember when this record first came out- and how big an impact it had. Listening to it on this remaster I realize how well this was arranged and produced. In these pre-Korg days, Pete used simple piano and Hammond organ fills to 'orchestrate' his rock opera. Also notice how well he blends the acoustic with the electric guitar. Its all well done- sounds great. Sure it starts to sag when 'Sally Simpson' makes it appearance, but thats what the CD edit button is for. Set the program for the 12-14 best tracks..
0345451325|1.0|The game is was and always will be horrible. The weak story line in the game is shamefull and this sorry book was supposed to fill in all the tremendous gaps in the story. Unfortunatly it leaves much to be desired, Oh well chalk another bad move on Junk-rosoft's poor attempt to make a system and a game more popular than Resident Evil.
B0000029GA|5.0|If you want to hear hip-hop at its finest pick this up. Great beats and rhymes. Quite possibly the greatest hip-hop album ever made. Just pure hip-hop. No bling bling or talking about women and money. Just street poetry at its best.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It's pretty clear this album's caused a lot of pretty polarized opinions. The Strokes obviously have some heavy punk influences--very simple guitar chord sets, lots of energy overall, and repetitiveness in the front melody and vocals. But the hardcore punk crowd is obviously disappointed; John Casablancas, the Strokes' lead singer, is no Iggy Pop, no Lou Reed, no Joey Ramone. (I don't care what Rough Guides says.) But, the Strokes are not trying to be like the Stooges, Velvet Underground or the Ramones. With these great bands, the energy, rasp, and fury of the lead singer were front and center. However, Casablancas' voice is all fuzzed out, and his bandmates overpower him frequently. (Though he really belts out \\"Take It or Leave It\\".)<br />On the other hand, the harmony between all those guitars and the vocals is really impressive. Someone before me mentioned that listening to Casablancas is like trying to decipher Michael Stipe's mumblings from old R.E.M.--who cares what the words are? (Since Michael Stipe is the anti-Iggy, true punk devotees may not follow the R.E.M. comparison.) I think of the vocals in \\"Is This It?\\" as just another instrument in the band, and a pretty well played one. The hooks in the album are hidden harmonies, and you'll like them long before you disassemble them.<br />So, okay, where does that leave us? \\"Is This It?\\" is a high-energy effort from a harmony-based band. If you like rock, don't listen to much punk (maybe you thought Public Image Limited was finally the Johnny Rotten you could listen to), you'll like this album. If you like to focus on the personality or the aura of the singer, or, if you really want to know what those lyrics are about, forget the Strokes. (No liner notes in this one, sorry.) I'm a sucker for harmony, so I love it.
2253005274|5.0|One winter during the 1890s, the teenage adventurer Augustin Meaulnes hijacks a carriage and disappears for several days.  What mysterious realm did he discover while gone?  Who was the beautiful girl he encountered there?  Meulnes pursues the answers to these questions over the following years, like a madman at times, single-mindedly obsessed.  His loyal school friend, Francois, lives out the adventure voyeuristically by assisting Meulnes in whatever way he can.  And that, to me, is the core of this brilliant novel - not the romantic drama or the solution of a mystery, but the nature of friendship.  Francois exists solely to observe and record Meulnes' enormous charisma, his wild and passionate spirit.  He lives off the scraps of life that Meulnes leaves him, devotedly and selflessly tending the consequences of his friend's impetuous character.  For Meaulnes, there will always be one more adventure after the burst of adolescent love has been resolved, but what about Francois, whose whole life has depended on it?  That, in my opinion, is what makes Alain-Fournier's book so poignant and so haunting.
B00005R1N3|4.0|I've been watching horror flicks since I could form whole sentences, so nothing really surprises me anymore. Where others are cowering behind couches and covering their eyes, I'm like, \\"Please, that isn't even remotely scary.\\" Well, if I were to show \\"Black Christmas\\" to those fools, they'd probably die outright of fright.  I finally saw it last year, and let me tell you, that was the first time in my life I actually looked into the closet to make sure no one was hiding behind the door. <br />The plot in a nutshell goes like this: a sorority house is emptying as Christmas break approaches.  A few sisters are staying a few extra days.  Little do they know, someone has climbed into the attic (someone clearly warped and insane), and begins to pick them off one by one.  Oh, and he makes threatening phone class (scary as heck) to them before he kills them.  Not until there's only one girl left are the calls traced to the room upstairs.  If you're thinking this is all pretty standard so far, remember this: BLACK CHRISTMAS was made a full four years before HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS.  While HALLOWEEN is probably the more exciting of the two, BLACK CHRISTMAS is the scarier one, and pretty much set the stage and the standard for the all the clones that would follow.  It's chills and frights are not based on BOO! moments but escalating dread and and oppressive atmosphere.  The cast does pretty well:  Olivia Hussey as the kind but tough heroine, Margot Kidder as the foulmouthed alcoholic in the house, Andrea Martin as the wry but vulnerable sister. And you just don't find endings like this one in recent slasher pics.  SCREAM, while entertaining, is not about true fear. BLACK CHRISTMAS is.<br />Bottom line: This movie isn't perfect, but it comes close. It knows exactly how to scare: by focusing on what we don't see, by imagining what is happening just beyond our line of sight.  And that's a hundred times scarier than a lame killer in a ghostface mask and a cell phone who trips every time he chases someone.  There's no \\"cutesy\\" horror in BLACK CHRISTMAS.  See SCREAM/URBAN LEGEND/I KNOW WHAT YOU DID/etc. for that vapid stuff.
B0000634EV|5.0|Then you are in for a treat here. All the same trademarks that made the first Down CD back in '95 an instant classic (soulful lyrics, heavy as nails riffing, and thought-provoking melodies) are here, and then some. Phil's vocal performance is outstanding, and Pepper and Kirk's guitar assault is so sludgy its' amazing. <br />It would be a complete shame if this album does not go gold or platinum, and wipe out all the trendy nu-metal garbage that is polluting the scene right now.<br />I am just hoping that this doesn't mean the end of Pantera. But if this succeeds commercially, one would have to reckon Down will tour their [bottoms] off this time.<br />If you are fan of true, honest rock music and/or any of the bands these guys hail from (Pantera, COC, Crowbar, and Eyehategod), then this should be considered required listening.
B00005UKE0|4.0|I expected more from this album, but after reading the first page of the liner notes (written by Harrison) I was put to ease: he was obviously distressed at the dated style of Phil Spector's production. I'm new to George Harrison's solo work, so I came into it with no preconceptions (other than knowing My Sweet Lord). Many songs, including the aforementioned hit, What A Pity, I Live For You, Behind that Locked Door, Beware of Darknes, the title track, and If Not For you are very good to excellent. Some others are good, and a few are almost unbearable...case in point: Wah-Wah - despite a promising opening, the song progresses into a near cacophony of noise, where George's voice is unpleasently overwpowered by the sound; some may enjoy it, but I think it's dreadful. Simply put, the songs -the lyrics and basic music itself- are all pretty good. Again, however, some are, unfortunately, over-produced and slightly schmaltzy by virtue of that production, another instance of which being I'd Have You Anytime. <br />As for the extra tracks, I'm not a fan of 70s style, longwinded repetitive jam sessions, so they're not particularly enjoyable for me. Contrary to many reviewers, however, I find My Sweet Lord 2000 preferable to the original. The new one is stripped down and has a more mystical, folksy feel to it. The sitar on MSL 2000 is much more pronounced, and the bridge is more poignant in its musical clarity. As for his voice, perhaps it is a bit weaker than it was 30 years ago (he doesn't hum in the 2000 version). The new background vocals are okay, but they give it a slightly more or a commerical, pop flavor, for which I don't particularly care.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd has taken the best part o themselves, and put it into The Wall. Really, what more needs to be said? The whole two disc set delves into the rise of a rock star through the ranks, and to superstardom. If you like rock and roll, and u like the tracks u hear from this disc on th radio, BUY IT. The radio cant do justice to The Wall. When u do get it, dont sit there and choose tracks that u know, listen to both discs in order. We all know the hits from that disc, Another Brick in the Wall pt2, Comfortably Numb, just small bricks in the wall when you hear the whole disc you'll know what I mean.
B00005LQ04|5.0|I first saw the now OOP laserdisc copy almost 12 years ago, and never forgot this film.  When I saw this Limited Edition, I just new it had to go in my collection.<br />Like the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" Anchor Bay DVD, \\"Suspiria LTD Ed.\\"  almost makes you forget you're watching a film made over 20 years ago.  Crystal clear picture, excellent sound and vibrant colors all make this a real treat. Sure, the price is much more steep than the regular DVD release, but it's well worth it.<br />Most everything the average viewer would want to know about this film is included in this package, including an extensive disertation plus Jessica Harper interview found in the enclosed booklet.  And speaking of Jessica Harper, though she's obviously aged quite a bit since the film was made still has that little girl innocence and cute too-big head in the recent on-camera interview.<br />The Goblin \\"Daemonia\\" video is delightfully cheesy, but it appears the lead member Claudio Simonetti is the ONLY original member of the group in the video (the drummer in particular looks a little too young to be an orginal member of a band that's had roughly a three-decade history); I may be wrong on this.<br />An overall 5-star rating goes to this disc; perhaps some behind-the-scenes footage captured during the prodution would've been nice, but I can't complain with what's presented here...<br />..except for one thing: there's a rumor running around that the first murder scene is not fully uncut.  It's reported that some frames of the close-up pan down the front of the hanging girl's body are missing (notice how the cut starts at her legs and works down), though I know of no other version of \\"Supiria\\" where this is different...
B0000634EV|5.0|On Down ll A bustle in your hedgerow, the band went further with their true southern sound and Phil has never sounded like he does on this album. His voice reaches new limits and reches out to your soul like never before.<BR> Recorded in 28 days, this album is a true classic. The idea behind DOWN has always been to just do it quick in a basement or someone's garage. Songs like \\"Stained Glass Cross\\" will make you feel like youre back in time when music was good and songs meant something. Listening to calm southern songs like \\"Learn From This Mistake\\" and \\"Where I'm Going\\" will take you out of your worl and bring you deep into your mind, putting you on a front porch of a Louisiana home on a hot summer night. The CD has songs that'll change your life forever. This ain't no ... money grabbing poser band, this is a band that will be a legend remembered long time from now in the hearts of all the people it moved. This is an album that will become the soundtrack of many lives.
0802136834|5.0|Alison Weir did a wonderful job writing this!  You know how most reference  books are dull reading and you have to drag yourself through them? This is the complete opposite!  I admire Alison Weir for writing this because she doesn't sugar-coat anything.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Every time you think you have this movie figured out, WHAM, something happens that blows away your conjecture.  I pity the reviewer who stopped after the first hour.  Like many classic movies the first half of the movie does a great job of setting up the last half - which he missed.  Once you get past the set up, one revelation follows another and leave you gasping as you begin to understand the events that led up to the things you've already seen.  Seldom are those events what you anticipated.  One of the most enthralling movies I've seen in recent memory.  Wait, what movie am I talking about...?
B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes certainly do bring back memories of late 70's rock/punk.  The riffs are catchy and melodic.  The songs are very simliar to one another.  Almost too similar as they flow into one another...it's like you've heard one long song after listening to the album.  Last Nite is a good song with an equally good 70's-esque video.<br />If you want to listen to something better - but somewhat akin to the Strokes - check out Marquee Moon by Television.
B00005R2M3|5.0|if you like shakira get this cd.  I ccan't get enough of the good music she makes.  I rated this cd 5 stars for many good reasons.  I like all her songs, even the spanish ones.  And i don't know a word of spanish.
B00005JKED|4.0|Training Day is a very captivating flick.  Denzel does a great job of playing the hardened cop with a very dark and evil side.  Ethan Hawke plays off him well as the innocent rookie - the young and hopeful.<br />Some of these scenes were just gripping in their intensity.  The drama mixed with extreme violence will leve you breathless at times.<br />One thing I question:  I'm not so sure the line between lead and supporting actor is clear in the film.  Denxel is the \\"lead,\\" but I honestly think Ethan Hawke could have been considered the lead actor.  Just my opinion though.
0440213525|5.0|John Grisham does what he is the best at, which is writing. He mixes his extremely well put together plots with his law skills to create masterpieces read and re-read by millions. In my opinion, this book is definately worth buying.<BR>It's basically about an 11 year old boy who has a cigarette with his brother in the woods when they stumble upon a car. Inside this car is the lawyer defending Barry \\"The Blade\\" Muldanno, and for some reason, this man inside the car wants to kill himself. Since Mark and his little brother Ricky was there, they fall into the situation which turns into a matter for the best lawyers in the U.S. who try their best to squeeze what really happened out of Mark and Ricky. I give this book 5 stars because it is astounding, the plot, the style of writing, the characters, all the best ever. There was even a movie made about it.

B0000048V8|5.0|Believe in magic. <br />I was a young lad when I first saw &quot;the Snowman.&quot; Watching cartoons like &quot;Silverhawks&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Orbots&quot; had left me jaded, cynical, and violence-prone. Following that course would have ended me up in heaps of trouble--I might've even been wanted by the C.I.A.!<br />Fate intervened on a cold, wintry day in fourth grade, when our wonderful teacher treated us to an in-class video. Little hooligan that I was, I scoffed when the title &quot;the Snowman&quot; appeared. Before long, however, I was swept into a world of beauty, love, and swirling snow. I was transfixed by the image of the Snowman and the little boy soaring o'er the countryside, able to leave all their cares below.<br />From that day, I've spread joy, peace and love to others. It amazes me that I was once so foolish and cruel. A simple, lovely cartoon changed all that.<br />Believe in magic.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby's Play is truly an essential album. The tracks vary from upbeat, techno and dance beats, to slow, ambient and relaxing melodies. You'll recognize some of the tunes from car commercials, television and films, such as The X-Files. The strong combination and variety of these songs balances out the theme of this album. Moby has combined very definitive elements and rhythms into his music, that can capture almost anyone's attention. Good for dances, parties, or relaxing at home with a good novel.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Last night brought the news of Billy Wilder's death. According to his NY Times obituary, Wilder spent the last 20 years of his life begging for the money to make another movie: they gave him all the achievement awards you could think of, but no opportunity for another film.<br />When you watch \\"The Apartment\\", you'll see why. It's funny, sad, acid, sophisticated, thoughtful, witty, with acting that you'll never forget: a truly grown-up movie, the kind of movie that leaves the viewer a little wiser than he was before he watched it. Hollywood doesn't make that kind of movie any more.<br />Buy it. Watch it. You'll laugh and cry - and you'll wonder just what happened to the movie business, that theaters are filled with rubbish like \\"Blade II\\" while Billy Wilder begged for work.
B000063CPL|5.0|There are two things that always came to my mind every time I heard that Iron Maiden was releasing a new live album, the first is that I always thought that the legendary \\"Live after Death\\" will never be superated and the second one is a certain fear <BR>everytime I felt when I saw Steve Harris on the production credits, lets face it the real live and death ones were not the best live work of the Irons. If we consider that Mr Harris is on the credits of \\"Rock In Rio\\" again and that the clips that <BR>you can hear from this album in the ironmaiden.com are of a horrible quality you can think... oh my God Not again!!! So I went to the store with not convinced at all if getting the cd was a very good idea but as soon as I saw it on the rack the magic of the Irons caught me inmediately. For me the \\"Brave New World\\" is the best contemporary work of heavy metal ever made and now I can tell you for sure that \\"Rock in Rio\\" is <BR>the first best contemporary live album of heavy metal ever made in this century.<BR>The production is awesome considering that now we have three guitars on it.<BR>Mr Harris bass as always present, Nicko's drum kit is very clear since the opening and Bruce's performance is incredible, he does more than just sing, he shows the best of all the experience gained for years in how to drive and motivate the crowd to let it go. Since the opening you really experience how an Iron Maiden<BR>concert is, you really feel like if you are part of the crowd, everything is just perfect, the crowd in extasis when the Intro goes on and the first riff from Adrian's guitar leading to the Wicker Man and everybody screaming toghether \\"Your<BR>time will come\\" as well as \\"We are blood brothers\\".<BR>The booklet is great with the reprints of the lyrics an concert pictures. At the back of it there is the classic concert picture of the Irons with all the crowd behind them and in the last page you'll be able to find a cool new version of Eddie in the Brasilian flag. The only thing that is missing is a good picture of the all the band performing on the stage.<BR>Get it now. It's awesome.
B0000041DF|5.0|Let me tell you that I was totally shocked when hearing this piece, the last movement in particular. It is an unhuman performance. The most unbelievable part is that it is a live recording. I have several different versions of Rach 3rd. This is definitely the fastest one I've ever had. This supreme speed brings about the extreme passion. I was wondering when I first listened to this CD: how could Argerich play in such a sonic speed while she could still fully express the sentiment that this concerto should deliver? But I heard that Rachmaninoff himself had version, which was faster than this one. I don't have this version.<br />If you call this Rach 3rd is the ultimate one, I dare say that the Tchaikovsky 1st is the worst.......be honest.. She played, in my opinion, too many wrong notes. Especially in the third movement, at the very beginning, she made several mistakes.
B00000G3AZ|1.0|I hate this adaptation.Paltrow is drippy,insipid and just isnt Emma.O.K,so im not a great fan of the book but i love Pride and Prejudice(book and film)and thought i would give this a go.I can see im kind of in the minority here as everyone seems to love it but the sad truth is in my opinion it is boring ,badly acted and i hate Paltrow.The co stars are at best passable and most of them are not even that.When a film is taken from a book  it needs to have 3 main ingreds:It needs to be 1: faithful to the book  2:interesting and lively and  3:well acted.This adaptation has none of these.So basically dont buy it.If you do be prepared for v.bad acting
0767817478|2.0|Heavily publicized as the event film of the year, \\"Godzilla\\" was expected to thunder into theaters in May 1998. It arrived with more of a thud. While it did not lose money, it was no monster hit. The finished product failed to met the high expectations of the audience. <br />In 1994 a movie was released which was directed by Roland Emmerich and produced by his brother Ute and by Dean Devlin. It was called \\"Stargate\\". This sleek, high tech science fantasy became a surprise worldwide hit. Devlin and the Emmerich brothers parlayed that success into getting financial backing for \\"Independence Day\\". This second success made a fortune for them and for 20th Century-Fox. <br />These first two hits may have stretched the imagination of the group too far, since their third joint effort was this $125 million dollar remake of \\"Godzilla\\", cheap but effective Japanese film, which was a metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war. <br />Sometimes, there is a certain charm to the Emmerichs and Devlin's efforts. They seem full of boyish naiveté and energy. They employ an army of special effects wizards who happily use all their cameras and digital equipment like brilliant abstract painters gone mad. <br />Unfortunately, all these visual and audio tricks never overcome weak plots that seem to have been written on the backs of cocktail napkins. As the sensory elements increase in each successive film, the story line gets increasingly lifeless. In \\"Godzilla\\", a gigantic reptile that is the result of nuclear weapons testing, decides Manhattan is the perfect island on which to hatch a couple of hundred little monsters. Godzilla must be stopped before it is destroys the world's most expensive piece of real estate in the name of Motherhood. <br />The plot is so poorly conceived that no one can decide what sex Godzilla is. While it's revealed early on that the beast is pregnant, it is constantly referred to as 'he' in every scene in which it wreaks havoc. Later it is referred to as asexual. Towards the end we are told that its offspring are born already pregnant themselves. Is this pseudo science, or is it a comment on the sexual confusion of our times? I think the answer is that it's bad writing.<br />There are some very good performers, such Matthew Broderick, in the movie. They prove that, when the pay is good, even seasoned professionals can be enticed to be bad actors. Perhaps the cast budget should have been trimmed, so that more money could have been spent on settling the issue of Godzilla's gender. <br />My favorite scene takes place in the remains of Madison Square Garden, which Godzilla has trashed while laying his or her eggs. Huge chunks of concrete and twisted metal are everywhere. The famous scoreboard has fallen to the floor. So that we might see all the giant eggs, one of the characters throws a switch on this tiny electric junction box. Every light in the building comes on. Not a bulb has been broken, Not a single wire has been cut. Ah! The miracle of movie magic!<br />The scene just described is typical of \\"Godzilla\\" and other films that are too reliant on arsenals of digital special effects. Visual and audio overkill numbs the senses. The makers seem to burn out as well. They create an environment which causes them to become obsessed with manipulation. Scenes contradict other scenes. Since the special effects are added on later, actors have too many invisible events going on around them. As a result, when performers are supposed to look amazed or terrified, they appear to be dazed and confused. Instead of feeling empathy, the audience is nearer to laughter.
B000002513|5.0|Still the best album Springsteen's done, and, yes, I do believe that he's recorded many good albums, but this is the greatest; none surpass it.  Bruce definitely honed and mastered his skills in the studio well after this album was done, but these songs depict the young, wide-eyed, and innocent Bruce that was lost after his bitter legal feud with Mike Appel in the late '70s.<br />It is very obvious that Bruce was listening a lot to Van Morrison's Astral Weeks and the Velvet Underground's Loaded prior to writing and recording this collection of songs because this is a solid combination of both albums.  Play VU's Sweet Jane before you plug in Incident On 57th Street and you'll see what I'm talking about.  And, if you have 25 minutes to spare, compare Van's Madame George with Bruce's version, New York City Serenade.  I'm not saying Bruce copied, but he sure drew his influences from quality material.<br />All in all, an excellent album that you'll appreciate more and more with every listen.  This was a unique part of Bruce's career that he only really revisted once, when he recorded Jungleland for the Born to Run album.  <br />Enjoy.
0767819659|4.0|Madeline is a slight but utterly charming film taken from the children's books by Ludwig Bemelmas. It does not possess the dramatic content of The Secret Garden or A Little Princess, but it's free of the cynicism of the modern five-year old, as in The Rugrats Movie. It has an innocence which is downright old-fashioned. I liked it, and I am cynical and somewhat over the age of five.<br />Aren't the best stories about little girls often about orphans? That's what bright, adorable eight-year old Madeline is, as are her eleven schoolmates in a small private school in Paris. Usually the students dress alike, but they have several outfits. There are some wonderfully colorful scenes of the young ladies exploring the City of Lights. All have distinct personalities, which causes them to disagree on many subjects. This makes for some charming bits of dialog.<br />In charge of this group is the wise and tolerant nun, Miss Clavell, and the cold, lonely Lord Covington, whom the girls refer to by such names as Lord Coo Coo Face. These two characters are played by an American treasure, Francis McDormand, and a British one, Nigel Hawthorne. McDormand won an Oscar for Best Actress in Fargo, while Hawthorne was nominated for Best Actor in The Madness of King George. This picture is more of a holiday than an acting job for these major talents, but it's always nice to see them. <br />Madeline is spirited and exuberant. She gets into one mess after another. She winds up in the hospital, falls into the River Seine, nearly destroys the Spanish Embassy, smuggles a dog into the school and finds herself accidentally kidnapped by circus clowns. As directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer and portrayed by the delightful Hatty Jones, Madeline is never seen as a bad girl. She's simply a very bright and curious one.<br />The plot may be old hat and predictable, but the film is handled in such a light and lyrical style that I doubt many children will care. It's so professionally done that most adultscaught having to sit through it should find it a pleasant hour and a half. Filmed on location in Paris, it is indeed lovely to look at. <br />Madeline got overlooked at the boxoffice in a very crowded 1998. Besides the already mentioned Rugrats, we were treated to three other animated film events - Antz, A Bug's Life and The Prince of Egypt. Hopefully, the less ambitious Madeline will find the audience it deserves on DVD.<br />Rated PG for a reason called &quot;momentary language&quot;. If anyone knows what this phrase means, please let me know.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Spielberg and Kubrick seem the unlikeliest of bedfellows, so it's all the more remarkable that their lovechild should be such a pleasing one.<br />Perhaps Spielberg took his inspiration from his own Jurassic Park, where extinct animals were resurrected from found DNA crossed with frog's? Here, two years after his death, we have a new Stanley Kubrick film, assembled from 15 years worth of development material crossed with Spielberg's own take on the story.<br />As an exercise, it is incredible. Although he never shot a frame of it, A.I. feels like no one's work so much as Kubrick's... well, except perhaps Steven Spielberg's. It's a bizarre hybrid; structured like Kubrick, looking like Kubrick but with the showmanship and doe-eyed sentiment of the other guy.<br />Of course, it doesn't always work. For all his insight into Kubrick's vision, Spielberg occasionally seems to be following the recipe. You just know that Kubrick would have made the `Flesh Fair' sequence central, made it something unforgettably nasty, tattooed it on to our brains. Spielberg doesn't seem to know what to do with it, and squanders it showing off what the boys from ILM can do with computers these days. Consequently, it's where the film sags.<br />But, my God, does he make up for it. See A.I. and try to forget the submerged Manhattan, the ferris wheel collapsing underwater, the approach to the frozen future-Earth, the performance of Haley Joel Osment, the sense of quiet despair that humanity is getting it wrong and will ultimately get it wrong.<br />It's impossible to look at the Manhattan section without referencing the atrocities of September 11, and while everyone involved with A.I. may have felt uncomfortable about the year of release, the bad timing actually helps the film. We now live in a world where it's much easier to imagine the human race bringing about its own extinction. A.I. foretells it beautifully.
B00000G3PA|4.0|I surprised myself by liking this film on the whole. It does have some weak points, which I am only too happy to point out, but this is not only the most spectacular film since &quot;Titanic&quot;, it is also an example of how digital special effects can succeed in the hands of a top notch professional crew. <br />Before I surprise myself too much, let me point out that &quot;Armageddon&quot; is scientifically sophomoric. Time and again, the story defies the laws of physics. <br />As in &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, we are expected to believe that an object in outer space the size of Texas could get to within a few days of Earth before we detected it. This is especially silly in &quot;Armageddon&quot; because the killer asteroid is depicted as a very bright one. Any child could spot it without binoculars.<br />This time the United States government turns to a bunch of lovable roughnecks, whose occupation is drilling for oil. I suppose the capitalist in us can buy the idea that the planet would be saved from a natural catastrophe by people who spend their days plundering it. In the last several years, America has been increasingly portrayed in movies as the unofficial ruler of the world. Other nations are cast as either obedient or unruly children. When disaster strikes, we call all the shots. I have no political stance on this point of view, but it seems to me that, if this is the best team we can find to save the world, the kids are in a heap of trouble. <br />What puts &quot;Armageddon&quot; head and shoulders above its competition is that its makers created an escapist entertainment with wild abandon. I don't think they expected it to be anything more than a comic book emotionally. The emphasis is not on intellect, it is on craftsmanship. First they created state of the art special effects. Then, instead of dwelling on their accomplishments, they edited these scenes into numerous very fast cuts. They were so confident that some scenesare shaky and out of focus. The result is a feeling of being on a thrill ride. <br />There are four great actors in &quot;Armageddon&quot; - Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Taylor and Ben Affleck. They have a large presence in the film and are allowed to ham it up as much as they want to. This works. On the surface, they give their usual great performance. Underneath, they convey to us that this movie has nothing to do with the end of the world and everything to do with entertainment. <br />It is getting tiresome, by the way, to find so many people connecting pictures like &quot;Armageddon&quot; with the Millennium Doomsday Machine. In truth, this flick is a direct descendant of the Granddaddy of all disaster films. This was a 1961 film called &quot;The Last Voyage&quot;. It set the tone for all future works on the subject. The current crop of end of the world movies actually reverse themselves. Mankind is now seen as able to avert anything that comes its way. We were annihilated way back in 1959 in the excellent &quot;On the Beach&quot;. In 1983 we became extinct twice, first in &quot;The Day After&quot; and then in &quot;Testament&quot;. The last time we faded into the sunset was in &quot;The Rapture&quot; in 1991. <br />&quot;Armageddon&quot; is about as good as its type of movie gets. There is no need to put your thinking cap on or to analyze anything. Just enjoy the ride. If you have a home theater system, the audio is amazing.
B000002KXV|5.0|I was a late bloomer when it came to succumbing to the charms of Steely Dan. Oh, there were a few songs I liked, but I always viewed them as an essentially top 40 band. It was their masterpiece Aja that finally got me to appreciate the sheer genius of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen.<BR>Then came Fagen's solo effort Nightfly. I can think of few other albums that I could listen to daily without tiring of them. Every song is masterfully arranged. The album is upbeat, suave, romantic and an impeccable blend of jazz and rock.<BR>The narrator of this magnificent theme album is flush with optimism throughout for both his own possibilities and for the possibilities of society at large, fueled by the efflorescence of the technological age.<BR>The only hitch in his utopian panorama is the obvious reference to the communist takeover of Cuba in The Goodbye Look.<BR>My favorites are the forward-looking IGY, the wistful Maxine, the hopeful New Frontier, and the tropical feel of both The Goodbye Look and Walk Between the Raindrops.<BR>Special mention should be given to the title track. How many of us actually wish there were stations like WJAZ? I would think that all lovers of non-commercial music yearn for such a station. Only a few of us are lucky to live in a place where a good independent station plays non-commercial jazz.<BR>Donald Fagen has earned his wings with The Nightfly. Not only is he a masterful lyricist, but he is a virtuoso musician.<BR>I own thousands of CDs, tapes, and LPs and if I were allowed to bring only ten to a desert island exile, Nightfly might well be one of them.
6305165912|5.0|The Coens brothers are not that prolific. I'd estimate that the combined income from all their projects is less than 10% of what \\"Titanic\\" made. <br />Nonetheless, one of their productions, \\"Fargo\\", made the AFI's Top 100 list. What's more impressive is that voters on the far more democratic Internet Movie DataBase put 4 of their 7 films on the site's Top 250 list. <br />\\"The Big Lebowski\\" is one of those four movies. It has the definitive Coen signature, which can be described as the ability to show how ordinary people accidentally find themselves in extraordinary situations. These are usually criminal in nature. <br />In \\"Blood Simple\\", there was a dead body that wouldn't stay buried. Unable to have children of their own, a couple - a cop and an ex-con - found a solution when a rich couple had sextuplets in \\"Raising Arizona\\". They figured that, if they kidnapped one of the infants, no one would miss it. Frances McDormand, who is Mrs. Joel Coen in real life, stole the show in \\"Fargo\\". She played a Minnesota policewoman investigating one of the dumbest crimes ever committed. <br />\\"The Big Lebowski\\" is an enormously funny story about mistaken identity, a kidnapping and a missing rug. <br />Jeff Bridges, who's had a very up and down career, gives his best performance since 1993's \\"Fearless\\", a highly recommended film. <br />Bridges' character refuses to answer to his last name, Lebowski. Irrevocably stuck in the 70's, he insists on being called The Dude. About the only things he does well are bowling and smoking illegal substances. <br />His best friend, Walter, is trapped in an even worse time frame. He thinks he's still in Vietnam. As Walter, John Goodman gives what is arguably his best screen performance. <br />The real fun begins when Russian thugs burst into The Dude's apartment. Taking a bath in a candle lit bathroom and listening to groovy 70's tunes, our stoned hero doesn't get really mad until the intruders ruin his favorite rug. <br />These villains demandthat The Dude's wife repay a lot of money she owes. This presents a problem because The Dude isn't married. Said wife, aptly named Bunny, is married to someone else - The Big Lebowski [David Huddleson], a creepy old man whose daughter Maude is older than Bunny. <br />Maude also becomes a problem. She has her own thugs, despises her father and is convinced Bunny kidnapped herself. As Maude, Julieanne Moore is even better than she was in \\"Boogie Nights\\". She also gets to make one of the most memorable entrances in the history of motion pictures. <br />By now you are perhaps thinking that this movie is wacky. If so, you are not only right, but that's just the beginning of the picture. <br />The brothers Coen are relentless inventive and outrageous. In \\"The Big Lebowski\\", they even find a way to scold themselves for the profanity that is rampant throughout the movie. Even the foul language seems more satirical than prurient. <br />Joel and Ethan seem to live happily in their own dimension. Personally, I enjoy their distorted view of reality. Or is it really distorted? You decide.
B000063CPL|4.0|This is a really good live album and is much better than A Real Live/Dead One but not as good as their masterpiece Live After Death. I haven't heard Live At Donnington so I won't compare to that. First off, these are the things I don't like about this album:<BR>1.) The song selection:All of the songs from Fear of the Dark back have already been on previous live recordings, many of them 4 times!<BR>2.) Steve Harris copied Bruce's vocals over some of the crowd singing(these were live vocals from the concert that were repetitive so it wasn't studio vocals being recorded over live vocals). This is a small complaint but I like my live albums left alone except for mixing.<br />Okay, here is what you get:<BR>1.) Wicker Man<BR>2.) Ghost of the Navigator<BR>3.) Brave New World<BR>These first 3 songs are all from the new album and are pulled off pretty well.<BR>4.) Wrathchild<BR>5.) Two Minutes to Midnight<BR>These songs are pulled off pretty well but they were pulled off well on previous live albums so why are they here again?<BR>6.) Blood Brothers<BR>One of the best songs on the new album and the audience participation on this song is awesome.<BR>7.) Sign of the Cross<BR>The best of the Blaze Bayley era however Blaze butchered it as usual with his horrible out of key singing. Now it is heard here as it should have been with Bruce singing it. This song along with The Clansman is the main reason I bought this CD.<BR>8.) The Mercenary<BR>Another from the new album but the weakest. The closest to filler you'll get on this album and it isn't bad.<BR>9.) The Trooper<BR>This Maiden classic has already been recorded live before and this version sounds like [junk] so I don't know why they included it. The three guitars make the dual lead that makes this song so great end up making it sound like mud. I don't know why they decided to keep Janick Gers in the first place. It's just a wasted salary but that's another story.<BR>10.) Dream of Mirrors<BR>Great song from the new album and pulled off really well here.<BR>11.) The Clansman<BR>See my comments on Sign of the Cross. <BR>12.) The Evil That Men Do<BR>13.) Fear of the Dark<BR>These were both recorded previously but the Evil That Men Do sounds better here.<BR>14.) Iron Maiden<BR>This has been recorded several times but it will always be in Iron Maiden concerts so a live album wouldn't be complete without it.<BR>15.) The Number of the Beast<BR>16.) Hallowed be thy Name<BR>Two Maiden classics but again, why do we need another live version?<BR>17.)

6305232660|4.0|In 1998, as has often happened in years past, two movie studios competed directly by producing films with identical themes. This year the subject was huge asteroids on a collision course with Earth. Paramount was feverishly working on \\"Deep Impact,\\" while Disney was toiling away on \\"Armageddon.\\" <br />Luckily, Paramount had two things in its favor with \\"Deep Impact\\". It had a film that cost half as much as Disney's giant, and it got the movie into theaters several weeks sooner. As a result, it also proved to be major succes. <br />In some ways, \\"Deep Impact\\" proved once again that smaller can be better. While its director, Mimi Leder, has been working for eleven years, the first nine of these were strictly in television. She has won two Emmys for her efforts on \\"ER\\". Since the picture did not have the astronomical budget of its competitor, her training at character portrayal and at manipulation of our emotions makes it the better of the two. <br />Although the FX are unspectacular by current standards, Paramount and Leder remembered that audience identification with characters can have enormous pull. So many people, for example, are still mesmerized by the first \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, but in thinking about them, we always remember Luke Skywalker, Hans Solo and the Princess, as well as the visuals. For that matter, had it not been for the story of Jack and Rose, it's probable that \\"Titanic\\" would have sank almost as fast as the ship itself. <br />As an \\"ER\\" veteran, Leder certainly knows which heart strings to pull. It certainly helped that she had a battery of veteran performers in the cast. Robert Duvall is especially compelling as an aging astronaut, who is sent into space with a bunch of youngsters to attempt to blow the asteroid into harmless fragments. Morgan Freeman walks through his role as President of the United States, but he walks nicely. Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell shine as the divorced parents of Jenny, a TV reporter, who is quite well portrayed by Tea Leoni. Elijah Wood shows his usual intensity in his role as a stereotypical teenage genius. Since the seventeen year old Wood is now working on his 18th film, I imagine he qualifies as a veteran. <br />Through its emphasis on emotional issues, \\"Deep Impact\\" overcomes a plot which is both full of holes and seriously flawed scientifically. In defense of the screen writers, I'll add that any attempt to make a two hour movie which depicts the possible annihilation of life as we know it is doomed to come off as trite. The only possible s exceptions I can think of are \\"On the Beach\\", made way back in 1959, and \\"The Day After\\", made, ironically, for TV.<br />There are two aspects of \\"Deep Impact\\" that perplexed me. James Horner's musical score is his most uninspired in ages. The main reason I bring this up is that the music is the one component that can equal the film's theme. Since the soundtrack is one of the last things done in making a movie, I imagine he might have already been dazed and confused by his \\"Titanic\\" success when he tackled this project's even grimmer subject.<br />The other complaint is over the final scene in the picture. I have a gut feeling the director would agree with me because it is counter to the mood she strove to achieve in the rest of it. This could have happened simply because she has not worked on the big screen long enough to have any control over the final cut.
B0000634EV|5.0|When Nola first came out I must say I absolutely loved the album.  It wasn't what i expected from Phil Anselmo, Pepper and the Crowbar boys.  But it was still really heavy, and I loved their collaborative Heavy Metal Blues sound.  So I have to warn you not to expect what you heard on Nola.  The songs are not as heavy, but every bit as good if not better.  The first time I listened to it I was disappointed, but after going through a second time and putting my expectations aside I found the sound to be &quot;cleaner&quot; than before.  I guess 7 years polishes a band nicely.  &quot;Landing on the Mountains of Meggido&quot; was the pefect cap to the album.  My fiance actually called the song &quot;beautiful&quot;, if i was in college still I would crash on the couch with a joint and play the whole album through, its &quot;that&quot; kind of album.   Dare I say it has a definate &quot;classic southern rock&quot; sound to it.  A perfect mix of heavy &quot;crunch crunch&quot; powercords and bluesy slide guitar. Phils voice is perfect for the music, and the lyrics are great. there are a lot more of the effects added to the songs than you heard in Nola.  Bla bla bla, if you liked them before you'll LOVE this album, just friggin buy it.
0790737345|3.0|Looking at a couple of Internet sites where viewers can write comments on movies they've seen, by and large \\"City of Angels\\" was written about in almost sacred tones. The underlying theme seemed to be that, if you didn't see the film as something spiritually enlightening, then you missed the point. Alas, I seem to be one of those who failed to see the movie as something special.<br />It's a fairly good picture, and one that should prove to be a decent night's entertainment. It is a romance akin to \\"Ghost\\". <br />The plot twist is that Nicholas Cage plays a guardian angel who becomes infatuated by Ryan's character. When he finds out that it is possible for an angel to give up their immortality and become human, he does so. <br />For American audiences, this transformation probably seemed to be a very original idea. In fact, the movie is a remake of Wim Wenders' 1987 film, \\"Wings of Desire\\". This won numerous awards, particularly for its cinemaphotography. Parts of it were in black and white, others were in color. Some sequences had splashes of color added to the black and white. <br />Because of the almost sacred attitude towards \\"City of Angels\\", I'll try not to be too earthbound in pointing out what I think are weak points in it.<br />First of all, angels are 'in' these days. That's fine with me, but there are angels and then there are angels. The ones in this picture are dressed in ordinary clothes and wear black trench coats. This worked well in the German version, which was far more symbolic. Frankly, in the remake they look both ordinary and a bit ominous. <br />Both versions give the female lead a career which is in some way death defying. The German heroine was a circus acrobat, which fit perfectly. She was an outsider and had a love of flight. \\"City of Angels\\" changes her to a heart surgeon. I suppose this change was made to give the character more control over life and death. It seemed plausible that an eccentric circus performer would believe her new loverused to be an angel. It's hard to envision a well educated and science oriented doctor believing that there really are angels, much less that one could choose to become human just because of her. Perhaps what made this idea so hard for me to accept was that casting Ryan as a heart surgeon is as believable as seeing Leonardo DiCaprio playing one of the stars of the World Federation of Wrestling. Had it been Jodie Foster or Meryl Streep, perhaps I could have bought it. And it is, by the way, Ryan's first big role since \\"Sleepless In Seattle\\" five years ago.. <br />Nicholas Cage does make a superlative angel. In the last few years, he has successfully become mainstream. If you look at his small, lesser known films, you see that his acting range is wide indeed. His immense talent causes us to overlook the fact that it's implausible that an angel would want to experience the pain and sorrow we mere mortals endure. <br />The film is nicely photographed. While Los Angeles is called 'The City of Angeles', I know from having lived there for a long time that it's an unlikely place for such a spiritual event to occur. <br />The end of the film is heart wrenching, yet inevitable. It is Cage's performance that gives it, as well as the rest of the film, such impact. I do not mean to diminish Ryan's capabilities. My opinion is that she was miscast.<br />Wim Wenders is one of Europe's most creative and distinguished directors. Ironically, Brad Silberling, the director of \\"City of Angeles\\", only notable film is \\"Casper\\". As in the friendly ghost.
6300263673|5.0|I loved this film from the first time I saw it. As a little girl I always sang along with the songs and loved the story. <BR>When I reached my teens, my reasons for loving it changed as my hormones went into overdrive.<BR> Patrick Swayze was SOOO HOT!. <BR>And even though I found someone the female characters annoying (probably because they got so close to Patrick, or Lisa Houseman's awful talent show performance.), the cast fit well together and the result is a combination of poignant lessons and raw energy.<BR> Like 'Grease' before it, 'Dirty Dancing' is a major step forward for musicals.<BR>  If you love good music, Patrick Swayze (or Both). You'll wear this out trust me.
0780624890|2.0|What did I expect from Blade? It is, after all, based on a Marvel Comics character that is half-human and half-vampire. From that source, I hardly expect a Blade Runner, Twelve Monkeys or Interview With the Vampire to emerge. Still, some good films have come from comic book characters. These include the first two Batman movies, The Crow and The Mask. <br />I think my disappointment is valid because the producers of Blade obviously intended for it to be better than it is. A lot of money was poured into the sets and special effects. Wesley Snipes is an expensive star. Stephen Dorff is on the rise, and the former child actor takes his career seriously. <br />Often an excellent actor, Snipes plays Blade with neither emotion nor expression. Even his eyes are vacant. Nothing that happens to him in the movie penetrates his chilly facade. He is in a number of high energy martial scenes. These are staged brilliantly, but because of Snipes' monotone performance, there is no feeling of elation when the fights are over. It's all just adrenaline for adrenaline's sake. <br />As the vampire Deacon Frost, Steven Dorff fares much better. He is sublimely menacing and creepy. His problem is with a script which is the written equivalent of Swiss cheese. It takes the vampire myth to new depths. We now have a class system. There are those who were born vampires. Greater in number are those like Deacon Frost who were transformed. They are looked down upon because they will never be pure. Thanks to modern sun block, these half-breeds run around in broad daylight. That's fine, because none of this makes sense. Frost and his pals are able to push the pure vampires around at will. So much for a power struggle. That Dorff can create a memorable character in this mess is a credit to his abilities as an actor. <br />In an unoriginal plot device, victims are lured by the vampires to rave parties in underground discos, where they are dispatched to the sounds of Techno-Industrial dance mixes. The producers, perhaps to push soundtrack CD sales, also chose to use this type of music in the many fight scenes. As a result, these are stripped of much of their power. All succumb to the party atmosphere. I felt I'd rather be dancing.<br />N'Bushe Wright is wasted as a hematologist who is rescued by Blade from a vampire attack in a hospital. She spends the rest of the movie running trying to come up with a cure for the vampire in both of them. At one point she returns to the hospital to pick up some equipment. We don't see the reaction of her coworkers, who think she's dead. She has better luck with the vaccine than she does in her efforts to make Blade smile. The audience quits caring whether he does so or not long before she does. <br />The climax takes place in a huge, digitally rendered underground temple. Here Deacon Frost intends to summon up the Blood God. Judging by the carnage we've already witnessed, I don't know what it's needed for. The temple is supposed to have been built and hidden thousands of years ago, but the lighting looks like GE, while the electrical apparatus is straight from Home Depot.<br />I will stop now before I fall into another plot hole.

B00005B36H|5.0|Wow!! What a great album! From the moment I put this cd into my stereo I knew it was the beginning of a long good relationship.  I've been playing non stop for a while now. What I like best about the album is how the music touches on all tempos...going from extremely hard to the most beautiful touching melodies.  Tool has really mastered the art of capturing a whole experience in their music. This is one of the most powerful albums I have ever heard, if you don't already own it buy it now. Stop reading this review and take your first step towards experiencing the same magic I have, you'll be glad you did.
6304712944|4.0|this film is great but (don't misunderstand me) it took too long to be made... a small hit on broadway in 1960 (it opened on dec.3rd 1960 and people expected a new \\"my fair lady\\") with burton, andrews and goulet, it really did match a whole \\"concept\\" that was very actual at that time: the \\"perfect\\" america (it was jfk's favourite broadway show). the world had changed a lot in 1968/69. woodstock, vietnam were happening and a more realist group of moviemakers were working on films like \\"easy rider\\", \\"they shoot horses, don't they?\\" etc. was there still place for such dreams? richard harris is a great king arthur, vanessa redgrave a beautiful guenevere (i wonder how andrews would have been recreating her original role... josh logan could not be persuaded to let her play guenevere for lack of sex-appeal... the \\"von trapp/poppins image\\" in america would continue to be quite damaging to the career of this actress...) although her voice far too inexpressive. franco nero is beautiful to look at, but seems to be crying all the time. production was sumptuous etc. etc. nowadayy a \\"museum piece\\" it is still marvelous to watch... it has magic! well, that is what camelot meant, wasn't it?<BR>very enjoyable...
B00005RY7X|5.0|I still can not believe that I am hearing this album in the year 2002! Who would have thought that having fun would be a topic again. I grew up on 80's metal, and 80's pop also. This is like a combination of both. Thank God for this guy. It has been forever since I have grinned so big just from listening to a song. The first single did for me. The title sums it all up. &quot;PARTY HARD&quot;. Andrew W.K. has taken rock and roll back to it's roots in a way. Saying, throw out the rule book, don't worry about stupid problems, and just have a great time. THANK GOD FOR ANDREW W.K.!

B00003CXZ4|5.0|People simply don't like these movie because they either can't follow it, can't appreciate a different style of movie, or just love being critics. There might be some other reason, but it's all gibberish to me. Momento is great, it really does keep you guessing until the end. It's well-written, has an interesting story that is told, and it put together fantastically. If you want to watch something entertaining and intellectually-stimulating, buy this. You won't be disappointed.
B00005A46T|3.0|Man, did these guys have a rude awakening or what...Yikes...I thought when I first heard this album. I have moved on in my ways, and you could say, mellowed out a bit, so this album didn't fit into the whole, 'let's chill and drink some beer' type attitude. I will say this. It is hard to stay an overly aggresive band such as this, without...erm...selling out. Whether you want to believe it or not...these guys are starting to sell out...they kept the sound...but look at them...the 'custom' made masks, the apperance on the new Rollerball movie...Now I do admire them for finding some great new talent in the new metal scene(Mudvayne is on a totally different level then these guys)...but Slipknot needs to come up with some better lyrics or something...

B00000ING2|5.0|The Coens' Masterwork merits a place in the upper echelon of hysteria and oblique humour.  The near cameo placement of Bruce Campbell is a wonderful homage, and my only regret is the utterly overplayed role of Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Her character's treatment is admirable but the vocal 240 wpm is a bit grating at times.  Notice Steve Buscemi survives an appearance in a Coen Bros. film also!  His hepcat/beatster bartender is in no way murdered!  Go figure.  Robbins is as always, delightful, and Paul Newman is in high form and cast perfectly as the embodiment of corporate greed with Hudsucker Industries.  The plot of \\"use and discard a substitute to plummet stock value and swoop in and buy company on the ...[low cost]-gone wrong\\" is most definitely entertaining.  And the narration breaks are fantastic, probably the best edited film of the mid-90's.  A must have for any connisuer of the Coens.  A great New Years flick (for obvious reasons) that sort of hearkens back to the days of William Powell and the Thin Man series.  Only our hero is a paradoxical \\"genius\\"; not a decisive, witty highball swilling madman.  Watch it twice for the subtleties.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s second full length attempt continues their tradition of completely extraordinary, breathtaking music. The songs buildup, climax, and end wonderfully. The music can be described as a profound, dramatic orchestral effort combining 3 guitars, 2 bassists, 2 drummers, violin, and cello, with eletronic ambience.  It is not 'classical' in overall sound, but partly in song structure. It is extremely postmodern.    You must have patience.  There is a lot of ambience within this album.  However, it is definitely worth it to listen to songs in their full length, even though they are quite long songs (usually around 20 minutes each.)  The songs also contain much buildup:  like an approaching thunderstorm, the clouds come in setting the scene for the beautiful cataclsym at hand.  The forceful wind arrives and wrecks the setting that was once full of grace.  Lightning bolts with thundering crashes fill the scene with fear but awe at the same time...      If you are a post-rock fan, or just want to hear something different and new, look into this album and the rest of GYBE!. But if you enjoy short pop songs, then this is not for you.
B00005ASOI|2.0|I first read about this movie saying it was one of the best horror films ever and then a good friend of mine,Rich, told me he had it and I watched it. What a dumb film.<BR>The story is about an American dance student who attends a European ballet school only to find it is a witches coven. As with all Argnto's films there is a good deal of unneeded blood and graphic scene's to keep you woundering why the hell you are watching this. The story developes very slowly so by the climax you really have lost intrest and you watch it to see what happens almost out of obligation.<BR>Over rated and dim witted this film leaves a bad taste and an even worse memory.
B00005Y228|5.0|I was already biased toward Kylie Minogue after having seen her wonderful performance in Moulin Rouge, although I never went out to buy her CD or anything. I saw her video recently on MTV (&quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;) and I was like, &quot;Whoa. Great song. Great video. Must buy CD.&quot; I was expecting a CD full of catchy dance tunes and I was not disappointed. If you're like me and only heard &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; (which is a song you really can't get out of your head) before buying the CD, and liked it, you'll enjoy the rest of the songs as well. I just want to know why it is that Britney Spears is so much more famous than Kylie Minogue, who is much prettier and sings better. What a world.
630157401X|5.0|After the critical and commercial failure of Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas returned to the sure-fire formula of the Indiana Jones franchise. Opting to steer away from the darkness of Temple of Doom and go for a more light-hearted adventure, Last Crusade suceeds wonderfully, with the pairing of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford producing one of the best on-screen pairings since Newman and Redford. John Rhys-Davies makes a welcome return as Sallah, Indy's guide and friend. While not as strong as Karen Allen in Raiders, Alison Doody make a good impression as Elsa, a german women who seduces Indy. The villians are great with Walter Donavan (Julian Glover) as an evil german intent on retrieving the Holy Grail. The action set-pieces are top-notch, with speedboat chases, tank chases, plane chases and all rounded off with an exciting finale, Last Crusade ends the trilogy perfectly. When the film was realesed in 1989, it was greeted with critical praise and box-office triumph.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|Saw this film last night and have to say I was extremely relieved to have finally seen a decent scary movie for a change, instead of the teen-slasher, no-plot, know-whats-happening-next films that have plagued the genre for a while now.  It looks low budget but not too low budget, but it doesn't detract from the storytelling.  It reminded me of when I was young, telling scary stories late at night to friends.<br />It does have it's scary moments - I have to say I did jump a few times (the crows - eek!  I'll make a bird pie methinks...), and it didn't stray from the path it was taking, but it wasn't a film that would keep me awake at night.  However I really felt cheated with the ending - what a let down!  Maybe it was supposed to be, I don't know, because it does leave you wanting to know more.<br />I would recommend this film - it is worth seeing.  It won't blow you away, but it will keep you entertained no end.  I should've went to see it in the cinema, even with it's poor ending, but if they ever make a sequel, and here's hoping they do, I'll be the first in the queue to see it in the cinema!

B00005UQD5|4.0|Session 9 (Brad Anderson, 2001)<br /><br />Since Scream, America has been inundated with horror films that want to be hip and trendy. Leave it to Hollywood to overlook the hippest and trendiest of them. Session 9 is The Others without an A-list actor to lend it credibility; it's all about atmosphere rather than shock value. That will probably turn most horror film fans off, but the true aficionado will find a whole lot here to like.<br /><br />The premise is a nice one: a team of asbestos removal workers, led by two guys with the unassuming names of Phil (David Caruso) and Gordon (Peter \\"My Name is Joe\\" Mullan), are hired to clear out an old asylum. The crew finds a series of tapes regarding a particular patient, and they start listening to them on breaks. The closer they get to the end of the therapy, the more tense things get in the real world.<br /><br />It's probably no coincidence that there are a whole lot of visual similarities between this film and the computer game version of John Saul's series novel The Blackstone Chronicles. Certain scenes could have been lifted straight from the game, and the actors dropped in. That said, it's probably not a coincidence that the two offer the viewer the same atmosphere, a slow, relentless building of tension. What makes Session 9 different than The Blackstone Chronicles (and The Others, for that matter), is that the right questions to ask in the game are irrelevant at the climax of the film. Whether the ghosts are all in the workers' heads or not doesn't matter a bit, except as post-film coffee-table discussion fodder. Anderson hands us the set of questions we expect, and then answers them with the answers to a completely different set. It's a beautiful thing; tends to put off people who don't like surprises (or, at least, those who like their surprises to come within a predetermined set of choices; e.g. most fans of your average run-of-the-mill horror flick), but done right can propel a film to greatness. This one comes pretty close. **** ½pretty close. **** ½
6304806434|4.0|Jerry Bruckheimer movies are always expected to have big bangs, great stunts and explosive action, and Con Air is no exception. With a great cast including Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, John Malcovich, Steve Buscemi and Ving Rhames, this action spectacular starts off with a plane full off America's deadliest criminals en route to prison. Unsurprisingly, the cons have a plan to escape and take over the plane, and Nic Cage has to try and stop the crims and get home alive. It's all very predictable and silly, but with a premise like this one, you're not excactly expecting Shakespeare. And this is one of those high-octane action flicks like The Rock (1995), where the relentless action set-pieces paper over the plot holes. Said action is excellent  with great stunts, a sharp script and some witty one-liners from Buscemi. Then events start to get silly when we are greeted with the &quot;let's see how much stuff we can destroy&quot; ending in Las Vegas. Regardless, it's one of the better action films in recent years, and great fun in a non-challenging way.

Armed with a huge voice and his Gargantuan ape chorus (totally cool), he will blow you away.  Suprisingly, he writes some very decent lyrics (&quot;She Is Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Fun Night&quot;, &quot;Party Hard&quot;), combining with some major headbanging riffs to assult and destroy your senses-but trust me, you'll love every minute of it.  He even throws some 80's in the mix, with his piano coming forward for about 10 seconds in most songs, sometimes even carrying the chorus.  Why is it scary?  Listen to the chorus of &quot;Party 'Til You Puke&quot;-he's really serious about this party stuff, it gives you a pretty graphic image in your mind of exactly what he's talking about.  The album does have some faults, just like most others.  &quot;I Love New York City&quot;, while putting a good message out, is a terrible piece of writing.  &quot;I love New York City!/Oh yeah!/New York City!&quot;-come on, you can come up with better than that.  And yes, the album tails off a bit towards the end, but you'll be recovering from the first 25 minutes so it won't matter.  Get this CD, all you metalheads and you won't regret it.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Apocalypse Now Redux (Francis Ford Coppola, 2001)<br /><br />[Before reading this, please take note: the original cut of Apocalypse Now resides on my all-time top-100 films list. I don't hate the original. Honest.]<br /><br />It is a long-known fact of Hollywood life that directors and studios are most at each others' throats when it comes time to edit a film for final release.  Judging by the various directors' cuts I've seen over the years, ninety-nine percent of the time, the director is right (anyone who's seen both the theatrical release and directors' cut versions of Profondo Rosso knows exactly what I'm getting at, and it's hard to argue with the superiority of directors'-cut releases of such films as Aliens, Bladerunner, etc.). One percent of the time, the director is wrong. Francis Ford Coppola's new, fifty-three-minute-longer, cut of Apocalypse Now rides right on the line.<br /><br />It's hard to call Apocalypse Now Redux a true director's cut; the full film runs two hours longer than Redux (and can be found on the underground market readily, if one knows where to look). However, the almost-hour of footage put back in to the film gives the viewer an idea of where Coppola was headed with the full version, and in all honesty, it's nowhere the original cut doesn't go. Much of the extra footage just repeats the same themes over and over again that we got the first time, and the repetition, along with the greater continuity one gains in the longer cut, dull the dadaist quality that makes the original such a hallucinatory experience.<br /><br />Not to say that all the cuts the studio made originally were right on. The two climactic episodes in the film, those with Kilgore and Kurtz, are lengthened nicely; while Marlon Brando could have been much better-used (as he seemed to be in the original cut; here, he goes from being a haunting, psychotic dictator to just another antiwar protestor who's gone way out of control), Robert Duvall's turn as Kilgore is underlined as the brilliant role it always has been, and during the Kurtz scenes, Dennis Hopper and Martin Sheen both shine more than they previously had. The lengthenings of these two parts are a minor portion of what got put back in, but they're well worth the cost of a rental for those who are familiar with the original cut.<br /><br />The main portion of the restored footage, though, could have been left on the cutting room floor without too many people noticing. They're there to reinforce the horrors of war, etc., but it's not as if even the less astute viewers of the original cut aren't going to pick up on the theme without having these extra scenes added.<br /><br />I never thought I'd say it, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the new cut. Twenty or so years from now, maybe we'll get an official release of the five-and-a-half hour version that'll redeem this, but for the moment, I strongly recommend seeing Apocalypse Now Redux only for those who have already seen the original and want to deepen their understanding of what Coppola was on about. Those coming to the movie fresh would be better served by finding a pal with a really good home theater system and renting the DVD of the original release first. Someone wiser than I once said of the original cut, \\"Apocalypse Now is not about Vietnam; Apocalypse Now IS Vietnam.\\" Given that, Apocalypse Now Redux is, unfortunately, \\"about\\" Vietnam in a way the original cut never was. ** ½as the brilliant role it always has been, and during the Kurtz scenes, Dennis Hopper and Martin Sheen both shine more than they previously had.

B00005N83M|4.0|As much as I like Jennifer Lopez, I'm afraid this CD gets old fast. The only one's worth listening to are \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\", \\"Play\\", \\"Aint It Funny\\", \\"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\\" and \\"Secretly.\\" Her voice eventually gets annoying. She shouldn't try singing so hard. Just use it nice and lightly. I mean, look at how well Gloria Estifan used her decent voice when it was not exactly really spectacular. \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright\\" is another good upbeat song and the remix (featuring 50 Cent) is just as good. The Rodney \\"DarkChild\\" Jenkins track \\"That's The Way\\" is fun but still only mediocore. \\"DarkChild\\" hasn't produced a good-quality song since 1999. I'm not gonna even go into how bad the original \\"I'm Real\\" is. It really needed remixing big time...so call on Murder Inc; it sounds great! As for her next release she needs to work less on trying to sing like she has an extremely powerful voice (like christina has). Otherwise I would only reccomend this to teenagers and the diehard fans. Overall grade for \\"J LO\\": C/C+
B00005AXEL|4.0|How come Lindsey Buckingham can't make albums this good?
0062502182|1.0|Although this book suggests Free will by urging us to follow our heart in essence it is a hymn to fatality. It tells the story of a young shepherd who gets a dream of a treasure hidden in Egypt and decides to follow it. But all along the way his learnings (and ours) are that things are predetermined. So long as we stick to our dream, that is. Apparently that is why we are here on Earth. To discover our 'personal legend', as it is called in the book. And then fulfil it. If we set on such a course the Universe will conspire to help us succeed (as happens with the protagonist of the book).<br />Being a free-willed person I have a problem with all that. The idea that I do not control my destiny is unthinkable. The whole notion that things are pre-decided is simply pathetic. A throwback to the superstitious dark ages. As for the author's insistence that if we discover and follow our predetermined mission (OK, 'personal legend', sounds nicer) the Cosmos will turn on its head to make sure we succeed, it would have been laughable if it wasn't downgrading. What differentiates us from animals? What makes us winners if not Free will? This book has been likened to the Bible. Not the Bible I know. Possibly the one for fatalists.
B000007U6V|5.0|this album is really great.the title track,autobahn,is one of the groups most well known songs-and rightly so.and at 22 minutes,it's too short!the next track,kometenmelodie 1 is slow and dark.it would make good halloween music.this track then changes into kometenmelodie 2,which is a quite cheerful,happy song,fun to listen to.mitternacht is similar to kometenmelodie 1.it is also dark and haunting,prehaps more than kometenmelodie 1.morgenspaizergang is simply electronic bird chirps along with a beautiful flue melody,the perfect end to a rather perfect album.sure,trans-europe and man machine are classics,but this one started it all.a classic,highlr reccomended.also,check out earlier kraftwerk,like kraftwerk 2,or tone float with the organisation,those are also good.

B000000W9Z|1.0|David, you are, and always will be my all time favourite artist of all time, but this is total tosh and I think you know it!  It's very clever, it really is.  I mean the concept, the story is way out there Dave, but what happened to the music?  I've tried listening to this, and just failed miserably.<br />Having said all that it's worth getting for &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot;, which is real David Bowie, and has become one of my favourite songs of all time.<br />All our friends<BR>Now seem so thin and frail<BR>Slinky secrets<BR>Hotter than the sun<br />No peachy prayers<BR>No trendy rechauffé<BR>I'm with you<BR>So I can't go on<br />When you sing &quot;Slinky secrets in that low register I get goosepimples.  Apparently the bassline is from your previous 1967 song &quot;Join the Gang&quot;, hmmm.  I thought it was reminiscent of Heroes or &quot;Gimme some Lovin'&quot; by Booker T and the MG's!<br />Whatever, the melody, vocals and pathos are totally brilliant, and personally I think it's one of your best songs.  And this is me, a dedicated fan of Ziggy, Aladdin, Dogs and up to Tin Machine 1 and the wonderful &quot;Amazing&quot;.<br />So sorry folks, if you want a melodic DB this is not the album for you, and I'm afraid phase-looped Eastend accents are not for me, but are clever all the same.<br />Alan
6301247485|2.0|I could watch this film over and over, and was delighted to find it at Amazon.com. But I was bitterly disappointed to discover that the original score had been replaced. I would not have made this purchase had I known. With the original score, I'd rate The Great Gatsby 5 stars.
0060934913|5.0|Like many readers probably did, I got my first \\"taste\\" of Tony Bourdain's prose in the pages of The New Yorker, where one of the more infamous chapters of Kitchen Confidential (you know the one I'm talking about -- are you planning to eat mussels and swordfish anytime real soon?) was excerpted prior to the book's publication.  And in that little morsel, we got a sense of just what we were in for when this book hit the stores: a perpetually (often self-consciously) hip style, total lack of qualms about delving into the grime and grunge of the restaurant business, and a great comedic flair.<br />Like many others, I actually laughed out loud while reading Kitchen Confidential -- it's that good.  The way that Mr. Bourdain studiously deflates the rarefied aura that so many celebrity chefs today work so hard at cultivating is refreshing, as is his unconcealed loathing for one Fall River-expat in New Orleans (believe me, Tony, you're not alone!  When I saw him drop a bundle of asparagus into a pot of boiling water, saying that he tied them together to keep them from floating apart in the pot, I knew that he was a certifiable hack, too!).  Yes, the fact that he's now channel-mates with that very same hack is indeed ironic (especially after one reads his line in KC mocking that very possibility), and after watching him on TV, the inescapable conclusion is that he's better taken through the medium of prose.  Still, you won't do better than this gem of a book.
B00005ARDC|4.0|This is a good cd. I heard &quot;Whatever Happened To My Rock N Roll&quot; online, and I thought that was an amazing song. I waited about a month, and then I bought the cd. I only listened to &quot;Love Burns&quot;, and the song I mentioned above for about a week, and then I put it away, and forgot about it. I picked it up a month later, and I enjoyed it more than ever.<br />&quot;Love Burns&quot; is still my favorite song on the album, with a great drum beat, and trippy vocals. The whole album is very trippy. Some other great songs are &quot;Red Eyes and Tears&quot;, which has great guitar effects, and &quot;Head Up High.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.
B000056K04|2.0|Angel is witout doubt a superb song and shows off Mathews vocal ability to trip from high falsetto to reverberating low register with fantastic effect.  Very moving, melodic, full of pathos, real goosepimple stuff.  \\"Space Between\\" has been played to death, and although it's a magnificent song with a mesmerising melody, I struggle to not skip the track these days, unless I'm in  really good mood and I really want a song to rattle the car windows with as I zap up the I405!<br />The rest of the tracks were a real disappointment I have to say.  Nice, with some ctachy tunes, but nothing on the same scale as the above two
B000002LHX|5.0|Not to be confused with Danny Elfman's instrumental release for the same movie, this soundtrack for the first Batman, is one of the best movie soundtracks ever released. Prince created a soundtrack that moves with the movie. It is not just a compilation of songs that you hear in the background of a movie, like many soundtracks that are hastily put together. This CD is full of dialogue from the movie and from Prince's imagination. Prince put a lot of heart, soul and funk into this recording.<br />Songs:<BR>THE FUTURE is the opening song that sets the stage for the dark future that The Joker has in mind for Gothem. It full of techno, synthesized sounds that are held together with Prince's rhythm guitar.<BR>ELECTRIC CHAIR comes out with hard guitar riffs by one of the greatest guitarist in the pop/rock world.<BR>THE ARMS OF ORION - What a pretty song. It is sung as a duet between Bruce Wayne (Prince) and Vicki Vale (Sheena Easton). It is a soft, sad love song that is held together by the beautiful piano and a string section.<BR>PARTYMAN - What more can I say except to quote Jack, \\"Gentlemen, let's broaden our minds!\\" Everyone listening to this can picture Jack Nicholson as the Joker strutting thru the museum with his henchmen and a boombox. Very Funky.<BR>VICKI'S WAITING - Another dance track. The song is about Batman wondering if and when he should tell Vicki Vale that he is Bruce Wayne.<BR>TRUST - Another upbeat dance track that was used when the Joker is riding on his float in a parade through downtown Gothem. <BR>LEMON CRUSH - Club tune. The only song I can not envision in the Batman movie. Still a good tune.<BR>SCANDALOUS - Love or Sex? Everyone who is a Prince fan knows this is one of his songs (Insatiable, Damn U, Do Me Baby, The Beautiful Ones, and Adore) that is great for romancing with the one you love. Great Song!<BR>BATDANCE - Great Finale. Prince starts the songs with 3 loud guitar riffs, then the Joker speaks. He weaves Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, and Jack Nicholson into this song that incorporates all aspects of the movie.<br />This soundtrack has a soul of its own.
B00000AOTZ|4.0|A very solid rock soundtrack that holds together as a unified<br />whole. The album is tethered by two great highlights: Joe<br />Walsh's first take on &quot;In the City&quot; (which he later re-recorded<br />with the Eagles for their &quot;Long Run album; the version here<br />is better) and Desmond Child's &quot;Last of an Ancient Breed&quot; which<br />is undoubtedly the best Springsteen imitation ever recorded--better<br />than a lot of what Springsteen himself was recording at the<br />same time.<br />dap
B00005JKGV|3.0|I'm a big fan of David Lynch's other work and I wish I could tell you I loved this movie.  Lynch's minimalist style leaves you wondering what's going on and where things are headed.  This makes for some unbelievable tension that keeps you glued to the screen wanting to know what's next.  He keeps you guessing and usually wraps things up at the end by bringing light to the confusion and exposing the manipulation.  I love his technique...it's a roller coaster ride!  However, at the end of Lost Highway I was more confused than ever.  If you love David Lynch...you'll love this movie right up until you're left with the credits and too many unanswered questions.  If you've never watched a David Lynch movie, don't start with this one.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I have been lusting after this film for years. <br />A good friend just sent me a link to... a dvd website, and according to them a deal has finally been made to release the film to dvd. It is scheduled for release late this year.<br />It coincides with the theatrical release of the fourth film in the series- \\"Naqoyqatsi<br />I hope this is true, and I wanted to pass this on to all the other Koyaanisqatsi fans out there.
B000051YD6|5.0|Both recordings have satisfied me enormously.  I find these performances so alluring that I have returned to them more often that I care to remember.  What a masterly way of coming home for superb musicians like Arrau and Davis.  Most rewarding seems to be the maturity, depthness, pause and authority of delivery, from both Arrau and Davis.  Sound quality is first class as well.  I recall that these recordings, along with the rest of the cycle, won the 1989 Japan Record Academy Award.
B000002HK4|4.0|One of the best DT songs ever written and performed, is among my top 5 DT songs. This song is basically what you're buying the cd for, although there are 4 other songs on the album, they are all live covers.<br />A change of seasons was originally written in 1989 and wasn't recorded until 1995, of course the song had some changes done to it, and i think the final product is a masterpeice. Logging in at about 23 minutes, this song is an epic. The song spans 7 different parts all on one track. (the crimson sunrise, innocence, carpe diem, the darkest of winters, another world, the inevitable summer, the crimson sunset).<br />This song is fairly catchy actually, despite its length and it never gets boring. <br />Labrie, Myung, Petrucci, Portnoy and Sherinian all did a fantastic job on this song.<br />Of course the cd does not give you just that. The rest of the CD has 4 cover songs, recorded live at Ronnie Scott's Jazz show in London. <br />Of these i like the last one the best, The big medley, as it covers part of bohemian rhapsody. <br />I don't really care for the covers that much but the cd is definetely worth it for the title track.
0061020680|5.0|I started reading discworld much like other readers, a friend told me.  When I started reading I couldn't put them down.  But one in particular really got to me.  \\"Mort\\" Was the only book I ever got done reading in one day.  The book was so good I had to read it again.  \\"Mort\\" is the story about Death, with a big D, and the mishaps that occure when he gets an apprentice.  During the story Mortimer (or mort for short) Finds that he can't do the job very well when he accidently kills the wrong person.  Now he has the matter of a few days to set the course of history right While trying to maintiane a relationship with a girl, and doing the job of death. That's a big order to fill.  I don't want to give away the ending because it is just to good.  All I can say is pick up this book you won't regret it.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is the best album EVER. If you don't already have this CD, I recomend you stop everything you're doing and buy it right now. The two best songs are Longview and Basketcase, but all the other songs are great too. So go buy it!
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is Metallica's best album in terms of sound and musically.  Master of Puppets is like a hidden gem everytime you listen to it.  The songs never get old or fade.  The lyrics stick in your head and leave you wanting more and more. Very few albums are made so perfectly as Master of Puppets was.  The song content is unbelievable and solid in every way shape and form.  Master starts out with the first song BATTERY starts very slowly for the first couple second and then goes into a fury of madness that continues throughout each track until the final seconds of DAMAGE INC.  <br />Every song hits its timing with the sound of the music. Metallica has always had excellent opening songs on each of their albums, but Battery is by far the best.  Next song on the album is the title Track MASTER OF PUPPETS the Lyrical content is amazing.  It just fits right and blends well after Battery ends.  THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE the 3rd song on the album is spooky and chilling to the bone.  The struggle with ones insanity is compelling and sounds outstanding.  Whats more is the ending to the song.  It sets up the strongest song on the album SANATRIUM.  This song is striking and powerful all the way through about a condemed man in a psycho ward.  Once you hear the song it never leaves you.  You can relate it to a million different things and how you feel.  Like FADE TO BLACK and ONE on the other albums usually the 4th song is the most powerful of them all and defines the alubm.  Right on the heals of SANATRIUM is the next song DISPOSABLE HEROES the reality of sending your son off to war knowing that he will probably be killed.  This song is awesome and so underrated.  &quot;Back to the Front&quot; That line is classic.  LEPER MESSIAH is next the 6th song on the album although very good song I still to this day think it is the weakest song on the album.  The sound to the song is unique and cool but it just seems slowed down from the speed of the other songs.  ORION the best instrumental song of all time.  It blows the Call of Ktulu out of the water.  Perfection nothing more to say about this song.<BR>     <BR>And capping it all of with DAMAGE INC. <BR>Master of Puppets was the first album I ever bought of the band and has been the smartest decision of my life.  It is greatness with a capital G.  I have heard it about a 100 times and whenever I hear a song off the album on the radio I am saddened when they don't play the next song off the album.  Thats truely how good this piece of work is.  The Black Album burst Metallica to stardom but MASTER is where the best of their work lies.  And if you don't believe me buy the album for yourself and you'll see.

B00002MZ12|5.0|This is an excellent CD for all Alanis fans. She brings the songs into a different light, and brings a different value of quality to them. Many of them are more laid back songs with a more natural feeling to them, without all the different production, instead there is the guitar, violins, flutes, and just unplugged instruments. She really does well on &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; which I always thought to be a jewel in the crown, a wonderful emotionally driven song. The version of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; is in my opinion better than the original because you can feel the emotion in her voice. Same for &quot;Uninvited&quot;, which appeared originally on the CITY OF ANGELS OST. There is also some new songs here, such as the excellent &quot;Princes Familiar&quot;, &quot;No Pressure Over Cappuccino&quot;, &quot;King of Pain&quot; (originally by the Police) and &quot;These R The Thoughts&quot;. And some of her big hits like &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, and some other tracks such as &quot;I Was Hoping&quot;. Overall its a great buy and this one will be in your CD player constantly!

0375703764|5.0|\\"This is not for you\\"<br />So starts the \\"House of Leaves\\" an incredible, complicated, fast paced, and at times tedious journey that details the downward spiral of the lives and minds of its characters as they come into contact (at varying degrees) with a \\"house\\" and what haunts it.<br />As the book unfolds, the reader is seemingly eased into what becomes a malestrom of footnotes, differing storylines, and a plethora of information trying to describe and define just what is going on in this house (only to turn an abrubt 180 and shoot down the aforementioned theory- definately confusing the reader and casting doubt in their own theories). The ultimate purpose of all this is to take the reader on a journey similar to the character, one that maddens and frustrates as you find the footnotes reference themselves and some don't even exist, that many litrary references are indeed simply made up, that the text itself takes shape- crawling up the sides and becoming bullet paths and holes.<br />In my humble opinion this book should not be placed in the category of \\"horror\\". For while it does (at times) terrify, that is not the great theme of it. Indeed the theme is not truly in the story itself, but in the way it is told.<br />With its maddening precision and constant derision (directed at all) this book is NOT for you. This book is for one man alone.....the author. Because only he can truly understand it.<br />However, if you do decide to try..... you will NOT be dissapointed. Not in the least.<br />Like SOME body said, <BR>\\"I did not finish this book....It finished me.\\"<br />True

0440219078|5.0|Ah, The Giver is one of those few books which can completely captivate the mind and soul... and can do so with such simplistic and discernable writing.<br />The Giver is the story of a futuristic society where choices are premade, emotions are fake, and human urges are supressed.  Jonas is the novel's protagonist. He is an intelligent child who quickly finds out that this 'utopian' society is much more of a dystopian hell.<br />As I read through this book, I was able to find shades of Orwell's 1984 or Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD; however, The Giver is quite distinct.  Though it's concepts are not new, the way in which they are presented are quite spectacular.<br />My advice would be to not read the reviews... for they will only ruin the book for you. As I read the book (having not previously known the action of the story) I was actually shocked and almost driven to tears at points.  I was amazingly affected by this spectacular novel.<br />Finally, to clear up the misunderstanding about the book's ambiguous ending.  This ending NEEDED to be the conclusion. Thus we can truly decide if this novel should be considered a utopian or dystopian world.  Compare this to the other great 'dystopian' novels 1984 and BRAVE NEW WORLD... both have a definate ending.<br />This novel gives the reader a chance to believe... a chance to have faith... but most importantly, it gives the reader hope:  a hope which The Community would never be able to 'release.'...
0393317552|3.0|The author presents a very compelling argument about just how humanity progressed on the various continents from 13,000 to 500 years ago.  Some 60% of the book's material is of this compelling nature, and even the most skeptical readers will find themselves thinking, \\"Of course, that -has- to be true, even if it is difficult to prove.\\"  I find no difficulty with his primary hypothesis, that initial resources promoted plant and animal domestication, especially in the Fertile Crescent of Eurasia, and the lack of such resources on other continents (and the various South Pacific islands) is the primary reason that development elsewhere was retarded or even halted.<br />I have some difficulty with his secondary hypothesis, that the lack of development elsewhere had nothing to do with racial characteristics or capabilities.  I do not disagree with his secondary hypothesis, but I think it very much distracts his argument for the primary one.  It is this hypothesis that accounts for the author's dwelling on themes characterized by some as being \\"politically correct\\" or even \\"Marxist.\\"  The author's preoccupation with these themes comprises about 10% of the book, and is where the author's arguments become the sloppiest.  Some examples:<br />1) (pp. 22-23) He argues that New Guineans seem to him smarter than typical Westerners, and offers various hypothetical explanations as to why.  While his goal is, I think, to demonstrate the absurdity of the argument, he does not explicitly argue that way.  Significantly, he ignores the most likely reason for his perception, a selection effect:  of course, the New Guineans seem smarter as a whole, because he won't be spending his time talking with those who are not as bright.  Also, he has a much stronger cultural context by which to judge the ignorance of Westerners than New Guineans.<br />2) (pp. 64, 67, 252, 317)  Europeans \\"discover\\" (always in quotes) the Americas, Hawaii, or New Guinea, but (p. 209) typhus microbes discovered (notin quotes) other means of infection.  This is ubiquitous PC, but annoying nonetheless.  I'm willing to concede that Columbus in 1492 was not \\"the\\" discovery of the Americas, but not that it was not really a discovery.  Quotes should indicate using a word in an unconventional manner, or to actually quote someone's opinion, otherwise they are just snide.  The microbes \\"discovery\\" should be in quotes, because it is not intelligent, while Columbus actually did discover something, even if he was not the first.<br />3) (p. 199)  The author writes:  \\"The skin lesions caused by smallpox similarly spread microbes by direct or indirect body contact (occasionally very indirect, as when U.S. whites bent on wiping out 'belligerent' Native Americans sent them gifts of blankets previously used by smallpox patients).\\"  This parenthetical comment is nonfactual, and is a kind of historical urban legend.  A search engine query on \\"smallpox blankets indians\\" provides plenty of background.  The grain of truth is that during the French and Indian war, British General Jeffry Amherst wrote about doing something like that, and  it is unclear the extent to which it was done.  There are no other documented instances.  This truth differs from the author's account on several points:  there was no \\"U.S.\\" yet; it was not \\"whites\\" in general; and as for \\"bent on wiping out\\" and \\"'belligerent'\\" there was a war going on.  Official U.S. policy of the mid-19th century was to vaccinate Native Americans against smallpox.  The problem of ubiquitous PC is that these kinds of comments can enter into scholarly work without being questioned.<br />4) (p. 287)  The author writes:  \\"Large societies can function economically only if they have a redistributive economy in addition to a reciprocal economy.  Goods in excess of an individual's needs must be transferred from the individual to a centralized authority, which then redistributes the goods to individuals with deficits.\\"  This is one spot where the book appears to be Marxist.  The author mentions elsewhere that a lot of the redistribution was from the people to the government, such as using slaves to build pyramids, yet here mentions only the ideal of helping those less well-off.  Nor does he mention the role of government in providing a trustworthy medium of exchange, called \\"money,\\" that is the primary reason that a large society can function economically.  Don't look to this book for a coherent economic analysis of primitive societies.<br />Aside from the PC issues, the book has other milder problems.  After hitting on several good points about how something likely came to be, he adds even more that are of questionable value and scholarship.  For example (p. 129), among his arguments on why the acorn did not become a source of food is that acorns and squirrels evolved around each other, and with the squirrels still around, humans essentially had no chance to domesticate the acorn.  This is a marvelous explanation, but it completely fails as a hypothesis, since it is essentially not provable.  This detracts from the material because such explanations are given equal weight with others that are far more convincing.  <br />The author habitually makes 'ad hoc', and 'post hoc ergo propter hoc' arguments.  In part, this is due to the material.  As he mentions in the epilogue, this isn't a science like physics where one can perform experiments, but we only have the evidence of the past.  We take the present as the starting point and ask how we got here, and if we are not careful with the facts, we end up with explanations that aren't explanations, but rather excuses as to why another explanation doesn't work in this particular case.<br />In spite of these difficulties, this is a monumental work, and very much worth reading.  I would advise readers to be skeptical of much of the author's reasoning, but the author's primary thesis is boldly presented, and for that core thesis my main criticisms are only nitpicks.
0689815816|5.0|There aren't very many words in this book, but it is a GREAT story.  I bought it for my husband who is a professional storyteller.  He plans to use the story when 'telling' to young children. <br />Very imaginative and colorful story!  I highly recommend it for infants and young toddlers.
B00005OM4N|2.0|When I bought I thought that it was good (well of course I thought other wise I wouldnt buy it, but anyway), but it really wasnt. I kinda disspointed cause this record almost [is bad]. We only have like 3 songs that are really good and they are \\"Lonley\\", \\"Not a girl, not yet a woman\\" and \\"What its like to be me\\" where Justin Timberlike sings along. Then we only have songs that are okay and songs that are really bad. The songs who are OK are \\"Overprotected\\", \\"I love rocknroll\\", \\"Thats where you take me\\" and then we have the terrible songs and they are \\"Boys\\", \\"Anticipating\\", \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Im a slave 4 U\\" and the most terrible song ever is \\"Bombastic Love\\" that one is so bad I skip it. The album is very confused because she mixes styles (hiphop and pop) and it doesnt turn out well. For example is \\"Boys\\" this song who is very hiphop and she talking through the whole song and in \\"Anticipating\\" shes like so happy and sings pop when its the worsest. The songs doesnt match each other. I have never really liked her voice that much cause I think she sometimes sound like a frog, but I like her voice on her debut album \\"Baby..one more time\\" but on this album its not that good, maybe she should take vocal lessons or just hang on to her old voice. Either way, my advice to you guys who thinking  about if you should buy this album or not: dont buy it. Buy her first album instead because that one is great,and if you already got that one buy her second album \\"Oops...I did it again\\" which is okay, but if you really like her you should buy it, but Im afraid youre going to be disspointed because I was, because the \\"Britney\\" doesnt sound like the Britney we know from her past albums. So I actully think you shoould spend your money on something else. I hope you guys got some help from my review.
B00004S6GL|4.0|Elliott Smith doesn't strike me as the kind of singer who's after fame and fortune--he always looks a little startled and uncomfortable in photographs, even on his own album covers--but he might just have to deal with the fact that one of these days the world is going to wake up to his superb songs and come beating at his door.<br />Smith is one of the more original songwriters out there today.  His vulnerability comes through in &quot;Somebody that I Used to Know,&quot; where he is able to combine &quot;go to hell&quot; with &quot;I miss you&quot; beautifully:<br />&quot;I had tender feelings that you made hard<BR>But it's your heart, not mine, that's scarred<BR>So when I go home I'll be happy to go<BR>You're just somebody that I used to know<BR>You don't need my help anymore,<BR>It's all now to you, there ain't no before . . . &quot;<br />Much has been made of Smith's Beatlesesque sound and there's no denying the influence of the Beatles on his work.  Still, he manages to incorporate the best of the distinctive Beatles sound without ever once sounding derivative or unoriginal.  More than a lot of singer/songwriters out there can claim.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This DVD is totally outstanding. There is no group in the world that plays so good live. Dream Theater's live performances are unsurpassed, let alone impressive. The sound on this DVD is very good and the picture is crystal clear. My favourite song is Through Her Eyes, which features an excellent guitar solo. I have one negative remark only. I am a little dissatisfied with the selection of songs. I wish they played Another Day, Pull Me Under, Take The Time... Nevertheless, I highly recommend this DVD to all Dream Theater's fans and people, in general, who appreciate good music.

B000005JA8|3.0|Devotees adore this record and, as devotees are inclined to, get very defensive about it. Then again, devotees adore &amp; get defensive about Pink Floyd's Umma Gumma, anything in the artistic canon of Yes, and nothing you can do or say will change their minds.<br />So this review isn't for devotees, it's for casual listeners wanting to explore the back streams - trout breeding grounds, if you will - of contemporary music culture, who may be thinking about checking this forgotten treasure out.<br />For the record, I'm exactly such a casual listener. I have known about this record by reputation for years, but I just got round to buying it today. I've listened to it, think I understand it, but I don't propose to ever listen to it again.<br />Scroll back to the early seventies. What Don Van Vliet was doing here was whacky, stoned-out, totally avante garde, and very influential - there are big fat strains in here of the lo-fi and self-consciously weird elements which run through music to this day - I heard Beck and later (Mule Variations) Tom Waits coming through loud and clear. My three stars are for its obvious influence and what it must have sounded like to kids growing up way back then.<br />But these days, I'm afraid, that no longer applies - Trout Mask Replica is a cacophonous, pointless, redundant mess. Cacophonous &amp; pointless because quite deliberately it was intended to sound that way; redundant because thirty odd years down the line, there's nothing new in being deliberately nonsensical, off-key, out of tune, arhythmic and whacky - and it is nonsensical, off-key, out of tune, arhythmic whackiness which fills up this double album to the brim. Nothing on this record is pleasant or worthwhile to listen to. People like Beck and Tom Waits have been developing bettering the original idea for years. In fairness, it was Captain Beefheart's idea. But it was just an idea.<br />Like a true classic, this is one of those albums everyone wants to have listened to, but no-one wants to listen to it now -except the throng of devotees; the same poor souls who wear out the fanbelts on their turntables with Umma Gumma.<br />Well, friends, you can have it.t no-one wants to listen to it now -except the throng of devotees; the same poor souls who wear out the fanbelts on their turntables with Umma Gumma.<br />Well, friends, you can have it.

0553573403|2.0|I'm obviously one of the very few fantasy fans who didn't like this book based on the other reviews I've read for this book.  Something about this book just didn't work for me, however.<br />Most of the reviews detail the realistic characters and numerous plot twists as one of the great things about this book, but that's what I saw as this book's downfall.<br />I found myself disliking if not flat out despising nearly every character in this book.  Every one of them had serious flaws, be it that they were flat-out scumbags, selfish nobles, or just too dense to do what they should.  This may be realistic, but I guess I read fantasy looking to enjoy the story of a hero, not to follow along as character after character shows they're not worthy of being a hero.<br />The number of plot twists left me a little bewildered too.  I found myself struggling to keep everything in perspective, as characters I thought were going to be part of the main story suddenly died, leaving me wondering what just happened and why.  Was I misreading the earlier part of the book by thinking they were better than they turned out to be?  Maybe if I could have forced myself to continue the series it would have made more sense, but after reading this book, I just kind of felt like I couldn't bear any more frustration.<br />So I'd have to say, be very careful if you decide to read this book.  You'll see tons of reviews that declare this book and it's follow-ups to be the greatest there is in fantasy literature.  Just be prepared to lose numerous characters you liked, and not enough of the ones you didn't, along the way.  It's easily the most realistic book I've read in the fantasy genre (that was good enough to make me finish the book, any way), but that doesn't make it the best by any stretch.
0875428940|3.0|There is a lot to like about this deck. The illustrations are colorful and clear, and Robin Wood has kept the symbolism of traditional Tarot decks while still managing to make her deck unique. I particularly appreciate her interpretation of the Death card, which I feel more strongly represents the true meaning of the card as one of change and renewal while still reminding the reader that there can be no rebirth without death.<br />This is a deck that speaks pretty well to me; however, I have noticed that after time, my connection to these cards isn't as strong as it used to be. For some time, I haven't been able to put my finger on the reason, but after reading the reviews on the deck, I think it has to do with the main negative that I've noticed: the faces in the deck, despite its pagan leanings, do look overwhelmingly WASP-y. And, as one reviewer put it, the deck has a distinctive \\"shiny, happy people\\" look. To me, it's a mistake to play up only the positive aspects of paganism/Wicca, as these cards do. To do so ignores an important fact: Nature does indeed nurture, but she also destroys. For that reason, more mature readers and collectors may find this deck rather weak, as I have discovered I do. Not to say that it still doesn't speak to me; it just doesn't do so with the power of other decks.
0345350499|1.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I haven't even finished the book. that's how dumb it is. Maybe I hate it cuz I'm only 13, but I have a high reading level, so its not that this book is too hard, its too boring. Here's a summary.<br />  At the begining, Morgaine's mom falls in love with a guy even though she's married. Her husband dies, she and the guy have a kid who's Arthur. Morgaine gets sent to Avalon to be a priestess and meets Lancelot and falls in love. Morgaine ends up having a kid w/ her brother, but she doesn't know that he's her brother. Lancelot is in love with Gwenevier who's married to Arthur, but still flirts with Morgaine and plays with her emotions. Gwenevier is baiscially a barbie because she's an air head that's afraid to be outside walls, even in the courtyard she's freaked.<br />  The book is the most horrible one on the planet. Don't read it unless you like being bored. Trust me, it isn't worth your time.
B0000029DD|5.0|What can you say about Jeff Buckley? Well, how about that he was the greatest loss to music since John Lennon was killed!He has the ability to take your soul to places only God himself should beable to speak of. Hopefully, we'll all hear the whispered words that this artist spoke of without effort. Jeff, wherever you are, I'm forever in your debt.If you only buy one record this year, make sure it's Grace!!!The world lost a singer that no other can ever replace!This recording touches lives!
B000002HMH|5.0|I'm really amazed that this album is getting such little respect from people. Metallica fan or not, it seems like everyone likes to bash Load and Reload because it's commonly accepted that they're inferior albums. <br />Personally, I feel that \\"Load\\" contains Metallica's best work. James' singing is finally deeper and more tuned, no longer the wimpy, screechy voice heard on \\"Ride The Lightning.\\" He's got dynamic range on every song, and it his other bandmates show that they've grown as musicians aswell. The songs are also much less epic than the ones from \\"Master of Puppets,\\" which suited me just fine.<br />What's the problem with Metallica settling on a more straight-up rock sound? There isn't one. They sound better than ever on \\"Load,\\" and I'd take this kind of style any day over the fairly lame \\"Ride The Lightning.\\" Songs like Until It Sleeps, Hero of the Day, and Bleeding Me are very well paced songs, and their actually deeper than most people give them credit for.<br />Ignore the whining of the previous reviewers who bashed this album. They're all stuck in some time warp where speed metal is still \\"badass and cool.\\" Maybe they're just upset because Metallica decided to grow up before they did. BUY THIS.
B00000064E|5.0|Nick Drake was one of the most beautiful song wrtiters of the last thirty years! He belongs among names like Jeff Buckley and John lennon. His music has changed my life and the lives of all my friends that i have turned on to him. I'm forever greatful for every song and album, and will never be the same again because of it!! Thank you Nick! matt@ artstudenttheband.com
B000003S16|2.0|Very simply, it's Fripp's most interesting album and the one in my collection that makes my hair stand on end. But in the process of transferring it to CD, it was butchered. There is a full minute and a half on music missing from the album, as well as Fripp's acerbic wit on some of the songs (esp. Haaden Two) and the most fasceted instrument lines were also eliminated from the album, like the missing echo from &quot;here comes the flood&quot;, the synthesizer line from &quot;NY3&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. In the end it was given the same rotten treatment that they gave to Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Tusk&quot;, an equally diverse and experimental album. Both CD's should be avoided like the plague. My best advice is just to get an LP Player and enjoy the vinyl.
B00005JKED|1.0|I found the movie itself to be horrible - no plot, no closure, no anything.
B00005LQ04|4.0|Well I rented this movie the day that I turned 16.<BR>I was allowed to watch horror films before that<BR>but I couldn´t go and rent it nor could I be 100 % sure<BR>that I would be led into the movies or not.<BR>In december I saw this limited edition and bought it. I know it was a bit expensive. the film was excellent. Maybe the<BR>problem was that some dialouges in the film suffered from bad<BR>sound qualities but that didn´t make different. the 2nd disc is great and third which features the score is good to. On the disc you could find also a music video (which is terrible and the most laughable video you´ll ever see in your entire life. And I think it was made in 2001.) The film you don´t have to say it and the documentry excellent. There is just one problem. it is missing subtitles. I wanted to se the italian version but there seemed to be missing English subtitles. So if you don´t speak or understand italian you could only see the English version (It was shot on many different languages but the original language for the film was English). <br />But rent the movie before buying the DVD. Because not everyone likes it. And this version. I hope this isn´t to late because there are not many copies left.
B000002L9Y|3.0|Having coaxed the reluctant Lindsey Buckingham into doing one more album, but without the full presence of a rehabbing Stevie Nicks, this might be more \\"Lindsey's Folly\\" than Tusk was. Again taking the rough songs offered by the others and polishing them to diamondesque brilliance, Buckingham makes this album a masterwork as ONLY he can, as evidenced by his sonically similiar solo Out of the Cradle. I have ALWAYS though Buckingham and Christime McVie's voices played off each other so well, so like Lennon and McCartney's did, and with Nicks pretty much out of this album, they really shine through. Not to say that Nicks' tracks are toss offs either; \\"When I See You Again\\" is one of the most haunting songs ever committed to vinyl.<br />The songs... well, they're Fleetwood Mac... the songs are middle of the road, fairly safe [what is now] Adult Contemporary. There's multi layered vocals and guitars all over the place, though keyboards are more prominent than other albums. There's nothing adventurous or dangerous here, though there's some dark moments (\\"Caroline\\", the title track and the afformentioned Nicks track). If anything you might be turned off by the sick sweetness of \\"Everywhere\\" or \\"You and I Pt II.\\" It's a GOOD album, but it's not a groundbreaker like the first three by this lineup. First and foremost, this was Lindsey's gem and crowning achievment as a PRODUCER for Fleetwood Mac (equalled, I say again, only by his Out of the Cradle). Unfortuanely for the Mac, it might have proved to Buckingham what he could do, and it would be over a decade before this cast of Fleetwood Mac would be reunited.
B0000025RI|4.0|Hm. I wasn´t even born when this album was released and I missed<BR>the whole phenomenon surrounding this album. <br />But I do know the whole story. This album had 7 top 10 singels<BR>recieved 8 grammy´s and has sold more than 50 milion copies etc.<br />When this album was released it was somewhat revolution. It was a follow from the fantastic album Off the Wall wich was another<BR>revolution. This album made history. It contained songs and<BR>video´s that never had been seen before and it was big it was so big. But now after nearly 20 years since it´s release Is it still worth buying the album. Well maybe. I bought it after last summer<BR>and I had already listened to the singels a thosound times<BR>and the samples but I hadn´t sit down and listened to the album entirely because I didn´t like and still don´t like Michael Jackson that much. <br />The album starts with WANNA BE STARTING SOMETHING. the song was a smash and I can see why. But after listening to the album I though to myself. This is not going on my top 20 list of the best album I have ever listened to. Because it´s not. <br />The album is somewhat what represented the period. Everybody ought to have that album. Like MARIAH CAREY´s Music box . Everybody should have owned the album. This album is really good but not great. You may call it masterpiece but not the greatest album ever. <br />In my opinion this is his 2nd best effort. Best being Off the Wall. I kind a expected more. But it is really good but don´t believe the entire hype. <br />Thank for Reading
B00003Q43A|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater originally and had a decent memory of it.  It was a fun summer movie and the special effects were great.  So when this two DVD THX version came out, I bought a copy.  I wish I had stuck with my memories, because it is such a cheesy movie watching it now, almost six years later.<br />The special effects are still decent, but can't really compare with what they do nowadays.  And since the special effects can no longer compensate for the screenplay (or lack thereof),  there is really nothing to the movie, even watching it from a purely entertainment standpoint.<br />Giving the movie every benefit of the doubt possible, there are still so many things that make it virtually unwatchable.  Here are just a couple:<br />-- The acting is just so shallow and non-passionate.  Millions of people die when the aliens destroy entire cities, yet the cast, including the supposed President of the U.S. (a poorly cast Bill Pullman) is on a plane joking around hours later with no apparent sadness for what happened.<br />-- Scientists have been studying an alien spaceship at Area 51 for 40 years, yet Jeff Goldblum (in the same role he played in Jurassic Park) is able to come in, decipher the ship's secrets, and get the ship ready to fly in 24 hours.<br />-- Will Smith steals a helicopter when he finds out his hometown is destroyed (and thus his girlfriend and girlfriend's son), and manages to land within 50 yards of where his girlfriend has survived and camped out (and coincidentally found the first lady of the U.S. on the side of what used to be a road)<br />-- The part about planting a computer virus in the mother ship isn't even worth mentioning.<br />In summary, I would recommend that if you have good memories of this movie from when it came out, please leave them as good memories and don't ruin them by watching this movie again.  I wish I had this advice.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Today I wen´t to see Crossroads. It was not that bad.<BR>It contained though bad acting and not very good script<BR>but it had it´s moments. Ok here is the album which was released<BR>in november. Like the other Britney Spears album this one<BR>has sold about 12 milion copies or something so far<BR>but does that mean that the album is good. I don´t know<BR>I don´t think that this album would become classic it sold<BR>the first weeks really well but then it disapears from the charts<BR>after bearly a year. Anyway. The album is like the typical teenyboopper album. It contains 13 tracks written by Hitmakers and sung by the star. The 13 track are between 3-4 minutes long and all sound a bit similar. Listen I am not judging Britney herself. I mean it´s unbelievable how see has acoplished on such<BR>short period of time...Her vocals are bad. She try´s though but her voice isn´t good.<BR>The lyrics are something that a 12 year old or younger could have written. If she´s gonna exspress herself she needs to put it on a paper like people would write it not say it...The album itself sounds cheep. The cover and the art. I mean there is no feeling. This album isn´t personal enough to be called a breaktrough album (not commercially but critically).<BR>It so much of the same pop. Most of the songs aren´t even written originally The producer somewhat writes the song so the songwriter is mainly the person who writes the lyrics. <br />The album is somewhat catchy and has it´s moments but it´s no<BR>masterpiece and is no 5 star album. I recomend you to listen to the samples or burn it before buying a copy. Then you can decide<BR>whether you think it´s worthy...I think Britney 15 minutes are not up but I don´t think she<BR>will be forever...

B0000010IS|1.0|I am so upset that you didn't have the correct sound track that i was looking for. I love the Moive fear w/(Mark W.) I was looking for this one song that they have in there. Who ever is looking for the sound track be carful and do not perchase this sound tract unless you know the songs that you are looking for.
B00005IC2H|5.0|There are no words for describing this cd. Some people say music can't change anymore but this is a proof of different. With this cd Sigur Ros made it evident to see that music can evolve. Sit down and relax, enjoy. You'll be trasported to wherever you want to feel good. Interesting guitar playing, amazing angelical voices and great ambience tunes just make this a perfect cd. Svefn G or Hjartad are the ones to look for in the first place. I can't wait for their next cd!
B000060MMI|4.0|There should be a four and a half star rating. <BR>Undoubtedly this album rages. The first three songs are punishing; \\"Drunken Lullabies\\", the title track, is one of those you must memorize the lyrics to and sing along with. \\"What's Left of the Flag\\" is another excellent tune, but \\"May The Living Be Dead (In Our Wake) is my favorite. \\"If I Ever Leave This World Alive\\" is my favorite Dave King song on the album; it shows that questioning, mellow side of his lyrical talent that is part of what made \\"Worst Day Since Yesterday\\" such a great tune. <BR>Songs \\"The Kilburn High Road\\", \\"Rebels of the Sacred Heart\\", and \\"Swagger\\" are straight-up furious punk Molly style. <BR>I'm not sure what they were thinking with \\"Cruel Mistress\\", letting Nathan Maxwell sing and all. It's a funny song, but his voice is not nearly as strong or commanding as King's. Maybe Noel Redding put him up to this....<BR>\\"Death Valley Queen\\" is a beautifully textured tune; when King laments that \\"I..have always..loved you..\\" I feel a tear jerk the corner of my eye....<BR>\\"The Rare Ould Times\\" is a gorgeous Pete St. John song that Flogging Molly couldn't have done more justice to. It's my favorite song on the album. <BR>\\"The Sun Never Shines..\\" is another mournful tune reminscent of \\"Far Away Boys\\". If I had to guess I would say \\"The Sun\\" seems to be addressed to Dave's mother...interesting.... <br />Buy this album. You will not regret it. And if you don't have Swagger, buy that too. If I had to choose, I would choose Swagger, but Drunken Lullabies more than worth it as well. And see them LIVE! I saw them in Anaheim...awesome!
B000006NPY|5.0|Since its release, I have always enjoyed Adore and its hushed tone.  However, for those people who feel the album lacked power (as in guitar power), I would have suggested seeing the Pumpkins during their tour for the album.  I saw them in Atlanta during the tour and the songs were completely beefed up.  Shame and Blank Page were begun with lilting piano solos only to have the guitars come crashing in.  Moreover, the songs were extended to lengths of 9 and ten minutes with feedback laden solos.  It was an incredible sound because I was expecting more acoustic driven sounds.  It appeared the audience was in awe too.  So while I can understand people's need for the hard rock...I respect the Pumpkins for their decision to release a moody, quiet record.  If you want the noise, pick up a bootleg of that show and SP will prove to you that they can transform any song of theirs into a rocking masterpiece.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|I am a big fan of movie soundtracks. I either have bought almost every existing soundtrack on vinyl or CD or have heard them. I've been buying sondtrack albums since I was 14, and that was back in the 70s. However, upon listening to this particular collection of music, I was absolutely amazed that such a conglomeration of mixed-up trash could actually make its way to a feature film about the Moulin Rouge at the turn of the century. Some of the instrumental music from the film is inspired and different, and I would've liked to have seen more of the original songs like \\"Come What May\\", but the rest of the modern pop entries just do not fit into a musical, especially a \\"period\\" musical. I know a lot of people really like this kind of anachronistic stuff, but it simply does not work, and I just wish Hollywood would stop churning out this garbage.
0060254920|5.0|Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are is a wonderfully presented story for children.  The tale focuses on an apparently rowdy youth, Max, who is sent to bed without supper for his rambunctious escapades in the house.  Later that night Max dreams of a magical rowdy world where he is king of all things wild and terrible, but eventually Max comes to realize that having everything always go your way lacks any real fulfillment.  The incorporation of some values into a beautifully illustrated adventure is sure to entertain any small child while still effectively presenting a subtle message.  Thus, a child is not confused, nor presented with a meaningless tale.  The pictures have been recognized worldwide and have been presented with the prestigious Caldicott Award for illustrations in children's books.  This book is printed in hardcover, a bonus for when handling is to be done by children, and the font is large and separated from pictures to avoid confusion.  The author's connection of the textual story to the pictoral story is helpful for children learning to read as well, as it helps to form associations between pictures and words.  Widely recognized as a classic, Where the Wild Things Are is a necessity for any small child's library.

B000002AGY|5.0|This is simply a wonderful jazz recording.  I bought the LP when it was first issued many years ago and it is one of my treasures.  Really, the artists on &quot;Concierto&quot; make up what I consider to be a jazz supergroup.  Just imagine if you could  see these guys in concert, today...Jim Hall, Chet Baker, Paul Desmond, Roland Hanna and Ron Carter!  The mind boggles.<br />I have to rate &quot;Concierto&quot; five star because of the wonderful music.  The sound is good but, IMHO, it could be better (the vinyl is).  I hope someone will reissue the CD using the latest remastering technology.<br />Bottom line...if you like any one of these great jazz virtuosos, you need this CD.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was anxious to say the least about seeing Baz Luhrmann's \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" Based on what I had seen in the trailers, it looked to be a really delicious piece of film making. But, as I sat in the darkened theater, I quickly became aware that I was not totally prepared for the inspired vision that was about to unfold. <br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" is nothing short of dazzling, a wild-eyed, acid trip of a movie, that looks and sounds like nothing you've ever seen before. The first 45 minutes of this reinvented musical are a dizzying blur that will leave you gasping to catch your breath. It's like being grabbed up by the seat of your pants and hurled through a cartoon, cardboard cutout of Paris, (circa 1900). It is at the same time garish, bawdy, and beautiful, sort of like riding a terrifying thrill ride, at 100 miles per hour and the minute it's over you want to run to get back in line, to ride it again.<br />The story is a classic opera tale that centers around the characters Christian, a penniless writer, played with class and style by Ewan McGregor, and Satine, the beautiful star, and courtesan of the fabled \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" played by gorgeous Nicole Kidman. The incredible scenes between Ewan and Nicole literally light up the screen with love and excitement. They sing... they dance and they do both damn well! It's pure joy watching these two forbidden lovers cavort across the star lit sky, literally singing with the moon of their secret love.<br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" features some great contemporary songs by Elton John, \\"Your Song,\\" Madonna, \\"Like A Virgin,\\" and Sting, \\"Roxanne,\\" all reinterpreted into some of the most eye-popping musical production numbers put on film since the 1940's. The entire supporting cast-of-characters, including a fabulous performance by Jim Broadbent, add just the right balance to round out this loopy, lopsided kaleidoscope of a movie. <br />I have seen a lot of musicals over the years, some great, some not so great, but I don't believe I have ever seenone that has affected me in such an odd way as \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" This wonderful film has broken the tired old mold of movie musicals and given it a vibrant, shinny new life, and quite frankly, that's a very good thing! <br />The DVD is incredible, with enough behind the scenes features, to keep you happy for hours. This one is a must for your collection.
B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes are a good rock band influenced by late 70's/early 80's punk. They are fresh and exciting and it's good to really enjoy a new CD that sounds somewhat like old school punk. Although they are not as good as The Stooges and VU (circa White Heat/White Light, Nico [is not good]) you can't blame them for critics saying they were just like them. ... Standout tracks are \\"Is This It,\\" \\"Soma,\\" and \\"Hard To Explain.\\" Buy it if you like it but first download some of their music to get a taste for them.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Great movie! Even some people who haven't read the books will like this. Should buy!
B000003TAW|5.0|Making music that is catchy and easier to listen then most alt. rock groups, but alternative enough that it can't be called pop music, Weezer released a brilliant debut album. On this album Rivers Cuomo's voice harmonizes with other members while being backed by distorted guitar chords and bluesy solos. The songs are all different yet they have the same sound to each. With only 10 tracks, this album goes by quickly so you don't get bored all the tracks. With acoustic guitar intros and deep sounding guitar solos, the album shines as a breakthrough album for Weezer and music in general in the 90's. I'm normally a fan of more ska-punk  bands like Rancid and The Clash. This album is one of the greatest cd's ever released. If you normally like punk or hardcore, this is a good cd to buy because it is influenced by late 70's punk. If you like the Pixies this album is heavily influenced by then. If you like just good music you should buy this album. Personally I don't like Pinkerton because of its electronic influences and the Green Album is a pop record because lately Weezer has become very popular with MTV watchers. If you want real Weezer music buy this album and this album only. It will keep you listening to it for a long time.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K.'s I GET WET is easily one of the greatest albums to have been released in the last five years, though I would admit it is not for all tastes.  Critics who suggest that this record is dumb, reckless or monotonous have missed the point (and have probably not given the album a thorough listen).  With I GET WET, Andrew W.K. has found the common thread between Van Halen, early Black Flag, Gary Glitter and Slayer.  He is not a joke and his is not a schtick. His &quot;partying&quot; is not the cokefest, promiscous cavorting some would assume, but rather the abstract ideal of doing whatever floats your boat and living for today.  Each song on this album is a call to arms, an anthem for going for the gold and a paean to conquering the universe.  Every track bleeds and every song is a highlight.  Do yourself a favor and don't miss the boat!
B000002AP1|5.0|Before Iggy became the \\"lust for life\\" Iggy Pop he did something much greater. The Stooges are to me one of the best bands ever. They had the nihilism of any punk band with the charisma of The Doors, plus all this in a time when Woodstock just happened and \\"flower plower\\" was at full throttle. What a great time for a band like The Stooges to appear. A band that sang about ideas apposite to the loving, peaceful ideas of the hippies. A band that made people wake up and realize there's no such thing as free love and world peace. The Stooges were a group of musicians who saved Rock N' Roll at a time when it was about to die. With huge grossing hippie groups like Jimi Hendrix Experience and the Jefferson Airplane, The Stooges rebelled against the mainstream and came from a local angry Detroit band like the MC5 to a nationally known band. Whether you like or dislike The Stooges, you have to respect them. They were The Sex Pistols of the late 60's. The rebellious band that changed Rock N' Roll forever and set the stage for bands like the great Ramones to start the punk movement. Without The Stooges there would be no punk movement. Although Joey Ramone is the \\"father of punk,\\" the then known Iggy Stooge is the \\"godfather of punk.\\" This whole album is a fast almost 40 minute that established The Stooges as the true kings of \\"Proto-Punk\\" (along with the MC5 and The New York Dolls.) There is not one track on this album that I can't listen to. With Iggy's raw scratchy vocals, to the crisp fast guitar \\"solos\\" if you will call them that, the CD goes by quicker than the alloted time. With fast nihilstic songs like \\"Search and Destroy\\" to slower more thought out songs like \\"I Need Somebody\\" (which I consider the best song on the album) this album is essential to any Rock N' Roll lover, punk, or metalhead. BUY THIS NOW ALONG WITH THE TWO OTHER STOOGES ALBUMS.
B00000IGGA|5.0|This is my first Tom Waits CD.  I think I heard one of his songs at the end of a movie, and on a lark, selected it from many others in a stack.  There's a wide variety of music here, both vocal and instrumental.  Waits is not afraid to experiment.  There are pieces on this CD that are gutsy and humorous, some grating, and some are just sublime.  Take for instance, &quot;Take it with me,&quot; which sweetly begs the question, What will you take with you when you go?  Then there's &quot;Georgia Lee&quot; with sadness that runs so deep and so true. While I didn't like a few pieces at first, they have even started to grow on me now.  This man is a true artist who invites you to peer deeply within.  If you haven't heard of Tom Waits before and you like a rich mix of poetry and music, then by all means, buy it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant and visually stunning films for years. David Fincher's masterpiece deserves more recognition. This is a deep and clever dark film. I know this because Tyler knows this.<BR>And to all those narrow-minded, whinging people that go &quot;Oh, but is sooo violent. How can we as a society eat up this voilence...blah blah blah voilence&quot; - shut up. Can't you recognise the need for catharsis? To make us all complete? Can you grasp the message? If you haven't seen this film then see it. If you have, see it again.
B00005JKED|5.0|Believe everything you've heard about this film. The acting is superb. Denzel Washington plays Alonzo Harris, a scheming corrupt cop who pushes a rookie, Jake (Ethan Hawke) over the edge on his \\"training day.\\" Yes, Denzel deserved the Oscar he is devious, sly, and psychotic. He is truly a wolf in wolf's clothing in this role. The viewer isn't quite sure what to make of Alonzo until far into the film. We know he's not good, but you'll never suspect some of the plot twists that turn up in this one. Ethan Hawke outshines Washington in the performance of his career, playing a naive rookie cop who is all but the anti-thesis of Alonzo Harris. Jake still believes that cops can make a difference and does his job to the letter of the law, in the end it's what winds up saving him. Training Day is a long film but the time is needed to unfold the multi-layered plot and adequately endear the audience to it's central characters. Overall, a well made thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat propelled by two of the most memorable performances of the last decade. Highly Recommended.
0792842499|5.0|In some part towards the end of this film a cowboy with a single arm catches Tuco to retaliate, but instead of instantly shooting at Tuco he starts to speak, and because he has started to do so, Tuco finds an opportunity to draw his gun before he fires first and shoots at his rival. Then he says \\"If you'll shoot, shoot; don't talk!\\"  which is the most appropriate sentence for that case, and so is the every other part of the film all well thought and all with a sense. Everything from the scenario to the selection of the artists... It's not a coincidence that it became so successful. And it's one of the most immitated movies I've seen, too, but I think that helps to shows its difference from the ordinary films. That's why I bought it and it is one of the just five VHS's I've bought so far.
B00000DRA9|4.0|The soundtrack to THE NEVERENDING STORY really is an enjoyable listening experience.  I remember watching the film when I was younger, and I recall how much I enjoyed the fantasy and mystery of the story.  Listening to the various songs and musical pieces was a nostalgic experience.  For those who have seen the film, I'm sure that you'll also be able to visualize the different scenes in which each song is attached.  Some of my favorites were track #6 (Bastian's Happy Flight), #8 (Atreju's Quest), #9 (Theme of Sadness), and #14 (The Auryn).  The woodwind/flute in the &quot;Theme of Sadness&quot; has a very full, and haunting sound.  And &quot;Bastian's Happy Flight,&quot; as well as &quot;Atreju's Quest,&quot; have an exciting momentum to them.  &quot;The Auryn&quot; includes a nice choral-like arrangement, which brings the listener to the end of the journey.  I recommend this soundtrack to those who would like to spend a few moments in the enchanted land of THE NEVERENDING STORY.
6305508550|4.0|This movie ranks right up there with some of my most favorite comedies.  Definitely one that I'll watch over and over again.
B00005QIPH|5.0|OK, let's put all of the comparisons aside for a second. Forget The Velvets, Television, whoever, the point is, The Strokes are a great rock group. I have been waiting for a long time to hear some good music. I'm fifteen-years-old and I've had to go back to the '60s, '70's, and '80s to find music that's worthwhile listening to (The Doors, The Eagles, Guns N' Roses, etc.) so I was psyched when The Strokes came out with \\"Is This It\\". Sure, it's not exactly mind-expanding, it's not life-changing, it won't change your perspective on music, but it will make you grab the nearest hairbrush and sing along to songs like \\"Last Nite\\", \\"Barely Legal\\" and \\"Hard to Explain\\". And what's wrong with comparisons anyway? When The Ramones came out they had songs that sounded like they came out of the '50's, but they managed to create their own sound as well, and I think that's what The Strokes have attempted to do, and in my opinion they've succeeded at doing that. For people who haven't heard this CD, The Strokes sound like a mix between Cheap Trick, Blondie, and The Kinks. Julian Casablancas has the coolest singing style in the world and the band in general is just so different from anyone out there right now, and believe me, I'm not a big fan of the bands that end up on TRL, but these guys are an exception and \\"Is This It\\" is definately one of my Top 5 favorite albums. If you're not a jaded, cynical, and snobby music critic, than you'll love this CD.
B00005221L|5.0|This is by far my favorite action film ever made. I'm no so sure it should be considered a sci-fi film, (yes I'm aware the title character is an alien but) since there's little actual science to this film, and the Predator only uses a (sci-fi-esque) shoulder mounted laser cannon (AKA: Plasma Caster, Shoulder Cannon, SHOULDER GUN OF DOOM!) only a couple times, outside of that the Predator seems to be really as down and dirty as any of the 'humans' in the film, not counting his Cloaking device. While the story line doesn't hold up to scrutiny and the characters are somewhat stereotypical, this film is so good because it has so much action right off the bat, a huge shoot out with a terrorist camp all within the first 30 minutes or so. In most movies the type of battle that took place in the first half of the film would have been the final crescendo peice. But not this movie, after the big shoot out the trained rescue squad takes one a prisoner and try to make their way back across the border, too bad for them, their actions caught they eye of an intergalactic hunter and it's not long before he starts picking them off one by one.<br />By the end, as you may have guess, Ahnuld is all alone in the jungle with the huge hulking beast, normally Arnold is the \\"huge hulking beast\\" in the movie, it was really interesting to see Arnold take on something thats bigger, tougher, seemingly smarter and a whole heck of a lot meaner than him. I think this is one of Mr. Schwarzeneggers better 'acting' performances, he truly lookes terrified of the Predator, of course Arnold will play it off modestly and say he was truly afraid of it but well I still think the acting is really good. <br />The Predator creature design, I think, is one of the best movie monsters/characters ever made along the lines of Alien and Pumpkinhead. Stan Winston origionally had a more 'insect' like creature design but it was later recommended by James Cameron that the design be switched to the current one for scarepurposes.<br />Now I've told you all about the movie and it's title character now lets talk about the dvd. The price for this disc seems to have jumped a couple bucks in the last month, why? I can't say. But this is a bare bones DVD and I feel it is currently over priced. I got mine for... significantly less...and I still felt I got jipped. The sound is well done, it could stand to have a new master of the sound. It comes with the theatrical trailer, which I thought was cool, but I, myself, am a hardcore Alien and Predator fan and if you are too you will know why the trailer is so neat. You should save you money up for the 2 disc \\"Special Edition\\" that should be realeased some time...
B00004Z459|5.0|this cd is definantly the best one ever made or at least the best one iv ever heard,i like it because its really hard to put in a group of music. its hard because it has a little bit of everything, metal,hip-hop,rap,rock, and so on.i know this as fact because every time i see this cd in a store it always has a different title for the group of music it's in.Sometimes its heavy metal, othertimes its hard rock and hip-hop, i think people need to just stop tring to put this new kind of music in a group and just call it what it it, Linkin Park.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This film was fantastic, it was recommended to me by an online friend so the next day I headed out and rented it and it was one of the biggest shocks I have ever had from renting a film. It shocked me because it was so good, after reading a couple plot out lines I figured all I would have to look foreward to was the cool sounding creatures. To my great suprise it turned out this film offered a fun story, great characters, some of the best special effects I have seen in a very long time and yes, Riddick. <br />Riddick (Vin Diesel) is the main protagonist of the film, he is an escaped convict and multiple murderer, who somehow, turns out to be the most likeable character in the film. After seeing this film Vin Diesel became one of my favorite actors. Also this film featured some other pretty interesting characters, who I can't really describe without spoiling the film. But Johns (Cole Hauser) was very interesting and I think was kind of missed or forgotten due to Vin Diesels great character. I would say, had Riddick not been SO cool Johns would have became somewhat of a cult hero.<br />And the beasties, I refer to them as Raptors, are some of the coolest movie monsters I have seen in quite some time as well. Especially the POV shots from them, a visual interpretation of what echolocation looks like. And you see many stages of life for these creatures as well, from baby &quot;hatchlings&quot; to full grown adults or &quot;big boys&quot;. The portrayal of these creatures is strikingly realistic. They're in my top 5 best movie monsters list. <br />As for the DVD, this seemed to be more promising than it turned out to be. I expected much more gore in the &quot;unrated&quot; version but there was very little extra blood and guts, it mostly just featured more stuff that was probably cut for time constraints. The commentary was really good too, David Twohy, Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser all on the same track, it was pretty funny when they told stories from the set and funny little happenings around the set and things. The rest of the features, I felt, were some what lacking, Raveworld thing, it seemed to have nothing to do with the film at all. Cast and Crew bios were kinda lacking as well.<br />All in all, buy this version instead of the &quot;R&quot; rated version just because theres some fun new footage, but don't buy it because you think theres more gore or anything, there really isn't.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Platoon, Full Metal Jacket...These movies show the side of veitnam we americans have been shown since grade school..a lost war.  The war we lost.  Well not anymore.  It's about time a vietnam movie was made that show the world what happened in that war, not just the bad.  The air cavalry, men and women that brought hope to every soldier in the field.  Gibson is not only heroic, but inspirational.  The violence was not overly used.  It showed the real face of war.  Those boys died defending their position and all we can think of vietnam is what a tragedy we lost it.  The soliders won their war, it was the nation as a whole that lost.  Lost because of lack of ideals.  The end of the movie brings one thing to my mind, besides tears..The picture most of you have seen in malls and thought nothing of..The executive with his hand on the vietnam wall with his fallen brothers on the other side of that wall with their hands raised to meet the one of them that is still alive.  Col. Moore is not only a leader of the 7th calvary, but is a hero to all men who bleed and died for a country that did not give a [darn] about them...and a hero to me as well...God bless America!
B00005JH7D|5.0|In an interview, I do believe Marcus Miller outlined the &quot;themes&quot; of this album as Power and Grace.  These themes, essentially the opening and closing songs, perfectly outline his newest solo CD in 7 years.  Marcus Miller draws from both his own original compositions as well as those of greats like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane to create a powerful, yet graceful display of his incredible skill and passion for music.  Though his technical prowess may first amaze, his music will reveal many layers of complexity and depth through many listens.  Fun and energetic (&quot;Power&quot; and &quot;Nikki's Groove&quot;), while soft and beautiful (&quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot; and &quot;Your Amazing Grace&quot;), this album will surely please.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I was a ten year old when I first heard songs from Tapestry.  Thirty years later they still sound contemporary, and can hold their own against the current genre of alternative music from Morissette ang Imbruglia.
B00004STPT|5.0|Throughout the movie &quot;Gladiator,&quot; Hanz Zimmer's compositions are powerful when need be, and soft and beautiful when need be.  The emotion of such a great movie is finely captured in this soundtrack.  Lisa Gerrard's mysterious yet beautiful voice perfectly captures and portrays the emotions of the film.  For lovers of the movie, and even just regular fans, this CD is well worth a listen.
B000002VQQ|5.0|...piano drowns in it's own reverb, the music dark like a high mass, aural incense lay heavy as the speaker cones come to life, the black cat of the old blues parts it's teeth and moans...<BR>   &quot;...jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine...&quot;<BR>the group  joins the catfight, slowly at first, then the wheels roll harder, the wagon rocks, and the rickety creature of strats and drums and thunderbird bass props up and propels the cracked mirror snarls and sweetnothings the singer sings, taking the ancient chant of the sanctified garage, &quot;Gloria&quot;, into history.<br />    With &quot;Horses&quot;, the Patti Smith Group created a moment in time and sound that we should all strive toward, the purity of both their art and their rock and roll, and the balance struck between the two is a rarity in pop music. The music on &quot;Horses&quot; drives and swoops and undulates and screams and comforts and terrorizes and informs and confuses, it blesses the intellect, the broken or soaring heart, the sacred and the depraved spirit, the hungering body and the bootyshake gland.<BR>    Fronted by a black leather scarecrow/mary magdalenic genius, alternately weeping and crowing her words of spite, faith, pride, regret and redemption looking for all the world like Keith Richards' fictional little sister, the Patti Smith Group (Lenny Kaye, Ivan Kral, Jay Dee Daugherty and Richard Sohl)created an album of timeless grace and savage beauty. Like John Lennon's &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; before it, &quot;Horses&quot; is a record that can hold you in it's arms and let you know that, for all your dark failings and in spite of all the secrets that make it hard to sleep sometimes, it's alright...you're alright.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Though a must have for electric (fretless) bass players, many will enjoy Jaco Pastorius's solo debut.  His amazing technique and intonation is coupled with his beautiful composition skills to create wonderful pieces.  My personal favorites are &quot;Portrait of Tracy&quot; and &quot;Continuum.&quot;  However, some may find his music to be out of their taste.  The music's focus is on the fretless bass guitar, and the opening track (and others) may seem boring or bland for lack of accompaniment.  Once one begins listening, it becomes very easy to appreciate Jaco's tremendous skill, and understand the influence he holds to this day.
B00000637V|5.0|\\"Berlin\\" is an unflinching look inti the darkest corners of the human soul/psyche. Over stunning orchestration and stellar production (by Bob Ezrin, who is for some reason more famous for producing \\"The Wall\\" than \\"Berlin\\") Lou Reed, the voice of cool neutrality, submits for our approval (or rejection, i somehow think it's all the same to Lou, and that our feelings and opinions matter not) the starkly delineated tale of two expatriate speedfreaks living in Berlin, and how they torture each other in a spiritually bankrupt vacuum of tympanis and violins, ghost choruses of sick angels and science-fiction doowop, and how the torture of ownership as love and s/m junkiedom leads inexorably to death. In this case her suicide is of course a literal death, but as the male half of this diseased equation wraps himself in the bloody sheets of her deathbed and declares himself good because \\"somebody else would have broken both of her arms\\", then we are left with the sound of the death of a spirit, the wasting of a soul, a sad song indeed.<BR>     For your listening pleasure? <BR>     The \\"Citizen Kane\\" of rock and roll. It's that simple.
0385503954|5.0|Ian McEwan's Atonement is ostensibly the story of young writer Briony Tallis's need for the kind of control that places her at the center of her small world. And so, when she finds herself able to supply an accounting of events that will determine the future of a number of people, can she resist doing so?    <BR>     Eleven-year-old Briony has written a morality drama in honor of her older brother's visit to the family home and is impatient to begin rehearsals with three young cousins who are to live with the family for an unspecified time.  Alas, the cousins prove unruly as cast members (one even usurps Briony's leading role) and she rejects drama (the genre in which characters speak in their own voices) to return to fiction.    Fiction, after all, is controlled by the narrative voice, Briony's voice, and she exercises her control coldly and deliberately as she shapes a version of a rape. Although she senses that her story has taken on a life of its own, unfettered by reality and untouched by compassion, she chooses not to rewrite. The reader may want to view Briony's testimony to the sheriff as confused, not really what she wants to say.  But the dramatic form once again defeats her:  \\"Did you see him?  \\"I know it was him.\\"  \\"I didn't ask what you knew.  Did you see him?\\"  \\"Yes, I saw him.\\"  And with this lie, this refusal to relinquish control, she consigns her characters to a future not chosen by the circumstances of their lives but by hers.  <BR>    Robbie, her sister Cecilia's love, is disgraced and imprisoned, Cecilia is embittered and alienates herself from her family, and Briony herself becomes a wartime nurse, a person of healing in her effort to atone for the evil that she has done. <BR>    Exactly where and in what form does atonement become present?  Briony grows older and achieves literary prominence.  As the years go by, she drafts and re-drafts her story of the terrible night of the rape, Robbie's wrenching wartime experiences, Cecilia's lost youth,and she finally gets it right. True? Not necessarily, but right. The way she wants it to be. <BR>    So, what do we know and when did we know it?  Did we ever penetrate the words to reach the story's reality or are we still to be numbered among the admirers of Briony's--and McEwan's-- writing?  I feel awed and sad, exhilarated and a touch cheated.  And so, so sorry for Robbie and Cecilia.  <BR>    Then again, who made me sorry?
B00005YW4H|4.0|You don't really hear many records like Come Away With Me anymore.  A 22-year old pianist/vocalist who has a very jazzy voice, and has an album on a jazz label.  Fair enough.  Throw in a Hank Williams cover and you know you've got something a bit different going on.  This album is actually pretty similar to the singer/songwriter albums you'd hear in the 70's.  But at the same time it sounds fresh and new.  The album flows really well, with covers as well as originals by Norah as well as her bandmates Jesse Harris and Lee Alexander.  This is certainly the Dusty In Memphis for my generation.  Who would have thought Arif Mardin, the same producer, would have helmed this record over 30 years later!
B000002UB6|4.0|\\"Let It Be\\" combines the simple with the sophisticated, and because of the former, and its patchwork nature, has been unfairly denigrated.  The Beatles do the simple well, altho here the simple songs are admittedly sparse.  Still, there is enough in total to make a decent album.<br />The best songs are the lovely \\"Across the Universe\\" (John), the title cut (Paul), and the rocker \\"Get Back\\" (Paul).  Altho Paul has said the instrumental and vocal excesses of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" annoyed him, this is still a great song, very evocative.  George ships in with \\"For You Blue\\" and \\"I Me Mine.\\"  Not his best work, but acceptable.  Filler are \\"Maggie Mae\\" and Dig It,\\" but they are not to be taken seriously (literally; they are more attempts at humor, like \\"Why Don't We Do It on the Road\\").  \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"I Dig a Pony\\" are simple, but pretty and fun, respectively.  \\"One After 909,\\" written ten years previously, shows a lack of sophistication, but is OK.
B000063CPL|5.0|Well I must say that I am surprised! 'Rock In Rio' includes great set list, two live cds, extra audio samples from their twelve albums and footage from their up-and-coming 'Rock In Rio' DVD--???? What else can an Iron Maiden fan ask for? The actual live performance is fantanstic and is so much tighter than previous Maiden performances (i.e. 'A Real Live One/A Real Dead One', 'Live At Donnington' which lacked the energy and synchronisation that we expect from IM). I couldn't tell you what a treat it is to hear Adrian back playing the guitar with Maiden again--with Dave and Janick still there, it is an amazing triple-guitar attack. I couldn't have recieved much of a better birthday present than this; I am really looking foward to the DVD of 'Rock In Rio'. Heck, I don't even think that 'Live After Death' was as good as this. Dickinson's voice is back in top-form, Harris is relentess playing bass, Nicko never misses a beat and everyone sounds great. All metal fans will love this album--buy it if you are a true fan of metal. There are 250,000 people in the audience and they sing-along and roar through it all the way. Listen to &quot;The Clansman&quot; and tell me that that is not an emotional experience. Enjoy.  <br />Peace, bros.
B000000W5P|3.0|This is not one of my favorite Stones albums.  Boy, was it ever played in my college days.  The best tune is a cover of The Temptations' \\"Just My Imagination.\\"<br />Not that it is terrible.  The title cut and \\"Far Away Eyes\\" are entertaining, and there are some other moments.  My problems were with the big disco hit \\"Miss You\\" and finding \\"Shattered,\\"  \\"When the Whip Comes Down,\\" and \\"Respectable\\" too harsh, without justification.  The \\"catchiness\\" of \\"Beast of Burden\\" was just blah to me.  It was good when \\"Tattoo You\\" came out, with its more characteristic Stones sound.
B0000069NM|4.0|This is more than a nice little album, MMW &amp; Scofield gel perfectly together. After a few listens you will soon find yourself sad this is not an actual &quot;touring band.&quot; I won't mention high points of the album in this review as it's a lot more fun to discover them yourself.    3.26.02
B000002G89|4.0|Eric Clapton showcases his multitude of talents in this album, in which he even goes into reggae by making the better-known version of \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\" He opens forcefully with \\"Motherless Children,\\" and performs a number of other tunes written by other artists. However, the best song is one he wrote himself, \\"Let It Grow,\\" an excellent ballad. My other favorite on the album is \\"Mainline Florida,\\" the concluding rocker.
1567184855|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT BOOK.  It is very uplifting, letting us know what is out there.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
B000002J09|4.0|The Runes album is known for \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" with \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock & Roll\\" being the other most noteworthy inclusions. \\"Black Dog\\" has a striking, tho repetitive, Jimmy Page riff, an authentic rock and roll signature.  \\"Rock & Roll\\" is one of the essential numbers of a band known for its ability to churn out raw power, what a bassline! But while the album is fine as a whole, it is carried by \\"Stairway,\\" certainly one of the all-time classics, tho I put it on less of a pedestal than most people do. The group explores beauty over blast in this tune (until the very end) and very nicely, and Robert Plant's singing is top notch. \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" have some moments, but overall, I rate Zep II better because of its consistency.
0425180638|1.0|I was a big fan of Patricia Cornwell, until the last precinct.  I know you are going to have to read it to continue the werewolf story line but read it fast so the pain doesn't linger.<br />I think some authors lose it with their character development and this one is lost to fantasy.  The plot line leads us closer to the middle earth than it does to Richmond and the ending appears to be forced like she hit the number of required pages.<br />So I know you will have to read it....just be quick and get the pain over with and go on to another author.
B00005RDCA|5.0|\\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" is Jefferson Airplane's finest moment, and one of the quintessential '60s albums.  So many great records were put out in the late '60s, particularly in the period surrounding and including the \\"Summer of Love,\\" but this is always one of the first mentioned.<br />I had the privilege of hearing Jorma Kaukonen play \\"Embryonic Journey\\" while I was in college in the late 70s, and it evoked for me how great this album is. That lovely, fluid, and weaving solo tune is the only one unaccompanied by singing, and Grace and company do it up with the rest.  There is consistently good instrumentation, but this album is more marked by verse and lyrics, the accompanying melody usually dominating rather than the surrounding music and soloing.  <br />\\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody to Love,\\" which stand as '60s anthems on the magnitude of almost anything, are the highlights of a load of great tracks.  Through the looking glass, and let's love one another.  They have a similar dramatic tone and structure but are still distinctive, and both are superb.  \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" is another memorable song, and provides a forceful conclusion.  \\"My Best Friend\\" is more spirit of the '60s.  \\"DCBA\\" is one of a number of pretty songs, with rhythmic cadences that make it a favorite for me.  \\"Today\\" and \\"Comin' Back to Me\\" are highly evocative, beautiful ballads, with a sort of tripped out aura, but more lyrically dominated.  Indeed, one thing I like about this album is the clear, fluid structures, not the tripped out excesses of the Airplane''s later work.  There are no wasted cuts, as the Airplane make one of the great artistic statement of the 60s.
B00003CXE7|3.0|This movie was overrated. While it's an okay adventure film, the story's plot holes are large and glaring and rather frustrating. The acting was workmanlike, but really undeserving of any extra praise, and Crowe certainly did not give an Oscar-caliber performance.<br />Additionally, the film was disappointingly historically inaccurate. Commodus reigned as emperor for about thirteen years, was a physically imposing individual of daunting martial prowess, and his death was the result of intrigue and poison rather than as portrayed in the film.<br />I wish I'd rented this, rather than having bought a copy for my extensive dvd collection. Oh, well.
B000002OX7|4.0|Excellent album, but falls just short of five stars.  \\"This Song Is Over\\" is the only truly great tune on the album, altho \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" are close.  With its dramatic cadences and wide open visual vista, \\"This Song Is Over\\" is reminiscent of \\"I Can See for Miles and Miles,\\" but better.  Roger Daltrey's singing is superb in this operatic number, passionate and compelling.<br />Evey song is good.  \\"Baba O'Riley\\" chugs toward an accelerating  climax with Pete Townshend's excellent synthesizer work.  Listening to the pretty part of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" lurch into its more forceful second half makes one anticipate that it might be quite something in concert (it was).  \\"Love Ain't for Keeping\\" has fine acoustic guitar by Townshend, who always does well in this area as well as electric.  \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" blasts away in a rousing climax, but I think it is a little overrated.
014028009X|2.0|I guess I'm one of the few people who didn't think this book was fall down hysterical or typical of what women experience in the dating world.  Although it has some funny moments, it didn't keep my interest all the way through, and I ended up putting it down and picking it up over the span of a few weeks.  I actually found the character to be more pitiful, than funny and couldn't help but think, who the heck would do all these stupid things???  I know it's just a book, but I think it's just so-so.
B000002UB3|5.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" is a tour de force. It has a crisp LP side one with distinctive, excellent songs, in contrast to LP side two, which has a medley following the first song, \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\" The songs in this medley are basically incomplete efforts by the Fab Four, but flow together nicely. They rank among the Beatles' best work, as good as it all is.<br />Indeed, it is a tribute to the group that most people seem to consider LP side two better, in spite of the good songs on LP side one. However, side two got a major boost by the opening number \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" George's best song ever and one of the Beatles' very top ever. George lets go of the self-absorption (OK, granted, that came much more later than earlier, altho it still could be present in the '60s) to simply write a simple but very beautiful piece, song and music, relaxing and uplifting in its exquisiteness. George also wrote the best song on LP side one, \\"Something.\\"  John starts LP side one auspiciously, with the catchy (tho with odd beat) big hit \\"Come Together.\\" Paul chips in with the jaunty \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer,\\" and Ringo sings the amusing desire for smugness \\"Octopus's Garden.\\" \\"Oh Darling!\\" is OK but a little intense and sated, and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is, well, too heavy. <br />LP side two's medley is made up of pretty and smooth-flowing tracks, no fuzz boxes, just rhythmic and harmonic music, with a little rock. John's similarly dreamlike \\"Because\\" and \\"Sun King\\" sandwich Paul's lovely piano and vocals in \\"You Never Give Me Your Money.\\" Then \\"Mean Mr. Mustard,\\" \\"Polythene Pam,\\" and \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\" speed up the tempo, and the last four tunes bring in the delayed finality to the album (and paradox: why does \\"Her Majesty\\" follow the karmatic \\"The End\\"?).<br />Let's not split hairs on what should be considered the last Beatle album, this or \\"Let It Be.\\" Just say this is an awesome exit, one of The Fab Four's very best albums ever.
6302752337|5.0|Although I am not a motorcycle rider and I have never used psychedelic drugs, I still found this to be a great movie.  If you have allowed these two elements of the film to keep you from watching it, I highly recommend putting those thoughts aside and viewing this.<br />The main idea of the film is freedom.  Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper take a motorcyle trip across the USA while heading for Mardi Gras.  Although this is the destination, Peter Fonda (is looking for something.  This something could be America, but you feel it is more profound than that.  You receive hints from the things he says to others.<br />For instance, he and Hopper have stopped at a farm to fix one of the bikes and to eat.  After talking with the farmer, Captain USA comments about how great it is to be here on the land doing your own thing.<br />Jack Nicholson has the best lines of the movie when he explains that we love to talk about freedom, but we are scared to death of people who actually live it.  A very important idea considering the war that was going on at the time of this movie.<br />Again, I highly recommend watching this movie.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin I was a good intro, but it is really this album that made superstars of this legendary group, literally blasting them onto the scene.  It is their best album, yes, better than the Runes album.<br />LP side one and side two really exploded for openers, taking you on a trip that stays with you.  What more auspicious beginning than the dynamic \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  Jimmy Page has that unforgettable riff, you know the one I mean.  \\"Heartbreaker\\" similarly started off side two very well, leading right into \\"Living Loving Maid,\\" one of their best songs ever.  Strong catchy verse and great Page guitar work.  \\"The Lemon Song\\" and \\"Ramble On\\" are both good middle tunes, the former being more distinguished because of its hard bass riffs and heavy feel.  \\"Thank You,\\" concluding LP side one, is beautiful, a precursor to \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  In fact, I like it as much.  LP side 2 ended less dramatically, with an unimpressive drum solo in \\"Moby Dick\\" and the fairly plain \\"Bring It on Home.\\"  Doesn't matter, this is one of the greatest hard rock albums ever made.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Aqualung is a wonderful, superlative, essentially perfect album.  From the day it was released right up to now the record is fresh, exciting, compelling, intelligent, forcefully rhythmic, melodic, brilliantly played, brilliantly sung, and has one of the best ever cover illustrations to boot.  After nearly thirty years of wearing out various copies of it, I have yet to tire of this phenomenal artistic tour de force.  <BR>I had the great good fortune of seeing Jethro Tull live when they were doing the original Aqualung tour - they were hardly known at the time - and as great as the album is, their performance was even more electrifying.  It was at Madison Square Garden and I was up front, a few feet from the performers.<BR>As the show started the house lights went down and the stage went black.  Silence.  Long pause.  Then, hobbling out of the blackness a single spotlight caught Anderson dressed extravagantly like the old man on the album cover, bent over and leaning on his flute, which he used as a cane.  Leering maliciously, slowly creeping up front, he finally stopped, silently grinning out at the house as the audience howled with delight.  Then he threw his flute straight up, high, and the spotlight went up with the flute, shining and sparkling as it twisted its way up and then down, the only thing visible in the darkness.<BR>When the flute came back down it was met by Anderson's upraised hand, and at the instant he clutched it all the stage lights came up and the band struck the thunderous opening notes of the album.  And it got better and better and better as the show went on, Anderson leaping and snarling and playing flute at the same time, a truly athletic performance.  Whew!  I can still see it.<BR>If you've somehow denied yourself owning this remarkable work of art and music, get it now!  I wish you many hours of enjoyment listening to this treasure.
B00000255F|5.0|\\"Born to Run,\\" with its assist from Phil Spector, is Bruce Springsteen's finest album.  Bruce's, Clarence's and the others' talents are enhanced with the melodramatic effects Spector provides, with a wonderful result.  This is perhaps most seen in \\"Backstreets,\\" my favorite track along with the title cut.  Swirling, dramatic, what cadences and climaxes!  Better than the opera.  The classic title cut stands out in itself as a great rocker, but Spector's input also helps.<br />The tightly structured \\"She's the One\\" and \\"Tenth Avenue Freezeout\\" are also great songs.  \\"Freezeout\\" has great jazzy effects, cool, very city.  \\"Thunder Road\\" and \\"Jungleland\\" are both good, but with some self-absorption/overdone lyrics that seem forced because the music can't quite keep pace.  However, the visual images of \\"Thunder Road\\" easily compensate, preserving it as a great song.  The quiet \\"Meeting Across the River\\" has enough there to justify its mildness.  \\"Night\\" is plain but with good hard-driving rhythm, and fits in well musically and thematically.
B000003TA5|5.0|Nirvana could be the greatest band to come out of seattle and the sound they bring with them is one of greatness. Nevermind is a great cd. I have two copies of it. Plus other nirvana cds like: unplugged in new york, from the muddy banks, and others.<BR>Its a must have for any music lover.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Santana I was released to great success in late 1969, shortly before the group's memorable rendition of its magnificent song \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" at Woodstock. This robust number is a highlight of the album, for sure, but other great stuff is all around. Carlos Santana's latin guitar introduces itself very auspiciously, with the oft-seen rock/R&B/blues and jazz influences. But rhythmic and melodic, for sure, and perhaps most prominently in this recording. Indeed, more than any other Santana album, this debut is marked by structured music and tight arrangements, in many cases in a verse/chorus setting but the longer more drawn out cuts as well. In addition to \\"Soul Sacrifice,\\" check out \\"Jingo,\\" with its Afro-Cuban flavor. Primitive beat, heavy bass, surrounded by great organ work as well as guitar. <br />\\"Jingo\\" was similar structure in tone to the group's own \\"Waiting,\\" opening the album reflecting on good things to come, and the band then performs its hit version of Willie Bobo's \\"Evil Ways.\\" This is followed by \\"Shades of Time,\\" with its fluid delivery and brief but pressing, expressive soloing by Carlos. Another highlight is the fine \\"Persuasion,\\" steady and earnest, the band again very together. \\"Treat,\\" with jazzy piano and Santana guitar, is a hint at Santana's frequent preoccupation with this genre in the future. Dynamic and captivating, \\"Soul Sacrifice,\\" no vocals, is a memorable instrumental finale. Gregg Rolie's excellent organ weaves around the heavy rhythm and lead guitars, and Mike Shreve's drumming and great soloing and Chepito Areas' conga make this a percussion masterpiece.<br />Unlike the majority of people, I do not believe Santana I was superseded by the follow-up \\"Abraxas,\\" maybe equalled. LP side one of Abraxas was better, but the remainder measured short of LP Side 2 here. Aside from Caravanserai, these early works represent Santana's finest moments.
B0000024Z7|5.0|\\"Caravanserai\\" represents Carlos Santana's finest moment, in my book, even considering his superb first two albums. His jazz/rock fusion becomes largely dominated by jazz here, with less of the raw latin beat/latin sound, altho these are present in more refined form. The jazz is modern, fairly often fast-paced and hard driving, and very rhythmic and melodic. It is the music that is the thing, for only three of the entries have lyrics. Santana delivers a tour de force, a work of compelling beauty, and one of my all-time favorite recordings.<br />A highlight (in fact, probably the best track) is the group's rendition of Jobim's \\"Stone Flower.\\" The Santana band not only expands upon, but outdoes, the Brazilian master's composition, delivering terrific, smooth guitar and keyboards, par excellence as a rhythmic display. Piano sometimes take over the lead, and the percussion is also great, including a cuica, a new Brazilian instrument. Everything else is also very enjoyable. Among the other songs, \\"Fuente del Ritmo,\\" which comes after \\"Stone Flower,\\" has a latin percussion beat, sort of bouncy in feel, combined with jazzy guitar work. \\"Every Step of the Way,\\" the brilliant concluding number, while repetitive, has a great fast-paced guitar motif that carries one down the visual horizon.<br />As to the earliner tunes, the opener, \\"Eternal Caravan of Reincarnation,\\" is very pretty with moderate substance, reminiscent of \\"Singing Winds, Crying Beasts.\\" It leads right into the excellent \\"Waves Within,\\" with soft, beautiful, smooth-flowing riffs, yes, like waves. After more good but brief instrumentation in \\"Look up (To See What's Coming Down),\\" we hit our first vocals in \\"Just in Time to See the Sun.\\" Then, \\"Song of the Wind,\\" a Santana classic, showcases Carlos's and Neal Schon's ability for pretty, high-pitched guitar twangs (reference \\"Samba Pati Ti,\\" \\"Europa,\\" \\"Moonflower\\"). It is followed by \\"All the Love of the Universe.\\" Can it match the title? Yes, its great! Schon andorganist Gregg Rolie deliver blistering, jazzy solos.<br />In fact, each of the titles to the songs seems to be a visual representation of the particular song's lovely music, always accompanied by great percussion. Hardly anything I've ever heard matches the fabulous music, the fluid, driving pleasure that the Santana group dishes out here.
B000024D4R|5.0|This stuff is simply the best Floyd album I have ever heard. It is the last \\"big\\" album of Pink Floyd. For me this album is simply the top of the work of Pink Floyd. It is very hard to create a better album after the great albums: \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", \\"Echoes\\", \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall\\"; But Pink Floyd made the incredible thing: They createt \\"Animals\\". Instrumentally it is perfect (\\"Pigs\\", \\"Sheep\\") and vocally Roger Waters and David Gilmour hormonized better than ever before (\\"Dogs\\"). Buy this CD, then you will own one of the greatest album created in the 20th century!!!

B00005JKED|5.0|The best Bad Guys are the ones who we in love with.  They have a magnetic attraction to them, a mysterious air that always keeps us intrigued.  We want to be with them, want to be like them.  Denzel Washington knows this.  His character seduces Ethan Hawke so slowly, with such charm and street-smart grace that by the time the Bad Guys have crossed &quot;the Line&quot;, you can no longer tell right from wrong.  You wonder if maybe you crossed that line 30 minutes ago and didn't realize it.  <br />Hawke plays a rookie cop who is assigned to an elite narcotics squad of the LAPD, and Washington is the head of that squad, the cop who will train the new guy.  Hawke has one day to make it or break it.  The film is about that day.  Hawke being the rookie that he is, is a straight-arrow that wants to arrest every offender he sees.  Washington is the old timer with patience, who basically holds the new guy back - don't catch the little fish if they can lead you to the big ones.  Their relationship develops in a beatiful combination of police action scenes and wonderfully written dialog.  From the first moment, you are wondering if Denzel isn't a bad cop, but by the time you know for sure - Pow! - he's got you. <br />What makes this film even more entertaining is that it is so obviously accurate and realistic, it makes &quot;Boys in the Hood&quot; look like fantasy.  If you don't like foul language, this isn't your kind of movie.  The locations are real LA ghettos, the people are real Crypts and Bloods.  Director Antoine Fuqua has many friends who are undercover narcotics agents, and thus has brought that knowledge to the film with intense authority. Denzel and Hawke also add outstanding performances which remind me that human nature is basic and universal to many people in many situations.  Even the extras in this film stare through the camera into the audience's soul, watching for any sign of weakness.  <br />The DVD is excellent, a good transfer in both visual and audio quality, and with some standard, average extras.  The &quot;making of&quot; documentary is short but comprehesive, and doesn't try to sell the film like some bad HBO special.  The audio commentary by the director was my favorite, as he describes just how much in this film is the real circumstance for undercover cops.  Nothing &quot;Hollywood&quot; here.
B000002UA7|1.0|Yes, sure, great songs by this talented artist. But why did they include New Vocals in Wuthering Heights? The song sounds like it is recorded in some bathroom. Absolute a no buy, or.....do like me and make a new recording, including the original wuthering heights, ripped from vinyl.
6304077955|5.0|The intellectual meanderings of sociopath. Insightful at the core and jagged at the edges. Tale of the disconnected, obsessively aware waifs of our modern society. Can You Dig It? Worth multiple viewings. Raving monologues include such treats as \\"Resolve is never stronger than the night after it was never weaker\\". More inside, come explore.
B00005JKED|4.0|Ethan Hawke plays a young policeman who wants to enter the narcotics division of the L.A.P.D.  He is teamed up with a cop played by Denzel Washington who is supposed to train him and test whether he would make it on the tough streets of L.A.  Hawke discovers in an ever more horrifying day that Washington will do whatever he considers necessary to get the job done.  The senior cop alternately shocks, bullies, and terrifies the rookie with every kind of mayhem imaginable.  Both men put in terrific performances in this gritty, raw tale of life on the narc squad.  Be forewarned that there are lots of tough scenes in an ever-escalating tale of terror and corruption.
B00005K3OT|1.0|The promotional materials alone from Chocolat will clue in the average viewer that its producers have pulled one over on its audience. As you walk out of the theater (or return the rental) be reminded of who is on the movie poster. Hey! Isn't that Johnny Depp? Given his high visibility on the movie poster one would think he is a playing a major character in the film! Truth be told, we only see him and his guitar for about fifteen minutes. After a romp with Binoche's character, Depp's usefulness as a morality plot point against the backdrop of a staunchly Catholic French town is complete, and he strummingly floats down the river with his (Irish?) gypsies (and, I suppose, hops back on shore to collect his check from Mirimax and sprint away from this stinker of a movie).<br />I like films which use food as a healing device (which always revolves around ethnic minorities or, in this case, the oddball in an orthdox society) but I just can't buy this \\"healing chocolate\\" clap-trap. Binoche's character is part medicine man, part mystic and fully unbelievable. Watch as every person comes into her chocolate shop complaining of whatever ailment there is under the sun. Binoche answers, \\"I have just the thing for you,\\" and hands you a chocolate. Gout, sleep disorders, scurvy, rheumatic fever, the bends, St. Vitus' Dance... just head on down to the wee, cute, adorable, inexplicably ornately decorated (for a woman who just wandered into town with her child) sweet shop and have a truffle. Whoops! There goes my goiter! Thank you Juliette.<br />Pass.
B000003BDJ|5.0|The Rolling Stones have put out so many albums and songs, face it. Each note back-to-back would take you around the globe. As big a fan as I am of them, however, I still believe that they have their share of wasted or uninteresting cuts, and when measured against the best groups, more than their share. In light of what I stated above, this is somewhat understandable. But they remain one of the greatest groups, because of their greatest songs. For example, The Who's albums as as a whole are more balanced, with not so many so-so cuts. But when it comes to best songs, the Stones reign triumphant. There are very, very few greatest hits collections by anybody that outdo \\"Hot Rocks.\\"<br />I miss \\"Last Time\\" and \\"Not Fade Away,\\" which were on \\"High Tide and Green Grass\\"--they would have been better choices than the first two. (However, Buddy Holly is represented by \\"Play with Fire.\\") I also would have liked to see \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking.\\" Otherwise, the selection is right on target. \\"Brown Sugar,\\" Sympathy for the Devil,\\" and \\"Gimme Shelter\\" are all here, along with the great rocking short cuts: \\"Jumping Jack Flash,\\" \\"Get Off of My Cloud,\\" \\"Let's Spend the Night Together,\\" and \\"Honky Tonk Women.\\" Then, there is the precious \\"As Tears Go By,\\" one of the best things The Stones, or anyone, ever recorded.<br />No import that Chuck Berry, a focus of their early work, is not included--I'm happier with the songs written by the Stones themselves. All are such gems, like \\"Paint It Black,\\" \\"Under My Thumb,\\" and \\"Ruby Tuesday.\\" You will Get all your Satisfaction, All You Want, with this collection.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|I cannot waste more than a few sentences on this terrible, absolutely not funny, piece of trash film.  I am so disgusted with myself for having purchased this DVD and contributing money towards production of absolute TRASH like this...  This is one BULLET I didn't dodge...
B000002P2W|4.0|This is a more down-to-earth collection of songs for The Who, in view of their recent ambitious projects, and a fine album. Pete Townshend is more focused on mid-life than teenage glory, and uses sparsity instead of embellishment in doing so in a collection of consistently good songs. The acoustic (OK, Banjo), jaunty \\"Squeeze Box\\" is a highlight, along with the opener, \\"Slip Kid.\\" In this latter song and others, such as the pretty \\"Imagine a Man,\\" \\"How Many Friends Have I Really Got,\\" and \\"However Much I Booze,\\" Townshend looks inward (well, perhaps at other band members too). \\"They Are All in Love\\" seems to be an underrated gem.<br />Not just synthesizers, but electric guitar, are less prominent as the acoustic sound and straight keyboards flow in their place. \\"Who by Numbers\\" is more low-key for this dynamic group, but still a fine album. Note also that the good lyrics play their part in maintaining quality. For another side of The Who, get this one.
0066620996|3.0|The illusion is that a company can go from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;great&quot; with the linear thinking and measurement mentality of the Mass Production business model.  This may be true if the only criteria is stock price or shareholder value. Mr. Collins frequently uses the words, &quot;the transformation from Good to Great.&quot; This begs the question, what was transformed? In almost every example the &quot;business model&quot; of Mass Production was transformed to meet the exact needs of a specific customer expectation. Every company arrived at a higher state of &quot;customization&quot; with their customers yet Mr. Collins explains this as having passion for your work. Transformational Change is a &quot;conscious and intentional&quot; activity.  I was surprised that the Level 5 Leaders were &quot;intentional&quot; but not &quot;consciously aware&quot; of how to make the change.  Most of the examples used in the book happened over many years, leading me to conclude that the transformational process was an unconscious process.  In todays fast paced change environment, a company must be transformed and the Leadership model can't be &quot;unconsciously&quot; applied.  I recently listened to a CEO's who read the book proclaim the Vision of going to Greatness for his company, yet the process of change is that of the old &quot;crisis&quot; mentality.  Mr. Collins would have helped the readers if he would have focused some time on the word &quot;Transformantion&quot; as a Leadership process. It would also be helpful to know that transformational changes must often be simulated before beginning in order to understand the incredible shift in the Mass Production business model that is involved. The imbedded muscle memory of Mass Production thinking is the barrier to Greatness.
B000002572|3.0|\\"Boston\\" was a commercially smashing debut album, but while the songs are structured well musically, the song quality is mediocre, unimaginative, and without substance. Even perhaps the best stuff, the soloing on \\"Foreplay,\\" has elements of clicheishness. I also don't like Brad Delp's wailing vocals. Still, Boston's music has been effective radio fare and attracted a lot of interest.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I think &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; is the best film all over the world.It is full of with tuning cars, good girl( like Joranda Brewster). So it is fantastic.
B000002UAU|5.0|\\"Sergeant Pepper\\" was the first album I ever bought. However, I need not feel I am just being sentimental in declaring this brilliant concept album was one of the finest ever.<br />The best comes first and last, as the spirited title cut moves into Ringo's observation that he gets both \\"by\\" and \\"high\\" with \\"a little help from my friends.\\" Great lyrically, catchy, quintessential '60s too. It may be true that John, as he said, was influenced by a painting, but I can't help but thinking that \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" with its psychedelic atmosphere, was put in with other thoughts as well. LP side two concluded with a reprise of the title cut and the amazing \\"A Day in the Life,\\" a palpable joint effort by John and Paul. Dreamy mood, consciousness exploring, powerfully climactic, words are not enough. I'm a big Doors fan, rating their debut album above \\"Pepper,\\" but this entry is far superior to \\"The End.\\"<br />My other favorite song is \\"When I'm Sixty-Four,\\" one of Paul's best ever, lilting beat and evocative lyrics. Paul also shines with \\"Lovely Rita.\\" His standard syrupy entry, \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" is sandwiched between his own \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" which sounds interestingly similar to the preceding Paul number \\"Getting Better,\\" and John's carnivalesque \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite.\\" <br />It is now almost 35 years ago today, but the legacy of \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" endures.
B0000640VO|4.0|An adorable film. I thought it dragged toward the end, but then picked up in the end. It is original and humane and sweet. I wish the world were made up of Amelies. We'd never have war nor cruelty. I know a 15 year old girl who looks and acts exactly like Amelie. I told her so. She said, \\"My mom tells me the same thing.\\"  I'd seen Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film \\"Delicatessen\\" after reading Mick Jagger say it was one of his favorites. I like \\"Delicatessen\\" but like \\"Amelie\\" even more. I want to marry Amelie!
B000002G8H|4.0|Eric Clapton always could handle the softer touch, but had not shown it as frequently on one album as he did on \\"Slowhand.\\" He is well-supported in this endeavor by Yvonne Elliman's vocals. \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" and the beautiful instrumental \\"Peaches and Diesel\\" are trademarks of this recording, which also contains \\"Next Time You See Her\\" and \\"May You Never.\\" My favorite, recognizable by many but not because of the title, is \\"The Core.\\" Eric and Marcy Levy combine their vocals in a very pretty song with a steady guitar-driven beat. <br />The most prominent songs are the excellent cover version of \\"Cocaine,\\" which became a minor anthem of the late '70s, and \\"Lay Down Sally,\\" with a guitar riff similar to that on \\"The Core\\" but a less dramatic while catchier chorus.<br />\\"Slowhand\\" is one of Clapton's better moments, a very pleasant interlude that should be enjoyable by everyone.
0446677450|5.0|This book is somewhat general in explaining topics, yet it is a must-read for people who are just starting to make smart financial decisions and learn about money. The concepts in this book are simple, yet many people don't fully understand them, and many get offended when they read the book. Some feel that it is an insult to their wonderful financial intelligence to have things explained to them the way Robert does...which is why many of them are poor. I strongly advise people to read this book, as it is an important step towards becoming financially independent.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is so filled with excellent tracks, representing so many different musical influences, that a commentator can simply ask, \\"where do I start\\"? The only negative (if it is) that can perhaps be proffered is that it lacks structure as a concept album, with its random dissemination of endless good songs. Well, OK, Disk One is superior to Disk Two, but Disk Two is also excellent. In any event, the White Album is one of The Beatles' best. It is also the first point at which members of the group, particularly John, begin to make political statements, as opposed to the general substantive observations about life and love and spirituality (and substances) that started with Rubber Soul.<br />The best song is \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" as George's acoustic guitar comes thru nicely with an assist from Eric Clapton, who simulates crying with his guitar to back an earnestly passionate verse. Very pretty and melodically rich, it has facets of Eastern influence and thus displays George's emerging mystical bent. Paul has a remarkable lively nursery-rhyme, bouncy entry, \\"OB-La-Di, OB-La-Da,\\" another of the strongest tracks. Completely original in structure, it is a further demonstration of his vast reserve of songwriting brilliance. However, the preeminent song is Paul's \\"Back in the USSR,\\" one of the Beatles' best works of old-line rock 'n roll music, as in \\"any old way you choose it.\\" Apparently influenced by Little Richard, this song became the White Album's trademark. \\"Birthday\\" is another rousing rocker, more just a blast of raw guitar power. It works just right for the occasion, great for college. <br />Similar themes and mood settings are explored. John's beautiful \\"Julia\\" (dedicated to his mother) is preceded by Paul's \\"I Will.\\" The latter is pretty in Paul's lighthearted style, with nice acoustic guitar, but \\"Julia\\" is beautiful and highly evocative, a triumph of soft passion. Dedicated to John's mother, it is also sort of a forerunner of \\"Because\\" on Abbey Road. John also has a very pretty entry in the second track of the album, \\"Dear Prudence.\\" John and Paul also both do the American West. In \\"Bungalow Bill,\\" originating with a tiger killing in India, John makes sarcastic commentary about the Western gun-toting mentality. Paul's \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" is my darkhorse favorite. Instrumentally sparse with its acoustic guitar, it is another song displaying Paul's abilities to come up with unique musical structures, moving from verbose poetry to tighter verselines. John's \\"I'm So Tired\\" is reminiscent of \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" except more intense. Ringo sings the soft lullaby finale, \\"Good Night.\\" Animals is another theme, but this time it is Paul and George. Paul's \\"Martha My Dear\\" is supposedly about a sheep dog. His lovely acoustic \\"Blackbird\\" is one of the strongest songs. George appears to be making jabs at the middle class establishment with the baroque, or Elizabethan, sounding \\"Piggies\\" and its harpsichord. <br />John sets himself apart in current events/politics, showing the beginning of his idealistic while radical attitudes with the more-controlled-than-later \\"Revolution.\\" His former mentor, The Maharishi, is the focus of his negative commentary in \\"Sexy Sadie.\\" The unfortunate Manson murders are treated in the harsh \\"Helter Skelter.\\" Instead of the looking glass, John looks through a \\"Glass Onion.\\" By contrast, Paul displays his typical lighter touch in \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son.\\"<br />The overall noteworthy thing about the White Album is that more than any other Beatles work, it showcases the Fab Four's variety of talents.
B00005JKES|5.0|I own Twin Peaks on all 3 formats available: video, LD and now, DVD. The DVD collection is stunning. The picture is clear and beautiful. The menu is fun, keeps you kinda guessing. I cannot wait for the 2nd season to come out, then my collection will be complete. <br />If you own a DVD player, and you loved this show, the DVDs are well worth it... esp the Commentaries! <br />BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT.
B00000J7J4|3.0|I still long for the days of the 70s, when this fine Mexican guitarist shined with brilliance.  This album may have been a huge commercial success, but not one song on it is interesting to me.  Dave Matthews and Eric Clapton and many other guests, it does not matter.  Just pop and plainness with limited and so-so soloing, a pale shadow of Carlos's best moments.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Sadly, the mastermind behind Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder has passed on recently, but his genius lives on in this dark comedic indictment of Hollywood and its star system. The film shot William Holden to stardom and he became a major player in the '50s and it also afforded Gloria Swanson her last piece of public honor and she made a dramatic comeback as faded screen star Norma Desmond. Both she and Holden earned Oscar nominations here as did supporting players Erich von Stroheim (Max the butler) and Nancy Olson (as a script reader and love interest of Holden's screenwriter Joe Gillis). The film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director (Wilder), but unfortunately it lost on all counts.....possibly because Hollywood felt bullied and intimidated by Wilder's not-so-rosy depiction of their little town. Wilder even received death threats during and after filming. Classic dialogue and forever memorable scenes abound (the chimpanzee burial scene is a keeper). This black comedy may seem too morbid and ghoulishly funny for some tastes, but it is one of my absolute favorites........
B00005RHGK|4.0|Brother and sister (Justin Long and Gina Phillips) discover the lair of a demonic being and find themselves the target of this hell-bent creature.  Superb horror/thriller harkens back to the &quot;old-style&quot; of the 80's, aiming entirely for suspense and scares over hip dialogue and rock music.  Writer/director Victor Salva brings style and atmosphere and nicely understates the mood.  Good performances from Long and Phillips, which serves to make the chilling finale all the more effective.
B000002UAF|5.0|By 1964 the Beatles were becoming quite popular.  They had already released two previous hit albums in 1963 and had recently appeared on a classic American tv landmark episode of The Ed Sullivan show in Febuary of 1964.  Their movie that was coming out at the time \\"A Hard Days Night\\"<BR>was a box office smash and it soundtrack album proved that the Beatles were going to be big stars.<br />However when you boil away all the starlit spotlight you have an awesmoe album alone.  A Hard Days Night proved that the Beatles were revolutionaries.  Why?  Becuase music was never the same after Beatlemania.<br />The opening track A HARD DAYS NIGHT is a classic Beatles anthem.  I SHOULD OF KNOWN BETTER is a catchy tune.  IF I FELL is the ultimate love ballad.  I'M HAPPY JUST TO DANCE WITH YOU showcases George Harrison's talents. AND I LOVE HER is a wonderful latin influenced tune.  TELL ME WHY is a Beatles romp tune and of course everyone knows the classic CAN'T BUY ME LOVE.<BR>Other songs on this album that did not appear in the Beatles movie were some nice rockers such as ANYTIME AT ALL and I'LL CRY INSTEAD.  THINGS WE SAID TODAY is one of the most intewresting Beatles tunes.    WHEN I GET HOME and YOU CAN'T DO THAT are other classic Beatles tunes and the closing track I'LL BE BACK has some great lyrics.<br />The Beatles third album was a landark for them because it was when they made it huge in America.  Not only that but it was the best Beatles album to come out of the can at the time.  Lennon And McCartney are wonderful.<br />Overall A Hard Days Night is classic early Beatles that is nothing but essential.  If you love the Bealtes you'll love this.  Highly recommended!
1558908455|3.0|Vampires are the owners of a seedy bar in Mexico and ALL hell breaks loose when George Clooney and company arrive.  That should be the plot, but it takes about an hour for the action to begin.  Thankfully, the last 45 minutes are wildly entertaining.  I still prefer The Faculty when it comes to genre pics from Robert Rodriguez.  Quentin Tarantino's pretty hilarious as an incredibly insane bank robber.
B000002UB6|5.0|In early 1969 the Beatles began to record what would supposedly be their final album.  However this \\"live performance\\" album was recorded than eventually shelved due to band disagreements and simply the fact that they never put their hearts into the recording sessions.  The group then went on to record the much stronger \\"Abbey Road\\" and released it as the bands final effort.  In early 1970 the Beatles had basically stopped working together when John Lennon decided to salvage Let It Be and have Phil Spector clean it up.  Therefore in May 1970 the Beatles final album relased (not recorded) hit stores.<br />Now it's no secret that Let It Be has been bashed for years and years after it origianl release and it unfortunetly still does get trashed today.  However the album is not as bad as everyone says.  It's actually pretty nice despite it wildly uneven feel but it is nowhere near the best Beatles album.<br />The opening track TWO OF US is a nice tune with some impressive acoustic guitar.  DIG A PONY is a great rocker.  ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is downright beautiful.  I ME MINE is another great rocker by George Harrison.  The title track LET IT BE is a rock 'n roll anthem of exceptional beauty.  I'VE GOT A FEELING is very alternative rock feeling and some great vocals by McCartney.  ONE AFTER 909 is a very fun catchy rocker.  THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD is a pretty song but I find it greatly depressing sort of an \\"end of the Beatles\\" feel to it.  FOR YOU BLUE is another Harrison gem with a blues feel.  And finally the closing track GET BACK is an awesome Beatles tune.  The other two tracks MAGGIE MAE and DIG IT are little junky forty/fifty second dialouge pieces that seem to bog the album down a bit.<br />With the release of LET IT BE the Beatles had long stopped working together by the time of it's pressing and they announced their break up immidiately after its release.  <br />In conclusion Let It Be is a very underrated effort by the Beatles.  If you boil away all the bad history that surrounds this record you have a nice little album that is actually quite listenable.  I also hope that sooner or later they release the film Let It Be but right now it's out of print!  Anyway I highly recommend this album there are some great songs here!  Highly recommended!
B00005B36H|5.0|This was the best album of 2001.  That is pretty clear.<br />This is also Tool's best album.  That is also pretty clear.<br />Actually I think this is the best album ever, but you might<br />disagree on this point.<br />For me, the album is basically the interplay between Adam's<br />guitar and Justin's bass.  The drumming is very complicated and<br />spectacular.  The vocals are somewhat subdued but they are<br />also great.<br />The most inventive song I think is Schism, for its weird rhythm.<br />The prettiest song is the Patient.  There is a great guitar<br />solo in Parabola.  The pinnacle of the album is the end of the<br />very long Reflection, whose lyrics have a deep meaning.<br />Some advice: Go get yourself a guitar or bass, tune the E string<br />down to D (except for Parabola, where you need a low B), get an<br />appropriate-sized pick, et bonne chance!
B00005RHGK|5.0|This movie was great! I loved it a lot. The beginning was extreamly frightening and bloody. Gina Philips who plays the sister Trisha is HOT as hell! The Creeper is more scarier when you don't see his face. He could have been more scarier, but who cares, Jeepers Creeper is scary as hell and is so kick-[behind]! I was on the edge of my seat and totally horrified. Yes, I am asking the same question everyone else is asking, \\"Why did they go back?\\". I agree that they should have just drove off. I still don't care because this movie was scary and awesome! The ending was good and takes place at a police station like the 'Resident Evil' video games. ..., the movie was a spin-chilling movie with lots of chills and thrills! So what's eating you? Go see this movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B0000257O9|5.0|Superb! You can use this CD for your Hi-Fi demo or exhibition. 20 reviewers before me have stated their opinions, I just want to add that Island Records release contain 3 extra tracks: Island (an instrumental reggaeish), Technopop, and Johnny On The Monorail (A Very Different Version) totally 47 and a half minutes.<BR>Musically fantastic, technically excellent, a rare one.<BR>Sorry I can't compare between the US release and UK release, but I'm very satisfied with my purchase.<BR>My rating:<BR>Sound quality: ***** include this CD in your audiophile stuff collections<BR>Performance: ***** want to listen again and again, very interesting melody, rhythm and sound effects<BR>Presentation: **** 12 pages, photos and informative notes from Geoff Downes.
0804106304|5.0|Although there are already alot of reviews of this book, I have to add my voice. This novel is one of my favorites of all time. I couldn't put it down. The struggles between the mothers and daughters to understand one another and relate to one another is something I can relate to, as I think many women can, even though many readers will not relate to the cultural issues. The relationship between a mother and daughter is one of humanity's most complex, and Tan does an exquisite job of capturing the dynamic. I could relate to the struggles of the four daughters to connect with and live up to the expectations of their mothers. I also loved the imagery in the novel; it is some of the most beautiful, lyrical prose I have ever had the pleasure to read. I highly reccommend this book -- it should especially appeal to women who have had complex, occassionally conflictual, relationships with their mothers.
B000002GFC|4.0|I really like all the songs on this best of album by Cream except the remastering as its called is BAD! I'd like to give it a 5 but I think that with todays up to date technology they could of made it sound like stereo and not MONO!!
B000056NX5|5.0|Great up-to-date version of JCS. Have watched it over and over again, and each time it only gets better. Would definitely recommend as an addition to your dvd collection.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is probably what everybody else wrote about this album if they loved it aswell. It's phenomenal! Although i have to admit that when i first bought it and stuck it in the stereo i didn't like it all that much. But the intro to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was the greatest sound that ever went through my ears. It kicks... I just listened to it over and over again. I couldn't get sick of it, and as soon as i got a guitar that ws the first thing i tried to play. And when i finally mastered it i felt like a god. Kurt Cobain proved to the all musicians that you don't have to play complicated to be great. Not to say that i don't respect Steve Vai (espcially \\"The Audience is Listening\\". It rocks!)Look at \\"Rape Me\\". It's one of his greatest songs and it basically consists of 4 chords, and the intro to \\"Polly\\", \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and so on.Just to set the record straight, InUtro is not as good as Nevermind and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is their best song. Oh yeah, i think Nirvana has the best unplugged album ever. My favourite song from it is \\"Lake of Fire\\". If you don't agree, i don't blame yah.I hated it at first but now i love it. (And yeah i know, it's not their song.)
6300214540|3.0|It's a typical Hollywood film that has nothing to do with the real deal of fighter pilots.  First of all, if Maverick had abandoned his wingman, disobeyed an order to land, and messed ih hgis plane, he would of been kicked out if a heart beat in the real Navy.  Secondly, what is up with quitting because your backseater died.  All pilots experience death of a love one and that's no reason to quit...
B00003CX9Q|5.0|....and go see this movie!!!  I saw the re-release yesterday afternoon.  LOVED IT!!!!  One of the most wonderful movies ever to cross the big screen.  I first saw ET twenty years ago (oh, I was so young then) and loved it then too.  It will make you laugh and shed a tear or two.  Truly heart-warming in every way.  It doesn't matter if you are 5 or 105, it is a delight for everyone.  Do yourself a favor...see this movie..turn on your heartlight now!
0064471837|5.0|That's all I can say about this book, WOW. Although, if you get scared easily, don't read this book at night. No, no, this isn't one of those scary books, but it does have some weird plots and settings in the story. But don't be deceived by that!! This book is just as well written as Shade's Children, and even better. I just finished Sabriel last night, and all I'm wondering right now, is HOW Garth Nix thought of the setting and plot for this, because it's just amazing.<br />Also, I don't think it really interferes with any religious beliefs, but it might. So I'm not sure about that. However, if you just don't care and want to read an interesting book, this is the book for you.
6302886228|5.0|I'm watching this right now.... I agree....where is the DVD???
0684800713|3.0|The themes and the propaganda get a 3 -- of course,<BR>the style and the influence get a 5.<BR>  I suppose everyone goes through a Hemingway \\"phase\\" --<BR>fortunately not everyone gets locked into it like some<BR>sort of inescapable, fanatic, static Twilight Zone.<BR>  So what's right here?  Hemingway's novels are very<BR>accessible -- very readable -- even for the person who<BR>might hate novel reading.  There are no paragraphs of<BR>dense wording like Faulkner.  There is the lean, spare<BR>(would we insult the ancients to call it \\"Spartan\\"?)<BR>prose -- there is the seductive ambience conveyed with<BR>clever, clipped irony and innuendo.  There is a sort<BR>of fateful \\"justice\\" here in which some of the more<BR>deserving characters get their come-uppance (at least<BR>at the hands of the author playing \\"god\\" -- even if<BR>it might not happen in real life).  <BR>  What is wrong here?  Lots.  Maybe Faulkner was a <BR>boozer too -- I don't know, I never met him, never<BR>consorted with him.  But if his Nobel Prize acceptance<BR>speech is any indication of where his real values were,<BR>then he stands hands and shoulders above Hemingway in<BR>terms of themes and values.  For Hemingway only shows<BR>us forlorn, ironic, self-excusing modernist \\"brats\\"<BR>who justify messing up their own and other people's<BR>lives in the name of their supposed world-weariness,<BR>psychological angst, and post-World War I disillusionment.<BR>It would be one thing if the disillusionment and the<BR>wasteland and the frenzied lifestyle to avoid looking<BR>into the pit of their own apparent meaninglessness<BR>and the meaninglessness of existence were the actual<BR>depiction here -- but one gets the feeling that this<BR>is only a very clever cover-up.  A lifestyle and<BR>self-adulation masquerading as a \\"credo\\" -- rather<BR>than a heart-felt, true vision of nihilism and<BR>what to do in the face of it.<BR>  There is an issue here of a man and an artist<BR>afraid to face his \\"gentler\\" side (I refrain from<BR>insulting women, which HE certainly did, by calling<BR>it his \\"feminine\\" side).  Now whether there is also<BR>a fear here of facing up to some subliminal homosocial,<BR>or homosexual impulses, and whether that is a reason<BR>to take him to task as a writer and a person, that<BR>is left up to you to decide.  But that fear, and<BR>the desire to let hints of it out, and yet condemn<BR>it for the sake of himself and his readers and his<BR>acceptability -- while lashing out at women and<BR>the female as the great white \\"Bitc--s\\" is another<BR>negative, in my view. Why lash out at women, if you<BR>are afraid to \\"Know Thyself!\\"???<BR>  True, Hemingway was wounded, probably felt pain,<BR>maybe even some grief -- but then look at what his later<BR>life became after he became successful.  Was his end<BR>the end of a Stoic -- or the end of a weakened, no-longer<BR>Number One idol, fallen from the \\"grace\\" of critical<BR>and public adulation (like a has-been athlete who<BR>is quickly forgotten)?  Of course Hemingway won't<BR>be forgotten -- he got the Nobel Prize, too.  Funny,<BR>no one seems to remember HIS speech. <BR>  Because of the sunlight, the clever irony, the<BR>unforgettable characters, the trout fishing and<BR>readability, this is my \\"favorite\\" among the<BR>Hemingway novels.  I also enjoy very much many of<BR>his short stories, published as THE SHORT STORIES<BR>OF ERNEST HEMINGWAY by Charles Scribner's Sons.<BR>  But locked into Hemingway idolatry? -- no way, \\"man\\"!
B00004YKUY|5.0|This is just one damn fine CD. If you are a TRUE Journey fan, this one is as good as any of the previous Journey records. I am saddened that this CD didn't have more commercial success than it did, cause the guys obviously put alot into this effort. First of all, Steve Augeri more than fills the great Steve Perry's shoes, he absolutely shines on this album. If you ever see the band live, you'll be amazed the way he does the old stuff! On Arrival, my first impression is that Jonathan Cain had a strong influence over all the songs, which is great. He's co-written most of their greatest hits. Starting from the first track \\"Higher Place\\", clear through the CD, there is no doubt that this another great Journey Record. My personal favorites are the powerful \\"Signs Of Life\\" with a guitar solo that sounds refreshingly familiar, and \\"Livin To Do\\" which has a bluesy feel, and for a little kick in the butt \\"Nothin Comes Close\\" has a fun, groovy, rockin sound. Also of note, Neal Schon is one fine guitarist, and his powerful and melodic style ranks him up there with the best ever. Ross Valory keeps playin' that punchy Journey-esque stuff, and Deen Castronovo is as good a drummer as has ever played in Journey. Again, if you like some of their early stuff, but only the \\"Seperate Ways\\" \\"Wheel In The Sky\\" type stuff, you may not like this one, but if you liked \\"Faithfully\\" and \\"Who's Cryin\\" then this album will sure fit into your tastes. Get it! There aren't too many groups out there putting this type of music out these days. Journey Rocks!
B00003CX95|5.0|Greater than Braveheart? I have to admit I was a bit reluctant to watch this movie because all of the hype. I didn't see it until about 3 years after it was released. One bored Sunday night resulted in plopping myself down in front of the tube to finally see this flick. I quickly scolded myself for not watching it earlier! Braveheart is the ultimate epic of modern times and Mel Gibson is a genius!! Not only is the story of William Wallace, yes there is a bit of artistic liberty, captivating but the scenery/atmosphere absolutely MADE this movie. <BR>The vision of Mr. Gibson, John Toll and the music is simply astonishing. Everytime I watch it is like the first time. The movie left me in awe, as I'm sure it will do for most viewers. Yes, I do have other favorite movies but this is definitely in the Top 10.
B000060P79|5.0|i luv simple plan, theyre my FAVORITE band! :) everyone should go get npnhjb. it totally rocks.
B00004SCX6|2.0|is like a burning building, you want to look away but are compelled to watch. I only bought this cd for the song \\"Stronger\\" and that's pretty much the only one I like, other than \\"Oops!..I Did It Again\\". There's only so much that can be said for pre-fabricated pop culture. Sure it's fun for now but fame is fickle. Sorry Britney. Will I probably try to unload this...in the future? Yes...
0380729407|2.0|I grew up reading Ray Bradbury (6th to 10th grades).  So now some twenty plus years later, in a nostalgic mood, I ordered a bunch of Bradbury books.  Something Wicked This Way Comes was the first book I chose to read and now I kind of wish I hadn't.<br />In this book, Bradbury writes shorter sentences than Hemingway.  And far too many of them contain exclamations such as: \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Oh gosh!\\"; \\"Dad!\\"; \\"It's hopeless!\\"; \\"Boys!\\"; \\"Like Heck!\\"; \\"Cheezeit!\\"; \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Jehosophat!\\"; \\"You're evil!\\"; \\"Jim!\\"; \\"Bangity-bang!\\"; and the best of all, \\"But for cri-yi, Jim, face it, you don't really want to be twenty!\\"<br />How about this for a sequence: <br />\\"No its all right!\\"<BR>\\"Jim!\\"<BR>\\"Will, yes, its ok!\\"<BR>\\"Stand back!\\"<BR>\\"This man is in a trance! As part of our new act I have hypnotized him!  He could suffer injury if you shocked him from the spell!\\"<BR>The internes shut their mouths.  The police stopped moving.<BR>\\"One hundred thousand volts!  Yet he will come forth alive, whole in sound mind and body!\\"<br />Now that's some writing.  Ed Wood himself couldn't have done that scene better.<br />All of this could be forgiven if there was an underlying story or even some characters worth knowing.  But alas...The protagonist, Will, is a wussy.  His father, Charles Halloway is dour old woman.  Will's best friend, Jim, has some guts, but to Will and his father he is far too brash.  The villains, such as they are, are not frightening or particularly villainous.  There is a dwarf, a witch, an illustrated man--not to mention Mr. Electro.  Oh my!<br />And what dastardly deeds come to light?  Why there is a carousel that can turn a young boy into an old man and vice versa!  Gasp!  There is a maze of mirrors that shows people their worst fears!  Shriek!  There is a freak show with the implication that carnival director Mr. Dark sculpted these freaks (pinhead, sheep boy, fire eater) from ordinary folks just like Will and Jim!<br />As Jim would say, \\"I think I'm going to bawl now!\\"<br/>You aren't missing much if you take a pass on this book.
B00004R9A4|5.0|Mary Poppins. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is one of the ultimate kid movies. Ride along on the magic bed with Eglantine, Charlie, Paul, Carrie and Prof. Emelius Brown in search of the spell for substitutiary locomotion, the ability to make inanimate objects come to life. The best thing about this DVD version is it is uncut and runs about 2 1/2 hrs. You can finally find out why Roddy McDowell's character is so shady! New songs mean new fun for viewers. This is definitely my favorite children's movie, first fiddle to my other favorite Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
B00003CXI1|4.0|When I read HP & the Sorcerer's Stone, I visualized, as best I could, many of the magical moments experienced by Harry. And I was eager to see what I had imagined on a big screen. For the most part, I was not disappointed.<BR>Chris Columbus -- of Home Alone fame -- directs an all-star cast of British greats, mixed with a load of cute kids who, though not perfect, are creditable in sharing their awe and excitement at the magical world unfolding before them. I especially enjoyed Maggie Smith as one of Harry's teachers at Hogwarts, a part that is anti-thetical to her role the same year in Gosford Park. It is fun to watch seasoned, serious Brits acting in roles less serious and stiff than their norm.<BR>What makes this film quite good is how well it was imagined. I am glad that the movie stays faithful to the book. What was in the book is what I wanted to see. Being able to WATCH a Quiddich match is itself worth the purchase price. Likewise for the life-sized-plus chess board. The visuals in the film are invigorating for someone who has read the book and dreamed about how these things would look.<BR>The movie's weakness, albeit minor, is the same as its strength. It moves rapidly from one important scene to the next. So much happens so quickly that if one is not familiar with the book and the extensive background it provides, there is a great chance he or she will not \\"get\\" this movie. For those who already know the story, the movie shows all the parts we wanted to see without spending much time explaining what is going on in Harry's head or flashing back to the past. <BR>Finally, I am still flabbergasted that people consider it necessarily to condemn this movie from a religious perspective. Apparently, this movie isn't for people who are too uptight, or those who take all literature too literally.
B00005JKJA|1.0|This was easily one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. But, it has it's good points. The acting is very good. Naomi Watts in my opinion should have been nominated for an Oscar. Her character transformation in this movie is incredible. This movie had me completely enthralled for about the first 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If ended differently, it could have been really great. But, then the box drops. Oh, that damned blue box. This is where Mr. Lynch's surrealistic ideas get into the way. It was probably about the point that the TV pilot ended and the real Lynch took over. And, what was with the love scenes? Who saw that coming? Did they make sense to anyone? I saw this movie months ago and have thought about it a lot since then, and still don't know what the heck was going on. Who is Who? What is What? Why is she there? Why, why, why... this is the prevailing theme of this movie. It led you down so many rabbit trails that never had an ending that poor Peter Rabbit is dead from exhaustion. Tripe. Pure, undiluted tripe. Don't waste your money like the academy wasted their Best Director Nomination. (To the expense of Baz Luhrmann.) Save your money and buy ANY OTHER movie that was made in 2001... you'll be glad that you did. Silencio.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Maybe you're like me and you own U2's best-known albums like The Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and All That You Can't Leave Behind, but just find them a little boring and don't listen to them all that much.  Your tastes are generally quite a bit left of U2.<br />If this sounds like you, you may really like Pop.  It's the one U2 album that I listen to consistently, because of its interesting textures and electronic influences.  Maybe I should have titled this review &quot;the U2 album for R.E.M. fans.&quot;
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever. It is also one of the greatest DVDs that you can own. If you are a fan of musicals, than you should love it. One word of advice... you MUST watch it to the end. The beginning can be hard to get through the first time, but with subsequent viewings it is all great. Kidman and McGregor capture you right away with their wonderful acting and voices. I cannot say enough about this movie. It is SO GOOD! It should have definitely taken home the Best Picture Oscar (although I really liked A Beautiful Mind.) Just buy it... I am sure you will be glad you did!
B00005JKED|4.0|Training Day is a stunning drama about the mean streets of L.A. Officer Hoyt (Hawke) is a young eager cop who joins the elite narc division in hopes of one day becoming detective. His &quot;training&quot; officer is Harris (Washington), a street savvy cop. The movie takes place in one entire day and as the day goes on, Hoyt begins to see that Harris is a different breed of cop. He gets the crooks allright, but he bends the rules and more than often crosses the line. <BR>This role is a departure from Washington's clean cut good guy image. Washington's character is a twisted, shrewd, and manipulative cop. There are also cameo performances from Dr.Dre and Snoop Dog. In my opinion, this movie was about LAPD's infamous Rampart division.
B00003CXAA|5.0|GODFATHER PART 1: The one that started it all. I can never decide which film I like better, the first or the second. At the end of the day, I decide that they're both great films and leave it at that. Here's the introduction to the world of the Corleone's and everything is just right. The actors are all in tune to their characters. The directing is top-notch, with many of the smaller details pulling us further into this world. The score is one of the best musical movie pieces of all-time, one that will always bring you back to this film, whenever it is heard. The pace is ideal, with three hours flying by like nothing, but most importantly, it's the story of these people that is absolutely fascinating and a pleasure to watch. Brando brooding over his disciples. Pacino deciding on what he should do with his life. Caan, the passionate brother who has anger hanging off the tip of his tongue. Cazale, the sap brother, who just wants to impress others and feel accepted. Everyone shines in this movie and takes it to the level of film that it is: an instant classic. See it and appreciate what a good movie can do to you. It can make you feel, it can make you cry, it can make you wince and above all...it can entertain you. And how about that final shot of Kay (Diane Keaton) looking into the room? Yipes...like I said...classic *****<BR>GODFATHER PART 2:  This film is yet another classic of American Cinema. Not only was Francis Ford Coppola able to re-connect the audience with the well-developed characters that he introduced us to in the first film, but he also takes it one step further, and gives us even more background on the man behind the entire family, Vito Corleone, but as a child first entering the country. And that is the secret of this second movie. There are two stories happening here, and they are told in parallel. On the one hand, we have Robert DeNiro, presenting us with the palpable sadness of Vito Corleone's early years in New York with his wife and kids. And on the other hand, we have Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, playing Vito's son all grown up and continuing where he left off in the first film), taking his empire to another level. The rise of the two men captures your attention once again in this amazing movie, filled with many graphic and memorable moments, all of which pull you further into its epic ambitions. I've always loved this movie as much as the first, and the truth is that they are just perfect together. This film completes the first movie, fills in some holes and gives you further insight into the loves, hates, passions and lives of these people. Once again, the performances are all top-notch here, with DeNiro winning an Oscar, despite saying very few English words during the entire movie. An impressive film that was able to balance two stories at the same time while keeping you entertained and engaged throughout. Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola and to everyone involved in the creation of this amazing sequel *****<br />GODFATHER PART 3: This movie wasn't as bad as I remembered it. In fact, I think it's because its predecessors were so great, that it really feels worse than it is. It's actually pretty good. There were however, certain things that \\"got to me\\" about this flick, most of which had to do with the acting. I didn't much care for Joe Mantegna in this movie. Not necessarily his character, but his acting, which I thought was a little over-the-top. I also thought the same of the chain-smoking priest, who I never really bought into. Sofia Coppola wasn't necessarily bad as her character was just \\"boring\\". I didn't really understand how a cool stud like Andy Garcia would go for a girl like that. And the fact that Duvall was nixed here, was a disgrace, in my opinion (and you replace him with George Hamilton, of all people?!?). Anyway, those are all small pet peeves of mine, I suppose. Overall, I did like the story, and even though the whole Vatican thing seemed a little far-fetched (although it turns out that itwas actually based on a true story), I was still quite riveted by the film, mostly because I liked all of the characters, and it was nice to see what had happened to them all, after all of these years. Very nostalgic and cozy. But what really made this movie for me was the amazing performance put forth by Andy Garcia. Wow! This dude torched some massive fire into this movie, and it was just what it needed. I was also glued to my set during the film's final 30 minutes, which Coppola has turned into amazing sequences in all three films, and seriously appreciated the thrilling moments within. And how about those two twin bodyguards!? Mingya! And most surprising of all, was the before last scene featuring the whole family coming out of the opera house, in which Coppola used silence to accentuate Michael's pain, and dude, it had me gulping with the missus, like you wouldn't believe. Very powerful, very sad and very touching, all at the same time. The final shot in the film is also another classic and a fitting way to finish the tale of a man who lost sight of what was most important to him over the years: love and family ****
B00003CXTG|3.0|There are 3 elements of interest in this movie : 1) the bombing of Pearl Harbor, 2) the romance and 3) the historic US retaliation of April 1942 : the first bombing raid over Japan.<BR>As far as history is concerned, \\"Tora, Tora, Tora !\\" (by R. Fleischer) is much more interesting to cover element 1).<BR>As to element 3), it's definitely much better to see \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\\" (by M. LeRoy) in which there's is quite a bit of romance too and an interesting description of the love relation between the airmen and their planes.<BR>\\"Pearl Harbor\\" may be more spectacular - and perhaps mostly more expensive - as the 2 movies mentioned here but  it certainly doesn't deserve to be remembered as much.
B000060MWU|1.0|First off, I agree with a previous review of this DVD.  It is a total sham.  I can't tell you how disgusted I was after purchasing this movie from Canada.<br />I am only giving this movie One star because it is atleast a DVD, although it seems more like a VHS transferred onto DVD.<br />There are no improvements at all.  The colors are appauling at best.  The image and sound of this movie are so poor that I nearly through this movie in the garbage.  They totally Lost this one.  I am embarresed for David Lynch.  Everytime I want to show this movie to my friends I instead rent the VHS.  With a little luck I can get a decent VHS copy that is Widescreen and not totally jacked up.<br />David Lynch is one of the most icnredible director's out there and I am so surprised that all of his movies are still not available.  Mulholland Dr. comes out very soon and still no mention of Eraser Head, Lost Highway, or Wild at Heart.  Take a note Distribution companies...The true Lynch masterpieces are still waiting for the DVD treatment.
B000063CPL|5.0|From the opening it brought back the memories of seeing them on this tour in San Diego, CA and Irvine, CA. From the opening of THE WICKER MAN to the finale of RUN TO THE HILLS this cd is a must have for any MAIDEN fan. It was great to hear Bruce do versions of SIGN OF THE CROSS and THE CLANSMAN, much better than Blaze Bayley. There is 6 songs from the BRAVE NEW WORLD cd which are brilliantly done. They didn't forget the classics and they are done very well with Adrian, Janick, & Dave on guitars. The recording of this cd is very well done, the best since Live After Death. I didn't think the recording of A Real Live Dead One or Live at Donington were that great so it was good to hear the recording back to greatness, Kevin Shirley must have had a lot to do with the producing. If I can recommend one cd to by that has just been released, this would be it. I can't wait for them to come out with a new album.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. Period. it's is simply brilliant, well-acted, and makes you actually think...my friend and I have had discussion and can't find discrepancies in it yet. It's a little confusing the first time you see it, but you are left with that feeling of catharsis and it is entirely worth it! Definately a must see!!
B00000K413|5.0|The Hurting is not another 80's cd that will make you feel good with upbeat songs and lyrics. The feel of this album is quite melancholy and depressing to say the least and you have to have an aquired taste for Tears For Fears to truly appreciate it. Despite not being as popular as the more mainstream &quot; Songs from the Big Chair&quot; that proceeded this album, I feel that lyricly, the album outdoes &quot; Big Chair&quot; in some respects and the songs are very catchy.Also, This is a must have for anyone who enjoys music themed on pain and suffering and teen/ childhood angst. If you want a superbly great 80's cd that's NOT irritatingly happy and overwhelmingly &quot;pop&quot;, then I highly recommend this one.  The lyrics are poetic and beautiful.
0446677450|1.0|It's all in the packaging.  The author even admitted that he wasn't a very good writer, but knew how to sell a product.  He gave an example of another book which sold millions because it had a provocative title.  I find this out halfway through this book with a provocative title!  In other words, I just helped him make more money, but I learned nothing.  Do not waste your money on this book.
B00000JR29|5.0|It's a classic effort that should be in everyone's music collection. I seriously don't believe it is possible for someone to NOT like something on this cd. Pay attention to the very underrated &quot;Listen&quot; and the soft humming of the piano in the masterful &quot;I believe&quot; This cd is for everyone and it is the best TFF cd and in my opinion the best cd of the 80's.
B000000WA4|5.0|There are about 366 other reviews for this album here, and most of them, it seems, have also given it the old five stars.  So I'll keep this one nice and short and sweet and to the point:<br />The Smashing Pumpkins' epic Mellon Collie and the Infinate Sadness is one of the greatest rock albums ever.  You should definately buy it.  <br />Now, admittedly, it runs out of steam a little towards the end, but that still leaves about 24 fantastic tracks to listen to, enjoy, and eventually fall in love with.  I really wish people would stop whining about how long it is.
B000002MJC|4.0|This is a highly transitional album for DM. It has a more mainstream feel to it and has some very unique tracks to it such as the almost gospel sounding &quot;Condemnation&quot; and my ultimate favorite DM song &quot;One Caress&quot;, which has Martin Gore singing against the background of an orchestra. Each track is a unique work and though the tone is a bit gloomy and the sound is different, it is still classic DM and a very good album.
0618135871|2.0|The last few years have seen a sudden resurgence in Philip Roth's literary reputation as he has come forth with some markedly original work, especially his masterpiece THE HUMAN STAIN. But his newest novella, THE DYING ANIMAL,  seems a step back in the old direction, and seems a recycling of his old themes from his Seventies and Sixties fiction. Once again, an impossibly horny writer and academic living in the New York area uses women for sex with little regard to their feelings or to their existence outside of himself as human beings in their own right. Certainly the novella is concerned with understanding--and even critiquing--Kepesh's ethical positions, but isn't this just all more of the same from Roth? The sexagenarian Kepesh is so morally repulsive that it's hard to want to spend much time with him, and his situation (he not only attracts much, much, much younger women, but seems unable to beat them off with a stick) seems a bit fantastic. Roth has dipped too many times from the same well--and it's become more than a bit embarrassing.
B000001DYY|3.0|I think that Roland Orzabal is an amazing singer/songwriter but he seems to have lost his focus with this album. The songs are kind of weird in my opinion (&quot;Dog's a best friend's dog&quot;?)and the sound is lacking from the days of classic TFF in the 80's. &quot;Cold&quot;, and &quot;Fish out of water&quot; are great songs and the album DOES grow on you after a while but it is quite unispired compared to past efforts ( I am a diehard TFF fan but I must admit this )Maybe I feel this way because all of the delightful melancholy and cynicism that was the forefront of &quot;The Hurting&quot; and &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; simply isn't there; in fact there isn't really ANY theme to this album really. It's a good cd to have if you're a serious fan of Roland Orzabal but don't expect too much out of this one.
B000063CPL|5.0|One of my favorite maiden songs and also one of my favorite songs of all time is on this album.  Blood brothers is the name.  This a great live cd.  Contains several songs from their latest album, Brave New World.  Also contains some from various other albums, including Number Of The Beast.  <br />This cd is produced very good and the crowd never gets tired of maiden and iron maiden never gets tired of the crowd.  this gives the live cd a very energitic feel to it.  It features the 21st Century lineup of maiden, the same as on Brave New World.  Although there could had been more songs, it is still a great song selection so i'm not going to complain.  <br />Each disk also includes a video:  Disk One is the song Brave New World done live from the concert and Disk Two has a video called A Day In The Life which is about Iron Maiden.  Shows footage of them before the concert and stuff. Really interesting and funny too.<br />All in all, a geat buy.  All the songs are really good but my favorites are: The Wicker Man, Wrathchild, Blood Brothers, The Trooper, Dream of Mirrors, Run To The Hills, and Hallowed Be Thy Name.<br />This cd contains 19 songs but only 18 of them are actual songs.  Song one on the first disk is just an intro but it is a fine intro which is a first because a lot of intros [stink].  But this one doesn't.  It's so good it might as well be a song.  <br />UP THE IRONS!
B000000WZ4|4.0|I think when this album was made, the band was trying to follow the trend of popular alternative music at the time. the track \\"Barrel of a gun\\" barely resembles the band's sound if it's recognizable at all. I don't like \\"Barrel..\\" but there are some awesome songs such as the experimental \\"Freestate\\", which reminds me of spain for some unknown reason and \\"Sister of Night\\" is a wonderful ballad that is deeply felt. It's apparent that this album was made to try to attract a more alternative crowd but the cd has something to please everyone.<br /> At a glance:<BR>Best song:( Tough one this time... )...Freestate<BR>Least favorite: Barrel of a Gun<BR>Overall:<BR>1. Barrel of a Gun: It's obvious that DM was trying a bit too hard to win the hard core, alternative audience with this one. Too bad it just doesn't fit into the album very well; which is good because if the album totally sounded like this, it would've been very very bad 4/10.<BR>2. The love thieves: Soft, a bit sensual ( in my opinion ), and thoughtful. This song is like an ' Exciter \\" preview of what would follow this album. I like it. You will too if you like the softer DM ballads along side your basic DM sound 8/10.<BR>3. Home: When Martin Gore takes the Mic, always know that it's a ballad and it will either be sad or romantic or both. This is a little of both 8/10.<BR>4. It's no good: The very first DM song that I ever heard when I lusted over Dave in the music video. I was paying more attention to him than the song but I heard enough to inquire into the band's music and the rest is history. Very modern for those who shy away from the 80's sounding stuff 7/10.<BR>5.<BR>6. Useless: An anrgy song that is a little reminissant of \\" Barrel of a Gun\\" but this one sounds better since Dave is actually singing and not taunting his words. A great song to put on when you're in a bad mood and you feel like de-stressing without violence. Sing this one and I guarantee you'll at least feel a tiny bit better if you're mad atsomeone 6/10.<BR>7. Sister of Night: One of the best songs on the album. Great beat, great imagery through lyrics, and the instruments used create beautiful sounds that remind me of \\" waiting for the Night\\" from Violator 8/10.<BR>8.<BR>9. Freestate: A unique creation that reminds me of the color red and Spanish imagery. I would dance with a partner to this song in a red and black dress at a bull fight ( if that makes any sense ).It's slower than what I usually hold as criteria for a really great DM song and it is by far, a one-of-a kind, but it is strangely beautiful and surprisingly dancible 9/10.<BR>10. The bottom Line: This has the most romantic lyrics of all the songs on the cd. I wish I had written this song; it's just so well written and beautiful but musicly, it tends to get old after listening to it a few times. Still, a good song, not great but good 6/10.<BR>11. Insight: A nice ending song for this album. Lot's of imagery on this album and this one reminds me of flying or \\" taking off \\" in life by making decisions that will alter it. It's a nice change of pace after listening to \\" The bottom Line\\"; which is also pretty slow ( notice a pattern here? ). One of the stronger songs on the album. Interesting extra instrumental track that comes far after this...8/10.
B000002LCB|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with a wonderful soundtrack.  THe ups and downs are captured perfectly.  The best part of it is Storybook love by Willy DeVille.  Just a beautiful song, so beautiful in fact that we will be using it at our July wedding:)
B00000JR2A|4.0|When I first heard this cd, I was slightly disappointed. Their sound is quite different than on &quot; Songs from the Big Chair&quot;, but if you like Roland Orzabal in general, you'll still be pleased with this. It's much mellower and not as depressing as the other albums that came out before this one. Just don't expect something sounding similar to the older Tears for Fears that came out with &quot; Shout&quot; and &quot; Everybody wants to rule the world&quot;. This is nothing like it but Rolands angelic voice has never sounded better and &quot; Sowing the seeds of love&quot; is a great song along with most of the others on this cd.
B000001FI7|4.0|This is the one Trip-hop cd you should own. The engineering/production is great. The kick drums  on \\"Mysterons\\" and \\"sour times\\" rock harder than the 808's on most rap cd's.  \\"Breathe \\" sounds like \\"Nothing Compare 2 U' by Sinead O'Connor.  The scratching on \\"Wandering Stars\\" is the weirdest I have ever heard. Beth's Singing is pretty good too. On some cuts she sounds like Billie holiday .Some cuts she sounds like Sinead O'connor . (These are just points of comparison I use for convenience .)The main thing is this cd is totally fresh even though a lot of bands have ripped off the sound...
B000002L75|5.0|This is yet another superb DM album that is unique because it is a transition between the sound of their first three albums that was more light and boppy and the darker signature sound that they would become famous for. &quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot; a beautiful song about life's unfairness and why things turn out the way they do. This is my third favorite DM album only behind Black Celebration and Violator.
B000001E7V|4.0|Tricky has been coasting for years off this cd.  Thing is ,this cd is good enought to make it possible. There are good spots on all his other cds,songs like,\\"she makes me wanna die\\" ,\\"Broken homes\\" , \\"christiansands\\"  , but this cd has the most good stuff relative to bad stuff. Even then it has weak spots.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Just a warning to all that may be looking for more songs from the \\" Black Celebration\\" era, don't look towards this one. This is by far the band's mellowest, slowest, most mature album to date, yet, with that being said, it still manages to keep that unique DM feel to it. by the way, Did I mention it was very romantic?n Love is a big theme here so if you don't like those kinds of songs, don't say I didn't warn you. If you don't like all the dance beats and synthesizer-based rhythm's of past Depeche Mode albums/songs, I think that this would be the album for you. It is smooth and relaxing and it's central theme is based on love with sensual ballads such as \\"When the Body speaks\\" and \\"Freelove\\" and \\"I am you\\". <br />When I heard about this cd coming out, I was a bit nervous because afterall, they've been around for twenty years now and their previous two albums were dark attepts of conquering mainstream success. This album is by far, their best since their realease of Violator, twelve years ago. The more adult-like feel of the album should open up a whole new genre of Mode-fans while still pleasing the old one's.<br />My favorite songs would have to be \\"Shine\\" and the very tranquil \\"Comatose\\". This cd is best for older, more mature music lovers ( aside from DM fans in general ) If you never liked the signature sounds of DM in the 80's and early 90's, this album may win you over as a fan. Don't be afraid of this one for the mature sound. Despite all this, it still manages to keep it's Depeche Mode familiarity to it.<BR> My Insights:<BR>Best song: Freelove<BR>Least favorite song: Breathe<BR>Overall:<BR>1. Dream On: You don't usually hear a lot of guitar from Depeche Mode ( obviously since they use synthesizers! ) so this song is interesting in that respect. It's got a nice pace, and it's upbeat. It's a good way to begin the album singing: \\" Can you feel a little love?\\" 8/10.<BR>2. The Sweetest condition: This one is catchy and similar to \\" shine\\" but not as good. Not astandout track and a little dull and simplistic but it grows on you over time 6/10.<BR>3. Shine: It's hard to describe this song really besides saying that it's not as sweet and love-based as all the rest but it's still lusty. Faster, and I like to sing along to this one the most 8/10.<BR>4.When the Body speaks: Wow. More guitar-like sounds and I'm lovin' it. You'll love it too. Play it for your date when you cook dinner and light candles and all that other mushy stuff. This song is beautiful and eloquent 8/10.<BR>5. The Dead of Night: This was a bit risky in my opinion, all this soft, sensuous stuff that will make you smile then a harder, dark song about sleazy men who take advantage of youger \\" easy\\" girls and then deny it ( Hey, is this song about rape? ). Yes, THAT is risky for the type of album this is otherwise but the music makes it work. It's a nice little break from the soft tranquility that you feel throughout the cd and I even found myself happily singing along to the chorous. The guilty pleasure song of the album 7/10.<BR>6. Lovetheme: I consider this like a prelude to freelove and shouldn't've been a whole named track in it's own right 5/10.<BR>7. Freelove: Usually Martin sings the best love songs for DM so I was so pleased to hear Dave's voice for this one because it is the best on the cd. Just listen to it and you'll like it yourself 9/10.<BR>8. Comatose: This song is so somple and subtle and brooding that most would consider it filler material. Think again. The title suits the song 9/10.<BR>9. I feel loved: The dance track of the album. Most will like this song even when they don't like the rest of it. since great DM songs are usually dance tracks. If you hate the slowed down pace then this song will be your saving grace along with \\" The dead of night\\". I find it a bit out of place myself but It's tolerable though I must admit, the remixes on it's single are better 5/10.<BR>10. Breathe: I found this song a bit disappointing especially since Martin sang it. The song lacks any depth musicly and lyricly. It's usually the song that I choose to skip on the cd 4/10.
B00005JKED|4.0|Denzel Washington gives the performance of a lifetime in \\"Training Day,\\" a wildy hip cop movie that starts off like a house on fire, and, for the most part, never lets up.<br />Washington is Alonzo Harris, the head of an elite Los Angeles narcotics squad.  With his leather jacket, garish jewlery, and some of the sharpest dialouge this side of \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" he's part Harry Callahan, part Popeye Doyle, and part John Shaft.<br />Harris tells his rookie partner for the day, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke in a terrific performance), the \\"only way to protect the sheep from the wolves is to catch the wolves..and the only way to catch a wolf is to become a wolf,\\" a philosophy which probably has more relevance these days to the war of terrorism than it does to the war on drugs.<br />To give away more of the plot would be unfair; suffice it to say that \\"Training Day\\" is a sharp, funny, profane, and violent film that, under the direction of Antoine Fuquia, captures the feel of Los Angeles street life.<br />The supporting performances from rap stars Snoop Dog (as a wheelchair bound crack dealer) and Dr. Dre (a member of Washington's elite squad) are superb and singer Macy Gray is so alive in her cameo, she practically jumps off the screen; veteran character actor Harris Yulin as the head of an upscale LA Burglary Division, relates an incredibly hilarious story of how a low life thief beats a jail sentence, and it's one of the highlights of the film.<P....<br />*****<br />DVD package is superb..includes a \\"making of\\" documentary; a series of deleted scenes (one, in which Washginton flirts with a couple of attractive Hispanic girls in the street, should have been left in the final cut), theatrical trailer, and 2 music videos.
B000002LCI|4.0|This is another DM cd with a lot of big hits on it such as &quot;Never let me down again&quot; and &quot;Strangelove&quot;. I don't think it's the best Depeche Mode cd but it is definately one that you'll enjoy if you are familiar with the band.
B00000JGOH|1.0|I'm wholly dedicated to Saving Private Ryan- it's seriously THE best film I have EVER seen. I was positively livid that anything could beat SPR. \\"But,\\" I told myself. \\"You haven't seen Shakespeare in Love. It might be really good. It looks kind of interesting and it's supposed to be incredibly witty.\\" So I rented it. I could barely sit through it. Am I supposed to care that Viola (or whatever her name is) wants to be an actress? Am I supposed to believe that Shakespeare seriously behaved like such an imbessillic dimwit? A moving love story? You've got to be kidding! Will: \\"Oh, she's so gorgeous! I'm in love!\\"  Viola: \\" Oh, isn't Master Shakespeare soo handsome?\\" They fell head over heels before they even knew each other. They had absolutely noo presence of mind. I seriously could barely sit through it! It goes on my worst movies list along with The Lost World, Jurassic Park 3, On the Line, and Bounce- all of which you would do best to avoid. Aside from the strained accent, Gwyneth Paltrow's performance was good, but Judi Dench? Supporting actress? She had like two scenes! Personally I don't think that justifies an Oscar win. In 15 years Saving Private Ryan will still be hailed as one of the greatest war films, any film, of all time, while Shakespeare in Love will be gathering dust along with Titanic. Don't waste your time. See SPR, or if you already have, see it again before this!
B000002LK1|5.0|Okay, so it only has nine songs on it but would you rather have an album chock full of lackluster efforts or a shorter album that has nothing but absolute masterpieces? This is DM at it's finest. Need proof? &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;Policy of Truth&quot;, and &quot;Enjoy the silence&quot;...enough said. The only question in my mind is which is better? Violator or Black Celebration? Both albums mark the beginning and end of what I like to call &quot;the golden era&quot; of DM from 1986 to 1990 where they had all of their biggest hits, best albums and created their signature sound. All of the songs on this cd are highly intense and very danceable.
B00004WG2X|3.0|I viewed this version after the lavish Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle adaption and even taking into account that it is 10 to 15 years older, I still found it inferior.  I agree with the previous reviewer that at times it looks like it was filmed in someone's basement.  All the actors seem to rush through their lines and some seemed to be just reading through them for all the lack of emotion put into them. David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy was just too stone-like for my tastes.  Elizabeth Garvie was extremely good in this version, however.  <br />I highly advise you to check out the newer A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Ehle is not as likable as Garvie but Firth's Mr. Darcy makes you forget that.
B000002L9M|5.0|No DM song has quite the dramatic opening as Black Celebration does. <BR>Where at first you strain to hear the sounds of a baby crying and mechanical voice in the distance echoing into the sound of a simple keyboard riff, where one sound layers into and builds off of another as David Gahan opens the song in his impressively deep baritone singing \\"let's have a black celebration,.. black celebration...tonight. To celebrate the fact that we've seen the back of another black, day..\\". Then suddenly the mystery unfolds into a fast paced, somewhat dark dance melody in which you can hear every layer of sound; including those creepy echoes and the minimalist keyboard riffs from the beginning. AWESOME way to start a song--as well as an album for that matter and the progression from 'Black Celebration' into 'Fly on the windscreen' is perfect, as you delve into darker, even more nihilistic territory.<br />The dilema is: All of these songs are phenominal, I will not waste too much time restating what has already been said in other reviews. BUT most DM songs usually ARE very well done. So, What makes this album stand a cut above other Masterpiece albums like 'Violator' and 'Music for the Masses'??<br />I think what makes Black Celebration outshine all other DM albums( which are all VERY good ) in my opinion is that the band was very organized in  projecting their vision on this album. Indeed, the album does have it's share of different types of songs from the moody, church-choir sounding 'Sometimes' to the ultra-experimental sounding dance classic, 'A Question of Time' and finally to the softer toned, melancholy love ballad, 'A Question of Lust'. All of these songs are quite different and yet once you listen to them, and all the other tracks on this cd, you know that they were meant to be on the same album. No, they don't sing about the same subject in every song but you do get a sense that the overall meaning is the same, which strengthens the album because you are more likely to enjoy something you have a better understanding of, rather than a collage of several different views and ideas that contradict eachother and leave you pondering just what they band was trying to convey. <br />The overall message is this: Life is beyond our control, and death is inevitable, so we must live life to it's fullest( ideals,obsession,love,sex ) and experience whatever we can out of it and cherish it before it's too late.<br />Yes, it's a somewhat bleak outlook but THAT is what makes this album darker( gothic?? ) than all the others. There are no bad songs on this album and the variation will always keep it interesting; even after repeated plays. And, moreso than any other DM album, this one just might make you think.<BR>It also happens to be my favorite album of all time with 'Black Celebration' being my favorite song of all time. Don't believe the garbage being said about synth-pop music not being of any substance, buy this cd and listen for yourself.
B00005MP58|5.0|After seeing the movie adaptions for Sense and Sensiblity and Emma, I was anxious to see if this adaption of Pride and Prejudice was just as delightful. I was not disappointed!  Everybody is perfectly cast and the costumes and settings were gorgeous. Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennet was cheeky and witty.  Allison Steadman was hilarious as Mrs. Bennet.  Colin Firth was the PERFECT Mr. Darcy--very proud and somewhat standoffish at first, but extremely dreamy. <br />Altogether perfect and well worth the whole afternoon in front of the TV!
0446608955|5.0|Have you ever read a book that made you want to fall in love? With a Walk To Remember, maybe you just might. This book is very heart warming and makes you believe in faith. I thought it was going to be a corny book, but I was so wrong. It makes you believe that true love really does exist. When Landon says, &quot;I would have married Jamie Sullivan even if my miracle had come true.&quot;, it makes you wish that his miracle would have happened. I recommend this book anyone and everyone.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I first watched Mayer on an MTV special while late night channel surfing. I, being a teenage girl, first noticed how cute John is! I sat through show and fell in love with his songs. My fav song on the album, &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot;, is the story of my life! I bought the album and left it in my cd player for months. Every song on it is catchy! I can't wait for another album to roll out.
B00003W8NM|4.0|I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  I originally didn't want to see it when it first came out.  Like everyone else, I thought it was about the eponymous &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  It's not, really.  It's about a man who feels disenfranchised -- he finds no satisfaction from his job, his possessions, his general life.  He is an insomniac who is addicted to self-help groups, even of those for which he does not suffer.  Eventually, he get himself involved in something that evolves beyond his original intention and finds himself in way over his head... with surprising results.

1573226521|4.0|This book shows very loose reminisence to the movie but is one of the best works I've read coming from a author of his first book. If you love adventure, and searching for somthing exciting, then you would love to read this. It was tantalizing, a natural page turner, reviting at points. It's amazing what this book can do to a person.

0780626494|5.0|...O.k., I know, that's a really stupid title, but I can't think of any other way to explain how this movie makes me feel.  I am \\"slightly older\\" than the main characters, but really appreciate their on screen warmth.  I love this movie because it makes me laugh without vulgarity and it's sexy without a hint of nudity or even suggested intimacy.  I guess it's a Doris Day and Rock Hudson type of comedy.  I bought the DVD to relive the \\"warm and fuzzy\\" feeling whenever I want!
0790729644|5.0|There is no good and there is no bad in this movie. Compared to the great old westerns like Rio Bravo, this is completely different kind of a beast. There are no completely good characters and there are no completely bad characters in this film. Everything is grey. The movie is great ending to Eastwood's western roles. If I could ask one thing from mr Eastwood, that would be 'no more westerns, the Unforgiven was perfect'. I must say that this movie is not the best western - no - this is the best movie ever.<br />When I first saw this movie this was the first role I saw Morgan Freeman at after 'Robin Hood', after many succesfull movies I still consider this his best performance. As with mr. Eastwood, the role comparable only with the one in 'In the Line of Fire'. Gene Hackman in the role of the sadistic sheriff Little Bill makes the best performance that he has made on his long and succesfull career. To today their performance seems to last, great work indeed. As well as Eastwoods directing, well, maybe it suffices to say that he won the best picture and best directing Academy Award for the picture. What is shame, is that the he didn't get recoqnition of the acting performance, which was, to my opinion, best there has been.<br />In risking sounding chauvinistic, this is a man's movie. In saying of this I don't mean that a woman could not like this movie or even love it, I just feel that it appeals to men much more than women. There are no central roles for women in this movie. Though the women are in the midst of the actions of the movie, they are the driving force that make this movie to happen.
B00005ATQI|3.0|When I think of a horror movie, I think of a film that is going to scare me in some way. There doesn't have to be any gore involved, no actual acts of violence need to be shown (the greatest horror directors know that less is more), and I usually am startled at least a couple of times. I didn't find THE SHINING to be a scary movie. At times it was disturbing, but it really never was scary.<br /><br />The movie stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a writer who is hired to be the winter caretaker of a huge hotel in Colorado. The hotel, the Overlook, is over twenty-five miles away from any inhabitants and is in such a secluded area that the place is virtually cut off from the rest of the world during the winter. Jack moves his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel with him. Danny has a type of ESP that he learns from the hotel's cook is called the shining. The shining allows him to see events from the past and foresee events in the future and speak into other shiners minds. Danny's gift warns him that the hotel is full of evil and is haunted by ghosts, but even Danny's mother doesn't really listen to Danny until he starts chanting &#34;redrum&#34; in a strange voice. By, then Jack is a total psycho and wants to live up to the ghostly Joneses and butcher his family just like the ghosts that haunt the hotel.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is usually always a joy to watch and THE SHINING is no exception. His portrayal of a man driven mad by alcoholism, mistakes from the past, cabin fever, and a haunted hotel is riveting. Shelley Duvall pulls of a remarkable job of a wife blinded by false hope to all signs of trouble until it is almost too late. And Danny Lloyd is a delight to watch as the young boy blessed with a gift to powerful to control.<br /><br />Kubrick may have been satirizing the horror genre in this film. Or maybe he wanted to make an &#34;artful&#34; horror movie. I'm not really sure. However, outside of a few disturbing scenes (e.g. the lady in the bathtub), THE SHINING isn't scary. It doesn't cause one to think; it doesn't really examine the nature of evil; and outside of a few famous lines (heeeeere's Johnny) is forgettable. The movie was just plain strange and weird in a very bizarre way. It reminded me of a Coen Brothers picture, but without much taste or class. I don't really know what the big deal is about, but unless you're a huge Kubrick, King, or movie fan I really wouldn't recommend THE SHINING. It's rather dull.(e.g. the lady in the bathtub), THE SHINING isn't scary.

0812550706|5.0|I looked at Ender's Game dauntingly. Not because it is overly thick, but I had never really read a ton of scifi. Then I started it as a school book and couldn't put it down.<BR>Ender'sgame is about a boy named Ender, his trip to a \\"Battle School\\" in a time where Earth is shadowed by the threat of an alien race called Buggers. Ender and other highly gifted children are being brought to Battle School in hopes of fostering new millitary leaders. The story is an emotional overload, exploring the ideas of human nature, ethics, child vs. adult, and so much more. Card's genius pulls you along slowly until you explode into the ending. Then you pick up the book to read it again.<BR>An absolute must read for anyone, even those who have not had a pleasent experience in scifi. Card wrote that he wanted Ender's Game to be accessible to any reader, and it is.<BR>In for the book you'll never be able to put down? Then Ender's Game is for you!
B00005JKYS|5.0|THIS MOVIE MOVED ME TO TEARS, I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW REALLISTIC IT WAS. IF YOU WEREN'T PATRIOTIC WHEN YOU ENTERED THE THEATER, YOU WERE WHEN YOU LEFT. MY HUSBAND JOHN MORRIS LIVED THE SAME ERA THAT THE MOVIE WAS BASED ON. HE FLEW MEDIVAC DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT. HE DIDN'T FEEL AS IF HE COULD GO AND SEE THE MOVIE SO I WENT ALONE. WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I WAS STILL IN TEARS AND SPEECHLESS. I CONSIDER MYSELF A PATRIOTIC PERSON, BUT HAVE NEVER VIEWED A FILM THAT MOVED ME LIKE THIS ONE DID. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID \\"I DON'T SEE HOW ANY OF THE MEN THAT EXPERIENCED THE VIETNAM CONFLICT COULD EVER COME HOME SANE AND IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY SAW AND HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE.\\" THEN THE WAY THEY WERE TREATED WHEN THEY RETURNED HOME TO A COUNTRY THEY DEFENDED WITH THEIR LIVES. THEY LITERALLY WENT FROM HAND TO HAND COMBAT TO THE ARMS OF THEIR LOVED ONES IN A MATTER OF 48/72 HOURS, IMAGINE THAT.  WHAT A TRADEGY THAT WE AS AMERICANS COULD TREAT THESE YOUNG 18 & 19 YR OLD MEN WITH SUCH UNJUSTICE AND MAKE THEM FEEL ASHAMED OF WHAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT SENT THEM TO VIETNAM TO DO. THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU APPRECIATE THESE VIETNAM VETS MORE THAN EVER. IT WAS NOT FAIR TO THEM WHAT THEY HAD TO FACE OVER THERE. THEY DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR OR WHO THEY WERE FIGHTING, NEVER KNOWING WHO THE ENEMY REALLY WAS. MEL GIBSON WAS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR THE MAIN CHARACTER, HE PLAYED THE PART PERFECTLY.  I HOPE IT HAS MOVED HIM AS MUCH AS IT DID ME.
B000063CPL|4.0|well maiden seems to enjoy putting out live albums. in the last decade there was 3 different live releases. but those live albums(real live one, real dead one, and donnington) were really lacklustre affairs. they sound like they are going throught the motions on those(and giving dickinson's interest at that point it would appear that is just the case). so what about this one. more perfunctory runthrus of the same ole same ole. not so in this case. they haven't sounded this good live since live after death. and while this album does not eclipse that one(what could?) it is still satisfying nonetheless. this was recorded at the massive rock inrio festival in brazil and the song selection is the set list from their brave new world tour. it is the new stuff that makes this worth getting. sign of the cross, the clansman, and dream of mirrors are highlights here. it has the usual live stuff on it as well(i know what your thinking,'not hallowed be thy name again live'\\".the 2 cds also have enhanced multimedia stuff on it as well, which is pretty cool. a must for any diehard maiden fan.
B00005RY7X|3.0|This one is very confusing.  Everything about it sounds wrong.  To me it sounds like Lemmy from Motorhead singing on Cheap Trick's terrible late 80's album \\"The Doctor\\" with lyrics written by a Swedish person who REALLY likes Sammy Hagar with the producer of David Johansen's \\"Sweet Revenge\\".  Kind of like if Devo wanted to be Van Halen.  I first bought it and after 30 seconds hated it.  But then I played it again and after 3 songs decided it was the stupidest album I had ever heard.  But then I listened to it all the way through.  And now, having listened to it several times have come to this conclusion:  \\"I Get Wet\\" IS the STUPIDEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!  The song titles are hilarious.  The singing is hilarious.  The lyrics are hilarious.  The music is hilarious.  And yet I really like it.  The more I listen, the more I can't get enough of it.  \\"Ready to Die\\" is SUPER catchy.  So, my advice is to give it a few listens, and you will be away from it and find yourself wanting more.  What is up with that?
0962477060|5.0|I wish I had found this book when I started playing the guitar 20 years ago.  I would be a much better guitar player today.  Why?...Because I would have known why the guitar fretboard is designed the way it is much earlier.  This book cuts out all of the fluff and gets right to the point.  You will not find a better guitar instruction book anywhere.<br />I would also recommend the Fretboard Logic III for the rest of the story...
0156012197|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a sincere, imaginative story, full of memorable situations and characters. It is a simple children's story, with a fundamental message that is simple and timeless. For me that message is: be loyal to yourself and those you love, and don't allow yourself to become corrupted by \\"adult\\" concerns (greed, lust, power, conformity). Of course, the book is open to interpretation and elaboration, which is part of what makes it so wonderful.<br />Now, about those translations..<br />I don't believe, like some here do, that the new translation is as devastating a fiasco as New Coke. Both translations are flawed. <br />Katherine Woods writes with such lyrical prose, she can't help but bring out the haunting beauty of the story. Many of her well chosen phrases perfectly convey the gravity of events, and the heartbreaking loveliness of the title character. Ultimately, though, the book was written for children, and I know few children who can genuinely appreciate her writing style. Some adults may think differently, but, really, how many children would know what an 'abode' is, or understand passages such as \\"I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems\\"? Be honest.<br />The new translation overcorrects this problem, though. True to Antoine De Saint-Exupery's intentions, it aims itself more squarely at children. Unfortunately, in the end it comes accross as too informal, lacking much of the poetic depth found in the original and the first translation. However, it does fix some errors that were probably due to sloppiness (speedy translation, I guess?) and should have been fixed by now, and the restored illustrations are an improvement. The power of the story holds up, despite the language being \\"dumbed down\\" a good bit.<br />My solution is this: if you are an adult reading for the first time, or loved the first translation, skip the new one. If you are wanting to read the story to your child, buy the new translation and get a copy of the old as well. Read the new one to your child now, and graduate them to the old one when they can get through it without the constant use of a dictionary. I think they will get more out of the story without being held back by complex prose, and if you read it to them, hey, you can always embellish by transposing some of Woods's interpretations. <br />Best of all would be to encourage them to learn French so that they could read the original version, which remains both poetic and accessible - a book worthy of the highest praise.
B000002UEB|5.0|As I was watching the DVD of this album which I had first listened maybe 10 or more years ago, I felt the urge to need to share my thoughts with the reader. This album is the kind that makes me feel, as if I am the only one, on the whole planet to understand the thought behind the music. <BR>All the songs are so emotional and filled with melody. The technicality is superb. It seems that each and every solo and/or riff etc.. is studied upon. I really do feel sorry for the today's youth for what they are missing. I hope this and similar reviews bring the curiosity to a some lonely folk out there and make him/her that he's not the only one.
0446677450|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki does an excellent job of raising our financial awareness- challenging us to examine the very way we think about &quot;getting ahead&quot;.  Working harder at a j.o.b. is NOT the answer, and I found his reasoning to be very sound.  Basic concepts like understanding the difference between an asset and a liability, and the difference between money working for me- and me working for money, have opened my eyes to the false paradigm I USED to prescribe to.<BR>This book is a must for anyone who desires real financial freedom.  I'm grateful to Robert for sharing his wisdom, and grateful for the friend who recommended the book!
B000002J1B|5.0|Before Relayer came out, it was rumoured that Yes were planning to return to a more basic rock form after all the hectic processes involved in producing Tales. They were wrong !! Relayer was undeniably a step higher from what Tales had achieved.<br />Wakeman's departure, in retrospect, must have been a blessing in disguise. Fans often overlooked the fact that Moraz had a wide spectrum of musical influences, which includes jazz and 20th century music, which surely had injected a more progressive feel in the real sense. However, Moraz was called in when almost 80% of the material had been written and acted almost as merely a session filler. But just listen to his delicate passages on Gates, and his daring synth solo on Sound Chaser. Adding to that, Moraz had been more willing to explore new possibilities with synthesizer sounds of that time - thus adding a more futuristic touch <br />For new prog-rock keyboardists, this album is highly recommended, and stands up high along with other prog-rock keyboard masterpieces such as Close To The Edge (Rick Wakeman), Brain Salad Surgery (Keith Emerson) or UK's first album (Eddie Jobson).
B00005UKKF|5.0|Britney Spears has always been one of my favourite performers.  Her albums are always so funky, her videos are always so ... and she always puts so much energy into her performances.  Okay, so she may lip-sync every now and then, but that's not to say she isn't a damn good entertainer, and this DVD proves it.  Singing all of her hits and the best bits of her albums, Britney's Las Vegas Show is a tour de force and is sooooo much more than your average concert, it's a show.<br />She opens with former No.1 single \\"OOPS I DID IT AGAIN\\", tied to a spinning wheel she rotates for the first verse, before coming on to the large stage to finish.  She follows it up with (YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY,....  OVERPROTECTED follows.  Dressed in a very ... catsuit-type attire she puts plenty of oomph into one of the freshest and funkiest tunes of the show.  Next is the enjoyable medley of BORN TO MAKE YOU HAPPY / LUCKY / SOMETIMES.  She is dressed quite scantily, and that's always appreciated.  BOYS, one of her more different sounding tunes, allows Spears to put her ... to good use, as she writhes around on stage and interacts, quite intimately, with her dancers.  STRONGER and NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN come after this.  I LOVE ROCK 'N' ROLL is one of the more energetic performances as she pips away on a raised platform, before she hangs from the ceiling mid-air, in a stunt you could see the Backstreet Boys or NSync pulling off.  Her urban influenced track WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME has plenty of synchronized dancing and energy.  LONELY would have to be one of the better performances as she interacts with a computer generated version of herself, seen on a big screen.  The song is almost like a duet.  Very cool.  Ballad DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW gives Britney time to breathe in a rather uninspired performance which is very lifeless and in this she sounds like a drag queen.  Sorry Ms Spears, this was the shows' downfall.  She picks up the pace with the cheery pop tune ANTICIPATING.  Plenty of colour, this peformance is vibrant and very much for the young.  She incorporates the audience into this one, by asking them to sing along and clap their hands to the chorus.  This all changes when she strips off to a tiny, shimmery skirt and green bra top, basically what she wore at the 2001 MTV's, minus the snake, for the pumped up performance of I'M A SLAVE 4 U.  This is an awesome performance with plenty of heat and no doubt her male fans will have a field day, thanks to Spears' bust and her attire.  You'll see what I mean.  After thanking everyone for coming out, she appears back on for an alternative take on her biggest hit to date, BABY ONE MORE TIME.  This is where she is drenched in a shower of rain for the performance which is not the ...BABY, we remember hearing.  But seeing a wet Spears is satisfactory enough.  <br />I strongly recommend this to any Britney fan.  You'll have fun.
B00000JR29|5.0|For many TFF fans, The Big Chair album will be forever remembered for it's giant hits 'Shout' and Everybody Wants To Rule The World' as well as the lesser number 3 hit 'Head Over Heels'.<br />For me while Shout and Everybody Wants To Rule The World are some of the best songs the 80s had to offer, this album has far more to offer than just those two songs alone. I enjoy the parent album versions of Shout and EWTRTW more than the shortened versions that have often appeared on many 80s compilations. I hate when they shorten the great Shout to only 4 minutes. It decreases it's listenability. On the other hand I love the 6 and a half minute version far more.<br />While Shout and EWTRTW are absolute classics, I often find myself listening to a lot of the other songs on this album more than those two major hits. For example, The Working Hour is in my opinion an incredible song with a strong disturbing melody filled with passion that burns like fire and radiates more emotion and talent with the first few notes of the synthesizers alone than anything that most of todays throwaway artist exhibit on their entire albums. The Working Hour is one of the best songs TFF have ever composed and is one of the major highlights.<br />The song Head Over Heels is a rich and powerful song. The version on the Tears Roll Down and Shout: Very Best Of TFF CDs ends with just the voice echoing away. On The Big Chair LP, the ending merges with a live performance of Broken that greatly increases it;s listening capibility. It ends with the sound of a crowd cheering ushering in Listen. Listen is a very ominous song with almost apocolyptic lyrics and a dark, brooding atmosphere and thundering beats that sends chills through me during every listen.<br />The version of The Big Chair I,m reviewing is the remastered version. The original version realeased in February of 1985 had only eight tracks. The remastered edition features seven bonus tracks for an even greater spectrum of TFFs incredible talent. The first three bonus The Big Chair, The Maurauders, and Empire Building, tracks are also available on the B-Sides Rarities collection Saturnine Martial Lunatic. These are moslty quirky instrumentals that casual fans might not enjoy too much but for me, I love every second of them. The Conflict is a song that was previously unreleased. It's a cool song with almost Phil Collins-like beats and bizarre electronic blips. The other three bonus tracks are remixes. Broken Revistited is longer than the original version although less powerful and not as heavy but still great.<br />The remix of Mothers Talk was the hit version, not the heavier parent album version. I love both versions. The remix version is more jazzy and not quite as aggressive. The U.S. remix of Shout is an eight minute mix that is great. Although it does not do the original version justice at least this is like a good reworking of the song.<br />I,m so glad I got the remastered version of this CD. In fact I have all three of TFFs first three albums remastered.<br />For all fans of 80s music get this incredible CD. I would recommend the Remastered edition more because it's almost twice as long as the 1985 version and with 15 tracks instead of just 8.<br />This is definately one of the best albums of the 20th Century. Don't stop there get the Seeds Of Love next. You'll be surprised at the difference between these two masterpieces. Get The Hurting as well but get the Big Chair and Seeds Of Love. Grrrrrr... Just get every TFF CD. They are all worth owning.t.

6304493681|3.0|After hearing so much praise for this film being one of the best animes ever, I can say I was somewhat disappointed. While the animation and monologues are nice and well-shot, the story seemed to lack a physical coherence. You have no feelings for the characters, or get to know them. Even though this was probably intended to some extent, as the movie centres around a computer-pervaded society, I found that it lost my interest and motive for watching. The film is short and jumps from place to place all too often with confusing and often pointless little sub-plots. The ending was disappointing and non-conclusive and left you with little idea of what you were just watching. This film is simply average. There are many better animes out there. I really don't understand why this is considered to be so monumental. Everybody is saying how \\"intelligent\\" and \\"meaningful\\" the plot is, but it's been used so many times, it's lost any previous impact. There are so many die-hard fans of this film, it's really kind of scary...
B00005YW4H|5.0|i am DEFINITELY feeling norah jones.  i love her voice, i truly appreciate her music, and i love her voice with her music.  hers is a jazz, country, lullaby hybrid sound that is really original and really very beautiful.  this is a great cd to cool out to, both on account of her smooth soothing voice and gently prodding music.  most definitely, this one is a keeper.
0553565915|5.0|This book really brought forth many feelings that I've developed over the years and confirmed them undeniably.  It made me cry because its words rang so true.  It gave more meaning to life and gave me hope.  Perhaps it could be a turn off for those who are not religious.  As Betty says, we are where we need to be religiously in this life, and those who do not benefit from this book are those that do not need the book to learn and grow on their current paths.  Check it out if you feel curious or drawn.
0006531407|5.0|I have to admit that this is the only survival book i own so i can't really compare it, but it's a great book, all the information is comprehensive with the possible exception of the fire lighting. The traps can get complicated but stick with the basics and you could survive for months, i went on a week survival regime with this book and a survival pack like he says and i survived easily.
B00005JKED|5.0|I loved this movie its filled with good performances,directing and style. The performances are simple amazing the film has a sold easy to follow story which makes it a easy watch(the violence and language is a differnt story)but people can easly be offended by the film because of its language and brutality but its true to life and is one of the best films of 2001.
B000002B7U|1.0|Almost 15 years after its release, I still struggle to get past the horrible sound of this record coming out of my stereo... No! I am not an evangelist! I am, however, a BIGGGGG Ozzy fan, and therefore, a disappointed fan as far as this record is concerned... where to begin? How about the lack of songs, and I mean REALLY GOOD songs... just listen to previous \\"Bark at the Moon\\" (just about any song off that record) and then listen \\"Thank god for the bomb\\"... c'mon!!! \\"killer of giants\\" sounds like a sad reworking of \\"Revelation(Mother Earth)\\", \\"Fool like you\\" ruins the whole thing at the end, \\"Never\\" never gets anywhere... The only song I really like is \\"Shot in the dark\\", while \\"the ultimate sin\\" and \\"secret loser\\" are barely decent... This is a typical example of what a friend of mine accurately calls \\"Filthy Glam\\". You think I am full of...? Stop for a moment and ask yourself: how many songs off this record are still in the live set of the old man? I rest my case.
B00003CXXR|5.0|Just 5 stars???? Go WAY AND WAY BEYOND!!!!!!! This was one of the best, absolutely best films I've ever seen in my whole entire life!!! Every single part of this movie is fantastic. I had loved dinosaurs since I was a very little kid. I'm not planning to be a paleontologist or something but I think dinosaurs are fascinating since they're animals. And I love all animals!!! I respect them a lot, and had studied about them for more than 8 years (I'm 14 right now). This movie is like a true science, especially biology and paleontology. And I love to study those stuff.<br />When I began to get glimpses of this movie, I was gasped, thinking how could Joe Johnston could make such a film that could entertain so many people? The dinosaurs are so realistic, that I'm imagining if they're still existing somewhere around this planet. And I'm sure that Sam Neill was glad to be in this film. He looked like a true paleontologist. This movie isn't just amazing, but it's also hilarious in some parts. Such as when this pilot name Nash sprays some paints on a old plane to resemble a shark, and then Cooper blows it up. I cracked up so much on that!! The music is great. John Williams is a true maestro. <br />What about dinosaurs?? They looked like truly real animals. It seems like there are more variety of dinosaurs than other two films. The Spinosaurus was great, terrific, I'd say. It's very good that the director put a larger carnivore than t-rex, because although rex is a symbol for jurassic park, it also tells that carnivores larger than rex did existed. Both rex and Spinosaurus were amazing. The battle between those two carnivores were great. Boy, Stan Winston sounded like if he's a dinosaur cloner, since he made them look like so realistic. Raptors were fantastic. The way they acted, the way they talked, the way they kill, etc. It seems like their coloration is changed little more than in two previous movies, which was pretty cool. It also looked like they were recieving feathers.Compys were little too short, but ok. The part where all these Corytosaurus and paras run in herds was magnificent, as they thundered the earth. For rest of herbivores, Brachiosaurs were astonishing. I knew that they were huge, more than 20 m. long, but I never thought they could be that huge!!! For ankylosaurs, it was pretty cool, watching them crunching on leaves. Man, I don't think adult ankylosaurs have any enemies. Their entire body is armored, including spikes on eyelids!!!!! Stegosaurus and other herbivores were little disappointing. They were too little shown. And that ceratosaurus, it was so funny!! The dinosaur ran away just because that the excrements stunk, instead of attacking people.<br />The pterosaur was incredible. Although they aren't dinos, they still lived with dinosaurs. Pteranodons were third largest of pterosaurs, and that's the one shown in this movie. Quetzalcoatlus is the largest, then ornithocheirus. Watching them snatching people out of ground just amazed me. They were lot more vicious than I thought!! <br />Everyone in the cast seems like did an excellent job, especially Sam Neill. That boy Trevor Morgan was so funny when he answers \\"you don't want to know\\" to Grant's question, and Grant had asked him how had he got t-rex's urine. <br />Few parts were disappointing and could be little better. They could show more of the herbivorous dinosaurs, more compys, and the most strange thing is that I didn't saw triceratops!!!...It seemed like the producers spent too much time on vicious carnivores, rather than herbivores. But that's that, and it doesn't really matter.<br />This movie is truly exciting, edge-of-the-seat plot...It's a one heck of a amazing film...
B000002H97|5.0|i am so sick and tired of seeing the word \\"sell out\\" associated with this album and this band. This album is simply awesome! Rob Rock produced (never a bad thing!!!) the band gives us here a taste of just what they can do. I have been a fan since the beginning and i say that this album is the first that they PROVE they are more than just 4 gus strumming power chords and banging a drum. they show 100% improvement and finally played with RHYTHM. as far as the slower tempo, it's called maturity. music matures as a person does. did anyone really expect them to sound the same forever? it still ROCKS HARD and is able to mellow down in a perfect blend. this is not my favorite album by them, but musically, it is the BEST!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic was released in the second golden era of hip hop [1994], it is considered by many experts to be one of the greatest albums of all time.  If you are someone who is a fan of glitzy rap music [Cash Money Millionaires, Master P, P.Diddy, etc.] stop reading now.<BR>     With that said this is in my opinion the greatest lyrical album of all time.  If it was only good for the lyrics I wouldn't give it 5 stars.  The production keeps you listening as well.  This album marks some of The Large Proffesor's best work as well as DJ Premier.  Pete Rock does a good job of holding it down as well on &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;.  Another good track is the Large Proffesor produced &quot;It Ain't Hard To Tell&quot; where he loops Michael Jackson's &quot;Human Nature&quot;.  The album is only 10 tracks long but you can listen to it all the way through.  I wouldn't reccomend this to fans of Nas's You Owe Me.  But if you are a fan of classic and groundbreaking hip hop, pick this one up.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a fabulous book. It's a good movie. It stays extremely faithful to the story (one might argue, too faithful) with very high production quality overall.<br />There are some cheesy scenes -- the Quidditch match dazzles some unsophisticated viewers, but I found the special effects in that scene to be quite poorly done.<br />The central story, that of a mistreated young boy who flourishes into a powerful wizard, is a universal theme that appeals especially to children. There is little objectionable material here, although some scenes are a bit scary. <br />Two complaints -- Daniel Radcliffe looks the part, but lacks the spark that shines through in the books -- and there is a general lack of imagination on the part of the director, Christopher Columbus. Compared to the Lord of the Rings, which required a visionary director in Peter Jackson and included far more complicated themes, Columbus simply goes for the most sure-fire formulas for the box office. To use an analogy, this is the Twinkie and Lord of the Rings is the gourmet, many-layered raspberry souffle.
B000060P79|5.0|wow! these guys are great... i really like this cd... one of my better buys recently... on my trip to florida it was the only cd i listened to the whole time. i definetly recommend No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls
B00005JKYS|5.0|We Were Soldiers is the war film I enjoyed the most since Saving Private Ryan (Well, ok, I haven't seen Black Hawk Down yet... my Uncle told me it's good... I'll check it out later).  Unlike the horrible, stupid Ben Affleck Pearl Harbor [movie], We Were Soldiers is watchable, moving, and mostly very accurate about the war (maybe 80% true & 20% fiction).  I almost cried during the film...<br />The typical Hollywood \\"We American nice, you enemy bad\\" black and white boring nonsense is toned down in this movie. (Some movie direcotrs just don't understand that the main characters are only great if the enemy is a worthy opponent)  Of course we still identify with Lt. Col. Moore & American side, but the film sort of give you an idea of what it's like for the other side.<br />Mel Gibson is a good actor as always, this one reminds me of his Braveheart performance (In case you have been living under a rock, Braveheart is also a good flick, if not historically accurate).  The story of We Were Soldiers starts out a bit slow, but in the process you get to understand the character more, not a bad trade off.<br />The war scene is a bit confusing, but that's how the war is supposed to be anyways.  I think the director does the good job conveying what's happening thru Lt. Col. Moore & enemy General's commands & tactics.  You could kind of understand what's going on  even if you are not a military fan (Heck, if my \\"I-like-Britney-Spear\\" friend could grasp most part, you should be able to, too.  And NO, I didn't have anyone else to go with at the time).<br />In sum, I highly recommand it.  I will definitely consider  buying the DVD when it comes out, if the price is right (Hey I know I am a cheapskate, but some DVD are just tempting... we'll see =p ).
B000002IWQ|5.0|I have been an avid Rush fan for about seven years and at one time owned all of their albums. Couterparts easily ranks in the top five of all the great Rush album's-its an album that rocks but in the politically aware, intellectual anthemic style of Rush, its not an attempt to capitalize on the current(for 1993) trends in rock-rather it is another step in the constant evolution of Rush. The return to their hard rock roots continued on &quot;Test for Echo&quot; and seems to continue on the preliminary releases from their new album &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;.
0800141326|4.0|I wish all the &quot;experts&quot; would stop trying to be Roger Ebert and just enjoy the movie!  This version of the giant reptile has terrific special effects and a softer feel to it.  Godzilla also has something I really go for in any movie.....a sense of humor!  The characters all contribute in this area and especially Jean Reno, who I think is a fine actor.<BR>So lighten up and enjoy.  This is no academy award winner, but really people, it wasn't meant to be!
B000060P79|5.0|This is an awesome cd that everyone must get.  The songs are extremely inspiring and anyone can easily relate to them.  The cooperation of Joel from Good Charlotte and Mark Hoppus from Blink-182 really add spice to the cd.  It's important to mention that it's also an enhanced cd.  You can view a video of clips of the band and the I'm Just A Kid video.  They really put a lot of work into it and you can hear it.  They obviously love what they do, because of the great quality of the songs and because they literally opened their heart and soul to the world.  They are not afraid to share how they feel, they're real, and inspiring.  Get the cd, it's a must have!!!  You'll love it for sure.
0792833260|5.0|A Must see! Impecable performance by Dusitn Hoffman. Tom Cruise shows his greatness again.
B00004XPP0|5.0|It simply doesn't get any better than Star Wars.
B00004Z511|5.0|Sophisticated beauty. That's what it is. Simple, minimalistic melodies, let alone the lyrics, and yet, beautiful. Very high concentration of pure beauty in your room. And you know what's great about it? Beauty is cathartic. Lisen to it, and see how your soul will be recovering from all the pain of the outer world.
B00005RG6B|4.0|This &quot;Operation livecrime&quot; was one of my first DVD's contact and is, no doubt, a BIG surprise, far beyond of what i was expecting! After more than 30 &quot;listenings&quot; of this same CD, putting the ears in DVD realise looks like you're listening the first one - you just have to close your eyes and enjoy... The band follows with pure fidelity all the tracks, playing them as the real h/Heavy lovers want their music: strong, cristal and adrenalized! We can see, for instance, a Geoff Tate on his best. No excess melodramatic nor reserved at all... Just in the right point, mixing quite well his voice between the two guitars, keeping, althoug, each one its personality and we can check it at every step. Chris de Garmo, Michael Wilton, as they show us before, complete themselves in sintony, ravishing the inside and the outside audience in an unforgettable way. They do rock indeed! Eddie and Scott, on bass and drums, respectively, close the other band sounds with the same quality. After seeing this DVD, whatever other bands's works i might get, this one, &quot;Operation livecrime&quot; will be my reference for other rock lovers's advices or even for me when i'm getting downn. <BR>Strongly recommended!<BR>Lopes
0790729369|5.0|I resisted seeing this movie. I had a hard time seeing the success of \\"Bridges of Madison County\\", with Eastwood as a leading \\"romantic\\" man. After watching this film, also directed by Eastwood, I have changed my tune. I have concluded that Eastwood even with his tough guy image can pull off just about anything.<br />Excelent film! Bridges of Madison County is a movie that is told almost entirely in flashback form. Through letters and jornals left by a mother, to her childern. Upon the mother's death.<br />The Jornals tell of a brief romance between an Italian imagrant farm-wife, Francesca Johnson, and a photographer for a national magazine, Robert Kinkade. Played brilantly by Streep and Eastwood.<br />Bridges of Madison County, is a middle age romance; love story. Set agninst backdrops in Iowa.<br />A beautiful film.
B00005OWIU|5.0|You know I'm a big John Williams fan, I heared almost every John Williams soundtracks but this one is truly the best of all. Actually I think it's the best of every CDs! This album gives the meaning of movie scores. What I really like is that music is absolutely part of Harry Potter's world, I truly can see the story just listening to this music! John Williams Forever!
0671582364|5.0|This is a fascinating piece of work, on many levels and for many reasons.  King serves up vignettes of his own past, his difficult upbringing,  with inspirations for some of his most famous characters and story lines.  <br />He mentions much of his work in the context of his own circumstances of the time - the alcoholic writer in \\"The Shining\\" as a metaphor for himself, \\"Cujo\\" written in an alcoholic and drug-induced haze, \\"The Stand\\" stalled and collapsing under its own weight, recovered by blowing up half the cast.  Then the interdiction by his wife and friends that turned his life around.<br />Little did he know that perhaps the most traumatic episode of his life was about to descend upon him halfway through work on this book.  The story of his near-fatal accident and ensuing recovery forms the last portion of the book and is as harrowing a tale as any of his fiction.<br />This book IS a tutorial on writing, and much valuable information is parlayed, not only at the nuts-and-bolts craft level, but also in establishing realistic assessment of one's future as a writer.  By tracking the development of writers he's watched develop (in addition of course to his own experience), he gives a clear-eyed perspective of life in the literary trenches.<br />Highly entertaining and enlightening, this book is a must for prospective writing professionals and provides a remarkable insight into the mind of a uniquely gifted raconteur. It's a treat for all King fans regardless of any aspirations for picking up the pen.
0780624890|3.0|What can I say about this movie... I liked it, but it took a while to grow on me. I can see this movie as being very much, for the boys.<br />Bieng a fan of the old television show &quot;Forever Knight.&quot; I see &quot;Blade&quot; as being a look at the darker side vampirism. Maybe even a darker look at my old favorite show.<br />As for &quot;Blade,&quot; I rather enjoyed the Martial Arts action. The  movie also had me dumping popcorn on my lap! Blade would be a great movie to see on Hollween.<br />Beware of nightmares from young viewers.
0060392886|5.0|This is the most exciting book I ever read.  I normally read a 200 page book in a few weeks.  I read this 430 page book in 3 days.  Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down.  The Dirt will never wash off me again.
B00005UEAR|5.0|DT never ceases to amaze the ear-drums!  These guys are simply put, AWESOME!  And yes, that includes the best singer ever, James LaBrie!
B000059PQ5|4.0|I'd heard lots about this film over the years but was unable to see it until a few years ago. It has the usual flaws of a spaghetti western (poor dubbing, choppy editting and almost silly lyrics for the title song), which are to be expected,and after having seen so many, are even endearing, but its quirkiness more than makes up for it. (Any film with the main character constantly dragging a coffin behind him in the mud has a certain deviant appeal.) Excepting the Leone westerns (which are so far above the ordinary Italian western that they are literally in a class by themselves), this is one of the best.
B00005BJPO|5.0|I saw this movie 10 yrs ago and I still love it!! Wonderful anime.
0684803356|2.0|This novel bored me.  And I like Hemingway's work.  Pilar's tragic stories go on and on, as do pointless conversations in caves with desperate people swearing at each other and hitting each other in the mouth (which, alas, only encourages more conversation instead of silencing it).  The constant use of &quot;obscenity,&quot; &quot;muck,&quot; etc. instead of the real swear words is truly wearying, and the translation of Spanish terms into &quot;thee,&quot; &quot;thou,&quot; and &quot;less bad&quot; mean nothing at all to the casual English reader.<br />Nor is Robert Jordan (why does Hemingway keep using his full name throughout the novel?  That's irritating too) much help, being a typical Hemingway strong-and-silent-type who drinks too much, enjoys bullfights, and lives to sleep with pretty 19-year-olds.  &quot;The earth moved&quot; is the best he can do in the supposedly passionate and brief love scenes with Maria, who enjoys pouring him more wine while washing his feet.  His doubts about doing his duty are neither profound nor convincing.  Until well into the novel he's a too-typical freedom fighter who justifies duty over Eros in dreary inner conversations.  Like another reviewer put it, I wished a quarter into the novel that he'd spare me his musings, blow the damned bridge and go home.
B0000060NA|3.0|I really only bought this for the magnificent &quot;I Wish&quot;.  I still marvel at the syncopated way that track begins, and works into a phenomenal groove.  It's worth it for that alone.  But &quot;Sir Duke&quot; with its unbelievable Tower of Power sounding sax's and trumpet section is a brillaint song as well.  I bought the cover single that David Parton did of &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; back in 1976, and now I can appreciate the original.<br />One thing worth commenting on is the superb production of the album and recording which is second to none.  Although an analogue original recording it has transferred to digital remarkably well.  Some albums fare worse showing up the hiss and noise of their original recordings.  The instruments sounds incredibly &quot;tight&quot; and well produced.
B000002H6C|5.0|I bought this cd just a few months ago. I heard it was really<BR>good but the production was not to scream hurray for. I listened to it and nothing was wrong with it. Honestly. Only the sound<BR>could have been better but anything else was fine. This was their<BR>big breakthrough. The album was released between MASTER OF PUPPETS and THE BLACK ALBUM and got into #6 on billboard 200.<BR>This album is great. Although it isnt as good as Master it<BR>becomes my 2nd favourite or third. This contained also their<BR>first hit single ONE. A great song on the album. If you dont have this one buy it you wont regret it.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Without doubt this is Bowie's greatest and most classic album.  I didn't pick it up till 1975, when Bowie was already hitting us with \\"Fame\\" and \\"Young Americans\\".  But I've been hopelessly in love with it ever since.  I'm the \\"boy in the bright blue jeans\\", who \\"jumped up on the stage\\".  And I definitely cried when they \\"asked if I knew his name\\".  I guess \\"Lady Stardust\\" is my favourite track.  The sad jangling piano, and Bowie sounds almost in tears with angst as he portrays the fateful Ziggy and the Spiders causing the crowd to love and be in awe at the music of this \\"new\\" band.  Bowie just manages to do that on this album; tear your heart to pieces as you feel for this man trying to vent his emotion from inside.  A melody to die for, utterly singable with tears in your eyes.<br />\\"Five Years\\" took some getting used to, but you soon realize what a monumental crescendo of a song it is.  It sets the background for the world that Ziggy is born into, something reminiscent of the world of Diamond Dogs in a way; very 1984.  A world on the edge of social rebellion and chaos.  And Ziggy tells us in this song, in monologue form, building and building to the terrible conclusion that we have \\"Five years\\" left to live, all awesomely backed by a frenetic string section.<br />\\"Starman\\" was the great hit most people know, and remains a timeless classic similar in stature to his other great \\"Life on Mars\\".  These are the songs that Frank Sinatra wished Burt Bacharac had written for him, if only it would have fitted in with the rest if his act!  Starman gives us some hope that may be out there there is a greater being and knowledge that might help our sorry world.  Trouble is he thinks he'd blow our mind.<br />\\"It ain't easy\\" grew on me enormously, purely for the superbly slick guitar playout, Mick Ronson presumably, and the lovely run into that sad piano beginning of \\"Lady Stardust\\" (if you've gotthe Cd that is!  Records, please turn over!  And don't we all listen for the \\"hmmm\\" from Bowie at the end of the line \\"all the woman really wants, you can give her something too\\".<br />\\"Soul Love\\" is brilliant for the melody, the harmony and the way he sings \\"the priest that tastes the word, and told of love, and how my God on high is all love\\" with venom.  Bowie just strung all these fantastic song melodies together, and made it seem effortless.  The sign of true genius.<br />The absolute genius moment being the end of \\"Soul Love\\" and count one, two, BANG ... the intro to \\"Moonage Daydream\\", right on que, is enough to put goosepimples on goosepimples..  \\"I'm an alligator; I'm a Momma Poppa calling for you\\".  True space age lyrics from the days when he used his cut up bits of paper to string lyrics together.  All driven by Ronsons powerful axe guitar, Daydream is a brilliant ride into orbit to escape the devastation below.  The relentless beat through to the end of the track is vey powerful, and we are treated to the monumental guitar solo at the end where Ronson makes the guitar sing and sweep through space, full of harmonics and reverb.  It takes a moment to come down to Earth after \\"Daydream\\".<br />\\"Star\\" is a fabulous rocker, that seems to change gear three or four times, with Bowie cleverly fitting the lyrics to the changes.  The brilliant backing vocals going \\"you know that I ...\\" while Bowie comes in with \\"I could do with the money, (you know that I) I'm so wiped out with things as they are\\".  A true nod towards the greats of Rock `n' Roll, like Elvis himself.<br />\\"Hang on to yourself\\" is a good rocker as well, most loved for it's neat guitar riff, but it's just an hors d'hoerve before we get one of the greatest guitar beginnings of a song in history.  That of \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" itself.  It's hard to say why it's so brilliant, but the melody, and the power and the tightness of the guitar playing, right down to the tone of the guitar are superb.  Bowie recounts the end of the Spiders from Mars in typical angst torn voice.  I have to say thatBauhaus did a fab cover version of this in 1982 which got somewhere towards the original guitar and vocals.<br />\\"Suffragette City\\" I've never been as bigger fan of as most people.  It is good; it's brilliant, I'm not so keen on the overly drawn out play-out.  We still hold our breath for \\"wham bam thank you man\\" though.<br />Finally we have \\"Rock `n' Roll Suicide\\".  One of my favourites.  The laconic beginning, lulls you into a false sense of security.   But Bowie is the master of changing up a gear, which he does with towering saxophones in the background as Bowie sings \\"Chev brakes are snarling, as you stumble across the road\\".  What is it?  A shameless plea to someone, amid the stupidity and mistakes of a life gone wrong, a shout to someone that \\"you're not alone; I've had my share, I can help you with the pain\\".  There are few more emotional songs around.<br />Ziggy is one album I never grow tired of.  I love it always, I grew up with it, and it's part of me.  How many albums can we say that about.  Not many.<br />Remember - play it loud!
B000005AYM|5.0|I Don´t exactly own this album. I have just listened to it<BR>few times at my sisters place. It is good. If you wan´t to <BR>buy a real r&amp;b soul album. This is the album for you.<br />buy it you won´t regret it.
0553213105|5.0|For anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I really should read the classics,&quot; 'Pride and Prejudice' is a wonderful place to begin.  Why?  First, the work is very readable, even though it was written well over a hundred years ago.  Second, it's not too long and the chapters are very short.  (I hope I'm beginning to convince you...)  Third, maybe you'll see yourself in the book or someone you know.  Fourth, Austen takes a humorous, entertaining, and throught-provoking look at human nature, which has not changed and probably never will.<br />Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a bright, intelligent young lady who is delighted to see her older sister Jane meet and fall for an English gentleman.  At the same time that her sister meets someone, Elizabeth meets a brash, arrogant man named Darcy.  Darcy's manner quickly irritates and disgusts Elizabeth beyond belief.  There's no way this couple could ever get together, right?  :)<br />Austen does a masterful job of telling an intelligent story that works as social commentary, a study of human nature, class distinctions, and so much more.  So many subtle shades of human pride, prejudice, arrogance, condescension, and forgiveness are present in the book as they are in real life.
B000002L6P|2.0|Well I find that Madonnas Like A Virgin is probably the second<BR>most overrated Madonna album to date. Although I consider it<BR>her worst. This album was released in november of 1984 and<BR>became a smash selling over 15 milion copies worldwide so far.<BR>This album was her 2nd after the first one which I found better<BR>MADONNA. this album containes the hits LIKE A VIRGIN, MATERIAL GIRL,DRESS YOU UP, ANGEL, an many more but only those 4 and about 1 or two really got to me and these songs arent 100% good.<BR>Im sorry but this album is far her worst album shes ever done.<BR>In 1986 she released TRUE BLUE a much better album which became her most succesful album (of new material). But this one. I guess you just have to buy the singels. If you are becoming a Madonna fan this is a must have and if you are a fan this is yours if not you cant be a fan. But if you just want to buy something with MADONNA . Buy TRUE BLUE,LIKE A PRAYER, EROTICA or BEDTIME STORIES but not this one and not RAY OF LIGHT.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Just as I was losing faith in the music industry, along comes Norah Jones on the Blue Note label. Rare is it to find a Blue Note recording in the Pop bins at your local music store, but that is where you can find Norah ... However, it doesn't really matter what label the music critics put on her. Norah is pure heart and soul. She is as refreshing as an evening sea breeze on the Gulf coast following a scortching-hot day. This CD deserves more than five stars. Well done, Norah! See you at the Grammys next year!
B000059MEK|4.0|That one word pretty much sums it up! After hearing &quot;One More Time&quot; I was hooked.  That has to be the most addicting song ever! Everytime I hear it, I can't get it out of my head, and I can't stop listening to it! A few months ago, I got the single.  I've practically worn it out, I've listened to it so much!  Within the last few days, I've easily heard it over 100 times.  Ok, now to the album, &quot;Discovery&quot;  I LOVE it!  After someone let me borrow it, I just had to have it!  It's been on repeat ever since.  One of these days, I'll get &quot;Homework&quot;
B00005JKED|3.0|Sure, it's gritty.  Sure, Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are excellent (each actor usually is!), but this movie hits reality as seldom as a barney episode.  As far as action cop movies go this one is absorbing for awhile until the screenplay takes us down some sort of exaggerated fantasy-violent wonderland.  the campaign to get Denzel,who is very good in this, the academy award must have been incredible.  Crowe's performance in \\"A Beautiful mind\\" shows an actor with the range to become the actor of his generation.  Once again Hollywood missed it.  This best actor Oscar will rank up there with John Wayne's for being ancient, Peter Finche's for being deceased, and Paul Newman's because they should had given him five by the time they gave him one!  I'm a Denzel fan!  His performances are always top notch. In this one you'll find his on the brand of evil policework  quite compelling, but it doesn't really compare to Russell Crowe's.  Academy members, shame on you!  It shouldn't be this easy to manipulate your voting.  5 years from now how memorable will Denzel's performance in this one be compared to Russell Crowe's?  Remember when you all voted for Oliver over 2001?  Here we go again.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This movie has got to be one of the under rated movies of all time. With great stars like Pacino and deNiro, how could this movie miss being nominated or even won an award for best action segment?<br />The parallelism between the two characters, Pacino, as a cop, and deNiro, as a leader of a robbery gang, was well written and executed by both actors. And the action? Well, if you havent seen a good firefight, wait till you see the bank heist scene. The sound effects were soooo realistic as they shoot it out on a major L.A. street. I own a laser disc copy and I'm quite happy about it. I bet the DVD copy's a lot better though. Michael Mann, you the man!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I don't normally throw around huge adjectives like &quot;fabulous&quot; or &quot;spectacular,&quot; but those are the only terms I can find to truly describe Shakira's first English-language CD.  Her voice and her lyrics are refreshingly unique, and she explores such a variety of styles (disco in &quot;Ready for the Good Times,&quot; the tango in &quot;Objection,&quot; and all-out rock in &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;) that no listener will be disappointed.<BR>     One thing is for sure:  Shakira has come to America, and she's here to stay.  And I only have one thing to say about her arrival:  Thank God!
014028009X|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read in a long time. Read the book before you see the movie. In some ways,we can all relate to Bridget and her hilarous misadventures. Everyone should read this book.
B000060P79|5.0|This is a great cd which combines poignant lyrics with catchy melodies.  It's a good listen and a great pick-me-up.  All in all it's just a fun disc all around.
B000002I2I|3.0|This is a good cd. Really it is. All the songs are pretty nicely done, none are intolerable to listen to. But none of it has that dark, energetic feel that once filled the doors albums before. People put down &quot;Waiting for the sun&quot; the cd, but in reality, that cd was great. It had the soft stuff, and the heavy stuff like &quot;not to touch the earth&quot;. Basically, something was lost around 1969 in Jim Morrison. The soft parade is the perfect example. A complete sellout. The worst of all of the cds. It kind of went like a V. At the beginning, the doors cds were great, then they started sinking a little, until they hit the bottom with &quot;soft parade&quot;, and from there it started to slowly move up again. This is on its way up from the worst, as &quot;LA woman&quot; is better than this one, with songs like &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; and &quot;LA Woman&quot;.<BR>    Morrison hotel is not nearly as bad as &quot;the soft parade&quot; inwhich only has one good song on it, known as the &quot;soft parade&quot;. Morrison Hotel has a lot of easy listening, good songs. Indian Summer, and The spy are both instant classics. But without the true Jim Morrison substance like &quot;the end&quot;, &quot;My wild love&quot;, &quot;Break on through&quot;, &quot;People are strange&quot;, or even &quot;riders on the storm&quot; which came later, the cd remains empty of magic. I would almost would reccommend &quot;Soft parade&quot;, the worst of them all over this, just because of its one explosive song, &quot;the soft parade&quot; and it is more powerful than any of the songs on this cd.<BR>   If you don't mind the fact that there isn't that fire that was behind the first three cds, or was somewhat there on the last cd, then this is a good buy. But buy the self titled, &quot;strange days&quot;, &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; and &quot;LA woman&quot; first, because they are all better, whether technically or not. Don't even bother with &quot;Soft Parade&quot; unless you want to get your heart broken.
B00000DLUV|5.0|I had the opportunity to see this concert in person in Las Vegas, NV but work constraints kept me from it; and, am I ever sorry.  I also have the video to this live concert &amp; the chemistry between the brothers is as electrifying on CD as it is to see.  An exceptional performance on Robin Gibb's part for &quot;I Started A Joke&quot;--the man is extraordinary...sounds almost as good as the original recording.  Maurice Gibb provides great musical accompaniment &amp; background vocals as well as doing one of his own...he's my fav!  What can one say about Barry Gibb's extraordinary range within the vocal spectrum...he never ceases to amaze me...&quot;Words&quot; has always been my favorite Bee Gees song...never done better than live on stage with his brothers backup.  If you get the CD, the video has to be on your priority list of things to get...puts everything into perspective...especially the tribute to their late brother, Andy.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|Session 9 is deliciously spooky. Brad Anderson revives some of the most cliche haunted house conventions with stylish direction, complex story layering, and enough plot twists to keep you curious and creeped out. The film is packed with great shots and beautifully framed images that will stick in your head days after you watch. Although the performances (especially David Caruso's) occasionally fall flat and the voice over technique is pretty silly, Session 9 is a must see for anyone who loves a good scary movie.
1559408898|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was originally released in 1987.  I did not see any previews for this picture before I went to the theater.  so, I remember entering the movie curious on what to expect.<br />On the big screen back in 1987, I was extremely impressed with the special effects, especially the \\"ED-209\\" robot. The sound vibrated the theater and I left that night loving the action of the movie.  I also remember liking the humor within the movie.   I watched it several times since then on video, but each time I did not have the same feeling of \\"Wow!\\" since my original viewing. The movie lost a lot on the T.V. screen. <br />I haven't watched the movie for a least 5 years, so I recently just rented the DVD version. The director added in few extra scenes, mostly adding more blood and gore. The acting is still overboard, the violence still excessive and the special effects still impressive...but I love it.  The writing is similar to a Army of Darkness film. <br />This is a sci-fi, action, comedy movie(if there is such a category!.) And it is still fun to watch after all these years.
B00005RIZP|5.0|I got this video a week ago and this is the best horror movie I have seen in a while.  The bizarre telefone calls are frightening.  There is great acting especially by Olivia Hussey as the heroine and a great performance by Margot Kidder. The movie is about a sorority house that is getting chilling phone calls from a crazy psycho. The killer goes bolistic and kills sorority sisters one by one. The prime suspect is Jesse's (Olivia Hussey)boyfriend Peter. Is Peter the killer? Little do the sorority sisters know that the killer is right above them in their attic. The movie might drag the plot a little but that will be made up for its great and creepy ending. This movie came out before Halloween by 4 years.  This is a movie that will make you stay up all night.  This maybe a hard movie to get, but when you finally get it, it was worth the wait.  Bob Clark did a great job setting the frightning mood in the story. Black Christmas is one of the best horror films in a while and they don't seem to make them like this anymore.
B00005OAIE|5.0|BUy the CD, listen to it two of three times, and realize why.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|&quot;A story of truth, freedom, beauty, and most importantly love,&quot; Moulin Rouge delivers the audience to the edge of their seats. A musical with class, romance, drama, action, suspense, and exceptional screen play, it is hard to put into words how great this movie is.  Let me just say that I love movies, musicals, and most of all, Kidman (who I believe is the best actress after watching The Others) and if you do too, I recommend whole heartedly that you go out and buy yourself a copy.  Nicole Kidman, and Ewan are surprisingly great singers and they sing &quot;live on camera&quot; to capture the realism that the movie/musical very well delivers.<br />&quot;Spectacular Spectacular, No words in the vernacular can describe this great event. You'll be dumb with wonderment.&quot;<BR>&quot;We would have created the world's first completely modern, entirely electric, totally Bohemian, all singing, all dancing, stage spectacular!&quot;                <BR>                                -Harold Ziddler (Moulin Rouge)
6305971935|4.0|Because this film lacked real star power, not many people have caught this as they should have.  Even non sci-fi fans will enjoy this one.  No need for me to reiterate the plot.  The story is tightly crafted, well acted, and beautifully executed.  Everything is explained nicely and nothing left to confuse the viewer.  What is truly refreshing is the use of actual older actors playing the characters at later ages.  No latex for a change!<br />Word of warning:  If you order this used, be sure the version you are getting is produced by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  It's wide-screen and contains the trailer as an additional feature.  There is another version out there which is advertised as containing no features.  This one is put out by an independent distributor, is Pan &amp; Scan, the picture quality is dark, very grainy, and sound poor.
B000062Y98|5.0|By far it's, the best cd BLIND GUARDIAN has done.The musicianship is incredible . The more you listen to NIGHT AT THE OPERA , the more you will love it . I can't seem to stop listening to it. If you love BLIND GUARDIAN then you should own this already , so get it . METAL RULES .
B00005RY7X|3.0|This is not a metal album by any stretch, but it is very catchy and a fun drinking album.  Mildly recommended.
B000002H33|5.0|First i would like to say i am only 14 years old, but metallica have been my favorite band since second grade. <br />As all of you may know, this cd was the last to feature the amazing bass playing of Cliff Burton. Cliff was more than just a bassist, he was truly an amazing songwriter. he, along with Randy Rhoades who played with Ozzy, were the first to bring classical-styled influence to metal music. with songs like &quot;orion&quot; this cd displays how beauitiful and still powerful metallica can be. And the standout track on this album for me, &quot;disposable heros&quot;, deals with war and loss. <br />Kirk Hammets guitars shine on ....And Justice For all, james vocals and lars drumming are amazing on the black album, but i still think this is the gem of Metallicas releases.<br />R.I.P Cliff
B00005T30L|4.0|...<BR>Enid was not a funny girl. She was cruel, self-centered, and lazy. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy watching her move in and around people's lives...I'm just saying I didn't think it was funny. I actually thought it was a little sad.<br />The only moment in the film where I was really charmed by Enid was the scene in the hospital with Seymore (I won't spoil it..) But I think the film should have ended there. <BR>I don't understand the Bus Stop ending.<br />Thora Birch is an amazing actress. I do hope to see her in more Indy Roles...I think they suit her very well.<BR>Ditto on Steve Buscemi.<BR>Bob Balaban was FANTASTIC as Enid's Dad.<br />I'd have given this 5 stars if it weren't for the lame ending. I did think this movie was super...just not as a Dark Comedy. I'd label it a Dark Drama.
6300183211|5.0|This in my opinion is not only the definitive gangster movie of the 20th century, but also by far Brian De Palma and Al Pacinos best work.<br />This is a movie about a cuban hit-man turned international cocaine-dealer. it is also a story about greed, and what can happen to a man if he is givin everything he ever wanted. <br />Scarface is a classic of american films, and everyone who enjoys gangster, or any type of movie, should see it.
B000002H1T|5.0|When I heard Mutt Lange was in on this project and they finally fired Roy Thomas Baker (an album or two too late in my opinion) I had high hopes.  Those hopes were met with a masterpiece.  Whats odd about this album, as awesome as it was at the time, it sounds more dated than alot of other Cars stuff.  It might be the simple melodies, or more likely the 'high tech' (at the time) sound of it.  The only possible filler here may be &quot;I Refuse&quot; or &quot;Why Cant I Have You&quot;, but even then they'd be hits on either of the two previous Cars albums.  Otherwise all the other songs are very likeable
B00000373U|4.0|Elliott Smith combines a sad-eyed look and sensibility with witty, original, piercing songwriting.  Every song on this album pulls you in, asks you to stay, and you are happy to do so. <br />&quot;Rose Parade&quot; simultaneously satirizes actual parades and the so-called parade of life while still maintaining a sweetness along with its edge.  Smith is a master at melding an &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude with a real yearning for being inside, warm, and close to someone.  That dual sensibility shines through here.<br />On &quot;No Name No. 5,&quot; Smith addresses the power of life to continue no matter what heartbreak any individual might be enduring:<br />&quot; . . . Everybody's gone at last<BR>And you don't get upset about it<BR>No, not anymore<BR>There's nothing wrong<BR>That wasn't wrong before . . . &quot;<br />There's no getting around the Simon &amp; Garfunkel ghosts hovering around the guitar work on this album, and that's fine--but Smith never sounds imitative or slavish.  On &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;2:45 AM&quot; especially, Smith seems very nearly to be channeling S&amp;G (remember &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3:00 AM&quot;?) and that's not a bad thing.  This is a very fine effort by a thoughtful and frighteningly talented singer/songwriter.
B00003CXBK|5.0|First I thought it would be just another Japanese Animation Movie. After watching these I was amazed by the quality of the animation and the story. Worth buying. Trust me youwon't regret watching this movie.
B000060P79|5.0|If you are looking for a CD that you can listen the whole way through, then buy Simple plan! I could listen to this all day! Seriously I'm not easy to impress either, but this CD totally rocks! The tracks are refreshing and easy to listen to, and I can totally relate to the lyrics especially \\"I'm just a kid\\" and \\"perfect\\". GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD!!!!   NOW!!!
B0000630BT|5.0|Overall, this is my personal favorite album.  If you're a fan of fast songs, you'll probably like this.  Below is a rating of each song.  1-10 scale<br />1. Painkiller 9.0<BR>2. Hell Patrol 8.5<BR>3. All Guns Blazing 8.5<BR>4. Leather Rebel 8.0<BR>5. Metal Meltdown 8.5<BR>6. Night Crawler 8.5<BR>7. Between the Hammer & the Anvil 8.5<BR>8. A Touch of Evil 7.0<BR>9. Battle Hymn and 10. One Shot at Glory 9.5<BR>11. Living Bad Dreams 7.5<BR>12. Leather Rebel (live) 8.0<br />The sound quality does seem improved.  The bonus track is average.  If it was me, I'd put something faster to keep with the mood.  The live version of Leather Rebel was about on par with the regular song as you could want.

B00003CXTG|1.0|I almost walked out of this one.  Outside of the battle scenes, every element of this movie is so bad that I feel it is disrespectful to the men who died at Pearl Harbor and all who fought in World War II.
078401213X|4.0|Well, it's dead classy, that's for sure. Shot in hi-contrast, grainy monotone, Pi has a beautifully edgy feel of film noir about it, and the performances of the small cast are outstanding.<br />The black and white film, the quick, jerky shots and quirky camera angles boost the paranoid effect, and just like the mathematical patterns in nature, the narrative recurs methodically (there's an interesting contrast between Max, who believes everything in nature - including the stock market - can be reduced to a pattern and therefore predicted, and his former mentor who cries \\"there's more to life than numbers!\\").<br />We see the world from the perspective of obsessive number theorist Max Cohen, whose routine-based life gives the film its rhythm. By a series of repeated actions - Max stating his assumptions, peering through his peephole, unlocking the five locks on his door, visiting a diner, riding the subway, popping his medication, tooling around on his computer, waking up with a bloody nose - we get a handle on the world inside the movie. But even this view is flawed: Max's grip on lucidity is punctuated by ever-more frequent and violent psychotic episodes, which are - well, seem to be - followed by hallucinations. Sometimes the only way of telling what's real and what isn't - is to judge by where you are in Max's daily cycle (i.e. \\"Is it just after a psychotic reaction? Then this must be a hallucination\\" etc.).<br />Which kind of means you have to be concentrating the whole time to keep up with what's going on. Pi therefore isn't an easy movie to watch - it won't just wash over you.<br />On the other hand, this very quality compromises any chance Pi might have to make a whole lot of sense. The supporting characters aren't well integrated - they can't be; the style of filming won't allow it, and it's even worse at aiding narrative - net result, you're left none the wiser about a lot of fairly central things: who are these bad characters from Wall Street, and why are they chasing Max? What about the Hassidic \\"good guys\\" (are they good guys?) and their theory that Max has unwittingly discovered God's true name in a number sequence? What point does the film make about it? What's the significance of the brain Max keeps hallucinating about? Why does he shave off his hair and start obsessing about something inside his head?<br />Most importantly, why is the movie called Pi at all, when it's actually about spiral theory and the golden section?<br />Questions, questions, questions. Maybe I'm over-analysing and the point is you're *meant* to let the film wash over you without making any sense. Pi is well enough executed and its sheer notion of rhythm and pattern (in the film as well as in nature) is interesting enough by itself to sustain the picture, so it gets a solid vote from me.e they chasing Max?

B00005A1VG|5.0|Rousingly performed, expertly paced, and beautifully photographed, this initial entry in the process of technicolor is a triumph of Hollywood movie-making. Errol Flynn gets the role he was born to play, likewise his foil, the hawk-nosed Basil Rathbone whose eloquent voice and sinister manner penetrate as deeply and lastingly as any rapier thrust and parry. In fact, a whole host of middling studio players find their perfect visual counterparts in this glorious production which apparently was tossed off without recognition of the classic it is. Nor has technicolor ever produced richer splashes of color than in the outdoor gallery scenes and forest celebrations that tellingly oppose the coldly cavernous interiors of the pretender king. (Note also the occasional off-angle camera setups that tend to slip by, but add wonderfully to the action flow.) Like John Wayne, Flynn had a narrow thespic range, but once there, he could be commanding, such that here as the lord of Sherwood, he forever foredooms all attempts at a remake. Viewed sixty years later, the film reminds me of a low-tech, pastoral version of Star Wars -- the appeal is the same, though the Keighley/Curtiz film wins the Jenny Craig no-flab award hands-down. Probably, no film before or since has so expertly mixed action with romance, humor, and solid human values as this one. Nor has any screen experience functioned more effectively in the quest for justice and fulfillment than this apparently light-hearted Warner Bros. entertainment. For once everything cinematic fell into place in the dressed-up scrub lands of southern California, to produce an uplifting fairy tale, which by any measure, should qualify among the all-time best of any film genre. Above all, it remains a genuine and much beloved classic of the studio era. So whatever you do, don't miss it.
B000002KET|5.0|I can't believe I once had a lukewarm opinion of these masterpiece.  This drives all the way and contains one of the bands best songs, Killing Yourself To Live.  I can't help but have top notch workouts when i listen to this driving rock classic.  I don't care that I probably look like a nut as i play the air guitar between sets. highy recommended!!!
B00005JKNF|4.0|This movie is sort of like Masterpiece Theater with Alistair Cook on steroids, and I enjoyed it even though it's not really my \\"cup of tea.\\" (Sorry about that). But if you like Anthony Trollope novels or liked Masterpiece Theater, you'll probably like this movie. A friend of mine recently had two friends visiting from England. They saw the movie and raved about it, but again, it probably helps to be into this sort of high-society period piece.<br />But I will say that as a period piece it's pretty striking--I felt sorry for the prop guy because of all the old 1930's paraphernalia somebody had to scrounge up. Because of that, it did seem very realistic and faithful to the historical details. If you like old cars, you'll enjoy the mint-condition old Rolls Royces that come and go. I'll bet those are worth some serious money.<br />The look behind the scenes of a British upper-crust family and their friends and visitors is sort of interesting, because the movie gives equal weight to both the servant staff and the more noble-born characters. The characters of all the servants--the butlers, valets, housekeeping staff, and so on--are developed in just as much depth and detail as the aristocratic family members themselves. So at least in one important respect this movie is different from your usual British high society novel or story, and actually most of the servants turn out to be more interesting as characters than the high-society types.<br />To sum up, despite my predilection for faster-pasted and somewhat different movies, I still thought this was an excellent film and worth seeing if like this sort of story.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple plan is such a great emo/punk band,man you ask me they sound like NFG, i mean they make the same sorta music..But IT STILL ROCKS!! I mean especially the track \\"meet you there\\" that song in my opinion is the best song on that cd..i mean i love it!!Just like every other track on that cd. I mean this is probably one of the only punk bands i like that are outta canada..besides a few.NOT SUM 41!! But this albums great...
B0000634EV|5.0|this album kicks ...  i listened to the 1st album (NOLA) so many times that i wore out two copies in one year.  this is even better i haven't taken it out of my cd player yet.  if you are into hard hitting music with well thoughtout lyrics and music check this out. it carries elements from each of the members respective other bands. it also goes into territory all its own.  from the rage in \\"ghost of the mississippi\\" to the acoustic hugeness of \\"landing on the mountains of meggido\\" this album rocks.  i highly reccomend this album to anyone and everyone.

B00000AFGM|5.0|Mechanical Animals is Marilyn Mansons fourth studio effort, launched in the fall of 1998 through Interscope records.Instead of the industrial hsrd rock/metal that &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; savagely brought to most of his fans, &quot;Animals&quot; breaks free from the roots of the band and gives us dynamic and glamorous guitar riffs.The new godfather of Manson was clearly David Bowie in his &quot;Alladin Sane&quot; era in the  seventies.Trent Reznor vanished and greedy seedy Marilyn buried his so called &quot;we love hate&quot; feeling, replacing it by the androgyn being of &quot;Omega and the Mechanical Animals&quot;.Musically its the good priests most melodic and catchy album, which doesnt mean there arent a couple of amazing rock and roll songs in it, such as &quot;The dope show&quot;, &quot;Rock is dead, &quot;Coma white&quot; or even &quot;disassociative&quot;.Theres also a great deal of melancholy and subtle fury in it, a perfect combination of &quot;this lifes aint worth living&quot; with &quot;this ia a riot religious and clean&quot;.Mechanical Animals is another great record of Marilyn Manson and any band would surely be hard pressed to top.
B000002PB2|5.0|Their masterpiece debut album in 1982 may not have huge hits as Sister Christian but the album as a whole shows what great rock is all about. Don't Tell Me You Love Me is a nice blasting opener copmparable to that Rock In America in Midnight Madness their second another excellent CD. Sing Me Away, dramatic power ballad literally makes me want to sing along. Eddie's Coming Around Tonight shows Alan Fitzerald's excellent keyboard with nice Brad's guitar riff. Overall their rock style may be close to Loverboy but with twin guitar performance by Brad and Jeff gave them clear distinction with keyboard laden Foreigner, Journey and yet retaining well-refined form of rock comparable to Survivor or Toto.<br />Essential for 80's rock lovers.
B00005OWEG|4.0|...APOCALYPSE NOW was a long rambling film, that should have been  edited to a much shorter length. Coppola was simply too ambitious and let the film get away from him. Now, the REDUX attempts to improve the original by adding instead of subtracting. While REDUX does explain some things, such as why the Playboy Bunnies were in the movie, the movie would have been much better, certainly easier to digest, if it had been less ambitious in it's scope and more concise in it's message.<br />It's still a great movie though. Most males who see it for the first time, become obessed with it and watch it over and over until they walk around quoting lines from it, and you begin to worry about their sanity. (Some Vietnam War vets tend to see it as campy though, despite the horror it contains.) But it's worth the price just having a DVD for no other reason than to watch the helicopter attack scene, which is one of the best action sequences ever.
B000000W5N|2.0|OK, Sticky Fingers has some excellent songs on it (Wild Horses, Sister Morphine etc), but then there is the WORST SONG EVER. have YOU read the lyrics to Brown Sugar? Hey, lets combine some of the worst ideas ever... ... into one song! Supposedly its also about cocaine (cant see the references) but that stuff is bad for you. Dont glorify it. Stick to the psychadelics, folks. Its just like pretty much every Stones album, and every Guns N Roses album. You have some amazing songs (YCAGWYW, Paint it Black, Beast of Burden) and some absolutely horrible songs, like Brown Sugar and Midnight Rambler (and of course some downright stupid songs like \\"country honk\\" and \\"miss you\\") ...  I for one have a burned compilation CD of the best off of Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, and Sticky Fingers (to augment High Tides Green Grass and Through the Past Darkly)
B000056K04|3.0|Although perfectly satisfying and an all-around solid album, Everyday fails to show the musical artistry Dave demonstrated in previous releases such as Crash and BTCS. The new electric guitar ends up sounding monotone and doesn't allow for the band to showcase their real talent. In fact, the material is entirely different than the original songs on Remember Two Things and Recently, and isn't as unique as BTCS or Live at Luther College. It sounds more like U2 and Semisonic. While this is a good album, it is too much like pop music, so I would recommend it for casual listeners but not hard-core Dave fans. Highlights are &quot;The Space Between,&quot; &quot;Everyday,&quot; and &quot;If I Had It All.&quot;
B00005MG2Y|5.0|I have to say i only got into linkin park in septemeber 2001. The record in the end is fantastic, and what i really love about this album is that they have been able to write lyrics with out using foul language. I happily allow my children to listen to this.
6305307261|5.0|This DVD has a nice picture and is a two-sided DVD: side one is the German Language edition which is also presented with 5.1 Dolby sound and a commentary with Werner Herzog and an interviewer. Side two consists of the English langauge edition (which was actually filmed separately in parts), and has a nicer picture quality of the two sides.<br />I don't see the emphasis on the \\"pure\\" German soundtrack as Isabelle Adjani and the little comic who plays Renfield are both French actors and their voices are overdubbed. Herzog himself also confesses that much of the film was filmed by English speech as it is a more \\"international language\\" than is German. Besides, the film just seems to \\"work\\" better in English in my opinion (as does Aguierre for other reasons). <br />The image quality is good, but not ultimately great - it's a bit grainy in places. The screen is presented in a shallow 1.85:1 widescreen format and includes a behind the scenes featurette and several trailers. The sound quality is fine, no complaints.<br />Warning - I tried ordering this DVD from [another website], and the order was never fulfilled (they had no copy in any of their warehouses), (...so let that be a plug for Amazon)!!! :-)
B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolat is a nice movie about a woman who sweeps into a tiny French town and opens a chocolate shop during Lent. Viviane(Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter soon have most of the people trying her chocolates and revealing their secrets. The people to watch here are Judi Dench and Lena Olin<BR>Alfred Molina plays the well intentioned but uptight head of the community who gets into a battle of wills with Viviane.<BR>Johnny Depp adds to the chaos by coming into town with his band of 'River Rats' and being Viviane's love interest<BR>The movie is beautifully photographed and the music is great. This is a great movie to watch at home with your boyfriend when you're in the mood for romance.
0385484518|5.0|...I loved it! It brings death down to a very human level. It makes a person realize how selfish the healthy are, especially when there are people like Morrie in this world. He is dying yet he teaches the the rest of us how to live. I would recommend this book to anyone who is afraid of dying. I think you will view it differently after reading this.

B000002LBH|5.0|Although some Smiths fans prefer \\"Hatful of Hallow\\" <BR>over \\"Louder Than Bombs\\", citing the rawness over \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" polished singles and b-sides, \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" is essential to any Smiths collection.  <br />   The Smiths not only made good albums,they were masters of the 3 minute pop single.  Morrissey and Marr were influence by alot of 60's bands who often worked at a breakneck speed and sought to emulate them in the studio, which accounts for the quality and amount of work they did in such a sort period of time.  They did some of their best work on their singles releases which often contained songs such as \\"Panic\\", \\"You Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\\", \\"Ask\\", etc, that never appeared on albums.  \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" is a much more thorough account of the Smiths singles and b-sides than \\"Hatull of Hallow\\" which only accounts for about half of the Smiths singles releases, altough a fine record in its own right.  But \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" truly cements the Smiths place of being one of best English bands of the 80's.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is awesome! he sings, plays guitar and writes his own songs- what more could you want? one reviewer said that they thought his lyrics were immature and simplistic, but thats part of whats good, he just puts it out there, theres nothing cryptic about his songs. One of the best CDs in my collection. everybody should definately have it
B0000634EV|5.0|This is another strong peice of work from one of the few surviving real metal bands left.  Although I prefer the original release, Nola, Down 2 serves up some massive riffs, searing leads and vocals rich with baritone and expression. Down 2 offers plenty of killer metal songs to satisfy any beer drinking metalhead, but it is the rest of the album which not only comes as a surprise, but is the albums strength.  Songs such as &quot;learn from this mistakes&quot; and where I'm going(on which pepper plays a 1932 steel guitar) are extremely well done and set the mood of the album. This album will not go well next to any Korn or Limp Bizkit CD, but if you are into older style, Sabbath influenced Metal, or just like very well writen and preformed songs, this album is for you.
0679720200|1.0|I have read a previous translation of The Stranger, and was deeply moved. My entire life was changed. The previous translator did Camus justice. Matthew Ward, with this translation of The Stranger, ruined the novel. Ward includes awful cliche and unintelligent description. Unfortunately this is the only translation currently in print in the US. If you are able to, please order from a forgein printer (sometimes printed under the title The Outsider) or consider searching for an out of print copy not translated by Matthew Ward.
0061091480|5.0|This book showed me a way out of 14 years of self-destructive behavior.  The ideas expressed are SO simple and after reading just the first few chapters I knew that I had finally stumbled onto a gold mine of &quot;how to live the happiest life possible.&quot;  I would like to comment about the review from Feb 2002, Dr. Dyer does not &quot;over-stress the idea of complete personal autonomy&quot; in regard to marital relationships.  What Dr. Dyer stresses is that if a person gives up something unwillingly; because of guilt, worry, or out of the need for approval, etc., then THAT is the point where it becomes an erroneous zone (self-defeating behavior) giving freely and lovingly to a spouse/significant other must come from personal choice.  <BR>This is an outstanding book!  I have my mom's original copy from 1976 and never read it until now.  Some of the references are a little dated (songs quoted, cultural-norm examples) but the message transcends time.  I HIGHLY recommend this book, especially if you feel you've lost control of your own happiness.
0060392886|4.0|430 Pages!! Don't get me wrong, I love the Crue but this book was just way too long. Especially some of the background knowledge of Nikki and Vince's childhoods...SKIP. The name of the book is DIRT and that's exactly what I wanted to read. All about the porn stars, wild tours, drug addictions, and run-ins with the law over the life of the band. The Dirt does deliver a lot of that stuff. Especially some keen insight into the LEE/LOCKLEAR and LEE/ANDERSON marriages. I grew up listening to the Crue and love most of their music but these guys are seriously messed up. Nikki Sixx is one of the most depraved human beings(if you can call him that!) I have ever read about. It is truly a miracle that he is still alive today. The book is a good read which delves deep into the differing perspectives of each band member. Mick comes off abrupt and guarded, Tommy comes off like the mimbo that he is, Nikki comes off like a psycho, and Vince, well Vince is just the @sshole. Anyway, Crue fans won't be disappointed with the level of debauchery in this book that far exceeds anything I could have imagined was going on in these guys lives. Limited Recommendation to hardcore fans only.

B0000634EV|5.0|This is a great metal album, it encompases a lot of what heavy metal is all about; heavy riffs, lots of Phil singing/yelling, and an overall feeling to bang your head.  Don't get me wrong though....if you only like the nu style of Metal, then this probably isnt for you.   This album is good quality heavy music, with an overall emphasis on the MUSIC itself, as opposed to the normal 3 chords played by a lot of the nu-metal bands.  Lots of intricate guitar work, and great drumming to.  I would reccomend this to anyone who liked the first Down album, as well as anyone who likes Pantera or other southern metal bands.  This is good quality metal, folks, and you can actually listen to the whole album and not just a song or two.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams is by far the greatest composer of the age. Numerous masterpieces have secured him this spot, and Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone only makes this more evident. Riveting songs with flowing movement and powerful lines leave listeners gasping for more. Hedwig's Theme is my personal favorite, a very beautiful song in it's own right. Overall, a must buy for any serious lover of music.
6304779356|4.0|This is a great vamp flick.  It is about a newly divorced mother and her sons who move into Santa Carla, a city overriden with vampires.  Michal, her oldest son, becomes one of these creatures by falling in love with Star, a demi-vampire.  He then tries to stop the others and fight what he had become.  While being a good movie plot-wise, I think that the protagonists were a bit on the corny side and am truly amazed that they won.  All in all, it's something to see if you're a vampire movie enthusiast.
B000002LRX|5.0|I will forever respect the band that was (I wish I could say \\"still is\\") Faith No More for having the onions to put out Angel Dust, which is quite possibly the most commercially suicidal album ever made.  They had a perfect opportunity to sell out at a time when they were still cutting edge.  But instead they made new songs that were darker and more cerebral than anything that was on The Real Thing.  It also seemed as if vocalist Mike Patton let the influence of his other band Mr. Bungle seep into FNM.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say the purpose of Angel Dust was weed out the newfound trendies that latched on when \\"Epic\\" became a big hit.<br />You know you're in for a wild trip when \\"Land of Sunshine\\" kicks in.  Patton assumes the character of a deranged self-help guru, someone who needs far more professional treatment than his clients.  \\"RV\\" is a country sounding number about a curmudgeon who does little more than talk to himself.  Who else but FNM would go from 1970s disco one second to a Nuremburg rally circa 1939 on top of heavy metal the next in the song \\"Crack Hitler\\"?  Perhaps they were making a statement by juxtaposing two of the twentienth century's greatest evils: Nazism and disco.  Don't let the innocent sounding cheerleader chorus of \\"Be Aggressive\\" fool you.  Even though the song has no actual profanity, the subject matter was enough to give the album its parental advisory sticker. \\"Jizzlobber\\" a bludgeoningly slow heavy number that ends with a huge cathredal organ.  And finally to top it all off is a faithful remake of \\"Midnight Cowboy\\"(?). And these are the EASY songs to figure out.<br />As I said before this is one of the great anti-sellout albums.  It also shows FNM, especially Patton, improving on all levels.  Patton loses the whine that was so prevalent in The Real Thing.  It is here on Angel Dust in which he becomes the most versatile rock vocalist since Freddie Mercury, which is definitely no easy task.  So if you have a sense of adventure when it comes to your musical tastes, Angel Dust should already be in your collection.when it comes to your musical tastes, Angel Dust should already be in your collection.

079073804X|1.0|I brought the special edition on video just because it might scare me and I thought half of the movie wasn't scary. There were just a bit few scenes that were scary and those scenes are the Spiderwalk scene and the scene were the girl's head is twisting. I thought this horror movie was dumb and it didn't even scare me. I thought it was kind of funny actually because in the movie Scary Movie 2 they make fun of this movie and that's why it didn't scare me. It does have good acting, best special effects. But the whole movie wasn't scary and it didn't give me nightmares. So if you plan on seeing this movie you won't get scared. I guess back in the old days in the late 70's everybody was scared when they saw this movie but it didn't scare me. If you want to see a good horror flick go see The Others.

Not like some albums where you like 3-4 the first time, and learn to like several more as you play it.  I cannot remember when I have heard such great music, and singing since I heard the Doors 1st album.  I hope Shakira produces much more music like this!  I am a newly acquired Shakira fan, and I am not easily impressed.

068817776X|4.0|In \\"The Nazi Officer's Wife,\\" Edith Hahn describes how she grew up with her parents and sisters in Vienna in the 1920's.  Vienna in those days was a magical, picturesque and sophisticated place.  This lovely city was filled with sunny caf&eacute;s, cultural activities and daring intellectuals. Although the undercurrents of anti-Semitism were present in Vienna even then, Jews and gentiles coexisted side by side in peace.<br /><br />In 1938, Edith's world was turned upside down.  The German army marched into Austria; the Austrians voted for \\"Anschluss\\" or union with Germany.  After the Nazis took over, everything changed for Edith and her family.  German thugs ruled the streets and laws were passed which tightened the noose around Jewish necks day by day.  Some members of Edith's family escaped Austria before conditions deteriorated any further.  Edith remained in Austria and was sent to do forced labor at a farm and later at a work camp.<br /><br />How did Edith ultimately avoid deportation?  With the help of some friends, she obtained forged papers declaring her to be an Aryan of pure blood.  At the age of twenty-eight, she married a Nazi party member named Werner Vetter and spent the war years in Brandenburg, Germany, as a dutiful \\"Aryan\\" wife and mother.<br /><br />How could any woman live such a lie?  Although Edith at times hated herself for her deception, she felt that her actions were justifiable under the circumstances. Is Edith Hahn's story an honest and courageous tale of survival against all odds, or is it the memoir of a cowardly woman who sold out in order to save herself?  Each reader must answer this difficult question for himself.

0385503954|5.0|Ian McEwan's new novel, \\"Atonement,\\" starts out quietly.  The time is the summer of 1935, and we meet the Tallis clan, a wealthy British family living in the countryside.  McEwan skillfully describes how certain key members of the household think and feel about their lives.  Thirteen-year-old Briony is lively, imaginative and spoiled.  She is desperate to be the center of attention.  Her older sister, Cecilia, a recent Cambridge graduate, is undecided about her future.  Their mother, Emily, whose husband neglects her, is often bedridden with severe migraines.<br /><br />Robbie Turner, the son of a servant, has graduated from Cambridge.  Robbie and Cecilia have always been friends, but their relationship is about to move to another level.  Subsequently, a series of unfortunate events occur that culminate in a thoughtless act that has devastating consequences.<br /><br />McEwan captures small moments that speak volumes about the characters.  For example, there is an angry scene between the cook and Emily, in which Emily orders the cook to change a menu that she had slaved over on a wretchedly hot day.  The anger and intensity that is generated in this scene says a great deal about the way some members of the British upper classes viewed their servants in 1935.  In another scene, Cecilia changes outfits again and again before an evening party, convinced that what she wears will fundamentally change her in some way.  McEwan is subtly showing us that the Tallis clan, in spite of their wealth and privilege, are fundamentally insecure and uncomfortable in their own skins.  They know on some level that their lives are shallow and meaningless, but they are powerless to change.<br /><br />The book moves forward through time, following the Tallises through World War II.  The scenes of battle are  bloody and graphic, unlike the first part of the novel, which was quiet and understated.  The author skillfully demonstrates how the upheaval of Second World War brought about an irrevocable transformation in both individuals and society.  Nothing could possibly remain the same after this monumental conflict.<br /><br />However, McEwan points out, certain realities remain immutable.  People cannot always gain atonement for the sins that they commit.  Individuals may make up excuses for their misdeeds, but they cannot undo the past.  \\"Atonement\\" is a novel of astonishing virtuosity, strong descriptive writing, and an ending that will shock you.

B00005MP58|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the world's Great Books. It's a timeless classic. But, this good and faithful BBC translation of Ms. Austen's vision gives us only good television. Good television is nothing to sneer at, of course; still, to experience the true genius of Pride and Prejudice you'll need to read the book.<br />Perhaps the BBC have done the best that can be expected here. The acting, sets, costumes, screenplay, casting and music are pretty faultless--nonetheless, my viewing experience doesn't even approximate the intellectual &amp; emotional pleasures I receive while reading the book. I suspect that viewers who have praised this miniseries so highly are people who have already read the book, and who are adding their remembered reading experience to whatever is missing in the tv viewing experience. There is a pleasure in knowing what should happen next, what the characters should do and say, and then having it more or less come true; if it doesn't, exactly, because our mental images are always more ideal and fuzzier than reality, our disappointment is tempered as long as what we see on the screen doesn't actually ruin what we remember from reading the book.<br />Jennifer Ehle is a lovely, smart actor; still, I am never convinced that her Lizzy is so very smart, funny, good and beautiful as to have shattered Mr. Darcy so thoroughly. Perhaps this adaptation's prime flaw is that it skimps on its portrayal of Miss Bennet's and Mr. Darcy's interactions at Rosings Park: in the novel, they spend much more time together than is shown here, so that his eventual proposal is better understood. At Pemberly, too, neither the full scope of Darcy's astonishing and obvious partiality to Miss Bennet, nor the Gardners' amazed reactions, are truly shown. Also neglected are the very funny, revealing conversations between the two lovers which follow their engagement in the novel, where Elizabeth explains to Darcy exactly why he loves her so much: these are some of Pride &amp;Prejudices best scenes, and their omission is barely tolerable.<br />But, these objections (and others I've not mentioned) are by no means fatal flaws. This is very good television that sometimes rises to excellence; it's even better for someone who's read the book. Finally, though, had the book itself never been written--had this been an original screenplay--it could hardly be considered a work of genius. Still, I recommend it.
B000002MNL|5.0|Morrissey reaches the soul of feelings and experience of being gay and the everything from the day to day personal experiences,to family ties to relationships...and even loosing someone you love. The good and the bad of an alternatve lifestyle in this world. His voice is sexy, and masculine.

I hope he will continue with his bold style of music which I know many others enjoy also.
B00003CXXO|4.0|Well, with a team like Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, and actors like William Hurt and Haley Joel Osment, it's hard to go wrong in a film involving them.  And for the most part, that's true.<br />AI is loosely a futuristic Pinocchio, complete with character equivalents of Geppetto (Dr. Hobby/Monica) and Jiminy Cricket (a walking, talking \\"supertoy\\" teddy bear).  David, a \\"mecha\\" robot child, designed to bond and unconditionally love the foster family in which he is placed, is ultimately abandoned by his \\"mother,\\" Monica, due to a serious of misunderstood events.  This happens in a particularly disturbing scene where Monica chooses to leave David in the forest rather than return him to the company that made him, presumably sparing him of being dismantled and offering him a chance to survive.  This is perhaps one of the most difficult scenes I've ever had to watch, in which the nightmare of every child- abandonment by his mother- is acted out, as David literally clings to his mother while she, distraught and filled with conflicting emotions, gets in her car and zooms away.  If you don't feel for David at this point- and it's hard not to- the rest of the film may seem pointless.  At any rate, David's journey truly begins.<br />David finds himself outrunning \\"stray robot\\" catchers but is eventually caught.  He winds up as the main attraction at a \\"flesh fair,\\" a futuristic Christians-to-the-lions type sporting event, where humans, in a barabaric display of retaliation against technology, do terrible things to robots, like shoot them through cannons and dump acid on them.  David escapes his doom and makes off with another \\"mecha,\\" gigolo Joe, a robot-cum-male prostitute.  Joe briefly \\"educates\\" David on the ways of the world, and helps him to accomplish his mission:  to find the blue fairy, who will make him a real boy, so that his mother will take him back.  <br />David learns that he must find Dr. Hobby, the man who actually created him as a prototype for the series of child robots he hopes to market. He finds Hobby in a polar-cap flooded Manhattan, where he realizes that, contrary to what he has been told, he is not unique, as he views rows of robots like himself awaiting activation. <br />Without spoiling the ending, David completes his journey, but in a most unexpected way, leaving viewers with some serious questions about what just happened.  Nevertheless, the ending is spellbinding and touching.<br />The film is a social commentary on the gradual but sure increase of how technology supplants the need for humans, and a more subtle treatise on how humans are spending less time talking to one another, and more time obsessing over material things.  Even deeper, it touches on our basic need to be loved, and, despite our flaws, the apparent ingenuity of the human race.  In fact, this last point serves as a metaphor for the film's quality:  flawed, but ingenious, nonetheless.<br />All of this is thinly disguised at times and at others quite blatant through the use of imagery and dialogue.  Visually, the film is a unique mix of directorial styles: Kubrick's violent and enigmatic surrealism, and Spielberg's childlike and sentimental but hopeful vision.   The social commentary is set against a backdrop of eerie futurism, complete with human-like robots, spaceship-looking streetcars, and neon-drenched cities of earthly pleasures.  <br />AI is a also curious juxtaposition of many of the great sci-fi movies like E.T., Close Encounters, Bladerunner, and Contact, and the harsh surrealism that defines Kubrick movies such as A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey.  At its core, though, is the fundamental yearning that humans have to be loved, the struggle in dealing with tragedy, and the technology vs. people-power battle. The film, however, does send some mixed messages about happiness being dependent upon the love of someone else.  There are also some inexplicable plot twists that seem too convenient for the story.  As might be expected in a Spielberg film, though, the special effects are marvelous yet organic as opposed to showy.  Also, John Williams' (who else?) score captures the mood of the movie with childlike melodies and haunting soundscapes.  All in all, AI is a fascinating fusion of science-fiction, intense drama, visual wonder, and a story that is steeped in humanity.
B00005JKYS|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the best war film to come out in a long, long time.  It's non-fiction without patriotic propoganda or nostalgic, or preachiness, like 'Pearl Harbor,' and 'Saving Private Ryan.'  Despite the comments of some reviewers, this movie wasn't promoting patriotism.  It was a highly technical portrayal of modern battle, and the concequences of sending your troops into battle.  If anything, the movie was somewhat of a tragedy, because despite the altruism of Lt. Col Hal Moore and his men, their actions would ultimately be in vain.<br /><br />The movie was a refreshing 'Nam film because it focused on the war at its very outset, when the troops being sent there didn't think of the war we do now.  At the time, it was just another American war in which we'll go, fight for our country, and come out victorious, like always.  But even in this movie, you can see where politics and institutionalized stupidity were creeping into the Army.  Just look for the scene, when Moore is desperately needed on the ground to, A: Conduct the battle, B: Matintain the morale, trust and confidence of his men, and C: for moral reasons, his commander tries to recall him to Saigon so Gen. Westmoreland can have a 'briefing.'  WTF?  It's a credit to Moore's character and leadership qualities that he told the brass to go screw themselves.  Doing so meant he put the lives of his men above his own, and above his own career.<br /><br />As a military vet, I knew a lot of officers who would have jumped at the chance to get out of that hell hole.  Fortunately, I knew an equal amount who would have said, \\"You want a briefing?  Fly down here and we'll 'brief' you!\\"  The latter types were the only ones who instilled loyalty in their men.  The fish rots from the head.  If you have a bunch of great guys with a lousy leader, you're going to have a lousy unit, no matter what.  But even if you have a bunch of jerks with a great leader, you can have a great unit.  Moore's presence on the battlefield was probably essential to their victory.  When troops are patted on the back by their CO, it's a huge boost in confidence and morale.  When the CO is never around, or even worse, is gone, the rumor mill starts flying, troops feel like 'they' (the officers) aren't trustworthy, and that the soldiers are fighting for the wrong reasons.  Moore was the type of commander who would never let his troops think about the battalion terms of 'us' (enlisted) and 'them' (officers).  Moore's troops thought of the battalion as 'us.'<br /><br />I saw a couple discrepencies in the film at first glance.  1 - a soldier getting on the bus in Georgia with a magazine in his rifle.  No way.  2 - I'm 95% sure they had metal canteens in 65, but they had plastic ones in the movie.<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure why the soldiers didn't dig in on the perimeter.  They maintained a perimeter for a long time, overnight even, and in my training we would always dig, dig, dig anytime you stop and hold turf.<br /><br />I liked how the Vietnamese were portrayed.  Despite having no air support and no artillery they fought as well as they could, and tried to 'hug the belt' of the Americans.  This lead the Americans to call in air support on themselves, leading to casualties.  It was good when they showed how scared the Vietnamese were, because in most movies they're portrayed as being somehow ghost-like, inhuman, when in fact they were damn scared, just like our guys.  Going against American firepower, not to mention guys who are physically up to twice your weight and on average six inches taller, took a lot of nerve.<br /><br />Overall a great film.  It showed the US Military in its 60s prime, the tragic consequnces of using military force, and it also showed the home front, and how military wives are actually part of the battles we fight.  I highly recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />-- JJ Timminsthe battlefield was probably essential to their victory.

Moore was the type of commander who would never let his troops think about the battalion terms of 'us' (enlisted) and 'them' (officers).  Moore's troops thought of the battalion as 'us.'<BR><br /><BR>I saw a couple discrepencies in the film at first glance.  1 - a soldier getting on the bus in Georgia with a magazine in his rifle.  No way.  2 - I'm 95% sure they had metal canteens in 65, but they had plastic ones in the movie.  <BR><br /><BR>Also, I'm not sure why the soldiers didn't dig in on the perimeter.  They maintained a perimeter for a long time, overnight even, and in my training we would always dig, dig, dig anytime you stop and hold turf.<br /><br /><BR>I liked how the Vietnamese were portrayed.  Despite having no air support and no artillery they fought as well as they could, and tried to 'hug the belt' of the Americans.  This lead the Americans to call in air support on themselves, leading to casualties.  It was good when they showed how scared the Vietnamese were, because in most movies they're portrayed as being somehow ghost-like, inhuman, when in fact they were damn scared, just like our guys.  Going against American firepower, not to mention guys who are physically up to twice your weight and on average six inches taller, took a lot of nerve.<BR><br /><BR>Overall a great film.  It showed the US Military in its 60s prime, the tragic consequnces of using military force, and it also showed the home front, and how military wives are actually part of the battles we fight.  I highly recommend this to anyone.<BR><br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B000002H38|5.0|To put it simply, \\"Rapture\\" is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time.  It's hard to believe when listening to it that it's 15 years old.  It remains as fresh today as the first time I listened to it in 1987, and I was only a junior in high school.  This album is for anyone and is a must have in any serious music collection.
0783217048|4.0|I have to say that Snipes, Swayze and Leguizamo looked pretty darn good in drag. The incident with Sherrif Dullard - oops! - Dollard was hilarious, especially that little Cinderella bit with<BR>the shoe. I think this was the best I've seen Stockard Channing do. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedies about road trips, friendship, and what friends can and will do for each<BR>other.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|It's absolutely unbelievable that Iron Maiden are still putting out music that's this good more than twenty years after their first album.  By now they've more than proven themselves one of the strongest bands in the history of popular music.  Instrumentalism is excellent here, and Bruce Dickinson's vocals are still as strong as ever.  If you liked metal in the 80s, Brave New World should be in your collection.  Iron Maiden has progressed a little over the years, but BNW is completely untarnished with the alternative sound that messed everything up so badly in the nineties.  This is the same old Maiden, still kicking [it].<br />Highlights are: The Wicker Man, Brave New World, The Mercenary, Out of the Silent Planet.  Every song is good!
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is truly an awesome album.  With lyrics ranging from the insight of a person in an institution, to the pain and agony of heroin addiction, and then to a saddened perspective of a lost soul in a war, this album has everything.  Heavy, hard, and fast riffs that dominate this album make you get up and move around, and then there are the soft melodic parts that make you fall back in your seat.<br />Trust me, when you get to \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", crank the volume on your stereo system.  ;-)<br />This album is truly something magnificent, and deserves to be in anyone's record collection, a fan of metal or not.  From start to finish, this album has the ability to satisfy anyone even remotely interested in metal.  If you haven't picked up Master of Puppets, I suggest you go out and buy it today!
B000063DI9|5.0|WOW!!!  Iron Maiden's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is fantastic!  Everything Iron Maiden has ever tried to do is accomplished on this album completely.  Fantastic guitar riffs mingle with infectious choruses on every song.  EVERY SONG is EXCELLENT!!!  If you like metal at all, you MUST buy this record.  In addition to being a classic for it's time, Iron Maiden's SSoaSS has provided inspiration for some of the premiere acts in heavy metal today, including Nocturnal Rites, Jag Panzer, HammerFall, Blind Guardian, and Iced Earth.  Anybody who likes any of these bands should own SSoaSS, as it's the album that set things in motion.<br />As if the music alone weren't enough reason to buy SSoaSS, this enhanced version of the CD also includes music videos for Can I Play With Madness? and The Evil That Men Do, as well as multimedia paraphernalia galore, including album information, band bio, and an extensive collection of photographs.
B0000524CY|5.0|When this movie first came out in the early seventies, there was a lot of hype about it, and I never understood it until the first shocking scenes flash before my eyes. Then I was a believer.<br /> We first meet Lankester Merrin as an archeologist in Northern Iraq. He is the man who will later be the film's title character. But while in Iraq, he unearths an ancient artifact, the spirit it represents perhaps as old as time itself. He has faced this enemy before, and he will have to again. The last things we see before fading to Georgetown is the squaring off of two old foes, a chilling foreshadow of things to come.<br />Very little of the story to follow is actually about Merrin. Rather, it shifts alternately between two story lines. One involves actress Chris MacNeil and her 12-year-old daughter Regan, while the second centers around Damien Karras, a priest who feels he's lost his faith.<br />...<br />As one of the film's theatrical trailers puts it, what happens to Regan-flawlessly portrayed by Linda Blair-is almost incomprehensible. When she speaks, we hear an impossibly low voice, clearly that of a man, and through Blair's performance, we feel that we're seeing the Devil, too. And we can't wait to see Father Merrin and Father Karras triumph over the beast.<br />It wasn't just the special effects that haunted me days or even weeks after I saw this film. Because what you see on a movie screen is gone as soon as the movie ends and the house lights come up. It was what the film represented--the idea that an unwanted spirit can invade someone you love and turn them into something hideous--that affirmed my belief that there is a constant battle between good and evil in this world. It's an idea that left me watching and waiting, perhaps terrified of my return to bed in the middle of the night, and having to face a monstrous little girl who would kill me by twisting my head around, as happened to one of the film's characters.<br />I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie. If I had to guess, I'd place it close to ten. And it gets more scary every time, right up there with John Carpenter's &#34;Prince of Darkness,&#34; from 1987. I recently obtained the newest DVD version, the one with footage not seen in the original release. I highly recommend it for a night of edge-of-your-seat thrills you won't soon forget.
0783226160|5.0|ok so im in a mix on best comedie ever. its either sorority boys or this. i was flipping channels last night only to find this movie. i had heard that it was funny so i was like oh what the heck. it was very funny. it has lots of famous faces in it.  ok so its crazy.  im a 17 year old that would watch this every day if i owned it.
B00005RY7X|3.0|This is the most refreshingly entertaining album to be played on mtv and the radio in a long time. this isn't great music, and doesnt take much talent, but it's cachy, reminiscent of the 80's(which is a good thing), and is just party music. so all you self proclaimed \\"music critics\\" need to step back, cool out, and party hard.
B00005JKEC|2.0|Tediously written and dialogue heavy. It would have been better as a play than a movie, with so much dialogue. And Ethan Hawke is really miscast...he's frail and pale and totally unbelievable as an L.A.P.D. cop. Denzel Washington's performance is contrived. He's not believable as a hard manipulator. I know he won the Oscar. But I still think his performance falls short.
B000062Y98|5.0|FINALLY Blind Guardian has surpassed \\"Imaginations From the Other side\\" after nearly 10 YEARS!!! BG's \\"A Night at the Opera\\" is the most ambitious epic kick your face in album I have ever heard!! It trully is their greatest album to date. I must have listened to this album about 25 times in the past 5 days... In my opinion, Dream Theater's 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance' and Blind Guardian's A Night at the Opera are the two MUST HAVE'S of 2002(DT and BG are my personal fave bands). From the opening track--Precious Jeruslam--you know you are in for the ride of your life... Every single song is just as catchy as the next, you will find yourself singing along after the 2nd or 3rd listen to this album. Those of you that were hoping for something heavier and crunchier then Nightfall on Middle Earth, look no further then ANATO--- your mind will be boogled at the layers of shreds, phenominal unearthy guitar solos, double kick drum beats, and epic story writing. There is a reason why no band can even hold a candle to Blind Guardian...I've searched and searched.. I must have heard every epic symphonic power thrash metal out there.. NO ONE WILL EVER TOP THE MIGHTY BLIND GUARDIAN!! And a Night at the Opera proves it all!! Blind Guardian will joust any other band you will ever have known... JUST BUY THIS ALBUM...and then buy BG's Imaginations From the Other Side!!
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul McCartney is on one helluva roll...too bad many people aren't noticing. The first time I listened to this cd, I wasn't sure what to think..it is so different from all of his other releases. Its great to hear him taking risks again. 'Rinse The Raindrops' is borderline prog! But its great. If I could compare it to any previous release - it would have to be 'Ram'. Keep up the great work Paul!
B000009QOC|5.0|This is Glenn's best album so far (though,they are all great.)<BR>The first three songs are some of his best stuff, and 777 is one of the best tracks on the album. If you are a fan of metal music then this album should definitly be a must for your collection!
0784010501|5.0|NOTE: For TRUE Madonna fans only.<br />I really enjoyed watching this. I'm a BIG Madonna fan. TRUTH OR DARE revolves around her \\"BLONDE AMBITION TOUR\\"-her difficulties before the show, during the show, after the show, etc. All the movie is shown in black & white except for her performances (\\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"holiday\\", \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"Vogue\\", \\"Causing a Commotion\\" and \\"Family Affair\\"). Of course, TRUTH OR DARE shows Madonna's goodtimes with Donna, Nikki, and all her dancers. She calls them all her family. OK. I don't think I should give away anymore. Overall the movie is great. Madonna is wonderful and she still is. If you're Madonna fan, BUY THIS. She is a Goddess and the Queen of Pop. WE LOVE YOU MADONNA!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is a band that you will either love or hate. You will not \\"like\\" them.. Lateralus is the best Tool album so far. A progressive rock diamond based on the classic guitar-bass-drum \\"system\\". Every note on this CD is played very professionaly. Heavy clean guitars, extreme bass and drums from outer space. Lateralus creates it's own dark, melancholic atmosphere and that's where its secret is. BUY OR DIE!!!
B00005UKKF|5.0|You probably will think i'm being biased because i am such a big britney fan, but this video is amazing.  if you are deciding whether to buy it or not then trust me, you won't be wasting your money.  britney is sooo hot and this performance is out of this world.
B000062X90|4.0|In the early to mid 70's guitar rock was blues based and if there were two good guitarists in a band chances are that band sounded like The Allman Brothers or some variation.<br />Wishbone Ash started in blues based songs but had a penchant for English folk and jazz. By this third album they had a loyal following that appreciated their ability to boogie but to be able to play pretty songs. To Wishbone Ash's credit much of this had to do with their stellar playing which was more based in minor key work than traditional blues. Django Reinhart was more of an influence than say Eric Clapton.<br />On Argus the boys made their progressive album. Several songs were in the six minute plus range and featured multi sectioned arrangements. In particular Time Was, Sometime World, Throw Down The Sword and Warrior brought a mixture of progressive rock and some complex and engaging harmonized guitar work. Besides this guitarists Andy Powell and Ted Turner had unique qualities that made them easy to identify but were capable of working together in a way that made it hard to figure out who was playing what.<br />That might seem a guitar geek's kind of compliment but really it had more to do with both guitarists desire to keep their work musicial and within the framework of the song which was not always typical of 70's guitar based music. Not to say there aren't some great solos, there are. They were so compelling that as a young guitar player I spent a great deal of time figuring out what they did because it was so unusual.<br />A lot of other players must have done the same as the harmonies, phrasing and solo styles in many hard rock bands seem to have adopted this sophisticated style of playing.<br />Beyond the skill of the guitarists bassist Martin Turner played what can be described as lead bass, often letting the guitar duo hold the rhythm together with drummer Steve Upton (who had a flair for understated jazz oriented playing). The singing is excellent with Martin Turner doingmost of the lead vocals along with Powell and Ted Turner on harmonies.<br />To a minor degree there are moments where the songs may seem dated in spots. This is more to the overplay of many of the ideas heard on this record expoited by bands of lesser quality. Critics were often divided about Wishbone Ash probably because they varied styles on each album. From a historical standpoint this band was making music that influenced other bands but never got the kind of reception their followers had.<br />Worth checking out if you like classic rock, melodic guitar playing or for historical interest. Almost a five star effort, I wish we could give out half stars. This is album is a solid 4.5
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie portrayed Harry Potter at it's best. I loved their casting especially Tom Felton(Draco). I LOVE this movie with a pashion and it should be a house hold item that every family owns. I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love. I want towatch it again and again and again and again and agian.
1558908455|2.0|I thought this movie could have been much better. It started out pretty good with George Clooney adding to another overly voilet crime/drama movie. The second half of the movie could have been interesting too but turned gruesome without any reason other than to make the viewer be bombarded with scene after scene of gore. Thank goodness for Salma's brief inclusion in an overwise dismal last hour of pure violence and little to nada storyline. She is beautiful! If you felt foolish for wasting your money on this as a rental, by ALL means, rewind the scene to see the almost magical dance bit with Salma to help forget what horribly unsatisying moments follow!
0783230621|4.0|Dante's Peak is one of the BEST movies that I have ever seen that has Pierce Brosnan (for Brosnan fans), and a movie that is based on a natural disaster.  Anyone who likes action movies, along with scientific stuff, Pierce Brosnan, and love stories would LOVE this movie.  The only thing that bothers me is that the rubber on the tires melt extremely quickly and wouldn't be able to continue keeping its shape after being burned.  But other than that, this is a great movie!
B00005JKED|2.0|I'm very pleased that I only RENTED this movie. Why this was worth an Oscar is a mystery to me. As the DVD doesn't contain any \\"extras\\" disregarding the usual trailers stuff, this really isn't a Collectors DVD.<br />The movie never gets around to a motive for the actions. There is ths good guy and this bad guys. The good guy could have gone away from the bad guy many times before the action really starts. But why the good guy stays around the bad guy seems a real mystery. Why the bad guy is a bad guy is obviously not interesting as we never even get a hint why someone becomes corrupt and crazy as Denzel plays.<br />The actors are fine (not great) - I have a problem with the story line. It's clear that lots and lots of background scenes have been cut out leaving you with an empty feeling and not really enganged in the movie as it runs.<br />If you don't believe me - rent it first - it's not worth owning.
B00005JKEC|4.0|This was a kick [buttox], gritty, dark, well acted movie. Denzel gave the performance of his career, (plus he finally won a best actor oscar) while Hawke finally got to show people how under-rated an actor he really is, in a perfect role for him. The only minor problems were a few scenes at the end, where the writing could have been a little bit tighter, instead of dissolving into more of a typical action flick... but other than that, TD was one of the best films of 2001. Hopefully, Denzel can win another oscar for John Q, and keep making good movies.
6305903182|4.0|The third time around, The Ghostface Killer is slashing down the cast of Stab 3. This third entry remains surprisingly clever at times, despite not featuring a single genuine scare. The characters have become endearing (mainly Arquette and Neve Campbell), Parker Posey's performance is a riot, and there are several very funny moments. There's enough high-energy slasher action to make this an overall satisfying entry into the series. Like the previous sequel, the finale is too silly (Though the build-up and payoff is still better executed).<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****
0440224764|1.0|This book was really good-until page 460! If you read this book make up your own ending-don't read Grisham's! I hope his other books don't have such a bad ending! I don't plan to read another book of his until i hear otherwise.  If all his books have such an awful ending i don't plan on reading any of them! I was all excited about what would happen to Patrick and Eva- until the ending! Ruin the whole book why don't ya Grisham! I think all your book sales have gone to your head!
1558908498|3.0|Neve Campbell is once again stalked by the Ghostface killer, this time on a college campus.  Sequel to the highly popular original has some mildly clever moments and is fairly engaging with a few suspenseful moments. But Kevin Williamson's script is a little often too inane (Particularly in the finale) and Craven's attempts at jump-in-your-seat shocks are far, far too obvious.  Mostly middling fare.<BR>** 1/2 out of *****
B00005B4GU|1.0|I'd like to forget this album in a big way!  Some elitist record execs and every other burt-out rock critic love these guys.  These are the same people that did a great deal of drugs in the 60's and 70's folks and it is coming back to haunt US!<br />Never buy this ablum unless you are given six months to live and want death to seem like a pleasant alternative to something here on Earth!  In that case, listen to this CD, watch Rosanne Barr sing the National Anthem, and watch the News on Public Television.  <br />How high up am I?<br />P@
6305428220|4.0|Six students discover their school is being overrun by parasitic aliens that take over their hosts.  Lightning-paced thrill ride is as entertaining as they come, full of exciting action, some nail-biting suspense, and a lot of good laughs.  Robert Rodriguez's frenetic direction and the first-rate cast (Robert Patrick, Josh Hartnett, and Elijah Wood are the standouts) solidify this sci-fi/horror film.  Kevin Williamson's script is annoyingly &quot;hip&quot; at times and the movie gets a little too silly when it references past genre films, but these are minor flaws compared to what works so well.  Highly recommended, even if you're not a fan of the 90's post-Scream horror/thrillers.
B000007MVD|5.0|If you don't have this cd, get it. This is one of the finest collections of songs that I have ever heard. It is hard to believe that these songs were performed live for radio. Many of the songs are recording studio quality. The song 'I'll Be On My Way' was worth the price of the entire cd.
0385484518|5.0|Mitch Albom's 1997 book Tuesday's With Morrie has become an instant classic and for good reason. The story chronicles Albom's belated reunion with a favorite college professor, Morrie Schwartz who was dying of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) in 1994. The reunion was sparked by an interview Morrie did with Nightline, while a strike at Albom's Detroit newspaper freed up his time.<br />Seeing his old professor suffering the ravages of ALS convinced Albom to visit him weekly (every Tuesday) to finish \\"his final thesis\\" with Morrie. Their \\"last course\\" is about the meaning of life, from the perspective of a dying man. Morrie lets Albom and the rest of us in on what's ultimately important in life and it's unfortunately not the things majority of us spend most of our time on.<br />Morrie is without self pity, but openly shares his pains and his losses as his world shrinks before Mitch Albom's eyes. The old professor talks openly about both the things he misses and of those things that are most important in life, cultivating love and friendships, enjoying yourself (Morrie loved to dance) and appreciating the beauty all around us.<br />As the weeks go by, Morrie's disease moves up his body, starting at his feet, than his legs and upward. One of the indignities that Morrie fears most is \\"the [fanny] wipe test,\\"...After that it'll be my ability to talk and finally my ability to breathe...I'll suffocate.\\"<br />With every visit, Morrie explained to Albom how far the disease had spread and used subtle tricks to help his student show affection. They talked a wide range of subjects, from money, to marriage, to our culture and death itself. Some of the lessons may seem almost obvious, even simplistic, but if they were so obvious, everyone would be living a balanced life.<br />In one meeting, Morrie explains how he got through it all, by experiencing each emotion, then letting it go. \\"There are mornings that I cry about all the things I've lost, but then I step back and say, `So, this is grief,\\" and I feel it, then let it go and move on to other emotions.\\"<br />On his last visit, Morrie spoke only with great effort and Albom was faced with giving up any hope of the miraculous. He looked at the struggling old teacher, he referred to as \\"coach\\" and said,<br />\\"I don't know how to say goodbye.\\"<br />Morrie held his student's hand and pressed it close to his heaving chest and replied,<br />\\"This...is...how we...say...goodbye.\\"<br />Albom observed a snort from his old teacher over an apparent final triumph - Morrie had finally gotten him to cry.<br />Through Albom's words, Morrie Schwartz left us all a great gift...a pathway to a fuller and more meaningful life.grief,\\" and I feel it, then let it go and move on to other emotions.\\"<br />On his last visit, Morrie spoke only with great effort and Albom was faced with giving up any hope of the miraculous.

0385503954|5.0|Buy this book and find yourself a well lit corner and start reading.  Do not read any more reviews; too much information.  I had no idea what I was getting into and as I turned each page I had to train my eye to stick to the sentence I was reading and not skip ahead.  I won't say another word.  The author should feel very proud of his work.
B00004RIUV|5.0|This is a great album. I still have a copy of the vintage vinyl disc and recently bought the CD. When I originally picked this album up, it was based on Clark's reputation forged as one of the original members of The Byrds, but this album is nothing like the folk-rock that worked so well for groups like the Byrds, Poco and the Eagles.<br />The entire album has a haunting melancholy tone that never boarders on brooding...no mean feat. The music almost defies category, in that it is not traditional or classic rock, certainly not folk, not blues nor even jazz, but some fusion that combines elements of most of those forms.<br />There are so many tracks that stay with you long after you've stopped listening. Two that come to mind are Silver Phial and  the title track, No Other.<br />Sadly, for Clark, No Other was not that well received and he has never come close to making such an original musical statement again. I love this album. I'd recomend it without exception to anyone, even though those who buy it expecting to hear the Gene Clark of the Byrds will hear an altogether different Gene Clark.
B000002C1V|5.0|All I have to say is that this album has some of the beszt floyd Lyrics ever complemented by smooth sax solos and short Gilmour guitar riffs.  Listen to possible pasts, Gunners Dream, Southampton Dock, the title track and trhe last song and tell me this isnt a great album. I dare ya
B000002UDB|5.0|Any Beatles CD deserves SUPIOR ratings!! This album has wonderful songs on it -- anywhere from I am the Walrus to All You Need is Love -- I feel so relaxed when I listen to this album!!!
0780623134|5.0|After reading other reviews, I find it amusing that only a few people found this movie less then at least 4 stars. My guess is those users favorite movie is something like The Cable Guy or Scary Movie. That or they just don't get it. In any case, this is my favorite movie. <br />Shawshank if perfectly acted and directed. I find myself mumbling and laughing to myself, drawing attention from others, while watching this movie. I'm usually saying &quot;This is my favorite part.&quot; The beer scene and ending are my &quot;real&quot; favorites though.<br />If you haven't seen the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and get the movie, you won't regret it.
0312263120|1.0|Don't bother with this book if you know anything about encryption or computer security (or the NSA). The author apparently did no background research in the subject.  Aside from the lack of technical realism, the story line is simplistic and the alleged thrills overblown, unless exclamation points count for excitement.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Pearl Harbor, though it was trashed by every review I read, is actually not that bad of a film. Many of the more &quot;emotional&quot; scenes that are included throughout the film, however, are not needed and only help with one thing: the viewer's boredom. All in all, though, the action scenes are visually and mentally stunning. They are easily the high point of the film. I mean, let's face it, people like Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer were born to make films like &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;The Rock,&quot; not emotional dramas such as this. Had there been a better screenwriter (sorry Randall Wallace) and maybe a different director that was more accustomed to the type of film that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; tries to become, this film would have been excellent. Alas, this simple wish was not granted, and we are left with this entertaining yet boring, amazing yet dull action film.
B00005R2M3|4.0|It's an &quot;alright&quot; album..i recommend it if you are a huge Shakira fan..but if you only like the singles out now..i won't recommend it becoz the songs on the album aren't as great as those. But it was a good album overall.
B000002GQE|5.0|HERE IT IS ! It has got it all; pop, rock, orchestral, lyrics, bringing the melodies from rock of the sixties into the future. It is not fair to pick one track, its a complete string of masterpiece. The arrangement is unique also today. The songs glide into symphonies and back. If you are a music listener you have to listen to this.

0684857219|1.0|This book will mislead most novice bodybuilders.  Arnold's training regimine worked for him because of the steroids he took. A natural lifter using his training program will become severely overtrained in a matter of a month or two.  Arnolds lifting information is from when he competed in the 70's and the field has matured scientifically since then.  Arnold's principles are not backed up by sound research.  I do not recommend this book.  A better book would be the NSCA's Essentials of Strength and Conditioning.

0446677450|2.0|Kiyosaki is both right & wrong, but more wrong than right. Where he's right is that to get out of the rat race, you must put your money into assets that will produce income. This is such a simple truth, but a very powerful one, and Kiyosaki brings it home quite well (especially his graphics). <br />Where he's wrong is what to do with life once you've got enough assets to quit working. His book reeks of greed, condescending attitudes, ungratefulness, and a never-ending spirit of \\"more more more.\\" How sad that he spits on his father's grave by immortalizing him as \\"poor dad\\" -- just to sell some books. He is so money-hungry, so focused on material goods, that he sells his soul in the process. It was curiously revolting.<br />If you want to read a book that also tells you how to build assets so that you can leave the rat race -- but with a VERY different conception of what to do with yourself once you've achieved that goal -- then read YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE. It's 180 degree different from this book in attitude and gratitude.<br />I appreciated this book's reminder to build assets (and not get pulled into liabilities) -- but I was saddened and actually felt pity for this guy who has sold himself for a porsche or two. Like I said, he's absolutely right and dead wrong.
B000060P79|5.0|When I first heard the song &quot;When I'm With You&quot; a couple of months ago, I fell in love with these Canadian boys. This cd contains 12 songs that can match anyones mood and songs like &quot;Just A Kid&quot; &quot;Perfect&quot; and &quot;God Must Hate Me&quot; makes it easy for teens to relate to. I'm so proud of these boys for creating such an AWESOME cd and i recommend it to anyone!
0140434089|4.0|The Moonstone was an awesome book. I really like mysteries and this one was especially good because it came from the point of view of so many of the characters involved. It let you see everyone's personality from different perspectives so that you could judge which character had the mind of a criminal. My favorite character was probably Gabriel Betteredge because he was really quirky. His devotion to Robinson Crusoe and distrust of anyone who would not believe in it were amusing. He was the most informative narrator with respect to the time period. I learned the most about the treatment of women and servants during the mid-1800s from his portion of the novel. I think Rosanna Spearman's irrational conduct where Mr. Franklin was concerned was a bit beyond belief. I doubt that any servant would expect attention from a man from the upper-class society or that she would have gone to the lengths she did when her feelings weren't reciprocated from a man she had known such a very short while. I didn't like the part narrated by Miss Clack as much as I liked the rest of the book because her evangelical attitude kept getting in the way of the plot. It may be normal or slightly humorous to other readers, but it really annoyed me. I didn't particularly like Rachel Verinder because she never should have agreed to marry Mr. Ablewhite while in love with another man. At first, when Mr. Jennings experiment was introduced, I felt like it was all nonsense, but I didn't mind the scene too much because the improbable experiment didn't reveal the whereabouts of the diamond and the plot continued despite the interruption of Mr. Jenning's test. I wish Wilkie Collins had cleared up the mystery of Ezra Jennings' past. I would have liked the book better had we learned who the person he had saved his money for was and possibly what the crime he was never absolved of could have been. I liked the final solution to the disappearance of the moonstone, but I think it could have been more creative. Ithink the best mysteries are the ones in which the criminal is above suspicion until the very moment the author reveals the truth to his reader.
0316921173|5.0|When I began this amazingly good book I hated it completly and thoroughly.  I felt like the book was sent over an instant messager from Wallace to his editor, who would promptly send the paragraph to be published without reading it.  I thought Wallace was a talanted, but pomposu ..., too full of himself to show any restraint in his own writing.  Once I got to page 198 though, I was hooked.<br /><br />  I feel like if you just read from 198 to like 211 this section will really hook you and then you can start at the beginning.  The book's major failing is that it is like a good, no a great, album with a poor song order.  If a few sections were just switched around a little, the book would be a little easier to read.  All the good things people say about this book though are true.  It's complexly brilliant, surprisingly readable, hilarious and sad at the same time.<br /><br />  Get addicted to this book.
B00005R23S|4.0|If only this had been a beginning-to end-record of a complete Bruce Springsteen concert, it would have been perfect.  There is a show's worth of material, over three hours, but it's broken up and out of its normal order.<br />The first disc contains the complete HBO special from last year, along with special that features Bob Costas interviewing Bruce and the band.  The second disc contains 11 songs not included in the original special.  These are all the bonus tracks from the CD plus several more.<br />The first disc is great of course, and there's nothing wrong with the performances, but the material on the second disc is even better, with performances of &quot;Backstreets,&quot; &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town,&quot; &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Jungleland,&quot; &quot;Light of Day,&quot; &quot;Thunder Road&quot; and &quot;Ramrod.&quot;  I have a feeling that long time Springsteen fans will find themselves returning to the second disc more than the first.<br />This package contains some typically brilliant Springsteen performances, but I wish it had been organized into a more cohesive whole.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is one of the funnies movies i have seen in a long time.  IT is so funny because of the stuppidity and the way they demonstrate models.  Keeps you laughing the whole time especially teh gasoline fight.  Awesome dvd for teens at a party.
B000003S0I|5.0|This album will blow your mind.<br />It can't be described accurately. The closest I can get is that a bunch of classical musicians started listening to dark heavy metal albums and then recorded this one. (I know that's not what happened, but that's what it sounds like). <BR>1. \\"LTIAP1\\" Starting with Muir-dominated twinkling sounds, a noise grows and builds, finally erupting into that classic \\"DUH-DUH-DUH-DUH DUH DUH\\" riff that lets you know you're There. From what I've heard, the rest of the track is improvised. Sounds fabulous.<BR>2. \\"Book Of Saturday\\" In contrast, this track is extremely short. But who would have thought that a backwards guitar could escape from the stereotype of LSD-inspired tripping music and actually sound BEAUTIFUL?<BR>3. \\"Exiles\\" Based on his performance in this track alone, William Bruford is the greatest drummer EVER. Restrained understatement combined with transcendent grace. Simple fills.<BR>4. \\"Eay Money\\" Impressive build-up and fantastic solo. The sound at the beginning was made by David Cross plunging his fists into a bucket of mud and quickly pulling them out again.<BR>5+6. Here comes the mind-gnawing part - the longest crescendo I know of. And so perfectly controlled too. The crescendo ends with the sound of the larks getting their tongues cut off. And then the amazing part 2 to the title track comes on. More fantastic drumming by Bruford. Cross' best violin solo. And is that the last note of \\"The Heavenly Music Corporation\\" at the end?<BR>But it's great. My favorite Crimson album, even over their cosmically fabulous debut. It blows my mind.

0871137380|5.0|I was very shaken when my son told me he was about to be deployed to fight in our war against terrorism, especially after I just finished &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; by Mark Bowden. I told him I don't understand why we have to do this, and why he has to do this. To help me understand why he and all the other wonderful young men and women in our Armed Forces are proud to do what they do, as depicted in &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot;, my son told me I should follow up after &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; and read Norman Thomas Remick's book, &quot;West Point: Character, Leadership,...&quot;. He sent me his copy of it just before he left. I'm still scared for him, but it has helped me to understand America better and come to terms with my fears for my son's life. It's a wonderful corollary to &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot;. I think every American in this day and age should read both books.
B00004TDRD|5.0|Jaws was the best movie I ever saw. The special effects were excellent. The music by John Williams really fit the movie. Richard Dreyfuss was funnier than I expected. The fisherman was a strange one. Cheif Brody was  the hero in the end.
B00004R99U|5.0|I loved this. I rented it from Blockbuster, and i must have watched it at least 20 times (no exaggeration) in 2 1/2 days. it was amazing. And i love john rolf!!!! i fell in love with him. The animation isn't that great though... not AS good. but its really good. and i liked this better than the first pocahontas. well, actually i dont know, i LOVED both of them!!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Brilliantly made movie. Guy Pearce is outstanding. I've never seen a movie made the way this one was. It was a little hard to follow. You have to pay attention through the whole movie. If you miss one part, you may as well start from the beginning. It is well worth the staight attention you have to pay. This is one of those movies where every time you watch it, you discover something you didn't see before. This movie has such a great story to it. I absolutely love the way it was filmed and put together. Kind of a suspensful, who-done-it, sort of movie. Rent it when you have time to get the most out of it and no distractions.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I avoided seeing this one for ages because I assumed from the previews it would be another \\"kids are cool - adults are stupid\\" piece of trash. What was I thinking?<br />Every now and then a movie grabs me, and I watch the DVD literally every day for a couple of months. Contact. L.A. Confidential. 54. That sort of thing. And now, Almost Famous. This movie works on so many levels and rings so absolutely true from start to finish that you don't watch it, you live it. If you were around in the 70's, and you didn't live under a rock, you knew this world, in the same way that a young boy feels he knows the players on his favorite baseball team. I read Creem Magazine all the time. It was like a sacrament. At last, I get to see the other side, the lives of not only the people who wrote those sacred words, but also the people they wrote them about.<br />Although there is plenty of star power here, all the monumentally talented actors are still unknown enough to bring nothing but talent to their roles. There's no star baggage or hype. Even Kate Hudson, the archtypical Hollywood insider, is fresh and new and utterly believable. The exception, of course, is Frances McDormand. As an Oscar winner and three time nominee, she's nobody's unknown, but her gift for loosing herself in memorable roles shines again as the mother of a young Carmeron Crowe-like character angsting over the sudden maturity thrust upon her prodigal son.<br />There are moments; the band on a bus singing \\"Tiny Dancer\\", the guitarist on the roof proclaiming \\"I am a Golden God\\" (once uttered in real life by Robert Plant), and just about every scene with Patrick Fugit, who is nothing short of amazing, where this movie transcends its medium, its message, and becomes something much more. It's a time portal and a crystal ball and a backstage pass all in one. It lets you relive your childhood and fill in the parts that were denied to you the first time around.<br />Don't miss this movie, and don't wait too long beforeyou see it. You've waited far too long already, and in a magic instant it could be the 70's for you all over again, only better.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Turn the lights off, put this movie on and beware of the witches. There are many things to say about this movie, but I guess that the previous reviews pretty much sum everything up. Just buy it and enjoy one of the best horror films ever!
6300216403|4.0|Director Peter Bogdanovich was on a real roll in the early 70s what with \\"The Last Picture Show,\\" \\"What's Up, Doc?\\" and then 1973's \\"Paper Moon,\\" a thoroughly clever, engagingly sharp period comedy adapted from the novel \\"Addie Pray\\" by Joe David Brown. Focusing on a slick, small-scale con artist who finds more than he bargains for after being saddled with a feisty little orphan, \\"Paper Moon\\" may be slightly reminiscent to Shirley Temple's \\"Little Miss Marker\\" by nature, but it's certainly not similar in attitude or style. <br />Ryan O'Neal has never been more ingratiating than as the aptly-named Moses Pray, a sly, charming rogue who resorts to chicanery and flimflammery for survival, targeting little old ladies whose husbands have just passed away. \\"Moze\\" sets up his victims via the obituary notices. His con game consists of engraving bibles with the name of some dearly departed's widow, then showing up at the doorstep of the grievous wife and presenting her with the \\"deluxe\\" version of a bible that her late spouse supposedly \\"ordered\\" just prior to his death, asking, of course, for an outlandish price. Inevitably, the old ladies cave in and pay out, touched by their husbands' significant \\"gesture.\\"<br />Things are running fairly smoothly for Moze until scruffy little Addie Loggins shows up unannounced. Addie, whose mother was just killed in a car accident, claims she has pretty good evidence that Moze, who had an affair with the mother, is her long-lost daddy and now expects to be reimbursed for certain expenses. The angry, flustered Moze denies the paternity accusation but reluctantly agrees to pay her off after his next few scams and drive her across the state line to her nearest unknown relatives...but, that's it! And now the good stuff starts...<br />It's uphill most of the way for this mirthful, beautifully realized entertainment as Moze and little Addie, who becomes an expert partner-in-crime, scam their way through the Kansas heartland. Ryan O'Neal's keen comedy instincts are on all four burners here, but never at the expense of his character or the film's intentions. As he earlier demonstrated in \\"What's Up, Doc?\\", he knows exactly where to draw the line, showing expert skill at `slow burn' comedy, especially in his scenes with the flinty, steadfast little Addie.<br />The surprise, of course, is neophyte Tatum O'Neal, Ryan's real-life daughter, whose first film this was. As the obstinate, worldly, cigarette-smoking waif who could out-curse a sailor, the Oscar-winning Tatum steals practically every scene she's in. A cross between Little Orphan Annie and Wallace Beery, she lights up the screen so naturally and unaffectedly. The casting of both father and daughter is not only inspired but absolutely sublime, possibly the funniest grownup/kid interplay since W.C. Fields and Baby LeRoy. <br />And if that wasn't enough, you have the delectable Madeline Kahn as the frisky, flirtatious Trixie Delight, a carnival cooch dancer who moves in on Addie's territory - that is, Moze - half way through the film. The late, plummy-voiced Kahn, an expert comedy farceur, will keep you rolling in the aisles as she barnstorms her way right into Moze's front seat while disrupting the team's money-making roll, leaving an increasingly peeved Addie no choice but to nip the hotsy-totsy little affair in the bud. Young P.J. Johnson turns in a wonderfully sullen, deadpan perf as Imogene, part of Miss Trixie's \\"entourage.\\" Chief maid and luggage carrier for the unappreciative Miss Trixie, Imogene's disdain for her boss is no secret, comparing her at one point to white specks on chicken droppings. One of the film's highlights is watching Addie and Imogene, in cahoots, cook up and carry out a scheme to split up the adults.<br />The movie loses a bit of steam toward the end with a somewhat less-involving subplot dealing with bootleggers and a corrupt sheriff (John Hillerman), but it's certainly not enough to hurt the genuine appeal of the film. Carefulattention has been paid to the look and feel of this film, which is greatly enhanced by the stunning midwest landscape (shot impressively, like \\"The Last Picture Show\\", in black-and-white), and period-perfect incidentals, which give the film a wonderfully authentic 30s feel.<br />Unfortunately, Bogdanovich's career took an unexpected and momentous nosedive after this film. So, perhaps in retrospect, \\"Paper Moon\\" becomes a wonderful valentine to better days and a loving tribute to a once budding genius.<br />Sheer delight.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is the crowning acheivement of all of Alice in Chains' body of work. As with all of their albums, you can find your self entranced by the harmonies, the deeply troubled lyrics, the grinding whirling riffs, and the steady beat driving its way into your brain like a sledgehammer. Some of this stuff can feel like your heart is being carved out with a spoon, and you will love every minute of it! There is nothing more satisfying to me personally than slipping on the headphones and jamming to this album. With a mixture of Sabbathesque downtuned guitar and the hypnotic vocals of Layne Staley you can find yourself becoming addicted to the sound. I am glad there is no cure! Unfortunatley, no new work is currently pending for this penultimate offering of the Seattle scene. What we, as Alice fans do have to look forward to is the upcoming album Degredation Trip by Jerry Cantrell. The album is due out in June, and from what I have heard so far, it is a more than worthy offering by an amazing musician. It lives up to any thing AIC has done, AND it stands on its own.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|In 1988, a Japanese animated Motion picture called &quot; Akira&quot; has took the world by storm and introducing the world to Anime. It spawned Merchandise, Graphic Novels, Video Games, Pinball Game, Shirts and it even got a limited Theatrical release in the U.S.A getting good reception from the Critics and Audiences alike. It's set in the near future of Tokyo, a Biker named &quot; Tetsuo&quot; gets Injured and is taken to a Hospital where he became a Test subject for a Government Experiment involving E.S.P and wants to find the source of his power. It's a Thrilling, Gory and marvelous Japanese Animated Thriller that will introduce you to Japanese Animation.<br />10/10 ( also check out &quot; Ghost in the Shell.)
B00005OM4N|4.0|When Britney first came into the Pop World she blew everyone away with her talent! This album shows how much she has matured! Some of the songs are really awsome like: Overprotected, Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman, and What it's Like To Be Me. She wrote a lot of the songs on the album. Some songs can make you really depressed like: Cinderella and Let Me Be. But all the other songs are really up-beat and fun to listen to. I think that her first album was better because it was \\"poppier\\" but she is getting older so I guess it's okay that she's going more for the hip hop and r+b sound. I'v loved Britney since she came out and I always will. She has a great voice and she dances really well! If you love music that you can dance to or music just to kick back and listen to, you will love Britney!
B000062TU1|4.0|Unfortunately, many people don't understand the penalties novels converted to screenplay will incur. So many were originally published on paperback, appealed to a wide audience and ended up being a classic, have since seen a producer attempting to do the same justice to it on the big screen.<br />If every scene and every detail were to be reflected onto screenplay, then a movie could extend to many more hours than most would be willing to endure for a children's story.<br />The inverse is also true. A movie originally written for the screen would require additional efforts by writers to convert a script into a novel.<br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a children's classic. The script writers did an excellent job of converting the original classic to something that is manageable, viewable and enjoyable to the wider audience.<br />This is a movie well worth keeping in your video/DVD library and one which is sure to delight kids of all ages, as classics often do.<br />Highly recommended.

B00005QDW5|5.0|I wondered if the world needed another Pink Floyd collection - between the albums, the redigitized albums, the box set, the live albums, what would this do? But I decided to give it a try and was blown away. It is more of the ultimate Pink Floyd concert. Care has been taken to put the tracks in a certain order, and sometimes the flow has been eye-opening. While I own most of the ablums this material comes from, to hear it mixed and matched from many periods of Floyd's work, a great and coherent retrospective emerges. Perfect for putting on and enjoying.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I have seen many reviews, rail on how pointless the ending of this movie was, or even worse they go on about how moving the whole movie was, but how the ending just didn't \\"pay off\\". Here is one persons opinion, and if you don't want the end spoiled for you don't read on. The end of the movie, was utterly perfect, it brought home the whole meaning of what it means to be human. David had been seeking the whole movie to be human, or to be seen as \\"human\\" by the one person he loved, and considered his mother. When she admits to him at the end, before she falls asleep that she does \\"love him\\", it makes his entire journey worthwhile. I too was wondering where the movie was going with the undersea adventure, and the alien post script, but think of the aliens at the end of A.I. as the nicer version of the aliens in \\"Dark City\\". They sought to find out what it means to be human, and they found it in love. How many of us when we love someone wouldn't like to spend a day with them without any of the distractions of the world, and be there complete focus. Anyone who has lost a loved one, or watched someone change dramatically, can relate to the ending of this film, as being memorable. Just because the meaning has to do with love, does not make it sentimental trash, it just shows that our spirit is what makes us human, not our flesh and bones.
0784010501|5.0|i love this movie.  if you are a madonna fan then you need this video/dvd!  this is a must have!  even if you are not a madonna fan, this movie will really get you laughing!  believe me!  its not really a movie, it's just a behind-the-scenes look at the blonde ambition tour.  i give it 2 thumbs way way up.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I think this was a pretty bad idea in the first place, because Pink Floyd was more &quot;album based&quot; than &quot;single based&quot; if you know what I mean. But this is executed pretty well, and gives a novice to the Floyd a good sampling of all their stuff. Too bad they had to edit &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;SOYCD,&quot; though. Oh, well. It still works, and the sound quality's excellent!
6305252572|4.0|Falling into the same genre as 'Beverly Hills Cop', 1982's '48 HRS.' takes the good-cop, bad-crook scene and transforms it to fit Eddie Murphy's talents on a different scale. Instead of chasing high-profile criminals as 'Detective Axel Foley', Murphy portrays a loud-mouth convict teamed up with a hardass detective Jack Cates. Nick Nolte's roll as this chain smoking, trash-talking, loveable sleezbag sort of shadows performances by John Wayne and Clint Eastwood...only in a new age. The low-flash scene is set in California, where Cates (Nolte) loses a battle with two escape conns along with his gun...leaving two more plain-clothed officers dead. The thing I think you need to remember when watching these movies is that the lead cops never dressed in uniform, and you'll see more covertable classic 70s' cars than marked squad cars. Otherwise, Nolte is the perfect grunge policeman who teams up with Reggie Hammond (Murphy) to catch a ruthless killer who Murphy once sided with. From the moment Nolte takes Murphy out of jail for 48 hours, you can sense the racial heat and explosive attitudes of the two. This proved to make for a perfect comedy, as Nolte and Murphy race to kill the killers without killing eachother. Murphy has a classic scene in a highly exaggerated country western bar, where the confederate flag is on every wall and \\"yee-haw!\\" is a common thing to hear. Murphy raises the roof of the bar in a hilarious scene that could only work with this guy. 'Another 48 HRS' 10 years later was a predicted mistake, instead I think the director should've considered remaking the original scene and plot, but using the flash and movie effects not available in 1982. Maybe put a better suit on Nolte or give'em a hotter car...dont use women you would rather see with their clothes ON than off, and make the fight sequences and assaults more realistic. '48 HRS.' still never stops working though, you give a great idea to talented actors and you can make tons of mistakes while still having a great movie. '48 HRS' also features plugs from Annette O'Toole (Law and Order), Sonny Landham ('Lock-Up', 'Predator') and what-ever-happened-to Tara King ('The Avengers'). Dont wait for this movie to be on tv, if you dont hear all the language it doesnt work. Get this movie on DVD while its' still available...but just dont expect to find as great a movie in the sequal.
B00005QIPH|1.0|The above statement has been made by just about every critic who has ever reviewed this album, and it's about as far from the truth as you can get. Tool, Jimmy Eat World, and Radiohead are already doing a lot for the whole mainstream rock scene, and all those fake nu metal bands like Puddle of Mudd don't get much artistic recognition anyway, so who says rock needs to be saved? If you think this is a good CD, you obviously haven't heard any of the underground stuff that's a million times better. Try getting into Far, or Sunny Day Real Estate, or Texas is the Reason.  Check out The Argument by Fugazi. And if you follow up on those suggestions, and still think The Strokes are any good, you need to get your head examined. Honestly...

0192833669|4.0|Upon first glance, Mary Shelleys Frankenstein can be seen as a simple horror story of a brilliant, if not obsessive scientist who in his quest to create life unwittingly unleashes a hideous, seemingly unstoppable monster upon the world.  As the novel progresses, the reader must decide who the real monster of the story is.  Is it the murderous creature, Frankenstein creates?  Or is it Frankenstein himself.  Ultimately, this question leads to a chilling finale amid the frozen arctic in which both characters apparently perish forever.<br />  That would be the impression one would get after just a light reading of the text, but if one were to look much closer at the novel, they may discover many other things about this re-markable piece of Victorian literature.  One of the major themes in Frankenstein seems to be one of rebellion.  Victor Frankenstein rebels against the laws of nature by playing God and creating life.  In turn, his creation also rebels against a society that fears and hates him.  Before this hap-pens, though, the creature must first learn the concept of rebellion.  The creature does this in through books it finds while hiding out in the barn of an old cabin. As the creature carries out its self-education, one book it turns to is Paradise Lost.  Upon reading this, the creature remarks, Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss on my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me (Shelley 105).  The creature takes on many aspects of Satan from Paradise Lost, and can perhaps be called a Satanic Hero because of this.  The creature in this book can be seen as rebelling against a society that fears and hates him.<br />  Other important items, a reader can look for upon reading this novel is an emphasis on extremes, excess and feelings that appears throughout the course of the book.  This emphasis on extremes can be best discerned by Victor Frankensteins decision not to make a mate for the creature.  In regards to this, he states,  for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race (Shelley 138).  Here we see that Frankensteins mindset is one of extremes.  He believes that his work can either save mankind by curing death or destroy mankind completely.  Simi-larly, the landscapes described in Frankenstein are ones of excess.  They are rugged and craggy, extremes of nature.<br />  It would be an understatement to say that this novel has had a great effect on many forms of literature that have followed it.  However, Frankenstein can also be seen as more than a sim-ple horror story.  For some reason, we cannot truly hate the creature despite the numerous acts of depravity it might exact in its quest for vengeance.  No matter how many innocents die by his hands, the creature still appears somewhat sympathetic to us.  Perhaps this is why in the original cut of James Whales film version of Frankenstein he had a scene in which Boris Karloffs creature attempts to rescue a little girl he has thrown into a pond, upon realizing that she cannot swim.  This scene was eventually cut before the film was released, a result no doubt of a society unable to find sympathy in a monster.<br />  That is not the case for the many who have read Shelleys novel though. In the end, the creature may be more human than it is given credit for.  Reaching the end of the book, we are left feeling that perhaps the only thing the creature wanted was to have a mate, and to not be lonely.  That has to be something all human beings long for at least once in their lives.to make a mate for the creature.  In regards to this, he states,  for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race (Shelley 138).

Perhaps this is why in the original cut of James Whales film version of Frankenstein he had a scene in which Boris Karloffs creature attempts to rescue a little girl he has thrown into a pond, upon realizing that she cannot swim.  This scene was eventually cut before the film was released, a result no doubt of a society unable to find sympathy in a monster.  <BR>     That is not the case for the many who have read Shelleys novel though. In the end, the creature may be more human than it is given credit for.  Reaching the end of the book, we are left feeling that perhaps the only thing the creature wanted was to have a mate, and to not be lonely.  That has to be something all human beings long for at least once in their lives.
0452282152|5.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring is a very good book. It show you how much one girl tries to help the family emotionally and financially.<BR>  Griet is a girl who is working as a maid for Johannes Vermeer. He is a painter and has 3 children, and he tries to paint pictures to help keep his family finacially made, but he has problems doing that because he spends such a long time on the paintings that he only gets two to three paintings a year. But once Griet comes along, he gets inspired by her. By using different colored paints and using a different point of view on painting. Johannes Vermeer does not think of Griet as a maid any longer, he uses her as a model and asks her for his opinion on things, but Griet is taking it the wrong way, she is falling in love with him, but she doesn't know what to do with it all. With Johannes bosy and annoying, pregnant wife to his underhanded mother-in-law, Griet is having a hard time full-filling her job helping her master when his wife is not allowed in his studio where he makes his master pieces.<BR>  This book is filled with so many delightful images and you almost feel like you are right there, in the 17th century, in the old Victorian house, and seeing Johannes paint one of his masterpieces. It almost makes you think of how things have changed, but how people did things and how things were. Towns people thought that maids were filthy, underhanded maids who would steal and take things behind there masters back, but Griet was a gentle and caring girl. She did everything that she could to help out her master and try to put in a good name for her family. She makes you want to go back in time and live there, and never come back to reality.

6305907145|2.0|I bought this expecting to see Mansfield Park in the format I had seen it on PBS.  From the very first, it was clear that they had taken license with the book and with the other film version.  Although this film had some interesting film moments, I could hardly recognize the &quot;plot&quot;.  If I hadn't already read the book, I might have enjoyed it more.  If you are a Jane Austen fan, this is not your movie.
0738203335|5.0|As a veteran programmer (on *nix, MS and Mac) I have read many &quot;history of,&quot; &quot;biography of,&quot; &quot;story of&quot; books, and I've enjoyed a lot of them.  However, I can think of none that inspired me as much as this book.  I thought it was very well-researched, incredibly entertaining, and, as I've already mentioned, truly inspiring.  I don't see how any programmer could read this book and not want to go out and immediately develop something new, unique and revolutionary.  For that matter, I don't see how anyone whose just interested in computers and technology could read this book and not want to immediately want to learn how to program.  While I was reading it, I couldn't shut up about how great it was.  Since I finished it, I find myself still thinking about it a lot--and I still can't shut up about it!  I really don't think it matters what your techno-political background is, if you love programming, computers or just technology in general, I think you'll really enjoy this book.
B00005Y228|3.0|Four stars for the front cover (American-watered version), and Three stars for this mixture of Kraftwerk-played Cher and Europop. I'm deeply infatuated with Kylie, and I think she's beautiful, but that's it. No more. This is a great CD cover with a nice soundtrack. For when you wanna go eat junk food.
0060278234|4.0|I liked the book a lot. I strongly recomend you read Sabreil before reading this book. Both are great books. I did not excpect the ending at all. I didn't like the way the author ended it. I guess he had in mind a sequil, that's why I gave it a 4. It was a fast read. If you've read Sabriel then I strongly urge you to read Lireal. Tell Garth Nix that he needs to get going on the sequel to Lirael, not another Seventh Tower Series book! I Highly recomend this book to fantasy lovers.
B00003Q43A|2.0|This movie is a really great movie. I think it would be an easy classic, if not for one problem: Will Smith. If he would not have been in this moive, with all his not-funny jokes and cockiness, thise could have easily been the greatest scifi movie of the 90s. I really love this movie, and might be one of my favorites, if there had been a more serious actor in playing that part.
B00005NWM3|5.0|When I first got Nickelback's CD, I thought that the CD was going to be a bunch of screeching metal guitars and blowing the speakers out with a whole lot of screams... but it's not... the CD reminds me of the Calling, except a little more hard-core.  The lyrics absolutely blew me away... the songs deal with such topics as abuse, abandonment, being superficial, communication, and a bunch of other messages with great music and strong vocals.  The lyrics seriously make you think and analyze what's going on in the world... they make you realize that not everything is hunky-dory.  I can listen to the whole CD straight through, because all of the songs are immensely different and all are unbelievably powerful and get inside your mind.  My favorites are Never Again, Too Bad, Woke Up This Morning, and Good Times Gone.
B000002H2Z|5.0|I was watching r.e.m's story on behind the music.  They were showing some old alternative tv show and they were listing the top five alternative albums of 85.  1. Fables by r.e.m (their best), the rest go like this; one by the talking heads, low-life by new order, the queen is dead by the smiths and this album.  Now in 2002 alternative is alien ant farm, limp bizkit, and linkin park.  Can I go out on a limb and say there has been a precipitous drop in quality as to what is considered alternative music????
B000002GYI|5.0|Simply stated, &quot;Computer World&quot; is Kraftwerk's musical and conceptual masterpiece.  Prophetically portraying a future where human society would be pervaded by and dependant on computers, it is one of the smartest and most cohesive albums ever made.  Released in 1981, it foresaw the advent of the internet age, along with the economic and cultural byproducts that would come because of it.  Kraftwerk were always fascinated by the fusion of man and machine, both in modern life and in the making of music.  &quot;Computer World&quot;, for all it's technological obsession, ends up being a very human record amidst all the machinery.  Unlike modern electronica, which, for the most part, is merely an aural backdrop to the rave culture, Kraftwerk's music is warm and human, despite being wholly produced with electronic instruments.  The song &quot;Computer Love&quot;, which I read to be a sort of precursor to online dating, is permeated with human sadness and loneliness, even as the relentless mechanical beat pulses hypnotically amidst computerized bleeps and squiggles.  The title track, &quot;Computer World&quot;, envisions as future where business and entertainment would be made all the more easy and accessible due to computer networking.  &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; showcases Kraftwerk's humorous side, as well as their almost child-like joy at tinkering with electronics.  The production quality of this album is amazing- sharp and clear, yet retaining the warmth of their analog synths and recording equipment.  Quite simply, &quot;Computer World&quot; is the perfect musical marriage of man and machine.
0064409422|5.0|This fiction book is so delightful and exciting that it should be the only fiction book ever made.  Wonder why  you should read this book?  Well, because if your the person, that I'm sure you are, who has nothing to do every second of his or her life and thinks that a fantasy fariy tale is a very foolish thing even for a four year old.  Now your going to wish you never thought that, 'cause the old hit from the adventures of Narnia is once more entering the new breathtaking realm of fantasy!
B00000IAU3|5.0|No Angel is one of those CDs you play over and over and still hear something different each time. It has a sound of a mature singer who's dealt with her fair share of love interests gone wrong and bumps in the road. Dido, a former member of alternative group Faithless, debuted solo with this CD and it was the best choice of her blossoming career.<br />The tropical sound to most of the songs incorporates a rythmic Carribean feel to the alternative rock that is Dido. Her voice creates an unusual atmosphere, ethereal and fanciful. Dido has a real career ahead of her and I can't wait for the next album!
B000059MPH|5.0|Arguaby the most stylish and sophisticated Christie adaption (not counting the on the mark Murder on the Orient Express, which captures the eerieness and darkness that Dame Christie's novel presented), Death On The Nile provides the grandier and class that any Christie fan searches for when watching one of her movie adaptions.<BR>   Not only does Death on the Nile provide the stars that most Christie adapted movies do, it's glorious costumes,atmospheres, and cinamotography (which, ok, is sometimes amateaur, but it has it's ear popping highs) are all met to the top.<BR>   With wonderfulperformances by Bette Davis, as the irresistable grand dame, who has an impeckable craving for jewelry, Maggie Smith (who has been seen in many other murder mysteries: Gosford Park, Murder By Death, and other Christies too) as the pearl cravers (Davis) nurse (which the two of them trade irresistable little bickers at each other).  But who could forget Angela Lansbarry's hillarious performance as the drunken, bizarre, tangoing romance writer.  Also with wonderful performances by mia Farrow (whoes performance is so scarily psycotic, it's almost not Christie, but hey, she's spectacular) and Peter Ustinov's wonderful, glorious Poitrot, that beats Albert Finney's potrayel by a hair.<BR>    My one (and only ) complaint is for Louis Chiles' ghastly performance as the hated Linnet.  You would think that if they could get Lansbarry, Davis, Farrow, and Smith, they certainly could get someone better then Chiles, and after The Great Gatzby, who would want her.  Her performance is so dull and bored, that you want to jump in and shoot her yourself.<BR>    But, despite Chiles' lazy performance, this is the most stunning adaption of one of Christie's most brilliant and soul captivating novels, that should not be missed by anyone( Agatha Christie Lover or not).
6304118406|1.0|What a foul mess of a film and complete waste of the top-notch actors employed to tell this tiresome yet revolting tale. Cliche-ridden, obscene in the first, second, and third degree, replete with puerile cinematic chicanery, Natural Born Killers is a dazzling failure. Poor Oliver Stone. He created the cinematic equivalency of visiting a tatoo parlour after consuming great quantities of distilled spirits. In other words, a big mistake.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is totally worth it! Every song on here I can relate too! The best song on the whole CD is probley runaway or crawling. These to songs can be played over n over but never get old. Its really the best CD that catches almost everyones ear. This CD is for anyone that likes rock,punk, and a lil touch a metal. If you should buy any CD this is one I recommend!
B00005YU1O|1.0|Let me start by saying that while I did not really like or dislike this movie I gave it such a poor rating for a number of reasons: one I have never seen more people walk out of a movie then I did when i went to see this one (has to say something), two the lead actors voice just really did not sit well with me for the whole movie, three the movie struck me like philosophy 101 and not taught very well.  I did thought think that the animation style was rather interesting; however, I do not think that this movie was the form to be using it in.
B00003CXXP|1.0|For a movie that's almost eight hours long, it sure only felt like it was six and a half hours long. <br />When the sole redeeming quality of your movie is a talking teddy bear, you might want to reconsider things. I'm tired of the Spielberg-buffs saying that this movie is \\"brilliant\\", \\"visionary\\" and that people are \\"missing the point\\". Last time I checked, a movie must HAVE a point in order for me to MISS it. And if you're hoping that John Williams' score will help this movie, think again. It's buried so deep in the mix, you'll hardly ever hear it.<br />Rent \\"Pinocchio\\" instead... you won't want to check yourself into a psych ward after watching it.
0385495323|5.0|If you are contemplating the purchase of this book, buy it!  This is one of the most well written books that I've ever had the pleasure to read.  If you are marginally interested in this topic, Dr. Singh will keep you spellbound. Dr. Singh has a gift for taking a dry, technical subject and bringing it to life.  I would, however, caution those who are looking for in-depth technical descriptions.  That being said, The Code Book provides a wonderful entry level history and technical description of the science of cryptography.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Add Lemmy (from Motorhead), Meatloaf, a train wreck, and a serious amount of speed and you may come close to describing this CD! This album kicks serious tail, non-stop right until the end. When it's over you're trying to catch your breathe. This album is a prerequisite for anyone who wants to have fun. No bull, just straight up Rock and Roll. Let's hope Andrew W.K. is here to stay!
014100018X|3.0|As with Joanne Harris' other books, I really didn't get any sense of \\"France\\" with \\"Chocolat\\" so I was a little disappointed with the setting, but that was okay; fictional places can often be more fun than real ones.<br />The first half of \\"Chocolat\\" seemed light and fun, a fantasy of sorts, with the most delectable descriptions of chocolates thrown in for good measure.  Most of the characters were interesting (though I did feel Armande to be rather shallow), and the dark element of good versus evil was quite enticing.<br />During the second half of the book, however, things just seemed to unravel...piece by piece by piece.  First, Harris introduced new characters (one in particular) and the entire focus of the book seemed to crumble.  The huge battle between good versus evil, which Harris had spent many pages setting up dissolved when the priest (for reasons never made known) simply left the village.  Vienne, the protagonist of \\"Chocolat,\\" did something that seemed so completely out of character, something that seemed to show she wasn't the friend we'd been led to believe she was, that I began to actively dislike her.  Her betrayal of Josephine's trust was quite disappointing.<br />Had \\"Chocolat,\\" in the second half, developed into the book it promised to become in the first half, it would have been both delightful and charming.  The sad fact is, it didn't and I came away from the book puzzled and dissatisfied.  Why didn't Harris continue to develop the charming fantasy she had worked so hard to set up?  When I reached the end of \\"Chocolat\\" I definitely felt I'd finished a different book from the one I'd begun.  And the one I'd finished was the inferior, by far.  I felt this was a shame, since the beginning had been quite delightful.  I do intend on renting the video; I think this may be a case where I'll actually like the movie more.
B00005JLCE|5.0|Okay , before I get started I just wanna say that Madonna is hallarious !!!!! (in a good way) I personally think she is the best actress and best singer & dancer on the whole planet !!!<BR>This movie has to be one of my most favorite Madonna movies next to Desperately Seeking Susan with Rossanna Arquette .  But if you need to watch a movie that makes you feel good , get Who's That Girl? .  That's all I have to say !!!!!!!
B00005JKQX|2.0|Most of us have by now been made aware of the liberties that \\"A Beautiful Mind\\"<BR>takes with the truth (I would call them artistic liberties if the results were actually<BR>artistic), but those of you who haven't are advised to stop reading here.  You're much<BR>better off processing Ron Howard's slick tearjerker in a state of unbiased ignorance --<BR>prepackaged uplift tends to work best when you're unaware of the tinkering.<br />But in light of the hyperbolic swill that DreamWorks (fully Miramax's equal in terms<BR>of dishonest marketing) has decided to stamp on its recent print ads -- \\"There Are Some<BR>Films In Our Lives That Change the Way We Look at the World\\" -- you may leave \\"A<BR>Beautiful Mind\\" wondering what all the fuss is about.  The way you look at the world will<BR>likely remain unchanged, although the level of cynicism with which you regard<BR>mainstream Hollywood most certainly will not.<br />\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" may or may not be the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a brilliant<br />mathematician and game theorist who won the Nobel Prize after a long, difficult struggle<BR>with schizophrenia.  From the beginning, the prodigious Nash is an eccentric, even<BR>reclusive personality, and so it's appropriate that he's played by Russell Crowe, himself<BR>no stranger to ingenuity or surliness.  But the real star here is the radiant Jennifer<BR>Connelly as Nash's long-suffering wife, Alicia; she's easily the most beautiful thing in \\"A<BR>Beautiful Mind,\\" not to mention the only one who shows even a modicum of restraint.<br />Much has been made of Crowe's Academy Award-nominated work, but I'm here to<BR>proclaim that that performance is, as Nash himself might have said, a gross<BR>miscalculation.  Crowe's acting is equal parts physical and intellectual -- he nails every<BR>limp, flinch and mannerism; he delivers every line with a stare that manages to be at once<BR>rapt and glazed-over; he does everything, in fact, but convince you that there's an actual<BR>person underneath all that twitching.<br />The film's inability to make you connect with this blank cipher is certainly not from<BR>want of trying -- indeed, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has swept so much ugly reality<BR>under the carpet that Nash couldn't be more likable if he walked through the entire movie<BR>holding a giant heart-shaped lollipop.  But by pre-exorcising Nash's personal demons,<BR>Howard has essentially ignored the fact that demons, not teary-eyed, pseudo-inspirational<BR>speeches and sappily affirmative dialogue, are what render a human life capable of<BR>redemption to begin with.<br />\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is not without its accidental virtues, but the holes in the story are<BR>apparent even with an untainted viewing.  After the midway revelation of Nash's<BR>condition (which is handled, I'll admit, with spectacular cleverness), the film loses steam<BR>rapidly, and the third act has a languorous, irritatingly meandering rhythm -- you can just<BR>see Howard and Goldsman scrambling to find fresh obstacles for Nash to overcome, so<BR>long as the obstacles don't include divorce, bisexuality or anti-Semitism.  By the time<BR>Crowe is old and wizened enough to deliver a mealy-mouthed (not to mention completely<BR>fabricated) acceptance speech about the importance of love, the film seems to be<BR>humoring rather than saluting him -- what adversity, exactly, has been overcome here? <BR>The challenge of squeezing a complicated and troubled existence into a polished<BR>mental-illness-of-the-week melodrama?<br />Knowing and publicizing the truth about what Howard and Goldsman have<BR>obliterated from Nash's story doesn't stir up problems with the film; it explains them.  It<BR>cuts straight to the center of this callous project, penetrating the shellacked-on layers of<BR>phoniness, exposing the intentions of filmmakers who want to take one of America's<BR>more distinctive success stories and turn it into a generic, traditional one.<br />Certainly it is a dramatist's prerogative (and necessity) to fictionalize reality, and there's<BR>no denying the difficulty of fashioning an entertaining two-hour biopic while retaining<BR>one's integrity, but for Pete's sake, Opie, you could have at least tried.  Goldsman's<BR>screenplay, after dragging us through its revisionist fantasy under the pretense of having<BR>an enlightening destination, finally boils down to \\"a beautiful mind is less important than<BR>a beautiful heart\\" -- and as a message, it's as loathsome and hypocritical as it is<BR>characteristically dopey.  \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" you see, has no heart, beautiful or<BR>otherwise.  And the more you think about it, the uglier it becomes.
B0000634EV|4.0|Down is back again with a new ultra-heavy album. Being the ULTIMATE fan of Pantera and Corrosion of Conformity, I bought this album the day it came out. My first chance to listen to it, however, was today. <br />If you like either COC or Pantera, you should give Down a shot. \\"Beautifully Depressed\\" is almost like Led Zeppelin with an accidental overdose of distortion. \\"Dog Tired\\" is a brutal piece, very predictable. \\"Learn From This Mistake\\" and \\"Lies, I Don't Know What They Are But...\\" are somewhat softer songs, but still heavy in a way, if you read the lyrics.<br />Yet, one draw back I had is the lack of songs. I would have much rather preffered a double-album... It would have been a lot more worth my money. I'd be willing to pay 30 bucks for a double-CD set anytime.
0451527712|3.0|yeah i liked this book.  i read it and it was good
B000002UAX|5.0|The positive reviews need to tone down the hyperbole a little.<br />The negative reviews tend to be more entertaining.<br />One reviewer believes The Beatles were no better than `N Sync.<br />Another complains that the title \\"Bungalow Bill\\" should be \\"Buffalo Bill\\"!<br />I'm surprised that reviewer didn't mention that the cover misspells the word \\"beetles\\".<br />At least no one brought up the tired old argument that since it was a two-record set,<br />it should be called \\"The White Albums\\".
B00005BCPC|4.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie, seeing this movie is what led me to become an 'abashed' Jane Austen follower.  I have seen nearly all of the movies that have been adapted from her writings. And as most know, movies rarely show justice to the original work, so I have ventured into reading the novels for further delight.  The only sad thing is that I come up 'short' handed when looking for works that come even close to Jane Austen's tales.  I should shamingly admit that I have not yet read Mansfield Park, but after seeing such low reviews on the movie, I feel that I must be missing something.
B000063147|5.0|There's no other band out there like Avenged Sevenfold, but there really should be.  A7F blends hardcore/metal/punk and sweet melodic music.  Their first EP \\"Warmness On The Soul\\" is a beautiful ballad with a piano and very soothing guitars.  But don't let that fool you, A7F is heavy ..., and to top it off, their singer Matt Shadows is one of the best singers I've ever heard.  Shadows has a very good singing voice and a good screaming voice, and he uses both frequently throughout the album.  The album's opener \\"To End The Rapture\\" is a short piano intro with some lovely singing by Shadows, it then goes right into \\"Turn The Other Way\\" which starts off with vicious screams and yells but yet has a very melodic and beautiful ending, simply awesome.  \\"We Come Out At Night\\" is the same way on that ending they pull out the piano again end it off with that.  And \\"Streets\\" sounds more like an Offpsring song (not the cheesy offspring).  If you like melodic hardcore, or just hardcore, or just plain good music, check these guys out!
B0000630BT|5.0|After some soft and 'commercial' albums during the 1980's Judas Priest returned in 1990 with Painkiller, in my opinion the best album of their career and arguably one of the best metal albums ever released. The leading instrument on Painkiller are drums. Scott Travis has a powerful and ultra-fast touch to his instrument which is difficult to come by anywhere. Rob Halford's voice is in top condition. Lead riffs by Tipton and Downing are sharp and sound production is crisp. In this album even bassist Ian Hill comes alive a couple of times. Most remarkable and often covered tracks include Painkiller, Night Crawler and Touch of Evil. But don't expect anything from remaster extras.

B000060K4O|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies, unfortunately I can't share it with my family.  They only speak Spanish.  I don't know if the studios realize that soon over half of the film watching public will be spanish speaking.  And these people won't be able to buy or enjoy this type of film.
B00003CXC6|5.0|If you have never seen this film, you will come to it and find it very familiar.  That's because Rashomon has become part of the world's consciousness & lexicon.  It's story of an action involving several participants, each with their own differing version of the truth, has been elaborated and riffed-on by many others since it appeared on the world's stage in the 50's.<br /><br />So, it is an old movie, often imitated.  And yet, I found it fresh and involving and well worth a look.  As Robert Altman says on the DVD extras, many of the camera techniques, particularly shooting directly at the sun and allowing lens flare, were taboo-breaking and radically new when this film appeared.  Now, that is put in as a joke in Shrek.<br /><br />So you come to Rashomon not to be overwhelmed with its \\"newness\\" and the refreshing change of first encountering Japanese cinema and acting styles.  No, you come to Rashomon as to an old master, to appreciate its lasting impression of the universality of human foibles and passions and the illusory nature of truth.<br /><br />A rape and murder have occured in a woods.  We hear and see different versions of the same encounter.  Who is telling the truth?  Is there an absolute objective truth, or does every teller of the tale inherently only tell the truth as he sees it?  And if everyone is a \\"liar\\" and there is no absolute truth, what is the point of anything?<br /><br />Don't let the heavy questions mislead you.  Rashomon moves quickly, fluidly and gracefully, telling its story with economy and, to me, humor.  Much is made of the dark philosophy underneath the theme, but I find great sardonic humor in the film.  One example, the fight between the thief & the man as related by the woodcutter:it is messy and unheroic, sweaty, breathless and awkward and the antithesis of the stylized balletic sword fights found in, even Kurosawa's, samurai movies.<br /><br />In the end, as familiar and much copied as Rashomon has been, it is still like no other film.  It is unique, and the result of a master filmaker's vision, unified and beautiful and unforgettable.
B00004Z459|5.0|i love what linkin park has done with this album. all of the songs are great but my faves would have to be &quot;papercut&quot;, one step closer&quot;, &quot;crawling&quot;, &quot;runaway&quot;, and &quot;in the end&quot;. the rap and rock mixed is awesome to listen to. the more i play it, the more i like it. though i do think &quot;in the end&quot; is over-rated because it is not the best song on the album by any means and it is some what overplayed on the radio. if you like limp bizkit you will love hybrid theory.
0684800713|1.0|Ernest Hemingway is the most overrated writer in American literature. Just because the man lived a romantic life (i.e. he drank a lot) doesn't mean he has to be worshipped by everybody. I hate the way people act like to be of any intellectual capacity you have to like Hemingway. Well guess what? The man can't write! The novel is boring, boring, boring. Nothing ever happens. The characters just go from one meaningless event to the other always speaking in short, little sentences and drinking gallons upon gallons of alcohol.( I'm not kidding here. These characters DRINK. There isn't a scene in this book without some form of alcohol being consumed.) Everyone raves about Hemingway's \\"curt\\" style. Well, it annoys me to no end. I think his style is due more to his limited vocabulary than his innovative ideas. I hated every single one of his characters. They all have the most annoying characteristics you can think a human being could have. They are whiny, spoiled, and lazy. I literally wanted to jump inside the book and trash them all.  I think most people hate this book too but they are afraid that they'll be labeled \\"ignorant\\" if they admit it so they play the part and rave about it. Do not, I repeat, do not read this book. The sooner Papa Hemingway is forgotten the better American literature will be for it.
B000063CPL|1.0|Iron Maiden is not a great sounding live band.  This recording unfortunatly picks up all of the flaws.  The songs from Brave new world sound nearly the same as in the studio.  The only difference are the sloppy guitar solos and tired singing. <BR>  My main complaint is the guitar playing.  Adrian, Dave and Gers have left all thrill for metal in their past!  This is not a live album that guitarists can pick up useful tips, or inspiration.  80% of the solos are so sloppy that they make Chris Holmes of Wasp seem superior.  All the guitar tones are very bassy; giving it a muddy sound; instead of crisp head banging crunch.   <BR>  Bruce really shows his lack of vocal knowledge and technique.  He sounds like a sea pirate with throat cancer.  What happened to the melody and clarity!?  His singing is forced,out of breath and more raspy than usual.  Bruce really needs to retire; before he develops cancerous throat nodules.  It is also obvious that a lot of the intros and choruses were re-sung in the studio.<BR>  Steve Harris sounds good as usual.  He is less audible in the mix than usual live maiden recordings.        <BR>  I am disappointed with this disc.  I thought that with today's awesome technology; the sound would be so wicked sweet.  Anyways,  I would not spend more than $10 on it!  Actually I wouldn't even pick it up; unless Iron Maiden is your entire life.
B000056NX5|4.0|As Lent rolls around every year, I always pull out my well-worn copy of Jesus Christ Superstar on CD.  (I wore out the album, twice).  The music of ALW and Rice is superb and moving.  I've seen the Jewison version of this movie a number of times, and my fiance and myself actually thought that's what we were buying on DVD when we purchased this copy...however.  It didn't take us long to figure out this wasn't the same movie we'd seen before.<br />In terms of the sheer power of the story, this newest entry into the market is head and shoulders above the Jewison rendition.  While I much preferred the way the first JCSS was filmed (on location, etc.) the performances in the Edwards' film were much more powerful.  It pays to remember that when ALW/TR wrote the original score, their goal was to bring Christ to the people of the day.  This staging certainly accomplishes that, even if it's not really my 'style.'<br />Glenn Carter as Christ is tormented by his 'role' as the Messiah, obviously conflicted about his relationship with Judas (more on Pradon later), often poignantly affected by his coming trials.  His voice did seem a bit 'weak' for the material, but it is the scenes of him in the final moments (after his arrest through his cruxifiction) that reduced me to tears.  He lives the pain...it is apparent in every move he makes, every expression on his face.<br />Judas...what can I say.  From the first moment, he captured me.  I've never seen Judas as the cold, calculating man he is frequently portrayed to be.  To me, he was a puppet in the hands of a power he couldn't begin to understand.  He is afraid for Christ and the apostles, that much is made clear.  To him, it's a obviously a case of saving Jesus from himself...but it backfires when he realizes what the Romans really have planned.  Pradon in this role is perfect.  First of all, his voice is stunning.  He sings this role as if it were written for him.  He's just flashy enough without letting it intrude on the story he's telling.  The scene where he realizes what he's set in motion with his kiss is one of the most moving depictions I've ever seen/heard/read of that moment in time.  I'll be looking for more of his work (hopefully in English!)<br />Fred Johanson is amazing as Pilate -- a towering presence with a soul.  The pathos in his voice and face (and body language) as he pleads with Jesus to 'help me help you' made me stop and think about Pilate in a very different way.  Rik Mayall as Herod is perfect.  Herod has frequently seemed 'silly' in other productions.  Mayall's rendition makes him a bored aristocrat with a razor edge of nastiness under the surface.  Not someone I'd want to meet in a dark alley.  Renee Castle as Mary Magdalene is good -- arguably better than Yvonne Ellison as an actress, though I think perhaps Ellison's voice was a little more suited to the music.  That could just be because I've never heard anyone else perform it.<br />This is NOT, repeat NOT, a movie to watch with your children. (Mature teens will do fine, but it's just too intense for the little ones.)  There is some interesting costuming in the scene where Jesus is carrying his cross and the graphic intensity of the beatings/floggings/cruxifiction are very disturbing.  That's part of what made this version more powerful for me.  If you love the music and want to really feel the pathos of the last days, I strongly recommend this.
B00005YW4H|4.0|but I do like Norah Jones :)  Why does everybody place her in the jazz genre - this is not jazz music. certaibly jazz influenced but still clearly not jazz....ok whatever<br />Norah Jones sounds great - cool voice - sounds like herself. she's cute. certainly worth a purchase
B00005QZWI|5.0|With \\"The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" Howard Shore came practically from nowhere to join the likes of John Williams, James Horner, and Hans Zimmer as one of the greatest film composers ever.  When I originally heard that Shore was undertaking the project, my initial thought was that John Williams was the only one who was up to composing the kind of score that would be needed to make the film work.  But, having heard some of Williams' recent lackluster scores such as \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" I think the right decision was definitely made in selecting Howard Shore.<br />The disc begins slowly, softly with \\"The Prophecy,\\" which in the film underscores a narration detailing the history of The One Ring, but even then, the menace is audible.  As a matter of fact, much of the disc is dark and malevolent.  Completing the gorgeously deep and driving orchestrations are splended choral passages almost operatic in style.  Probably the single best section of the disc is the syncopated, chanting mens' choral in \\"The Bridge of Kazhad Dum.\\"<br />The chorals also reveal another high point of the score - its attention to detail.  Unlike John Williams, who wrote the vocals for \\"Duel of the Fates\\" from \\"Star Wars:  The Phantom Menace\\" in  Sanskrit simply because he liked the sound and tone, Shore's vocals have real bearing on and implications in Tolkien's world.  The passages are written in Quenyan and Sindarin (two Elvish languages), Dwarvish, and the Black Speech (the language of Mordor), and say real things, many of which are detailed in the liner notes.<br />In fact, the only English on the disc is in Enya's song \\"May It Be,\\" and this is not only hauntingly beautiful, but very appropriate given the events of the first film.  I think the \\"Evening Star\\" mentioned is in fact Eãrendil's Star, most precious of the Elven stars; its light is in a gift given to Frodo at one point during the movie.  But though it is in English, it does not feel at all unnatural.<br />Then there is the heroic horn cue, as close as the disc comes to a main theme.  It is hopeful and triumphant and expresses the comeraderie of the fellowship, while at the same time giving a sense of the strain they are under.  It is perfect; the only heroic theme that can match it in its perfection comes from \\"Star Wars.\\"<br />The real miracle of this soundtrack, however, is its scale.  From broad and sweeping evil music to the grand and powerful heroism passage, the disc is epic in scale.  However, that does not prevent it from having intimate sections such as \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which make the listner feel comfortable.  The transition from small to big seems almost effortless; it is near perfection.<br />This score is incredibly powerful standing alone.  \\"Lothlorien,\\" which laments the death of one of the film's main characters, is heart-rending.  Some of the dramatic evil music is quite terrifying without anything else to accompany it.  My only regret about this disc is that it features only half of Shore's three-hour score.  No fan of film music, or indeed of orchestral music, should be without it.
B00005JKZQ|4.0|You would not expect Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy to be a great comedy match, but both of them pull if off in SHOWTIME.<br />    De Niro who proved he could do comedy in ANALYZE THIS and BRAZIL proves it a third time.  He does it however playing a \\"De Niro \\" role as the tough no nonsense cop who gets stuck with Murphy to get out of a PR jam.<br />    Like De Niro Murphy plays a part he has played before as the cop who is more savvy about TV then police work.<br />    Rene Russo is fun in a supporting role and William Shatner is absolutely hilarious as himself trying to teach De Niro how to play to the camera.  If he had more scenes he would steal the show.  <br />    The only flaw in my mind was the lack of development in the relationship between Di Niro's character and Russo.  I get the feeling that those scenes were left on the cutting room floor.<br />    Definately worth the price of admission, a great date movie.

B0000508U6|4.0|Remember back in summer 2000 when this cd was starting to fill people minds. Well this is a really good album and I see why it was so popular. This album is really good and all the songs here are good except maybe for one or two track but it is really good. It containes 4 hit singels YELLOW,TROUBLE,DONT PANIC and of course many peoples favourite SHIVER. This album is without a doubt one of the best debut albums ever. I hope their next cd will be as good. Only problem I felt later with this album when it won the grammy for best alternative album. I didnt like it. Not because the album didnt deserve it or anything because it dit deserve it. Its because it was released in 2000 and became a grammy winner in 2002. I also think it should have been nominated for album of the year. Thank You and I hope you will read this review.
B00005Y228|1.0|What is all the fuss about? Vocals are  weak and as far as her videos go she dances so stiff it is laughable. Pop music has become a game of videos with flashing lights and sexy back up dancers and weak singing all aimed at preteens spending their allowances on the flavour of the week. This time next month people will be saying Kylie who?
B00000DFRS|2.0|Whitney Houston is probably the most overated female artist<BR>of all time. Wait did I say artist. Well this woman<BR>has the biggest ego of all time. She does not write her own songs. she does not produce her own work. Well of course there´s <BR>a lot of artist that don´t but she is so critically aclaimed for all the songs that she has sung. Well if there weren´t for <BR>the songs there wouldn´t be any fame. <br />Her vocals, well she has a great voice and great vocals like most people say. But there isn´t anything special about them. Sure she can sing. But. I have heard a lot of girls sing just as well or better than Whitney. There is no energy, softness nor originality.<br />This album is her forth solo album and is her 2nd worst. I have not listened to I´m your baby tonight but i heard it was terrible. <br />This album has lyrics that are the most meaningless. She only sings about love, and love and love and of course love. While you are doing that for 15 years you got to be tired. <br />The songs here aren´t good. If I told you that. Boring, Heartbreak Hotel boring, My Love is your love terrible (I hate Wyclef jean by the way). And all the others and the guests. I don´t get it why Lauren Hill had participation for this album. She is such a good artist. Missy Elliot , she´s probably the biggest mistake in music history. and all the others. <br />We just hope the next Whitney album will be a flop . Because I think it will. I just hope that she finish it before (you know).<br />There is of course songs in between that I like but if you wan´t to buy a good album with qualiy music and great vocals with some originality. Buy TORI AMOS little earthquakes, Sade´s PROMISE , PJ.Harvey´s Is this desire or Björk´s Debut but not this album no way.
B00005QXXO|5.0|we'll take what we can get.  The live version here of &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is spectacular and beautiful, in the vein of Street Spirit.  Totally unexpected.<br />&quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is much stronger on this disc than on Amnesiac.  &quot;True Love Waits&quot; isn't really a &quot;new&quot; song, but this version is better than any you are going to find bootlegged.<br />Definitely worth the money for any Radiohead fan (who doesn't need my help in deciding anyway!)  and for those who haven't ventured into Radiohead territory since OK Computer, this would seem a good place to pick back up.
B000000WF0|4.0|I remember when this album hit stores back in 97. this album<BR>was a smash. I never though listened to it until 5 years later. And I was stunned. This is indeed a great album much better than some Oasis [stuff]. I love all the arranging , the melodies and of course the lyrics. Drugs dont work probably one of the most beautiful songs ever created. A good cd buy it if you can.
B0000024SI|5.0|Whenever my faith start to waiver, one listen confirms that this is the greatest single album I have ever listen to.  The songs still sound fresh with the possible exception of \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" But don't let that stop you this is a must have for anybody who is a music fan.
020530902X|2.0|This short, classic book is essentially a collection of the bits and pieces of advice that Prof. Strunk (and later his student, New Yorker editor E. B. White) considered most important some 50 years ago.  Much of what they say is wise and useful -- as far as it goes.  The problem is that too many people, especially people whose jobs require writing, think that Strunk &amp; White is the alpha and omega of good writing and never bother to learn from better, more thorough, and less dated works.  If you really want to improve your writing, rather than simply salve your conscience, I highly recommend *Style,* by Joseph M. Williams (available in paperback), and *The Reader over Your Shoulder,* by Robert Graves and Alan Hodge (reprinted in 1995 as *The Use and Abuse of the English Language,* yet inexplicably out of print under either title; it's at least as old as Strunk &amp; White but has held up much much better).  If a grammar refresher is what you want, then for my money the best resource is the 60-page section on grammar (including a glossary of grammatical terms) in *Words into Type.*  If you already grasp the basics of grammar and want to deepen your understanding, then Max Morenberg's *Doing Grammar* is an excellent choice.

If I dare to say the only thing that's <BR>wrong is that it. This level like alot of other great anime title's are unattainable and achievable, were as if the animation reaches the level it suffer's in storyline and visa versa , but this is a must have in  your collection if not then your missing a great legacy !!!!!
B000000OU0|5.0|I'm not sure that I can say anything that the other 69 people haven't already said about this 15 song work of art.  Just an unbelievable live album, probably the best live recording ever.  These songs really need no introduction, because they're such well known classics.  'Tequila Sunrise', 'Hotel California', Take It Easy', 'Life In The Fast Lane' and 'Desperado' are 5 superb classics played to absolute perfection.  The 11 live songs on this album sound as good as a studio recording,(they're that great).  'Wasted Time' and 'I Can't Tell You Why' are a couple more of my fav songs on here.  There are 4 newly recorded studio tracks on here: 'Get Over It', which has a cool guitar- intro, and Don Henley ripping it up on vocals. 'Love Will Keep Us Alive' is one of the most beautiful ballads of all time, and a true instant Eagles classic.  'The Girl From Yesterday'(G. Frey) and 'Learn To Be Still'(D. Henley) are both grade-A musical perfection.  I can't recommend this one enough, it is truly enjoyable to listen to time after time.  If you don't have it, you know what to do.  ROCK ON!
B00005OAIE|4.0|Very catching melodies, great songwriting.  Interesting to see all the comparisons to Dave Matthews.  The first time I heard the song \\"No such thing\\", I thought Jude Cole had just released a new album.  His melodies are reminiscent of Jude's early work and he sounds just like him.  Any Jude fan should purchase this.
B000060P79|5.0|The first time i've heard Simple Plan, I fell in love with their song \\"I'm Just A Kid\\". So I decided to buy it. And like the song i've heard the CD was amazing...!!!Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, New Found Glory, Sum 41, American Hi-Fi, Fenix-TX, if you like these band BUY SIMPLE PLAN NOW!!!!All great songs.<BR>The songs that i prefer are \\"I'd Do Anything\\" - \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" - \\"My Alien\\" - \\"God Must Hate Me\\" - \\"One Day\\" - \\"Perfect\\", so like you see I have a lot of favorite songs, and the others are good too.
B000062Y98|5.0|BG's 'A Night at the Opera' is the most ambitious epic kick your face in album I have ever heard!! I must have listened to this album about 25 times in the past 5 days... In my opinion, Dream Theater's 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance' and Blind Guardian's A Night at the Opera are the two MUST HAVE'S of 2002(DT and BG are my personal fave bands). From the opening track--Precious Jeruslam--you know you are in for the ride of your life... Every single song is just as catchy as the next, you will find yourself singing along after the 2nd or 3rd listen to this album. Those of you that were hoping for something heavier and crunchier then Nightfall on Middle Earth, look no further then ANATO--- your mind will be boogled at the layers of shreds, phenominal unearthy guitar solos, double kick drum beats, and epic story writing. There is a reason why no band can even hold a candle to Blind Guardian...I've searched and searched.. I must have heard every epic symphonic power thrash metal out there.. NO ONE WILL EVER TOP THE MIGHTY BLIND GUARDIAN!! And a Night at the Opera proves it all!! Blind Guardian will joust any other band you will ever have known... JUST BUY THIS ALBUM...and then buy BG's Imaginations From the Other Side!!
0790720434|5.0|This is the best version of the secret garden i have ever seen!I love EVERYTHING about it.The story, the acting , the settings , everything! I especially LOVE Kate maberly's , heydon prowse's, and andrew knott's acting. The three of them playing the role of the three children , mary lennox,colin craven,and dickon sowerby,<BR>gives you a perfect idea of how the characters are.This is the very best version of The secret garden , ever!

B00005ARDC|5.0|Many have been comparing BRMC's debut to The Strokes.  However, their music isn't that similar at all.  Think of BRMC as The Strokes on a very very bad day.  This debut is dark and sad, and the mystifying sound of their roaring guitars shrouds their songs in a cloak of misery.  They set the tone with the first track, &quot;Love Burns,&quot; and continue their sad energy throughout the entire album.  Even some misleadingly uplifting songs (&quot;Whatever Happened to My Rock 'n' Roll (Punk Song),&quot; for example) are bathed in sadness.<br />Despite the sadness, BRMC manage to maintain an energy that is similar to the Strokes' music.  (The Strokes, however, have a much easier time, as their music is much more uplifting and joyous.)  Their cloudy sound (excessive guitars and laid back vocals) provide a hauntingly peaceful turn on songs like &quot;Too Real&quot; or &quot;Head up High.&quot;  The one saving grace from all the misery on BRMC's debut is &quot;Spread Your Love,&quot; with the delightful chorus, &quot;Spread your love like a feeling, don't you ever come down...&quot;<br />BRMC's lyrics, consumed with love and life, are poignant, and only add to the darkness of the album.  They are heartfelt and go straight to your soul, even in the most chaotic songs.  Their vocals, sometimes passive and relaxing, sometimes panicked and disheveled, carry the message of their songs.  Throughout the album, BRMC question the validity of love, the reality of life, and the importance of religion.<br />This album is emotionally tumultuous, and it's all the better because of it.  Overall, BRMC's debut is startlingly powerful for seemingly easy-going rock 'n' roll.  Can't wait for the next one.
6302969352|5.0|A long and brilliant movie, &quot;The seven samurai&quot; is the best example of an odd genre: japanese movies based on american westerns, long before the &quot;spaguetti western&quot;!. But this movie it's much more than a action movie about good samurai against bad people, it's a movie about social problems and class contradictions: a group of jobless and hungry samurai (certainly a middle class in shogun's Japan) are comitted to defend a small peasant's village, from the inminent attack of bandits, in exchange of meager meals; it's very interesting to see all peculiarities of such complex relationship, evolving to a situation were only one group will claim victory.<BR>Besides it's a movie with direction, Akira Kurosawa bringing home such a brilliant story without &quot;holes&quot;; with actors, Toshiro Mifune, one of many in the movie, in one of his best roles, as a &quot;truly&quot; samurai; with scenes, the rural Japan; and sounds, the upcoming bandit's horses raiding into the village.<BR>Buy this movie, without a doubt, and you'll have more than a classic, you'll have a good and entertaining movie.

B00005Y228|5.0|'Fever' is an extraordinary mixture of 80's pop, 90's techno and the new century's sound which shows how great Kylie is as an artist and how good her voice actually is....Kylie is the second biggest female artist in the world after Madonna... She is huge everywhere in the world...In the UK she has had 22 top 10 hits... and in Europe she is absoulutely big...In my country Lebanon, 'In your eyes' was her 12th number 1 hit....<BR>In the States, she is still known as the one hit wonder from the 80's, but all that is about to change soon with the release of her great funky album 'Fever'...With tracks such as the first hit single 'Can't get you out of my head' or the second hit 'In your eyes' which is in my opinion, the best track on the album, she definitly can't go wrong...Also, other tracks on the album are potential hits, such as 'More More More' which is an up-tempo up-lifting camp song that can make you groove, also 'Love affair' is a beautiful techno feel-good track which is one of the many highlights of the album....'Fever' is a must have...It is just a  work of pure music genius....Although 'Light Years' was in my opinion a far better album...especially with hits such as 'Spinning around', 'On a night like this' and 'Your disco needs you'....<BR>LOVE IT OR HATE IT...KYLIE RULES THE WORLD....
B000000ZKD|5.0|The greatest band in America took on the greatest band in England, and the boys from Memphis held their own. This is a very cutting edge and ahead of its time (Think Pink Floyd, Metallica) album. The Beatles and The MGs' influence and superiority on and over the future of music is clearly evident here. Some may not consider it an essential MGs album, because by covering Abbey Road, it doesn't feature original material. However, hearing the Stax Records house band burn through these great compositions is an amazing experience. Al Jackson does things that the wonderful Ringo Starr could never imagine. Duck Dunn does the Paul McCartney thing better than Paul McCartney. And Steve Cropper never even heard Abbey Road! Booker T. Jones taught him what to play! Another testament to these two men's greatness. How could you do The Beatles without lyrics? Only one band could. When the MGs got their hands on anything, including the material here, one quickly forgets and doesn't need anything but the music. The whole band is in peak form. They bring their Stax soul/funk to the table and also, show themselves as world class musicians as on their both beautiful and barn storming cover of \\"Something\\". And In The End, McLemore Avenue equals or argueably betters Abbey Road.
B00003CXI0|3.0|To Michael Gebert-Yes, the movie certainly did not live up to my expectations, but was it really necessary to blame America? There have existed a plethora of GREAT American movies, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone not being one of them.  If anything, blame the director for forgetting the magic of the story.<BR>Ok, anyway, the movie, first time around, was quite disappointing, perhaps because I was busy noticing all the details left out.  But hey, that is what happens with all movie adaptations of books.  It was nice, but seemed very choppy and...lacking, despite its length.  There was no sense of anticipation or involvement.  The movie didn't sweep me away, and it seems that anything having to do with Harry Potter should.  I had major problems with the casting; I was fuming the duration of the movie about how the Weasley twins were NOT the Weasley twins, Ron was...ICK, Hermione's hair was not nearly bushy enough, Draco's eyes were supposed to be grey, and the actor was obviously too cute and pinchable to play that role.  But otherwise, it wasn't bad.  :o)
0385503954|5.0|The first 50 pages or so of this excellent novel move at a snail's pace, but this is readily forgotten (and forgiven) by the end.  McEwan just keeps getting better and better.  Captures the flavor of England at various times and in various places (country house, hospital, with the BEF in France at Dunkirk).  One of the best books of the year.  Fluently written, excellent characterization and dialogue, explores larger themes without pontificating about them.
B00005JKED|2.0|what a stupid movie. Hawke can't act, Denzel does his best A-hole, and all with a plot that any rookie cop could shoot holes though.I meen COME ON if hawke didn't know know that he was being set up in the first five minutes he deserves to get busted.it sure show's the poor taste of the oscars that they gave Denzel an award for his worst preformance yet.
