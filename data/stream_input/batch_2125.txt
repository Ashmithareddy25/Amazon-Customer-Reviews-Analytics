B002LFPAUC|5.0|It's Fawlty Towers or Watery Towels or a number of other things :) It's a great addition to anyone's collection of humor, not just British humor. It is a must see, even after all these years, wish there were more than 12 episodes?

B005IQZB14|5.0|If you're one for self discovery, you'll definitely enjoy this book.  Her journey is moving and her words are heartfelt, touching and humorous.  I definitely recommend this book!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I am 58 and had never owned a Leonard Cohen album until this one, which enthralled me from the first when I happened to hear it on SiriusXM several months ago. Simply put, this is a spiritual and melodic masterpiece; gospel music at its best. Cohen's voice IMO has never been better, and the female background vocalists are exquisite. The lyrics are rich and mysterious, very close to pure poetry. I'm not a religious person but this music puts me into church every time, in the best way possible. Seriously hypnotic and joyous music, this CD has not left my player in over six months.

B004U52VPS|5.0|I know how cool the game on the phone is and thought this would be a great gift for my nephews and boy was it.  They play this game all the time and keeps them entertained for hours...I think they play this more than the one on the tablet.  I have played it with them and have to admit it is just as fun as well...Made a great gift
B002XWTKC2|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I love watching it over and over. Eddie Murphy is absolutely hysterical and Nick Nolte is the polar opposite in his role
B0073XM77G|5.0|I love this movie. It's short enough for kids to enjoy over and over and the only speaking is in the beginning. The music brings memories of childhood back to me, and hopefully creates some for my children. The ideas that they present about what you would do with your snowman if he came to life are very fun.

1451695187|5.0|This book reinforces God's promise of the hereafter...a beautifully written account by a person who actually went through the dying process and the trip to Heaven.  A miracle occurred, and you have to read the book to see what happened!<br /><br />Some of the author's musings related to his neurosurgeon's knowledge were a little deep for me, but did not take away from the premise.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this to believers and non-believers alike.

B000BMYWYC|5.0|I broke a piece on a Gundam model I was building. I don't have the time, equipment, or skill to paint the models, so I wouldn't be able to cover up the damage that well, I just wanted to repair the piece, so I could finish the build. This cement worked so perfectly, you can't even tell the piece was broken.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The original should be read by all; better than the musical versions.<br />This is a great story. The novel stands well on it's own as a work of art.
B004AFFZNI|4.0|If you have a GoPro, and you want to be able to do certain things with it while it is recording,this case is a must-have. For example, I took a long time lapse of hurricane Sandy out my window by using the case. I was able to run the GoPro without a battery, and just had the GoPro constantly plugged in via USB. Also, I can connect the GoPro to a display using an HDMI cable while it is recording because of this skeleton housing. If you want to do those sorts of things, get this even though it costs too much. Otherwise, skip it.
B0045Z6JAQ|5.0|Totally loved it! Cant believe we never saw it til now!! Science fictions are one of our favorites. Thank You!
1616614609|5.0|This is the hot game right now. This is the first game in a long time where I have gotten into a semi-competitive scene. If you want to play a CCG, but don't want to have to wastemoney collecting cards from random boosters, LCGs are the way to go. This is definitely the #1 LCG around, so play it while it's still popular.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I watched this with my 16 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it!  Funny, sweet, good music and it has a good heart.  It didn't &#34;sell out&#34; but stayed true to the characters.  Fun musical numbers!
B00338QENI|3.0|While the subject matter of this book is very interesting (the culturing of this woman's cervical cells which have since then been used in medical research around the world), the author goes into too much detail in some ways.  It is difficult to keep the cast of numerous family members and physicians/researshers straight, especially because the story is not told in a linear manner.  One of the strengths of the book, however, is the respect with which the author treats everyone in the story.
B00571F26Y|5.0|It's documented but not boring!  Knowledge is power and this book is helping me understand years of frustration!  More than that, losing the wheat is way easier than I would have thought it would be once I decided to do it.  It's a life change that works!
B008RTE09S|4.0|So how do you follow up an album like \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" (no pressure, right?).  There are a goodly number of otherwise diehard Beatle fans who would prefer to pretend that \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" (the 1967 film, not the album) never happened. But it did. Right after Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play. And try as we might, we can't change history. Now, for all you youngsters in the audience this evening, MMT was originally presented as a holiday special on BBC-TV in December of 1967. According to a majority of critics (and puzzled Beatles fans), the Fabs were ringing out the old year on a somewhat sour note with this self-produced project. By the conventions of television fare at the time, the 53-minute film was judged as a self-indulgent and pointlessly obtuse affair; a real psychedelic train wreck. Added up over the years, it's probably weathered more continuous drubbing than \\"Ishtar\\" and \\"Heaven's Gate\\" combined.<br /><br />However, despite the fact that this tragical history lore has become the meme, this newly restored Blu-ray release begs a critical reappraisal (after all, it's been 45 years). Granted, it remains unencumbered by anything resembling a \\"plot\\", but in certain respects, it has actually held up remarkably well. Borrowing a page (one assumes) from the Merry Pranksters, the Beatles came up with a simple premise. They would gather up a group of friends (actors and non actors alike), load them all on a bus, and take them on a \\"mystery tour\\" across the English countryside. Everybody was encouraged to improvise around the, erm, \\"script\\" that did exist (sort of). They would just film whatever happened, then sort it all out in the editing suite. The resulting footage provided transitional padding between the (slightly) more choreographed music numbers.<br /><br />It's the musical sequences that benefit the most from the audio/video cleanup; those washed out VHS prints with horrendous sound quality that have been floating around for years certainly did no favors for the film's already tarnished reputation. The luxury of hindsight reveals that several (particularly \\"Blue Jay Way\\", \\"Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"I Am the Walrus\\") vibe like harbingers of MTV, which was still well over a decade away. Some of the interstitial vignettes uncannily anticipate Monty Python's idiosyncratic comic sensibilities; not a stretch when you consider that George Harrison's future production company HandMade Films was formed to help finance \\"Life of Brian\\". As for the film's episodic approach and surrealist touches, it falls right in line with some of the work being done at the time by art house darlings like Fellini and Godard. That being said, MMT is far from what I'd call a work of art, but when taken for what it is (a long-form music video and colorful time capsule of 60s pop culture)-it's lots of fun. Roll up!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Unable to put it down and excited to start the second book .  You won't be disappointed.  Action from the beginning.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm sure you've heard the old chestnut about cockroaches and Cher surviving the Apocalypse? As the James Bond movie franchise celebrates its 50th year with the release of \\"Skyfall\\", you might as well add \\"007\\" to that short list of indestructible life forms. It might surprise you to learn that not only is the franchise still very much alive and well, but that I would rank \\"Skyfall\\" amongst the very best in the series. Helmed with great intelligence and verve by American Beauty director Sam Mendes, this tough, spare and relatively gadget-free Bond caper harkens back to the gritty, straightforward approach of \\"From Russia with Love\\" (the best of the early films). Interestingly, the film's narrative owes more to Howard Hawks than it does to Ian Fleming; I gleaned a healthy infusion of \\"Rio Bravo\\" in Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan's screenplay.<br /><br />In this outing, Bond (Daniel Craig) has gone into self-imposed exile and crawled inside of a bottle (not unlike Dean Martin's drunken and dispirited lawman in Hawks' film) after uncharacteristically blowing a mission and suffering a near-death experience. However, when a diabolical cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem) with a very personal grudge against M (Dame Judi Dench) begins wreaking havoc directly on the MI6 HQ, the presumed-dead and barely fit for duty 007 reluctantly comes out of hiding to offer his help. Still, M doesn't exactly greet the prodigal son with open arms; he must first prove that he can get his mojo back (the subtext of rebirth serves as a device for rebooting the mythology of a couple significant franchise characters, including a passing of the torch).<br /><br />Craig has finally settled comfortably into the character; his Bond feels a little more \\"lived in\\" than in the previous two installments, where I felt he was a little stiff and unsure about where he should be at times. Most notably, I was glad to see one element return to 007's personality: a mordant sense of humor. Bardem is a great Bond villain; his characterization mixes the cool intelligence and creepy charm of Hannibal Lecter with the nihilism and disconcerting cruelty of The Joker (topped off with a blonde fright wig). Ralph Fiennes is in fine form as a government overseer, and it's always a treat to have the great Albert Finney on board. Naiome Harris is excellent as a fellow MI6 agent. This is one of the most beautifully photographed Bond films in recent memory, thanks to DP Roger Deakins (one particularly memorable fight scene, staged in a darkened high rise suite and silhouetted against the backdrop of Shanghai's neon nightscape, approaches high art). I think the Bond geeks will be pleased; and anyone up for pure popcorn escapism will not be disappointed. Any way you look at it, this is a terrific entertainment.

B008GFI3QE|4.0|While no one can deny the inherent musical genius of the Beatles, it's worth speculating whether it would have reached the same dizzying heights of creativity and artistic growth (and over the same 7-year period) had the lads never crossed paths with Sir George Martin. It's a testament to the unique symbiosis between the Fabs and their gifted producer that one can't think of one without also thinking of the other. Yet there is still much more to Martin than his celebrated association with John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br /><br />Martin is profiled in this engaging and beautifully crafted 2011 BBC documentary. The film traces his career from the early 50s to present day. His early days at EMI are particularly fascinating; a generous portion of the film focuses on his work there producing classical and comedy recordings (including priceless footage of Peter Sellers from his Goon Show days). Disparate as Martin's early work appears to be from the rock'n'roll milieu, I think it prepped him for his future collaboration with the Fabs, on a personal and professional level. His experience with comedians likely helped the relatively reserved producer acclimate to the Beatles' irreverent sense of humor, and Martin's classical training and gift for arrangement certainly helped to guide their creativity to a higher level of sophistication.<br /><br />The film is a bit of a family affair as well. You get a good sense of the close and loving relationship Martin has with his wife Judy (who he met while working for EMI) and son Giles (who is following in his dad's footsteps; they collaborated on the remixes of Beatle songs for the LOVE soundtrack album). At 81, Martin is still spry, full of great anecdotes and a class act all the way. He provides some very candid moments; there is visible emotion from the usually unflappable Martin when he admits how deeply hurt and betrayed he felt when John Lennon rather curtly informed him at the 11th hour that his \\"services would not be needed\\"for the Let it Be sessions (the band went with the mercurial Phil Spector, who famously overproduced the album). Insightful interviews with artists who have worked with Martin (and admiring peers) round things off nicely.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|If there were several days between readings, I found it hard to keep up with bouncing back and forth between generations, and remembering who was who.  However, story line and plot were intriguing, characters well defined.

B00A18KCSQ|5.0|foals, no band out there quite like them. i haven't even received my cd yet, (it was shipped today on schedule) but i wanted to write a review. all three of foals' albums are great in their own unique way. from what i've heard so far from HOLY FIRE, i'd have to say it's an instant hit in my, and i'm sure a lot of other foals' fan's books. MY NUMBER is the first track i fell for. as i compose this, i'm listening to the closing track titled MOON. brilliant. enchanting. this song makes me sit back and stare into space, and know. i can say that this cd will not depart from my car's cd player for at least two weeks. another gem for the soundtrack to my life. stoked....
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great game with lots of characters! Recommended! It has a DOTA feel to it and uses strategy and caution. Very fun.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Awesome in every sense of the word. You can tell Weir has really done his research when writing this book and taken his time, particularly explaining some of the more complex chemistry and physics concepts. Gripping from the first few pages- i was hooked. I hope they make a movie out of this. Castaway on mars!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I can't wait for the next book to come out! Engaging to the last page, I enjoy the Puller series. Keep them coming!
B005TQAI6G|1.0|I would have given this a zero rating if possible! This DVD is a complete and total utter piece of garbage! The choreography is off key and bad. She is very stiff and barely dancing other than a few poorly coordinated movements and the WORST OF ALL...she is LIP SYNCING!!!! This is totally unacceptable! I understand that Brit is one of those studio artists but I would have preferred to hear her voice a little unsteady or poorly controlled than the studio track over crappy choreography! I'm disappointed because I love Brit and her music since &#34;Bay One More Time&#34; and her comeback from the bipolar breakdown was commendable but this is not her standard whatsoever. I'll still buy her cd's because her music is very upbeat simple dancey pop. No ballads or deep moving music. Just fun upbeat dance clubbing with friends. The DVD was painful to watch. I couldn't even make it through the first set. I will be demanding my refund as well as all of us who wasted $15. It would be great if we could all file a class action lawsuit to demand a ban on the sale of this fraudulent p.o.s.

B0000035E7|3.0|In my opinion, a striking feature about Nirvana is that all their albums (excluding Incesticide) have one unique tone. In Bleach, their 1989 debut record that tone is clearly anger. It's not hard to see why; according to reports Kurt Cobain wrote most of the lyrics after a particularly bad break-up when he was in his own words \\"pissed off\\". While anger and frustration in regard to love can produce amazing music (Fleetwood Mac's Rumours being the best example), in the case of Cobain and early Nirvana, it did not. It's not that the record itself is bad; it's just so bleak to the point of alienating audiences. I must be honest: this is my least favorite Nirvana album. There are without a doubt some great songs on this album, such as Blew, School and the underrated About a Girl (the albums only \\"happy\\" song). But the rest of the music is hardcore punk, and while this was perhaps Nirvana at it's rawest and most honest it is not particularly pleasing to listen to. As mentioned, it is completely alienating to a non-heavy metal or hardcore punk fan. Ironically that sense of alienation was exploited on their final and best release In Utero. However, that record benefited from much better music and far superior lyrics. On Bleach, the alienation a non-hardcore punk fan will experience is unable to be overlooked like on In Utero. While it's not a terrible record, it's not a particularly good one. It IS essential for devoted fans to own, so they can observe the band at it's pre-Nevermind phase, when they were not well known, but for the casual listener, if there is one Nirvana album to skip, it's this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome! I LOVE IT so much that its to die for!I would tell every one about my discovery!
B000003TA4|5.0|Before this record, alternative rock and punk was just that: Alternative. It was only followed by a small audience, and received little respect or recognition from critics of the day. In the world before Nevermind, Michael Jackson still ruled the charts and hair and arena rock was still a very relevant movement in music. Enter Nirvana, circa 1991. The radios began blaring a song that sounded like no other at the time: Smells Like Teen Spirit. While Nirvana's recording company did not expect the song to amount to anything, it quickly became a hit. People quickly realized that the album the song appeared on was filled with similar hits, such as Come as You Are and In Bloom. The album shot to number one on the Billboard charts and became the best selling record of the 1991. Nirvana shot to fame, alternative rock become mainstream. History was made in the music industry, and paved the way for bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden to become popular.<br /><br />That's the historical value of the record. Does it still hold up over twenty years later? Yes, and while it's impact will probably not be as hard as it was to 90s teens, it remains a crowning achievement in 90s music. The popular hits off the record are still just as powerful as they were in 1991. The lesser known tracks are still just as good, in some cases perhaps better. Songs like Drain You and Lithium are striking in their preposterous but effective blend of happy pop melodies with decidedly unhappy lyrics. Smells Like Teen Spirit has perhaps lost most of it's initial impact from overplay, but remains a masterwork of punk guitar and nonsense lyrics. Polly, with its disturbing tale of a kidnapper/torturer is one of the bleaker songs on the album, but its clever guitar licks do much to dull it's bleakness and make it a readily accessible song. A similar vein is found in Territorial Pissings and Breed, which would probably be terrible songs if not for the insane energy found in the music behind them. But perhaps no song is as haunting or effective as the closing track Something in the Way. The tale of Kurt's fictional residence under a bridge is one of his most frank and honest songs, and unfortunately was indicative of the inner turmoil that led to his demise.<br /><br />While perhaps the record has lost it's \\"life-changing\\" elements due to the passage of time and growing familiarity with it's songs, it still remains a masterpiece of 90s music and is one of the most fun and perfect records ever made.
0062082353|4.0|I orgionally purchased this for my husband for Christmas. After Chris's ironic, untimely death a few weeks ago, I felt the urge to read it.  I am by no means an expert in all things military..  I really enjoyed reading this book.  Maybe enjoy is the wrong word to use but I dont know what else to say. It was in his own words, his experiences, his struggles.  I think that his wife's contributions to the book made it even more real for me.  Some parts made me laugh, some made me cry and while I will admit some parts explaining what weapons he used and why went way over my head I appreciated them all..  I would read this again and most likely will.  When my 8 year old son is old enough to read this I will have him do so.  It made me appreciate even more the struggles and sacrifices our soldiers have to fight to keep us safe.  Rest in peace Chris and I pray for your wife Taya, and your children and your family and friends.  I would recommend this for anyone to read, military or not, man or woman.. It really puts life into perspective.
B001NLJ33K|3.0|this movie was not related to the old Miami Vice in any way.. they should have changed all the name and ran as new cops..not use the original names of sunny and tubbs..because they did the original characters no justice at all..

B005H29GSI|4.0|We all love Angry Birds! This game takes it into real interaction with the challenges, rather than just on the screen.  Plastic pieces to stack, and knock down, upsetting pigs.  Obviously, much different level of skill than pulling back a catapult on a screen, so a different learning experience.  Plus, more than one player can attempt to dislodge the structure, whereas, it is impossible to wrestle a screen away from someone who needs \\"just one more try\\".  The only drawback is that we really miss the sound effects!!  We will have fun playing this with our grandchildren.

I really felt for Sky, Holder and Karen. What they had to endure and to survive is amazing. The characters had strength and so much love. I know this review is vague but I don't want to give too much away. Hopeless is a great read and I've recommended to friends & family.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|I had this on my android phone, while the gyro controls didn't work hardly at all on the kindle, (they worked ok on my LG Thrive), This game is still fun to play using the 'joystick' method.

I just bought it for my PC and I'm still trying to figure out how to fly and shoot and what not, on the table the experience is so much more simplified.  I have played this game everyday since I purchased it and I took it off and reinstalled it just to do the campaign again.  I love that I can unlock planes after earning keys after earning enough points per plane to get to the next stage.  I'm aiming for the top spot.  This game is great!  The graphics are spot on for the Kindle HD, If you're into the flight sims you'll love this.  It's a no brainer.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Never read the book - and one of my step-children was reading it in school. Watched it with them - and was glad to finally learn what To Kill A Mockingbird was all about. Nothing like I thought. Just a good oldie timey story. Gregory Peck was great!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm a guy, and I don't usually like these kinds of books, but I have no shame in saying I loved this book, it will always be apart of me and I cried at some parts. This book was fantastic and I highly recommend it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|While this movie was hard to watch, I felt it truly told the story of what alcoholism can do to a persons life and how it affects others around them. I noticed it was only getting 3 star ratings from others and I found that rather sad. Having experienced the horrible effects myself, I appreciate the honesty of this movie. Bravo!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is an amazing book that I absolutely loved. I would defiantly recommend reading. This is my favorite book (and trust me I've read a lot of books.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|At the beginning I thought it would be like the movie with JuliaRoberts. But then, as usual, Mr.Sparks surprised me with an excellent story, twists and turns that I would have never expected to happen. Hope the movie is as good as the book was!
B0063GORYU|4.0|It has lots of options for the ultimate game of spider solitare n its free! Just wished it combined all types of solitare.
B0030DIP7O|4.0|Although the CDs are housed in basic cardboard sleeves. it's great to have all the music together in one collection. yet liner notes would have been a plus... All in all though I'm really happy with the sound quality and the variety of musical material. being a long time Scorpions fan it was nice to be able to get the tunes at an affordable price.
1568363931|5.0|This is a great books with lots of recipes. What I love best about it is that the author has taken into consideration American Bento lovers and has formulated recipes for ingredients found outside of Japan. She includes traditional Japanese cuisine as well as recipes from other countries. The ingredient lists include substitutes for some items that may be hard to find. The recipes are portioned for the bento boxes and the author also gives suggestions for things you can make ahead of time and freeze for later use (like rice). A great beginner bento book for sure!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Although I have seen all the Nicholas Sparks movies, I hadn't yet read any of his books.  I was drawn to this one and am so very glad I read it.  It was a beautiful story of love, loss and pain for Alex, his kids and Katie.  It grabbed me immediately and the story was engaging, literally,  till the very last page.  Romantic and heartfelt and rewarding ending.....
0425264351|1.0|\\"Killing Floor\\" should be an inspiration to any aspiring writer. If this book could get published (and sell), anything can.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|this is a quality watch and great value at that.  i needed a watch for nursing school and im definitely happy with the purchase.  i would absolutely recommend this watch to anyone considering purchasing it.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I always wanted to read Treasure Island.  An easy read with great visuals.  As a side, it definitely helped me with my nautical terms for my boating and I'm ready for \\"Talk like a pirate day\\" this year!<br /><br />Great fun
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Not especially long, but enjoyable nonetheless. Not too hard but not so easy it was boring. Some of the sound in the cut scenes seemed a bit blotchy or not quite right, but didn't affect gameplay too much.
0425252868|5.0|This is one of those books that everyone should read, even those (like me) who are not typically interested in reading about history or WWII.  The story of these two brave men and their fellow airmen touched my life.  I believe all high school students should be required to read this book - to see that staying true to yourself and not following the expected norm of violence is the higher call!
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Been a while since I watched LoA but now I have the full pack, DVD, booklet and 35mm frame souvenir. Perfect.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love Jack Reacher. As always he keeps me awake until I finished his book. Lee Child really knows how to keep the pages turning.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I liked the book, although it was written a long time ago and some of the phrasings are tough to translate back into modern days. All in all a great story about a very adventurous boy, and I would recommend it to anyone around 13 years of age or older!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I felt this was a decent action movie, which was all I was looking for when I rented it.  The plot is interesting and fairly unique, but the ending was kind of predictable.  There were some holes in the plot, but part of watching a movie is suspending your beliefs and just enjoying the show.<br /><br />The acting was good and I felt it was well cast.  I would recommend this movie to action/thriller movie lovers who are looking to be casually entertained - not those looking to be blown away or amazed by &#34;genre defining film.&#34;
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This man made it very convincing that there is truly a heaven. It should strenthen your faith on everlasting life after death.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I read several reviews that suggested this movie did not fit the &#34;Bourne Formula.&#34;  While it is a continuation/character-reboot that does not tie in with the other films in a seamless fashion, it does lie securely in the vein of the Bourne action film series.<br /><br />I fel the movie was cast and acted well.  Some reviewers have commented on some plot holes and storyline ambiguity, but I feel all of the films have similar issues (with or without writer/director intention is speculative).<br /><br />I was entertained and thought the movie met its objective of providing an entertaining action film true to the Bourne series - while amping up the seriousness characters and action sequences (similar to the recent James Bond reboot series) from the previous films.  The storyline is a bit more of a &#34;realistic&#34; stretch with the genetic alteration element, however, it did not spin the movie off into the Sci-Fi genre.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really liked the app and would like more like it<br />Gives more information than I really need but is good fun anyway

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Depraved  view of humanity strewn freely about.  Cleverly hidden in all the filth and depravity is a brief plane crash scene.  The director / writer of this garbage is typical hollywood.  When you aren't creative substitute heroin addiction, loveless sex,  immorality and a pig's eye view of humanity.  What garbage.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|I work for a television company as a customer service representative. I was told by multiple customers to check out Game of Thrones. So one day I booted up hbo go on my xbox 360. I watched the first episode which was a lot to take in. I took a break from it for a week or so. After that I decided to start episode 2. From that point on I had a marathon and finished season 1 and season 2 in less then 4 days! It was such an amazing show. I got this box set for Christmas and decided to watch it again with my brother. He hooked as well! We watched the whole box set in less than 24 hours! This is the best thing to happen to television! It's a must watch! 5 stars!

B0000007BI|5.0|This 'live' recording was made in 1996 as has a strikingly real and present sound without being so close as to be uncomfortable. The orchestra is a period ensemble and both that the the choir are of appropriate size for the period.<br /><br />As is widely known, Mozart did not live to complete this work but he did in fact complete substantial parts of it and the rest was sufficiently sketched out to allow Sussmayr, a confident of Mozart, to complete the work as it has regularly been performed for close to two centuries.<br /><br />There have been many alternative versions, particularly over the last 30 years or so and presented by various musicologists or scholars, but Herreweghe feels that this earlier version is still more authentic bearing in mind Sussmayr's relationship with Mozart and his understanding of Mozart's intentions. In this version, there have been minor adjustments where it has been felt that Sussmayr's work lacked the ultimate finesse. This all seems very reasonable to me and it certainly works well on this recording.<br /><br />The performance itself is both thorough and compelling - far from dry scholarship. The great advantage of period performances as here, is that everything can be heard as Mozart intended and in correct balance. Modern orchestras are simply out of scale in so many ways and cannot help clouding the finer details.<br /><br />I would put this on a par with Gardiner's fine performance as well as Peter Schreier's and choice between the three will boil down to personal preference. Gardiner is a little faster overall and more incisive at times and Schreier takes a remarkable three minutes off the total time. This may seem rushed on paper but the performance did receive the 1984 Choral Award from the Gramophone jury and cannot lightly be dismissed either. The well performed Kyrie is an attractive extra work but unlikely to be critical in making a final choice.<br /><br />I would suggest that any one of these three Sussmayr performances would give considerable satisfaction as an 'only' buy but collectors interested in alternative versions may well find all three worth possessing, like myself. On that basis I would also suggest that Hogwood and Bruno Weil also offer fine performances in alternative completions.s would give considerable satisfaction as an 'only' buy but collectors interested in alternative versions may well find all three worth possessing, like myself. On that basis I would also suggest that Hogwood and Bruno Weil also offer fine performances in alternative completions.

0143119680|5.0|This was a very good read. Would tell  any body that loves fantasy.to give it a try! Enjoyed from cover to cover
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|Even though &#34;found footage&#34; movies are supposed to be light on plot, this one is *too* plot-less. It's slow-moving. And unless you've seen the previous Paranormal Activity movies, you'll be totally flumoxed by the ending. Not recommended.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I LOVED this book I HIGHLY recommend this book! And if you haven't read the Percy Jackson series then you NEED to read that before you read this highly HILARIOUS ( book 2 in the hero's of Olympus series) book! This author is AMAZING and this series and the Percy Jackson series is my 2 FAVORITE book series! Which is saying something cause I read A LOT! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005JR47R6|5.0|This is the final season of a fantastic show. It develops nicely, the plot, the characters, the fictional world. It end leaving you with closure, something many shows utterly fail to do. It's a strong end to a great show.

0765325950|5.0|After two decades, over 10,000 pages, and countless characters and sub-plot lines, Jordan and Sanderson finally bring to a close the Wheel of Time. For those wanting a meaty tale of the Last Battle, you're in for a treat - this book dedicates over 200 pages to the epic clash between good and evil. You won't get resolution for every minor plot or character, but you get a good idea of how the world will look after the Last Battle and quite a few loose ends are tied to boot. Jordan himself wrote the ending, with little if no modification from Sanderson, so you know that you're reading the finale of Rand and co's story from the original author himself.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow! What a great book. I almost hate that I finished it, but glad that I did. It was a real \\"page-turner\\". Gillian did a great job of wanting you to keep reading to try and figure out what was  going to happen next, what twist the story would take. What a scary, calculating person Amy was.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves helping me feed and pet my horse. its something we do all the time and she gets so excited
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time.  Couldn't put it down.  Not a horror story like many Stephen King books.  A great read that takes you back to a much simpler time.
0062197266|5.0|Filled with tension. The novel goes back and forth between two time periods in the main character's life. Each period highlights a different type of tension and suspense. The earlier time period deals with an increasingly violent and abusive relationship and the fear involved. The second section's tension mostly revolves around the OCD the main character has developed as a result of the experiences from the first part.<br /><br />It sounds odd writing it out, but reading this book made me SO anxious and that was a great thing. Who wants to be anxious, right? But the author somehow expresses the main character's anxiety that well. I consider that pretty damn good writing.<br /><br />It's difficult to review this book without giving anything away, IMO. If you like authors like Tanya French, Sophie Hannah, Gillian Flynn, and/or Chevy Stevens, you will very likely enjoy this book.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I really liked Batman Begins when I saw it in the theatre and I pop it in every so often.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Kevin Spacey shines as a power-hungry Congressman gaming his way through the political system to get what he wants, alternately promoting and throwing others under the bus. Cynical, raw, cold but fascinatingly gripping, House of Cards paints a picture of Washington where good men go to die and only the most ruthless can work their way up the ladder. The series also boasts an impressive cast that's about as perfect as any TV series can be. Robin Wright and Kate Mara stand out though frankly the whole cast should be considered for award time.<br /><br />David Fincher has put his trademark stamp on the look and feel - the sense of betrayal, loss and glossy decay permeate every scene. The plot avoids the usual trap of getting increasingly absurd (Dexter, anyone?) and instead focuses on delivering a complex, broad story that's much more akin to a great novel. This is an update of a British series by the same name that was equally excellent but there's enough new material that you wouldn't necessarily know they were connected.<br /><br />Fans of political drama, Kevin Spacey or just plain good entertainment are going to love this Netflix Original series. It's actually the sole reason I reactivated my Netflix account -- apparently they are about to release a new season of Arrested Development as well. House of Cards is currently offered on Netflix streaming and the episodes have been released all at once so you can watch the season at your own speed, though I imagine a DVD set will be in the works soon.

B00ARAO720|5.0|I loved the action and the story line with the main character. didn't really care to much about the asian girl and her story. it definitely kept me entertained and it made me laugh at certain parts. Definitely gonna buy the movie in the future =)

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The trailer does leave the wrong impression. I thought it was gonna be an action flick. But it wasn't. The most interesting part of the movie was the plane scene after that it was really boring. After 25 minutes i found myself skipping to the end of the movie.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I wanted to read this book when it first came out. However, I couldn't find it in any stores as it was back ordered. lol This was actually how I got my first Kindle! My father let me log onto his acnt to order & read the book and afterwards ended up buying me a kindle of my own that I now I read almost every day :) I think many people were curious as to what happened to Jaycee during the years she was held captive and how her life is now that she is back home with her family. However, above reading those details I was suprised at how well written this book was! Jaycee is a very strong woman & forgiving woman. That is awesome that she was able to move past all the Garridos had done to her, and now willing to give them any more power over her by letting the evil things they did to her hold her in the past. This was a great read and leaves you feeling inspired. I hope Jaycee, her daughters & family enjoy their time back together & lotsof luck. If you are reading reviews of this book it is a def must read!

Daniel Craig is great as James Bond and the locations and action in the film is non stop and a treat to watch. Best James Bond film since Dr. No and in my top 5 of favorite Bond films. Job well done 007. The name is Bond James Bond.

B007REV4YI|5.0|The musical score for Skyfall is a masterpiece. Although I love Adelle's contribution, I am in awe over Thomas Newman's score. It is always a challenge for Bond films to do three things well: 1. Satisfy the Bond fanatics (count me in)  2. Make the current film's music unique- a work unto itself  3. Make the current film great.<br />  The orchestral score is totally recognizable as being Bond. Compare this to the last Bond movie- what a disaster! Alas, there is no solace to be found. I paid to see a Bond movie- and I want Bond music. Yes- this is my immature tantrum, but there is no need to cry now. I thought I died and went to heaven when the garage door went up an the Aston Martin DB5. Thank you Mr. Newman for that delight- it wouldn't have been the same without the classic Bond theme music! Chill bumps!<br />  Secondly, the music is so good- such a fine work unto itself that I am purchasing the score. Listen to it on your way to work or on your ipod while exercising. WOW. once again- kudos to Mr. Newman!<br />  Finally- never underestimate the importance of a movie's music. George Lucas had it right when he said it is \\"half of the movie\\". Star Wars is a great movie- but would have only been \\"good\\" if not for John Williams. Instead of cheesy synthesizer music, the full orchestral score makes it timeless. The Skyfall score is a huge reason for its success. One brilliant scene- listen to the driving percussion that electrifies Bond's fight with the assassin. It's an instant classic!<br />  Thomas Newman pulled it off- on all three accounts! Here's to hoping he does the next one!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I am amazed. I loved this book, not only I never wanted to put it down but this book has more meaning than anything else I ever read. Even though there are some ummm..weird part Teachers would like this book a lot and teenagers would need to know a lot of the things in this book and pets can listen. Thank you so much for writing this wonderful book.

B006FE83UE|5.0|If there still remains anyone who has not had the intense pleasure of experiencing this masterpiece of cinema and testament to one man's humanity and honor........ see it now. I do not know of any movie ever filmed that was so faithful to the book; so much so you felt you had already seen the movie as it played out across the screen. Gregory Peck simply IS Atticus Finch.

B007FH9GA6|4.0|I waited for the hype to die down before reading. I still don't fully understand it. Sometimes the writing is really choppy and factual without being relevant, like &#34;Lisbeth spent 5000 krona at the 7-11 before going home&#34; (I'm making that up, but it's not far off) which can be irritating. Also, if this is so women-kick-butt, ladies to the rescue, then why is Lisbeth referred to as a &#34;girl&#34; throughout this entire book? Is not 25 old enough to be considered a grown a** woman?

With this bag, everything fits.  no need for multiple bags.  It holds my 5100 w/ kit lens, a 70-200 F2.8, a 50mm prime lens, a SB-900 flash, a mono pod, and there's room for my 12&#34; laptop.
B009CURYYO|5.0|I have several books regarding quilting motifs, but this is the most comprehensive book I have purchased.  Not only is the book easy to use but offers indexes based on size, shape, and borders.  If I have a rectangle that is 5 x 8, it will point me to the patterns best suited for that size.  It also gives you tips on adapting motifs to suit a specific area.  Really happy with the purchase.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved that this book is set in a period that we can all relate to (right now).  Its fun to read how the characters go about solving the mystery and how it could be you doing all this because the references are so real.  I love this book from cover to cover, if you like technology and a good mystery pick this book up.

B004FN7ZOC|4.0|A dollop of At The Gates riffing, propulsive double-time drumming, some tasty, In Flames-styled twin-guitar harmonies, epic solos, irresistibly rhythmic, galloping rhythms, Viking metal-influenced lyricism, and raspy black metal vocals from \\"singer\\" Johan Hegg. That, essentially, is the formula for Amon Amarth's career -- and what a winning formula it is, too, as they've been pedaling it for some eighteen years and eight full-length albums, now. As a result, the Sweden-bred blackened-tinged melodic death metallers have become one of the most consistent groups in all of metal. And, as the saying goes, if it ain't dead, don't kill it! So, they provide more of the same on 2011's \\"Surtur Rising.\\"<br /><br />With that said, though, this album is heavier than most releases put out by A.A., as tracks like the blistering opener, \\"War Of The Gods,\\" with its fiery, thrashy chugging and stomping blast beats, attack with a ferocity seldom heard from this band. The song has just enough melody to be memorable, too, as it tucks in a winding, harmonic guitar solo before the end. Later tracks such as \\"A Beast Am I\\" (which is among the fastest tunes that this band has recorded to date), and the ripping \\"Destroyer Of The Universe,\\" further this brutal approach. Then there are songs like \\"Tock's Taunt/Loke's Treachery, Pt. II\\" and \\"Slaves Of Fear,\\" which are both steady beatings with industrial-strength, churning guitars, and brutal vocals. They also weave in some tasty melodic leads in between their At The Gates-esque galloping rhythms. And \\"Live Without Regrets,\\" which weaves in some harmonic leads into its thrashy, buzzsaw riffing and brutal vocals that recall Karl Sanders (of Nile fame). A really memorable chorus is also included, here. Other highlights include the slow, pounding, and almost purely doomy plod of \\"The Last Stand Of Frej\\"; and the really deft blasts and thrash beats of \\"For Victory Or Death.\\"<br /><br />While not the groundbreaking, watershed release that 2006's \\"With Oden On Our Side\\" or 2008's excellent \\"Twilight Of The Thunder God\\" were, \\"Sulfur Rising\\" is another very solid installment in the Amon Amarth catalogue. Complete with an immaculate production job from the very well-respected Jens Bogren (who has also worked with the likes of Opeth, Katatonia, and Soilwork), \\"Surtur\\" is everything you have come to expect from this Swedish quintet, and nothing more.h Oden On Our Side\\" or 2008's excellent \\"Twilight Of The Thunder God\\" were, \\"Sulfur Rising\\" is another very solid installment in the Amon Amarth catalogue.

0765325950|5.0|Wow what a book!  The magnitude of pulling the myriad story lines and characters together is a task not many could have successfully undertaken.  While it is easy to be critical I chose to simply enjoy this novel as if it were in fact real.  In doing so I felt the triumphs and griefs of each character.  Even the Dark one's!  It is this detail which has readied me to read it again shortly.  My favorite memory of the book was Lan.  He actually found words to express himself.  There's hope for many a quiet man!!

0865478007|5.0|America's health system is the world's costliest, by far - consuming 18% of GDP, compared to 12% for #2 Switzerland and 8% for serious competitors Taiwan and Japan and only 4% for Singapore. Dr. Ben Goldacre's 'Bad Pharma' helps explain why this is so. In a nutshell, it's because the evidence used to make medical decisions is hopelessly and systematically distorted.<br /><br />Specifically, drugs are tested mostly by their manufacturers on small numbers of unrepresentative patients, and analyzed using deliberately flawed techniques that exaggerate their benefits. When trials bring results that manufacturers don't like, they're often hid from doctors and patients - thus, we only see distorted pictures of their true effects. And finally, academic papers thought to be objective are often written by those working for the manufacturers, without disclosure. Sometimes the journals are even owned by a drug company.<br /><br />Some of the stories told by Dr. Goldacre make you question the integrity of those involved, others will make you angry or sad. It's all thanks to perverse incentives. Goldacre justifiably prides himself on using 'systematic reviews' (unbiased surveys of all the evidence) to make his points, using individual studies only to add detail.<br /><br />Pharmaceutical companies spend twice as much on marketing and advertising as on R&D of new drugs. New drugs must only prove that they are better than nothing, even when highly effective treatments already exist. Data on side effects and effectiveness can be withheld from regulators.<br /><br />Three researchers in 2010 reviewed all the drug trials (over 500) involving antidepressants, ulcer drugs, and three other major categories. Eighty-five percent of the industry-funded studies were positive, buy only 50% of the government funded trials. Similarly, in 2007 researchers looked at every published trial (192) of cholesterol-lowering statins, and found industry-funded trials 20X more likely to give results favoring the test drug. Cherry-picking of the data explains the differences. Sometimes the result is that hundreds of thousands of patients die, unnecessarily - Avandia, Fen Phen, Vioxx.<br /><br />Contract Research Organizations are a new phenomenon now providing over half the clinical trials; global revenues of $20 billion in 2010, about one-third of all pharma R&D spending. In 2008 they ran over 9,000 trials, with over 2 million participants in 115 countries. Use of private community doctors in the U.S. for conducting trials has also greatly expanded, with payments near $1 million for the most enterprising. Quintiles, the largest CRO company offers to help drug companies 'better identify, promote, and prove the value of a particular drug to key stakeholders.' Some CRO contracts share the risk of a poor outcome with the drug companies, further increasing the likelihood of of slanted results beyond simply the desire to retain business. Running a trial in the U.S. costs $30,000/patient (per a GSK executive), $3,000 in Romania. Thus, lots of outsourcing to poorer countries where regulatory oversight is poorer and corruption more prevalent. Genetic differences in drug reactions present another problem.<br /><br />Lobbyists help get their way via sponsoring socializing events, hiring leading experts as consultants or advisers, giving out research grands, and hiring former regulators. Similarly with those sitting on agency advisory boards. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find members of advisory boards who are not compromised in some way. Often drugs are approved despite showing no benefit to real-world outcomes such as heart attacks or death - eg. statins vs. cholesterol levels and heart attacks, anti-arrhythmic drugs vs. death rates (doxazosin - CAST study). Detecting side effects can require years.<br /><br />Drug marketers sometimes use biased surveys. Example - Eli Lilly posed ten Internet questions to detect potential depression; answering 'No' to all ten brought a 'You may be at risk for major depression' response. Drug-company sponsored CME programs are another problem.<br /><br />Drug firms have been fined up to $3 billion (GSK), but Goldacre says this is minor compared to the revenues involved.<br />Bottom-Line: Readers will be well served by 'Bad Pharma' and the lessons it offers.ht a 'You may be at risk for major depression' response.

B0087ITBT8|5.0|This movie has a perfect combination of comedy and drama.  Streisand never fails to amaze and Rogen showed a much wider range of acting than he has shown in the past. He could be an equally effective dramatic actor as he is in comedy.  As for Streisand, 'please don't wait so long to make a movie!'  No matter what Streisand does in a movie, you can be assured that it is well worth seeing.  I could sit through 'Guilt Trip' a dozen times and not get bored.

B006IDG2T6|5.0|Mr. Harris thesis is one which can be very hard to stomach, hard to intuitively understand. Nevertheless, he argues persuasively and provides many examples. I for one do not feel disheartened or disillusioned by knowing that we are not &#34;the captains&#34; of our ships. Like Harris, I feel it has empowered me to understand the limits of our conscious reach and my world view, the way I think about moral and political matter and much more has changed for the better. Of course, I am sure thee are many philosophers and scientists who will disagree with Harris on some of his claims and conclusions, this is after all a fairly young area of research. But his book is nevertheless very well argued, easily read and very informative. A book no inquiring mind should leave unread.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The writers give you no reason to cheer or identify with the main character.  I spent the whole movie wishing he would just go to jail and get it over with.  If you like movies where you watch someone just train wreck their lives in slow motion, then have at it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I enjoyed reading American Sniper. It is a tragedy that one of the marines he tried so hard to help was the one who killed him. I am so happy that he testified to trusting in The Lord Jesus Christ as his Saviour. So for sure his sins were paid in full whether people believe he was justified or not. He is in heaven!

B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is one of my favorite shows.  All of the characters work so well together and I hope they don't get rid of anyone anytime soon.  It's a great show and I highly recommend it.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This is a good portrayal of the decade long, herculean task left to a small group of CIA operatives and specifically one determined woman. The story has several twists, setbacks, and surprises, and goes across several countries before winding down to a laserlike focus on Abbotabad by the CIA.<br /><br />A lot's been said about the presentation of torture in this movie and the movie leaves it fairly up in the air in terms of its effectiveness. It is definitely not a pro-torture movie. The actual abuses on display here are fairly tame as far as torture methods go.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain puts in a good performance here as the mastermind who tries to all the clues together. She puts on a tough face, but as personal toll mounts higher, her vulnerable side peeks through and she becomes ever more determined to complete the mission. Jason Clarke is dashing as a brutal CIA agent, and Jennifer Ehle, Mark Strong, and Chris Pratt round out a the cast nicely.<br /><br />This is a very good manhunt movie with an interesting look at the key players in that manhunt, and if you like CIA spy stuff there's some of that too.

But the delivery was very fast, the package looks so good and I think this is the beginning to get a good movie for children. As a matter of fact, I think that the director and the starring is not very important for them.

Would be nicer to have a little modularity, be able to move the pouches around etc. Also dont count on mounting a sidearm holster on the side, youd never reach it. Holds my 6 AR mags and another 6 pistol mags securely and after it was adjusted properly, it wasnt restrictive or awkward

B003B02O14|5.0|thoroughly good experience because it is so well written and you come to know and enjoy the characters .  As with most books, even very good ones, the ending was a little obvious and not all you would hope for.  But it was well worth the price.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Almost everyone knows of Abraham Lincoln and his leadership during America's struggle to eradicate slavery and maintain the union. However this books delves deeply into LIncoln's unique blend of emotional and intellectual intelligence. It brings to life the love that this formidable man had for his country, democracy and mankind. It is a book that anyone who is becoming cynical with western democracy or who is in a position of leadership should read. By the end of the book I was in tears as Goodwin tenderly covered the last few hours of Lincoln's life, but at the same time I was re-energised  by the hope that democracy, under the leadership of great, compassionate people, does and will prevail.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Nice. Very well ireland music. The voice and guitar of Mark Knopfler is absolutelly and unique. I love it and hear every time.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The read is quick and easy the work is another matter. I like the fact that the book does not sugar coat the fact that getting into any kind of shape is hard work and metal discipline.  I am very much looking going to try and follow this book and post updates as I progress.
B00004Y6NT|3.0|I tihnk the old and remasterized records prevent we  hear the pure sound. But it's normal for this kind of records.. Unfortunatelly the technollogy avaiable fo this moment was not the best for records. That's is alll.

I thought I was getting a DVD of the concert and an added Blu-Ray. BUT, the dvd was of a rehearsal and the concert was on the Blu-Ray. I do not own a Blu-Ray player and have yet to view the actual concert. Now I recall there were several packages offered, some didn't even include the concert dvd. The cd's were great. I might have rated higher if I was able to see the concert.

Follett is a master of sweeping historical epics that cleverly weave many characters together to form an entertaining plot.  This is a particularly ambitious effort that attempts to piece together a story involving Russian, American, English, Welsh, and German families.  I enjoyed the book, but it requires some tolerance for the reader to accept the many coincidences that cause their paths to cross at so many major historical events in the mid-twentieth century.  The Russian connection is the weakest link and this would have been a better series if the focus had been limited to an English and German family.  Follett has always favored strong female characters, but went a little overboard with 21st century political correctness with introduction of a gay couple (among other things).  Hopefully the social agenda volume will be turned down in the final episode.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this book the best of all three.  I think that it was very well written.  I can't wait to see the movie!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book but not as much as the first two.  Maybe because it was the end.  Enjoyable reading.
B002GHHHP6|4.0|I Love westerns It was great to see James Garner again  in a Maverick  watched him as a kid.<br />I don't know why the have to ruin it with the SEX It could of been left out and been a better movie
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|When I first started reading this book I thought I had dropped into \\"teenage land\\". But, the more I got into it, I quickly found out I was wrong.  No spoiler here, but this book deals with a very hard subject and how it is dealt with is truly phenonimal.  Sky is a very deep,compassionate and funny girl who has a way of filling you in on those feelings that is well...just plain satisfying!  Holder is the guy every girl dreams about meeting, intelligent, thoughtful,funny and as his relationship with Sky continues you can't help but fly from page to page to see what is going to happen next; and, believe me, a whole lot happens!  Set aside some time to really delve into this book - you won't be sorry.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Where's the legendary Aerosmith we all know and love, the Aerosmith that can rock joints and play the blues like it's 1932 (Honkin' On Bobo)?<br /><br />Well, they are still here...somewhat.<br /><br />Their new album, Music From Another Dimension, has many high points...and, at the same time, many low points.<br /><br />The high points will, in my opinion, blow you away. Joe Perry's back on lead vocals (Freedom Fighter--by the way his voice sounds very differently nowadays compared to his lead vocals on Walk on Down from Get a Grip), and he knows how to deliver the goods in bringing blues and hard rock TOGETHER AS ONE! His solo on Street Jesus is mesmerizing, and \\"The Demon of Screamin',\\" Steven Tyler, impeccably backs him up with his bluesy, soulful voice (even if there are far better ways to write songs about Jesus!) You'll either love or hate Legendary Child, but if you love it, you'll sense classic Aerosmith from Perry and Tyler, as well as from Tom Hamilton, Brad Whitford, and Joey Kramer: apparently, this song comes from the Pump era. It's easy to tell when listening to it, and it's nice to know that on Music From Another Dimension, Aerosmith has given their fans a gift from their past. Again, another great moment for rock and blues mixed together!<br /><br />In my opinion, Freedom Fighter, Street Jesus (aside from the lyrics), and Legendary Child are the only moments of perfection on Music From Another Dimension. Songs like Luv XXX and Lover Alot are saved only by Aerosmith themselves. Without Aerosmith, they would be nothing, and are very immature songs to have been written by men in their 60's.<br /><br />Ballads like What Could Have Been Love and Can't Stop Lovin' You (a duet between Aerosmith and Carrie Underwood) are very pretty (I know that some people HATE Aerosmith collaborating with Carrie Underwood, but aside from how odd it is, she and Steven did a beautiful job singing it together, with Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, Brad Whitford, and co-producer Marti Fredericksen backing them up in the songwriting department). However, in spite of ballads like these and Closer (opinions may differ but I think most people would agree that Steven is the song's hope), Music From Another Dimension suffers from having too many ballads on it! The ballads themselves are very pretty musically, but just don't cut it for Aerosmith. They would be better off in the care of someone like Michael Bolton or Bryan Adams (funny coincidence with Jim Vallance being Steven and Joe's co-writer on Legendary Child). Diane Warren gave us an Aerosmith classic with I Don't Want to Miss a Thing, but on We All Fall Down, she proves that she's lost that special touch to her (at least where Aerosmith is concerned).<br /><br />As for the remaining tracks (Oh Yeah, Beautiful, Tell Me, and Out Go the Lights), what we have here is pop that finds Aerosmith conforming to 2012's music scene. Not bad, but again, ***just not Aerosmith***.<br /><br />I understand that every band and solo artist (no matter what decade they first became famous in) must conform (somewhat) to the current music scene in order to survive. However, other reviews of Music From Another Dimension will show you that there have been many Aerosmith fans dissatisfied with MFAD. Hopefully, just hopefully, Steven, Joe, Brad, Tom, and Joey will hear the cries of the dissatisfied fans for the Aerosmith we all came to know and love back in the 70's.rti Fredericksen backing them up in the songwriting department).

B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I'm not going to review the movies themselves, because it is pointless. Everyone and their grandmother as seen Indiana Jones before and knows these are classic movies.    I'm just going to simply say that this is the very nearly the definitive version of the Indiana Jones Anthology, and there is a load of extra features with interviews, behind the scenes footage, and featurettes. The transfer of a 30 year old film to Blu Ray is amazing and the 5.1 audio is spot on and improves on previous releases. The only reason that it is merely very nearly the definitive version is because there is no commentary for any of the movies.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Paul Newman anti-heroes all the way to classic filmdom in this late '60s gem.  Many good young actors -- and some not so young in George Kennedy -- including, my favorite, Harry Dean Stanton, billed as Dean Stanton.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book really drew me in...the plot, the characters, the twists!  I can't wait to read the next two books in the trilogy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really did love it!  The story was very well told, interesting, as you just didn't want to put your<br />kindle down.  Suspenseful, not knowing what was happening next.  The richness of the characters<br />was explained so well, one felt they really knew them, so much you cried, laughed and thought<br />you were with these people as their lives came together.<br />I would recommend this book to my family and close friends.
B00881VLCE|4.0|this is a cool app but they don't have very many puzzles to pick from unless you purchase more but the ones they have are great and fun to do
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games and I loved it. Then I read Catching Fire an  I loved it even more! Catching Fire is a very suspenseful book and I loved it!!!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I was especially impressed when I realized I can record audio from my boom mic and the internal mic at the same time! Great sound recording device. This allows me to record audio separate from my camera. Awesome quality and awesome product!
0385344228|4.0|I have never written a review on Amazon, but felt compelled to do so. As a prosecutor myself, I found the premise of this book quite intriguing; a 14-year-old boy is charged with the murder of his classmate and his father is a well respected career prosecutor.<br /><br />I really appreciated the narrative of this book.  While the narrator has lived his life on the \\"right side of the law\\" despite his less than desirable genealogy, he has an unwavering belief in his son's innocence despite several pieces of evidence to the contrary.  Which makes his actions both believable and unbelievable at the same time.  I think he portrayed the essence of humanity and fatherhood. He is not perfect and in many ways unreliable, and while smart and accomplished in many ways of his life, may be a bit failing in perceiving the needs of his family.<br /><br />My only complaint is with some of the legal inaccuracies, which were aggravated in knowing the author is a former prosecutor.  While I know the law is frustratingly boring at times, and it is hard to write a compelling narrative under the strictures of the rules of evidence, there was so much about the grand jury testimony and the trial testimony that was blatantly inadmissible and unrealistic that it drew me out of the narrative.  And don't even get me started on the irony of his former colleague trying to paint Andy Barber as acting with a conflict of interest through out the trial, yet he had zero conflict in prosecuting the son of his mentor???--my head spins.  However, my protestations aside on the legal technicalities, it was a good read and I would recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't wait for each new episode to come out!  A great story with great characters, everyone should see this.

B008KW43TE|1.0|I love R&B. In fact, I love music. Period. But.....this?? This album right here?? I REALLY don't get the hype!! I was bored from the first word.The song \\"Thinking Bout You\\" has been overplayed so I was not looking  forward to  hearing that song again. It is, in my opinion the best song on the album, but that is not saying much because I really didn't care THAT much for that one either. After this guy won the Grammy,  I decided to  check it out. WOW! I am sooooooo disappointed. Not at ALL what I thought it would be!! Save your money!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! The only way it could be better is have it cost less for horses and stuff, I still love this game when I have connection
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is really good the only problem is that when you get bored of Rio you should be able to  go to settings and change the place
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I was deeply moved by the profound insight, compassion and humanity of this book.  I was telling everyone about Harold's encounters and what I learned from them.  I was there with him for every mile.  Very moving.  Margalis Fjelstad

B00846F1YW|1.0|I thought I would try out this game since it was free. The first part went just fine and then I got some award or something and it wouldn't let me go forward untill I posted my award on facebook or tweeted about it. There was no going forward without posting about it so I uninstalled it. The end.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books.  This one had realistic characters and a believable plot that left you guessing when her past would catch up with her.  I loved the ending and can't wait to see the movie!  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks novels and romance/intrigue fiction.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|man I am glad she finally killed bill great movie good price you should buy this movie even if your name is bill~

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this app better than the original app! Its a bit more challenging and more fun in my opinion! :)
0345472322|1.0|This book is identical to Dweck's 2006 book \\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.\\" If you own or have read that book, there's no need to get this one.<br /><br />It strikes me as basically dishonest to market this book as a different title, as Amazon does. For example: Amazon offers to bundle these two books (with a third) for a discount price--the obvious implication being that they are not the same book.<br /><br />The book itself is fine (I'd rate it a 4 stars by itself), but the misleading information prompts this review.
034580404X|5.0|I understand the popularity of the series, but it was a little too much for this &#34;old fashioned&#34; girl to deal with.  I prefer a little more left to the imagination....actually,  A  LOT more!

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this cd, and we play it often when we are travelling around the state.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I'm still amazed that this LCD monitor arm is as inexpensive as it is. This is a very solidly-built item. I used it on a high-top table that was converted to a standing desk, and was able to install it in minutes. All hardware and tools are included in the package. The unit installs with a clamp, but can also be flush-mounted through the table top if needed. Each pivot point can have its tightness adjusted with the included hex wrenches. So if you have a lighter monitor, you can  loosen up certain pivot points you will be using a lot. Even the cable guides are nice and solid, so you have a place to run the wires from the monitor to the PC. I will definitely buy other items from Ergotron as I need them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I cannot believe how cool this game is. you always have thee chance to buy another life. the runner also doesn't. go super fast. the graphics are UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!! best game I've seen in a long time. so many more power ups. I &lt;3 this game.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham did a good job- twists and turns were quite interesting, convoluted and at times surprising but logical! Would recommend this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story of Sky is so heartbreaking. It rocked my world and knocked it off the axis for a bit. Once again Colleen you knocked it out of the park. This book was just plan amazing. It was creatively written, just when I thought I had it figured out you surprised me.
B0010T0QNQ|4.0|I work in a professional kitchen and have used many different brands of shoes. These are the most comfortable by far. Great non-slip sole and great cushion for standing on your feet for 10 hours a day. These run a little big, but not too big that I felt I had to return them (this is why I deducted one star). I choose white ones because I am a pizzaiolo and work with flour all day long. Yes, there are many other kitchen shoes that are a lot cooler (I'm thinking Mozo) but for the price, you will not be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome!!! and has a lot of activities that keeps u interested. I would only suggest that they make the time for task to complete shorter and the treats cheaper, but all in all its great fun!!!
B004LWZW9M|5.0|New Year's Eve--Humorous, sweet, good message, A-list actors, good plot. All around a very enjoyable film that can be watched over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a really fun app but most stuff wants you to get your personal information like your email address and your email password so if you do not want to get it its ok because I understand if you don't want your Money taken:)
B004DHUAZQ|1.0|I couldn't even finish it. Waste of rental bucks. My opinion. Yours may be different Five more words required in absentia
B000JQU1VS|4.0|i love this game keeps you busy on a rainy day. love to play games and stay busy . .
B004I8WD7S|5.0|The case fits perfectly, is easy to install, and has a &#34;slick rubber&#34; feel to it that I dig. It doesn't pick up pocket lint and dirt like some others, and yet seems to provide good enough protection against nicks and dings. It wouldn't protect against dropping your phone from the second story, but that's the tradeoff for not having a lunchbox wrapped around your phone.<br /><br />The only minor issue I have with it is that the screen cover was hard to install. I don't know if that's me not knowing what I'm doing or if it's the cover itself. I didn't like having a cover on it anyway so I threw it away, but if you're into covering your screen, think about it.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|i love this game keeps you busy on a rainy day. love to play games and stay busy . .
0345803485|1.0|I have never written a review but I have to! Seriously, I cannot believe what a heap of crap these books are. I watched a Barbara Walters special recently and the author was on as one of the most fascinating people of the year (YAWN!) I was going on a beach holiday so I figured these would be great beach books, so I bought the trilogy. OMG I was so wrong. They are so boring, so repetitive, so poorly written. I should have read the amazon reviews and not based my purchase on Ms.Walters or the few women I know who loved it. I cant see how they got thru it! I wont repeat all of the things others have written here. If you are looking for any kind of a story or interesting characters, do not read these books. I cannot understand how she wrote 3 books, almost 1500 pages, where basically nothing happens, except they have sex on every other page, which becomes redundant and repetitive and after about the 3rd time, is no longer hot. The amount of money this woman is raking in is ludicrous, I'm jealous because I think I could have done at least as good a job. And I hear they are going to make a movie about it. If you want a complex relationship, sub/dom etc watch \\"Secretary\\" with James Spader, is pretty good. Please don't waste your time or money on these books. They are not even good \\"bad\\" beach books. They are just bad. If you do want to read them, I will send you my copy for free!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Show keeps you guessing on who did the murder. Beckett and Castle have a great time on their research and love of each other

B00AKL1XPU|4.0|great game..no problems yet on my kindle fire.  There's hardly any way to get peanuts unless you buy them and they are insanely expensive (as in needing $9.99 for a giraffe...really??)  I will put some money in a game...but not that much!  Other than that it's a great game...but the developers are missing the boat by not making peanuts a lot cheaper.  They'd make more money in the long run.  I'm almost done...no good animals left to capture.
B002BGCCZC|5.0|This is an incredible album! They are so amazing! Love it! Anything Muse puts out is awesome! Listen over and over ...
B006S8QB2O|4.0|I loved this movie...  I shows that no matter how successful you are, or think you are and no matter how old you are, the art of dance can bring you joy.  I love the closeness the way the group came together and I also loved the love between the husband and wife.<br /><br />Great movie to see...  Romantic, sweet....
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I like the story line reminds me of a more modern X files. I love being able to watch it on my own terms with prime.
B008KPDYQY|3.0|From the clips I was anxious to see this movie, however I was a bit disappointed.  I found that the most humorous parts in the movie were the clips they showed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am embarrassed for people who have not heard of Downton Abbey.  I wonder how big is their world?  However, that is not really fair since we all walk in different avenues for leisure time.  I got very sick with the flu during Christmas into New Years and I just kept watching them over and over.  I could revisit the glamorous scenery.  More importantly, I was able to interpret some of the key lines the characters said and they had more meaning.  I would suggest this series to anyone who wants to increase their appetite for British entertainment.  The plot is fantastic, the acting is flawless and the scenes are breathtaking.  The wait for each Sunday night's broadcast is excruciating!
B000WN7NEQ|5.0|This was an awesome movie...  I loved the way the different cultures meshed and came together fora common good.  The music and dancing was great.  This movie to me is a keeper...  a must see for all.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I gave this a five star for the beauty of the scenery, the subject had credibility, and the acting was fantastic.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves British history, art and theatre interests!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great show, not for the faint at heart, absolutely fabulous. Makes you think, laugh, love. Walter steals the show every time and Peter is to die for!!!!!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best tv series I've seen. I would advise waiting for them to all come out at once so that you're not left in cliffhangers every week
034580404X|5.0|I had borrowed the first book from a friend and liked it so much I wanted my own copy.  Great Deal and I Love the books.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I was just so excited that this was on amazon that I didn't pay attention to the fact that it was only highlights. I wouldn't have purchased it. I wish I would have paid more attention and just waited for the full soundtrack.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I'll admit the first almost half of the book was a little tedious as it went through how all the things that had happened in Lisbeths life came about and why but necessary and totally worth it for the last half of the book. Very satisfying.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing bingo blitz. I play it on my iPhone and my kindle fire. I like playing but there are time when on both of devices that the game freeze up and it does not recognize my Bingos so that is a little frustrating.
B004SGWYW4|3.0|It was a little bit more of girl drama in most parts of it. Each girl fighting for the love of the main character. The action made the anime worth the buy but that was about it. If I had to rank this anime between a score of 1-10 (1 being the worse anime I ever saw and 10 being the best anime I have seen ever) I would rate it a 6, because of the relationship between Takashi and Rei, and the fact that this topic of a zombie &#34;flick&#34; is a more unique twist of the versions of most zombie films .In this one the most clear unique factor of it is that the zombies cannot see but can hear and move to the designated spot the sound came from. So to conclude this review, if you are into action then this anime is for you if you want a more unique zombie blood and guts anime or drama. BUY IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE BREAST AND BLOOD.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I love this duo.  Am very happy with the CD (Together).  I keep watching their appearances on Britan's  Got Talent.  Cam't watch it enough!
B001N2UXU6|5.0|Absolutely incredible album and to listen to it on vinyl is amazing- it makes your whole body echo. Every song on this album is brilliant in it's own right and sure they sound relatively similar in some ways- these guys definitely have \\"a sound\\" but this sound is so good you're gonna need all these tracks and still want more!
1401223176|5.0|Great batsman book a must read for any fan of the batman Jeph Loeb does amazing work here. Amazing art as well
B003TSEEDY|2.0|But I thought it was a bit contrived. I was hoping for maybe a deeper look into the story than the movie but it almost seems  to be the screenplay of the movie word for word. I don't like books like that. Granted I finished the whole book because I did enjoy the movie. The main character cried a lot more than I have ever comfortably read anyone cry in my life. I almost wish I could return this book.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I'm a new comer to the series, but so far so good.  You have to be patient to read these but the character development is great.
B000001EUP|1.0|Really liked this album when it came out, but was really disappointed when i re-bought it on cd.<br />It's dated, and Klaus Meines voice is more annoying than i could remember.<br />Stay Clear!
B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|We are having difficulty with the HD. Parts of the show blink green for a few seconds every minute or so. Anyone else having this problem? If we watch it in standard, the problem does way. hmm...
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Had been waiting to see this and then could not quit watching it. For those of us in the &#34;baby boomer&#34; age group it hits the spot. Funny with depth of story and characters. It is out on loan to friends and I hope I get it back!! If not I will be purchasing another one.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Many pictures to choose from. You can add additional subjects to make doing puzzles even more fun.Colors are bright and crisp. I have enjoyed Magic Puzzles.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Is it the music? or the location? or the accents? or the characters? what ever it is I have seen this movie about 30 times. I just let it play in the back ground and look up for my favorite parts. I kept looking in stores for the $5 dollar version. It never appeared so I finally just had to pay the price and thank you Amazon for still selling it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I like the way I was able to receive all 3 books in 1 trilogy download to my Kindle. Makes reading very easy. Very good read too!!!

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Awesome CD.  Not so impressed with the &#34;extras&#34; on the DVD.  But if your a fan, this is a must buy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun game but the interface is complicated and just some lags and long loading at the beginning.<br />Also can you make earning coins more easier please?
B00364K6YW|5.0|The picture quality is good and happy with price.The picture quality is good and happy with price. there should not be a minimum/maximun amount of words to validate survey.

B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Saw this one in theater and watched again (streaming) at home. Excellent script, directing and performances by Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, John Goodman (a scene stealer), Kelly Reilly & Bruce Greenwood. Not exactly what you expect from the trailers. A well-done portrait of a complicated, troubled, self-destructive man whose life is spiraling out of control in the middle of a media frenzy forcused on a heroic act in which he defies all odds and saves a doomed airliner.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child has created a new Jack Reacher thriller.  I have just discovered this series and have been 100% won over as a fan.  I would not be writing this otherwise.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Very intriguing. Gillian Flynn creates warped characters you as actually root for and want to end up with happily ever after. They don't.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana Del Rey has an amazing voice and I am overall mesmerized by her songs and voice!  Both this and Born to Die are super awesomely great!
B007THA4FI|5.0|It's best to put aside any preconceptions you might have about what The Casual Vacancy will be like before you read it. That's hard to do in any situation, but when the author is J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, that's even more so; no matter what, you'll have certain expectations or ideas about what The Casual Vacancy might be like. It's to Rowling's credit, I think, that the book defies almost any expectation anyone had, delivering not a genre book, not a light-hearted book, but a cynical, dark look at modern society, politics, poverty, strained family relationships, and more. Nominally, The Casual Vacancy is about the aftermath of a death in a small English town, a death which opens up a seat on the ruling body in the town (the titular vacancy). But in reality, Rowling uses the death as a way to open up this insular world and its dramas for the reader to explore. Rowling's working with a sprawling cast of characters here, and her effortless gliding between perspectives, dialects, philosophies, and thoughts is just one of the many joys for someone like me who was curious how her prose would differ as she took on the adult world. Indeed, Rowling's prose and craft is generally superb, weaving between the past and present, sliding between characters, and juggling dozens of plot threads only to collide them at unexpected moments - it's a masterful performance from a technical perspective, and left me impressed with just how far Rowling had come from the first Potter novel so many years ago. The subject matter has been more problematic for some people, with some feeling lost in just how ferociously cynical and vicious The Casual Vacancy can be. While Rowling has created dozens of rich characters, none of them are heroes, and not one is without a flaw - sometimes, there are a multitude of them. That's led some to discount the book as being without likeable characters, which is an absurd charge to me; while there are no doubt some despicable people here, it's not hard to feel that Rowling has a surprising amount of empathy for all of them (albeit some more than others). Similarly, the subject matter here can be dark, but that's appropriate; with much of the book revolving around the town's effort to rid itself of the government housing for the poor and the drug clinic that's helping many escape their addictions, it would be absurd and offensive to minimize the suffering and difficulty that comes along with such a life. Instead, Rowling focuses beautifully on both sides, attempting to understand those who look down on the inhabitants of the projects while also attempting to be a voice for those who had no chance at anything better. If you take The Casual Vacancy as, in effect, a debut novel, you'll be deeply impressed; while there are no doubt a few missteps (for example: there's a subplot about hacking that feels a bit repetitive and a bit like a deus ex machina, and occasionally the massive cast gets a bit overwhelming and confusing), what you have here is an assured, confident step into the literary world. Rowling is taking a huge gamble here, trading her genre work in for something more literary, trading her hopefulness in for brutal realism, and focusing a lot on the many ways that human beings can find themselves lacking in empathy for even those they love. The end result is a fantastic novel, one that I read pretty much any time I had free moments, and one that hit me pretty hard as it came to its powerful climax. It's not often enough that novelists are willing to write about social classes and the conflicts between them, or the way that politics can obscure our basic humanity towards each other, and yet Rowling takes both issues on, all while spinning tales about parents and children, the way we cope with loss, and so much more. For its short length, The Casual Vacancy is an ambitious, complex novel, but it's also a very human one underneath that - and to me, that may be the most important thing.it's not hard to feel that Rowling has a surprising amount of empathy for all of them (albeit some more than others).

B004G600A4|5.0|Great quality video! Movie was entertaining and fun to watch! Our girls loved the story! Disney always makes great movies!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This is a superbly written plot with much hilarity for readers. The insightless protagonist gradually gains insight and the reader becomes more familiar with the tribulations of an Aspergers sufferer trying to find a mate. Loved this book. Highly recommended as an engaging light read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use. Kills time while traveling. An old favorite game. Keeps the boredom away. Color on screen is good.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Crude and hilarious! We laughed out loud at this funny money. We love Ted and after a few minutes forgot that he was a teddy bear.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|It's fun, but the &#34;clients&#34; are goofy looking.  I wish there were more clients to choose from.  Otherwise, it's clever.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|We shared this movie with our daughter for the first time. It is a must watch for any Catholic during the Lenten Season. Touching and really makes you dig deeper into your faith.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I really enjoyed this show and I can't wait for the new season!  It is smart and fun and keeps you guessing the whole time.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child have the character development down perfect.  One has to be patient but it is worthwhile.  I can't wait for another installment.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A great series!  The characters are perfectly portrayal.  The plots and story lines move quickly.  Can be compared to &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34;.
B009KHCT94|3.0|A decent movie - some funny - some irreverant.  Overall worth the rental. A sequal would be very difficult, however a prequal would be interesting.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I had this game for a while. I built with sand. Game is updated. My house is destroyed.  ALL the sand fell.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love this show. Never watched it on regular TV and wish I would have. So many things I've never thought of, every episode had a fresh idea.
B000QE1U9K|4.0|I feel that the story was above average and most of the actors did really well. However, this movie seems a tad long for essentially repeating the story of &#34;Alien,&#34; but taking place at a different locale. I think it would have been much better had the movie been about 20-30m less. Since this movie is simply repeating a plot, it relies more on the grotesque to give the audience something new. Yes, compared to the first two movies, I found this one and &#34;Alien Resurrection&#34; to be unnecessarily disgusting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|all i can say is that its way better then the first and they might do better we just do not kno
B008RXYOKY|1.0|I ordered this to transfer data from my new iMac to my laptop.  It is irritating that Apple changes the mechanism from FireWire to Thunderbolt necessitating purchasing another product.  When it arrived, it did not fit my laptop (FireWire connection) as the pins were wrong.<br /><br />It would probably have worked great if it had been the right one.  Just be careful that you check your FireWire pins before you order an adapter.
0446547603|5.0|This book left me speechless. It is the best romance novel i have ever read throughout my existence. SPOILER ALERT: Her husband came back!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Saga is a riveting triumph of Science Fiction splendor. I was amazed at how realized and personal each character became, if he has parallels to some of the figures in real life I would not be surprised. Each moment and page in this book will own your undivided attention. Wool spans a wide crevasse of emotions from the romantic and heartfelt, to times where you are literally digging grooves with your fingernails into the palms of your hands. The writer has an incredible mastery over drawing in the reader through pacing and simple, yet meaningful analogies. Howey is a literary Beethoven. If your mind is not completely blown after reading this book you are brainless.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|This is the first full album I have ever purchased. The songs were so great on youtube, that I decided to support this guy fully. I'm even liking this album more than the non acoustic version. A lot of my friends (males in their early 20's) have hated on JB. This album has actually won a lot of them over. Kind of funny how being a young artist is. Its like, people don't like that he was so young and got so famous. People demand that he \\"impresses\\" before they even consider listening to him. Due to his age, people expect that he out performs anyone else. So what I'm hoping....I hope that JB keeps out performing himself in the coming years as opposed to making an album \\"good enough\\" in his early years that makes him kind of settle and and not push to the next level. Keep pushing man!<br /><br />One of the reasons I love that he sang acoustically... Just before he got famous I heard his youtube covers of various songs when he was like 10 years old. He was killllling it. I would just listen to his acoustic covers because they sounded so damn good. And FINALLY he releases a fully acoustic album.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|I chose this book based on the reviews I read and am so happy I did. The description of the building of the aquaduct and the way it functioned was very interesting. I visited Pompeii last summer and recognized some parts of the city.  The human element made the story more personal.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Again the reason that I gave this movie four stars is because of the technical problems which was disappointing. I had to revisit this movie an hour later in order to watch it in its entirety. The action in this movie was captivating. It stimulated your interest at every turn. I like action movies but only movies that you can involve yourself in with a great story line . In my opinion the story is the movie and this movie meets that requirement. It was good intertainment.
B0025KW29U|5.0|One of the most common complaints about Dr. Horrible-- its seemingly abbreviated running time-- is in my opinion one of its greatest strengths.  This is largely because every scene in the movie needs to be there, with no padding or fluff to invite inconsistencies. Every song in the musical is likewise under three minutes, but the lyrics are more clever than those of many Broadway musicals, if I may say so.  Nearly every line of every song is genius, and immensely fun to sing aloud if you're into that sort of thing.  All the actors look like they're having a really great time, especially Nathan Fillion.  All of them are absolutely perfect in their roles.<br /><br />Basically it's about an ineffectual wannabe supervillian (Neil Patrick Harris) who's too moral to get ahead, and the idealistic girl he's in love with (Felicia Day) who volunteers with the homeless and doesn't know his secret identity.  Actually she doesn't know his layperson identity either at the beginning, but then he talks to her and a whole lot of stuff happens very fast after that.  It's cute, funny and touching, and I'm not willing to give away any details but if I don't mention the ending to prepare you then you'll probably feel gobsmacked by it.  Tis dramatic.  Good for anybody who knows they like Joss Whedon stuff, or anybody who likes singing or independent movies that are witty in a non-pretentious way.  Besides, it's only 45 minutes of your time, although you might become obsessed with some of the individual songs and wish to watch them over and over again on youtube...
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this is a very cute app. my 1 and a half year old loved petting the horse. its kind of addicting!
B001I189MQ|5.0|I put off watching this for a long time because in general, I am not so okay with non-fantasy violence.  However, the more I saw the movie quoted online, the more I became impressed with the quality of the script, and for me good writing will excuse quite a few pencils in eyeballs.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is unusually well crafted for a superhero/ action movie:  I admire its restraint in not reveling in the violent aspects-- actually, it's pretty non-graphic-- and I appreciate its ability to convey intensity and emotion without an excessive amount of swearing.  It doesn't even treat us to a shoehorned in sex scene, because there isn't time to bring the action to a screeching halt.  Every scene moves the plot forward and honestly, for two and a half hours you barely notice the passage of time.<br /><br />I'm not going to carry on about Heath Ledger's Joker, because he did a brilliant job and we all know that already.  Nor am I going to criticize Christian Bale's acting, because he did a fine job-- Batman just isn't the standout character in this movie.  For me, at least, the movie is really about Harvey Dent, because it chronicles his rising influence in Gotham and his fall into despair and madness when he loses faith in the world and himself.  The Dark Knight is dense with philosophical talking points, but if I had to choose a main theme then I'd say it's about personal responsibility.  Batman doesn't have to answer to anyone but himself, so he can make the sacrifices and tough calls but there are some lines he will not cross.  Lt. Gordon is hampered by the rules of Gotham's police department and can't effectively combat an evil as chaotic as the Joker.  And Harvey Dent, after seeing the tragic outcome of everyone's muddled efforts, refuses to take responsibility for anything at all.  What ends up happening to Rachel could be all of their faults or out of their hands, and there's no way to be sure who should have done what.<br /><br />I haven't seen the other movies in the trilogy, and I'm not going to.  The Dark Knight is comprehensible to anyone with a basic understanding of the Batman mythos, or in other words to almost anybody anywhere.  Though incredibly dark in tone, the movie ends on sort of an idealistic note with the Joker's attempt to corrupt the people of Gotham being thwarted by the people themselves.  On the other hand, there's Harvey Dent.<br /><br />I have no idea what more I would need to say; to sum up, I was impressed.  I'm probably going to watch the movie again and then bug all my friends by talking about it for the next two weeks.  If you still haven't seen it, you should. This one stands up to the hype.
1451695195|2.0|It's a good book but I only gave it two stars because the author spends very little time describing the experience itself and way too much time analyzing it. He should have had a lot more to say about the experience after being in the coma for a week.<br />A much better book is Embraced by the Light by Betty Eadie.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This is a good movie even if you do not remember any of the original aliens movies. Still worth watching.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Very well done and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Would highly recommend this movie.  Denzel Washington was outstanding in this role.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Wasn't as funny as we thought it would be, but it wasn't bad either. It was alright. Yep. Yep. Yep.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'm giving it a 4 because I'm only doing this so I can get investment points<br />It's kinda sucks cause of the invest points if you don't have social media this game gonna be hard to get the Point
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great movie for men in black fans. Cast was great effects were great. All around awesome movie. We loved it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought this book had a great story line. It's well written. It has me wanting more of the story.
B00475BUVM|5.0|I bought this movie for my father and he loves the 3D on it. The content I think is alright but if you want action then this is the movie for you.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Good for any small business owner. Good quick read on the ever changing world of business. We use both of the author's products (Basecamp, Highrise) and love them both. Was great to read his insight.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Always liked this movie and it was even better in 3D. Now this movie was not originally intended as a 3D movie but there are some pretty good 3D graphics in it.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I had previously read the book and really enjoyed it.  The actors in the movie were great and the story was pretty close to the book.  Not really sure whether I liked the way the book turned out as compared to the movie.  I guess it will be a personal preference.
6304698690|5.0|I purchased this for my 8 & 9 year old grand-kids... Just and excellent movie!! Great kid movie!! FUN, Adorable and great<br />ending!! kids love that!! The Secret Garden, every library should have it!!
B005DOKIYG|5.0|It is easy to slip inside and out when I need to get to it. It also keeps it safe from scratching.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I was a little disappointed.  I love watching the &#34;Ellen Show&#34; so thought this book would be hilarious.  It was funny but just not what I expected I guess.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I came to love the characters, I cried and laughed, but I think one reading is enough sad thoughts for quite a while.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very entertaining. Nice graphics. Can't wait to try the sequel. Seemed a little short or maybe I just went through it quickly.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|That being said I found the last few chapters to drag on a bit. The characters were fun and I liked the dry sense of humor, anyone familiar with the type shows portrayed will find it worth reading.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|All 3! I wish there was more from Mr.Larson. The details and characters have depth that feed the imagination with potential
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first part of the book is a slog. I think I wanted to quit reading it 2-3 times, because of the superb writing of Gillian Flynn. You hate the characters, but that just means you're invested in them. Definitely a great read!!!!
0446310786|5.0|This particular edition was difficult to find, but arrived on time and just as advertized.  I could not be more pleased.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|This game suks becase when I play it it turns up side down and when it dose that I get very upset.<br />DO NOT GET THIS GAME WHEN YOU SEE IT
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's an ok game but not the best game ever. Wish the things wouldn't be as expensive as they are
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I enjoy watching the more modern Doctor Who series, and in this particular season, I just love the Dr.'s new companion Donna Noble.  If you like adventure and Sci-Fi accompanied with great actors, you'll enjoy this season of Dr. Who.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I started from the beginning and now we are waiting patiently on season 4. Come on season 4.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|hi my name is not malo I just like the name ans also im<br />scared to play this because I see people saying it has pron<br />ads?
B0010DGYJW|5.0|This is a must have if you like W.A.S.P. This has all the best of the early music. And is a real gem to have. 2 CD's. and nothing but music. Good, Hard, And Heavy. But don't forget the Ballads. Yes I recommend it.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My daughter loves this movie! She watches it at least once a day! The bonus is that it was $13 at Walmart. We got it for $5 and with our Amazon prime the shipping was free!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have passed over this book for months. The cover did not excite me, the sample I read just did not catch my attention, I just was not in the mood for a vampire-witch romance. What a mistake! This book is amazing, it is literary (almost a bit too much sometimes when the writer gets carried away with alchemy discussions), it has content. All books supposedly have content, but this one has stories upon stories and yet the main story is never overwhelmed. The characters are amazing and three-dimensional, not easy in a book with so many characters. The plot is original and pulls the reader into the story. It is a book the reader does not want to put down, but there is so much to contemplate that the reader has to take breaks. I found myself drinking large quantities of tea and wanting Em's cookies; I wanted to dance with Matthew, and visit Ysabeau and Marte in France. I completely bought into the lives of the characters and wanted to join them. Happily, the next book is out, and I am on my way to purchase it now. Don't make my mistake and wait, read it now.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|She is the most amazing thing to ever walk this earth. My favorite artist!!!!!!! Her lyrics are real and evoke emotion on so many levels.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fabulous book!!!!  I do not usually read Stephen King (too creepy), but this one was different and very well written. Loved it!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The same old Anastasia and the same old Christian grey. Interesting closure to a series. It gave you just enough to remember the characters, but in due to me you'll forget them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A very good one apart from popping up ads... no other problems:-) slow servers. Good graphics and good design. Sound effects are grea8 as if it is real..... .......
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars killed it again with his sophomore album.  The tracks are very eclectic while still retaining the Bruno Mars style
B008AYA7WE|5.0|I like play this games it made your mine work. I also have it on my PC  and I love it.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This is my favorite show! I love it and the entire cast, it is the best on tv!! LOVE IT!!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I play this game every night until I reach 3 star. I really enjoyed this game. I like to play Mahjong. It very relaxing and it made you used your brain.
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|Love PLL, they are awesome!!  I can't get enough of those girls, I am still reading the books also so its always a surprise ;)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A thrilling love story that will keep you on your toes but in the end it won't let you down.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Tried Temple Run 2.  Graphics were good, very exciting  lots of new thrills and bigger monkeys!  I can't play it because I have a fear of heights and every time the guy has to run along the cliff it gives me the heebee-geebee's.  LOL
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book appealed to all of my senses and emotions. It was so real. It was a pleasure reading this novel as I connected with all the characters. Simply masterfully written. I would recommend it anytime. It just reinforced that live has challenges but we have choices, stay down and defeated or rise and soar like an eagle. In the end we do make a choice that charts our lives.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy it because of the winning deal.  Very fun game.  I finally found a game that I am able to play at an easy pace.
0345803485|4.0|The book was just as described. I got the book pretty fast through the mail. It was a really good book.
B00009RDGA|5.0|This is on my 'Favorite Movies' list for sure!  Tatum O'Neal's  first movie and she totally owns it!  A must-have in any movie collection!
B005LAII3U|5.0|I was prepared to compare this with the previous Movie but can't do that.  This is a stand alone that was much, much better than I expected.  In my humble opinion, it would be worth the $15.00 or so I would pay at the Theater and is worth the money I paid for my own copy.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Good balance between action, story development, acting and remaining true to the legacy of Bond movies.  The message was timely.  Traditional solutions still work!
B004IK30S2|5.0|Good copy of the movie.  Very funny material and I'm not a real big fan of Will Ferrell.  But this is a pleasure to watch and particularly in high def.
B0000AUHPB|2.0|Sorry folks the original Italian Job was really sssslllloooowwww  and boring.<br />For once the re-make starring Donald Sutherland was heaps better.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|A truly wonderful look into the world of the art of creating &#34;world-class&#34; sushi.  Jiro's stern looks and his smiles are disarming
1452101426|5.0|Beautiful artwork. I love the paintings and concept work. I highly recommend for those who want to get an iside look to this beautiful film.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie given the critical reviews.  It is at least as good as identity and far superior to supremacy and ultimatum.
B00024I2Z4|1.0|Pretty sure this item is a fake. This is one of my favorite movies, and the quality of the film is alright but I'm almost positive it's a burned DVD with a printed sticker on top.
B0060D133E|5.0|I think my three year old and I really got excited about this one because there were humans in it.  And when they learned to fly, I saw some magic spark in her eyes, like it might really be possible.  That was lovely to see.  The fairies work as a team and that was also terrific.  But I want to know, why did the guy abandon his car in London?
B009APMNB0|4.0|Easy to use, super easy to understand and works. If only I could get a printer calibrator that works just as easily!
B009SCRERI|5.0|My daughter cannot get enough of this one.  Maybe it's because there is a hidden sibling out there.  Children relate to wanting to meet someone just like them, but different.  The magic of the snowy world gave an extra magical charge to this one, and there was more humor that my 3-year old could laugh with--even if it meant I had to explain the jokes?  What's a &#34;stealthy glacier, mama&#34;?
0811833887|5.0|Beautiful artwork. I love the paintings and concept work. I highly recommend for those who want to get an iside look to this beautiful film.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|When I first opened the app up I was so surprised no freezing.No nothing it was a regular. &quot;old app&quot;
0062238868|5.0|This book is an amazing look at the life of an everyday guy who happens to be an elite soldier and the most lethal U.S. sniper to date.  I wish I had gotten a chance to meet him in person.  It gives distinct recounts of a war I served in personally.  Further, his way of telling the story--as well as his wife's telling of the story--can relate to anyone.
B009O2XY12|4.0|very addicting, fast paced and fun i especially like that you can change the bubble colors i enjoy it very much
0529064847|3.0|This book when arrived at my door was beat up. the cover is all wrinckled and bent it is what i need for my classes but wish it was in better condition.
B008BZIUHG|5.0|I love the Rival Sons, and apparently this album isn't &#34;released&#34; in the US yet, so thanks Amazon for getting it to us sooner! Totally worth the $, Jay Buchanan's voice is spectacular and the rest of the guys are amazing musicians as well. I can't recommend this enough.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I enojoyed my pair of PX21's until the wire going into the volume box became messed up and I could no longer head any sound, and a few of my gaming buddies have had the same issue. The comfort level is decent but I prefer the style of the P11's (they however have the same wire issue.) This is a good headset for the price and the sound is great, however if you do purchase take extra care of the wires.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Ordered two days ago and here it is!  Brand new, was described as &#34;like new&#34;. I am very happy with this purchase.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Wonderful book that shows the frailty of people and what could happen t poo a person.  I loved the book and hope to see the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I for starters enjoyed the fact that there were NO commercials.  I had watched all 3 series in two weeks since I hadn't seen any of the episodes before.<br /><br />They were easy to download, the fact that you could pause them if necessary was nice and they all played well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It could have been a lovely love story except for all that kinky stuff.  Didn't even read all the chapters.  Went from Chapter 4 to Chapter 26.  Won't be buying the other books.  Can't understand what all the hoopla was about.
0375703764|1.0|Without a doubt, the worst book I ever read.  Just plain annoying.  I would rather go to lunch with a Kardashian than read another page of this wothless garbage.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is the freaking best game I have ever played. This is very creepy. On hard got 7 of the 8 notes this is very scary
B000R4SMCW|4.0|I had to wash it before it would play correctly. Then it was okay. There were lots of scratches though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book will keep you turning pages way past your bedtime.Trust me if your a big reader get this book
B0098VXE50|5.0|Well I was quite surprised that I actually enjoyed this movie as much as I did. The story wasn't to dreadful and the effects were actually decent. My favorite parts took place in the Faery Kingdom.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Great dictionary to help with homework<br />Love it<br />Love it<br />Love it<br />Love it<br />LOVE IT<br />HOMEWORK IS EASY<br />Look up a word there IT IS SIS
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Loved this Movie. The story was 1/2 way decent. I mean come on....President Lincoln a Vampire Hunter.....KickAss!!!!!<br />Enjoyable movie that will be watched many times.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|I love this movie it is so good I could watch it every day for the rest of my life.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Enjoyed listening to all the songs - stars are born with this show - I hope they keep going -
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Not as good as beautiful creatures but had more action and activity than the first book. Only took a few days to read cause I wanted to know where Lena was going and what sarafine\ Abraham were going to do when she got there. Very suspenseful and recommended reading
B00AFEXRME|5.0|DENZEL WASHINGTON WAS AMAZING IN THIS MOVIE. YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS SIDE OF DENZEL BEFORE EVER. HE'S ACTING WAS SO AMAZING THAT THIS MOVIE GET'S FOUR STAR'S**** HANDS DOWN. YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD TO OWN. IT'S SOOOO WORTH IT
B006MW3VGA|5.0|We love, love, love Downton Abbey here at my house.  I've been waiting for a show like this since Brideshead Revisited in the 80s. I must say, though, that Season 2 has its low moments.  Many reviewers have mentioned this, but in one episode a man shows up, covered in bandages, claiming to be the heir to the title.  THe absurd thing is that he speaks in a Canadian accent. Why, why why introduce such absurdities?<br />We also find NOTHING appealing about that character Branson.  Awful personality. And the actress who plays Sybill, despite being lovely, is NOT convincing as an aristocrat.  She has bad posture and a slumpy-faced expression. It's very uncouth.<br />None of this, however, will keep me from watching this show, and I give it five stars despite these flaws.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|The appealing young actress Jennifer Lawrence is on a roll lately, and if you happen to be one of her fans you'll probably want to see this movie for that reason alone. It's a legitimate reason, but there aren't a lot of others. Plot: Elisabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence rent a house at the end of a street next to a house where, we are told, two people were murdered by their own daughter. The teen son still lives there. Is he dangerous? And what happened to his sister? I prefer horror flicks without supernatural elements, so the fact this movie doesn't have them counts in its favor. The threats, real or perceived, are all-too-human. Nevertheless, the film is formulaic and never succeeds at being more than OK. Not bad, but just OK
B00957T6X6|5.0|I loved this bundle -- I could go from book to book and keep the characters and action straight.  Very good read if you like action, characters, and a little bit of fantasy and a LOT of intrigue.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|Oliver Tate's efforts to preserve his parents' marriage interfere with his efforts to win and keep his schoolmate Jordana as a girlfriend. He misjudges his priorities, sticks his nose where it doesn't belong, and fails to stick it where it does. Submarine is an off-beat and likable coming-of-age film about a very humanly flawed young man who, like most of us, doesn't always do the right thing and has to deal with the consequences.
B008B92U32|3.0|Don't really have much use for it, but it works fairly well and is fun. What else can I say. It works.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Harry Bosch novels all have the standard running themes (the damaged protagonist dealing with a dark, injurious past who is unable to commit to relationships, and a convoluted but opaque story line), but the style of writing is good enough to keep interest and this one had the &#34;black box&#34; concept throughout that was particularly interesting.  What is not to like about a good mystery told clearly and well?
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love this game. It is a real mystery and really fun. Most games like this just say find this or solve the mystery. In this game,you really have to think!
B004UFEJW6|5.0|It's been my favorite movie for a long time. I bought the Blu-Ray to see if it looked any better or different. It looks the same. The action is non stop and I watch it rooting for the underdog who kicks butt. If you like violent movies you should like this one.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love this new series. Different and enjoyable twist on an old theme. Look forward to each episode. Hope the series is renewed.
B001TWT0AE|4.0|Another favourite and very enjoyable movie.  Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon's entertainment to simply relax and enjoy.  Thank you.
B005HED08I|5.0|Watched this on internet enabled tv.....looked great.  Although the effects were a tad primitive, they were somewhat believable. The interplay between characters is what sets this apart from other series.  Will definitely watch more from otehr seasons.
B0001932ZA|5.0|My husband is a great Arnie fan and enjoys any of his movies.  This is just another example of another.
B0080MJYR0|3.0|This is a great movie for those experiencing cabin fever.  The special effects are primitive, but considering it was before cgi, they are amusing.  And don't worry, if you have to get up for a cup of coffee, you won't be missing much as far as the story line goes.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|A truly great and wonderful movie.  Another old favourite.  Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are both great in this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Seriously so addicted to this game.  It took me a while to not fall of the cliff and make a fast turn.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I admit, I'm an addict.  This series puts American TV to shame.  The acting, writing, costumes and scenery are sublime, and they keep me wishing that it would never end.  I hadn't seen Elizabeth McGovern since she was in her 20s.  Nice to see that this beautiful actress hasn't caved to the pressures of Hollywood, and has, so far, decided to age gracefully.  She is still stunning in her early 50s.  Maggie Smith is simply fantastic, as usual.  There is not a bad actor in the bunch.  I am pacing myself, as I want to savor every moment.  Well done!!
B003G94BZC|5.0|I'm old. I wanted to see what my grandson was so excited about. I was pleasantly surprised.  I have never seen the other incarnations of Dr. Who, but I really like this one.The show has interesting plots even though I am not a fan of time travel sci-fi. The production values were a lot better than I anticipated, though I had low expectations. The cast had a certain charisma. I highly recommend this show. Trust me. I'm the Doctor.
B00881VLCE|5.0|nice game love that you do not have to be connected to the Internet to play.  My children like the easy levels.  I love the amount of free puzzles too!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I actually enjoyed this story, which I thought was well written and paced. However, there were dozens of times I stumbled over typos and grammar mistakes that simply shouldn't be there. In this age of Word and other automated text editors, correcting the entire book would have taken me a half hour. Apparently nobody thought that was important before releasing this book. I would have given four stars for the content, but this got dragged down to a three by that shoddy attitude.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's like play a silly remake of Mario<br />Fun to play and my nephew enjoys it . As well as my neice
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I thought at first the book was non-fiction, but was let down when I began to see it was only fiction.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Good ending overall but it was easy to see coming. If you read the others, this will satisfy that need to know what happened feeling.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|Well-done film with redeeming qualities, though it takes a while to get there.  Seemed quite realistic, appreciated the change in Norton from staunch racist to a decent human being, all because of the humanity and unlikely friendship of a fellow prisoner.
B00A6RP8Z4|2.0|I was furious to find that the 2 bonus tracks are instrumental, and they sound computer-generated.  There is a bit of del Rey humming on one of them, and that's it.  What a fraudulent marketing scheme.  I don't know if she sanctioned this, but I doubt I'll every purchase a CD from her again.  The sounds on this CD simply weren't that compelling.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|A serial killer loose in a cruel communist society.  Keeps you intrigued from beginning to end and makes you wonder how people tolerated so much injustices.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway suffers series is one of the best games ive ever played its fun and it has a lot of skill.when I fist heard of subway surfers and I saw my friends playing it the game looked boring but when I downloaded the app for the first it was a fun experiance.Who ever wants a good fun and skilled game.I recommend subway surfers<br />I rate subway surfers surfers 5 stars:)
B00B7XGFO4|4.0|Although this \\"digitally remastered\\" video is of poor quality, this rendition of Jane Eyre is still one of the best made. Susannah York is bit too pretty for Jane but she deftly captures the character and brings the melancholy Jane to life. George C. Scott perfectly plays the tortured Mr. Rochester.  None have eclipsed his stellar performance. Add a haunting John Williams score and you have a blend that works beautifully together. It is just sad that the movie was not better preseved as it is a classic.  Well-worth the time, however, in spite of the poor quality.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All 3 of these movies could stand alone with their story and action.  My inital shippment was missing The Dark Night, but Amazon quickly replaced the set with a complete one.  Another must have for my movie colleciton!
B0086DBE62|3.0|Slow but cute little movie that takes a different twist on the typical Snow White story. The costumes and set are lavish and imaginative. A little silly in places but sweet and entertaining overall. Clean family viewing you don't see often enough.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is THE best super hero movie of all time!!!  I enjoyed most of the individual movies, but LOVE the heors all together!  This movie has a great story line, awesome action, and more comedic scenes than I expected.  AWESOME is all I can say!!
1616550414|5.0|I bought the Japanese version last year cause I didnt know whether the English version will be coming out or not, I was happy with the  the arts alone but I dont understand all the words. That said, I bought 2 copies of this book and I just received it today, to my surprise the size is bigger than the Japan version and the cover is better too! I'm aware people has already reviewed this book to the core so I would just write this review to say I'm very satisfied with this book!<br /><br />If you're Zelda fans I dont see any reason not to get this. Perhaps the timeline is the only one that hardcore fans will argue and always will no matter what. Sadly, the fact is there's contradiction but at the same time every game often shows connection with other games which causing the confusion. However if you disagree with the game creator then I have nothing more to say :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have enjoyed many hours of playing this game. I find the strategies a training of the mind to think ahead. This game is fun, entertaining and addictive!
B000P2A256|5.0|SAME JUST BOUGHT IT TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THEIR MUSIC BEFORE THEIR CONCERT  SOME OF THE SONGS I LIKED SOME IT DID NOT
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is probably the best documentary I've ever seen. Hard to believe that it's true - but it is. The soundtrack is amazing too!
B003MZ0I84|4.0|BOUGHT IT TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THEIR MUSIC BEFORE WE SAW THEM IN CONCERT SOME OF THE SONGS I LIKED SOME I DID NOT
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Now that I have my own copy of the first two seasons, I can watch them any time I need a fix.  Wonderful series!!!
B00004RJEG|5.0|SAW THEM LIVE ON VH1 LOVED THEM HAD TO HAVE ONE GREAT QUALITY SHOW MUSIC AND SOUND WERE REALLY GREAT
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I had every single minute back that was wasted on reading and skimming these books.  Very predictable characters.  The most fun I had was crawling through my dictionary on occasion with a new word thrown in.  If Ana blushes or feels the heat one more time, pray she goes up in flames.  One can only wish.
B003DT19F0|5.0|MY GRANDDAUGHTER ENJOYED HERS SO MUCH I ORDER THIS ONE AS A GIFT FOR MY BROTHERS STEP GRAND DAUGHTER TO ADD TO HER COLLECTION
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book will hold your interest.  As you read it, you can FEEL it.  Doesn't try to be too clever, just tells a good story.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|TRAIN IS MY FAVORITE ALL TIME GROUP.  LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM AND THIS CD AS AMAZING AS THESE GUYS ARE
1609611543|5.0|A radical idea, with a strongly presented argument.  It has caused me to change my diet.  The most life-impacting book I've read in a long time.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|awesome show glad I got to see it and using prime video was great in letting me watch it and the other seasons for free
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show gets better and better every season.  Somehow in one episode they can have you laughing and then crying your eyes out.  Love it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great program for so many uses.  I am just getting used to saving all my notes, web pages, articles, pics and more. All easy to search and tag from lap top, phone, tablet...so many possible uses for club, family, work, etc.  I will be able to read material and review anything using all my machines, such a practical format.  Love it.
0887431453|5.0|This book was just what I was looking for.  Have a 3 1/2 year old granddaughter who wants to &#34;learn&#34; so bad.  Started her on pages from this book and &#34;Wow&#34;, she doesn't want to stop her &#34;homework&#34;!
B005XN31LY|5.0|This is my favorit show. I can watch it all day long. I will probalby purchase the next series because I don't get time to watch the regularly scheduled show.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I liked the music in the movie so I knew I would like the audio CD. I listen to it in the car on my commute to work. It's pretty mellow.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|it is easy to use gust install it on a computer or laptop and sign in and it will work it is a good app
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The collection is great. Really beings you back into the story. Some music is missing due to time constraints. Otherwise a great CD.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Quite possibly the best season of Vampire Diaries so far.  The story arches this season were awesome.  The brothers are hot.  The originals are evil.
B00000JNNY|5.0|I hadn't heard of Etta James until a certain ventriloquist performed 'At Last' on America's Got Talent. Then I watched a movie about the recording studio that had signed her and other talents, sometime between jazz and Motown.<br />In between absorbing the sad history of stars who were cheated of their cut of the profits, and the pitfalls of drugs common to the heavy metal groups of my era, I was able to hear more Etta James.<br />I was hooked.<br />This CD seems to lack the quality recording sound those of us under 50 are accustomed to hearing, but, oh that voice!!<br />Etta James could have begun her career in any decade and still been a hit. Those of us who love her will strain our ears and close our eyes just to wonder what it would have been like to sit in arena sized concerts she never gave because her skin was too dark.
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|This is a quirky dance movie that still makes me laugh every time I watch it.  The dancing is quite enjoyable.  The acting and story are great.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|Not quite the page turner I was hoping for, a long drawn out build up to a pretty dissapointing conclusion.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This is one of my favorite versions of Sherlock.  Two amazing actors who play so well off of each other.
B0071NLG0W|5.0|I enjoyed the three Amber Fox books written by Sibel Hodge.  She (the author) is a witty writer and her characters are real and easily relateable.  Pure, light, fun, mysteries.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Hulk has the best parts in the whole movie.  Iron Man is quite awesome and hot.  Captain America is great.  One of my favorite Super Hero movies to date.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Customer service was EXCELLENT. Was super happy when they offered to replace the defective one. Now, let's just  hope this one lasts.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. For a long time I have been a fan of the musical adaptation, and decided to read the book. I was not disappointed. Though the lengthy descriptions of the bishop, Waterloo, and the sewers were hard to get through at times, but I still made it. The actual events of the story had me mesmerized and made up for the struggle of the slower parts. I would recommend this book to advanced readers that enjoy complex themes and have strong attachments to characters. (Eponine's death had me in tears) People looking for a book that is a long term commitment will love this masterpiece!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Not as great as the first three but still pretty good. It still leaves you wondering what could possibly happen next. It would have been better to be able to know what was happening to all the characters from the first three.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|I liked this movie, it was just a nice movie to enjoy.  I loved learning a little about this children's author.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app so realistic!the problem is sometimes its slow loading and when riding the horse,other than that this is a great app for horse lovers.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I was interested in The Grapes of Wrath after seeing a Ken Burns series on the Dust Bowl. Although a lot of people read it in high school, I never did. The book has such a rich vocabulary. Some parts are laugh out loud funny while others will make you<br />cry. The people are uneducated yet there is so much wisdom in what they say. I don’t think I have ever enjoyed a book this much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The solitaire version is easy to use without a lot of choices and useless customising. Once you play you will be sucked in for hours!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series is my newest obsession!!! I love it!!  So far, I enjoyed season 1 more than season 2. However, both are great and worth the watch!!
B0096A9QXC|3.0|the grand kids like this game but it get repetitive after a while need more to it than just changing colors
B000001GY9|5.0|The audio quality is sound alive, sharp a crisp. All the instruments come through, with no distortion or muffled sound as in some CDs of older works.
B007F1BQMS|5.0|I started watching this movie on New Year's Eve....then I had to go to work. I liked the movie so much that I bought it so I could finish watching it.
B0049985XW|5.0|l loved its one of my best with humphrey bogart,thats why a its a classic,no matter how far back it goes mr bogart<br />is still great he is my favorite,l try to gat is movies
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I love temple run 2 but it wont open anymore on my kindle fire... if they fix the glitches, yea ill be happy to play, but kindle fires don't cooperate well with this app
1400049628|3.0|Its an OK book. the encounters in the end of the book did not hold my interest. I read this to be a primer for WWZ but didn't need to.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|As described, fast delivery and great product.  Love the show and can't wait to watch.  Will be looking for season three
0307346617|4.0|Its a good book, Caught my attention and kept me interested all the way through. Not sure how this is going to work out as a movie though.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|FAST DELIVERY, AS DESCRIBED, GREAT PACKAGING.  MADE MY NEPHEW VERY HAPPY FOR CHRISTMAS.  PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW AUSTIN & ALLY, BUT MADE ONE LITTLE GUY'S DAY.
B000F90312|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack. It's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B004GYY714|5.0|I can  get all my favorite<br />music stations  Yes I would recommend this app.  It is easy to use and sounds great
B002GBOS7M|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack. It's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B00683JK9K|3.0|This is a great puzzle app and deserves 5 stars except for one major problem. It's iffy as to whether your progress will be saved if you exit with a puzzle partially completed. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't save the puzzle.
B000002OXT|5.0|This is an awesome soundtrack. It's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This is my fav show and this season was amazing.  Great shipper - no problems came on time - def reccommend it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This ap was so far off, not at all reliable for accurate weather. Deleted the application almost immediately. Not at all happy.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The season finale was over the top.  Will something bad happen each time a baby is born???  That was my last show regardless of how many seasons there are.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I could not put this book down. The title is misleading. there are no aliens. This is the story of an astronaut thought dead and abandoned on Mars. Think Robinson Crusoe meets McGuyver. The story is told through his daily log. His expertise and ingenuity help him through life and death situations. His sense of humor, some duct tape and some 70s TV help him to survive. Best book I've read in a long time. This one would make a great movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was not as good as The Hunger Games, but it ties in with the first book nicely. It was a swag book Yolo
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great read! Puts things in perspective if you knew you would not be here to raise your family. Makes this tragic story of abuse more meaningful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because of all the action in the games.  This book has a great storyline and plot to it. Yolo
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It gives accurate calculations for everyday calculations (i.e., checkbook balancing, rudimentary beat-the-calculator educational games, etc.). Overall, if you get it, you will probably have it on your device for the entire time it is used.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so addicting def need to download 5 starz this game iz hilarious esspecially the rio update
B009FZHYKU|5.0|That's the only word that comes to mind when dealing with The Walking Dead. Amazon makes it incredibly easy to view the latest episodes since I can't catch them on TV.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down. Highly recommended, a must read! I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I seriously couldn't put this book down! I loved reading every word and am excited to see the movie now!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was surprisingly better than I had expected it to be.  Normally I am not a fan of explicitly sexual literature, but the writing was believable and natural, and exceptionally hot.  I did have a bit of trouble accepting Ana`s naïveté... a college graduate that is a virgin, has never even really heard about anything relating to sex, and has never masturbated in the year 2011 is terribly unrealistic. The ending was non-existent, it appears that E L James got writer`s cramp and just quit writing. Possibly a ploy to sell a series of books, instead of just writing one, and generating more revenue???
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I LOVED IT,BUT I LOVE ALL DISNEY ANIMATED MOVIES ANY WAY. THE STORY LINE WAS BRILLANT. LONG JOHN WHO HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR THE BOY JIM HAWKINS. IT WAS WELL DONE.
B008Y78M60|1.0|I tried it several times and there was no sound available.  This had never happened before.  I may try it again some other day.
B0063IH60K|3.0|A fun app but the pop ups are most annoying. I guess \\"free\\" means free advertising for things you are not interested in and the game is interrupted with these pests after each deal.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I love Pinterst so this app allows you to fully enjoy what the site has to offer.
B00633W614|5.0|Written from the perspective of each character, the story is crafted so well that it kept me reading practically on the edge of my seat.  My only disappointment is that the 3rd book in the series is not out yet.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this book was just as good as Bared to You and I cant wait for #3. If your looking for a great read that you can't put down the Crossfire books are great!!!
0307887448|1.0|Not my cuppa. I wasn't even thrilled with the 80's pop/geek culture reference overload; it seemed extremely forced (even beyond the premise of the book) and like Cline was trying to see how much he could fit into the book, and that's coming from a geek child of the 80's. It's 300+ pages of fan-boy and self indulgence. There was almost no character development. All of the characters were clich&eacute;. What little plot and story there were tended to be rushed and buried between massive information dumps. It read more like a fandom message/discussion board rather than a cohesive book. Maybe Cline had not idea who his audience is. That would explain a lot. It took a lot of effort for me to NOT put this book down, never finishing it. I had to force myself to keep reading for the book club discussion. This had to be one of the worst reading experiences of my life.
B009DA74ES|5.0|All the seasons I've watched of Californications has been some of the best seasons I've ever watched. Hilarious, sexy and hott!! I recommend this season to anyone and everyone atleast18 years old and up!! :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Laughed and cried. Gave me chills and I couldn't put the book down. Highly recommended and one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books yet! (And I've read them all) ;)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is one of my favorite c.d.s. I listen to it all the time and never tire of it. They are an amazing group of talented men. They not only have original music but have put their own spin on others.A must have if you love music. It includes not only a little classical, a little modern, but even their own rendition of the Star Wars theme! Great fun.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Absolutely love it. It has me riveted  i find it hard to put it down . It is sooo interesting<br /><br />From Margo
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Love the cover and color.  Like the use of the stand when needed.  The leather is very soft to the touch.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I am currently reading this and I absolutely love this as well as the first one.  Great reading. Hard to put<br />Down. Have been late for work because of it lol<br /><br />From Margo
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I love how this game is really blocky and the characters are cute and the monsters are adorable, I just wish that there were more levels and more things to do once you finish the game. All you can do after defeating the chaos is fight against the lame low bosses and such.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Simply could NOT put it down. Bad thing is, I left other stuff undone! LOL. I recommend this book to people who want a book that makes them think. This is not  a sweet, shallow read. I loved it. Will definitely read more Gillian Flynn.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is so hard and makes me want to throw my Kindle Fire across the room, because it's that challenging. People that are good at puzzles would like this, and math also.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I could not put it down.  I still need to go back and re read the ending to be sure as to exactly who was responsible for the finality...however, I have sort of enjoyed not knowing for sure and just pondering on either possibility.  Great read!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like this game, except for when the dumb coins fall off the side. That sucks, and it really frustrates me that I can barely get any coins to fall off the front. Maybe that's just me and I suck at the game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A continuation of the first book but more exciting . Couldn't put it down, read it in two days and look forward to reading the third in the series.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My family and I thoroughly enjoyed watching Hotel Transylvania!  It was a great movie with a great cast!  I plan on purchasing the movie so we can enjoy watching it again!!!
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|It's the color that attracted my attention in the first place and I like the fact that it is cushioned on the inside to protect my Kindle Fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think very highly of this book. Some of the scenes upset me a little. How Ana handles certain situations makes me want go strangle her myself. I recommend this book to one of my best friends because we have the same taste in books. Some of the lines were overused.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This book was captivating from the first sentence.  I was rooting for William and his family the entire time.  Can't wait to see what he does in the future.
B001O03DPY|4.0|I came to bring the pain hardcore to the brain. The first one to drop a solo wu tang album its good though Meth vs Chef is my joint I give it a four stars.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|You see i used to ride before i got sick and this is as close as i can get to the real thing. Absolutely amazing
1607102110|5.0|The book was everything I expected, I received it in plastic wrap, the leather was the best. I was very excited when it arrived, I tore off the plastic and immediately started to read. I've always heard about Sherlock Holmes but never had a chance to read any of Conan Doyle's novels.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I thought it was spell binding one of the best series i have every seen. i love the interaction between characters
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is such a well done series;  I only wish there were more episodes. Looking forward to Season 3 and beyond!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|One off the best 3D movies I've ever seen. Special effects tastefully done without every scene having something flying out at you. The movie is addictive.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like it just fine. It's really just like any other solitaire game. Its a classic. It works great and I like the auto finish option.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game, especially if you like horses. I'm only to level 6, but there are enough New things for each level that keep it interesting.
B000HSKUBE|3.0|I try to stay away from very &#34;English&#34; stories because half the time I don't know what they are talking about -- sorry, that's just me...

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is amazing! I have to say the beginning is slow. But the book was really good! You have to read it!!!!!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|American Horror story has terrific writing, directing, acting, suspense and thriller/ horror elements. This isnt your typical slasher type series or movie for that matter. There is substance to the show, I usually take an eternity to watch a series, but I flew through American Horror Story in under a week, it was almost an addiction, I felt compelled to see what was next in the Harmon family saga. This is TV worth watching, if you want something outside of the norm, is deep enough for challenging your mind or if you simply want to turn off your brain and be shocked, this American Horror Story fulfills both! Yes America, its that good.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Can't wait to read the third book. First book was better, but this kept me reading and I'm buying the third book now!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Definitely how I thought it would turn out! Good, good, good! Wish there was more to the series! Left me wondering what will happen within their family life!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|A tired recycled drama about addiction. The side-serving of romance is a pointless dead-end. We see the debauchery before the flight, the flight and crash, the modest self-loathing and self-destruction, and denial, denial, denial. \\"Yawn\\" Better movies have been made about addiction, this one has a great soundtrack though, so it got 3 stars.<br /><br />Mediocre story telling. A tired, recycled plot about addiction starring, men, yet again. The usual female roles as love/sex interest, angry ex lover, and a sprinkling of female nudity for those who cannot watch a film about men without questioning their heterosexuality.<br /><br />The film doesn't ever feel deep or engrossing. While it is still watchable, that's all it really is. If you remove the soundtrack the movie loses a star.<br /><br />There is nothing new here. Nothing gritty or truly moving. I failed to ever feel much for the characters. It's truly just another recycled story, average plot, average directing and acting. After the taught flight/crash sequence the movie loses altitude quickly, pun intended.<br /><br />Watchable, but nothing you will miss if you pass on it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy a good soap opera, and this is a wonderfully set series!  My husband and I have watched 2 seasons in a little over a week, and will be so sad to catch up to the regular season and have to wait to watch the next episodes rather than doing it at our pace.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a great game on both the phone and the tablet we own.  Its the game the kids go to first.  It seems to have a slight glitch on the Nexus 7, but update may have fixed that.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Had a great story, very believable characters, enough drama and story, never skimmed a page. I highly recommend this book.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|i love vampire diaries and never miss it, love having the seasons to watch over and over.  very happy with season 3 vampire diaries
B00846F1YW|4.0|Fun to play and always a big different even in different &quot;rooms.&quot; I like that there is a variety of games. My only complaint is that when moving through the room you get penalized for random taps- that should be changed to only penalize when it's taps all over the place. But overall very enjoyable!
B008220C38|3.0|I loved the book - Anna Karenia by Leo Tolstoy.  It was rich with characters, sometimes, especially in beginning, hard to follow.  The book was wonderful, the  movie not so easy to follow.  Although it had the same basic love story, I found it difficult to follow being they came in and out of scenes thru a theatre stage.  It was nothing like I expected.  Sad love story of jealous behavior, takes place in Moscow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome!!!!!!!!! this game is so addicting you will never want to stop playing it. so if you like horses you should play this game.if you don't like horses you should still play this game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book ... tough to put it down for even a second!  Not a book you can second guess.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I caught a bit of Shawn Achor speaking on the local public television station during pledge time. I didn't watch because that just makes me crazy. But I did get the Kindle edition for my iPad and dove right in. Great stories. Easy to read. Sublime information. My only wish is that the recommended practices were summarized either at the end of the chapter (and easily bookmarked and/or jumped to) or summarized in an Appendix. I'm now in the process of re-reading to find and extract those practices so that I can incorporate them into my life.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This hidden object/puzzle app works well on my plain KF.  Just challenging enough for my taste.  I like that you can enlarge or narrow the view of the scenes if needed.  I would recommend.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I enjoy hidden object games but they often lack various things in the mobile realm. This one lacks nothing but length.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric is crankin' out the tunes and sounds in top form.  I love all the tunes.<br />The voice of Eric is one of the very best in rock.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Terrific movie.  There is nothing not to like about this film.  A wonderful character study into an interesting and troubled individual.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I've been a fan of the Doctor for years.  Christopher Eccleston is a great Doctor (the 9th to play the role, the first who was born after the series began and the first of the revived series).
1400064287|4.0|Very informative! I recommend this book to participants in my leadership program. It helps common people to understand why some ideas work and others that sound great don't pan out.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I got this game as a FAOTD, and have enjoyed it very much. I read some reviews that mentioned a few flaws, but I haven't had any problems so far. Overall, a great game.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is a very easy to use program and has a very good and wide selection of information. The definitions are good
B000HF6XPY|5.0|i would recommend this to anyone who has seen, wants to see, or add to their collection. cant really pass it up for the price.
B0089XH38M|5.0|This is a very good program. I use it on my home desk top and lap top. Would recommend it to anyone
B0040T7CFS|5.0|Like its record lable, this set is absolutely a brilliant classic. I say this mainly because of the superb quality of the cantata recordings. I got this today. I had been dreaming about purchasing the Harnoncourt Complete Cantatas set, but kept holding back because of the relatively high price. Before that, I had seen this BC complete Bach box, but I never even bothered to research about its reviews, because I thought it simply can't be good.<br /><br />Then I found out that the cantatas are done on period instruments by the Netherlands Bach Collegium with all male choir (same set up as the Harnoncourt), and I suddenly got interested. After seeing some successful reviews, I bought it and GUESS WHAT! The sound quality of the cantata recordings is crystal clear- you can even hear the noise of the wind players pressing the keys on their instruments! The recording engineering preserves incredible details of the sound under a nice atmosphere with a very nice balance of all performers. I was sitting there, astonished that Brilliant Classics could produce the sound quality at the standard of Harmonia Mundi!!! THEN, THE PERFORMANCE IS FIRST CLASS! The orchestra plays with most sensitive period style but with full-hearted passion! The interpretation of tempi, dynamics and articulation is right on. The choir is excellent as well- the voices eliminate vibrato most of the time, and the contrapuntal lines are very well heard. I extremely like the bright and well-done boys treble voice. The most amazing thing is the soprano solo, Ruth Holton. (As a cellist I performed the basso continuo of Cantata 51, which is for soprano solo, and was in love with this work ever since.) In Cantata 51, when I first heard her voice I thought, okay, they are using a boy for this one (because of the clarity and pureness of her voice), then I looked at the booklet information and was shocked that it is a woman. Ruth Holton's singing is effortless, and it is just so perfect for sacred music (nothing like those over-proud, heavy operatic voices). I can hear her sing for hours! Most importantly, the texture of her voice is something I have never heard before- bright, clear, pure, but at the same time strong and mature. IS THIS POSSIBLY HOW A CASTRATO WOULD HAVE SOUNDED BACK THEN?!?!?! In this respect, I find the authenticity of these cantata recordings to be un-matchable.<br /><br />I also sampled some other recordings including the Brandenburgs, the harpsichord concertos, violin concertos and the English Suite. Though the sound quality of the Brandenburg Concerti are not as good, they are great performances. Though not done on authentic instruments, the harpsichord concerti have the most brilliant Baroque style and liveliness. The only \\"poor\\" performance was the violin concerti, in which the performers played with rather heavy vibrato. But if you are not picky about HIP, you will nonetheless enjoy these very very much. The English Suite No. 2 in A Minor has been on of my favorite, and the performance, interpretation, sound quality are all excellent.<br /><br />Think about it my friend- these cantata recordings are absolutely on the same level as the Harnoncourt set, if not better. I doubt that set would have a better sound quality than this when they recorded the cantatas in the 70's. Imagine this Complete Bach set only had these 60 disks of Canatatas. Would you not still buy it with a big smile on your face at this price? Then, after enjoying these cantatas so much, you find yourself with another 100 CDs of the COMPLETE works of Bach, MOST of which are also excellent. Not to mention you are getting the complete sheet music scores on a DVD. Can you possibly have a reason not to buy this, if you adore the music of JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH?!
B0016NF06O|5.0|When you pair two fantastic musicians together(Willie Nelson/Wynton Marsallis).<br />What you get is Brilliant,Surprising,and wonderful lisenting.<br />Two different people, one great CD.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book came recommended to me by a friend.  I wasn't highly motivated to change my way of eating but I was open to the notion and suspected I needed to do something.  The book turned out to be a nice fit for me.  The focus is on eating healthy food that does good things for your body.  How can you argue with that?  The author adds enough scientific explanations and references without boring the average reader.  The writing style is witty and engaging.  So, after reading a few chapters, I found myself motivated to dive in and try a new way of looking at food by following their Whole30 plan.  I'm about three weeks into it and have been very satisfied with the results.  So in summary, the book is compelling and easy to read and the message is a good one.  Buy it, read it, do it!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Amazng recording. His story and life are so interesting and his music reflects his experiences! Will be getting others of his!

B005IQ39AY|3.0|I really like the game, but have trouble when a level ends.  I have to leave the game completely , then choose Bubbles Touch again in order to play again.  It would be nice if I could choose &#34;Play Game Again&#34; or something to that effect.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|Donald Fagan is the vocal half of Steeley Dan.<br />Seldom do you find an album that you love every song on it!  This is it.  Classic Steeley Dan,the lyrics,the outstanding musicians and the topical substance.  You want to understand every word.  He's an aging hippie but he's still got it!
B004AQR29C|4.0|action packed and better than I thought it would be, but a typcial Stallone movie. If you like Stallone you will like this one.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|GoodFellas follows Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) as he participates in the criminal activity of the Lucchese crime family, along with Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci), from 1955 to 1980. GoodFellas is a mesmerizing and epic crime film.<br /><br />The story in Goodfellas is mesmerizing, although you may have seen a similar structure in other gangster films. The story moves at a great pace, and gives just enough to keep you full despite the large period it goes over. There's action, drama, and comedy brilliantly blended into a film that demands your attention. The performances in this film are amazing; I loved both Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, but Joe Pesci really stole the film with his memorable performance (\\"Funny, how?\\") The soundtrack in this film was also great, and helped create the classic gangster atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall, Goodfellas is a spectacular crime drama; the settings, the performances, and the music all contribute to this film's authentic feel and demanding attitude. I highly recommend a purchase of this film.<br /><br />GoodFellas has strong violence and blood, and drug use.

B00B49L7Y4|5.0|I loved this movie. Even more than the music, which was fantastic, the story was inspiring. There were so many elements, it's hard to know where to begin, but largely this is about the choices we make in life and how we deal with adversity. There is a spiritual quality to it and, in the end, very emotionally uplifting.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|POOR QUALITY OF STEAMING TOWARDS THE END.I was looking for a good laugh.  All I found was a stupid movie that is degrading to women and has no real plot.  Do not waste your time or spend your money on this movie.  FURTHERMORE, i was disappointed by the quality  of this film.  Amazon usually delivers films with great clarity.  This movie &#34;TED&#34; near the end began very distorted and fuzzy.  the quality of the video streaming was very poor.

Oh, it is quite violent, so be prepared.

I've read this novel more times than I can count and it will never ever lose the emotional and academic force it's had on my life. A must-read for anyone interested in Japanese history (as well as the book describing the true journey), this book will remain a classic for all time-- I posthumously thank James Clavell for the wondrous adventure he has left behind.

B0024FADDI|1.0|This movie sucked.It was no where near as good as the first two Evil Dead films.The plot was very weak,the action was lame,the characters were boring,and worst of all,Ash hardly even used his chainsaw.Instead he made himself some stupid looking metal hand or something.Overall,I give this film a 1.They could have ended the trilogy alot better than this.
B0011BGY66|4.0|A great, high energy sort of music I can really enjoy.  &#34;World beats,&#34; as I heard somebody call it.  Interesting lyrics.  Young and fun.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a HUGE Bond fan. I bought the entire set on DVD a few years back, and I bought the Blu-ray set a few months ago. Bond really defined my childhood. The Bond of my childhood was Pierce Brosnan, and I really loved Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies. The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day are really lackluster. I have seen every single Bond movie. Some I have seen several times, but others I have only seen once. Sean Connery is my absolute favorite Bond of all time, followed by Daniel Craig. Lazenby comes 3rd, Dalton and Brosnan are tied for 4th, and Moore comes dead last.<br /><br />When I saw Casino Royale back in '06 all my doubts and fears about the character suffering a slow, bloated, and ridiculous death were assuaged. Daniel Craig revived Bond's deadly edge. He gave the character a sense of urgency that had not been present since Goldeneye. Casino Royale, as it were, breathed new life into Bond. Of course, I was really disappointed with Quantum of Solace. Quantum of Solace was bound to be a bit of a let down because it was following such a masterful reboot. But, I did not expect it to suck quite so much. It was disjointed and ridiculous at times. But, I still managed to enjoy it. It was a Bond movie treading new ground. Immediately picking up where the previous one left off. QoS had some flashes of brilliance hiding in the wreckage, but it was ultimately unsatisfying.<br /><br />Skyfall was really a make or break movie for Bond. I theorized that another bad movie would have sent Daniel Craig packing, and the entire series put on the drawing board again. It simply could not afford another misstep. Luckily, Skyfall knew EXACTLY which buttons to push. In essence, I believe that Skyfall managed to give Bond back some of his panache. Craigs' Bond had been pretty dry up until this point. Now he's in his final form. The entire movie is really about James Bond becoming the 007 we know and love. The final scene of the movie is absolutely invigorating. More than Casino Royale, that one scene gives Bond his deadly confidence back. I honestly cannot wait until the next one comes out.<br /><br />I only hope that this level of sophistication can be replicated for the next movie.<br /><br />Oh, and for owners of the Blu-Ray set. Remember that extra slot that was reserved for Skyfall? I feared that the Skyfall blu-ray would stick out like a sore thumb. I honestly thought that the blu-ray would have a different design than the rest. Luckily, it does not. It fits right it. The only thing is that they made the disc cover white instead of black, but it fits right in. I love it when they do fans a service like that.asino Royale, that one scene gives Bond his deadly confidence back.

B0081J9OWC|4.0|One of the best groups I've heard in a while, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros has heartfelt lyrics and a great musical style.  I am a fan of large groups, interesting lead voices, and strong feeling.
0439023483|5.0|This book was very good!  I left me wanting to read more, so I ordered the entire trilogy through Amazon! The book I received was in good condition as promised.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Angry ... frustrating ... and highly addictive. Exactly what you'd expect from Angry Birds with new scenery. (You know you want it.)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book, it was suspensful and the twist is great. The only thing I wasn't too happy about was the ending. But overall, a great read!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's free ... the music is soothing ... most of all, it's free.<br />It is a good game. I am sure there are better ones out there, but this is good for a bit of relaxation.
B009O07NMA|1.0|This is the worst album I have ever purchased....a total waste of money<br />Why am I required to say more
B00846F1YW|4.0|Fun game good graphics plays great on my gs3 people said some of the stuff is too far on the edge...not true if you zoom in
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love the challenges; find myself more successful at this game than with Free Cell.  I, agqin, spend too much time playing the game but depending upon my mood it can be challenging or calming.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|it was sorta cheesy just like the kevin bacon one. i would not watch it again . i did like that it went back to talk about why they banded music and dancing and it just teaches us dont mix church with government issues
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Best book I've read! I love it! I recommend this book to readers of all ages above about 10 years old.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|stephen lang is awesome i think he is thought of a under acheive actor he plays a good heavy in this movie good action. its better than arnolds conan
B004UIOUHC|4.0|Personally, I use Opera as my secondary browser on my computer and just like all the great features that the product has. When trying out the mobile version, you will notice that all of these features aren't there, however this is justifiable as the mobile devices are definitely not that powerful yet. However, stability is also a big thing for me. The browser on the desktop isn't the most stable in the world, and neither is this browser, so things just don't feel that natural. It has a look that you'll hate or love and is a great choice as a secondary or site browser. If you have Android 4.0 and up, just use Chrome as your default browser
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is an entertaining psychological thriller but not a major literary work. A fast read (short chapters/sections).  Try it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King shines again with this time traveler story.  He knows how to create those great scenes of the past, keeps the reader involved in the story.  His history knowledge of this event is also spot on, even to the locations.  Hard to put this down once you get into it.
1449410243|5.0|It's a gift and I'm sure she'll think it's funny.  Great gift for anyone who is a cat lover but thinks their cat is going to kill them.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I thought this was going to be another Moonlighting! I was wrong. The dialog is snappy, the msyteries are well done. The best part of the program is the characters. Watching Castle and Beckett come together was brilliant. Becketts relationship with her team is great. The best portrayals are of Castle's family. His mother is very well done. The top of the heap is Castle's daughter. Her relationship with her Dad is superbly handled. I own all five seasons. Well worth the money.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn were magnificent in this film.  They were both so talented and Audrey was so beautiful.  She was the only woman I ever watched in a movie and wished I could look like.  The singing and acting were superb.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|I think Helen Hunt is hot, so when my wife suggested watching this movie, I had a difficult time not acting too excited.  This was a great movie, an interesting story, and tastefully done!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love this app....I play it every chance I get! I even have my boyfriend addicted to it, it's very challenging to get all 3 stars
B005IF7HNA|5.0|I am glad I bought this series as I enjoyed it on TV and find it fun to revisit this science fiction macho world over and over.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Still an interesting read but it does become a numbers game.<br />More interesting is the conditioning or change that the fight of terrorism has had on young men...
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|This film is an OK but predictable thriller. The acting is adequate but the plot in this film is not very developed.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was the best book ever!!!!!!! It's a must Read book. Out of the series it is the best book ever!!
B009346RSS|1.0|We looked forward to getting this gadget and it sounded like exactly what we needed. It would have been, if it worked.  We set our system settings to PCM as directed in the instructions.  Unfortunately, it still did not give us any sound.  The power light was on so the unit was getting power, but it just didn't work. We returned it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great plotline, good mix of drama and action.  Definitely like the fact that the newer Bond movies are more cerebrial some of the previous Bonds.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|once again a great book a must read but I do think requiring a certain amount of words for a review will make me not review anymore
B00APJLEGA|4.0|Fun with my wife and kids, no one was disappointed.  The concept of that the humans scare the monsters gave my youngest a safe-fun time as well.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at times! But it is not soppy just a great read.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book.  I can hardly wait for the movie to come out.  I think this was one of my favorites from Nicholas Sparks
B0050KEVO6|4.0|This is a good app. Its very simple at first but theb becomes increasinly hard to find new combinations. The graphics are simple but effective. The controls are very intuative and there is plenty of settings to make it easier to play. Overall great app.
B00992CF6W|4.0|you should Do the villager update! it would make it so much more fun. i have it on xbox and its greqt
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This is a unique physics based puzzle game with very visual pleasing graphics. It is a nice twist on this genre. At 99 cents its a pretty good deal. It will keep you entertained for a while. I find this game to be pretty fun and addicting.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Truly a modern day horror flick to say the least. I was/am amazed at what is thrown into the show.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great Puzzle! Levels get harder, and smaller - This will be a challenge for some time to come. Very addictive.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|the story held my interest particularly since the use of drones and the control over this weapon is in the headlines along with cyber spying. good easy reading on a cold winter day.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love the game this game oh so oh very much... I could play ot all day long .... Thank you NER Brothers for creating this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its so well made bravo Iy'm glad its 3d this is the best horse game.but I do think that you should increase the coins you get or reduce item costs
B008MEM24S|3.0|It freezes my kindle all the time so don't get the game at all because it SUCKS and it is not like weres my water at all
B006X415GK|5.0|She loved this doll the most of the Monster High dolls she got this Christmas from us.  No doubt about it, the hair is kept in place, but can be combed out (as she proved).
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I can't really blame the actors... it's the script. While there were some moments, overall, the movie bored me and I LOVE the previous Bourne movies. It wasn't \\"bad\\" but it certainly wasn't \\"great\\".
B007712XAU|5.0|I received the DVDs in a timely manner and they were TOP Quality! Thanks for taking such care! I'm all caught up now on the series and passed these to my friends.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It is a complete set and he is ready to watch it where ever he is and as new, modern equipment is purchased.
1451673442|5.0|This book focuses in on a specific aspect of &#34;The Law of Attraction&#34; described in The Secret, namely how to use the law in conjunction with focused gratitude. If you liked the Secret, you will like this book. If you do not like the The Secret, and do not believe in The Law of Attraction, you may not like this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty good I mean it does have 101 games in it and u can redoubt games when everybody
B000002GB9|5.0|When you hear such  interesting and tonally powerful compositions it makes you a believer, not just in the power of music, but in the dignity of music. After falling into that awful monotony that comes from listening to nothing but heavy metal for a long time I gave Styx a chance on AXS TV. I was blown away by how interesting their song structures were, and how DEEP the lyrics are. This whole album is a testimony to the human imagination and the strength of rock n' roll.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a tale king weaves.  This book has everything.....intrigue, romance, history moral reflection.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a little escape.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I took advantage of a sale and don't regret it at all. Groundbreaking CGI with an awesome story premise make the JP series a must-have, especially on Blu Ray.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Very enjoyable; would recommend this book to any Grisham fan. Short stories still captivating.  It was great for our cruise.
B007L4HFDI|4.0|I always liked this superhero movie. I think this one raised the bar for the new crop of genre films we see today.
1589946006|5.0|A fun collectible for HP Lovecraft fans. Excellent for place-settings, library decorations, of general freak-outs! Well constructed and durable toys.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Just great and the 3d quality is the best I've experienced on my home set so far. Lots of extras too.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|One of the few superb romantic comedies that is not a &#34;chick flick&#34;. Instead of wallowing in sentiment it makes one both laugh and think, a rare quality in contemporary films. A brilliantly insightful work about the highest human emotion: 'love', not a tear-jerker about love lost or found.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This game is fairly easy to play. It has good graphics. My one complaint is on one level a hidden object is under the timer at the top and you can't get it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very user friendly app and easily downloaded and used by most android devices.  I can be used online or offline.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Good movie, definitely a departure from normal bond films. The first half is very bond-esque and then the departure comes fairly drastically.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game really plots the amazing in spider man!!!!!<br />But after I finished it reset my data. This is a must buy!!!!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I'm old enough to remember the hostage situation - the beginning of the 444 days of captivity of the \\"other\\" Americans who were unable to get out of the embassy - and how that situation was one of the causative elements that drove Jimmy Carter out of his Presidency, and Ronald Reagan in.<br /><br />And I, like most people on the planet, had never heard of the six who escaped.  Until now.<br /><br />I should alert you that while this is a thrilling movie, with tension you can cut like pieces of cake, it is not an action movie.  No car chases.  No precipitous cliffs.  No fisticuffs.  No sex.  Yet it will retain your attention as if all four were present, and much more.<br /><br />It's a dry production, with little fanfare, little glitz, and little showboating.  But it scores high on tension and focuses its energies on the realities of the situation, letting glances serve as bullets, and angry words serve as explosions.  You WILL be caught up in the tension and emotion by film's end.  And you'll laugh as well, when you least expect it.<br /><br />Part of the reason for the strengths in this film come from, of course, the actual situation.  One doesn't have to travel very far in time or location to picture a dense Muslim world with ugly Americans walking a tightrope in between our world and theirs.<br /><br />When a situation like this WAS foreign, in fact, was the 1970s, right before as all of this became everyday language to non political science majors.  To give you an idea, I was in London that very summer, in fact, in Hyde Park's \\"Speakers' Corner\\", when a group of angry protesters caught my eye.  They were marching within the park, gathering protesters by the minute, and I was fascinated by the situation.<br /><br />Being the optimistic airhead that I was, I walked over to the protesters to get a closer look.  I couldn't tell what their posters said, and even their flag--held with pride by several men and women--was foreign to me, so I began inspecting.<br /><br />BY the time I realized friends saw me, I puzzled over why they were so energetically waving at me and calling me over.  When I returned--to their relieved shouts--I began to realize it was my time to learn a little about the growing tension between our cultures.<br /><br />About this film: Not only is Affleck wonderful when it comes to directing this taut, suspenseful and economic thriller, but he is equally terrific as \\"exfiltration expert\\" Tony Mendez, the CIA man who came up with the daunting plan to fake a film project that was looking to shoot in Iran.  It was his job to import faked documents and distribute them, making sure to drill the six on the particulars of their new identity in order that not even the smallest mistake would befall them.<br /><br />Affleck supplies the movie with a steely resolve that typified what Mendez provided: for it was Mendez who was the backbone of the operation...it was his plan, his neck, his name, his character, his planning, that meant life or death to these six individuals.  His was not the only neck on the block, and those roles are also characterized well -- Bryan Cranston as his supervisor, Jack O'Donnell; Alan Arkin as film producer Lester Siegel; John Goodman as Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers; and rising star Scoot McNairy as Joe Stafford, the most vocal and skeptical member of the six Americans being rescued.  All of these roles -- and many others -- are handled skillfully.  They make it an intelligent -- and occasionally darkly funny -- escape movie.<br /><br />The movie has been nominated for scores of awards: it's up for seven Oscars, and has already won Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director at the Globes; it won Outstanding Cast Performance in  a Motion Picture as the 19th Screen Actors Guild Awards; and Best Film Best Edition, and Best Director at the British Academy Film Awards; and well over a dozen other awards by major film societies across the country.<br /><br />The movie came about after the information concerning the rescue became declassified, and in 2007 published an article entitled \\"How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick To Rescue Americans from Tehran.\\" for [[ASIN:B001U5SPME Wired (1-year auto-renewal)]] magazine.  (The rescue had, however, served as the plot to a 1981 TV movie.)  Having read the article, Ben Affleck, George Clooney, and Grant Heslov formed a production team and quickly snatched it up, securing distribution rights from Warner Brothers.  Shot for almost $45 million, it took in almost half of that on its opening weekend, and three times that as of the date of this review.ation concerning the rescue became declassified, and in 2007 published an article entitled \\"How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick To Rescue Americans from Tehran.\\" for [[ASIN:B001U5SPME Wired (1-year auto-renewal)]] magazine.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Kind of a dated story line since it is from an old book. However, it was enjoyable enough if  you go in expecting it to be an action flix
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting outlook from a neurosurgeon who didn't believe in \\"After Death Experiences\\" until he had one.  Without the scientific understanding of how a person without brain activity can have thoughts and feelings, he tries to explain what he went though.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I could not find myself caring about the lead characters. The story was predictable for an adult viewer. I could not really recommend it, which is unsual for me with a PIXAR movie.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie was very vulgar from the opening scene to the last word spoken.  I should have looked at the reviews.  If I had there is not anyway I would have wasted my money!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So happy to be a Prime member so that I could see the entire 2nd season wen I wanted to!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fun game, enjoy matching the animals for extra points.  I like the different patterns and it is just challenging enough without being frustrating.
B0000266T2|5.0|Great concert - great vocals - and great price.  You get exactly what you are promised... and you can't beat that!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest was a great end to the triligy.  Could not put it down till I finished so give yourself some free time to read it.
0345803485|5.0|i ordered for our womens group at church some came with the discussion starter dvd and the women enjoyed the sessions
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I bought this for my parents to convert the many neg. slides they have. Its so easy to use that even my mom didnt have any trouble with it!! We Have been able to see pictures I haven't seen in years! This is great!! Dealer is efficient and quick to serve. Would buy from again! Thanks! Awesome product!
0738735027|5.0|Great deck, well done and love the smaller size for carrying. Many people have asked where I got it from.
1439102813|5.0|Wonderful book which will give the reader a different prespective on Alzheimers.  A must read for any care giver of someone suffering from Alzheimers.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I doubt any further reviews are needed for this blockbuster! Love this movie, it has it all..action, humor, sci fi, betrayal, mythology, and plenty of eye candy - choose your hero!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|i really like this one.  Tom Cruise looks to be aging well and i like the plot and the action.  i am a sucker for action, guys are easy to please :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I recommend watching from the first episode, especially since seasons 1 & 2 are available on prime.  This is not your average TV drama.  It's about characters, a place, and a time; you get a real feeling for how life would have been for the people who lived and worked during this era.  A must see for those who love Jane Austen.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Just wondering when they are coming out with the next movie hehe.  Of the 3 in this trilogy, this is my son's favorite.
B004X75RK4|4.0|This movie is the perfect movie for a romantic night with your wife! While it is a chick flick and not filled with explosions and AK's, its still entertaining :D
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Basic speakerphone, but that's what I wanted. It does take voice commands if your phone supports it (mine does) so checking voicemail is as easy as saying &#34;call mail&#34;. It took me a long time to learn to program my password into the &#34;call mail&#34; but I finally did and it's great (after having the phone for 2 years). Microphone works well and speakers work well. All buttons are straightforward and do their jobs.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Like MW.  Accurate depiction of sniper training.  Would recommend for those who like gun movies.  Not for kids due to violence..
B000ARFNNM|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I couldn't wait for it to get here. Once it did get here, I was very disappointed. I have never had any issues with the sellers through amazon in the past and I have been buying movies from the sellers through amazon for many years. The movie I got was dirty, multiple spots on the case and the DVD itself what looked to be chocolate. The inside of the case was broken as well. After spending a fair amount of time cleaning the DVD and its case all I wanted was to watch it. I put it in my DVD player and it didn't even work. I was extremely frustrated and I was not impressed by this seller.
B008B8A9V8|3.0|I have looked through the print version of this book and thought it would be a good reference book to have on my Kindle Fire. A knitting reference book is not a book that one reads through from cover to cover and then puts on the shelf (physical or digital). It is not so easy to navigate through a digital reference book to find that perfect cast on or bind off for a project. The photos and text explanations are not as clear as I had hoped they would be. This is not a bad book, but think twice about purchasing the Kindle edition.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All three of my children cannot get enough of this game. They love it and play it the most out of all their games.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very raw and truthful book. I loved it, and will probably read it multiple times. True American hero that will be deeply missed. I feel honored just to read the book that he wrote.
159562015X|5.0|This is a resource that everyone needs to explore.  It provides a password to take a strength inventory on line.  It helps you to identify your personal strengths and shows you just how important these characteristics are.  It also gives specific ways to capitalize in using them ultimately resulting in improving your life and your work.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Tons of puzzles for free. If you like Angry Birds, no reason not to get it! Now, I'm no good at AB, for some reason, but good quality for a free game. Unobtrusive adds are a plus.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|My friend originally got me hooked on this show and it became an instant favorite. It is one of the most dark, suspenseful, and interesting shows I have ever seen. Every episode starts off with a flashback to a murder in the house and then fast forwards to present time. The story telling is unbelievable, and every episode you get a little more background into the big picture. It is definitely the type of show that if you miss one episode you will be lost and also a show where you will sit down and watch five episodes in a row because you'll be hooked. The ending is awesome and a big surprise! It is a shame that second season didn't even come close to meeting my expectations after first season, but I definitely recommend getting this to anyone looking to get caught up on an amazing show.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I love Mahjong but this was awful. I wanted to play a 3D version of game, but the controls just did not respond on the Kindle.
076115678X|5.0|I been hearing about the curly girl method and devachan for a long time but it wasn't  until I saw this girls hair on youtube that I realized I had to get the book. Its tell you everything you need to do to get beautiful,healthy hair. It even contains recipes to help your hair and &#34;how to&#34; dvd.
B005HSL626|5.0|Can't be beat for free, fun, fast game! I especially like that there are things to unlock, such as blades and backgrounds so you have a reason to keep playing.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I absolutely love and enjoy this movie, plus it arrived a day earlier than i had expected it too. Product was in great condition as well. I would recommend to anyone who wishes to buy this item.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I had a Puzzle Quest on the DS a few years back and played it to death. This, while extremely similar is slightly different. This is a great puzzle game where you match colored orbs, but that's not all. You actually play against NPCs on the same board. You gather colored orbs to power your special spell and abilities, dependent on your chosen class (sorcerer, warrior, assassin, etc) You can also win or buy (in game, not real $$) items such as weapons and armor.<br /><br />There are 250 rooms in the game, each with one or more battles to fight in each room.<br /><br />I can't say enough good about this game. It is WELL worth the money!!!! I love the unique format and the RPG elements.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Very powerful movie.  The wide screen format ensures that  i see what the director had in mind while filming this movie.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love, love, love, this app. One of my favorite things on my Kindle. Tons of sounds included, everything from fan blowing, light rain all the way up to heavy storm, thunder, railroad tracks, plane, cat purring (!), shower, wind chimes, various white noises, creeks, amazon jungle and my favorite, crickets. There are a few free downloadable sounds as well.<br /><br />I love that you can set up the sounds to run for either a certain number of hours or to turn off a set time. You can also have the sound just shut off or fade out. There is an alarm feature which you can set to any number of alarm sounds but also to any of the white noise sounds. The alarm can also be on or fade on.<br /><br />I am NOT a morning person and found myself waking up yelling at the alarm clock blaring at me so rudely and that is no way to start a day. With this, I hear a lovely fading in wind chime. It is a much more peaceful way to wake up.
0385344228|4.0|This is an un-put-downable book to the max. It is like nothing I have ever read. It deals with disturbing subjects and with Newtown,Conneticut tragedy fresh in mind, this was a bit disturbing read. Regardless, it's a fine book. It's not without flaws, somethings aren't really believable -- like how the parents never knew their own kid. The portrayal of Jacob is sketchy and it feels it was deliberately done that way. The twist at the end -- I did not see it coming like many others here -- feels cheap and leaves too many open threads. It is not a satisfying end. Regardless this is an enjoyable mystery.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|This would have been great if it had been an actual game and NOT a trial. A game should not be advertised as FREE game of the day if it is only a trial. Otherwise, this score would be much higher. Graphics are great, puzzles are fun w/out being too difficult, but atrocious voice acting, lol.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! So many twists and turns..excellent!! I've recommended it to all my friends that are readers and some have already purchased it! Well worth the buy!!
B00ATDOVNK|2.0|Got this as a FREE game of the day, which is misleading. This is only a trial. I will admit the graphics are gorgeous and the puzzles are great without making you want to pull out your hair. It is a BLATANT Bishock rip-off also. If this had a been an actual game and not a trial, this score would have been much higher.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie isn't gonna win any Oscars but it's probably the best action movie that's just fun to watch that I've seen in years. One of the very few movies that actually pulls off 3D off well.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|interesting, nice that you can buy episodes you missed during the current season. I recommend it to any who are interested.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Of course Cher is fabulous in Burlesque but Christina Aguilara is also very good. It moves fast and puts on a great show. Not too raunchy but more of an old school musical. Cher will always be a star.
B007LE2VDM|4.0|She is a fantastic singer and song writer.<br />Even better in concert than the recording is.<br />I recommend this album.
B000O174CM|5.0|The story of The Supremes. Well done and captures the 1960's and 1970's music perfectly. Jennifer Hudson became a star and won the Oscar doing this. One funny line was Jimmy,What does R&B mean? Rough and Black. You feel good at the end of this musical and that is what I like.
B007REV4YI|5.0|To keep this short and sweet...this movie has it all!! A great story, a great villan, great cinematography, and a great climax! You WON'T be disappointed! Also...the Blu-ray picture and sound quality are AMAZING!!!! Order it NOW!!!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Light hearted musical of ABBA songs put into a story of mother and daughter conflict. I loved it. Star Studded, but two supporting ladies were very funny, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Very highly reccommended.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app adorable my four year old loves it cant believe its actually free!! keep up the good work guys its awesome
B000W4KT64|5.0|A great teen age musical that really works. The 1962 period is captured perfectly with the fashions,hairdos,ans music. Queen Latifah is great as Motormouth Maybelle. Highly reccommended.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel couldn't save this one. Too much crude language , inuendo, and the old &#34;show a naked lady trick&#34; . I had 48 hours to watch it again. I knew it would be more painfull the second time. This one crashed and burned for me.
B0086700CM|4.0|My son and I have enjoyed playing this game over the past month or so.  The only thing i dont like about it is it doesnt keep track of your scores for you and for each player.  Other than that it has been an adictive game!
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so much fun and very relaxing. my  3 yr.old loves it and plays it all day long. Super game.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I like the idea of a new temple run but the way it works makes me feel sick while playing the game!  I start feeling nausious almost right away when trying to play it.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I've listened to this several times over, I love it.  Great songs, most of which I hadn't heard before.  Barbra picked the best singers to sing duets with.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|This movie is inspirational in a dark sense. It shows that when a man is committed to doing something nothing including a hooker can stand in his way! Great acting performances all the way around.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome. its a must buy,  it  has good graphics and it almost seems 3D to me, but i could be wrong. it has no glitches so it wont act up and not work or say it needs to be redownloaded
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was an amazing book! Can't wait for #3 to come out! I plan on reading them all again as soon as it is warm enough to sit on my deck with a glass of wine! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love this series!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everybody I know LOVES these series!!!  Am looking forward to next continuing series!  Thank you so much!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Another amazing book from Colleen! I never laughed so much & cried so much from one book! 2 more book coming out this summer & I can't wait!!!<br />Colleen Hoover is my most favorite author!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is like a brain stimulator. Its soooo fun fun fun. This game will get you going and thinking. It is pretty amazing
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I loved this movie and think its one of Washington's best performances. (Truthfully, I think its one of the best acting performances I've ever seen)  The movie is a psychological thriller with moral overtones.  On the other hand, it's a story about alcoholism and the capacity for human rationalization, ie denial.  Some found the ending trite.  I thought it was perfect.
083205416X|5.0|Steinbeck's style is magnificent. His characters tell a story that he cannot write explicitly, while he narrates a story that his characters cannot experience for the reader. This weaving communication allows the reader to imagine a greater context within which travel the Joads, Steinbeck's protagonist family. Switching back and forth from micro to macro lets us fully appreciate the horrors that accompany human mistrust and the beauty of its converse. The macro/micro distinction also reminds us that every social history is built on the back of many personal histories. They cannot be separated.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is a classic, of course. Like any good classic novel, its messages are timeless. A contemporary reader will learn as much about the human condition today as s/he did decades ago. Steinbeck's messages remain stark: trust your neighbor; give of yourself; rely on your family. He includes no \\"bad guys\\" because there are none. The bad we imagine is just a cumulative doubting of the good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had no expectation or even knowledge of this series.  I am a big fan of science fiction and mystery books.  The first volume frankly freaked me out, the description, images and introduction of characters had me hooked so very fast I couldn't continue on with the next volume as my heartbeat skyrocketed.<br /><br />What followed was several Volumes and pages of deeply satisfying character and story development.  I felt the claustrophobia of the citizens of the silo, the evil manipulation of their society and I won't go on so that I don't spoil it for you.<br /><br />These characters will be clear in your mind and you will be along side them during this story.<br /><br />Please, get this book!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I never needed a premium account, so this app works out great for school and personal projects. It never crashed me and works better for me than most note taking apps.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Good movie to use in elementary French class with worksheets. We watch it in 8 episodes.<br />No problemwith the shiipping
0439023491|4.0|I did not stop until I had read all three books in the saga.  Catching fire was not The Hunger Games (book one)  but it was almost as good.  I would recommend these books to anyone seeking adventure, and looking for a great heroine in their readings.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Fell short for me on the battle scene - was right out of Transformers. I expected to see Josh Duhamel at any moment. Overall, I still loved the movie.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These seem to be genuine Maxell batteries and therefore of good quality.  I bought a package of five on Amazon for what I would have paid for one in a store.  No complaints here.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|try to reloading the game on my kindle, still not function,were is the help ?? only the kindle malfunction ??
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This movie was great! Everybody should watch it. Even my husband liked it. The characters are great too. I would highly recommend it!
B003ZSI7R2|4.0|Saw a posting of the  Vintage Trouble where Ty Taylor goes into the audience and was wow as much as the audience was. I later saw a video of the group playing in a club in Venice Ca. Singing \\" With A Little Help From My Friends\\". Great job al la Joe Cocker.  Bought the Cd and was very pleased. Can't wait to see 'em live.
B002GAR3AM|5.0|I just recently found the show one afternoon on amazon and have seen seasons 2-6 haven't been able to rent season 1 yet. Anyway season 6 was an action packed season although it was short alot happened it kept me on the edge of my seat. This was an awesome season if you haven't seen it you should watch.........
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Who doesnt like Lucy or Russel?  I got 5 minutes into this movie and quit, cant do it.  Even DMX did a better job with Jet Li then this piece of crap
B0082Z1CVQ|1.0|i am yet to finish the book but is kind of boring to me. I am still reading it because when i start something i always want to finish it that is why i am still reading it otherwise i would have abandon it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a gripping read from start to finish! Could not put the book down! I would highly recommend it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My granddaughter can play this game for hours and will be very content.It is also teaching her hand movements and control that she would not learn watching TV
B003O86FMW|5.0|An excellent read that my daughter and I read together! My daughter read it for her accelerated reading points in school!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great version of an old favorite.  Just as addictive as Windows version. LOTS of choices of decks, tables etc. Easy to use and fun to play.  EDIT after having this game for about a month I'm pretty frustrated that I can't get my win percentage much over 11percent, nor my average time (regular scoring/draw 3)much under 1min 50secs.  I'm REALLY good at \\"e solitaire\\" but not this one so much!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Pros:<br />-Both the ceramic and carbide sharpeners work great, just as advertised<br />-Small; only ~3\\" long<br /><br />Misc.<br />-The plastic that makes up the majority of the sharpener seems so light that you might think it's bad quality, but it appears to hold together tightly and effectively.<br /><br />Summary:<br />A great inexpensive sharpener; low weight, effective, small and easy to use. I recommend it if you're looking for a sharpener! (I was referred to this by one of my own friends)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This App is the closest thing to owning your own horse I love all the tasks looking after my horse. Best horse App on Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|All I can say is this game is awesome but when you try to move the cartoon character once in a while it won't do what you want it to.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Challenging for the mind and spirit.  I also work crossword puzzles and find that it keeps you on your toes mentally to engage in thought provoking activities.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I keep deleting games from my Kindle cloud, as I really want to work on some art projects and read.  But, I happened to look at the free app of the day recently and got intrigued.  Now, I am glad that I did.  I have always enjoyed hidden objects games, and I find Mysteryville to be a good test for my memory.  Plus, I enjoy rearranging pieces of paper to recreate notes or glass shards to make a stained glass window.  The color in the graphics is crisp , and in short, this is a fun game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful plot that keeps you at the edge of your seat, very well done story line filled with drama and suspense.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a great I love it the horse look real life . there are lot of kind of horses
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I think it was one of the better Clancy novels especially of the last 3 or 4 years. I enjoyed once again how he is able to keep three or four story lines in motion. He also introduced a couple of new characters that will be probably found in his future novels, namely Jack Jrs. girlfriend and the CIA field agent in China.<br />  Clancy was in his element in this one which highlighted the real threat that China presents via it technological hacking ability. ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|1. After reading 15% of the book I was wondering if it is a business management guide? It wasn't.<br />2. Mumbling and whispering all thru the book. This pair must have wonderful hearing.<br />3. Still, a good romance<br />4. There isn't a real \\"ick factor\\" to the sex. With a couple of mild exceptions, it isn't anything most of us have done or would do if we could afford a frame to handcuff one another to.<br />5. The little balls were interesting, eh?<br />6. I enjoyed. I will wait a few weeks to see if I am interested in books 2 & 3.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Loved loved loved this book! I love one of the points this book makes, and that is once you say/do something you can never take it back. I remember high school very much as this book depicts it, a lot of gossip and rumors. And I feel Clay and Hannah's relationship is a lot like high school relationships, your usually afraid the other person doesn't like you back or your afraid to put yourself out there. This should be a requirement in all high schools!!!!
0545405777|5.0|I bought this for my husband to read after he got hooked on the movie.  After reading it, he bought the next book in the series.  There is no doubt the powerful messages of the story.  Katniss fails to understand the powerful influence she has over others throughout the story, as she faces challenges that she faces with a type of bravery and grace we all wish we could possess.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Picked this one up when it was the FAOTD so can't complain too much. It's your typical hidden object game. The dialogue is cheesy and there are numerous typos but overall it's a nice, easy,  and fun game to wind down with at the end of a long day.  Imho it's not worth 3 bucks because there is no replay value, 99 cents is more reasonable.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|I came into this expecting something mindblowing and conceptually aggressive.  Instead, its follows the \\"mystery solving boy\\" formula pretty closely. Its pretty over-the-top at times with action that bordered upon slapstick, and I had to remind myself more than once that its an adaptation of an old comic. Still, for all that, I found it to be enjoyable. It is visually impressive and the Amazon streaming treated it well.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|There is not much to say about this movie.  It's phenomenal. I enjoyed every minute of the movie and the graphics are great.  Great writing. Great acting.  Lot's of drama with plenty of comedic relief mixed in.  My wife and I only buy a dvd or two every couple of years.  I bought this one as soon as it came out.  Add this movie to your collection.
0064430227|5.0|Harold and the Purple Crayon?  I remember this book from my childhood and had to add it to my great niece's collection.  Shall I rave some more about Amazon Prime shipping?  Cause I can, you know.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is an awesome book! I read the sample and was hooked by the 4th page! I recommend for a lazy Sunday!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|If I could give this movie 10 stars, I would. This is one of the most gripping action movies I have ever seen. My wife and I watched it, then watched it over and over with friends. I highly recommend it. BTW, we watch any movie that is rated higher than PG on our Clearplay DVD player... which takes out bad language or nudity. We also highly recommend the Clearplay player.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this series of books, but I believe the series was written for a younger reader base. I am in my 50's
B007XAYKX8|5.0|The skills of these riders is simply amazing.  I watched this with a friend who was ambivalent about motorcycle racing.  He is now a fan.  Valentino Rossi, Jorge Lorenzo et al are very intelligent and describe their viewpoints very well considering English is not their first language (I hope).  The camera angles from various places on the bikes themselves makes for great fun.  If you like any kind of motorsports, you will enjoy this movie.  I own and have previously owned many sport bikes.  I thought that I was doing fairly well with them.  I now realize that I ride like a 90 year old in Florida compared to these athletes.
B000VYX8PE|1.0|I read the first few chapters and lost more interest the farther I read.... Not my cup of tea. The Bad Beginning, Middle and End
B009NQKXYK|1.0|This idea had so much going for it:  a prequel to Aliens plus throw in the origin of humans.  But the whole thing is messy, silly and basically ruins the whole Alien movie franchise.  It goes on so many directions -- most of them with dead ends.<br /><br />Visually it is spectacular, but the story and the execution is flawed on a grand scale.  Also, there isn't a single likeable character in the whole film.  Some are made out to be villains, but we don't know why.  The previous Alien movies all had very solid, very memorable characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was not sure how it would compare to the wonderful first season but Season two did not disappoint! I am obsessed with this show
B0011UJMK2|3.0|this book was boring at times.  in fact, i did not finish it.  regretted buying it, and would not buy more of this series.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I enjoyed the strange combination of early Americana, native American lore, Latter Day Saint stuff, and end of world threat (strange science.)  It took a while to make all the connections which made it interesting.  I am not LDS or native American but I liked the working out of the threats.  The ending is a real surprise and could feed the wild thinking of those who believe the government is corrupt.
B007PF7MGS|1.0|The author is a vegan and personally I don't agree with that way of eating.  Looking to sell his book like most turn-your-health-around book authors.  A high starch vegan diet isn't or everyone.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Title is a mis-lead.  Nice surprise. Hated for it to end, but love Grisham. Was my first book on Kindle.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I have sennheiser HD439 that I use with my iphone and this amp works great and makes my headphones sound amazing!
B00ANW33CM|5.0|VERY ADDICTING! I have enjoyed playing and look forward to many hours of fun! It's pretty mind boggling when it's in motion!
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Don't even waste your time. I'm the leader of my schools chess team, and this is just flat out crap. Easy is not easy, he always gives up(and by him I mean the bot )right<br />when you're about to win. This is a disgrace to chess and chess lovers
B0067Q04AM|5.0|The Robert Glasper Experiment hit a big-time home run with [[ASIN:B0067Q04AM Black Radio]], an album that fuses jazz, R&B/soul, and hip-hop. The Robert Glasper Experiment itself is comprised of Glasper (Rhodes, piano), Casey Benjamin (flute, sax, vocoder), Derrick Hodges (electric bass), and Chris Dave (drums). Glasper himself is hailed as one of today's preeminent jazz pianists, who also has a great love for urban music.  Glasper has toured with Maxwell and contributed keyboard work on Bilal's Grammy-nominated \\"All Matter\\", from album [[ASIN:B003U9O4H8 Airtight's Revenge]].  All said, every song on Black Radio, an album released just shy of a year ago, has a story, possesses abstractions, and experimental tendencies. A year after purchasing and listening gradually, if inconsistently, there is no question why Glasper easily locked up a Grammy win for Best R&B Album at the 55th Grammy Awards February 10th, 2013.<br /><br />\\"Lift Off/Mic Check\\" opens the effort playing up the jazz aspects, featuring angularity and changes of groove and time signature.  Shafiq Husayn provides narration, setting up the premise of the experimental effort.  The second half of the cut, \\"Mic Check\\", features Erykah Badu and the members of The Experiment testing the mic as suggested ahead of \\"Afro Blue\\". Why that's a big deal? The approach of the testing can be likened to jazz soloists shedding , which adds to the authenticity.<br /><br />\\"Afro Blue\\" features Erykah Badu in top form, honing in on her inner Billie Holiday.  Casey Benjamin's flute as well as Glasper's EP complements Badu superbly. On \\"Cherish The Day\\", guest Lalah Hathaway's rich, sultry alto captivates.  Throughout, Glasper accentuates the cut with thoughtful minimalistic lines and ideas on piano, while Benjamin compels on saxophone.  A neo-soul/hip-hop merge comes together on the exceptional \\"Always Shine\\" in which Lupe Fiasco easily spits atop an urban-jazz groove.  Bilal caps things off with his typical rich, soulful vocals on the hook.  As always, the Experiment holds things down, serving as both an excellent backdrop and as a creative force, be it Glasper's piano lines, Hodges's buttressing bass, or Dave's melodic treatment of drum set.<br /><br />On \\"Gonna Be Alright (F.T.B.)\\", Glasper takes a cut entitled \\"F.T.B.\\" from album [[ASIN:B000N8UY6Y In My Element]] and combines it with lyrics penned and sung by R&B standout Ledisi.  The results are smooth jazz and urban music at their finest, even garnering the track a Grammy nomination for R&B performance. King guests on the sensual \\"Move Love\\", featuring some distinguished piano improvisations by Glasper, particularly at the end as the cut fades. On \\"Ah Yeah\\", Glasper brings together two of R&B's finest in Musiq Soulchild and Chrisette Michele.  The chemistry, as expected, is simply ridiculous with Musiq honing in on his low register and Michelle sounding like a mix between Billie Holliday and Sarah Vaughn.  As always, Glasper lends his voice through excellent pianistic improvisations.<br /><br />\\"The Consequences of Jealousy\\" features Me'Shell Ndeg&eacute;ocello in arguably the effort's most alt-R&B contribution.  Dark and mysterious, \\"The Consequences of Jealousy\\" sounds very much like a tone poem towards the message suggested by its title.  \\"Why Do We Try\\" brings in Mint Condition's Stokely Williams, who doesn't dare disappoint vocally.  Even so, Casey Benjamin's vocoder might steal the show, collaborating alongside Williams capably.  Add adventurous playing by Glasper - displacing rhythms against the groove established by bass and drums - and you have a crowing achievement by all means.<br /><br />\\"Black Radio\\" may have a hard act to follow, but it does so capably.  Yasiin Bey (aka Mos Def) guests here both rapping and singing.  Mos Def is the perfect collaborator for Glasper and company, given his dabbling in jazz-rap and alt-rap in his storied past career. The final cuts are rock covers; \\"Letter to Hermione\\" (David Bowie) and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" (Nirvana).  Bilal guests on \\"Letter to Hermione\\" which features Casey Benjamin on flute.  Casey Benjamin takes the spotlight on the most unique cover of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" you may ever hear, using vocoder.<br /><br />Ultimately, [[ASIN:B0067Q04AM Black Radio]] is a masterpiece. The cast is well assembled and the musicianship is nothing short of both alluring and exceptional. There are no misses and no holes in this set. Had this album not been acknowledged at the Grammys, that would've been the travesty. 4 ½ enthusiastic stars.Like Teen Spirit\\" (Nirvana).

B007N8RULO|5.0|Wonderful game!!  This game can make a day of stress disappear.  All u think of is the next move to win the game.
0307120007|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who is 15 month old. She can easily open it and turn its pages. She is so attached to it . Everyday she explores a new page and that what makes it a brilliant book for kids
B0061QD7YS|5.0|Walt Disney classic! I bought this as a gift for my daughter, she loves it and it was a great price.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|At first I found the series too be mostly like a soap opera set in the middle ages, but as the series has continued, so has the depth of its characters. By the end of this book I found myself rooting for characters I would not have normally felt drawn to, but the more I learned, the more I found the lines blurring between wrong and right into this morally gray area. I'm definitely intrigued.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  Takes you into a different place in time.  Beautiful scenery and clothing.  It shows the differences between the family upstairs and the family downstairs and the troubles that each  face.  Once you start watching, you can't stop!!
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I enjoyed seeing Denzel Washington as the antagonist. It held me until they took him to trial, and by then I figured out there would be no twist ending. The acting was great. The cast was also top notch.  The plot of the film: lacking.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|very nicely done a good book even if it is a very hard subject.<br />I recomend it but everybody will like it.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I wish it had more levels. I enjoyed playing it but am on the second round of the levels. I liked it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Very predictable ,as most of his books are.<br />Easy read I read it in Mexico on my holiday<br />I recommend it to woman readers
B008HT4FUW|2.0|I bought this product (ASIN: B008HT4FUW) with great expectations; however, much more than mild disappointment set in soon after I began to view the first disc.  For what was promoted to be a Blu-ray version of the series, portions of the video content were not at all up to snuff -- frequently  lacking the clarity and crispness one would normally see in a true, high quality Blu-ray offering.  Moreover, I am virtually certain this product was substandard, as I had also just purchased the Downton Abbey Season 3 Blu-ray edition (ASIN: B0099Y2MYK), and it played on my BD player without exhibiting any similar video deficiency whatsoever. I contacted Amazon and registered my dissatisfaction, and they first offered a replacement.  They then quickly changed direction and offered a full refund (including return shipping), saying the product was not in stock and that I could re-order at a later time.  I have not made a firm decision about whether or not I will make another purchase of this particular item; what's to say there are not others lurking out there with the same issue?<br /><br />Further this is not the first time, I have encountered problems with Amazon-promoted video products.  Last year I order a set of \\"Little Dorrit\\" Blu-ray discs (ASIN:003QP2TYQ), which the Amazon web site clearly stated were playable in \\"All Regions.\\"  When I received the discs and attempted to play them on my BD player, I got nothing but a black screen, i.e., they would not play.  When I contacted Amazon about this product, they ran and hid behind the seller (it was an Amazon Marketplace transaction) and never did Amazon honor their \\"full satisfaction guarantee.\\"  When I contacted the vendor, they told me the discs were playable only in Region B (which does not include the US).  Accordingly, the UK-based marketplace vendor took the product back and refunded the just the price of the product. I had to bear the return shipping costs in full (nearly $10.00 (US)) and Amazon never did make good onits promise to reimburse me for return shipping in the event the vendor did not.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am more than a bit reluctant about ordering products from Amazon.  I feel one cannot take their representations at face value, and one cannot be sure that problems encountered will be consistently remedied to the buyer's full satisfaction.  Regrettably, Amazon did not handle customer satisfaction this shabbily in the past.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you haven't started watching this series, I urge you to start now. Love the storyline and the characters are very engaging. Feels like I know them all personally...love it!
B0000A14WB|1.0|In my opinion, there are very few good songs on this CD.  I have only used it a couple of times.  It is not worth using for a couple of good songs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this, you can accually interact and see your horse, and be able to do a lot of the things you can't in other games. My only issue was the nickname, because it kept saying invalid when I tried to change it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|for all the hype, this was a disappointing read.  Although I was curious about the outcome, it was not worth my time.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This season isn't as good as the others. For every awesome show, you're forced to sit through 3 really boring ones. Still love the show, but this season hasn't impressed me
B004XNGKBS|1.0|I hate this app. Not user friendly, no help or tutorial. Very hard to use.<br /> I want my $4 back!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Well the app has basic editing options and for the price I think its worth it, although if you 're not looking for limited options you should try something else.
B000VHKFIY|5.0|Very relaxing.  Loaded onto my mp3 and it lulls me to sleep @ night.  Sometimes when I wake up in middle of night, this puts me right back to sleep.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|It's challenging, fun and rewarding.  My neice recommended this game to me, and showed me how it's played. I would definitely recommend it to friends.
0765325950|3.0|If you read the rest then you might as well read this one, but don't expect much. The story is poorly written. Don't expect Jordan's masterful hand anywhere inside! What a disappointment this book turned out to be.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best and most fun game I ever played get this game this is so fun took will live taking care of dragons! Unlike tap dragon, this game gives opportunities to get gold you need for stuff and its optional to buy it this game is the best i suggest you get this game :) :) :) :) :) 5 smiles 5 stars

B0029SCFE0|5.0|The movie arrived in good condition and played flawlessly.  This is one of the best Drama/Horror movies from the Tartan Asian extreme collection. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, holding your mouth, looking away in shock, and cheering for the main character.

B0084TWN9K|1.0|As a regular reader of the short form this compares with the worst I've encountered.  Tedious, narcissistic characters in the hand of a self-indulgent and short-sighted writer.  These vignettes of the interior are tired and give women's lit a bad name.  I requested a refund.  If only I could get back these wasted minutes of my life.
B00A18KCSQ|2.0|Wow, I read great things about this album. What a disappointment. The only people who would enjoy this album are people that already like The Foals. If I had to describe this album with one word, it would be \\"YAWN\\".

B00846F1YW|4.0|This game was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the mystery as well as the different puzzles, searches, and games.  The flashlight scenes were really hard, but worth it.  I highly recommend this game.
B00846F1YW|5.0|enjoy all but word verse solves.  I enjoy this kind to searching for objects and a change to the mind.

B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Okay, I got all my friends to save their bottle and ended up meeting a wine distributor so was up to my head in bottles. Once you have the technique down this works......BUT it is so messy. So much prep time and clean up time and once you start you should plan on doing a lot of bottle because small batches are pointless with the mess involved.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|I have been using this case on my 7\\" Kindle Fire HD for a little over a month now. I didn't want to spend $40-50 on a cover, but still wanted great functionality and something that looked nice, not cheap. I ended up taking my Fire to Best Buy and trying every single case they had in stock at two different stores.  This was by far my favorite at any price point! I love how sleek it is and how securely it holds my tablet.  The four plastic clips do not intrude on any part of the screen and I really like that.  I would never buy one of those cases that have the elastic bands that stretch over the four corners of the tablet. However I do like the elastic band that holds the cover closed when not in use, and also secures the flap to the back while using it. I have my Fire oriented in the case with the camera on the left, power/volume on top, and charger to the right.  The sleep function works perfectly for me in this position and I like having the charger port exposed so it can charge with the cover closed.  The case is pretty light and is easy to hold for reading or game play in the portrait or landscape position.  The stand feature works great and because there are no grooves to match up you have more flexibility over the angle you choose to place it. I especially like that you do not have to unsnap the bottom two corners to use the stand.  It stays safe and secure in the frame at all times.  I have not had any problems with it slipping down once I set it where I want it.  I have read on other reviews that with the way I have my tablet oriented in the case that some applications will display upside down when using the stand.  So far all the apps, games, e-readers, and video sites I have used will rotate in either direction so this has not been an issue at all for me.  And if I do run into that problem, I can easily pop it out and reorient it.  In regard to the speakers, some of the cases I looked at had holes all the way through the back to allow sound to go through the case. I thought that might be the only flaw with this case because it did not have them.  Turns out it does not need them. Due to the plastic frame the Fire snaps into, the back of the tablet has 1/16\\" to 1/8\\" clearance from the back lining of the case. In addition, the speaker design curves around the edge of the tablet. Since the case doesn't touch or cover the speaker holes, the sound is not muffled or diminished in any way.  In summary, I think this is a fantastic case at a reasonable price.  It looks and feels great.  I particularly like the contrast of the textured and smooth \\"leather\\" on the cover.  It is available in several colors. I chose purple!  It has all the functionality and protection I needed for my Fire. I have already dropped it a few times with no consequence!  I highly recommend this case!  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I feel that the explanation of the book-which is printed at the end of the story-should be placed at the front of the book re: the story being based on actual experiences in industrial institutions. I felt that the strongest part of the book was the last quarter. I did like the way that the book was not written in chronological order, which lead to a more intresting revealing of events.
0812550706|4.0|Book was in very good shape ! The book itself wasnt one of my favorites but was an okay reading for those who like science fiction.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|I did not like the beginning of the movie where the first thing you saw was a boob and way, way to much skin. I could of done with out that part and the movie still would have been good. Not great, but good.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Entertaining. Tommy is a good actor and usually plays in good movies. This movie had good suspense and plenty of action.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was my favorite one I really hope there is another book very soon. I loved all the books!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The characters are well defined although the mysteries sometimes leave something to be desired.  The main character has changed along the way and is now much more aggressive and unpredictable than earlier.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a awesome game because it's epic fun cool and a bunch of things  so you should get this game it's sweet.
0316069434|3.0|This was a disappointment after the great books Connelly has written in the past.  There was pathos and grieving relatives and concerned co workers - with excellent memories of someone they hadn't seen for 20 years.  Come on, connelly, you can do better than that
B0052AC8C6|5.0|love love love this movie, i could watch it over and over. really great family movie and just so funny!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Another series I am hooked on.  It is also nice to get the gangsters out of Chicago into another ambience.  Actors are all excellent and if the action sometimes is rather hard to swallow - and to follow - I enjoyed it immensely.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|very good for this system. took me by surprise. have not found as good since d2 expansion on pc. its on heck of a time.
B00125WAWS|4.0|An unusual subject matter well developed and well placed in the context of its time.  Actors all excellent with special emphasis on Denzel Washington.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every song is one you will want to listen to again and again. Adele has done it again, following up her album, 19, with another great success.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book and this way of life has, as promised, turned my life in a new and wonderful direction, I ordered the book and had a consultation with Dallas, one of the authors. He answered all my questions about my cholesterol concerns, and countered all the myths I have long believed about the way I eat. I read this book frequently, use the recipes every week, and recommend it to all my friends, paleo or not. I like how they include the science but make it very accessible. The book is clearly very well-researched and Dallas and Melissa know their stuff. After months of following their suggestions and Crossfitting, I'm in much better shape than most 50 year olds I know, and I get to eat stuff like eggs, steak, sweet potatoes, avocados, olives...what's not to love? Bravo! More, please...and pass e mushrooms!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I hope it wins the academy award for best documentary.  Heart warming and great music. Interesting and true life story.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|I'm really not going to go into too much detail in this review, because most of you who might be reading this are probably at least familiar with Pink Floyd and how cool their music is.  (If you're not familiar with Pink Floyd, then there's something wrong with that...go and listen to them asap).  This album is a quality offering by Pink Floyd.  My wife had a copy at one point but something happened to it, and I'd ordered the Pink Floyd Discovery box set for her for Christmas...it was in great shape except the copy of The Division Bell did not work in it, so later I went ahead and ordered a copy of the Division Bell for her to replace it.  Good stuff!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I spent a long time playing this game.So fun!!!! A must get game!<br />You could get cut the rope experaments as well.Kids love it!
B0090SI42Y|3.0|I rented this movie day one, as I'd missed it in the theater, and it was a pretty entertaining watch...I'd even venture to buy it down the line for a reasonable used price perhaps.  It's not one I'd run out and buy brand new right away.  It's not a great movie, but it's pretty good.  It does pull some influence from old 70s Kung Fu films, and there's definitely Tarrantino influence in this as well.  All in all it's good, but I wouldn't hurry out and buy it up right away.  Russel Crow was by far my favorite character in the movie.  Do definitely check it out if you're into action & kung fu and a little bit of blood & guts, but I'd rent first before buying.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is a little harder then temple run 1 but it kind of gets boring after a while...its still fun though
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Knowing Quentin Tarrantino I knew this movie would probably be a bit brutal and bloody in parts and a bit racy, and boy was it ever!  But it was great!  A very well made and directed film, one of Tarrantino's best I'd venture to say, alongside Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds.  He is very keen on dialogue, and there's some great dialogue in this film, plus his love for spaghetti westerns definitely shows in this film.  I will likely buy this on day one!  To any of you Tarrantino fans out there or that like a really well made film and don't mind gore and racial stuff & a bit of brutality, then I highly recommend this film.  If you are sensitive to any of the following...racial issues, brutality, violence & gore, or strong language...then I suggest you avoid it.  Otherwise fellow movie lovers, I say watch it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy this show and am already looking forward to season 4. You can really get caught up in the characters of the show.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Good series.  A bit predictable but fun anyway.  The characters are well developed. The acting is good.  Special effects are good.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sometimes I am in the mood for something that twangs my heartstrings. Parts of this book are difficult as it is about a horrific story from the holocaust. It is a really well written piece of historical fiction. I feel like the message of compassion and remembrance is so important for the world we live in today.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I used google search board for a bit but just found it easier to use the [[ASIN:B00ATFVIQG google search unlocker]] for my Kindle.
0307454568|3.0|I don't understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this book. I enjoyed the first two in the series. Read them quickly and came away wanting more. But this one was a big miss.<br /><br />Larsson's first two books were both plot-based. Although Lisbeth is a strong character and we root for her, the books are primarily about the drama that comes through in the plot. She's almost killed many times, they have a romance, he's almost killed, etc. But this book had what I would call three moments of drama, followed by hundreds of pages of background and more or less boring police work. On top of that, the first moment of drama came out of nowhere and seemed out of place. There was no build up. It came and went in a few pages. The second piece could have been great, but it seemed somehow out of place, and the third you could see coming a mile away.<br /><br />I'm anxious to watch the film version of this because the first two were strong. That makes sense, given the great plots. But this one I anticipate being like a PBS special.<br /><br />If you've read the other two you have to read this, if only to bring closure. But temper your expectations.

B008YWY0HK|4.0|Extra crisp high resolution - almost too good. Good story line. Attention to detail (lighting, underside of horse's hooves, realistic movement of characters). Good depth of field in focusing. The &#34;right&#34; length. Equal respect for women and men in a historical context. Informative and entertaining. A good purchase.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it on the big screen!  I have the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; and it's so much easier to see.
0783225849|3.0|Psycho is so overpraised as the greatest horror film of all time that<br />it's hard to break the trend, but here goes. One obvious weakness is<br />the utter ridiculousness of Norman's insanity. I mean, come on! He<br />becomes his mother after he kills her? That would be the only case in<br />all of human history I believe. And the psychologist figures the whole<br />thing out after like 10 minutes with him?<br /><br />The other weaknesses concern the whole film prior to arrival at the<br />Bates Motel. We get a mediocre beginning with Janet Leigh and that guy<br />in the hotel room; I don't find her attractive--sorry. Why is it<br />exactly they were keeping the affair secret? Who knows and who cares.<br /><br />Then some rich Texan comes in, Hitch's non-actress daughter has the part<br />and says \\"I declare!\\" He says \\"I don't, that's how I get to keep it.\\"<br />Cheap dialogue really. Then Leigh steals the money and drives away,<br />then buys a new car which does nothing, but raise the suspicion of a<br />cop and car dealer? This film would be completely forgettable if not<br />for the great Anthony Perkins, the great film soundtrack, and a great<br />director.<br /><br />To drive my point home, imagine the film without the soundtrack and<br />cutting out the Anthony Perkins scenes. What have you got left:<br />mediocrity!

B0043JDUNS|5.0|My favorite part of the movie centers around Tony Stark's relationship with his dad and how many years after his passing, Tony is able to find and solve the puzzle his dad left for him.  I'm so glad Robert Downey Jr. came back strong in his acting career.  He plays a great &#34;narcissistic&#34; Tony Stark :)
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have all of Rod Stewart's remakes and love them all.  He can sing any song and it is beautiful.  The Christmas album is no exception.  I anxiously await all his music and purchase it immediately.  Guaranteed to please and bring a smile to your face.

B005LAIH54|5.0|I didn't get to see Wrath at the theater, and when it came out on the cable movie channels, it got one star, so I didn't rush to see it. I eventually watched it and have no idea why it only garnered one star. I give it five.<br /><br />Wrath has constant action and complicated relationships between characters playing out. The scenes of Perseus leaving to go fight Ares adeptly showed his justified fear; pain when the gods were being picked off and dying. The rise of Cronos, who was a marvel of cool graphics. The chimeras. Pegasus. The plot of Hades and Ares capturing Zeus to give his energy to Cronos, and the plight of Perseus and all around him trying to save the universe, were all superbly done, as least to me.<br /><br />I'll add this sequel to my library and forever shake my head wondering why some people thought it deserved less than 4-5 stars. I mean, what are they looking for that this movie doesn't have?
B000A6EXNO|5.0|very very goo..................d!!!! I'm very enjoy your  service and hight quality goods! many thanks!! I would order the other things soon!<br />your customer
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show! Can't get enough. Can't wait until Sunday for the next episode five stars!!!  Two thumbs up!  Love it!  Best.
B00192IV0O|4.0|I got into the Black Eyed Peas from hearing their music on the radio and on TV. As such, I'd largely heard the edited version. I knew there was some profanity, but I was still a little surprised at how much--not personally offensive to me, but probably not great music for a dance party with anyone over 30. Lots of songs with great beats. I could definitely have done with less self-indulgent yelling on the tracks, though.
1439190275|5.0|This was received in excellent condition.  It was great information for my husband to follow this program to help in reduction of carbohydrates.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this album. It's not happy music, it's definitely an album for crying to, but the writing is lyrical, and the music itself is well-crafted and beautiful. One of my favorite takes on folk-derived rock.
B00422LESO|5.0|I love the originality of this book, a contemporary novel with a Regency Era setting. Jane Hayes is a single graphic designer in her early 30s who hides a passion for all things Jane Austen related and dreams of being swept off her feet by a fictional heartthrob like Mr Darcy. However, she has a disastrous track record with the 13 boyfriends she's had during her life. Her Great Aunt Carolyn leaves her something unexpected in her will, a 3-week getaway at 'Pembrook Park', a very special function centre allowing guests to live in the year 1816 (except that it has a few comforts such as flush toilets and power points). Knowing full well that the gentlemen she'll encounter will be paid actors, Jane decides she'll go anyway, to get it all out of her system before settling down to a spinster's lifestyle. What happens to her at Pembrook Park had me riveted and frequently smiling.<br /><br />I loved Jane's inner processing of all that was going on, the acerbic wit of someone who's been disappointed in romance several times coupled with the genuine passion for all things Austen related. She really knows her Regency novels, which added to the pleasure of this book.<br /><br />The mystery and duplicity of some of the actors, coupled with the craziness of some of the other guests was great.<br /><br />As for the man she ends up with, WOW!. If this story was completely realistic, perhaps the fairy tale ending might not have happened for her, but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. A word of warning to those of us who, like Jane Hayes, may be trying to come to terms with the fact that no man can be everything wrapped in one package, you just want to hug him. In fact, I found myself worried that Jane, with her track record, might end up hurting Henry rather than vice versa. However, it's written in such a way that we trust she'll appreciate the value in him and make their fledgling romance a long-term, 'forever'relationship.<br /><br />If such a place as Pembrook Park really existed, I'd love to go there myself.existed, I'd love to go there myself.
B000002LND|4.0|I grew up listening to Madonna blaring from my older sister's room. I remember even early Madonna as being great music to dance to, but after relistening, I have to say, not so much. It's still fun, but at times repetitive, and most of the songs don't hold up as well as I would have expected.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Yay! Finally Ad free! Recent angry birds games have way too many ads. This has a fun theme. Must have game if you like angry birds and Rio.
B000H305U0|4.0|I got this CD almost entirely for SexyBack, and I regret nothing. It is exactly as much fun as I'd hoped. The music is charming, almost silly, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. A thoroughly fun piece of pop candy.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|A very unique take on teen super-power movies. The real world drama/reality of the story was refreshing in a genre that has been quite monotonous of late. Check this out! You won't be disappointed!!!

B00846F1YW|3.0|I enjoy hidden object games, and this one is ok for the most part. Problem is that each new level is the same basic idea as the last. No real change up on what you need to do, or different process to make it more challenging; just finding different objects.
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|Amazon app for tablet is great until you get ready to go to the shopping cart, then it tells you Amazon is not functioning.  I don't know if this is a glich in the app or a glich with the tablet.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|It came in on time. There were no scratches and it works perfectly. I would recamend this to others as well
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is a little different from past books I have read by Morton and while it was slightly different it still can be said that Morton is the master at creating a world full of rich detail. She is the master at crafting a story and place that feels so real you feel like you are there experiencing it for yourself. You can smell the air and see the colors of the lush world she has created and you feel like you have been transported back in time along with the characters as their story unfolds before you in a complex mystery that will keep you guessing and at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Dorothy was a complex character full of secrets, betrayal and heartache. A woman bent on revenge and also a woman with hidden depths that Laurel never knew existed. A loving mother and a woman with a secret past.<br /><br />I don't want to go into detail because really this is one story you must reveal for yourself. A story that you will get immersed into and be caught up in the storyline and lives of the characters.<br /><br />Morton can weave a tale like no other and truly should hold the title of a master story teller. Her stories are just as beautiful as they are heartbreaking.<br /><br />This is one book that you really need to savor and let all the details soak in as you are reading. It can't be rushed. So much is revealed that doesn't always make sense at first until it all starts to come together like only a master can do.<br /><br />As always with all of Morton's stories this was very well written and very well done. A story that will keep you curious and turning the pages.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|But is still an exceptional read.<br /><br />Yes, I admit that I found myself skimming over some of the more lengthy battles,  I hated that so many sympathic characters were killed off abruptly, and I could have wished for a nicer ending--but we don't always get what we want in life.  The series was wonderful and makes you wonder if this is where we're heading with some of our 'Reality' shows.....
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Lots of fun techy intrigue.  If you're into the wonders of our modern information age as well as discovering the mysteries of the past, you'll love this book.

No pressure then......<br /><br />I wouldn't go that far, but he's going to be a name to watch in the very near future. I wouldn't call this a &#34;blues album&#34; though, it's far more diverse. But that's where it works, Gary is playing to his strengths, and he has the lot: best comparison would be early Lenny Kravitz.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I was needing a new game, this was the wrong choice for me, I'm not into this type of game!<br />My 14 year old son on the other hand love it!!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|This is a good product but i found another one that I like better. This does not include a meter for battery strength.
B0049J0CTM|4.0|Great story for parents about letting your children go to experience life, success, failure on their own. My 6-yr-old was quite scared during several scenes...but he is pretty sensitive. Funny too!
B000SW16M6|5.0|Love this movie I always have. It brings back alot of memories of my high school years. Don't let the kids watch it though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband is just as addicted as I am.  We love the show.  It is well acted, great story lines and interesting to follow the relationship between the 1st floor and the 2nd floor.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Man this was so funny, I had tears rolling down my face while laughing. My whole family loves this movie. I even had my 19 yr. old bring over 2 friends to watch it a 2nd time. It really will be hard to top this movie. We find something new & funny every time we watch. I have to say that if a second movie comes out with Tucker & Dale together again. I will be first in line to get the CD. The way they left the end of this one it should be easy to carry on the story. Has some bloody spots but,<br />If you need a good laugh, then this is the one to watch.
