B005VCL4PW|3.0|I'm a huge huge fan of Meyer - I gave Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse five stars each and four stars to The Host. I had great expectations from Breaking Dawn; looking forward to an emotional, explosive and compelling read. What I got was a bland, boring and lengthy book.<br /><br />The marriage, the sex and the birth take up most of the book. The time Edward and Bella spend on the island does not bring across the romance as strongly as it was projected in Twilight. Jacob and Bella's relationship is not as interesting as it was in New Moon. The conflict between Edward and Jacob over Bella is suddenly non-existent (I was sickened when Edward asks Jake to share Bella with him, if she wanted a baby that badly. I mean is there no limit where sacrifice is concerned in Meyer's novels!!!). Also, Renesmee is born conveniently so Jake can imprint on her - regardless of how bizarre it would be when Bella / Edward / Jake might have explain all those kisses shared between Bella & Jake.<br /><br />It feels as if, after writing three mindblowing novels, Meyer had no more story to tell. Like her imagination has been exhausted or something - where this series is concerned at least. She was just burning up pages with mediocre scenes, lengthening the book unnecessarily. I truly believe she should've ended the book at Eclipse, with a more defined ending. This book belies all the previous notions that she ingrained in her readers - i.e. vampires are frozen in time and considered undead. So how does a male vampire produce sperm when his body can't even produce blood? This book is so distorted in fact that there is no longer any resemblance to the previous books. I did wonder quite a few times if it was actually written by SM or did they hire a ghostwriter to create this mess and asked SM to fill in the blanks?<br /><br />Once more thing I missed was Edward in this book. His role was sidelined and the old Edward was totally non-existent. Bella was no longer the same either - but maybe thatwas because she changed to vampire. Even Jake did not feel like Jake anymore!!! I could not relate to any of the characters in this book - maybe there was an invasion of the body snatchers from the Host in this book.<br /><br />I am sorely disappointed and disillusioned. All my wishes for a dynamic read have been crushed! In fact, I am upset with myself for even buying it in the first place. I know you'll buy it regardless of the reviews (like I did), if you're a diehard fan, but be prepared to be astonished - and not in a positive manner either.
098478280X|5.0|The title says it all - \\"Want to crack the coding interview.... Read this book!!!\\".<br /><br />I found this book to be extremely helpful in my preparations for tech. interviews. The best part about it is that one can apply the learning in day to day coding. I found the chapters on data structures, recursion, bit manipulation and, moderate and hard level problem solving  to be the really helpful.
006197806X|3.0|Pandemonium was one of the most eagerly awaited books for me for 2012, but it will be dishonest of me if I don't point out the negative.<br /><br />While Delirium kept me hooked from start to end, watching Lena change from an automaton spouting and adhering to the quotes from the Book of Shhhh to the fiery young girl who risked all for the boy she loved, Pandemonium only grabbed my attention about 60% of the time. I guess it was because the story was told in a \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\" format, switching between two different timelines of Lena's new life.<br /><br />Pandemonium starts off almost where Delirium left off - but told from separate POVs of Lena. On the one hand, we have \\"Now\\" where Lena is working for the resistance to bring the deliria-free society down. During a mission, she's kidnapped along with the son of the head of DFV (Julian) and both are kept imprisoned in the same cell.<br /><br />Julian is exactly what Lena was before she rebelled. He believes in the cure unequivocally and is ready to go through it, even if it means he might die since he has had brain surgeries for tumors in the past. What they go through together brings them closer than ever - and naturally, love blossoms. Lena is convinced that Alex is dead, so her falling for Julian is kind of unavoidable. We knew this was coming anyway...as soon as Julian is introduced in the book.<br /><br />In the \\"Then\\" part of the story, we find Lena on the other side of the border, lost and on the verge of death when she's saved by a group of Invalids. In this small group, she find a new home and a family she never had. This part of the book was dedicated to killing off people just to get some reaction or tears out of you. It didn't work much for me - I was hardly affected by the deaths as I skimmed through most of the \\"then\\" portion - and didn't miss much. It's never a good sign, skimming through a book.<br /><br />All in all, while I loved the \\"Now\\" parts of the book, the \\"Then\\" chapters just didn't hold appeal. I couldn't wait to skim through \\"Then\\" and just get to \\"Now\\". Anyhow, fans should definitely read it, if just to get to the end and start anticipating the next book. The end will leave you with a shocker (won't spoil it for you), and have you wondering what'll happen next!<br /><br />p.s. - Missed Hana & Grace & Alex!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it is not an opinion. it is a request. I live w the Kindle Fire. to capture and then organize thoughts is great. we already had Evernote on the IPhone but that was for groceries and general to do.  for my bigger picture, for instance goals, progress while contemplating and studying, I am using Evernote and would like it to stay in place while I move to other areas in the carousel.  thank y, Kindle
0880796863|4.0|The cards are awesome, but the book that explains them talks more about the history of Tarot cards then what the cards actually mean.  I went on youtube and watched a bunch of videos on how to interperate them.  I have also learnt that there is more then one way to interperate them.  So Yay, have fun figuring out how to read them.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I think this is a wonderful game for kids and adults alike who are interested in games where your main goal is to get as far as you can while still archiving different tasks you are charged with. the only criticism I have is that, once you know the course, a little of the challenge goes away. however, this is overrided by the completion and earning of new challenges, each harder than the last. overall, a very good game.
0060526491|5.0|Wonderful!  It got here on time, and my sister was speechless!  She loved it, and read it in about a day.<br /><br />Very, very happy!
B00005NWLO|4.0|Its a cool album to have. Its great because it has the original members of the band. They play Great in every song.I have there box set and it has about 5 songs from the album it seems they increased the crowd noise
B006JPS1OM|5.0|buy this app. I love all G5 hidden object games. there is a story line with each one. different from any other hidden object games. I have purchased all of the G5 hidden object games available. the only bad thing is there aren't 10 more for me to buy!!!  hurry G5, make more!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is a really good Bible. if you get this Bible,trust me you will love it! it really is the best bible you because it will talk to you. And because you can also change the version.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application has been so helpful to me in my quiet times and personal study of the Bible. I read it on kindle fire and have had no slow downs or other technical issues.
B0078N2MTE|3.0|It was ok, but I found the ending to be rather predictable and anti-climatic.  The story is good enough and it kept my interest, but I knew what was coming at the end and just kept watching, hoping for a surprise.  I was disappointed.  No surprise.  Exactly what I expected so just...meh.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This review is a technical review for two Harry Potter movies:  1)'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XHY) and 2) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XIS).<br /><br />For Deathly Hallows Part 1, the product details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is \\"2.40:1\\".  It is not.  According to the Internet Movie Database, the Aspect Ratio is 2.35:1.<br /><br />On backside of the DVD case for Part 1, it says, \\"WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.\\"  This is incorrect, thank goodness!<br /><br />The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an Aspect Ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!  Warner Video's use of the words \\"Enhanced for widescreen TVs\\" is probably their way of saying \\"anamorphic\\".  They should just say, \\"Anamorphic.\\"<br /><br />A true Letterboxed DVD of this movie would be a 1.33:1 image with a 2.35:1 widescreen image embedded and centered within it.  The movie would have black bars showing above and below.  It could be viewed on an older 1.33:1 TV without distortion.  It could also be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in 1.33:1 (Pillarboxed) Mode without distortion.  Or is could be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in Zoom Mode without horizontal or vertical distortion.  On a widescreen TV, in Full Mode, the image would be distorted and would appear stretched horizontally.<br /><br />Again, this DVD is in fact *not* Letterboxed.  If you watch this DVD on a 1.33:1 TV, the image is stretched vertically, hence it is anamorphic (which is good for those of us with widescreen TVs).  On a widescreen 1.77:1 TV, you need to watch the DVD in Full Mode to view the movie without distortion.  (Zoom Mode will not work well since the vertically stretched image will simply become bigger and remain vertically stretched.)<br /><br />For Deathly Hallows Part 2, the Product Details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is \\"1.77:1\\".  It is not!  The Internet Movie Database tells us that the movie is 2.35:1.<br /><br />On backside of the DVD case for Part 2, it says, \\"WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.\\"  Again, this is incorrect!<br /><br />The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!<br /><br />So, the good news is the DVDs are fine.  Amazon is a bit confused about the correct Aspect Ratios and Warner Video needs to learn the correct definition of 'Letterboxed'.

B004LWZW8S|4.0|The biggest mistake they made was marketing this movie like 300. This film moved on it's own steam in my opinion. Just like every other moviegoer that saw this, I thought it was supposed to be the next 300. Of course, this wasn't the case which left me midly dissappointed, however, it started to take on it's own shape. All the actors and actresses did a fine job. The interaction with the Gods was an amazing addition and was graphically stunning from beginning to end.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, see it. I feel it's worth it. Keep in mind, this movie is not like 300. If there's any relation to 300 it's by special effects only. If this movie was marketed as an original peace instead making it seem like it was \\"300 Part 2\\", I think the perception of it would have been different. It's a solid action/fantasy in it's own right.
0439023513|5.0|OMG!!!!!!!! First I have to say this is the best book in the trilogy!! The first one was a good start and the second one just seemed like a repeat with a few changes.<br />I had heard that this one was going to really make me mad so I'm thinking of everything that can go wrong through out it but nothing I thought of was what had happened. This last book I think is what made the series a pretty good one.<br />You will find a range of emotions as you read it, more so toward the ending. I don't know if I wanted to cry, laugh or or grab a bow myself.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|While the characters are talking rabbits, it deals with a lot more than your typical animal book. They are just the characters but the story itself goes well beyond that. It is a really good book and one that i will easily recommend to others.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the Bible in my phone and my Kindle Fire!  I have the Word if God with me where ever I am now!  Anytime I need some inspiration,  I have it!  Need to look up a scripture, I can.....anytime!  So thankful for the YouVersion Bible!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book! The writer is very precise and descriptive. The hunger games book flows well and leaves you wanting more. I could not put it down. The. Characters draws you in. Well written, captivating, and and riveting! The series is a trilogy, each book well written!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|An interesting storyline to follow between puzzles. Each puzzle must be completed before advancing to the next one but more of the story is revealed also.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|The movie is very entertaining. The only thing I don't like is the many different packaging of the movie. 2D DVD, Bluray, 3D Bluray, Digital Copy and so on. All for alot of dollars.  Why don't we get a nice Steelbook here in the US like in the Netherland, France, Germany? Should we all not buy the cheap standard packaging DVDs until the producers get the message? Standard Steelbook Hint, Hint.
0756404738|5.0|It makes you angry, it makes you laugh and sometimes fall in love too. It's the perfect sequel for The Name Of The Wind. Even though it's a long book, Patrick Rothfuss makes a terrific job submerging you into the world of Kvothe and the other characters. It is wonderfully written novel.
B00271DNP4|5.0|I enjoyed the 3rd book and the 3rd movie the most. Great directing. Great plot. Love the Whomping Willow scenes, and Ron's being squeamish. I love the 3 of them together, they have such good chemistry. Doesn't Snape's actor have cool serious eyes? I also enjoy watching Neville Longbottom's acting... Great music. Funny. I feel like the project (Book 3) ended up in a good team's hands. My favorite 3 places:<br /><br />#1: Ron telling Hermione that he will apologize to Crookshanks when he sees him next.<br />#2: Harry shouting out \\"Expecto Patronum!\\" when he's rescuing himself and Sirius - I rewinded 3 times just to hear him shout it. It's like perfect. Good job.<br />#3: Hermione asking if that's really what her hair looks like from the back. Gave me lots of giggles.<br /><br />Reading book 5 now. Still have some fun ahead of me ;)<br /><br />Peace!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love playing!  awesome for free! a+ challenging but not impossible to play. wish it held progress mid level. starts new in quest mode.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|If you begin to ever see behaviors among children as depicted in this film, then you are clearly witnessing the beginnings of widespread sociopathic behavior.  They may not understand the big words and terms such as eugenics, ethnic cleansing, nationalism, racism, et cetera, but this stark film is an outright alert.  Not to be missed among adults of conscience and concern for our future, however realistically painful it is.  The supreme art of film-making and black and white cinematography enhances the quiet historical drama that unfolds.  No wonder this was worthy of world-wide and Oscar award acclaim.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Fantastic headphones!  Pretty long so you can move around your office (unlike iphone headphones), and they're very comfortable over your ear and the sound/bass is amazing.  Also, no batteries needed!<br /><br />The only downside is, sometimes i get a tiny static shock.  If anyone figures out how to avoid this let me know.  These are NOT for noise canceling so these are not good headphones for the plane.  Thanks!

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I'm a starter with recording who uses this for voice, using a MXL 990 mic and a Monster Standard 100 cable. I haven't used any other audio interfaces before, so I can't really do a comparison, but as a starter, I enjoy this interface very much. First of all, the sound that comes out of it is very good for the price, but one of the things I love most about this interface is that it is extremely easy to use. The layout is very easy understand and everything is put together in a way that makes it very easy to operate. It's build quality is excellent and very solid, too.<br /><br />I use the 2i2 on MacOS Lion, and it works fine with GarageBand. Sometimes, although Garageband is able to detect the interface when I connect it, it doesn't always detect the mic so I have to restart my computer to have the mic work with Garageband. I'm not quite sure how to use the plug-ins included with the interface or the trial recording software, but it's not a particularly big problem for me.<br /><br />Some other interface options that seem really good that are in the same price range include the Presonus AudioBox USB and the M-Audio FastTrack. I haven't tried any of these, but from my research they both seem like alternate options, especially the Presonus.

B005LB1MY6|5.0|To call Justice the Juggernaut of electronica would not be an understatement. Seriously, they pound through catchy riffs like a skipping stone across an ocean - each ripple builds and collides to create one natural harmony after another. Despite having no live instruments, they sound closer to MGMT and Ratatat than their roots in French house. If Beethoven fought Chuck Norris, Justice would be the soundtrack. Justice's Audio Video Disco is a whirlwind blend of progressive rock, voicebox vocal harmonies reminiscent of Imogen Heap, and hard electronic dance.<br /><br />Horsepower revs motors in hyperspace the way Speed Racer chainsaws through ninja terrorists.<br />Civilization has the catchiest chorus and a 2001: A Space Odyssey inspired music video: [...].<br />Ohio teaches you Western American geography (from the French no less) with augmented ninth barbershop quartet vocal harmonies.<br />Parade would be right at home backing the final boss battle in a Final Fantasy game.<br />New Lands borrows the guitar rhythm from School of Rock and nearly forgets its dance floor calling as it enters pure progressive rock territory.<br />Then Helix reminds them, giving the disco in the title whole new meaning.<br /><br />This is my favorite dance album of the year. Now let's dance until we forget what era we live in.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|This version is a feast for the eyes. It's beautiful & glitzy.Had I never seen the London production,I would have really liked this version & given it 4/5 stars. But I saw the show 9 times in London, including the night it closed where Lord Lloyd-Webber proclaimed it, \\"the saddest night of my career.\\" You could immediately connect with the characters as they were played. Ben Lewis' Phantom is hard to like until he shows his more human side.He plays it as he was directed, as a very dark character. Anna O'Byrne, sings well but seemed a bit one dimensional.I saw the original cast headed by Ramin Karimloo & Sierra Boggess-the current stars of POTO 25th Anniversary. His Phantom picked up the character from where the original Phantom left off. There was never a doubt that they loved each other,or that she knew he was alive, but they made their choices long ago. Christine is very conflicted- wanting to stay true to her more loutish husband, Raoul, yet knowing the music completes her. \\"Beautiful,\\" Gustav's melody, was more entwined in the story & was impossible to get from my mind.I'd already heard the main songs & was startled & delighted by the London version of \\"The Beauty Underneath.\\" I still think this is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best score and I am delighted that they filmed it. I am just saddened they filmed the wrong one.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Just saw one of the two theater showings (Feb 28th) and will be at the second showing on March 7th.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Cannot wait for the DVD coming out May 29th, but enjoying the CDs in the meantime.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|This is not the 90s, but for the millenium this is a pretty good record. After about 5 songs the album seems repetitive. I can't listen to it straight through as all of the songs are ear-bleeding and there's not really much of a blend. I liked Foo's approach more on In Your Honor. This seems like a much less mature album.<br /><br />There are a few gems on here but for the most part they are stagnant songs that sound the same. However it won a Grammy and I can tell there was a lot of heart and soul put into this, so I'm giving it four stars.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Love Floyd.Have for 40+ years. But really , \\"The Wall\\" and I have had a love / hate relationship over the years. Many great , great moments but with some storyline filler......UNTIL THIS IMMERSION RELEASE !<br />I bought DSOTM and WYWH Immersion boxes , but was hesistant to take the plunge on \\"The Wall\\" because of what I stated above.Gosh , was I wrong !!!!<br />Discs 5 and 6 feature demos of both Roger Waters and band demos.<br />These are what changed my mind...Although the story is not sequentially correct on these discs , the assemblers chose to flow the cuts one into another.This is what makes them \\"extra special\\".<br />Look , I've been listening to music for 47 years , and I LOVE to hear demos and alternate versions of songs that are embedded in my brain.Discs 5 and 6 are what that is all about.<br />AND THE SOUND ON ALL DISCS IS FANTASTIC !!<br />I have a feeling that in the future when I want to be walled in I'll reach for these two discs , instead of the original or live version. To me , they are that unique and satisfying.<br />Thanks to everyone involved in bringing these Immersion releases to us. Now bring on Animals and Meddle  !!!!

0062073486|5.0|CLEVER -- I couldn't believe how well this book dragged me through it trying to figure out \\"who did it\\".  You will never guess!<br /><br />Luckily, you do find out at the very very very end.  What a ride.  One of the most clever murder mysteries I have read.
0691142165|5.0|The awards received by the book attest to the respect and influence it has gained in both academic and public circles. Some significant awards and recognition the authors have received since \\"This Time is Different's\\" publication include:<br /><br />(1) Reinhart and Rogofff, Gold Metal Winner, 2011 Council on Foreing Relations Award as best book on international relations.<br /><br />(2) Reinhart and Rogoff, winner of the 2010 TIAA-CREF Paul A. Samuelson Award.<br /><br />(3) Rogoff recognized by his peers in the Feb 10, 2011 issue of \\"The Economist\\" as being one of world's three most influential economists (along with Ragurham Rajan and Robert Schiller) in having \\"the most important ideas in a post-crisis world.\\"<br /><br />(4) Rogoff receipient of 2011 2011 Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics, Center for Financial Studies<br /><br />This is an important book for any one who wishes to be informed on current research in macroeconomics, the historical context of the current financial crisis, international aspects of global financial contagion or even the more interesting aspects of financial world history.<br /><br />Regarding world financial history, consider the story the authors tell (in Chapter 11) of King Dionysius of Syracuse in fourth Century B.C Greece. On threat of death, Dionysius orders his subjects to turn in all their one-drachma gold coins to be restamped as two-Drachma coins.  Now suppose you were one of those subjects, and turned in 100 gold coins.  After the King's currency debasement you only get back 50 of your gold coins, now stamped as two-drachma each, while Dionysius keeps the other 50 gold coins for himself.  Overnight prices double, and the value of your money is cut in half.  Once again the government has cheated you out of your hard earned money.<br /><br />Now is that so different than a modern government which allows its debt to explode and forces a massive expansion of the money supply which soon creates double digit inflation andcuts the value of your disposable income in half over a few years?  Such an event actually happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the US when double digit inflation outstripped the rise in income for most of the population.  We'd be foolish to think that double digit inflation or worse won't be the endgame to our current debt overhang problems (i.e. Rogoff in several interviews  has said he sees some inflation as part of the endgame for the US public debt problem).<br /><br />So if you're interested in what your country can do to recognize \\"this time is NOT different\\" and avoid such outcomes, you just might want to consider picking up a copy of this book and reading it.  It's certainly worth the time to check it out of the library just to read Chapter 11 for the humourous anecdotes on the history of currency debasement (i.e. to see for example why Henry VIII of England \\"should be as famous for clipping his Kingdom's coins as he was for chopping off the heads of its queens\\").<br /><br />For those who want a more serious discussion of financial crisis and their history, the book is a treasure trove for such scholarly interests. However, unlike many recent books on the \\"financial crisis,\\" Rogoff and Reinhart didn't start with a  self-serving agenda to make a quick buck by publishing a popular \\"expose\\" about the \\"great recession.\\"  So, with the possible exceptions of the clever Greek King Dionysius and a few other monarchs involved in currency debasement, you won't see them following the tired formula of assigning blame here to a cast of \\"evil\\" characters (i.e. bankers or politicians) and then coming up with a few popular \\"causes\\" and \\"solutions\\" to help sell books.  Instead, as professional economists, they set out long before the crises in 2003 on a difficult  academic study to collect and analyze the most massive and thorough data set on national debt and financial crises ever assembled -- covering a period of over 800 years in 66 countries (representing over90% of world GDP).<br /><br />The primary purpose of the research was to provide future scholars a framework to gain a more complete picture of the history of events leading up to and following financial crises, which they define into five categories (external debt, internal debt, banking, currency and inflation crises).  As such, they examine and compare the impact of financial crises on both advanced and developing economies, observing that while advanced economies have for the most part \\"graduated\\" from external debt default, they haven't found a solution to avoiding banking crisis (e.g. witness the 2008 US bank crisis or the 2010 to present ongoing European soverign debt crisis). Meanwhile, in addition to being threatened by the contagion of banking crisis from the advanced economies, many developing countries continue to be plagued by the threat of serial default, especially on external debt.<br /><br />As behooves an important academic study, the authors took what Robin Wells and Paul Krugman in their NYT book review called \\"a Sergeant Friday, just-the-facts-ma'am approach\\" so that \\"before (they) started theorizing (they took) a hard look (to see) what history tells us.\\"  As such, the book is refreshingly objective and non-partisan, and carefully avoids the temptation to give easy answers or jump to hasty conclusions.  For example, in chapter 10 on banking crisis (Page 146) the authors caution we should \\"not view their first pass at (this) long historical data set as definitive evidence of the causal effects of banking crisis.\\"<br /><br />However, while Reinhart and Rogoff were in the process of researching the book, the great recession of Dec 2007 to Jun 2009 (accompanied by the banking crisis of 2008) came along.  In observing this phenomenon which they coined the \\"great contraction,\\" the authors could not help but note that the events leading up to and following it were remarkably like those of \\"the big five\\" post WWII financial crises in other advanced economies (i.e. Finland 1991, Japan 1992, Norway 1987, Spain 1977 and Sweden 1991).<br /><br />The measurable events preceding these severe financial (banking) crises were:<br /><br />(1) large and sustained capital inflows from other nations (i.e. such as the large and surging trade deficits and current account deficits the US experienced prior to 2008),<br /><br />(2) inflated equity bubbles (i.e. as with the debt-fueled, unsustainable U.S. housing price bubble prior to 2008),<br /><br />(3) huge debt (public and/or private) surges (i.e. as with the huge surge in private and public debt in the US prior to 2008) and<br /><br />(4) slowing rates of annual GDP growth (i.e. as US GDP growth slowed significantly from 4.4% per annual growth in 2004 to 2% per annum in 2007).<br /><br />Two qualitative (i.e. not measurable) events preceding the more severe \\"big five\\" type financial (banking) crises were:<br /><br />(1) a \\"this time was different\\" attitude by public officials and \\"experts\\" that we were now in a unique or special position to avoid the disasters leading to past financial crises,<br /><br />(2) a period of financial deregulation preceded the massive private and public debt surges and asset price (e.g. housing) bubbles which led to the crises.<br /><br />In viewing the results of the \\"great contraction,\\" Rogoff observed in a number of public interviews (after the book's publication) the US was following the path of a garden variety severe post WWII financial banking crisis (\\"big five\\" type). The \\"great contraction\\" is to be sure not a second great depression, but it is more severe in its global impact and long-term persistence and slow recovery than any previous post WWII US recession.<br /><br />The aftermath of a typical \\"big five\\" type severe financial crisis, as we are now experiencing, \\"shares three broad characteristics:\\"<br /><br />(1) \\"Asset market collapses are deep and long, and don't typically recover until six years later.\\"  Typically housing pricesdecline 35% over a period of six years, and as of the end of Dec 2011 the US Case-Schiller housing index showed US housing prices down 33.8% from their pre-crisis peak.  Stock prices typically decline 56% over a downturn of three and a half years, and from Oct 9, 2007 to March 5, 2009 the S&P 500 index declined exactly 56%.<br /><br />(2) \\"The aftermath of such deep banking crises are associated with profound declines in output and employment.\\"  The unemployment peak of 10.1% in Oct 2009 has officially improved to 8.3% as of Jan 2012.  However, when you count the fact that 5.4 million discouraged job hunters have given up looking for work, the unemployment rate is really still at 9.9%.  Movover, by the US Burea of Labor Statistics data, when you consider those accepting part time jobs who are still looking for full time employment, the real under employed plus unemployed rate is now 15.1% (i.e. for Jan 2012).<br /><br />(3) As GDP declines, \\"government debt surges\\" to an average increase of 86 percent.  The 109% increase in  US federal debt held by the public from $5.1 Trillion in Dec 2007 to $10.7 Trillion in Feb 2012, according to Rogoff, is not out of line with this expected rate of increase.<br /><br />Rogoff and Reinhart have published a subsequent study (not part of the book) indicating that debt to GDP ratios in excess of 90% are problematic and likely to slow future economic and job growth. Reinhart has testified before the President's Bowles simpson commission about the need to get long term US debt under control. The commission responded favorably to her recommendations, and Rogoff has praised the warnings and recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission as \\"laudable.\\"<br /><br />The influence of this book, as well as the subsequent research of Rogoff and Reinhart on debt and economic growth in influencing public opinion and public policy in the US, should not be under estimated.  Despite the criticism of some respected neo-Keynsian economists that wecan afford to emulate Japan and throw caution to the wind in attempting another massive WWII-style deficit busting stimulus, the warning of Reinhart and Rogoff that we need a long term plan to begin to get our debt under control has become the majority view of the US electorate and their elected representatives in congress.  The difference between Democrats and Republicans in Washington is not over whether we need to get US public debt under 90% of GDP, but rather over how to accomplish it (i.e. raising taxes, cutting spending, or a combination of both) and how soon to begin the process (i.e. more than likely after the Nov 2012 elections).<br /><br />Other than being cautious with my investments in government debt, and being wary of the consequences of massive amounts of public and private debt on the markets, there is one significant lesson I will take from the book.  I, for one, won't be voting to elect any modern version of the Greek King Dionysius, who as a political leader only wants to spend government money like there is no tomorrow and make big deficits bigger, leaving no other option than for the central bankers (i.e. Federal Reserve) to inflate much of the debt away.  Such foolish public policy would dramatically cut the purchasing power of most workers, and especially those with fixed income and living on cash savings.  Indeed, by the time the politicians are done telling us \\"this time is different\\" we may be lucky to retain the 50 cents on the dollar (i.e. drachma) of puchasing power Dionysius afforded his subjects after he was done stealing (i.e. debasing) half of their gold coins
0345529057|4.0|When I ordered the 4 book series, I was pleased that there were several price options available.  Then after ordering, the books arrived within two weeks, quicker than I expected.  The quality of the paper is fairly low, but the print is clear and the size is comfortable for easy reading.  There's nothing like a hefty novel with actual pages to turn.<br /> Better than a Kendel.
1400069289|5.0|I generally don't like this kind of book - business oriented pop-science self-help blah blah. Really only Malcolm Gladwell hits these out of the park, and usually when you actually take apart his arguments they are garbage.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />I thought the power of habit did a great job of explaining the state of the art in the science of habits in layman's terms. I also found the book to be entertaining - each section has a set of stories that are woven together to make an overall point. The book suffers a bit from trying to consider absolutely everything that ever happened ever from the perspective of habit formation or habit change - but it's called the power of habit, so you really shouldn't be surprised that this is the case.<br /><br />References are surprisingly substantial for a book like this, and there's a process framework at the end that you can use to try and hack your own habits. Yay.<br /><br />Personally, I would prefer a book with more science and less anecdote, but they call those textbooks. If you read the blurb and think you're going to like this book, then you probably won't be disappointed.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I just saw the film version of LND in Kansas City. I must tell you I fell in love with the Phantom all over again. I enjoyed the music and the way music from the original POTO was found entwined with the LND music.<br />I have  question for the fans. Ar our screening last night, the musical scene with Meg and her troupe was tainted with some sound issues. We could not heard the troupe but Meg's voice was loud and clear. Did anyone else have this problem? I am hoping that this was only at our theater. I have not noticed anyone mentioning this issue in other comments or in reviews of the dvd. I am hoping this was only our theater's issue.<br />But even with this problem, I enjoyed the film tremendously. I have my dvd on preorder and can not wait to get it.

B0059XTUEK|5.0|I'm old enough to remember seeing most of Marilyn Monroe's films on the big screen when they were released. And I'm sure I had her pinup somewhere in my room. I'm sorry she never finished her last film \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" but, as I was watching Michelle Williams in the new film, I felt I was seeing a \\"New\\" Marilyn film. Williams was perfect casting. And I had never seen her before. I missed \\"Blue Valentine\\". She really channels Monroe and is both sexy and introspective.<br /><br />As you have probably read - I won't go over the plot again, as others have surely done that here - the film is based on Colin Clark's journal about the week he spent on the set of the film that eventually became \\"The Prince and The Showgirl\\". I can't think of a male over age 18 that won't think - while watching this film - \\"Wow! If only I was in Clark's position!\\" And I'm sure many will dream of that! Honestly, I  can't say how this plays out from the point of the female viewer.<br /><br />No this is not an \\"epic\\" film but rather the kind of small \\"Quality\\" films that the Weinstein Company finds and releases. (Just look at \\"The Artist\\", \\"The Descendants\\" and \\"The Iron Lady\\"; all with superb casting and lots of Oscar noms.). And for that I can recommend it highly. It's not long - at just 99 minutes.<br /><br />Both the DVD and the Blu-ray have the same bonus features. These include a full length commentary by Director Simon Curtis as well as a 19-minute \\" The Untold Story of An American Icon\\", which is the now-typical \\"making of\\" featurette which mixes comments from the cast and production crew with scenes from the film. There a few actually newsreels clips of Monroe included, but not enough to mention. And there is nothing included putting this \\"week of filming in England\\" into perspective with the rest of Monroe's career or the culture of the times. A short documentary on Monroe would have added greatly to the experience for viewers who were not alive during Monroe's life.<br /><br />My five-stars are based on the film itself, as I want to encourage others to see it. But if I had to rare the package as a whole it would be 4 stars.<br /><br />I hope you found this information both helpful and informative<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\">My five-stars are based on the film itself, as I want to encourage others to see it.

B00002N9ER|5.0|I used these brackets in the existing threaded holes of my BMW E90 trunk lid. The holes are for a reflective emergency triangle that did not come with my car. The spacing (using only one of the 2 holes in each bracket) is perfect for a 3 D-Cell Maglite. I even used the screws that came with the kit (although I'll probably swap them for the proper thread bolt in BLACK to clean it up a bit. These brackets have just the right amount of grip and even a hard slam of the trunk lid does not dislodge the fairly heavy flashlight. The impression in the trunk lid will probably accomodate a 4 or 5 D-Cell light if such a beast exists.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|Leonardo DiCaprio, who portrayed Howard Hughes in \\"The Aviator,\\" plays once again one of the most enigmatic figures in American history: John Edgar Hoover, the first director of FBI. This time the film is written by Dustin Lance Black (Oscar winner for \\"Milk\\") and directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the most respected film directors living today. Despite his assured direction and the impressive production designs, however, \\"J. Edgar\\" is a missed opportunity for a more insightful drama about the man who reigned over the bureau (if you count the Bureau of Investigation preceding FBI) nearly half a century.<br /><br />\\"J. Edgar\\" starts with Hoover in the early 1960s, dictating the early history of FBI to a writer. He recounts how everything started back in 1919, when Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer was nearly killed by a bomb attack. Then the film moves back and forth between the two times, each of which represents two different phases of the man's life.<br /><br />I see the point the filmmakers are trying to make, but the film's too complicated narrative structure does not help in telling the important incidents (like the Lindbergh kidnapping), which are frequently interrupted without any good reasons. As to the relationship between Hoover and Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), not much is very interesting, as the latter as a character is not fully fleshed-out. The same can be said about his secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts), and his mother Anna Marie (Judi Dench).<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio (nominated for Golden Globe but ignored by Academy Award) delivers a solid performance, but his portrayal of the aged Hoover, in spite of the special aging make-up, doesn't convince. His acting is strong, but somehow I just couldn't shake off the feeling that he is acting under the heavy mask. All in all \\"J. Edgar\\" is a decent biographical drama, but needs more time and more effective narrative to tell his story.

Yeah, these films have been pretty much done to death these days, but there's something about this one, which makes it feel fresh. The story follows only a few characters throughout the film, which allows us to fully understand each of their plights. Whether it's Matt Damon's character attempting to protect her daughter, or Laurence Fishburne searching for a cure, the intertwining stories are well done. The cinematography is fantastic and the lighting and composition of frames are exquisite, the work of an excellent director. The film has no action per se, the pacing kind of maintains a flat line (i.e. there's no scenes of a large virus cloud chasing Matt Damon ), but for the subject matter, it works perfectly to build suspense and draw you in.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />A terrifying reveal of the birth of the virus.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film had a production budget of $60 million, and has grossed an estimated $135 million worldwide at the box office.

0451228375|3.0|After enjoying \\"Pillars,\\" I dived right into this book. What might have been a creative and thrilling sequel turned out to be a formulaic rehashing of the earlier work.  The themes tire as they are all repeated: all bishops are evil and ambitious; all nobility are sadistic beasts; all women are geniuses, all men are stupid (except the few conniving clerics); all monks are randy; all nuns are well-intentioned angels, if not exactly pious. The only good priests are the downtrodden who happen to have concubines. Sex is good when women want it, but marriage is bad for women. (The author's obsession with breasts became so boring I began rolling my eyes and sighed in disappointment at every new squeeze.) In an age noted for its intense religious fervor, it's amazing we don't encounter one genuinely holy person -- NOT ONE!    While all of this was tolerable in \\"Pillars\\" as idiosyncratic of the characters, to reinforce all these traits as stereotypes in a second tome makes it border on the predictable and tedious, with shallow or one-dimensional characters. It also exposes the first volume as less creative than it would have appeared if it stood alone. As a literary work, \\"Pillars\\" was not well served by the publication of this second volume.    All that aside, the episodes are engaging, the writing style is fluid, and the characters somewhat compelling. With only a dash of suspension of disbelief, it makes a fun medieval soap opera. Much closer to Andrew Greeley than to Umberto Eco.
B002N4DYZO|5.0|This company lets their pressings go out of print constantly, only to resurrect them in a new re-re-release. It's annoying. This new line of opera recordings by EMI come without a libretto and translations, the bread and butter of boxed opera sets. Oh wait, you can download it! Hooray! Not.<br /><br />This is a great Fidelio and the following is my original review for it's previous incarcation [[ASIN:B00004VVZB Beethoven: Fidelio (Great Recordings of the Century)]] which is the one to get unless you like reading translations on the internet or printing and wasting your time and a bunch of paper.<br /><br />From my review dated January 30th, 2011<br /><br />Nearly 50 years have passed since this Fidelio was recorded and it still stands as one of the absolute finest accounts of this opera ever made. The sound quality has that astonishing vividness that is the hallmark of Klemperer's work with EMI. The Philharmonia orchestra was at their peak, the chorus is near perfect as well. Christa Ludwig's portrayal of Leonore has not been surpassed, nor has Jon Vickers as Florestan. I am particularly fond of Gottlob Frick as Rocco. What a different portrayal here than as Hagen on Solti's Gotterdammerung. Frick was a great singer and a terrific actor.<br /><br />Ultimately it all comes down to Klemperer, he is the star of the show. Whereas his Beethoven symphonies have never excited my imagination, his Fidelio sounds very right. Klemperer was never a mercurial conductor. He has his sound realized, he picks a tempo and he carries it through. He lacks the imagination of Furtwangler or the expressiveness of Bernstein. Still he manages to have the better cast, a great orchestra and a terrific producer in Walter Legge.<br /><br />All the big moments come through with grandeur, just listen to the dungeon scene. The finale takes on the air of true occasion and comes together as a spiritual experience. The Leonore 3 is tacked on as the last track. ( Solid performance but here I'll go with Karajan and Furtwangler ). This Fidelio is definitely one of Klemperer's greatest recorded achievements. No need to say more.

0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has introduced a new way to look at success in his book Outliers.  Gladwell has his own opinion on how success is achieved.  As a college student, we are given many different books to read.  This is one that I would recommend to all WSU students, faculty and anyone else who enjoys reading.  The book opens by telling the reader stories of hockey and a community.  He begins to persuade readers to look at these scenarios in different ways.  He shows his readers how Steve Jobs became successful.  He points out why Chinese people are so much better at math than Americans are.  He tells his readers how Bill Gates created Microsoft and how he became such a successful computer genius.  He shows his readers a plethora of examples to support his theory of success.  He goes on through the book to prove his theory about how success is achieved.  He does a wonderful job getting his point across to his readers.  After reading this selection, my view on how success is achieved has somewhat changed.  Gladwell points out how many different famous people became successful.  His main idea in this book is to show his readers how success is achieved and has been achieved throughout history.  He believes a person's birthday, where they live, who lives in their community, and how much practice a person has is a high contributor to success being achieved.  Gladwell is an extraordinary writer.  His books pull readers in to reading.  This book is marvelous and I believe that everyone should read it.

He trusts no one, not even his pet dog!<br /><br />He spends his family's limited income on expanding his underground storm shelter and loses his job. His mission is to protect his family and especially his deaf daughter. His wife is on the verge of leaving him and the small town he lives in believes he is crazy. He thinks he is going insane like his mother went insane at the age of 30....<br /><br />Director and writer Jeff Nichols has written a script reminiscent of a Stephen King novel. A troubled man thinking he is doing the right thing but to the outside world it looks like he is acting irrational. This is a well written and acted movie and Michael Shannon does a perfect job portraying Curtis LaForche. The movie does move a little slow at times but it is done on purpose to make you understand the dilemma and mental anguish that the protagonist is going through.<br /><br />Curtis's obsessive compulsive behavior is ruining his life! Is it a premonition or insanity? My wife and I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to you!

I'm ashamed that so many people can't see that this is about the eternal love between mother and child. I'm really sad after reading all the reviews calling this creepy and saying they never want to look at it again.

B0046ECFRM|5.0|Short Introduction: I'll be honest, I've seen this book advertised and a while and I never wanted to know what it was about because the title is kind of embarrassing. Whenever someone in my family sees me reading, they always have to ask the title and I didn't want to go down that road. But I am so glad I gave this book a chance.<br /><br />Anna's parents are divorced and after Anna's father finds commercial success with writing, he decides that Anna should spend her last year of high school at a boarding school in Paris, in order to get a little culture infused in her life.<br /><br />Anna is dead set against the idea given that she has a best friend, a sort of crush, and a little brother who needs watching after school. As Anna immerses herself in the Parisian culture and a new group of friends, she changes and learns that while she's away, home changes too.<br /><br />Plot: I love the plot. When Anna first comes to SOAP (School of America in Paris) she doesn't know anyone and therefore, must start from scratch in the friends department. After a fateful meeting with Meredith which then leads her to meet St. Clair and the rest of Meredith's group, readers can sense that there's a chemistry between Anna and St. Clair. The only problem? He has a girlfriend.<br /><br />I really enjoyed that Perkins stretched out the romance for close to the entire book, but I also felt that St. Clair and Anna let each other down too many times. I knew that this story was going to have a happy ending, but I was really surprised that after letting each other down so many times that Anna and St. Clair would be able to work it out in the end. Love conquers all, I guess!<br /><br />Writing: What I really enjoyed is how funny this book is. There were a lot of moments (usually between Anna and St. Clair) that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Bonus Factors: Paris. I have never been to Paris and so I found Stephanie Perkins' descriptions to be just wonderful. The way she writes and the places she describes really makes you feel like you're there. I also felt like I got a little culture and history lesson, learning about things like the Pantheon and the Eiffel Tower.<br /><br />Protagonist: Anna is interesting, because she isn't what I expected her to be. In the beginning of the book when she's boo-hooing about going to Paris I was worried because I thought she was going to be complaining about it the whole time. But she didn't. On her first night she met Meredith and immersed herself in Meredith's group of friends, which took courage. Anna's also pretty sassy when she talks with St. Clair and I found that pretty entertaining.<br /><br />Who Would I Recommend this Novel To?

B005CS3WO6|1.0|The original posting I was responding to indicated that their was to be a dvd as well as a 2nd cd included.  Neither of these were in the shipment I received and when contacting the seller was informed it was not part of my purchase.  I have the original email indicating the recommendation for the product I beleived I was purchasing.  Prices are identical only less product received; only half the songs I was led to believe I would be receiving, and no accompanying dvd.  Not at all satisfied!!!

B0025UHKNS|5.0|This is my first product review ever!  I always read them but never take the time to review products until this one.<br /><br />I've been wanting a GPS watch for several years now.  Recently, I found one on craigslist but the lady sold it just before I called about it.  Two weeks later I saw another 405CX on craigslist and it was in a pawnshop.  I was thinking that it would have missing pieces but it turned out that it was brand new and the box was never opened.  Best part is they only wanted 90 bucks for it...I was so excited I took off work and drove there to buy it.<br /><br />I took this watch out of the box and was impressed.  It has a really nice normal watch look to it.  The original wrist band was very un-atractive but I noticed they had other bands that resembled straps.  Several sizes came in the box with the tool to change them out.  Very nice.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to use this watch so I charged it up which seemed like eternity..but finally I got 50% charge.<br />While it was charging I used the time to set the watch up.  I felt a little clumsy working the touch bezel but I had it down in no time.  The functions of this watch are so simple you really don't need to read the manual.  I had the watch set up and had the Garmin Ant Agent loaded on my PC in 30 minutes.  Garmin has an awsome wesite called Garmin Connect. You simply walk up to your PC and the watch automatically transfers data to the website.  I was very impressed.  I won't go into detail with the website but it practically shows you every detail of your workout...again, impressive.<br /><br />I decided to take it out on a 3 mile run.  I put the heart monitor strap on which had a nice fit.  The watch auto detected the HR monitor almost immediately and started showing my heart rate.  This is something I really wanted from this watch and from some of the other reviews it seems like the watch didn't show accurate heart rate so I was going to watch it closely.<br /><br />Started the watch and began my run.  The heart rate kept going off and on.  Sorta bummed because like I said above...it was what everyone else complained about...but the time distance was very nice and accurate.<br />I finished my run and walked into the house.  The watch started transferring data before I got to the PC.  Took a look at the data and saw that my heart rate was between 30 and 110.  Not accurate at all...NOT GOOD.  All of the other data was spot on.<br /><br />Next day I took the watch to work and updated the firmware...very easy.  I later watched a few videos on Garmin's website that recommended to \\"WET\\" the electrodes of the heart rate monitor (I hold them under running water in the sink now).  I did that and changed out the battery.  Wah La...the heart rate monitor was working good.  In fact, I'm wearing it right now as I'm writing this review.  Heart rate is reading 62 BPM.<br /><br />I learned to turn off the gps when not needed. It will eat the battery up if you don't turn it off! Simple 2 taps on the bezel and it's off.<br /><br />I changed out the original wristband with the strap style band.  Should have done that from the beginning.  The new strap doesn't allow the watch to rotate on my wrist.<br /><br />If you want a great watch..Buy this one.  I've used it now for 3 weeks and it is my most prized possesion.  I give this product 5 stars with no hesitation.
B0059XTUMC|3.0|The Artist is an almost totally silent film made by Michel Hazanavicious starring Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, John Goodman, James Cromwell & Penelope Ann Miller. Set in 1927 Hollywood as the Talkies are set to replace silent films. It chronicles the troubles of a great silent film star who doesn't want to be in talkies.<br /><br />The first half of the film is all a movie-goer could want. It has outrageous expressions on the faces of the silent actors in place of dialogue. Quirky & fun camera angles plus cute little comedy scenes & the regulation lovable dog that is as well trained as any other actor on the set. The beginnings of a failed marriage (done in a hilarious manner) & a budding new romance follow suit.<br /><br />It's the development of these that mystified both me & my wife. You'd figure that there was a concrete reason that our star (the artist) doesn't want to be in talkies as well as a reason that no one offers him a chance later. It takes the whole movie to find out this cannot be true. The motivations & goals of this budding romance are disjointed & unfocused even at the end. Was it romance, was it friendly concern, or was it just a coincidence that stuck like glue. There is a scene early-on that leaves no doubt about what is in the woman's mind but it plays no part later on.<br /><br />The second half of the movie is the man's life on the skids surrounded by people concerned for his welfare. His alcoholism & self destructive behavior, which is agonizingly drawn out to the point of boredom & greatly overacted even for a silent, gives far too much time to see the ending coming, as well as wish you were somewhere else. The second half is as bad as the first half is good. The music, costuming, sets & cinematography are worth seeing though. It's easy to see tie-ins to Singing in the Rain & A Star is Born. Truth be told they probably should have used a better tie-in to A Star is Born but that would have led to a different & hopefully better ending. You never really get inside the guys head beyond mulish pride & you see that 5 min's into the show. It starts with a grin & ends with a grin, they even had a miniature Rin Tin Tin. For a truly great silent watch SUNRISE (1928). I'm rating The Artist 3 Amazon Stars.never really get inside the guys head beyond mulish pride & you see that 5 min's into the show.

0545425115|3.0|This book, while engaging was utterly predictable. There are other books that are equally engaging, but that give the reader a more interesting ride through depth of content, true plot-twists that you can't spot from a mile away, etc.<br /><br />Its an average book - so not bad, but also not worthy of the hype it has received. Maybe a good book for beginners. I attribute the book's current popularity more to marketing than to anything else.<br /><br />Read it if you are looking for a book to read, and don't have anything else in mind. But if you already have a list of books lined up, put it at the end of the queue - no need to rush into this one.
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|\\"This weekend's gonna be it. We're gonna get something good, I can feel<br />it.\\" During the final week at the Yankee Pedlar Inn the remaining<br />employees Claire (Paxton and Luke are determined to find out if the<br />hotel is haunted. When events begin to happen that make them feel they<br />are right the two employees get more then they asked for. I have never<br />really been a big horror movie fan. The ones I do like are the more<br />psychological ones with an actual story to them. I like the \\"Saw\\"<br />series, but most of the \\"torture-porn\\" to me is not horror. All that<br />said I liked this movie. While this is not a typical horror and is not<br />a fast moving movie at all it is still good enough to keep you<br />watching. For a lower budget movie the acting is actually really good<br />and there are scenes that will make you tense but overall this is more<br />suspense then horror I would say. This is a movie worth watching.<br />Overall, better then most of the recent horror movies. I give it a B.

B0068VZQCC|3.0|Blind Guardian's been sorely in need of a decent Greatest Hits album for a long time. Unfortunately, this album isn't really that for a number of reasons, which I'll list here:<br /><br />1.) Bizarre, watered down tracklist: In a lot of cases, what's included here is not even the singles. Why is \\"This Will Never End\\" the sole representation of A Twist in the Myth when a much better song, \\"Another Stranger Me\\", was actually the single? Futhermore, though Blind Guardian have steadily released a ballad on every album, the only representation of that here is \\"Bard's Song\\". Great pick, but what about \\"A Past and Future Secret\\", or \\"War of the Thrones\\"? While it's true that fans could argue on and on about which material best represents the band, the fact that two of these discs have around 30 minutes of empty space on them flies in the face of that-- there's way more room here than we're getting. This, I think, is one of the most shameful things Blind Guardian have ever done.<br /><br />2.) Remixes and Rerecordings aren't necessarily better: In fact, more often than not they're worse. For those who thought the reissues of a couple years ago were bad- these are not simply tracks from them but even worse remasterings. The intro to \\"Mirror Mirror\\" has been relayered (?) and just sounds weird now. \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" sounds dull, sucking away the life of even the best part (if you have to ask, you'll never know). Hansi sings through old classics like \\"Nightfall\\" and \\"Valhalla\\", the obvious fact that his voice does not have the same bite it once did painfully obvious. Futhermore, the simply remixed or re-recorded stuff has lost all flavor and now just sounds bland and muted. Imagine you're listening to Nightfall in Middle-Earth: Now, imagine you throw a blanket over the speaker, and turn the volume up as loud as possible: now, you've got what this album sounds like.<br /><br />3.) Bonus third disc lost potential: lots of this showed up on the remasters, anyway. Blind Guardian have done some amazing acoustic versions and covers over the years, and could easily fill a disc of \\"Forgotten Tales part 2\\" material, but instead we get the same demos we've already mostly heard.<br /><br />In sum, this collection isn't really for anyone aside from those that can't help themselves. Live is still a better representation of the band's material, in my opinion, and it sounds better because the recordoings are much more \\"lively\\" than the lifeless remasterings found here. Diehards might like this, but they're just as likely to be offended or unimpressed with it. People who need to collect every single thing their favorite band puts out, however.... by all means.Guardian have done some amazing acoustic versions and covers over the years, and could easily fill a disc of \\"Forgotten Tales part 2\\" material, but instead we get the same demos we've already mostly heard.<br /><br />In sum, this collection isn't really for anyone aside from those that can't help themselves.

006197806X|5.0|THERE ARE NO WORDS. I will NEVER be able to properly express my love and adoration for this series. NEVER. Lauren is brilliant, and I am infected with deliria for these perfectly captivating books.<br /><br />Delirium was my FAVOURITE book of 2011 and it absolutely blew me away. I just sobbed after I finished it, for all its emotional turmoil and the way Lauren Oliver managed to wring my heart like a wet towel. So of course, I have been anxious for Pandemonium and I devoured it as soon as I got an ARC in the mail.<br /><br />How am I supposed to express my thoughts on this book?? I can't write reviews that will do Lauren's books justice. I just can't, I'm actually incapable of doing that. Because Lauren's book consistently affect me in such a personal, INTIMATE way.<br /><br />But I'm going to try. Because everyone needs to read these books!<br /><br />Reasons to Read:<br /><br />1.Sobbing, tears, forever crying:<br />Delirium, as a series, is incredibly heartbreaking. A world where love is treated like a disease? SCARY. And Lena struggles so much, both physically and emotionally. She's particularly fragile in Pandemonium after what has occured in The Last Chapter of Delirum (capitalization is clearly required, as those of you who have read it know). Pandemonium is tragic in its own way, as Lena is so desperately trying to cope with the events and changes which took place in Delirium. It isn't easy. But what can you expect?<br /><br />2.Stunning, lyrical writing:<br />I'm convinced that Lauren is a sort of author genius. I have yet to be unimpressed by anything she's written!<br /><br />\\"I wonder if this is how people always get close: They heal each other's wounds; they repair the broken skin.\\" And everything has such meaning and depth behind it. Nothing is just said casually, and it is all so thoughfully laced with emotion and words to draw you in to the story itself. Pandemonium is another indication of extreme talent on Lauren's part.<br /><br />3.Two timelines:<br />I'm not usually a fan of books written with two alternating timelines from chapter to chapter, but I was really impressed by how it was done in Pandemonium. Normally I find it to be confusing, and unnecessary as it doesn't seem to add much to the story. However, Lauren would finish a chapter from the past and then carry over the same atmosphere and feelings into the new chapter based in the present. And THAT impressed me and really made the story flow well. Yet it all felt very natural, so I'm not even sure this was an intended result of the writing style.<br /><br />4.Those hints and teasers which made fans worried...<br />We've all heard the nerve-wracking hints and teasers about Pandemonium; and I know I'm not the only Delirium fan who was dreadfully worried about the direction Pandemonium would take. I refuse to give anything away and confirm one way or another, but I can say that I was utterly surprised by what Lauren included in the story but was still very impressed with how it was handled. And that left me feeling extremely satisfied overall.<br />Now, I will say that Pandemonium did not leave the same impact on me that Delirium did. I found it harder to relate to some of the new characters introduced, and I so dearly miss Alex. I ADORE Alex. It's forever Alex for me &lt;3<br /><br />But I can say with complete confidence that I'm going to be counting down the days to Requiem, very very soon and I cannot wait to see how this series ends! Totally one of my favourites in YA and dystopian.<br /><br />ARC received from HarperCollins Canada for review.<br />I'm not usually a fan of books written with two alternating timelines from chapter to chapter, but I was really impressed by how it was done in Pandemonium.

B006UG90RM|3.0|If this were a new band, would you like this album? I cannot accept the 5 star reviews, because this is not their best album. The 1 stars are also childish--this is anything but crap, and don't kill an entire album because you're angry with the production. If VH had tried to make Diver Down 2 or another 1984 everyone would complain that they were trying to return to past glory. But since this album is a different Van Halen than what we knew and loved, people are mad that they aren't returning to past glory. Cake and eat it too? Forget the 80s...they're long gone.<br /><br />The album is decent. There are probably a couple too many Metal songs that seem superfluous--I'd have replaced them with a couple more 60s covers like they used to do, or some bluesy things. But Blood and Fire is right up there with their great ones (let it grow on you) and there are 3 or 4 additional super solid tunes. The rest is full-throttle energy. I agree that the mix is dense and wall of sound-ish. But who's complaining? I agree with Rolling Stone--we've needed this for a long time and it could have been a lot worse. Accept it for the fun album it is and stop fretting over days gone by. This album is anything but boring. Buy it and enjoy it, and be glad for what you have. In the world of Gaga and Bieber, I'll take as much of this as I can get.<br /><br />Also...saw them in Chicago for 4th show of tour. Transcendant. Eddie is incredible and Alex and Wolf solid. Dave didn't try to steal the show. He was almost like a carnival barker, highlighting the talents of the 3 musicians. Pure fun. The four songs they played from this album seemed to fit right in.

0439023513|1.0|Suzanne Collin's flippant application of gore, violence, and senseless death is an affront to humanity.  This series is like watching someone trapped in a burning car wreckage.  You wish there was something you could do to put a stop to it, but at the same time you can't look away.  It leaves you feeling sick inside.<br /><br />The cover on this book is light blue with what looks like a dove on it.  This symbol of peace belies the brutality within.  I literally tore this hardcover book to shreds when i was finished with it.  If you've read the first two and are considering buying this to get closure, don't.  There is no redemption for the horrors it contains.  The ending is dissatisfying beyond belief. Please spare yourself the pain and don't get attached to this series.  If you have already bought a copy, please dispose of it.

0440244412|5.0|I apologize to the author for not reviewing each book individually.  What a great series!  Every book is engaging and filled with suspense, drama and a lot of fun.  The series moved seamlessly from book to book and my only gripe is that it ended...maybe?  Pick this series up.  It is well worth it.

B0055SWM08|5.0|If you enjoy puzzle/logic games, you'll love Quell! The added bonus is the soothing music. The game and music really do take you to a pleasurable, zen-like place, which prevents you from hurling your Droid across the room when a puzzle completely stumps you time and time again. This is a good thing! :) Don't hesitate to download this app if puzzles are your thing!
006197806X|5.0|Although I thought Delirium was an entertaining read, I never would have thought that Pandemonium would leave me thinking about the story for hours and hours after finishing. Lauren Oliver packs this book with more action, more romance, and more surprising twists.<br /><br />After leaving her old life--and Alex--behind, Lena is found and rescued by a group of Invalids nearly 60 miles away from Portland. After her savior, Raven, takes her in and nurses her back to health, she's taught how to survive in the Wilds. She meets the others that live at the Homestead and learn what it's like to be in a real family, where each person helps in taking care of each other. Though her life is beginning to look up from what it used to be, Lena still can't stop herself from thinking about Alex, about how it would be if he was still alive and by her side as planned.<br /><br />She promises Raven that she will do whatever she needs to for her new family, which also means eventually making their way to the closest city in New York and living in disguise among the cured. When Scavengers kidnap her and a well-known teenage boy named Julian, she has to team up with him in order to make it out alive, possibly spilling some secrets about the past along the way.<br /><br />While I quite enjoyed Julian's character and story, I couldn't help myself from looking back to Alex and wishing he'd appear although it seems nearly impossible. Lena finds out what it's like to survive on very little, to depend on herself, and to let go of what's gone. By the end of Pandemonium, I was left aching for more; to find out what happens next. The unbelievable cliffhanger confirmed what I was hoping throughout the entire book, yet I couldn't help but want more.<br /><br />Review from The Hollow Cupboards- thehollowcupboards.blogspot.com

B0052UZIFA|4.0|Excellent game, addictive and make you think ... lag very little when you finish a level and change to the next one. Maybe my table processor is a little loaded by other process that I forgot to kill. Other than that the game runs perfectly, with good graphics and game play ... no lagging during playing at all and so far haven't crash ... ever.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the moment i picked up this book i knew i was hooked with such compelling charaters and the numerous heart stopping moments this is definitly on my top ten list. Katniss has a place in my heart right next to Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. Can`t wait to read the next two books. Thank you Suzanne Collins.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I have used PI on various platforms over a number of years -- and loved it. But this version is a non-starter.  It relies on the Kindle Fire's calendar, which doesn't exist. What I don't understand is why it can't sync with my Google calendar. PI on my iPad syncs seamlessly with my Google calendar. Save your money! I gave it one star because it looks nice. So, who cares -- it doesn't work for me.

B005FUTBWS|5.0|I know this film is not directly about WBC, but it sure reminded me of that pathetic excuse for a church! Ever since Matthew Shepard was killed, I've waited for someone to slap this group across the face and show how warped they really are, even inadverdently. But too many people were too afraid to even try, so, to me, pardon my french: it's about f-ing time! Thank you, Kevin Smith, for being the one to do this! With this film, you didn't miss a beat. Some readers may think I'm giving Kevin Smith too much credit here, but let me clarify something for you: I do know the WBC didn't kill Matthew Shepard, but everyone knows what they do and did at his and over a dozen other funerals, and unless you truly believes he's right, free speech protection or not, it saddens and infuriates me that the public not only tolerates them, but also, the news has the gull to give them undeserved attention! Why is this? If we ignore them, they might go away!<br />Enough with the rant, now to the review. Dogma and Red State are now my two favorite Kevin Smith movies. The cast is very well chosen, Michael Parks as the villianous pastor, was incredible, John Goodman was very good as the agent trying to diffuse the situation, the rest of the young cast was pretty good too, but don't forget Melissa Leo either. Is it worth owning? If you like movies that step on toes unapolegetically, probably. However, this may dissapoint some of Kevin's devout fans, but give it a try as a rent first, you might be surprised. Final note: please read this review with an open-mind, and in its entirety, before judging me harshly, it is my opinion, and I'm entitled to it, comments are welcome...w/in reason.
0385534639|5.0|Night Circus is a novel of quiet intensity. The plot evolves slowly and intricately, like a tapestry laced with beautiful imagery.

1439192812|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable and packed with accessible information, The Magic of Reality is a good choice for older kids wanting real answers to big questions. The art is gorgeous and engaging. The writing is lovely and informative but far too advanced for younger readers. I would recommend this book for bright children, 8 years and up. Despite some wonderful techniques used by Dawkins to help children grasp the more difficult concepts, I would recommend that parents sit and read with kids on the younger end of this spectrum. Children 12+ would probably be fine tackling this book alone. This could also be a great starter book for older readers that struggle with scientific illiteracy.<br /><br />There is an Ipad interactive e-book for The Magic of Reality for Mac enthusiasts looking to check this out. I have read about it and it sounds wonderful but I am hoping they release this for Android! I would definitely buy it.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Rhiannon Giddens' voice in the title track, with Dom Flemon's chops.... And I am home!<br /><br />Delivering a wonderful sonic mixture of Mid-to-late 19th Century Black American Music and reels, jigs, hoe-downs, near-folk-rock, a killer ring-shout, and even Caribbean-influenced tunes--put this album on a par with the Grammy-winning [[ASIN:B002U33GQU Genuine Negro Jig]] from a couple of years back.<br /><br />This outstanding recording is clearly live in studio (as I hear everything while these amazing musicians go all out, full-tilt, and cakewalk to town and back and then do it again!) and being live on recording was a great call. It gives the Carolina Chocolate Drops a touch of their on-stage feel in your house, car, living-room, headphones, and on--and that makes it all the better. This recording is a blast to listen to, no-matter where you are while enjoying this outstanding album or what your audio player of choice happens to be, in the moment.<br /><br />The Carolina Chocolate Drops are wonderfully all over the map with their instrumentation and the sheer virtuoso performances by each and every musician (including the outstanding new multi-instrumental member Hubby Jenkins--who replaced Justin Robinson,) this album surpasses the last (major album--as they have lots of little EP's and co-operative efforts) in sheer exuberance. It is impossible to ignore (nor would one want to!,) Adam Matta as the Chocolate Drop's mouth-music-making beat-boxer extraordinaire. Listen to Country Girl, and you'll think he is the drummer--until he plays around a bit to prove that it is all his fantastic face (um, sound-wise;-) making those noises. And last, but not least, the Carolina crew had a killer cellist named Leyla McCalla sit in--and she's (apropos, no?) a perfect fifth.<br /><br />As with my previous complaint, the album is short--coming in at about 45 minutes (hey, we got six more minutes! Yay!!!!) But, I'm not sure that it isn't just a \\"leave them wanting\\" moment. Yet, I do want the full 70 plus minutes available on a cd from CCD.<br /><br />It is somehow apt that their near-mentor and 93-year-old fiddler Joe Thompson gets a big nod with the first tune on the album--his Riro's House, as he died in the past couple of weeks--and now he continues to live-on-in-and-with these wondrous music mavens who kindly allow me to buy and see their music.<br /><br />This album is a return to Eden in a great number of ways--and I'm thankful for that.<br /><br />Buy it and gift it. Buy it and gift it some more.o want the full 70 plus minutes available on a cd from CCD.<br /><br />It is somehow apt that their near-mentor and 93-year-old fiddler Joe Thompson gets a big nod with the first tune on the album--his Riro's House, as he died in the past couple of weeks--and now he continues to live-on-in-and-with these wondrous music mavens who kindly allow me to buy and see their music.<br /><br />This album is a return to Eden in a great number of ways--and I'm thankful for that.<br /><br />Buy it and gift it.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the games but not how much it costs to unlock new games have to keep replaying games over and over
B0050I2P32|2.0|This is by-the-book shoegaze pop/rock. The songs just drag by in the constant mid tempo beats smothered in fuzz gravy. Similar to bands like Longwave, Doves, BRMC who really bring nothing new to the table. Lyrics are also very lacking and uninspired. My biggest gripe with this band is not the music itself but all the hype that has been built around such a mediocre band. The album has its moments, but they are few and far apart. Only get this is you are a huge fan of the genre.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Its a great download it really is. It's a little weird set up but you got to get use to it. The way to get to other chapters isnt really showy like it's pretty boring. But I would download it if I was you.
B000SOYEQY|5.0|The mistake many viewers make when watching this film is to seek a portrait of lawrence etched in drama.  lean was too good a director at this moment to make that mistake.  this is pure cinema, and it is the movie itself which embodies lawrence: the wind, the stars, the surging music, the self-amused performance of that most charming of all modern british actors, peter o'toole.  above all, lawrence is present here in the landscape:  the rocks of wadi rum, the salt flats of ma-an (where omar shariff appears from out of a mirage)-- and especially in jebel toubeq (scenes secretly shot in saudi arabia-- not in jordan as the production had declared), and that black matterhorn looming behind lawrence as he begins his journey.  lawrence is here in the romantic vision of arab nationism as a hopeless ideal, in the films epic length and awesome wide screen imagery, pictures which-- let's face it-- are the closet lean ever came to the spare modernism of a kubrick.<br /><br />and, as for the scenes with claude rains as dryden, defending lawrence before a hostile british officer in cairo (\\"I know you've been educated Lawrence: it says so in your dossier\\") : as jo van fleet said in \\"east of eden,\\"  if you don't think they're funny, you ought not to go to college.<br /><br />by far the most literate script ever written for an epic,  bolt's work (which does not include key structural elements created by michael wilson) features dialogue that perfectly captures the absurdity present in the lawrence tragedy, the cruel conundrum of politics and power games which lawrence himself was all too conscious of even as he exploited it to achieve his own apotheosis.  lawrence's journey into self-anhillation is, in fact, the nightmare journey of all modern men.  as we pursue what we love, the machine that makes it possible devours it--and us-- leaving only shadows.  as we gain self-knowledge, as we soar closer to the burning sun, we grow gossamer thin until we transform into a ghost. (in the abstract the story here is an almost perfect analogue to that in kubrick's own 2001 just a few years later).  as sheriff ali (alec guiness) proclaims at the end of the film \\"what i owe you is beyond all estimation.\\"  but he is speaking to an empty vestibule.  the glory has vanished with the man.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|I had been to Rio de Janeiro a few years back, and was expecting a fun-type animated adventure through this most enigmatic city. The actual premise is OK, but I was also immediately in touch with a film that was a bit pandering to the infant mentality. I immediately thought \\"Kids ain't that dumb\\". It's admirable that the mating habits of animals were suggested, and suddenly it became a romantic comedy, with perhaps every racial stereotype along the way to add to the proceedings, except any semblance of Brazilian.<br /><br />Quite simply, I wasn't very entertained. This is entirely due to a poorly structured script. The acting was fine, and there was a lot of clever animation and displays of the glories of the city, but I'm sure most kids will write it off as stuff they'd already seen.<br /><br />Routine, considering where animated features have gone, like SHREK or WALL-E or UP.<br />I was just hoping for some originality. The Oscar-nommed song didn't blow my socks off, either.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|A Valentine's Day present from my mom!<br />I don't think any of his books will be as good as \\"The Notebook\\" but I did kind of enjoy this book. There were some pitfalls thought and it was very formulaic: I thought Clayton's character was overdone, Beth's about face when she heard Victor called it a lucky charm was sudden and hard to follow why, and the ending was predictable.<br /><br />I wish there was more of the kid, Ben, he was a pretty likable character.
B007DVJMEO|5.0|I recently bought a few 180 gram LPs, Graham Nash's, \\"Song for Beginners.\\"  I've either forgotten how my old LP or CD sounded, or it's a vast improvement with regards to sound quality.  The vocals seem to be so much clearer, and I can actually hear Graham's acoustic guitar in the background The snare and cymbals are stunning recreated.  Of course, the new LP says remastered and remixed, so that could explain some of the change in percussion.  Organs are so clear, they seem to be in the same room.  \\"Chicago\\" is a real treat, but \\"I Used to Be a King\\" is worth the price of the whole LP. Johnny Barbata plays with the style he's famous for:  He's played drums for so many big names, he's become a household name.  [Aye, I'm a drummer.] I'm so happy I purchased this wonderful LP again.
B005HSL626|3.0|this is an amazing app but not the best Doodle jump is the best. very addicting but once you beat the game you stop playing it and don't play it again maybe once or twice a month.
1594201927|4.0|In general it is a collection of anecdotes (popular book) vs. establishing a framework for types of money and evolution through history (which would be more dry and academic, but a lot more logical).  It probably works better if you're already familiar with financial history to some extent, or will read more about it separately -- it really isn't a good complete introduction to the evolution of finance, due to lack of structure.<br /><br />Quite interesting.  I'd heard of most of the things in the book before, although their relative importance was new to me.<br /><br />The main area missing is Free Banking in general - the era of Scottish Free Banking (late 1800s), the Chinese banks with chop notes, etc.  He covers the dangers of both gold (without fractional reserve) and fiat money (badly managed and otherwise), but doesn't go into the free banking side.<br /><br />Probably the most striking thing is the relationship between financial innovation and fraud throughout history -- some of the greatest financial innovators were also basically criminals.

B007AOA3F6|5.0|I bought a few 180 gram LPs recently to see what all the fuss was about; then I found it.  They are so well done!  this LP reads like a Who's Who in musical circles.  4/5 of Jefferson Airplane are here (not the drummer--but Mickey Hart and Michael Shrieve sound so good!).  Jerry Garcia's there playing those fantasy-like notes on the steel, and it really sets the mood.  Add Neil Young, Graham Nash, and Joni Mitchell, and you've gotten a force to be reckoned with.  This is easily the best LP from the solo efforts of the other Byrds. \\"What are Their Names' sneaks up on you, and though light on lyrics, the song makes it's point.<br /><br />\\"Tamalpais High (At About 3)\\" and \\"Traction in the Rain\\" are stunningly beautiful.  The A Cappella \\"Orleans\\" is up in the stratosphere somewhere. Just gorgeous.  \\"Song with No Words\\" (Tree with No Leaves)is a precursor to David and Graham's meaningless-syllables work that came later.  Just as lovely as if it had words.  It's all about the melody.  \\"Orleans\\" just fills the room.  I still don't understand the words (French?), but I love hearing David's voice underneath (and it sticks out a little at the end of the phrases on \\"Orleans).<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that I love David's \\"pretty\\" stuff better than his rockin' material.  I've always had trouble getting into \\"Cowboy Movie\\" or \\"Almost Cut My Hair.\\"  For one, I can't tell what he's saying half the time, but just because it means nothing to me doesn't mean that it has no use:  millions love this song.<br /><br />\\"I'd Swear There was Someone Here\\" sounds Native American to me.  [I don't like calling them Indians because they're not from India, and the name not only does them an injustice, it's confusing at times.] Definitely other-worldly sounding to me.  I used to love laughing until the Byrds reunited and did that really sloppy version of it.  I keep hearing that sloppy version--I need to get that one out of my head, so I can enjoy \\"Laughing\\" again. A very wonderful LP that is worth the price ($24 I think).that is worth the price ($24 I think).
0385342063|5.0|I am in love with this book!. I read all of Sophie Kinsellas books and this is by far the best. It was hard for me to even put this book down and it gave me tons of laugh out loud moments. Highly reccomend
B002HNA95E|1.0|On one hand, it does seem appropriate for WB and Madonna to have a definitive collection at the end of their long career together.  On the other hand, cheap packaging, horrible new songs and LP versions of hit songs....nothing new!<br /><br />Meh, this was just another pathetic excuse to earn an extra buck off of people.  It's So Cool, Celebration and especially Revolver are really pathetic Madonna songs.  I was kind of embarrassed for her when she put Revolver out, with those horrid lyrics repeated to infinity, \\"my love's a revolver, do you wanna die happy...\\"<br /><br />The main problem with this release is that not only does it not give you updated, cut single releases of songs like Holiday, it gives you versions from 1983?!  Every Madonna fan already has those songs, so this totally came off as a cheap attempt to grab an extra buck.  Madonna seems to be doing a lot of that, and really, only that this last decade.  So tragic.
0312958455|4.0|When you like an author as much as I like Michael Connelly, and when he is as prolific as he is, then there is always a fall back when you want something comfortable to read. That is the case with this novel written and published in the mid 90's. I am not quite sure, when I consider I enjoy everything he has written, why I hadn't read this one. I have pondered over it but something stopped me each time. If you are a Harry Bosch fan then this is a critical part to the puzzle that is his character. Having said that I popped The Last Coyote into my Kindle some time ago and pushed it down the list. I am glad I didn't put it off any longer.<br /><br />This one is quintessentially both Connelly and Bosch. For the detective this one harkens back to his younger, angrier days when his attitude probably needed an adjustment and when he felt particularly bullet proof. He was explosive, brash, almost antisocial and didn't much care for authority even if he was one.The Last Coyote is more than a metaphor for a beast by turns loved and hated. I must say that Connelly was writing this specifically for Clint Eastwood even if he didn't know it<br /><br />Devotees of Connelly and Bosch know a great deal about both but in this we find our favorite LAPD detective using some unrequested free time to explore his youth and come to grips with the 30 year old murder of a call girl, who just happened to be his mother. The crime was never solved. Pulling the lid off the past is an act which will prove to have consequences far beyond anything he could have imagined. The implications for a cadre of characters from high to low is explosive and deadly as they explore that awakening with him and be dragged inextricably along on this high speed race to who knows where.<br /><br />Harry is quick to see monsters under the bed but as the saying goes \\"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you\\". Despite warnings and admonitions from his superiors, his psychiatrist, old acquaintances and the better angels of his nature he can no more stop this unwarranted investigation than hold back time. And when you don't trust people by your very nature, who do you trust? It is difficult at times to appreciate that some people will throw everything away to scratch an itch the average person would have sensibly discarded early on, but you know Harry.<br /><br />Harry's pursuit of the truth takes him to Florida and Nevada and cold trails up and down Mulholland Drive before the solution hits him over the head. An unlikely ally helps pentrate the Blue Code as a technogeek risks his future in the world of forensics. I'll say no more.<br /><br />This is a must for a true understanding of Harry Bosch and for the great group of folks who read Connelly faithfully they'll wonder where I've been. What took so long? Glad I did and you will be too. 3* GIBO

B005Q1W10A|5.0|The Great War has come so the staff is shorthanded, class differences are in flux, Matthew, Thomas and William go overseas to join the battle, and those left at home struggle to support the war effort in any way they can, including turning Downton Abbey itself into a convalescent home for recovering soldiers. We enjoyed this second season of Downton Abbey just as much as the first--and that was a lot, we'd been in Downton withdrawal all year. In an interview, series creator Julian Fellows admitted he doesn't plot things out completely in advance, for instance he wasn't entirely sure at first who would be the right man for Mary, and that ambiguity made the show less predictable and more interesting. The filming is just as beautiful this time around, even the WWI battle scenes of trench warfare. We lucky Americans have the Christmas special, which wraps up the second season in a more than satisfactory but not completely conclusive way, included in this DVD set--it Britain it's apparently sold separately.
0451169514|5.0|I've been meaning to do some Stephen King reviews as I find myself rereading books I loved years ago.  I own \\"It\\" in paperback, hardcover and as an audiobook.  I just finished the audiobook last week, and the narrator, Steven Webber I believe, does an amazing job narrating the story.<br /><br />Aside from that, I find \\"It\\" to be one of my all time favorite books.  I've read reviews where people go on and on about how \\"disgusting\\" something was and even a review where someone talked about the Bible and Stephen King on another site!  Hilarious!  Let me tell you religious nuts something, there is no book more disturbing than the Bible, ok?<br /><br />Anyway, many people criticize King for meandering around and rambling on and on.  The first time I read this book, I agreed.  But after listening to it, I can see the intricacies of the plot that he has laid out.  It is a chilling book, and sadly, the movie adaptation failed to deliver as do most movies made from books.  I found the movie to this one to be particularly bad, though.<br /><br />There were some crass things that happened in the book, but think about the age group we're talking about!  Many kids at this age are exploring who they are still and what their identity is.<br /><br />Now, I am reading the new version of The Stand, where King added 500 pages, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  I will review it when I'm done, though.<br /><br />This is classic Stephen King, and makes for a great jumping off place for new readers to the genre.  Enjoy!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Gran Torino (2008)<br />Drama, 116 minutes<br />Directed by Clint Eastwood<br />Starring Clint Eastwood, Christopher Carley, Bee Vang and Ahney Her<br /><br />Gran Torino was a total surprise to me when I first viewed it. I had no idea what it might be about and the cover suggested it would be an action movie. With Clint Eastwood being almost 80 years of age at the time, I couldn't see how it would work.<br /><br />It turns out that it isn't an action movie at all. The main themes include age, the loss of a loved one, racism, friendship, family, religion, and personal growth.<br /><br />Walt Kowalsky is a Korean war veteran and one of the last white people in a neighborhood mostly populated by Hmong residents. The film opens with his wife's funeral. He's suddenly friendless and alone, but for the unwanted attention of his two sons and their families, who see him as a burden and wonder what he'll leave them when he dies.<br /><br />The local priest (Carley) promised Walt's wife that he would keep an eye on Walt and try to get him to go to confession. His immediate neighbors annoy him; especially when their boy, Thao (Vang), tries to steal his beloved '72 Gran Torino. To complete Walt's misery, he's coughing up blood and may not have long to live.<br /><br />That all sounds pretty miserable, doesn't it? Despite the grim situation, Gran Torino has a great deal of (intelligent) humor. Walt doesn't pull his punches: he refers to Asians as Gooks and Blacks as Spooks. He tells the persistent priest that he's an \\"over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promise them eternity.\\" He speaks in grunts and snarls and seems to hate every person he deals with.<br /><br />Walt is a complex character. His neighbors convince him to accept Thao's apology for trying to steal his car by offering the boy's labor for a week. Thao works hard and earns Walt's respect. The two actually develop a friendship of sorts and Walt also likes Thao's sister, Sue (Her). As unlikely as it may seem, from Walt's perspective, he finds that his neighbors are decent people and takes an interest in their lives. He finds that he has more in common with them than his own family.<br /><br />I won't give away any more details, but the story shows how people still have the capacity for change, despite advanced age and a lifetime of behaving in a certain way. The humor is frequent, with Eastwood timing his lines perfectly. At the risk of sounding dramatic, this might just be Eastwood's best acting performance. It's certainly my favorite performance from those that I have seen.s Thao's sister, Sue (Her).

B000002N3J|5.0|Something to Remember is without a doubt THE best compilation album by Madonna, with IC coming in at a close second.  I've always loved Madonna's ballads more than her dance songs.  I don't really know why.  Not that her dance songs are bad; I just think her ballads are particularly powerful.<br /><br />Live to Tell is my all-time fave Madonna song, out of all of them.  You'll See is definitely second.  I did not care for I Want You at all, though.  The combo with Massive Attack didn't really go over well in an album of ballads, but whatever.<br /><br />This was back when Madonna was still good, and had awesome music.  Bedtime Stories had come out the year before, Evita the year after, and 3 years later, Ray of Light came out, which totally blew me away.<br /><br />Like a Prayer is my favorite Madonna album, with ROL being second.  So, what happened?<br /><br />With the Music album, to me they sounded all like rejects from Ray of Light--in other words, the songs that didn't make the cut.  I mean, what is memorable about Nobody Knows Me?  Absolutely nothing.<br /><br />And people who collect demos and items from \\"the vault\\" know that songs such as Like a Flower, etc..that came out around this time really were stronger than singles being released, yet didn't make the album.  Made no sense to me.<br /><br />Next, we had American Life, after Music.  This album still gives me nightmares.  Supposedly, the concept behind the title track was to talk about being an American in the modern age, etc...the message wasn't conveyed to me, yet when the original video came out, I loved it!  Even with the rap garbage.  Keep in mind that the song itself had nothing to do with taking an anti-war stance during the horrid Bush regime.  The lyrics are what I'm referring to.  There is nothing in there about war.  Drinking a soy latte with bombs going off?  Doesn't really go together.  But just when I thought the song was redeemable, she pulled the original video so as \\"not to offend\\" people.  Instead, she gave us this dumbed down version of her singing in front of world flags?!  Since when had Madonna cared about offending people?  Awful decision; oh, but they go down from there....<br /><br />Confessions sounded like one LONG song stretched out over the entire length of the cd.  All the songs sounded the same, and it was really quite bland.  The only saving grace was Madonna using ABBA's song in Hung Up.  This is where Madonna starts to really decline.  She starts using other people's material in her songs that don't belong there.  If it weren't for ABBA, the song would have been awful.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste my time on Hard Candy, because deep down, every Madonna fan knows that it is a piece of garbage.  Using Timbalake, Kanye West, etc..was just a pathetic attempt at getting the young crowd to listen, which I will never understand because Madonna had a loyal fan base.  Does someone need to tell Madonna that she already has plenty of fans and doesn't need to stoop down to doing utter rubbish just to push the CD to kids?<br /><br />Sorry for the ramble, but my main point that is if you get one album, make it this one.  I was a Madonna fan for years, but my fanship started declining after ROL, and totally disappeared after Hard Candy.<br /><br />Sure, there are lots of reasons not to like Madonna.  The way she acts compared to what she preaches with Madonnaballah is really off putting.  I had just had enough of admiring a totally self centered woman who really doesn't care about other people.  Like I said in another review, I am no longer a sheep; haven't been for a few years now.<br /><br />I am not looking forward to MDNA, simply from what I've heard so far, as well as the perpetual bringing in of flash in the pan artists to appeal to kids.  The rap garbage by that Minaj doesn't belong anywhere NEAR a Madonna song.  Don't even get me started on LMFAO....Ew....and it's the way it's done as well.  Some talentless hack, prolly Minaj, says something at the end of the new single to the effect of \\"I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan...\\" or other such nonsense.  Yeah, stay away from everything Madonna did after ROL, including MDNA, and you will be fine.  Enjoy!
B001CDLATE|5.0|Baraka (1992)<br />Documentary, 96 minutes<br />Directed by Ron Fricke<br /><br />There are few films that I think everyone should watch at least once, but Baraka may be one of them. Perhaps it should be shown in schools too?<br /><br />Baraka is a word in the ancient Sufi language meaning \\"the thread that weaves life together\\" and the film contains no dialogue and no explanation. It's a series of images taken from 24 different countries. Some of the images show scenes of animal life or extreme beauty; others show human rituals and the effects of war or poverty. The result provokes a lot of thought if you are open to such things.<br /><br />Shot on 70mm film, the Blu-ray presentation is among the best live action films the format has to offer. Some of the images are located in places that are not normally accessible to people. An image of an underground cavern springs to mind.<br /><br />If you follow the film closely, you are likely to be moved. The beauty is breathtaking, but some of the sadder scenes could take your breath away for a different reason. The contrast between good and evil is one of the themes running throughout the documentary. You might also question the path you have chosen in your life when you realize that most humans are continually racing toward something and few stop to appreciate the beauty in their lives.<br /><br />The special features are informative and almost as interesting as the film itself. If you are curious about where the images came from, the special features answer most of your questions.

B0013FBS20|5.0|I Am Legend (2007)<br />Drama, Science Fiction, Thriller, 101 minutes<br />Directed by Francis Lawrence<br />Starring Will Smith and Alice Braga<br /><br />Will Smith is one of the biggest box office draws, whether it's for action, comedy or drama. He has the charisma to pull off just about any role and is improving as a dramatic actor as he matures. I Am Legend contains some action, but it's a futuristic drama more than anything else. Smith is required to show considerable range.<br /><br />The movie makes this list because it shows how people adapt in extreme situations. Robert Neville (Smith) is possibly the last man alive after a cure for cancer turns people into aggressive zombie-like creatures who live in the dark. He's a scientist and appears to have a natural immunity to the virus. He's trying to develop a vaccine that will help these creatures recover their humanity.<br /><br />Imagine if you had an entire city to yourself. How would you spend your time? Neville has a routine. He wakes up at the same time each day, works out, and then systematically searches the buildings in the area for canned food and bottled water. This is vital for his survival. He also continues his research and tries out his vaccines on laboratory rats. In order to maintain the illusion that he's not alone, he watches recorded TV shows and talks to mannequins while he works his way through the inventory of a local video store. Every day at Noon, he waits at a predetermined location for any response to his radio messages offering hope and shelter to other survivors.<br /><br />New York is an abandoned city. Grass has reclaimed most of the land and Neville has to compete with lions when he goes hunting for dear. The early special effects are very convincing and we are drawn in to Neville's world. Some of the exposition is achieved through showing Neville's dreams and we discover that his wife and daughter were evacuated along with the other healthy people left in the city. His only friend now is Sam, his dog. Unlike Neville, Sam can be affected by contact with the creatures roaming the city.<br /><br />One of the saddest scenes in the movie comes after Sam is bitten by a creature carrying the virus. He injects her with serum in the hope that it will prevent her from transforming into a deadly version of his former companion. If you are an animal-lover, it's a hard scene to watch.<br /><br />I won't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. Is Neville really alone? Will he develop a cure? If he does, will it even be possible to capture the creatures and successfully administer the cure?<br /><br />The film raises a serious question; are humans the biggest threat to their own survival?<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes an alternate ending. Both endings are hopeful, but one is considerably more hopeful than the other. The Blu-ray presentation is just about perfect.nd now is Sam, his dog.

B000M5AJQI|5.0|The Departed (2006)<br />Crime, Drama, 151 minutes<br />Directed by Martin Scorsese<br />Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson<br /><br />I have heard a lot of criticism for The Departed because it's based on the Hong Kong film, Infernal Affairs (2002). While I'm usually against remakes of any kind, there are a few that were worth the effort. Another criticism is that Scorsese won the Oscar for Best Director for this instead of several superior films. I understand that argument, but it shouldn't be a reason to downgrade the film. I must admit I haven't seen Infernal Affairs, and there are still a few Scorsese films that I haven't got around to, but I am certain that The Departed is my favorite from the many I have seen.<br /><br />The Departed works for me because of Scorsese and the incredible cast. DiCaprio and Damon are both superb in their roles and both are among my favorite modern actors. Jack Nicholson dominates the screen as Frank Costello and Ray Winstone is perfect as his main sidekick. This is also the first film in which I noticed Vera Farmiga. The supporting cast includes Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen. What's not to like?<br /><br />The movie has a complicated plot and it's a pleasure to see it unfold. There isn't much action, but the few scenes that do contain action are violent and shocking. The movie is enhanced by the dialogue which partly explains why it is 50 minutes longer than Infernal Affairs. The characters have considerable depth and I always come away from the movie feeling that I know them.<br /><br />The Departed won Oscars for Best Director, Film Editing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. Although it didn't win any acting awards, there wasn't a bad performance from any of the cast. Writing this now, I realize that I need to see the movie again soon. It's definitely one of my favorites and easily in my Top 20.
B000OONQ9O|2.0|Man was I furious to see how much this film was changed when I re-watched this directors cut.  This new version improves on nothing and only serves only to distract from the original classic.  The weird cuts and bad introduction really take away from the film.  Plus the whole comic book transitions just don't fit.  All these things ruin the pacing of the film and if this is one of your favorite movies then it is bound to bother you.  The special features and picture quality are pretty good though.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight (2008)<br />Action, Crime, Drama, 152 minutes<br />Directed by Christopher Nolan<br />Starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart<br /><br />I don't like superhero movies as a rule and only watched The Dark Knight so that I could confirm my belief that all the hype was unjustified. To my surprise, I ended up loving the experience.<br /><br />There are a number of reasons why I don't usually watch the genre. The characters are often shallow and we don't know their true origin and motivations. Acting is cheesy and deliberately over the top. The need for humor means that I'm likely to be assaulted by childish jokes. The plot is there as an excuse for cool special effects and a lot of action. In short, I don't believe in the characters or the world in which they live.<br /><br />The Dark Knight overcomes all of those problems and delivers something special.<br /><br />The characters are far from shallow. After seeing the movie, I made a point of seeing Batman Begins, in which Nolan shows us how Bruce Wayne became Batman. We see the training that allows him to fight criminals. His wealth enables him to develop weapons, vehicles and protective clothing that could actually exist. The acting is superb and many of the cast are Oscar-winners or nominees. Instead of making The Joker an unbelievable character such as the one depicted by Jack Nicholson in 1989, Nolan and Ledger invent a character who could be walking around in New York or anywhere else. He's psychotic, but we understand his twisted logic. When he makes a threat, we believe that it's possible and that he could pull it off.<br /><br />Nolan's world is totally logical and could easily exist in reality.<br /><br />The Dark Knight has enough thrills and action to satisfy fans of the genre, but it's much more than that. It works as a character study and as a police procedural. It's also a thriller, with elements of romance.<br /><br />If there's one movie that transcends the genre, The Dark Knight is it.Knight is it.

It hooked me and I followed the incredible journey of Sophia Parsons.  Exciting, historical and detailed, this book is one you will enjoy very much.  It taught me some things I had no idea of.  Made me wonder about the people I knew growing up and those still in my life today.  The love story between Sophia and Charles is timeless. You have to read this one.<br /><br />The only problem I found is that it was a slow starter. It kind of dragged at the beginning as if it wasn't sure where to go first. It does take off though and it's like opening a window and letting the air in.<br /><br /> ~Copy of book provided by author in exchange for a fair review

B001YV504U|5.0|Field of Dreams (1989)<br />Drama, Family, Fantasy, 107 minutes<br />Directed by Phil Alden Robinson<br />Starring Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Ray Liotta<br /><br />Here's a movie that feels like vintage Spielberg. It was nominated for three Oscars: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Score, but failed to win. It's more of a fantasy than a drama and the viewer is required to ignore logic and any expectation of how the real world works. If you can do that, there's a chance you might end up loving Field of Dreams.<br /><br />The story focuses on Ray Kinsella (Costner) who runs a farm in Iowa. One day, he hears a voice whispering to him out in the cornfield. It says, \\"If you build it, he will come.\\" That would be both worrying and annoying, I imagine. We aren't told what he has to build or who will come, but he eventually has a \\"vision\\" of a baseball field among the corn.<br /><br />Put yourself in that situation. Would you think you were losing your mind? Dare you tell anybody? Would you consider acting on it, even for a moment? Well, Ray tells his wife Annie (Amy Madigan) and she believes him. You would have to have an incredibly honest relationship to inspire that level of trust.<br /><br />Ray destroys part of his crop, builds the field, and somebody does come. It turns out to be Shoeless Joe Jackson (Liotta). That's amazing enough, but the voice doesn't stop. It wants something more from Ray. I won't reveal anything else about the plot as it's better to experience it for yourself.<br /><br />Costner was a huge star in the 80s and 90s and plays Ray very effectively. My favorite character is Terence Mann, played by James Earl Jones, and he should have been nominated for his performance. The whole cast works well and the story plays out like a wild fantasy adventure. I always find myself engrossed in the story, anxious to see what happens next, although I have watched the movie many times.<br /><br />Field of Dreams is nonsense, but it's heartwarming, feel-good nonsense that I will never tire of seeing.ng, feel-good nonsense that I will never tire of seeing.

B000P46QTA|5.0|The Lives of Others (2006)<br />Drama, Thriller, 137 minutes, German Language<br />Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck<br />Starring Ulrich Muhe, Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck<br /><br />Most of us have never grown up in a regime that denies us freedom of speech, freedom of thought, or freedom of belief. Those terms were part of my study material leading up to my Canadian citizenship test which I took in January. Now, after swearing an oath and becoming Canadian, I'm reminded how precious those freedoms are. If you were born in East Germany before the wall fell, or in other parts of Eastern Europe, you will understand how different life was just over 20 years ago.<br /><br />The Lives of Others is set in East Germany in 1984 and it focuses on some of the freedoms I mentioned above. We see a man interrogating a prisoner sometime in his past, and then watch him teach the importance of the techniques to a class of students. He's an expert in human behavior and body language and can tell when someone is lying. He also notes subversive behavior throughout society, right down to the students in his class. He's Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler and he's a member of the Stasi; a government secret police force.<br /><br />The story focuses on author Georg Dreyman (Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Gedeck). Dreyman writes plays and one event in particular inspires him to write a book outlining the oppressive regime in East Germany. Put yourself in his situation for a moment. Who would you trust with your ideas? How would you try to get the book published in Western Europe?<br /><br />Wiesler suspects something and thinks that Dreyman should be under surveillance, so he offers to supervise the operation himself. His team bug Dreyman's apartment and Wiesler listens from his hideaway in the roof of the building, writing daily activity reports on Dreyman and his associates.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Wiesler starts to think about his role and the purpose of his life. He's following orders, but is he doing the right thing? One of the themes early in the movie is that people remain true to their nature, but what is Wiesler's true nature? And so begins a powerful story of an authors' fight to make his opinions known and the intervention of Wiesler.<br /><br />The three main actors all give terrific performances, but it's Muhe as Wiesler who steals the show. Pay close attention to your own feelings as you watch this film and note what happens to your opinion of Wiesler. The Lives of Others is a realistic and moving account that will evoke strong emotions if you allow yourself to be drawn in. If you are worried about subtitled movies, this is one that deserves your attention so please don't let that stop you.

B006OFN0BQ|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />John Edgar Hoover, almost single-handedly, formed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) in 1935. By keeping secret files on the powerful men, including the presidents, who funded the organization, he was able to remain the director until his death in 1972.<br />Leonardo DiCaprio expertly portrays the man in J. Edgar, a film directed by Clint Eastwood.<br />The film largely covers the period from Palmer Raids, through the solving of the  Lindbergh kidnapping. It also ventures into the rumors that John Edgar was gay, and in a long term relationship with Clyde Tolson, an associate director of the FBI.<br />He also, apparently, had a flair for cross-dressing most likely brought on by his over bearing mother, Anne Marie (Judi Dench - M from the later James Bond films). When J.Edgar runs out of a nightclub because a woman asks him to dance - he's met by an outraged mother. She tells him she would rather have a dead son than a \\"daffodil\\" for a son.<br />However, Hoover was paramount in the discovery of modern crime-fighting techniques like marking money given to the kidnappers, handwriting analysis and fingerprinting.<br />He was possessed by communism, seeing conspiracy around every corner. He also had a tendency to take credit for bringing down big name gangsters, with the outlandish tales showing up in comic books.<br />J. Edgar is a great film, just beware it's long and slow moving.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Jaws (1975)<br />Thriller, 124 minutes<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg<br />Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw<br /><br />As I continue working on this 100 movies project, I am realizing that my tastes are all over the map. It ranges from 50's black and white dramas set in one room, to foreign language films, to recent blockbusters. In a way, I'm happy to find that I'm open to all types of film. Today's entry falls into the blockbuster category and was the highest-grossing movie ever made in its day.<br /><br />I remember a conversation with friends when I was 13 telling me that I had to see Jaws. They talked about the shark more than anything, and people being torn apart. I caved and ended up seeing the movie and then I read the book. There are plenty of people who have never lost that fascination for deadly creatures. Would we have Shark Week without Jaws? Why do we want to watch such a creature?<br /><br />Actually, that's not why I like Jaws.<br /><br />Jaws works for me because of the quality of the acting and the suspense created by wondering where the shark will strike next. The first hour of the movie sets everything up. Although there's nothing particularly bad about the first half, it's far from remarkable. We see a few attacks and meet the main characters.<br /><br />Chief Brody (Scheider) is my favorite character. He's intelligent, sensible, practical and calm under pressure. Hooper (Dreyfuss) is a marine biologist who thinks the problem can be solved through the use of modern equipment. The most colorful character is Quint (Shaw), who is experienced and outspoken. This group ends up tracking the shark on Quint's boat and it's here that the movie really takes off.<br /><br />The movie was made at a time when special effects had to be created by using models and machines rather than CGI, so the shark doesn't look at all realistic by modern standards. Spielberg did his best to overcome those limitations by showing the creature as little as possible. We are shown the attacks, but the camera focuses on the victim rather than dwelling on the shark itself. The fear exists in our minds and we fill in the gaps.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie takes place on the boat. All three men are drinking. Hooper and Quint begin showing each other their scars. It's a moment of release and humor while they wait for the shark to appear. Brody looks bemused by the whole exchange, but it's clear that the group is bonding. In a lesser movie, all we would see is action and more frequent and bloodier attacks.<br /><br />Another thing which should be mentioned is the music. John Williams created such a simple score, and yet we will never forget those two notes every time the shark is poised to attack. How often has it been used over the years, I wonder? The movie picked up two Oscars in the technical categories, and also won for Best Original Score.<br /><br />Jaws deserves its place in movie history. I hope nobody ever suggests remaking it to update the effects. The plot is simple and predictable, but the execution is superb.tle as possible.

B000YAA68C|3.0|Purchased the sound track believing that all the songs that are in the movie would be on the CD, THEY ARE NOT! Actually, it pissed me off! The two songs that I really loved are not on the freakin CD, WTF?<br /><br />Hell, the Pulp Fiction has everything on it including discussions between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta - How a SOUND TRACK should be!<br /><br />Songs we loved and purchased the CD for and they are no where to be found!<br /><br />1. Gerard Butler - \\"Galway Girl\\".<br />2. The funeral song!<br /><br />Now, I have to figure out how to get these elsewhere. A real bummer.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I have had one of these in daily operation since they were first released. I'm not sure when that was, but mine is certainly well over ten years old. It's reliable and just as smooth as the day I got it.<br /><br />Wen most people see it sitting next to my trackpad, they ask about it and it's a little hard to describe, even with a demo. Yes, it seems it's most frequently purchased by folks that are looking for a handy way to control iTunes, and it's worth the money if you just do that, but what a lot of people do not realize is it's a multifunction input device that can be extremely useful in almost every application.<br /><br />Someone at Griffin finally put out a new version of the software for Mac (I do not have any experience using this with Windows except the rare occasion when I run Win 7 virtualized) and it was a giant leap forward for an already super productive little dial.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know if you have never had your hands on on is that the dial is free spinning like a shuttle dial n a high end video deck. It also has a \\"button\\" press input when you press the entire dial down. You can also turn right or left while pressing down. So right out of the box you have: clockwise, counter-clockwise, press, press and hold, press and turn right, press and turn left.<br /><br />Now the really fun part, with the software, you can setup a myriad of keyboard functions on these controls. And if those six options don't cover your frequently used operations, you can add any combination of the modifier keys. For example, Control+Right = Zoom in. Control + Left = Zoom Out.<br /><br />The most obvious use is keyboard shortcuts. In my rss reader I have PowerMate setup to scroll up and down in an article by turning. Go to next article on press. Add to Instapaper on Press and Hold. Scroll article list Shift and Turn. Press and turn, next subscription. ...you get the idea.<br /><br />Beyond keyboard shortcuts are Application Launchers, Pop Up Meus, even integration with AppleScript. I think we would see these n a lot more desktops if Griffin did a better job of describing how fast you can get things done with it.<br /><br />It really shines in iMovie, iphoto, etc. being able to fly through my thousands of photos just by twirling the wheel is a real treat.<br /><br />If I had to think of something critical to say about the PowerMate, it would be that the smooth top doesn't have a dent or even textured area for my finger tip to grab when I twirl it like a jog/shuttle dial. Of course, it works just fine like it is, but a little finger tip size dimple in the top would make it perfect. They also don't give you much of a cable. Unless you plan to connect it straight into the port on your keyboard or have a desktop computer like iMac with the USB ports close by, you will want to order a USB extension cake with this.<br /><br />I also haven't read much about the light, it's not just for looks, it can be programmed to indicate all sorts of things by its brightness or pulse rate. For example, you can set it to glow more brightly as the volume increases, or flash with processor activity.<br /><br />Finally, a little known feature is that the software will allow for multiple PowerMates. This is why I'm back here ordering a companion for my trusty old knob. With two or more you can build a virtual command center with hundreds of shortcuts for our fave apps. Its my plan to dedicate one to universal functions like scroll and volume control, and the second to application specific tools.

B006OV7RQ4|4.0|By Jim Clark publisher of The Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Martha, Marcy, May, Marlene is a great little movie. The ending, however, was one of those \\"let the audience decide how it should end.\\" It needed a climax, one from the writers.<br />Our story begins with Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) running away from a cult led by Patrick (John Hawkes).<br />She calls her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and Martha moves in with her sister and brother-in-law (Hugh Dancy).<br />The movie slides back and forth, between commune days to present. Martha is unraveling and we see why.<br />Patrick has the look of a young Manson and also plays guitar and writes songs. Charlie actually met Dennis Wilson, a founding member and drummer of The Beach Boys. Charlie has actually had songs covered by Guns N' Roses, White Zombie and Marilyn Manson.<br />Patrick basically runs a self-sufficient farm where the women become sex slaves as well as workers. He is charming when he needs to be and rough as nails when crossed.<br />Martha keeps having flashbacks, won't let her sister know what happened to her so we, as viewers, are brought into this isolated lake house -- with the creepy feeling that Patrick and his true believers could break in any time to take back their Marlene. \\"Marlene\\" is the name that all the cult's women are required to use when answering the compound's telephone (as explicated in the long list of instructions that are visibly written on the wall next to the telephone).<br />This is a well made psychological thriller.
B003ZHR6T8|5.0|Falling Down (1993)<br />Crime, Drama, Thriller, 113 minutes<br />Directed by Joel Schumacher<br />Starring Michael Douglas, Robert Duvall and Barbara Hershey<br /><br />Here's a movie that has never received the credit it deserves. It opens with William Foster (Douglas) stuck in a traffic jam on the freeway. It's a hot day  and he's starting to become agitated. Eventually he cracks and just abandons the car. The first part of the story shows us a variety of encounters which don't improve his mood.<br /><br />He enters a convenience store to get change for the phone, but the insists that he buys something first. The price of soda is too high so Foster questions it. When the owner produces a baseball bat, Foster decides that the line has been crossed. He snatches the bat and smashes up part of the store. His frustration increases when a couple of gang members demand his briefcase as a toll for trespassing on their turf. They don't realize that he has a bat.<br /><br />Friends of the gang members decide to teach Foster a lesson, but their plans go awry and he's suddenly in possession of an automatic weapon. You can see how simple the plot is up to this point. When he tries to buy something from the breakfast menu at a burger restaurant, he's told that he's too late. He missed the deadline by a minute, but the person serving him won't budge. Foster pulls a weapon and insists. When he receives the meal, he looks at it in disgust. It doesn't look anything like the picture on the wall.<br /><br />In Foster's mind, he's not doing anything wrong. In fact, we can probably sympathize with him at the start of the movie. How would you react in those situations? I'm usually very laid back, but when someone wrongs me, something inside me rears up. Foster reacts in a believable way.<br /><br />The clever thing about the movie is that it gradually increases the severity of the situations. At what point do Foster's actions switch from being justified or understandable to being over the top? Where do you draw the line?<br /><br />I won't reveal how far Foster goes, but it's interesting to see how he thinks. We learn something about his life that makes this particular day something special. When you see what that is, it's easy to see why he started down the path he chose. Michael Douglas delivers one of his best performances as Foster and is ably supported by Robert Duvall who plays a cop that tries to track Foster down. The tension slowly increases throughout the movie in an intelligent way and it's always a compelling story.the top?

043599445X|5.0|I purchased this book my senior year of high school in order to prep for my IB HL biology exam. I learned nothing my junior year in AP Biology and I was really paying for it senior year- I just didn't understand a lot because I had had a bad teacher. My 12th grade bio teacher was amazing and this book, along with the syllabus, saved my life. The book is easy to follow, gives a lot of information, shows lots of pictures and diagrams, and made it easy to learn biology from. I successfully passed my HL bio test, which I owe basically to this book. Get it! You won't be sorry.
0525478817|5.0|While I have a soon to be 13 year old, I'm not a reader of Young Adult fiction but saw this on the Amazon best books of January 2012 and it sounded like a worthile read.  Wow.  Wow.  This is about as good as any fiction gets and categorizing it as Young Adult, presumably because of the age of the characters, vastly undersells the power, emotion and quality of this amazing novel.  The story is about teenage cancer victims Hazel and Augustus, their struggle with the insidiousness of cancer, their mortality and their love of each other.<br /><br />This book will make you laugh and cry, will make you think about friends and family who've had cancer or other terminal diseases, will cause you to feel blessed for your own healthy children and cause you to think about your own mortality.  \\"The Fault in our Stars\\" connects at a visceral level through amazingly real characters and a simple love story.  John Green has written a remarkable story that deserves to be read by as broad an audience as possible.  This definitely makes the list of top 10 books I have read over the last 10 years.  Please read this book, it is that special.

B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Cast Away (2000)<br />Drama, 143 minutes<br />Directed by Robert Zemeckis<br />Starring Tom Hanks<br /><br />Tom Hanks was probably the biggest box office draw for around 10 years, starting with Philadelphia in 1993. Like Meryl Streep, his performances haven't always won the awards they deserved. We expect excellence from Hanks and Streep, and it's never easy to add an Oscar after you have already won twice. Cast Away sees Hanks give one of his best performances, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The opening part of the film introduces us to the life of Chuck Noland (Hanks). He works for FedEx and is obsessed with time. Everything has to happen according to schedule or he considers himself a failure. Noland is in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), but his life is too busy for him to make her his main priority. They have to exchange Christmas gifts in the car on their way to the airport because he doesn't make time for anything more significant. This is a common theme in the lives of too many people. We rush around, earning as much money as we can, barely slowing down long enough to spend time with the people we love. You don't miss it until it's gone.<br /><br />Noland's plane crashes and he's the sole survivor. He manages to swim ashore and finds himself alone on an island. This isn't a new idea, but the execution is excellent. Noland is used to a comfortable life and has to learn how to survive in his new surroundings. Where will he live? What will he eat? Will he need to protect himself? What if he's ill or in pain? How will he remain sane? How will he escape and make his way back to civilization?<br /><br />I enjoy Cast Away because it's such a peaceful movie. All we hear are natural sounds while Noland is trapped on the island. There isn't even any musical score during this extended sequence. It helps us realize what it is like to be completely alone. How would we adapt and survive? Would we have the mental strength to seek escape? It's an examination of how human beings think, and that always appeals to me.w human beings think, and that always appeals to me.

0061537934|3.0|I liked the idea of a story written from a dog's perspective.  Enzo the dog loves racing and watching it on TV with his owner Denny, a race car driver.  I happen to love racing and dogs so I figured I would love this.  I found the main story of the family custody battle to be overly dramatic and lame.  The whole story of the wife with cancer and then the bad in-laws trying to take your only daughter away using silly rape allegations just seemed cheesy.  The dog was definitely funny.  When he got upset or mad he would tear stuff up or poop on the floor.  The connections the dog makes with racing and real life are good and the author is obviously a race fan or he did his homework.  It's not a bad book but kind of boring through a good portion of it.  It's written well enough though that you feel some connection with Enzo the dog by the end and feel a little sad.  3 stars = Liked it

B002O5M4SA|5.0|Leon: The Professional (1994)<br />Crime, Drama, Thriller, 133 minutes (extended version)<br />Directed by Luc Besson<br />Starring Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman<br /><br />Leon (Reno) is good at one thing: killing people. In other matters he's almost like a child. He can't read or write and he barely has enough skills to look after himself. He lives in an apartment building and hides away when he's not on a job.<br /><br />Leon's neighbors include 12-year-old Mathilda (Portman), who lives with her drug-dealing father. When a corrupt cop (Oldman) murders her father and the rest of the family, Mathilda turns to Leon for help. This is where things start to get interesting. Although she's 12, Mathilda has more of an idea of how to survive in the real world than Leon. She offers to take care of him in return for protection and shelter. She also wants to learn how to kill people.<br /><br />The premise is so unlikely, but it works. Leon teaches Mathilda the tricks of his trade. Some might find it inappropriate to watch a 12-year-old girl dealing with material of this nature, but Portman is superb in her first full-length feature. The two develop believable chemistry and love each other in some ways. The only other thing that Leon cares about is his beloved potted plant. The two are continually on the move to stay safe, so it's not much of a life for a young girl.<br /><br />The movie works because of the strong relationship between Leon and Mathilda. It's interesting to watch her train and see the bond deepening between the two. Revenge is always on her mind and she tries to persuade Leon to kill the men responsible for murdering her family. The final showdown is intense and contains a lot of action for fans of that genre. But, unlike many action movies, we feel as if we know the main characters and we genuinely care what happens to them.<br /><br />The Blu-ray contains the original 109-minute theatrical version and the extended 133-minute version. I recommend the latter to see the full extent of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda.nd the latter to see the full extent of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda.

My son got it when he was 12 months and he likes the book and often picks it and wants me to \\"read\\" it to him. I have been showing him the book a lot with hopes to inspire him to miraculously follow what the baby in the book does - I secretly dream that one day he will toss the diaper, walk to his potty, make a pee pee, and we all will be shouting hooray! My husband thinks I got the book just because the pictures were cute. He has no idea :)

1401233376|4.0|\\"Flashpoint\\" was hyped as \\"the point where everything changes\\" in the DC Universe. I was expecting another all-out blockbuster story from Geoff Johns. But actually, it came across more as an \\"Elseworlds\\" version of \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" starring Barry Allen.<br /><br />Which isn't to say it wasn't a good read, it was just less than I expected. The story didn't work quite as well as some others that Johns has written. (Aside from some vague references to the \\"Butterfly Effect,\\" I couldn't figure out why some of the time anomalies were happening. How does the fact that Barry Allen's mother was not murdered lead to young Bruce Wayne being killed by the mugger instead of his father? Or how does it result in Superman's krypton rocket landing in Metropolis instead of Kansas? Didn't that happen *before* Barry Allen's mother was murdered?)<br /><br />At least \\"Flashpoint\\" was easy to understand, unlike the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" mess, or the \\"Final Crisis\\" mashup, where DC finally achieved what it seemed to have been shooting for all along in the \\"Crisis\\" stories: Total Incomprehensibility!<br /><br />I was glad that you could read \\"Flashpoint\\" all the way through in one collected volume. With \\"Blackest Night,\\" I had to check out all 7-8 volumes from the local library and skip back and forth between them in order to read the story in continuity.<br /><br />Geoff Johns has produced an incredible volume of work in the past five years. While \\"Flashpoint\\" was not his best \\"event story,\\" it was still good reading.
B000W4HIX6|4.0|Die Hard (1988)<br />Action, Thriller, 131 minutes<br />Directed by John McTiernan<br />Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman and Reginald VelJohnson<br /><br />Nominated for four technical Oscars, Die Hard is one of the movies from this list which fun to watch without having any real substance or profound message. It's a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />The plot is predictable and simple. A gang of terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Rickman) decides to take hostages in a high-rise building while attempting to steal bonds from the vault. John McClane (Willis) is on vacation to visit his estranged wife and she's one of the hostages. McClane makes a base on the upper floors and tries to pick off the gang one at a time. His only contact is a radio link with a police officer (VelJohnson).<br /><br />This movie is pure action with a little suspense. Do you think McClane will succeed? Like I said, it's predictable. But Willis plays this role well. Complete with one-liners and a recurring catchphrase, the four-movie franchise is extremely corny. Somehow it doesn't matter because it's fun. Sometimes I like to watch something where I don't have to ponder the plot and guess what will happen next. If you just want some mindless entertainment with good acting and decent execution, Die Hard fits the bill.
0061969656|5.0|This is the sixth novel in the series. King Alfred The Great is striving to create the nation that will become England. Devoutly Christian, perhaps to an extreme, the fictional Alfred relies upon the martial skills of Uhtred, \\"the Saxon-born, Viking-raised warrior\\". The story is told from Uhtred's perspective as an old man who has outlived his and Alfred's many enemies.<br /><br /> In this, the sixth installment, Alfred at age 50, lies dying. Uhtred's oath is to Alfred and Uhtred is unwilling to swear fealty to Edward, Alfred's son and heir. Uhtred wants to reconquer Bebbanburg, his castle and land, which was stolen from him by an uncle. But Uhtred is poor, deliberately so by Alfred's failure to properly reward him.<br /><br /> Another legitimate claimant to the throne waits only for Alfred's final breath. The Danes who occupy much of the island want to conquer the rest. Priestly intrigues and ignorance, illicit loves, pagan beliefs swirl to create a society in which men's lives, as Hobbes' said, were nasty, brutish and short.<br /><br /> Bernard Cornwell is a masterful researcher and writer.<br /><br /> Uhtred is a mean, usually merciless warrior and aristocrat. Cross him and, by one means or another, you will die at his hands, if not in his hands. He is capable of love, kindness and occasional mercy, but killing comes naturally to him. His justice is a rough justice.<br /><br /> There's lots of action here, lots of blood. Uhtred is the only character sketched in any depth, though there's some meat on the bones of most of the supporting characters. The plots keep you going, though Uhtred occasionally wanders into unreality.<br /><br /> Overall, there's a little bit of history here, more than most of us would learn about this time and place. But, at bottom, this is still an action tale - and a great one at that.<br /><br />Jerry

B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club (1999)<br />Drama, 139 minutes<br />Directed by David Fincher<br />Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter<br /><br />Why do I like Fight Club? It seems to suggest that violence and anarchy are good things, but that's certainly not something I believe. I think it comes down to the dark comedy and the strong script, coupled with excellent performances from Norton and Pitt. This is a cool world to experience, but I wouldn't want to live in it.<br /><br />The story seems perfectly traditional at first. We see Norton on a plane. He's referred to as The Narrator in the credits and seems to think of himself as Jack. He encounters Tyler Durden (Pitt) and takes his business card. Jack returns home to find that there's been an explosion in his apartment, so he calls Durden and eventually asks to stay at his house for a while. Durden is a cheerful, carefree lunatic who wants Jack to punch him. The two fight on the street and decide to recruit members and form Fight Club, believing that it's an expression of freedom.<br /><br />Jack spends his free time visiting support groups. We see him hugging people with testicular cancer and all manner of diseases. He enjoys letting his inhibitions go and listening to the members speak about their illnesses. After a while, he becomes aware of Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). Like him, she's a tourist visiting the various support groups. He confronts her and they agree to attend different classes.<br /><br />Durden encourages Jack to stop trying to live up to the expectations of other people. As a result, Jack becomes more assertive. He challenges the authority of his boss and stops worrying about his appearance and the latest IKEA catalog. He regularly shows up for work with fresh cuts and bruises. Jack finds that he enjoys his new image. One thing he doesn't like is Durden forming a relationship with Marla.<br /><br />Fight Club is set in a gritty world and makes the viewer feel unclean while watching it. Fincher is good at creating unsettling worlds and this one is similar to those found in The Game and Se7en. Durden's house appears derelict and the neighborhood is seedy. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Durden has a purpose for starting Fight Club. The recruits are assigned tasks to disrupt society and members can come from any occupational background. It's like a secret society.<br /><br />Fight Club contains a major twist and I won't reveal it for those who haven't ever seen the movie. The twist elevates the movie to a different level. Subsequent viewings are enhanced because you'll notice little details you may have missed the first time. It's clever how everything ties together. The ending annoys some viewers, but it works perfectly for me. The final sequence is set to one of my favorite Pixies' songs and is probably my favorite scene in the entire movie.<br /><br />Although it's not an action movie, Fight Club is a pure adrenaline rush. From the opening credits set to the pounding beat of the Dust Brothers, it rarely lets up until the relative calm of the closing scene.<br /><br />I'm enjoying this project and got more out of Fight Club on yesterday's viewing than I ever have before.

From the opening credits set to the pounding beat of the Dust Brothers, it rarely lets up until the relative calm of the closing scene.<br /><br />I'm enjoying this project and got more out of Fight Club on yesterday's viewing than I ever have before. Just don't go out and copy the behavior it depicts.
B000009HF2|5.0|My favorite live album and a top CD favorite of all time. After listening to this album, then CD, then Live DVD from Detroit, for what seems like over 100 times, I finally saw Frampton live in Philadelphia 2/2012. He was on his 35th anniversary tour and was better than ever. Just amazing. He played for 3 hours, played the entire Comes Alive album first, then other newer songs. Sad to say, with his passing, no more Bob Mayo (\\"Bob Mayo on the keyboards, Bob Mayo\\"), but the guys in the band were great. I have wanted to see him live since 1976 when this first came out. If you have a chance to see him live, do it!

B001PA0FF4|5.0|Doubt (2008)<br />Drama, 104 minutes<br />Directed by John Patrick Shanley<br />Starring Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis<br /><br />Here's a film that I never expected to watch. The trailer looks boring and depressing and the subject matter isn't something that I would expect to hold my attention.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />The screenplay provides the foundation for a great film, and I don't use that word lightly, but what really elevates Doubt is the superb performances from the cast. Meryl Streep is utterly convincing as Sister Aloysius Beauvier. I can't imagine anyone else in the role. The students must have been terrified of her. My school had someone just like that. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a very convincing priest. When the two finally clash in a war of words, it's one of the most breathtaking confrontations I have ever seen. Amy Adams has never been better and I wish she would choose to do more serious roles. Viola Davis made a brief appearance, but I will never forget it.<br /><br />I'm tempted to say that Streep was robbed of another Oscar, but Kate Winslet was brilliant in The Reader. Hoffman was never going to eclipse Heath Ledger, but his performance shouldn't be forgotten.<br /><br />Doubt is all about the dialogue. It's also subtle. We are never told the complete truth and it's left up to us to decide whether Father Flynn (Hoffman) is guilty or innocent. This is writing at its best. The other thing that is perfectly depicted is the setting. I felt as if I had been transported back to the 1960s.<br /><br />This is the kind of film that makes you want to find out more about the actors. I found myself seeking out other work by the cast. Have you seen the film? If you have, did you think Father Flynn was guilty or innocent?

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Stands on it's own as a supremely well done tv series. The sets are beautiful and for the readers will fulfill your \\"eyes picture\\" of  what the lands in GOT should look like. The characters are all real people that are never caricatures of evil or good. The dialogue is well done and like the pace of the show it is never boring. I am not one for writing reviews but must say this series truly deserves praise. I am a huge fan of the books and was honestly expecting disappointment like in so many book to tv/movie adaptations of the past and must say I was pleasantly wrong. If you like the books you'll love this series, but I believe you'll love it without ever having touched the novels (though I highly recommend them too!).
1401937519|4.0|I couldn't wait to read this book after hearing Wayne Dyer talking about it and speaking with Anita on his Hay House Radio show, and I was very grateful to get an advance copy. It is an amazing story and a comfort to me, to have validation of what we really are and what happens when we die. Maybe I would have found it even more compelling had I not already heard her story. Maybe it was because that's how I heard it first, but I found the verbal telling of it more potent than reading it. Anita writes adequately but the words don't sing with richness and depth, which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. Five for the message, four for the delivery of it. In describing the indescribable, it would come in handy to be a better writer. That said, I have many highlighted passages and much to think about. Thank you Anita and Wayne!
B004FHCH96|5.0|Memento (2000)<br />Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 113 minutes<br />Directed by Christopher Nolan<br />Starring Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss<br /><br />\\"What's the last thing you remember?\\"<br />\\"My wife...dying.\\"<br /><br />I remember watching Memento on cable and buying it a few days later. It was such an original way of telling a story that I was excited to show it to my friends at the earliest opportunity.<br /><br />They hated it.<br /><br />The opening scene shows Leonard Shelby (Pearce) killing Teddy (Pantoliano), but that scene is actually how the story ends. Leonard suffered a head injury when his wife was murdered by intruders and hasn't been able to form short-term memories since the event. He remembers everything up to that point, such as who he is and what he did for a living, but can't build new memories.<br /><br />What would it be like to wake up every day and wonder where you were? What are you supposed to be doing that day?<br /><br />In order to place the viewer in a similar position, Nolan tells the story in reverse. We see events unfold and new information is introduced each time. The information changes our perceptions of the events we have already seen and the people we have already met. Who can Leonard trust? How can he keep the information readily available if he's going to forget everything?<br /><br />Nolan actually tells two stories. One is in black and white and proceeds in normal chronological order. This tells the story of Leonard's life before the accident. He worked as an insurance investigator and one of the claimants, Sammy Jankis, had the same problem with his memory. A tattoo on Leonard's wrist tells him to remember Sammy Jankis, and he's able to because it happened before he suffered the head injury.<br /><br />A second story shows Leonard's hunt for his wife's murderer. This time, Nolan tells it in color and uses reverse chronological order.<br /><br />Are you with me so far? Good.<br /><br />You can see why my friends hated the film. It requires patience and your full attention to understand what is going on. Furthermore, Leonard is an unreliable narrator, so we can't trust everything. Nolan presumably did this to show that Leonard can't trust his own thoughts.<br /><br />In order to function at all, Leonard employs a series of devices to aid his memory. He also sticks to a routine as much as possible. He takes photos of his car, his motel, and people he meets. As he finds out information about people, he writes notes on the photos.<br /><br />Teddy is either a crooked cop, a complete liar, or both. He claims to be helping Leonard look for his wife's killer, but he makes several attempts to borrow Leonard's car. When you see the closing scenes, you'll understand what his true motive may be.<br /><br />Natalie (Moss) is also claiming to help Leonard by providing information. Unfortunately, she also has motives of her own.<br /><br />Leonard doesn't know who to trust. He also doesn't know how long he's been trying to avenge his wife's death. Because of the nature of the narrative, we aren't even sure that Leonard hasn't already killed the murderer at some point in the past. Are Teddy or Natalie using him for some other purpose? Are they even who they say they are?<br /><br />I've seen Memento at least twice a year since I first saw it. It has endless replay value and it's interesting to see some of the events unfold when you know the outcome. Nolan gets the little details right as well as the big ones. Notice how Leonard forgets which way the motel door opens and how he brushes his hand against a glass in a restaurant because he's forgotten that he put it there.<br /><br />Each time I watch a Nolan movie I think it's the best thing he has ever done. Whether it's The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige, or Memento, he treats his audience with respect. Rather than spell out every little aspect of the story, he allows the audience to draw its own conclusion. That alienates someviewers, as it did with my friends, but the payoff is worth it if you are willing to pay full attention.viewers, as it did with my friends, but the payoff is worth it if you are willing to pay full attention.

0553582461|3.0|I don't usually provide a written review for books that I have read, just give them stars based on my opinion.  I am a great fan of Robin Hobb, and have greatly enjoyed all of her books and this is not a comment on writing style,, content, conclusion of a series etc.,it is a comment on the editing of this book.  Maybe I have been too engrossed in the story in her previous books because I have not noticed glaring editing discrepancies in them, but in this book I have.  For example - when Fitz (Tom), Web, Swift and Thick are at the cottage Wuislington (Elliania's homeland) Riddle comes and tells Fitz, Web and Swift that Dutiful needs them at the \\"motherhouse\\" and he will stay with Thick.  A few pages later, in the motherhouse, the guard formation, including Fitz, were to move aside and Riddle, who is supposed to be with Thick, nudges Fitz.  Obviously Riddle cannot be in two places at one time - editing???
B00003CX9S|5.0|The Elephant Man (1980)<br />Drama, Biography, 124 minutes<br />Directed by David Lynch<br />Starring Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt and John Gielgud<br /><br />Here's a film that I was completely wrong about when I first saw it. I was about 20 at the time and was probably watching it to see how grotesque the main character appeared. Now, some 30 years later, David Lynch has become one of my favorite directors and I am able to appreciate movies on a different level.<br /><br />The Elephant Man is not a typical David Lynch film. You can clearly see his style all over it (such as his fascination with machinery), but the story is not as complex and difficult as later efforts; this is grounded in reality. John Merrick (Hurt) existed in Victorian England, although he was really called Joseph Merrick. A cast of his head exists and is on display in a museum with his curved spine. It took up to six hours in makeup to transform Hurt into Merrick, but the result was as authentic as possible.<br /><br />Shot in black and white on a low budget in around 14 weeks, the film was made thanks to the backing of Mel Brooks. He hadn't heard of David Lynch, but backed him after seeing a screening of Eraserhead.<br /><br />The most surprising thing about The Elephant Man is how human the character is. Although his outward appearance frightened many people, he is portrayed as a gentle and eloquent man. Imagine being displayed in carnivals as a freak for the first 20 years of your life. He is punished if he doesn't \\"perform\\" and is treated like an annoying animal. Would you be afraid to speak or show your intelligence in such a situation? I know I would.<br /><br />Merrick is discovered by Frederick Treves (Hopkins), who is a surgeon in a London hospital. His initial motivation is to display Merrick to his fellow colleagues to further his career, but he soon realizes that Merrick is a human being. One of the most interesting things about the film is how society reacts to Merrick once he has the backing of a few well-known people. Unfortunately, there are still those who wish to profit from his appearance.<br /><br />The Elephant Man is one of the most emotional stories I have ever seen. I'm so glad that my tastes evolved to the point where I could see it the way it was intended. It's heartbreaking in places and you could make the argument that it's Lynch's best film (although I wouldn't agree). The cast delivers perfect performances across the board. You'll see performances from John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Freddie Jones, Michael Elphick and Hannah Gordon.<br /><br />Lynch was relatively unknown in 1980, but he produced a film that was widely admired. Although it was poorly marketed, it received eight Oscar nominations. If you enjoy emotional stories about the human condition, you won't be disappointed.e backing of a few well-known people.

B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Amelie (2001)<br />Comedy, Fantasy, Romance<br />122 minutes, French Language<br />Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet<br />Starring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz<br /><br />Several of my favorite directors produce movies which have a distinct feel, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of them. He can take the darkest topics and infuse them with his own brand of humor. Amelie is not one of his darker films, but it feels like part of his familiar world.<br /><br />The star of Amelie is Audrey Tautou and she shines in the role. The movie isn't serious at all and is filled with amusing stories and delivered in a whimsical way. We are introduced to the characters by a narrator who tells us their likes and dislikes. I love the use of narration when it's done well.<br /><br />Amelie is a young woman who accidentally discovers a box of childhood treasures left hidden in her apartment by a previous tenant. She decides to track him down to return it and resolves to do similar good deeds if the outcome is favorable. She's not completely good though. One person in particular annoys her so she decides to play a few pranks to teach him a lesson.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of mystery and eventually turns into an unconventional romance. The color scheme places an emphasis on red and green and the world seems surreal. The setting is Paris, but this isn't the Paris that I know from my visits.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is an incredible actress. She can convey a lot of emotion without saying a word. Her face is one of the most expressive that I have seen. If you have only seen her in The Da Vinci Code, Amelie is a great chance to see her act in her native language.<br /><br />I know people who would avoid seeing Amelie because it's in French and it's a romance. That would be a mistake. The movie is a pure delight and has a unique style. It won't appeal to everyone, but those who like it will really love it.

B005UKJX4E|4.0|After watching the movie, I can understand why it was nominated for an Oscar, but I can also understand why it's had such a negative commercial response.<br /><br />Every scene is visually stunning, especially the footage of natural phenomena.<br /><br />Acting was great by all parties involved, but I want to specially recognize the main boy actor, who transformed from an innocent, mischievous child to an malicious, angsty teen, torn between the innocence he knew as a child (represented by his mother) and the realities of adulthood (represented by his father). His expressions and movements embodied a mix of guilt, confusion, happiness, anger, etc. at all times. His younger brother was also a great child actor. Completely innocent and resolutely choosing the to do the right thing, not out of naivety, but because he's comfortable with giving up the top dog position for a life of grace.<br /><br />The director also did a fantastic job of creating a certain transcendental ambience through lighting, the soundtrack,  and whispered prayers throughout the movie.<br /><br />HOWEVER, to be honest, I wondered if all the fanciness was necessary. It felt a little overdramatic at times, but I think it's just a matter of personal taste. It can feel a bit slow though, especially for people looking for more plot-driven movies,  but otherwise the content and the form of the movie were great.

B000MCH5TK|5.0|Babel (2006)<br />Drama, 143 minutes<br />Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu<br />Starring Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Rinko Kikuchi<br /><br />Nominated for seven Oscars and winning for best score, Babel is a sprawling tale of how a gun links four separate groups of people. Pitt and Blanchett are the focus of one of the stories, but the other three are probably more compelling.<br /><br />The film will take you to Morocco, the US, Mexico and Japan. It deals with themes such as love, loneliness, adolescence, the law, and kindness. It amazes me how people who have almost nothing will still give you something.<br /><br />The appeal of Babel for me is the way in which Inarritu weaves the complex threads together to create a believable and enthralling story. Many of the actors were unknown to me, but I wasn't disappointed with any of the performances. It's hard to watch this film and not be moved emotionally by at least one of the stories; I was moved by all four.

B002LFAHBO|4.0|Love Actually (2003)<br />Comedy, Drama, Romance, 135 minutes<br />Directed by Richard Curtis<br />Starring Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Liam Neeson<br /><br />Here's a movie that works for Valentines Day, Christmas, or date night. But unlike most of the offerings for those occasions, Love Actually is both smart and funny. The reason it works so well is the writing and the acting. Richard Curtis is genuinely witty and knows what these actors are capable of. Although the movie is long at 135 minutes, I usually find myself wishing it lasted a little bit longer.<br /><br />Most romantic comedies tell the story of one couple or two at the outside. Love Actually contains too many relationships to count and it doesn't restrict itself to romantic love. You'll also find the love between friends and family members. Some new relationships are formed, while others weaken.<br /><br />There are so many good actors involved. Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister and he's not in a relationship, but soon finds that he likes a member of his staff. Colin Firth plays a writer who sees his marriage threatened when his wife has an affair, but unexpectedly finds new love. Laura Linney's character has been in love with a work colleague for years, but has never acted on it. Her reasons eventually become clear and illustrate another kind of love.<br /><br />My favorite relationship is the one between Daniel (Neeson) and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Daniel's wife has recently died, leaving him to raise Sam. He worries that Sam spends too much time in his room, but eventually learns what the problem is. The relationship between the two is so warm and honest that it's almost impossible not to root for Sam as he attempts to resolve his problem. It leads to some of the funniest scenes in the movie.<br /><br />You'll also find plenty of other good performances from the likes of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Martine McCutcheon.<br /><br />Not everything turns out perfectly for the couples involved. Some face threats to their happiness and not all of them can be completely resolved to their satisfaction. Love Actually examines love and the many forms it can come in. Some of the situations reach the expected conclusion and many are uplifting. A few are even surprising. I've just never seen a movie attempt to keep so many romantic threads alive throughout the running time. Against all odds, it somehow keeps us invested in the outcome of all the story threads by continually updating the progress of each.<br /><br />According to my friends, I watch so many sad or depressing movies, but here's one that will lift your spirits. The opening scenes show how people allow their real emotions to show when they meet their loved ones at airports. That's essentially what Love Actually is about. To enjoy it fully, you'll need to allow your own emotions to show.erfectly for the couples involved.

030788743X|4.0|When i say that this book's only real purpose is to tick every 80s nostalgia checkbox on the list, i'm not trying to insult the book. It's a good book. I enjoyed it. But it's hard to avoid the fact that the plot is pretty simplistic and rife with tropes, and that the characters, while compelling and well-drawn, are pretty standard.<br /><br />The enjoyment in reading this book isn't from the plot twists and turns, nor is it from the character development. The fun had while devouring this well-written novel is from coasting along behind the plot giggling at all the crazy stuff we thought was normal in the 80s, or saying, 'Oh my gosh, i remember that game!' when some obscure ancient computer game is the latest step on the protagonist's journey.<br /><br />If you thought the 80s were stupid or embarrassing, or if you don't understand why anyone would be afraid of grues, you probably won't really like this book. If you want a simple story done very, very well, with lots of in-jokes for the computer/gaming crowd, then buy this book immediately.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|Streep's performance was superb, which rightfully earned her an Academy Award in her portrayal of The Iron Lady in her twilight. The film was a contrast between Thatcher's mental decline in her old age with her iron determination against a phalanx of \\"good ole boys---no women allowed,\\" Argentinian dictators, Soviet dictators, IRA terrorists and leftist psychopaths. Contrary to so much leftist propaganda and caricature (no to mention historical falsehoods),Thatcher did so much good for Britain and we only get a glimpse of it---and that glimpse is not very detailed and ever so brief. I understand the movie's emphasis and its accurate portrayal, but there was so much more that they could have focused on instead. Maybe some day we will get a full treatment of her career; that will be an awesome movie.

And a Alien Species from out space.<br />This movie is very MODERN. Very REALISTIC, in words and also in they way the actors dress.<br />And funny thing is I usually can't understand what British people are saying, but this movie will have you<br />so engrossed in whats going on u will hear every word and laugh and feel the moments in the movie.<br />The music in this FILM is just amazing, just as amazing as how imaginative the Alien creatures look, I mean really when you<br />think about ALIENS from outtaspace could look like anything. And it so works for the Apartment complex the film takes place at.<br />My favorite movies are TRON LEGACY and TERMINATOR 1  but this movie lol is funny but has so much action it has to be on my list as my 3rd favorite movie of all time. I like how the film has a feeling of us versus them.<br />There is even two little kid actors in it who have great lines.<br />WHAT A MOVIE !!! RENT THIS cuz when u do you will want to BUY it.<br />Man I think if the Britain/London could do what CANADA has done with their MUSIC talent, they could maybe be big competition for HOLLYWOOD, cuz I always see lots of good British actors in Hollywood films/TV.<br />Anywayz this movie is dope if u love HIPHOP or even if you HATE it. This movie has a way of bridging that gap somewhat.

0545091020|5.0|I might just be the last person on the planet to read The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins' 2008 post-apocalyptic YA dystopian science fiction novel. After my wife raving about it, and with the movie coming up next month, I finally got to it, and I loved it. So if I was not, in fact, the last person to start this series and you haven't checked it out yet, read on to find out why you ought to read it as well.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a 16 year old girl in District 12, a coal-mining town in the country of Panem. She supports her family after her father died in mining accident several years before the events of the novel by illegally hunting in the nearby forests. Each year, as punishment for an uprising long ago, the Capitol randomly selects a one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 from each of the twelve districts to participate in the Hunger Games, an arena death match where only one contestant can survive. When her 12 year old sister Prim is selected, Katniss volunteers to take her place.<br /><br />Collins artfully crafts an exciting story that fires on all cylinders. Action? I mentioned \\"post-apocalyptic arena death match,\\" right? Romance? More than covered. Compelling protagonist? Katniss is fantastic. She's strong, tough, determined, loyal, but she still has many of the normal concerns of a teenager, and flaws that make her believable. Interesting setting? Very much so. I devoured every bit about the world and wondered about what it implied for the larger setting, eager to find out more about what this unfortunate world is like and how it came to be.<br /><br />I've read several other dystopian novels - 1984, Brave New World, Cloud Atlas - and The Hunger Games fits right there alongside them, despite it's YA target audience and teen protagonist. I was amazed at how grim Collins could get and still manage to keep things YA. It actually reminded me some of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson such as Treasure Island, which can be challenging and have complex characters and violence, but still be appropriate for the younger reader. We seem to be living in a golden age of YA fiction that adults can enjoy, with Collins, J.K. Rowling, Scott Westerfeld and others crossing over to adult audiences with their excellent YA novels.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version, read by Carolyn McCormick. McCormick does an excellent job narrating the novel. She manages to convey the tension well, and her different accents and male voices are strong.<br /><br />As I said, I'm probably the last person to read The Hunger Games. But if not, if someone out there reads this review and hasn't read The Hunger Games yet, do so now. It's a great book, and I can't wait to keep reading and find out what happens in the rest of the trilogy.ters and violence, but still be appropriate for the younger reader.

0307352145|1.0|This book is touted as a work that explores the valuable contribution introverts can make in a society that does not value them. Instead, this book was more of a treatise on how introverts should fake being extroverts to get ahead and compete in a society that overvalues the extrovert. In other words, it tells introverts to live a lie.  In addition, the author's example of ordinary people included only people trying to make it in the corporate and business environments, shedding no light at all about the majority of introverts who do not aspire to being \\"successful\\" in these environments. Instead of celebrating the introvert, the book in the end is an example of how introverts are not valued and should concentrate on  \\"fitting in\\". As a lifetime introvert, I found this book offensive.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is an excellent timekiller. the graphics are great and it is, though repetitive, a crazy awesome thing to play when you're bored. the challenges are slightly frustrating and I would like more skins, but other than that no problem.
B00005UT85|5.0|I would strongly recommend this LP to any ardent progressive rock listener.  Especially if or after they have heard their other two earliest LPs-- If I Could Do It All Over Again and In The Land Of Grey and Pink.  It is a hidden gem(as well as the aforementioned other two) that was well under-rated back in it's day as well as being ahead of it's time (alike the TV-series Star Trek).  The wah-wah hooked up tonewheel organ of Dave Sinclair is one example of this, among other characteristics such as the reverberated and airy vocals of Pye Hastings and Richard Sinclair.<br />This album marks Caravan at their most youthful and most distinquished sound. A must-have for any progrock connoisseur that has listened to earliest-period Pink Floyd(w/Sid Barrett at the forefront), and later-period Beatles.  Caravan has been one of the very rare and hidden bands to help define the psychedelic contribution that the UK had brought to the psychedelic 60's.<br /><br />There is also a great \\"sing-a-long, and folk\\" flavor to this album that makes the songs simple to sing along with for those that are into basic, less complex dance-rock forms.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Within the last decade there has been no shortage of full-length concert DVDs from Canadian progressive rock supergroup Rush. There was \\"Rush in Rio\\" in 2003, \\"R30\\" in 2005, and \\"Snakes & Arrows Live\\" in 2008, as well as 2011's feature-length documentary, \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\", produced by filmmakers/Rush fans Sam Dunn & Scott McFadyen and their company Banger Productions (VH-1 Classics' Metal Evolution, \\"Iron Maiden: Flight 666\\", \\"Metal: A Headbangers Journey\\".) It's a testament to Dunn & McFadyen's camaraderie with the band that when the time came to document this 2011 performance at the Quickens Loans Arena in Cleveland Ohio, the job went to them. It's a good thing, too. While I've been impressed in varying degrees with all of the aforementioned concert DVDs (\\"Snakes and Arrows Live\\", in particular) I must say that this new DVD seems to be better filmed, with more of an eye towards detail. From close-up views of Alex Lifeson's guitar techniques, to Neil Peart's feet stomping out a particularly tricky bass pedal rhythm, to all the set pieces, visual jokes and video screen presentations - it's pretty obvious that this was produced by people who know and love the music.<br /><br />Now, for a band with so many live DVDs on the market, does \\"Time Machine\\" offer anything that Rush fans haven't seen and heard before? For those who care about Rush beyond just their 'greatest hits', the answer is definitely yes. One thing that makes Rush's live shows superior to many other bands still surviving from the 70s and 80s is that Rush actually shakes-up their set-list a bit from tour to tour. Of course they don't (and shouldn't) leave out  their most well-known FM radio staples (Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Closer To the Heart, Working Man), but for this tour they even went a step further, including a complete performance of their most popular album, 1980's \\"Moving Pictures\\". For fans of that particular album, the performances and visual presentation of these classic tracks are all top-notch and alone worth the price of the DVD - particularly the showstopping rendition of \\"The Camera Eye\\", which easily surpasses the power of the studio version. But, believe it or not, the 'hits' only makes up about half of this 3 hour show. For me, and I suspect a lot of other Rush fans, the real treat with these marathon concert  DVDs is hearing some of the newer material live, and finding out which lesser-known album tracks from the past will get dusted-off for rediscovery. Keeping with the \\"Time Machine\\" theme, the set-list is cobbled-together from all of the band's various eras or \\"phases\\". \\"2112 Overture/Temples of Syrinx\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" represent  a taste of the 70's 'concept album' period, which no doubt ushered many-a-proghead onto the Rush bandwagon. The 80s 'synthesizer' period is nicely-represented here  by \\"Time Stand Still\\", \\"Marathon\\" (a personal favorite of mine) and powerful \\"Subdivisions\\", which serves as an emotional climax to the opening set. The title track from 1989's \\"Presto\\" is an unexpected (but very welcome) inclusion, providing a subdued contrast to the show's heavier moments. From 1993's \\"Counterparts\\" we get the tasty instrumental workout \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\", featuring some wonderfully nimble-fingered bass work from Geddy Lee, as well as a raucous rendition of \\"Stick It Out\\" which rates as one of my favorite performances on the entire DVD. 2007's \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is represented by a trio of tracks, \\"\\"Workin' Them Angels\\", \\"Far Cry\\", & \\"Faithless\\". All of them come across excellent in the live setting, but \\"Faithless\\" is a particular treat as it's wasn't included on the DVD of the \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" tour. There are also two nods to the future with \\"BU2B\\" and \\"Caravan\\", previews from the band's next album \\"Clockwork Angels\\", due in 2012. Both tracks are incrediblely gripping live, and are full to the brim with monster heavy riffs and dark atmosphere - proving that Rush's post-70's output has not always as \\"soft\\" as some of the band's critics like to claim.<br /><br />While much could be said about the huge stage production found here (with video screens, explosions, towers of flames, comedic film skits, and even a guy in a chicken suit), the real 'show' comes from the three musicians themselves. Their on-stage energy, whether clowning around or intensely absorbed in a musical moment, is palpable and a true joy to behold. At a time when many  other vintage bands only seem to tolerate each other for the sake of money, it's obvious that Lee, Peart and Lifeson are still friends with a lot of mutual respect for one another.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, their are two sound-mixes to choose from - 2.1 Stereo or DTS. I don't have a DTS system, so can't comment on that version, but the ordinary stereo mix sounds quite full and dynamic, whether using headphones or speakers. However, I must sat that the previous DVD, \\"Snakes and Arrows Live\\", had a clearer 'separation' effect when listened to with headphones - at least to my ears.<br /><br />All in all, this DVD should not be missed by anyone who calls themselves a Rush fan, and it certainly whets the appetite for the new album,  coming later this year.t\\" as some of the band's critics like to claim.<br /><br />While much could be said about the huge stage production found here (with video screens, explosions, towers of flames, comedic film skits, and even a guy in a chicken suit), the real 'show' comes from the three musicians themselves.

0811875040|2.0|To make chocolate buttercream, you're supposed to add 1/4 cup ganache from a recipe that makes 3 cups! And to make vanilla macarons, you need 1 1/2 cups vanilla buttercream from a 6-cup recipe that has 5 egg whites. I don't know how to cut that down by a quarter! And then the cake recipes are for 6-inch, 7-inch, and 8-inch pans. Who has all those sizes?!? This feels like lazy recipe writing -- restaurant/bakery cookbook authors should take the time to make their recipes user friendly for the home chef/baker. I love the Miette bakeries around town, and the book is definitely pretty, but I look forward to a second edition (not just a corrected printing) that makes the recipes work as well as the nice photography, design, and fancy printing.

0307957934|5.0|The Fear Index,written by novelist Robert Harris, is an engaging, thrill-a-minute ride through the world of high finance.  Alex Hoffmann, the novel's protagonist, is a U.S. expat and former CERN researcher-turned-high finance expert who has created an AI program that predicts what's going to happen in the world's financial markets with an eerie, almost unheard of level of accuracy, and a hedge fund that makes money hand over fist.  But when an intruder breaks into his lakeside home one morning and assaults him, Hoffmann finds himself in a race to find out just who it is that is setting him up for a big fall.<br /><br />When I first got this book I was expecting a taut, hammer-at-your-senses thriller, and I am pleased to say that it has met and exceeded those expectations, from the first word to the last period.  I hope that it will do the same for others who chance to read it.
B002U4UZUE|5.0|This review is for the Werner Bros 180g audiphile anolog reissue vinyl.  What can I say Dire Straits orginal classic is back in 180g and never sounded better.  Light years beyond the orginal pressing, the sound is full of life. I love the sound of the drums/percussion, you can actually hear the echo/rumbling of the drums after there struck.  The guitars are very crisp and sound so clear.  This pressing is the best avaiable by far.  It is however out of print from Warner Bros. so if you find it expect to pay quite a bit of doe. (I Did).  My favorite tracks on the album are Lions, The Gallery, Water Of Love, and of course their all time classic SULTANS OF SWING!  This is were it all begins!

B004BC7MRM|3.0|Kid Rock is 40+ now, growing up, and feeling his age. This album is cathartic and therapeutic for him. It's a stunning departure from his previous records, after which you usually had to scrape your brains off the ceiling. As an album, \\"Born Free\\" is heavily influenced by the country-rock of Bob Seger and Lynyrd Skynyrd. It's mostly catchy, feel-good tunes about slowing down, reclaiming your sanity and listening to family advice \\"so I can live to see 50.\\" It's a good thing, because his pipes are heavily damaged from the last 15 years of screaming into the mic. His voice is gravelly and gritty on this album of easy country tunes, but it all works. Bob Seger, Cheryl Crow and a gospel choir even join in on a few of the songs.<br />  I've always admired Kid Rock, especially after the USS Cole bombing and how he came to the Norfolk Scope arena and sang a benefit concert for the victim's families. He's a good man.<br />  Once I got past the weirdness of Kid Rock actually singing, I sat back and enjoyed this album. \\"Care\\" has been stuck in my head for the last three days.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Really enjoyed the concert.  I think one of the reviews I read before purchasing complained STRONGLY that the quick editing cuts were annoying to the point of ruining the concert experience.  I was worried about this but purchased anyway.  I don't think the complaint is justified.  That reviewer needs to relax a little.  Sound quality is excellent. My only regret is not buying the blu ray version (and I blame the above mentioned reviewer for my decision to save a few bucks for fear of not liking all the \\"rapid cuts\\" and other negative comments. By the way, this was a birthday present for my wife and she loved both the DVD and CD.

0761169253|5.0|With this book I think Austin Kleon created exactly the book he wanted to make--an easily digested, hard-hitting set of ideas to help spark creativity and lead a sane life while doing so.  I especially enjoyed his section \\"use your hands\\", in which he describes the importance of using \\"analog\\" tools before throwing everything onto a computer, where we tend to get very edit-minded.  As a musician I found this incredibly true.  If I jump from the piano to the computer too quickly, I'll get stuck editing the first piano part before I finish the dang song.  No matter your medium, this book is filled with ideas that you'll read and think to yourself \\"wow, that definitely applies to me\\".  Doesn't feel short on content but easy to read in a sitting.  Great buy!
1416955070|4.0|I loved, loved, loved City of Bones. It's completely engaging and one of my favourite YA reads. City of Bones is a well-written story of a normal young woman, Clary, who finds out that her world and herself are anything but ordinary. After a night out at a club, Clary is thrown into a world of demons, vampires, werewolves, and hunters.<br /><br />I love the characters. Jace and his snarky-ness, which hides a softer interior. Isabelle so snooty and hard to connect with. Alec brooding and quiet, who harbours a secret. Clary our brave heroine who is about to have her world changed, to nerdy Simon who is still unsure of himself?<br /><br />City of bones is an Urban Fantasy novel, packed with action, friendship, love, loyalty, and betrayal. The unexpected twists will leave you wanting more.<br />This is a must read for urban fantasy and paranormal romance fans!

1612130283|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey can only be described as an intensely dark romance. The characters and story are well crafted and had me unable to put the book down. Christian Grey is stunningly gorgeous, extremely wealthy and always in control. Though deep down, Grey is a tortured and tormented individual. The controlled façade he has built starts to crumble when naïve Anastasia Steele stumbles into his office.<br /><br />From the get-go Christian is mesmerised by Ana and wants a relationship with her badly. Though Christian's idea of a relationship is nothing, Ana could ever have dreamt up. Ana has a tough time coming to terms with Christian's need to control and certain aspects of his lifestyle. A lifestyle that is... filled with mystery, intrigue and darkness, quite a lot of darkness.<br /><br />I love how E.L. James portrays Christian. It could have been very easy to dislike Christian, yet there was something about James's depiction of him that makes me all hot and bothered. I love how he can be brooding and scary then; a switch is flipped, and he is completely romantic. If you love a tortured hero, then Christian is your man! He has a dark and horrible past that will leave you heart-broken for him.<br /><br />There isn't one thing I didn't love about this book. Not one thing. I love the chemistry between Christian and Ana and the journey, they and their relationship is on. Although this has some kinky sex going on it wasn't to kinky. I love this book from beginning to end, and I'm already moving on to Fifty Shades Darker.

1595141979|4.0|Shadow Kiss is the 3rd book in the \\"Vampire Academy\\" series.<br />I enjoyed this novel immensely. Each novel in this series continues the story and gets better and better.<br /><br />This book is set right before Lissa and Rose are due to graduate, they are in their last semester at St. Vladimir's Academy. Both have a lot of things going on.<br /><br />Rose is still trying to deal with her forbidden love for. She is starting to feel resentment towards Lissa after watching her being so happy and in love with Christian while knowing that she and Dimitri will never be able to be together. But that isn't the only thing going on with Rose; she is getting increasingly angry over the smallest of things and can't understand why her temper is so out of control. When she starts seeing ghosts she really does start to think that she is losing her mind.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the last 2 books in the series then you're going to love Shadow Kiss.<br /><br />This book will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride like no other you've been on before. I won't give any spoilers so I'm just going to say the ending will leave you gasping - the twist at the end is heartbreaking and I have no idea how she is going to be able to fix things to my satisfaction.
B0076D20E8|2.0|I did not like this film.  This is of course a matter of personal opinion.  The cast was wonderful, the settings were lush and the costumes were fabulous.  I am not a fan of presenting speculation as fact.  I do love sci fi and fantasy and alternative history but not in this format.  What ever happened to presenting history as fact?
1613821409|4.0|Little Women was first published in 1868 as two volumes and was an instant success. The novel concerns the lives and loves of four sisters growing up during the American Civil War. Beautiful Meg, tomboy Jo, serene Beth, and selfish Amy are based on Alcott's own experiences with her three sisters.<br /><br />Little Women has such a sweet feel to it. The characters are all so real, each with their own personalities that jump off the page. They make you care deeply about what happens to them. It's lovely to see how they struggle with their own and each other's flaws.<br /><br />Little women is overall a wonderful classic. If you can look past the preachy-ness that the book has at times you will find that you enjoy a simple story about women, sisters, friendships and life.

0486284735|5.0|This is considered the Jane Austen masterpiece and is one of the most popular books of English literature and I can see why. Jane Austen paints a gorgeous picture of what life for a woman in 19th century England was like. Her characters are beautifully developed and the main character Elizabeth is how I would hope I would be if I lived in that era. Smart, a freethinker and not afraid to show little gumption.<br /><br />This is one book that I will read again and again throughout my lifetime. I can't recommend it enough.

1416972242|4.0|City of Ashes is the second instalment in The Mortal Instruments series, a young adult urban fantasy series set in New York.<br /><br />When a young warlock, werewolf and fae child are found murdered and drained of blood, the Underworlders are convinced it is the work of the vampires, but they claim it is not them. What everyone soon learns is that Valentine has managed to steal a sword, which is another of the Mortal Instruments, and he needs the blood of all downworlder races to activate a spell that will help him take down the Clave. It's up to Clary, Jace and their friends to stop him before Valentine and posse destroy them all.<br /><br />After the last explosive and personally upsetting ending of the first book I could only hope that this book would correct that. Unfortunately I was left with many more questions by the end.<br /><br />Clary and Jace are struggling with how they feel about each, Alec is struggling with how everyone will react to his sexuality, Isobel is still Isobel and Simon... Simon ends up with the \\"short end of the stick.<br /><br />Sometimes the next book in a series doesn't live up to its predecessor. Not the case with City of Ashes. This book is just as well written and will have you reading the whole book in one.<br /><br />I recommend that you start with City of Bones if you haven't read it already. If you have well you won't be disappointed with the City of Ashes.

I am not saying dont get it because of that.  If you are new to the whole photoshop cs5 like I am it is very good to help you along the way.  I do like the way it is written in plain English. If you are new to PS CS5 I would suggest this for reading, and the practice exercises.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|Doesn't run well, freezes often and poor quality graphics dampen what would otherwise be a fun and addictive game. Clearly Android development is not a priority for PopCap games.

B007E6YYLO|1.0|I CANT BELIEVE THE DIRECTION THEY WENT WITH SEASON 2.<br />When i first saw Season 1 i thought that this was tahe best Show on the planet and i actually but all the episodes. I even recommended it to my friends but now sadly regret it...I agree with other comments which says that the show is Flaming Out badly. I will not buy no more show episodes. I dont even watch TV that much and now i can honestly say that im not buying no more shows. I agree with Igorr..and L P...they shouldnt have fired they star director.  Now this show is like watching ALL MY CHILDREN drama filled and less action...AMC u guys know how to ruin a good show.

B0070Z4M4I|2.0|Who goes there? I mean really who digs up one of the best cult classics EVER just to do nothing with it. John Carpenters 80's The Thing was his Sistine Chapel (I'm still not the same after seeing it and that was 20 years ago). He based his version off of the original book (if you don't know it look at my first sentence) not to be confused with the 50's popcorn sci-fi flick The Thing From Another World. Carpenter also played off of the cold war paranoia going on in the 80's. It was pure raw genius. This Thing based its premise off of every other pointless sci-fi horror flick. Hot female lead Check, Lots of violence Check and a monster check. Too bad that whole plot Thing missed them.<br />If you're going to re-make (actually a prequel) a movie then be bold and fresh about it. The Thing is neither of these which begs to question, who goes there? If it was to waste my time and make me think I could write (not to mention direct) a better movie than good show! Maybe I'm off base because after all they did get a quality script writer in Eric Heisserer (A Nightmare on Elms Street 2008 & Final Destination 5). Opps my bad I guess they didn't. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. direction was a white out void of emotion. His biggest fail was not creating that feeling that the walls were closing in on our cast.<br />The only reason to bring the Thing to the screen again would've been to give the audience another portion of what they loved about the original. This flick failed to flesh out the everyman for himself paranoia. There were no moments that were so revolting that you simply couldn't look away. It was more jack in a box scares than a total freak show that messed with your mind. The only thing messed up about The Thing prequel was how bad they messed it up.<br /><br />Acting (Ambivalent): The acting wasn't horrid. It's just none of characters were really engrossing. This was mostly due to a rushed script that gave no depth to rich characters. They traded depth of a few characters for plenty of back ground characters. Most of whom lacked a pulse. Once the killing starts it turns into, oh that guy died who was he again? Plus most emotional scenes lacked a proper response from the surrounding characters. E.g. tons of serious drama is going down around me but I'll just follow orders as if it all hasn't quite registered yet. Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) the lead scientist was poorly fleshed out and came across stale. Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) played the now overdone heroine (ever since Aliens every sci-fi horror movie does this, sorry Ripley was a one of kind). Her character was forced but she gave it a go and she's eh. Carter (Joel Edgerton; terrific actor in good movies) plays the American helicopter pilot hero (R.J. MacReady wannabe; if you didn't get that then shame on you) and he's also eh.<br /><br />Script (Yak): Pitch, lets remake a cult classic. We'll steal the title (I would have gone with \\"Who Goes There?\\" But hey that's me) and recycle what we shouldn't from the original (you know flame throwers, blizzards and tough helicopter pilots). Oh yeah and were going to have badder fast moving monsters and a few inconceivable plot twists. Sigh... the problem with this pitch is that along the way they forgot what really mattered. What made the 80's Thing great was that feeling that the walls were closing in on you. That gut check moment of if we don't stop it here the whole world is done.<br />Also Things move way too fast (this is true no matter how you take it).<br /><br />The best parts to the script were the very very very end and very very very beginning. Their method for testing if someone was the Thing was well thought out but that's really about it. Overall it's mostly just another sci-fi slasher without the gratuitous nudity (I'm not pro nudity but B slasher flicks at least know what they are and aren't). This Thing doesn't know what it is.<br /><br />My other grip is when a movie is a prequel/sequel for a universe butthey totally don't fit in that universe (most notorious offender is George Lucas). The whole premise that an American team went to the Norwegian camp was lame. We didn't need an American female lead but most importantly we didn't need any Americans. Plus the Thing at times doesn't pounce on potential victims when it could. This made no sense other than to create that big plot twist moment.<br /><br />Special Effects (Nothing Special about Digital): Special effects in the 80's looked real (Empire, Return of the Jedi, Blade Runner, The Thing, Aliens & Terminator). I appreciate what digital effects can do but they can't do quite a lot. The Thing uses them often which really mucks up the moment by taking us out it. When a monster looks fake you stop living the scene and start to analyze how silly it looks. This NEVER happened in the original. The effects fell short because they lacked the brutal nature of actual monster props, gallons of blood and puss plus the realness of hand crafted latex creepers (When they burn they look real unlike their digital cousins).<br /><br />Music (where are you): Bum bump bum bump flat line. The heart beat music wasn't here until the last scene (I think the start also but it was brief). That's the best part of the music and it wasn't even used. Wow bad call in a movie full of bad calls.<br /><br />Fin.
B004ZNANZA|4.0|My main purpose in purchasing this CD was for the bonus material.  However, the Experience Version contains three CDs, not four as stated by Amazon.  Furthermore, this edition contains twenty-seven demos on one disc, not thirty-five demos over two discs.  So, unless Amazon is selling a special edition (I did extensive research in deciding whether to purchase this or the $119 Immersion version, and did not see any mention of this anywhere), this version contains three CDs.<br /><br />Discs 1 and 2 are the 2011 James Guthrie remasters of the album.  Disc 3 contains 27 demos, all of which are \\"band\\" demos rather than Roger or David's \\"home demos.\\"  Since the demos were my main interest and reason for buying this, I will address that topic first.  The Immersion version does contain two CDs worth of demos, containing a total of 64.  Since I do not have that version, I will not address whether I am lacking anything essential by not having the 37 additional demos that appear on that version.  Based on my research I am not.  At least 22 of the 37 demos on Immersion are excerpts of Roger's home recordings totaling about 15 minutes.  Two others are David's demos of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell.\\"  Other than that, the remainder appear to be additional band demos at various stages of development, all of which appear in at least one form or another on Experience.  The actual demos themselves are titled \\"Work in Progress\\" and are aimed at giving a glimpse into how the project came to its final form.  My interest was more in hearing alternate versions of songs and the two songs that did not make the  album.  In my opinion, except for completists, the Experience version does a good job at this.  The two titles that did not make the album are \\"Teacher Teacher (later appearing as \\"The Hero's Return\\" a B side from the \\"Final Cut.\\") and \\"Sexual Revolution,\\" (later re-worked as \\"4:41 a.m.\\") from Roger's \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.\\"  The remaining 25 demos range from interesting to \\"I only need to hear this once.\\"  Probably the most interesting item here is \\"The Doctor\\" which is an early version of \\"Comfortably Numb.\\"  The sound quality of the demos varies from mediocre to passable.  In my estimation, there are probably no more than ten that are substantial and that I will listen to again.  After listening to all 27 (totaling 75:04) minutes, I cannot imagine listening to another disc of demos.  Therefore, for my purpose, I think the Experience Edition was the appropriate choice.  Please note, I am merely comparing the Immersion and Experience versions for demos.  There are numerous other reasons one might wish to purchase the 7 disc Immersion set.<br /><br />As far as the Discs 1 and 2, I will not comment on the music because it has all been said before.  The album is a classic.  The main issue here is the quality of the remastering.  I compared my copy from the \\"Shine On\\" box to this on high end equipment and honestly could not hear any dramatic difference between the two.  The 2011 remaster sounded slightly less bass heavy, slightly louder, and the vocals and drums appeared to be more upfront in the mix.  However, I had to strain to hear this and the difference was very slight.<br /><br />Like the other \\"Experience Editions\\" (\\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\"), \\"The Wall\\" is packaged in a cardboard case.  The booklet is similar to the LP in attempting to recreate the artwork and handwritten lyrics.  However, no information is provided regarding history, guest musicians, etc.<br /><br />So how do I rate this?  I give it four stars.  Five stars for Discs 1 and 2 and three stars for Disc 3.  I think it is the weakest of the three expanded albums from the series because it has the least essential bonus material.  There is also less of difference in sound quality, which is excellent, over the earlier remasters.  This is likely due to the fact it is a newer release and always had excellent fidelity.<br /><br />If you are interested in getting a new copy of \\"The Wall\\" with an extra disc of material you probably won't listen to more than a few times, this is a great purchase.  If you have either of the previous two \\"Wall\\" remasters, there is no substantial difference in sound here.  If you merely want a new copy without the extra disc, the standard 2011 remaster is the best option.  If you have the money and can spring for the Immersion Version, I would say go for it.  It is the most complete version of this classic album available at this time.  However, I do want to stress again that the Experience Version contains 3 CDs with 27 demos on Disc 3.  Anyone interested in more than this must purchase the Immersion Version.

0439023491|5.0|Ah the story continues!  It is not just an entertaining story it is truely monumental.

It is very realistically written and gets you right into the story as if you are right there.
0385342063|5.0|This was my first Sophie Kinsella read and I was absolutely charmed from the very first page.  The character of Poppy Wyatt is one that I feel most women can easily relate to.  She's flawed and insecure yet impulsive and mouthy at at once.  The author does an amazing job of capturing the realities of what we all think and feel at one time in our lives or another and imbuing Poppy with those emotions!<br /><br />The supporting cast are also a pleasant surprise running the gambit from a less that ideal fiance and in-laws, to the assortment of friends...some true...some not so true.  And the pace of the novel is perfect... keeping things moving along while peppering in moments of hilarity, reality, uncomfortability, and incredible sweetness. I was laughing non stop and enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />The budding romance that develops of all things via text messages between Poppy and Sam was incredibly sweet and somehow believable.  I think I fell a little in love with him myself as I felt so much like Poppy while reading this!<br /><br />The only downside for me were the footnotes...not that I didn't enjoy reading them, but it was a bit difficult toggling back and forth on an e-reader.  With a print copy though I feel they'd only enhance the read.<br /><br />This was an amazing delightful read that I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish and when I did I was left with only one question...<br /><br />Why in the world did I wait so long to read Sophie Kinsella??<br /><br />NOTE: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
0545425115|5.0|A friend gave me this book to read.  I was not sure what to expect.  I used to read a lot when I was a kid but not really at all until I got this book.  The unique story, edge of the seat action and wanting Katniss to survive and win--really got me hooked and into reading again. It is not so unreal that it could not happen and with the bararics of Man's past when overbearing leaders take control--it is possible in the future.  It is written well for adult reading but young enough for young adults too, I think that is what got me going is that I could read it without trouble and enjoy reading and the story.  If you are one that has never read Sci Fi or the Fantasy genre, this is a good introduction and might change your mind and stories like that.

0765350386|3.0|Great world building, and fantastic action scenes. Can't really add anything other reviewers haven't said. I just felt Vin was overpowered and am burned out on characters that are just magically good at everything :\. Since, the books look to be centering more and more on her, I think I'll stop with this one. Loved \\"The Way of Kings\\", and was hoping for more of his writing, but this trilogy just isn't for me. I still recommend reading at least the first book, as others may not be annoyed by Vin as I was :).
0399159029|5.0|The prologue of Philip Kerr's \\"Prague Fatale\\" takes place in June, 1942, following the assassination of the Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia, SS Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Reinhard Heydrich. His Nazi cohorts give Heydrich \\"the best send-off that any psychopathically murderous criminal could have hoped for,\\" wisecracks the cynical, blunt, and bitingly sarcastic Kripo detective, Bernie Gunther.  Kerr flashes back to the previous year, a bad time for the forty-three year old Gunther.  After serving in Belorussia (where he witnessed and participated in acts of appalling cruelty), he contemplates putting a bullet in his brain to end the sleepless nights and bouts of guilt that torment him.  His city is also in bad shape:  \\"Berlin felt ... like the capital of a banana republic that had run out of bananas.\\"  Staples such as meat, milk, potatoes, bread, eggs, soap, and even shoes are difficult, if not impossible to come by, except for the privileged few.<br /><br />Late one night, Bernie is called to the scene when someone finds the mangled remains of a man who had been hit by a train.  The victim is identified as a thirty-nine year old railway worker from the Netherlands.  This incident is just one piece of a larger puzzle involving espionage, murder, and treason. In addition, Heydrich invites Bernie and a large contingent of friends to his palatial country home outside Prague.  There, the guests enjoy delicious food and drink and relax in their comfortable living quarters.  Unfortunately, this idyll is marred when one of the visitors is mysteriously slain in a room that was locked from the inside.  Heydrich orders Bernie, who is renowned for his ability to solve difficult cases, to investigate the crime and bring the perpetrator to justice.<br /><br />All of this occurs while the noose is relentlessly tightening around the necks of Jews both in and out of Germany.  Bernie, who candidly expresses his outrage even to Heydrich hiimself, claims not to care whether he lives or dies.  He detests hypocritical, corrupt, and depraved bullies who live luxuriously while ordinary Germans go hungry and enemies of the state are rounded up, tortured, and executed.  The author skillfully incorporates historical events and individuals into this well-constructed and absorbing work of fiction that has elements of humor, romance, and tragedy.  Kerr is an outstanding descriptive writer (\\"the red Nazi flags that were everywhere looked ... like blood dripping down the buildings\\") whose imaginative use of language enhances the novel immeasurably.  \\"Prague Fatale\\" has more than its share of profanity, slang (vitamin B = important connections), and scenes of violence that reflect the harshness and brutality of the times.  As the book draws to a close, Bernie hears the word Auschwitz (\\"a new kind of concentration camp\\") for the first time; much later, he will find out the nature of the atrocities that were committed there.ies.

B003F1WM2K|5.0|Many other reviewers have laid out the landscape of this book: when and where it took place and key people woven through it.  I thought it was an exciting view from a viewpoint of Patti who started out without a name in the entertainment/art world, looking at those who were making names for themselves....and the transition to Patti \\"making it\\" in the arts and entertainment world.<br /><br />But I think the most powerful theme of this book is a love story: a love story between two people that bridged time, sexual orientation, careers, and relationships with other lovers/partners.  The ending of the book is tender yet strong, and the losses described brought tears to my eyes. Rarely is a relationship so pure that either partner would make almost any sacrifice for the other, or let anything stand in the way of their friendship and love.<br /><br />Read it for the story of the true starving artists, the poetic writing, the descriptions of NYC and its icons, and two people who stand by each other no matter what.

B0036EH3WU|1.0|My wife and I loved this series and watched all six seasons over the 6 years it aired.  I decided to purchase this box set as a Christmas gift for her.  BIG MISTAKE, and here is why.  We started watching season 1 beginning in February, 2012.  In season 1 there is 7 discs, with disc 7 being a special feature disc.  We got to the season 1, two-part season finale and bam, right in the middle of the two-part finale, (Exodus, part 1 of 2), the disc would not play.  We have 5 dvd players throughout our home.  It didn't work on any of them.  So, no question that this is a defective disc.  I contact Amazon, and of course I get someone in the Philippines who I can hardly understand.  I'm trying to explain to her that this set has 39 discs, and that you wouldn't know if there was a problem until you actually had one.  A defective disc could occur in season 1 up to season 6, and anything in between as well.  In this case, the first defect for us was in the first season, disc # 6, (photo of the character \\"Sun\\" on the disc).  Who knows how many of the other 33 discs remaining are defective as well?  The Amazon rep tells me that we are past the window of returning the set, and I could only return the set up to January 31, 2012.  I asked her how the in the world were we supposed to watch all 39 discs in a month?!  After arguing with her for an hour and half on the phone until 1:30 am in the morning, she agreed to make an \\"exception\\".  How nice... you're so kind!  I was informed that if we had another problem with any of the discs after receiving the replacement set, we were stuck with it.  Yeah, right, NOT happening!  This is a really nice box set with all sorts of extras included.  The problem is, if you have an issue down the line, as you could because you're going to watch them in order, and won't know if you have a defective disc until it happens, then you're stuck with a defective set.  The replacement set is arriving tomorrow, 2/29/12, and I'm going to call Amazon as soon asit gets here and send it and the defective set back. NO WAY we're getting stuck down the line with possibly more defective discs.  The only alternative is to buy each season separately and watch them within 30 days.  Then if you have a problem you're in the window for a return/exchange or refund.  It stinks because the purpose of a collector's set is to have all of the seasons together in a set.  Hence the title, \\"Lost: The Complete Collection\\".  Amazon should review their policy regarding sets of this size.  How can you possibly check 39 discs from beginnig to end within 30 days unless you have no life and no job, and sit in front of the television 7 days a week!  Hello, it has 39 discs, wake up Amzon and be realistic!!!  Thumbs down on this purchase!  If you purchase this set, you can easily fall into the same return trap that we did!  Do yourselve's a favor, as much as you might want this set, buy the series one set at a time or you could very well regret it!!!
0201633612|4.0|This book came out after I had graduated college, and was recommended to me by past professors.  That was the level of quality of the book in the late 90's.<br /><br />This book was the inspiration for much of the permanent development to come after it, especially in forward-looking companies such as Microsoft.  This is why the book now has an old, dated feel.  Many current code practitioners are already versed in the birds-eye view of DP, and do not appreciate the fact that this book was a seminal beginning of the movement.<br /><br />Any developer that wishes to relive the birth of pattern development should buy the book, and read it not with an eye to modernity, but instead with an aire of historical relevance.

Why is she always in the hospitle?<br /> And this 'love triangle' had absolutly no fizzle to it.<br />overal, it's not a classic masterpeice material. But the books are a good read.

The product looks sharp and is high quality. The soft lining that closes on to the screen itself is soft and protects the screen well. Very happy with the product.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|In my opinion this should surely go down as one of the great classic period pieces.  I loved this mini series.  It is well rounded with true to life conflicts.  It deals with relationships between parents & children, siblings, friendships, trust, strengths, weekness and of course love.  It does not contain a lot of mushie gushie romance, so I can't classify it as only a chick flick, I believe men will enjoy it too.  The only thing I would have different is the last look on the leading lady's face.  I'm not giving anything away, it is a must see if you like period piece films...

I was hoping it would be solid with some really good songs, but I had no idea it would be so amazing and so powerful.  Definitely one of the best albums of the past few years (since Kasey Chamber's last album).  Only wish a few of the songs were longer and went on for another 3-4 minutes - especially \\"Back Where You Belong.\\"  It is that good!!  Highly recommended!!

B004A8ZWWO|1.0|I'm just not getting everyone fawning over this awful pic.  There was not one really funny scene or even one really funny line in the movie.  The plot was clunky at best, and Tia Leoni is just kinda thrown in there for window dressing I guess.  Eddie Murphy wasn't even trying, and Ben Stiller seemed to be trying too hard.  Alan Alda was the only redemptive role in the entire film, as he plays an \\"I-really-don't-care-about-you\\" investor with great smugness.<br /><br />Don't buy this.  Don't even rent it.  If you've got two hours to kill, take a nap.  It's cheaper and more satisfying.

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|This is a good top-scrolling shooter with plenty of weapon variety and a passable story that for me was worth a chuckle.<br /><br />I liken gameplay to a cross between Space Invaders and Galaxian, with upgradeable weapons thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Level variety consists of shooting waves of aliens, dodging/shooting asteroids, and periodic boss fights, and this is where the game can get old really quickly. I've played through the entire game twice since getting it as the FAOTD, and have enjoyed it, but by the end the levels were definitely getting boring.<br /><br />I'm a cheapskate, so don't know if I would pony up the asking price, but the game definitely is worth a download if you like mindless blasting forward. :-)
B006470HZ6|3.0|I have to reluctantly rate this season at three stars, even though overall the series rates four. I'd go 3 1/2 if I could. The first season successfully captured the feel of a global apocalypse. The first half of the second season had a reasonable number of roller-coaster peaks and valleys, capped off by the Barnyard Massacre. The second half, sorry to say, is falling a little short for me. There's a little too much storytelling through dialog, the interior sequences are for the most part kinda boring, and zombies seem more like a nuisance than a global threat.<br /><br />There is clearly a cut in the production budget. It shows. AMC used to be the go-to network for quality original series. They're on the verge of losing that, and it's the fault of the network bean counters who think viewers are too stupid to notice the corner-cutting.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|Original Review:<br /><br />\\"I've been using avast! free antivirus on my home computer for about six years now.  Over that time, I've had no issue with protecting my computer from bad guys.  So, when I got a new Fire (which I love) I wanted to protect it at the same level that I have been protecting my home computer with.  This antivirus wasn't immediately available, but when I saw it I snapped it up.<br /><br />The problem is that it does not seem to be optimized for the Fire, or if it is the settings are above my level of expertise.  The virus database doesn't refresh, so every time I scan, all of my other Apps show up as malware.  I know this not to be true, so I am weary about leaving this as my only protection.  I like avast!, so I'm willing to wait, but this seems more like it was built for the phones and not really fixed to work with the fire.  I'd advise you to wait until they have optimized this program.\\"<br /><br />But...they put out a release that fixed the problems, not the program works well, gathering my recommendation at this point.
0756951410|4.0|From a place in between heaven and earth fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon casually describes her December 6, 1973 rape and murder by a neighbor. Over the course of several years, she dispassionately, yet meticulously, observes her family and friends attempting to cope with their grief and loss. She even observes her murderer-rapist with an understandable desire for him to be caught and brought to justice, but also a deft fascination with the history of this classic sociopath borne from an emotionality deformed by a mother reminiscent of Ma Barker.<br /><br />For the next 328 pages Susie, more or less resigned to her life, or should I say afterlife, chronicles for us the journey her family and friends on earth must take to ultimately find some kind of healing.<br /><br />Susie tour-guides us through the ramifications of her death with a strange but effective detachment, although at times her voice seems a tad mature for a fourteen-year-old whose personal heaven stays truer to her age than do her words.<br /><br />Still, what we have here is a first-person observation of intimate feelings and actions of others easily achievable in a third-person narrative, but more difficult to pull off in this format.<br /><br />Novelist Alice Sebold, however, pulls it off admirably, made easier because her narrator is a spirit, able to observe unnoticed a grieving father's solitary anguish over the fact that his daughter's brutal murder is exacerbated by the discovery of a piece of the girl's elbow, her only recovered remains; the intimacy of a grieving mother's escape into the pitying arms of another man who, himself, has lost a family member (his wife) tragically.<br /><br />Young dead Susie is also able to watch Ray, the first and last boy she ever kissed, suffer through veiled accusations of culpability in the murder while still trying to deal with the strong feelings he felt, continues to feel, for his lost love. Susie observes him with initial detachment, but ultimately succumbs to her own deep feelings, resulting in a surrogate consummation that is at once spiritually uplifting and profoundly sad.<br /><br />But what is most startling is Susie's monitoring of her murderer-rapist, the neighbor Mr. Harvey. Eccentric but seemingly inconsequential, Harvey is a parent's worse nightmare who leaves nary a clue to his nefarious ways. And so it takes Susie on high to examine every detail and thought of this quiet monster, a serial killer whose past and future victims Susie commiserates with in the spiritual realm. With the calm of a PGA commentator she chronicles his every move, even as he attempts to lure Susie's still alive sister toward a similar fate.<br /><br />Although \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is not your garden-variety blood-gushing slasher tome, its horror oozes from raw emotions put to the test by a tragic event no one should but someone will always have to endure.<br /><br />I don't know at what age young people should read this strange but cautionary tale, but it contains lessons in great need of heading by youth and parents alike.to her own deep feelings, resulting in a surrogate consummation that is at once spiritually uplifting and profoundly sad.<br /><br />But what is most startling is Susie's monitoring of her murderer-rapist, the neighbor Mr. Harvey.

B0009A40ES|5.0|I love this movie, and it is impossible to be objective about it. There are only two things I can say bad about it. First, that one scene with the homeless guy and his dog? Yeah, that's a little too much.<br /><br />Secondly, even after watching the movie dozens or scores of times, and reading the book, I still have no idea what's going on at the end. That's crucial, because answering what &#34;Really&#34; happened is crucial to the ultimate take away. Are Herron and Ellis (by proxy) glorifying misogynist violence, or is there a morality tale at play. This ambiguity is to me both a strength and a weakness.
B006UG909U|1.0|This album is not from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band that i remember. Last time i checked Wolfgang has not earned the right to be a hall of famer. Sure he can play but man i feel sorry for him. I mean my God man these guys are old and according to what i hear these guys are bringing  you down.  I am so angry that i paid for this cd. It sounds like a very good drummer rocking with a great guitarist playing with an awesome frontman. However they are all going in different directions. The music does not gel with the lyrics. Who wrote this crap? Its 2012 so i waited this long for this thrash. Sure i am a fan of Van Halen both Roth and Sammy era. Its sure gonna take a lot more than Kool and the Gang to get me to pay for a ticket. People i work hard for my money just like you do so don't waste it on this. I recommend this album for my enemies only.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This has been a great app and I have had no problems with it. It is just what I needed to organize appointments and when my kids are home from college. I even started using it to keep track of when my wife has an overtime shift, she is thrilled because I never remembered anything.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|POINT BLANK PERIOD<br />THIS IS A GREAT CD, THE REMASTERING IS GREAT<br />ALSO THE 'LAST FILLMORE EAST CONCERT' CD IS TOTALLY WORTH IT<br />CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS
B005ONTD42|1.0|Looks great on the videos, so I bought one. (actually I bought 2, the other one for a present).<br />Anyway takes a bit of getting used to but you can get the hang of controlling it.<br />Yes the pets were interested in it.... for a while.<br /><br />Same as me. It was fun for about half an hour and then seriously its just a ball. On top of that its $129 !<br /><br />Way over priced if you ask me.<br /><br />I ended up returning the 2nd one I bought and gave the original one away as a present. They only used it once or twice and havent used it since.<br /><br />Nice \\"toy\\" but a but not worth the high price tag.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I won't lie... it's SO difficult for me to find books that I love.  And by love, I mean REALLY get into and can't put down.  Very few books have captivated me in this way, but the WOOL series was one of them.  I read the first one after downloading a sample of the omnibus for my Kindle.  What can I say?  I was hooked.  I read the remaining 4 books within a week, relishing every moment, but dreading the progress bar moving closer and closer to the finish line.  I didn't expect to be so captivated by these characters.  Most science fiction is so focused on the story that character development goes out the window.  Not so with this series, and I am so thankful for that.  This will definitely be a series to re-read.  I have already started 3 friends on it, and I know that they will enjoy it as much as I have.
B0059XTUMC|3.0|Basically, it's a retelling of A Star is Born with some plot changes. This movie started well, ended well, and had a long stretch in the middle that was repetitive, one after another episode of drinking and self-destruction, basically a long narrative of the main character's depression. I felt like yelling \\"do an intervention with this guy, will you?\\" That being said, there are some very clever bits of storytelling and acting. The dog was amazing but I was more worried for him than the human characters, especially with all that secondhand smoke he was inhaling.<br />There are a lot of films that play on human frailty as art but after a lifetime of watching what actually happens to people who live like this, I have no patience with it in fiction. There were no insights or revelations about it, no play on the metaphor of sound vs silent, just one downhill slide scene after another. At the end there was a deus ex machina twist that set it all aright, reminding me of Judy and Mickey resolving a plot with a musical number.<br />If you can keep your aesthetic distance from this film you may like it and enjoy the filmmaker's craft. Otherwise, you may not be entertained at all.
B000FC0OOU|4.0|Can I add anything to what has already been said? Well, I find this to be Hemingway's best piece of literature. The story is interesting (though sometimes the dialogue can come across as odd to me, it's from a different time, so some difference is to be expected). Especially interesting was the protagonist's work (a perfect example of UW, in my opinion), and what he did. Read it, enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice to kill time. plenty games to play and the games are no super easy so you don't get bored.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i really love this app, I've tried several weather apps and this one is my favorite by far. very stable never needs resetting
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I got my Kindle fire for Christmas and bought the Marware cover in graphite color for it a few days later.  I really like it.  I feel like it protects the screen well so I feel safer carrying my Fire around or stuffing it in my purse.  It was a snap (literally) to install and doesn't seem to add any weight. (The Fire is really kinda heavy for such a small thing)  The elastic band holds it closed tightly and also holds it in the open position so it doesn't flop around.  I am so glad that I invested the $30.  The only change I would like is if you could also stand it up vertically. (Don't know how they could do that though) It works pretty well to stand horizontally and is pretty stable but I play Scrabble and it will only display vertically so I can not use the stand for that game.  I am still very happy with it and am glad that I bought it. It seems well made. Definitely recommend.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This is a great movie, saw it in the theatre, acting was magnificent. Enjoyed it from beginning to end. Can definitely recommend it.
0345423496|4.0|Came with fast prompt delivery, after only a few days. A lot of people said it wasn't that good, but I found it to still be another Clarke great. Helped to really close out the series for me, and I enjoyed the pace it moved at.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is pure joy. It's pretty, it's engaging, it's challenging, and it even has a plot! If you remember 8 bit games, you will love it. Worth every penny.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a fun game, hate that u have to use game to get other games. the games that I have current are fun, some are hard
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It's much better than some of the free mahjong games which take a long time for matched tiles to clear off the board. It's fun to be able to win artifacts for completing a game. It gives you more of a goal. I also like that you can choose different styles of tiles and backgrounds.
B004RE29PO|5.0|This is a brilliant release of Aliens supervised by James Cameron, and includes the original theatrical release and the 1991 special edition release.<br /><br />The transfer to bluray has been very well done, and has been done without blending out the film grain of that era. If like me you missed the original cinematic release, this will be an orgy of detail that is sure to delight!<br /><br />The soundtrack has been beautifully mastered for this release and really is excellent.<br /><br />All in all, a concise release with all the useful extras, presented very well.
0792156684|5.0|Price, shipping time were good. And of the course, the movie in excellent shape. Can't wait till it comes back to the big screen in 3D on THEIR 100ST ANNIVERSARY..
B0058VW36U|5.0|its so awesome I play it every day. its awesome awesome awesome awsome awsome awesome  awesome awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! u must have this app XD:)  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ I LOVE MONEY
B005HV6Y5W|3.0|Kudos for not churning out the usual Hollywood garbage. In addition the visuals are beautiful. HOWEVER, the film is way too long and repetitive. How many shots do we need of the kid walking around looking frustrated and unhappy and of Brad Pitt being alternately loving and violent? We got the message the first time.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I didn't expect it to be a very fun app but it surprised me at being fairly fun even my cat tried to play it!!! though I do wish it had more something like levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|lots of fun great time consumer love the custom backgrounds have played double deck Klondike but takes too long and there isn't always a solution.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game. I love it so muth. I Wich there was more. It is the best game. You haft to get it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Nice secure cover.  Kindle Fire snaps in easily. Fire easy to handle as the cover fits so securely that it feels like part of the Kindle.  Would definitely recommend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun and entertaining!!<br />it is something that my entire family can enjoy not just one of us!!
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|Since I started reviewing a year ago, I have made it my mission to only review slasher films. I mean my name is Slasher Studios after all and if I started to review other horror films, I might lose my focus. Well, today I am about to break that rule. Today I am reviewing what I believe to be the best film of 2011. It is neither a slasher film nor is it a traditional horror film but it is a film that will stay with you long after many films have come and gone. The movie in question? The beautifully hypnotic \\"Martha Mercy May Marlene.\\"<br /><br />The film begins with the self destructive Martha (in a brilliant, one-of-a-kind performance by the beautiful Elisabeth Olsen) has run away from an abusive hippie-like cult where she was living as Marcy May for two years. She turns to her sister (nicely played in an understated performance by the always great Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law who take her in and want to help her. The problem is Martha is having a hard time separating dreams from reality and when haunting memories of her past keep resurfacing, she may need more help than anyone is able to give her.<br /><br />I try to go into as much detail as possible when I am doing my plot summaries but this is the rare case when I honestly believe that less is indeed more. This is exactly the type of movie where you will get everything that you put into it. Want a Hollywood type thriller in which all the plot threads are nicely tied up at the end? This is not the movie for you. All I can say is that the harsh realities of this film combined with some of the most lush and lurid cinematography add up to a film that I won't soon forget. The fact that Elisabeth Olsen wasn't nominated by the Academy this year is one of the grossest oversights in modern day cinema. There is power here. Let it take you and you may be surprised by just how much this film truly moves you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to play. my kids  would play this game all day long if I would let them. fun for all ages
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game<br />love any thing like this.  good for eye hand coordination ....good job.  look forward to seeing any new games that come out
B0009UC810|5.0|classic movie.  dvd in perfect condition, which should be a given...but i just had to return a brand new dvd with a defect, so go figure.
1612130283|4.0|I enjoyed all 3 books.  Was glad to see a conclusion to Christian and Anna's story.  While these books are not for everyone, I was disheartened to see so many negative reviews.  This book series has been a hot topic in various social settings over the last couple of weeks.  Word of mouth is spreading that \\"50\\" shouldn't be missed.  To each his own (eye roll)!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the setup of the board. I would like to have more background options and deck options as well.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|The title pretty much says it. There are a few issues with it crashing on my kindle fire, but other then that it is great.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is pretty cool but some of the games are like impossible to beat. some of the games are really fun and challenging
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Cool and very addictive. The different levels get harder and harder. The app is good and in my opinion. You'll love it.
B00005MCX2|5.0|Front to back it is just a Prog/Space rush,a masterpiece that puts you back in time(70's)when bands could do anything! The dream world they made on this tour would never be matched agian.So sit back and find those Lava lamps and Black lights and enjoy the ride! Also try [[ASIN:B00362DRNQ At the BBC 1972 - 2CD]]
B00003CX9E|5.0|My five favorite scenes from Citizen Kane:<br /><br />1) Kane is dying, holding a winters scene glass ball in his hand. He dies and drops the ball, it shatters. A nurse enters the room and is viewed through the leftover shards and contents of the glass ball on the floor. Nothing in any film up to that point had ever thought of such a cinematic touch. Genius.<br /><br />2) A woman is screaming at Kane as he desends a staircase, he opens the front door and a car horn sound mingles with and replaces the screaming. Blue my mind!<br /><br />3) Camera is placed underneath the floor, we look up at Kane, from shoes to head. Exciting extreme angle.<br /><br />4) In Kanes' pleasure dome, a new scene begins with a cockatoo screaching in close-up, flying away. The body of the bird did not seem solid, I thought I could see though it. Shocking sensation.<br /><br />5)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I wanted it for my kindle fire so i downloaded the kindle fire edition which didn't work, so i tried this one, which didn't work. Finally, I downloaded this exact same game in the android market, and it worked great on my kindle fire, AND my samsung galaxy S. Boo Amazon appstore! Yay Android Market!
0060873027|1.0|This is probably the worst sci-fi book I have read, and I have read volumes.  It's just plain silly but it's supposed to be serious.  I got within 30 pages of the end and just had to stop reading.  There are millions of good books so don't waste your time reading crap like this.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|By far the best headphones you can buy at the price point - these compete with headphones easily in the $200 range. The only small issue with these is that the highs can be a bit fatiguing, but if you have an eq, drop them 200 or so and it helps tremendously.
1401307450|5.0|I'm a fan of RHCP, though not a super fan. I don't know all their songs and up until this book didn't know a whole hell of a lot about the band. I knew that Anthony Kiedis had a sorted, vivid, and turbulent life and found him intriguing. So I bought the book. Normally I'm sort of skeptical about Biographies as some of them can be a particularly drab read. Not a single page of this was drab. His story was nothing short of captivating. I could not read this quick enough. Drugs, Women, Life, Injury, Recovery, Healing, and good old fashioned rock star adventure. You feel as though he really is letting you see his scars. His story is approachable and humble.A beautiful soul with a tragic story; up until now.
030788743X|5.0|If you were a kid in the 80s, and grew up on video games and television, you will probably end up saying the sentence I've heard from multiple other people...It's like this book was written just for me.
B006X96PF6|5.0|Well what can one say about the wonderful Loreena McKennit that hasn't already been said? She has a beautiful, ethereal voice that is made for celtic / worldly music. This live recording from a radio station studio consists of three musicians and the recordings are just wonderful. I bought the mp3's from another music store as amazon doesn't sell them for some reason (yet).<br /><br />The tracks on the album are of the \\"greatest hits\\" variety and you may already have them, but you don't have them like this. The difference with this recording is the sense of intimacy here. The other live records you can buy have different acoustics, those are mainly in large spacious halls where as these feel very \\"up close\\" and personal. I believe the instruments used here are cello, harp and guitar but I also hear some keyboards.<br /><br />Her voice is powerful, clear and an instrument all on its own. If you don't own any live recordings of Loreena's music, I highly recommend this one.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|Read Rothbard and Luwid Misses instead... (Man State and Economy, Human Action etc)<br />That's and only when you will realize that we are in a mess because of regulations and tariffs. The solution to all this is not more regulations but free markets.<br />Obviously this is a high budget movie to make innocent Americans believe this garbage.<br />Only corporations and governments benefit from regulations not the general public. In the 10,000 years of the history of mankind people haven't learned anything.<br />People are hopeless.<br />Read Read Read. Read about free market. Keynesian economics had failed one too many times.<br />Read free market capitalism, Islamic economics and a few others to understand the differences and claims. Do not buy what this film is selling. As an economics student of Ph.d i must warn you, the agenda pushed in this DVD is to place more and more regulations. The problems identified are correct, the cause due to which this is happening is incorrect and the suggested solutions are beyond hideous.<br />Thank you
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Overall, I thought it was amazing. The Australian director made many changes from the failed London show, and I hope to see this version on Broadway eventually. It has very beautiful music, the performers are amazing, and the sets are spectacular. There are a few minor things that irked me, but I think it definitely lived up to POTO as a companion piece.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love all :the games on this. my favorite is darts but its really hard. I think you should get this game.
0307959856|5.0|I loved it!!!!  I am a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice and especially the A&E production which I have watched many times.  However, after the final wedding scene I am left wishing for a sequel...and P.D. James has done it....I am satisfied now.  To anyone who has loved P&P and Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, you will enjoy this book AND Ms. James has even captured Jane Austen's prose.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's OK...prefer HP version on my desktop. Wish it would not add points to sort at top once you've won the game....inflates the score deceptively.
006197806X|4.0|WARNING: Spoilers for Delirium ahead.<br /><br />Pandemonium is the second book in Lauren Oliver's Delirium Trilogy. In the first book, Delirium, Lena lives in a future dystopian United States, where love has been designated a disease, and everyone is cured on their 18th birthday. Lena was eagerly anticipating her \\"cure\\" and her orderly, predictable life to follow, free from the \\"Deliria\\" that leads to mood swings, irrational behavior, violence, and death. That is, until she meets Alex, an \\"Invalid\\" from The Wilds - a boy who has never been cured and doesn't believe that love is something that needs a cure. Alex teaches Lena about love, and they plan to escape Portland to live in The Wilds together. But in the end, Alex sacrifices himself to allow Lena to escape.<br /><br />Pandemonium's narrative alternates between two separate time lines. The first picks up right where Delirium ends. It follows Lena in the days, weeks, and months after she has escaped Portland, losing Alex in the process. Predictably, she meets up with other Invalids living in The Wilds, and slowly assimilates to life with them. Away from the familiar comforts of the city. Away from fear of the Deliria. Away from Alex.<br /><br />The second takes place several months later. Lena is now an active part of the resistance, and is living undercover in New York City. Her cover is that she is part of a new political movement - the DFA or \\"Deliria-Free America.\\" The movement's mission is for the cure to be administered to everyone in America before their 18th birthday. Lena's mission is to keep an eye on the DFA, especially its leaders: Thomas Fineman and his son, Julian.<br /><br />[Spoilers Ahead]<br /><br />But everything turns to chaos when Scavengers - a violent extremist group of uncureds - attack a DFA rally, and Lena and Julian are kidnapped and held hostage together. Their captivity forces them to question their preconceived notions about each other and about who their enemies really are.<br /><br />Pandemonium was an enjoyable, exciting, fast-paced book. I did find it a bit predictable - I wasn't nearly as surprised as Lena at the twists and turns of the plot - but that didn't lessen my enjoyment of it at all. And as much as I loved Alex in Delirium and I wasn't sure initially if I would be able to accept if Lena moved on, I found that I loved Julian just as much as Alex. I appreciated how the evolution of Lena and Julian's relationship mirrored that of Lena and Alex - but with Lena's role reversed.<br /><br />Ultimately, I thought Pandemonium was a great set-up for the third book in the trilogy. I anticipate the conclusion to the Delirium Trilogy will contain lots of action, a likely love triangle (which is overdone in YA books, but in a world where the entire plot focuses around the benefits and drawbacks of falling in love, it probably can't be avoided), and Lena's deeper involvement with the resistance. It answered some questions set up in Delirium while asking several more. And it introduced us to some great new characters.<br /><br />My frustrations with the book were minor. I missed the characters from Delirium (but I suspect some of them will pop up in the 3rd book). I couldn't understand how just a couple days lost in the woods resulted in Lena needing weeks to recuperate, considering how physically fit she was at the end of Delirium. And several of Lena's great plans just seemed far too simple (especially in the couple parts where she has to deal with key codes).<br /><br />But overall, none of that was enough to take away from my enjoyment of the book. The storytelling was excellent, and I found myself completely immersed in the characters and world that Ms. Oliver created. I'm intrigued and excited to see how she wraps up Lena's story in book 3. Highly recommend!r />Pandemonium was an enjoyable, exciting, fast-paced book.

B0068MNO4S|3.0|As someone fascinated by the Authorship Question, I was really looking forward to this movie. And while it is well-done, it lacks the coherency and definitive persuasiveness one would hope such a film possessed.<br /><br />What this movie deserves praise for is its superb acting, especially by Joely Richardson and Vanessa Redgrave, expanse art direction, well-crafted script, fantastic sets that transform the audience into Elizabethan London, and plenty of action and intrigue.<br /><br />The film starts, surprisingly, in modern-day New York City, with a narrator leading us to question Who Was Really Shakespeare? It loses some of that tremendous creative goodwill, by tackling the Prince of Tudor subplot, which states that Shakespeare was Queen Elizabeth I's son (and, later, her lover, although she was unaware of the fact that their relationship was incestuous) -- the movie this loses credibility. It's almost as if Emmerich is too afraid to profess his belief that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford was Shakespeare, and must masquerade such belief behind an elaborate plot that will be liked by the Hollywood masses expecting a good, entertaining story and nothing more.

6304712936|5.0|I love my new movie! It plays perfectly with absolutely no problems! One thing that was a little weird was that half way through the movie the dvd had to be flipped. I'm guessing it's just because it's an old dvd, but I have no problem turning the disc over. I'm very satisfied!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great a lot of games and fun fun fun fun fun.  I would recommend it to a lot of people
B0052U59F4|3.0|As mentioned by a few other reviews, this book pretty much has all the same characters and same story as the Twilight series. The main character, Christian, even says things like \\"I'm no good for you Ana (Bella)\\" and \\"Welcome to my world\\". It's exactly the same. Even with her being the not-so-attractive brunette that gets the man instead of all the bombshell blondes, it's ridiculous.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a very addicting game.  good graphics, one of the best games to play on a tablet.  I could play this game all day.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I remember being a young pup right out of High School back in 1985, looking forward to this massive concert.  Here it is 27 years later, and it still rocks your socks off.  QUEEN and FREDDIE MERCURY stole the show with perhaps the best live perfomance of the decade.  The Finale with Paul McCartney playing the piano on LET IT BE is nothing short of breath-takingly haunting and beautiful.  Well worth adding to your classic rock collection just for that.  I remember trying to watch the finale live, with DICK CLARK interupting every five seconds to tell us that there was a technical problem with Paul's mike, and that every technician in the entire was working on it.  Dick, just shut up and let us enjoy the piano!!  Other than that, this DVD collection hits it right out of the ball park, and you can't go wrong with adding to your collection.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun game, lots of levels to progress thru. Kinda laggy at first. Runs smooth once loaded though, great toilet game.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|I have to admit that I'm not even sure just why I enjoyed this movie.  I generally despise anything that takes liberty with history and I personally believe this movie takes that liberty to the point of mockery.<br /><br />I do think that I mostly enjoyed DiCaprio playing a grown up role and stretching his acting muscle - if you can call playing the stoic, ill humored J. Edgar stretching.  Though I must admit to being a bit put off by his voice in the initial scenes, I realized that J. Edgar's voice also had that slight annoying quality - rhythmic, monotone.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy the movie if you will, but know that it primarily a work of fiction and a tad fawning to the legacy of a strange, narcissistic, jealous man who bartered despicable with despicable and whose paranoia matched Richard Nixon.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Being able to see the entire series at once was just great.  Not only is this series worth the watch, but the teens might develop some interest in history as well.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Bennett Miller's \\"Moneyball\\", starring Brad Pitt, was an enjoyable look at what goes on behind the scenes in the world of baseball.  I'm still not quite sure what was so radical about the \\"new way\\" Pitt's Billy Beane character selected players, as he just seemed to think outside the box a little more often than his scouts and advisors did, but then I'm not a huge baseball expert.  I did enjoy that it was a sports movie that was generous in its subtlety and light on simplistic moments of triumph.  The skillful, effective balance of heart and smarts helped, too.
0451208706|4.0|Follett certainly has a gift for capturing the essence of the times.  His depiction of both the surroundings and of the people is a delightful talent.<br /><br />The protagonist is given away by the title.  Although he is quite wicked, you find yourself feeling for him, even wanting to like him.  This hardened anarchist travels to England from Russia bent on killing a prince from his homeland.  While in England, the prince lodges with an aristocratic family where negotiations are held concerning terms of territory of an anticipation of the looming First World War.  Within this family there contains a twist, but you will need to read it.<br /><br />The characters are each with their own unique, debilitating faults.  They are all sadly, very flawed.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I have been using these models for many years now. There perhaps the most robust and solid headset I have ever used. The ruggedness of the cord is nice and the rubber stoppers around the volume pad and connection areas make sure the cords wont get ripped out, which has happened to other headsets I have owned. Plus I like how the mic can hide fully into the arch.<br /><br />Now I WILL say this. This is my 2nd pair due to a design flaw. Because the mic can hide into the main support arch on the left side, this makes the left arch weaker. I never dropped the headset, smashed it, pulled on it, nothing like that. But one day near the top where it connects to the adjusting slide it just snapped clean apart. The speakers and mic still worked, but I had to put electrical tape over it to keep wearing it. Even then, it just never felt the same and here you are embarrassed to show it to others.<br /><br />Now after you have read that you're probably thinking why did I buy another? And why do I still recommended you get this. As I said before the build quality, design, and thought of keeping the unit strong and durable is very present. Plantronics knew what they were doing and saw the sorry and weak state the current headset market was. And the unit that did break lasted almost 2 years. Thats a record for the headsets I have owned, many of which die/break after only a few months!<br /><br />On top of that these sound great! The last pair I had was the 377, the 'opened ear' version. There really isn't much of a difference between the two design wise. However I will say I did noticed a good bass and volume boost on this model. The 377 just was to quiet for some songs. The 367 is fine on its own, but I do plan on getting a amp for these sometime soon, as the other reviewers of these recommend.<br /><br />I HOPE these will not break like the last one did, but again these hold the record for longest lasting in my books. For the price and the features it offers there is no other comparison. If they break again a few years from now, I'll be back looking at Plantronics. Get these and have fun!

1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's book is very inspirational and written from a place of love and wisdom.  She talks about growing up in Hong Kong feeling insecure and inadequate as a child because she was unable to fit in with the kids at the catholic and British schools she went to,  She was raised in the Indian-Hindu culture, and she was often conflicted between wanting to please her parents who believed that women should be subservient to the men they marry in their arranged marriages. She also wanted to follow her own dreams and be more independent.  Two of her close friends were diagnosed with cancer; she then started to research the causes of cancer and she became very fearful of many things.  She writes she  developed an intense fear of living thinking that things all around her caused cancer like cell phones, genetically modified  foods, pesticides, and toxins in the air and water, etc.  Anita later recounts that  feelings of inadequacy and her self-judgement along with her intense fear were probably a main cause of her illness.<br /><br />When Anita was diagnosed with cancer she resorted to alternative treatments first because she understandably was afraid of chemotherapy after seeing how her friends had suffered.  After about four years of battling cancer she was taken to the hospital, her body was full of tumors, she went into a coma, and she was given 36 hours to live.  She writes an incredibly beautiful account of her experience on the 'other side'. She felt unconditional love that was indescribable with words.  She felt Oneness and interconnectedness with the whole universe and she details an incredible expansion of her awareness. She saw that cancer is not caused by bad karma from past lives.  She was was given the option to go back to her body and she knew that in her new higher state of being of unconditional love she would heal rapidly.  Many people live in fear of getting cancer thinking that it is randomly caused by our genes or by bad luck.<br /><br />The China Study by T.Colin Campbell shows that the western illnesses or chronic illnesses of cancer, heart disease and diabetes type 2, are completely preventable.  The China Study shows that when people in China live in big cities and eat a western or American diet of meat, dairy, sugar refined grains and processed  foods, they start to develop high rates of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  The people in the rural areas of China who eat a traditional plant-based diet like their ancestors. have very low rates of cancer and diabetes, and heart disease was nonexistent,  The China Study also mentions that 50% of women who have the breast cancer gene never get breast cancer.  The book is full of examples of how diet affects our genes.<br /><br />Chronic illness is caused by our lifestyle; we are not victims of our genes.  Unhealthy diet and stress negatively affect how our genes are expressed. Wheat, meat, dairy, sugar and processed foods acidify our body and are full of empty calories.  Bacteria, viruses and cancer thrive in acidic environments.<br /><br />Fruits and vegetables each have hundreds of phytochemicals and phytonutrients, these chemicals give each fruit and vegetables their color and flavor.  phytochemicals and phytonutrients are important in preventing and reversing chronic illnesses.  The phytonutrients and chlorophyll in green vegetables alkalize and detoxify the body.  The phytonutrients in fruits specially the berries and red fruits like pomegranate and cherries etc. can help repair DNA and rejuvenate the cells.  Books like Super Immunity by Joel Fuhrman, and others, show how phytonutrients can prevent and reverse illnesses, Super Immunity contains the latest scientific studies showing how phytonutrients can repair and rejuvenate our DNA.  When your body is alkaline you greatly reduce the probability of getting cancer or infectious illnesses.<br /><br />The cancer establishment keeps using chemotherapy and radiation as their main treatment options,yet they still have not found a cure, and yet they continue searching for a cure using chemotherapy. How long will they continue this game?  Was it not Albert Einstein who said stupidity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results?  Isn't it obvious at this point that chemotherapy is not the answer.<br /><br />I have been listening to Gary Null radio show for several years.  He is a nutritionist, a best selling author and award-winning documentary film producer [[ASIN:1607660067 Death by Medicine]] Through the years I have heard him interview several people who he has helped to reverse cancer and other illnesses, using natural nutritional therapies. Gary Null speaks of the \\"law of compensation\\", you have to compensate for the limitation to the cells caused by unhealthy lifestyle habits or the genetic limitation which predisposes us to certain illnesses.  The main way to compensate our cells is through high amount of green vegetable juice to flood the cells with  phytochemicals and phytonutrients from various sources.  Also powders and concentrates made from freeze-dried vegetables and green juices like wheat grass, broccoli, spirulina, etc.  Fresh juice combined with green powders are specially powerful, though fresh juice from broccoli and kale would have to be diluted with 80% cucumber juice or celery juice or water.  Also powders and concentrates from red fruits and berries are important.  There are also many \\"super-foods\\" on the market.  Freeze-dried berry powders and green powders are an economical way of getting additional fruits for our health drinks.<br /><br />There is no money to be made on green juice or nutritional supplements because they cannot be patented.  It is unthinkable that the medical establishment and the FDA play politics with people's health. Chemotherapy treatment can cost a couple hundred thousand dollars.  The FDA does not approve treatments that do not funnel billions of dollars to their friends in the pharmaceutical industry, which also controls  the curriculum in the medical schools.  There are many thousands of scientific studies published in scientific journals showing the safety and effectiveness of fruits, vegetables, herbs and nutritional supplements for preventing and reversing illnesses but mainstream medicine does not use natural therapies because it has been corrupted by the special interests of the pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />The current medical and pharmaceutical establishment would collapse if people adopt a healthy plant based diet.  There is nothing in natural plant foods that could clog your arteries.  The saturated fat in coconuts is healthy,  Meat, dairy and fish contain unhealthy saturated animal fat and cholesterol that can clog your arteries.  Plant foods contain no cholesterol. The Omega-3 in fish comes from algae at the bottom of the food chain.  Walnuts are very high in Omega-3 and most nuts and seeds also contain good amounts.  Lentils, beans, nuts and seeds and whole grains are all good sources of protein, and also contain antioxidants.  The China Study and other books show that we do not have to fear cancer.  It is not a mystery what causes and prevents cancer, the only thing we have to fear is \\"blissful ignorance\\".<br /><br />Thank you Dr. Wayne Dyer, for helping bring this book to the world, and for all your work, and thank you Anita Moorjani for being an inspiration and for your beautiful book.yet they still have not found a cure, and yet they continue searching for a cure using chemotherapy.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the game its just that sometimes it can get a little frustrating when your that close and you run out of time. I cant stand the airplane game at the beginning. its hard. it seems impossible.
B005SNP6FS|1.0|Ok......this movie was a complete waste of time. Don't watch it, you will be sorry. Colin Farrell was sexy and I loved to watch him walk.....haha.....that was about all the enjoyment I got out of this horrible movie. Not only was it a \\"what?\\" storyline, I couldn't understand a bloody word they said half the time. I understand this was a gangster movie but, f--- this and f--- that everyother word???---not so much. Horribly done.....and I am with the other review that was just glad it was over, even though he dies in the end.
0307887960|5.0|My sister came to visit last October 2011 and she looked great!  Lost around 30 pounds and was wearing a size 8 from a 14.  Asked her what she was doing and she pulls the Dukan Diet book out of her suitcase.<br /><br />Having tried every diet out there and a few I made up, I decided to open my mind and allow myself to follow this plan without prejudice.<br />I was extremely fit, active and a size 7 prior to children.  Taught aerobics and was a personal trainer, so I know how to eat and exercise but this life does not allow me to live like I did 15 years ago.<br /><br />The genius of the Dukan Diet, is it is nothing new, but he has stripped away all the fluff and circumstance of other plans and gotten down to what works and why it works.  It did sound familiar, but with a fresh honest take that did not push any food agenda, just eat and lose.  I've been on diets where I could not have caffeine, no diet sodas, no pepper, etc. and each time I could not avoid having pepper, or caffeine or other restriction, I felt like I failed and went off the diet.  Fell back into old habits and regained the weight.  This is not Atkins.  This is not South Beach. This is not Fat Flush. This is not Weight Watchers.  No counting or logging anything.  No weighing. No pills, no shakes, no powders, just whole foods which for me has been a budget saver over frozen meals and meal replacements and fat burners.<br /><br />The book is a easy read, but do not skim over it, read it!  Understand his principles and they will guide you throughout the plan.<br /><br />I started Oct 2011 along with another female family member and we have both lost close to 40 pounds to date. I am losing inches and my hair, skin and nails are glowing and growing.  It is the easiest plan I have ever followed.  Those that have difficulty are the ones that resist the food list and want to incorporate processed foods and powders.  My first phase was 5 days and I lost 6 pounds.  The shortest first phase of all the diets listed above, remember Atkins first phase and SB and FF are all closer to 14 days.<br /><br />I am now on the 2nd phase and feel great and fitting into much smaller sizes.<br /><br />For those that want to avoid Soy, artificial sweeteners, etc. they are allowed, not required.  I use Stevia, and dont use any soy products, tofu, or anything else I feel strongly against eating. There are over 100 foods listed that you can eat in unlimited quantity.<br /><br />Like I tell anyone that asks me what I am doing to lose weight, first I tell them they have to be ready, but when they are, DD is an easy plan to follow with the least amount of rules and restrictions.  If you look for excuses, you will always find them, but this diet is not unhealthy, nor does it promote an unsustainable lifestyle.  Eating processed junk is unsustainable and unhealthy.  Thanks to my big sis for recommending!!<br /><br />PS. I buy my oat bran right here on Amazon[[ASIN:B004VLVASA Bob's Red Mill Oat Bran Cereal, 18-Ounce (Pack of 4)]] and a milk frother for my Skinny morning latte [[ASIN:B005R2L2EO Froth Au Lait MINI STAINLESS Hot and Cold Milk Frother]]
0140432051|5.0|Enthusiastic readers approaching Darwin's revolutionary book often find themselves sorely disappointed. They expect a great existential debate on the origin of Man and instead they get arguments on why this or that tree produces fruit with a fuzzy skin.<br /><br />The reader who perseveres however will find a beautifully argued hypothesis explaining why the living things we find now in nature are both so similar to one another and so different from one another. Darwin explains why there are species of plants, trees, flowers, and ferns; why there are species of animals, insects, and pigeons; and why species can be classified into groups of similar but distinct species of cabbages or ants or primates.<br /><br />The book is superbly organized as \\"one long argument\\", to quote Darwin's own description of his work, and the first four chapters deserve to be singled out.<br /><br />It opens by examining variations under domestication. Darwin presents species we know very well have been modified consciously over time. Pigeon breeding had been a rich man's hobby for centuries and Darwin had copious data to cull. And while Darwin certainly was a rich gentleman, he was no snob when it came to appreciating expertise: he enthusiastically corresponded, discussed, and chatted with horse trainers, cattle breeders, and fruit farmers.<br /><br />The second chapter presents examples of variation in nature. Important ideas Darwin describes include a) that while human breeders act on this or that feature of an organism, nature always acts on the entire organism all at once and b) while man works a breed for a few decades or centuries, nature works on all species for millions of years.<br /><br />The third chapter explains that the natural environment is not a paradise or an Eden, but rather that it is a harsh competitive place where every organism must struggle to survive.<br /><br />The fourth chapter finally describes Darwin's theory of natural selection contrasted to Man's artificial selection. The theory of course is absurdly simple. Children (plants or animals) are very slightly different from their parents. Parents have more children than can possibly survive. Children who are slightly stronger and faster will have a slightly better chance of surviving and having their own children. As this process happens over millions of years and with billions of individuals, the differences accumulate into the diveristy of species we have today.<br /><br />This simple theory has far reaching consequences. Darwin devotes a whole chapter to these Laws of Variation and then several chapters to anticipate objections to his theory. It is in the first of these chapters, brilliantly but humbly titled \\"Difficulties On Theory\\" that Darwin shines brightest.<br /><br />For instance he freely admits that it seems absurd that an organ as perfect as the eye can have developed without an agent to design it. But Darwin points out that we have species where the eye is a single nerve cell that detects the presence or absence of light and nothing more. We have species that have bundles of nerve cells coated with pigments that detect different colors and amounts of light. We have insects with faceted eyes that also begin to discern shape.<br /><br />In short in nature today, we can find a series of species all possessing the same organ but each possessing a different grade of that organ ranging from rudimentary to extreme perfection. If these insensible gradations all are found today, it requires no great leap of the imagination to see they could have accumulated over time as well.<br /><br />Finally Darwin is a humble man but without false modesty. He is justifiably proud of his insights and the care with which he has researched his evidence. He is also conscious of his ignorance. He doesn't presume to discuss the origin of life and he says so explicitly. (Though we've found out quite a bit more about that since his day!) His book is filled with statements that if true would ruin his theory. He is a scientist who understands he must supply criteria against which his ideas are to be tested, and his theory on the origins of species by means of natural selection has passed these tests with flying colors.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyold ruin his theory. He is a scientist who understands he must supply criteria against which his ideas are to be tested, and his theory on the origins of species by means of natural selection has passed these tests with flying colors.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo

B000VLE3IS|1.0|The reports of idiotic packaging are true.  I bought this collection brand new, and the discs were already scuffed and scratched from being jammed tightly into the cardboard sleeves. As soon as the first disc started skipping, I took it back to the store and exchanged it for the non-DVD version. From what I've read, the DVD isn't that great anyway.

When i move them a little more, the character does a full 180 degree turn...and the input lag is terrible as well. It responds literally one second after you press the buttons or move the analog sticks. The vibration feedback isn't too great either. This MIGHT be good for RPG's and 3rd person shooters...

B005MMJ84K|4.0|DELIRIUM, Lauren Oliver's beautifully crafted dystopian novel set in a world where love had been declared a curable disease, was my most recommend book last year. Every book loving friend I knew got a copy shoved into their hands, and the ones who weren't big readers got a copy and a heartfelt plea to try it. Every single person I recommended it to loved it. That hasn't happened to me since THE HUNGER GAMES.<br /><br />The world in PANDEMONIUM is grander in scope than the one portrayed in DELIRIUM. The story isn't confined to Lena's sheltered world. She dredges through the Wilds, the Capital in New York and the hidden world beneath it. And it isn't just about the Cured and the Invalids either. There are Scavengers, Intruders, and the hardcore DFA members who are zealously fighting to force the cure on children. We find out that it's not just the invalids who are perceived as a threat, but anyone deemed weak or infirmed. It's an ugly, ugly reality and one that instantly unites the reader with the Resistance and the now fully aware Lena.<br /><br />PANDEMONIUM is told in alternated chronologies. One picks up in the Wilds just moments after the end of DELIRIUM, and the other several months in the future in the Capital where Lena is posing as a Cured to gain intel for the Resistance. The beginning is a tad on the slow side, and only one of the chronologies proved really interesting. I sort of grew impatient with the slow chapters in the Wilds, but the Capital chapters were gripping. Lena was under the constant threat of exposure as she had to fight to keep from reacting too passionately to the things going on around her. The stakes became even higher when her path crossed with the DFA President's son. By the time the two chronologies converged...I once again succumbed to the deliria of loving this series. And the ending, the very last page, was like a punch in the gut, leaving me reeling in the same way the ending of DELIRIUM did.<br /><br />Just like with DELIRIUM, PANDEMONIUM delivers the same beautifully expressive writing, the same frightening world, the same heartbreaking romance, and an ending that will leave you just as breathless for the next book. REQUIEM, the final book in the Delirium trilogy, will be published in February 2013<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />KissingDEMONIUM delivers the same beautifully expressive writing, the same frightening world, the same heartbreaking romance, and an ending that will leave you just as breathless for the next book.

B005HSL626|5.0|somepeople think that this game is stupid but its not ok it is awesome so people who think its lame or stupid your wrong
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was an amazing, insightful read.  Not only into the operations and life of a Navy SEAL, but into the mindset and character as well.  I'm humbled and grateful that America still produces men such as Chris Kyle.  His story is fascinating and completely engrossing.  I really enjoyed the added bits from his wife - it really shows what the families of these men go through in their sacrifice for our country and freedom.  This book should be required reading at every high school across America.  Thank you, Mr. Kyle, to you and your family for all you have done in service to America.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game. has lots different games. very stimulating and mind bending. game has many ways to be played and many of them are very popular.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A simple solitaire game that does what it is supposed to, and stays out of the way. The nagware every hand is a bit much, but not a dealbreaker.
B0002V7O3I|2.0|Featuring early performances by Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix, Explorers is a very basic kid's sci-fi film featuring three middle school boys who are able to build a spaceship out of junkyard parts and then use the one genius' technological \\"flying ball\\" wonder to cause the ship to be able to travel into outer space, eventually to an extra-terrestrial spaceship featuring 2 goofball green alien monster kids who just happen to have a huge love for American television. If this sounds completely far-fetched, that's because it is. But what you end up with is an overall just barely average film with very little real comedy and very little enticing action. I bought this movie as I am a big fan of 80's films and was looking forward to seeing 2 very classic Hollywood actors in early child roles. Yet what I ended up watching was really, a disappointment.<br /><br />Initially, the \\"space team\\" really only involves River Phoenix and his friend played by Ethan Hawke, River being the science wiz and Hawke being the more rambunctious lady's man. They eventually recruit the anti-bully anti-hero rough and tough kid (played by an actor I don't remember), and the three set out to build an elaborate flying machine. Unfortunately, what starts out in what could be a very interesting premise given these character's personalities is wasted on a plot that nobody really cares for. River invents some sort of hovering device which he can somehow create using his computer and control it as well. The effects for this pink ball thing are cheesy at best, but then again I'll forgive it as this is an 80's budget film. The three boys then go to a scrap yard and we get our obligatory montage scene of the them using all types of hardware to create a floating metal ball they can all three travel in. All this time you're wondering where the movie is actually going, or if there is any real conflict or antagonist these kids encounter. There isn't. Thus still, we're there watching these three kids we ACTUALLY LIKE going through the motions of a preset barely average plot.<br />The kids eventually get into outer space and land in some kind of ship where they meet up with a very child-friendly green googly-eyed alien who just happens to be just around the three boys' ages. They also meet his googly-eyed kid alien sister. What follows is the second half of this mostly yawn-inducing yarn where we just get to watch this dumb alien spout off pop culture tv references. The three boys are figuring out that these aliens are \\"just like them,\\" so as not to scare any little kids watching the movie. The alien kids eventually get in trouble with their alien dad and the three boys are back off to their own home planet.<br /><br />The biggest gripe I had with this movie is that it really does nothing, and goes nowhere. There is no real conflict between the boys and another antagonist, or even conflicts within the boys themselves. The film starts off showing these three boys in their middle school setting, which could very well have been used to introduce new characters that maybe the boys could have had some sort of dealings with in regards to their space project. One girl shows up who Ethan Hawke's character likes but nothing is ever made of it. The rebellious boy of the trio saves Hawke's character from getting beat up, but nothing is ever made of the conflict between them and the bullies. Not even any of their parents are ever showcased. In short, nothing is ever done. What is even more aggravating than this is that these boys really do put on great performances, and each of their own characters is highlighted well, thus we come to really like them, and maybe hope they can be used in some other ways. Perhaps Ethan could have \\"accidently\\" brought on board the girl he likes, or be forced to do so. Perhaps one of their parents could have come into conflict with them and their spaceship building project. Perhaps the bullies could have messed up the boys' plans somehow, or stolen the science nerd's idea about the flying orb, and used it in irresponsible ways, causing the boys to devise some kind of plan. I don't know, SOMETHING besides what we get here. Because anything else would have worked given the three very good and willing actors these filmmakers had to work with. Yet we get nothing, and I wish the entire portion of the scipt having the boys land on the alien spaceship had been scrapped, as that overly long, overly annoying and overly boring part of the film really ruins the entire thing completely.<br /><br />So if you want to put on something that'll entertain your 3 year old (as I don't really see this film entertaining anyone older than that), then buy this one and pop it in for an hour and a half. They'll forget it in 10 minutes, as will you.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Having fun with this game. Recommend for all ages. Some le else are challenging but it's the challenge that makes it fun.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I have been considering this game for a while. I took the plunge after mixed reviews.  once you purchase it does require you to download an extra 80 Meg. I think the software description does need to be changed.  I have a kindle fire and it errored out during the download but when I started it again it continued right where it left off.  played the game with no problems. can be addictive.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game its highly additive and a fun challenge I reccomend u get it the sound can be turned off as.in some other games u cant shut it off!
B006ON41FC|4.0|Game is fun and a good way to kill time. my only issue with it is a little glitchy, with the screen freezing.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|basically its just a bunch of dots you can move with you're finger its fun to chill to but makes you sleepy its ok
B006ON41FC|1.0|The app is yet another which implements the super annoying &quot;beg for a rating&quot; anti-pattern. The game play is acceptable, but the rating being has me going nuts.
B004FOA84A|4.0|it keeps you guessing about wat clues will come next. the. clues make you really think but are very easy to understand.
0061714372|5.0|The amount of hardcore drug and alcohol abuse this guy has done is amazing. And don't worry, he talks openly and frankly about it in length. to finally get the full story on his relationship with the Metallica guys is eye-opening as well. I didn't realize he was such close friends with Lars in the beginning. The only thing I was let down buy, is that he doesn't go into more detail about the album and track development on such Iconic pieces like Rust in peace and countdown. It's more like \\" I was really high, then we made rust in peace, then I went to rehab and then we made countdown...\\" however I suppose the book is quite large, so I suppose some stuff had to be skimmed over. Still, Definately a must read for any metal fan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I use it daily and couldn't be happier with it. it provides everything I need.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this app is great to kill time.  easy to use...can get addicting.  it does get a little repetitive though....maybe a different map would help
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Well developed program as far as functionality. Normally a is unnecessary but this one is actually pretty cool. Fun game, worth the download.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What can I say that other have not already said? The book is dark, brutal and full of action and intrigue. The characters are rich and alive, the setting is vividly depicted and the pacing is excellent. If you love dystopian settings, this book and series should be a perfect fit for you.<br /><br />Don't let the \\"teen\\" label scare adults away. While it may be easy reading, it isn't dumbed down to a point that you feel your more mature senses are offended. It is written in a simple style but it's also a great story-telling style as well. Adults may even love this one more than the kids and I think this book will go down as an all-time classic. It will be read in classes of ages to come as an example of a great book.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Personally, the clear sound and the wireless ease were unable to overcome the annoying harsh sounds often emitting from the headset. I prefer my wired turtle beaches (X11's I believe) If you can deal with it (most likely not) then I suggest you steer away from this product. If you connect via WiFi and attempt to do anything other than game (for example download an app) the headset will make the horrible noises. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. It's your decision, and your ears.
1849514003|5.0|If you've had some experience with development in Objective C on the iphone, and want to learn how to develop games, this is a great cookbook. The book starts with an introduction to graphics, animated sprites, and OpenGL, but delves quickly into more advanced topics, such as writing and reading using different file formats, creating an isometric game `engine', integrating box2d physics, and using the A* algorithm for pathfinding.<br />I've been creating games for a few years, and did learn some good tips and techniques in this book, but some of them I had already learned through trial and error on my own.<br /><br />So if you have programming experience, and have started game development in the past, or created a small game, this book could save you lots of time, learning tools needed to create full games, versus figuring it out on your own over a long period of time. If you're already an experienced game developer, and newer to using Objective C, this book might still be useful for seeing how to translate from development on other devices to on the iphone.
B007APGHLY|5.0|I didnt know what to expect when i bought this... i was afraid the songs would all be like rack city, and faded. I like them, but they aren't that great to me.. But I am VERY pleased with this album. I think all the features are great.. a few of my favorite tracks are, I'm gone, For the Fame, Black Crowns and Light Dreams. Those are just a few.. I would recommend this!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|brings me back to arcade days. These guys don't take themselves too seriously. Cute, self-referential humor. A fun gamethat pays homage to the really early space shooters

B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are challenging but great stress relievers. also they are really fun. finally they give you points for just trying the game. its awesome.
0439023491|3.0|OK, I've now read all three books. This one is the middle of the trilogy. So you're kinda stuck and have to read it as the third book is based on material in this one. The first book was so powerful and interesting that it dominates the other two. This second one is a weak sister of the first. Almost a replay with a significant twist, not to be revealed here.<br /><br />Character development, or lack thereof, is why I give book 2 only three stars. And I do not feel the love between Katniss and Peeta or Gale. It's like she is ambivalent, but is ambivalent about even that. I felt more relationship development between MockingJay and the other Victors than I did with her boyfriends.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;THIS IS THE LAST WINDOWS OS SYSTEM I EVER BUY. THE CURSOR JUMPING PROBLEM IN WINDOWS 7 IS HELLACIOUS!!<br /><br />Sorry for the outburst. But I have grown weary of tracking my cursor because of Microsoft's laziness at code writing. If you own a Windows 7 laptop, you know what I mean.>>>><br /><br />Anyway, the book is an easy, uncomplicated read. A tad too shallow for me. Good trilogies to me are: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and its two follow-ons and the Lord of the Rings. Another oldie but goodie are the three non-fiction books Robert Ardrey put out: The Social Contract, Territorial Imperative, and African Genesis.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have the ATT Samsung Note and it works great.  When you finish a wave just hit the menu button to go back to the main screen.  Leaves me where I left off.
B0000669JL|5.0|I received my purchase promptly, and in great condition. I was very pleased with it all around. It was even more than I expected as it turned out to be 2 discs and I was pleasantly surprised. CD's were in great condition - very happy
B00000099Y|5.0|This album may have some filler that isn't really music and oddball noise filler tracks, but it also has some of the most inventive and progressive rock songs ever on it. There's an atmosphere on this album and the songs on this album that just overpowers the listener. This was Tool's creative peak and Tool is an extraordinary band so that's saying something. For some people, they'll fall in love with this immediately and for others it may take a couple listens to absorb it all.<br />Some notable songs from it are:<br />Stinkfist, H, Forty Six-and Two, Third Eye, Aenema (in no particular order)<br />.<br />This is an album that I don't feel compelled to ramble about or list track ratings because I feel so strongly that this is a must-own album. The only way to describe this is pushing the boundaries in hard rock/metal music while still managing to maintain an accessibility that bridges gaps.<br /><br />If you buy this, you'll see what i mean. I implore you to get one of the best albums of the 90's
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I have been cutting wine bottles and beer bottles ... I have never cut glass before I bought this. This thing is just a rig to keep your glass cutter steady and consistent.  Its not a complex machine.  People who complain about the quality of the cuts are just making poor cuts.  There are some good videos on how to use this properly and how to cut bottles in general on youtube, do yourself a favor and watch them.  Finally, dont use the tapper if you want an even cut: use heat and cold.
B00005B36H|5.0|I'll admit that when I got this album in 2001, I felt a little underwhelmed the first time I listened to it. My introduction to Tool was \\"Aenima\\" and that was like a revolutionary charge of energy when I listened to that. \\"Lateralus\\" is one of those albums that gets better with every listen. After 3 more listens to this album straight through, I found that the songs were just as revolutionary as the ones on \\"Aenima\\" but in a different way. This is an extremely complex album by a very intelligent band. It's metal but on this album, Tool is the at the most experimental they've ever been in their career. Maynard's voice flows more melodically and gracefully than any other Tool album, the lyrics and concept of it all is extremely complicated, and the song structures are more thought-out and layered (dabbling in different cultural styles of music at times). You'll still hear what you love about the band and even a couple filler tracks that are similar to the ones on \\"Aenima\\".<br />Heres a brief rating of each song:<br /><br />1. The Grudge- 5/5<br />2. Eon Blue Apocalypse- 3/5<br />3. The Patient- 5/5<br />4. Mantra- 2/5<br />5. Schism- 5/5<br />6. Parabol- 5/5<br />7. Parabola- 5/5<br />8. Ticks and Leeches- 5/5<br />9. Lateralus- 5/5<br />10. Disposition- 4/5<br />11. Reflection- 5/5<br />12. Triad- 4/5<br />13. Faaip de Oiad- 3/5<br /><br />If you're a fan of Tool, it's a no brainer that you should buy this.<br /><br />If you need a starting point with Tool, \\"Aenima\\" is the perfect album to go with.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|The movie is for mature audiences and humorous, yet basically a remake of the original. I am not happy with the Ultraviolet, which i can't just download like a digital copy. I have to go through the manufacturers site, jump through hoops, and agree to some shady rights policy. I like the \\"digital copy\\", which is much easier to use. Don't recommend UltraViolet.
B0061S073A|5.0|you need this if you have children! been using it since first version an it keeps getting better with each update. I'm amazed this is still free!  it was the only app of its kind on the kindle fire on 12/11 a must have!

B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Let's start with the title - Drive. I think its' intent might cause a lot of people confusion. They're thinking very literally on that --  he's a driver, show driving. But I look at it as drive, what drives Gosling's character; what's his motivation? In the beginning, not much. He's a loner, no friends, only human connection is his boss, Cranston's character Shannon. Gosling is such a loner his character doesn't even have a name, he's just the driver. He makes human connections with his seemingly single neighbor and her son. This is why I gave it four rather than five stars. Mulligan isn't really single. She says her hubby is in jail yet she still goes out with Gosling? And who is watching her son when she's out cruising? And how can she afford that apt. working as a waitress? A common movie mistake -- home well out of a person's salary range. Oh wait, I also gave it four of five because it has intrusive, cheesy 80s style music. But, all in all, I found it had a quiet, compelling intensity and great performances, especially by Albert Brooks. I have yet to see a Gosling movie I haven't liked. For the record, no, I've never seen The Notebook.

B006OE7XM4|5.0|Five SUPERB Stars! Grammy-nominated jazz singer, composer Gregory Porter deals up a great sophomore recording that justifies the huge buzz in the jazz world created by his Grammy-nominated debut recording [[ASIN:B003JXUXPW Water]], his worldwide live appearances, and emergence on the international jazz polls. Bolstered by excellent sidemen: Tivon Pennicott, Yosuke Sato, and Kamau Kenyatta (also horn arranger) on saxophones, Keyon Harrold on brass, Chip Crawford on piano, bassist Aaron James, and Emanuel Harrold on drums, \\"Be Good\\" gives us engaging ballads, uptempo swingers, and mellow gospel-tinged message songs, such as the 'colors of life' in the powerful but tender \\"Painted on Canvas\\" and the excellent jazz waltz \\"Be Good (Lion's Song)\\". The beautiful, rarely-heard movie theme \\"Imitation of Life\\" gets a tender piano/voice treatment. The gospel-tinged \\"Mother's Song\\" has a powerful familial message. The hard-swinging \\"Bling Bling\\" has great uptempo scatting by Porter and a wild alto sax solo that is most impressive. \\"Real Good Hands\\" is a touching performance of a man asking parents for their daughter's hand. And perhaps best of all, Greg's powerful interpretation of Nat Adderley's classic \\"Work Song\\" gets one heck of a ride here with Porter's voice emoting those potent Oscar Brown Jr lyrics, aided by some inventive instrumental solos exploring Nat's chord changes through a dramatic arrangement. The 'a cappella' version of \\"God Bless the Child\\" is just a wonderful rendering with distinctive turns towards gospel and soul along the way, and the uplifting uptempo \\"On My Way To Harlem\\" is about things in life that change and other things that should never change. With each listen, these attractive songs and performances reveal more beauty and detail about the booming artistry of jazz singer Gregory Porter, his cohorts, and the care that went into production of this excellent vocal/instrumental recording and it is Highly Recommended. Five DISTINCTIVE Stars!! (This review is based on an mp3 download. 12 tracks; Time: ~62:03)iew is based on an mp3 download. 12 tracks; Time: ~62:03)

1451648537|5.0|I thought I knew a lot about Steve Jobs, from watching Apple. This book sheds a whole new light on his life, accomplishments, personality, and failures. I found myself not wanting to put it down, and wanting to read it every chance I got. I also found when reading it, additional drive for me to succeed in my own business. I would highly recommend this book.

1451629184|5.0|After spending 18 years as a prisoner Jaycee Dugard was let free.  She spent from the time she was kidnapped in 1991 to 2009 in the backyard of Philip and Nancy Garrido.  Somehow her location was able to remain a secret for nearly 2 decades.  Through out her her time spent as prisoner she gave birth to two girls.  Her life was far from normal.  She had been kidnapped by a convicted offender.  She gave birth at the ages for 14 and 17 and although she was the girls' mother she had to be introduced as their sister.  The main message of the book was don't assume what strangers want.  When the Garrido's car stopped, Jaycee thought they were just stopping to get directions.  Instead, they kidnapped her.  People are unpredictable, one might think they'll do one thing but they'll do the opposite.  This was the reality of Jaycee Dugard.  The day she was kidnapped will be the memory she'll never forget.  I liked the book because it explained how life was before she was abducted by the two, the years she was kept prisoner and the connections that were made after her release. The best part of the book was when Jaycee and her mom got reunited.  I can't imagine how the two felt.  My only objection to how the book was written are how she explained what Phillip did to her and the language that he used.  Someone should read this book because it's the story of a girl who was kidnapped and never give up hope.  This is the only book that Jaycee Dugard's written so there aren't any other books that can be recommended.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this book a 9 because it was about a girl's ability to keep the hope of being found after being prisoner for 18 years.  It's amazing how hard life was for her and how she could write a book on the thins she faced.  I'm actually surprised that she was able to write a book that reflected the darkest part of her life.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|Nicely built with a good heft, certainly feels more substantial than the i1 Display LT it is replacing.  I'm hoping to use it on a number of workstations and laptops including my main office workstation with two Dell 3008WFP 30\\" monitors.  It calibrated the first monitor fine although quite a bit darker than the i1Display after selecting a luminance of 140.  However nothing I do can get it to calibrate the other monitor - I've changed all of Windows settings for primary monitor, even tried rearranging the desktop - everything short of physically unplugging the other monitor from the video card (which likely will do it).  However the idiotic software still always moves the window over to the monitor it has already calibrated and starts calibrating it again.<br /><br />Is this really so HARD?  Couldn't whoever programmed this get it to follow the choice you select for Display 1 or Display 2 (it just ignores that) or even just look at what monitor the software window is on?<br /><br />I can probably force this to calibrate the 2nd monitor but it is really an epic FAIL that I have to go through this.  BTW I had no problem at all calibrating dual display workstations using my old i1Display LT unit which technically doesn't even support multiple displays.  After spending considerably more on this unit it is really too bad they couldn't do a better job with the software considering how nice the hardware appears to be.

B000FA5TTW|4.0|I havent had a chance to read a book that i choose in sometime because I was in school reading books that i didnt want to read and just turned me off from reading for a while. I saw the preveiws for the movie and wanted to see it, however as a rule i hav always stood beside sence watching A Walk to Remember repeatdly and than reading the book; i decided to read the book first. It took me a while to get into it because I never read about a rape/murder before but i got hooked and it was hard to put down. I would read untill my eyes were drooping shut. Thank God I had a kindle so i knew where i left off! :)<br /><br />Anyways, the story line is amazing, everything was amazing. Thanks to the Author getting me to read again!!! :)

AMERICANA got some cool punk tracks like HAVE YOU EVER, STARING AT THE SUN, END OF THE LINE and the mega hit THE KIDS AREN´T ALRIGHT, but also got some really POP moments... Anyway, if you like OFFSPRING you probably enjoy AMERICANA, but don´t be surprised by the clear evidence that those old punks are not hardcore anymore!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I breezed through this on a combination of my ipad and my iphone at work. Alot of people complained about technical aspects like the fonts, or the saved book place or anything they could think of. Switching between two different apps, it worked fine for me, it never lost my page I was reading, even switching between the iphone and ipad. The fonts aren't too much of a bother either. Sure it happened a few times, the font was slightly bigger or back to regular size, but I was too engrossed in reading for it to be a problem. Granted, I was switching between two different formats anyway. Bottom line: None of the low star reviews are applicable unless you're an English professor tasked with the job of grading the kindle version editor's work.<br /><br />The story was great, etc, of course, we knew that already or they wouldn't be making a movie out of it.

B005DZMP00|5.0|this double cd is worth it,if only for the blazing \\"dark star\\" and \\"the other one\\"on disc #2,you wont be sorry
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|We use this in our Honda Odyssey minivan to stream movies from an iPhone to the TV screen in the back seat.  The cables work great and even charge the iPhone while we drive on long trips.  The best part is since we have the movies on our iPhone, we can switch them out easily with a simple sync of iTunes so we don't have to worry about where the DVDs are or carrying a bunch of discs in the car.  Highly recommend for folks with kids, iPhones and a desire to watch some movies on long trips.
B006ON41FC|5.0|very fun game. I play it all the time and never get sick of it because every level has new goals set.
006197806X|5.0|This book was amazing, Lauren has outdone herself. I enjoyed reading this so much, the writing just flowed from start to finish.<br /><br />I had one big question starting this book. Did Alex survive? And a big part of me saying, \\"please let him be alive\\". I don't want to say \\"yay\\" or \\"nay\\" and spoil this book for anyone so I am going to review it without going too much into the storyline.<br /><br />Pandemonium is written in alternating chapters of 'now' and 'then'. In the 'now', we learn the story of Lena's emergence into the Wilds and how she deals with the struggles and hardships of this new way of life. A better way of life?<br /><br />Through the 'now', we see Lena working as part of the resistance, and she is about to embark on her first mission.<br /><br />The ambience of this book is very downbeat throughout. Lena really struggles with her new life in the Wilds and at times, even wonders if she wants to survive. Life is hard in every way and sickness and death are a regular occurrence without access to medical supplies and often, a shortage of food.<br /><br />There are a lot of new characters and I did lose track of who some of them were but it didn't impede on my following the story. The main characters are well written, identifiable and likeable.<br /><br />We see a completely different Lena than we did in Delirium. She grows into a much stronger person, in every way, character, mind and body. She is amazing.<br /><br />The ending of this book is explosive. While the book was suspenseful at times, I really didn't see the ending coming. It is probably the happiest part and my heart was in my mouth. Then it ends on one hell of a cliffhanger.<br /><br />In Delirium, we see life from one side of the fence, the Cureds. In Pandemonium, we get to see life from the other side, the Invalids. I can't wait to see what Requiem will hold for us.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|update screwed up the app.  kindle apps are very unimpressive!  I'm finding my kindle fire less and less useful by the day.
B003ES61EE|1.0|The pad side is a reversible small/medium pad. This means, it is designed to come out and come out it does! It is impossible to use because it will not stay in. I had bought this to replace the Nikon lens pen that I thought I lost. I was ecstatic to find my Nikon pen; this one's going in the trash.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love to play solitaire when there's time and this is a great edition of the classic game that has been enjoyed for years.
B006O3MU96|5.0|this is the best game ever!!!! I play it a lot me my friend John play it a lot my high is 26,789 and his is 200,000 something. me and him love it! we think its the best game tons of people have it. Such as my friend Owen,Kaiser,me,John and much much more. It is so.entertaining but on My Kindle Fire it's not free. It should be free tho. But I'm not saying it's a bad game because it's a awesome game. Me and John always text back and fourth about it. So you can see I am their #1 fan.<br /><br />  So I am just reviewing games or I should say app. If you get a 5outof5 it's good.<br /><br />  If you don't it might be a bad app or a Kinda good app.<br /><br />  I love playing it on my Kindle!!!!!!!!!
145162445X|4.0|A very interesting book.  Written mostly for a layman to understand, but some of the concepts are difficult to comprehend. Worth reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|good,  hard,  challenging,  with interesting graphics.  great game!<br />any age, yet tough. keeps your mind sharp as a tack, which can also pop your drop!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a very fun matching game. This game has easy to follow instructions. No problems on my Kindle Fire.
1451627289|3.0|I won't be redundant, after speed reading some reviews as I did some of this novel, it has all been touched on - the good and the bad. I would just have to say that I was disappointed. Were my expectations too high, given the two key subjects (JFK's fate & time travel)?<br />I need to point out two errors to this editor. One: JFK's daughter's name is CAROLINE, not Carolyn. How could you not know that or research it to be sure, if you didn't? Two: the Star Wars reference to SNOWtroopers? Really? I have one question for anyone who might read this and I hope someone will answer it for me: How old would Sadie have been if Jake was able to bring her 'back to the future' with him? Jake aged just during his travels. Wouldn't she have been TOO old for a life with him?<br />Thank you!
0142410322|5.0|This is an incredible book. The book has multiple characters and each character is unique and very descriptive. My daughter also enjoyed it and we read together for several days. The poems are outstanding. The story weaves through in a nice way, and is very enjoyable. The morals are excellent for kids - don't eat too much, don't watch too much TV etc. How to be conservative on money and not spend too much are all explained very well with great examples.
B0058A119G|5.0|First noticed and enjoyed Barbra doing Alan & Marilyn Bergman songs in exquisite \\"The Way We Were\\" album, noticing how she went deep inside those gorgeous songs with depth and vocal beauty that is rare & stunning to experience over and over, making vintage song disc a good reason to get \\"Deluxe Version\\" of \\"What Matters Most\\", thinking second CD would be the winner in this 2 Disc set but what a surprise...Barbra sounds magnificent throughout classic new recording, singing with emotional depth and vocal beauty that has been her alluring hallmark for decades. Every song is a wondrous gem flowing from one sublime glorious performance to another, hypnotic delights like \\"Solitary Moon\\" or beautifully sung \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\" highly enjoyable. Barbra Streisand has once again set the bar high giving the world another classic masterwork to be savored and enjoyed over and over and for years to come! \\"Nice 'N' Easy\\" given a new life being a nice mix of a gorgeous seductive vocal surrounded by a richly romantic arrangement with cool jazz inflections featuring nice 'n' easy Chris Botti on Trumpet...stellar performance of \\"That Face\\" is given an appealing big-band workout, another exotic gem \\"So Many Stars\\" is dreamy with a lush Brazilian arrangement featuring a vocal that is so fine.  Chris Botti on Trumpet gives mesmerizing moody feel to \\"Alone In The World\\", haunting beautiful new classic from one of the greatest singers of her generation and for all time, doing what she does best...Bravo Barbra, thank you for a magical collection of sublime performances!<br />Deluxe Version second disc opens with gorgeous classic \\"The Way We Were\\" sounding hauntingly beautiful all these years later, most timeless gems come from \\"The Way We Were\\" Lp that always has been high on the list of all time great works from the peerless singer. Rare at the time live performance of these great songs was performed at Los Angeles Dorothy Chandler Pavillion in 1980, billed as benefit concert honoringthe songs of Alan & Marilyn Bergman, obtaining tickets to this rare event required being in line day of sale at 6am but the effort was a grandly rewarding, experiencing Barbra singing \\"What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?\\", \\"Pieces Of Dreams\\" and other classic Alan & Marilyn Bergman gems live was a religious experience as that tremendous voice filled the grand & elegant theater...finale \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\" stunned the audience with unannounced surprise appearance by Neil Diamond appearing from rear orchestra in sparkling black sequined shirt...meeting on stage at opposite ends, grand finale still memorable to those of us lucky to attend all these years later. Other sumptuous treats contained in this magnificent collection are among the finest songs from the great singers catalog with \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me\\" and \\"Piece Of The Sky\\" from \\"Yentl\\" extraordinary performances, finding Barbra Streisand in stunning peak vocal form, surrounded by the genius of Michel Legrand...doesn't get better than that!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is fabulous! The characters are well written and the story line kept me reading. I have re read this book 4 times since i bought it. I love this book. Well done!
B004XNGKBS|5.0|much faster then typing notes in class, no typos by accident. yet still have the option to type with the keyboard
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the fact that it runs smooth, it gives you scoring options. Best of all it was free.<br /><br />Thanks
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is an entertaining version of Spider & I have been playing for a couple of weeks now. Good movement, clear images & no freezing. Free and helps to kill time whilst waiting patiently for Life to call your name so get it and play it.  Phrasing...
B00269FOHM|4.0|This is a very sexy movie. A total chick flick. Sophie Marceau plays an impoverished young woman of the early 19th century who gives birth to the child of a wealthy man whose wife is in a very convenient coma. She takes the money; he takes the child and she regrets the deal. She's luminous and Stephen Dillane is oh so English as we wait for him to succumb to her charms.
1595827684|4.0|The contents of this hardcover book are amazing!  The book's of a decent size (9.25\\" x 12\\" @ 182 high-gloss pages) with rich shades of colour that include paintings and 3D mockups spanning the entire Mass Effect trilogy.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy the evolution of character, weapon and location designs!  The horrors of the Reaper-victim enemies are reminiscent of H.R. Gieger and among my favourites in the book!  Sadly, the book is missing some character designs from the upcoming Mass Effect 3 but the major characters look impressive enough. I would have also appreciated the novel covers (which are missing in this book).<br /><br />My biggest complaint - the anonymity of the grunts that churned out this artwork.  Why do I care about what Casey Hudson and Derek Watts have to say when neither really had anything to do with the creation of this book's contents?<br /><br />Seriously, the video games industry needs fewer figureheads and more credit where it's due.
B00006690G|5.0|This album by far is my personal favorite in the EMINEM series as I like to call it.<br />From Curtains Up to Curtains Close this cd is worth buying for every track on it.<br />I have been a huge EMINEM fan since the Slim Shady Lp had hit shelfs but then again I live in a little ass town in PA and when I say fan I mean like crazed fan. But anyway back to the product. The Eminem Show unlike the other albums has one thing the rest dont, differance, it isnt him just complaining about his own problems but him complaining about all the struggle not just him but the whole world has to deal with. At the same time he keeps that pissed off soldier inside Slim Shady on every track so all of use huge EMINEM fans can still be sucked right in. From White America to Cleanin Out my Closet or to the catchy beats from Dr. Dre behind EM's lyrical genius on Without Me. There is sure to be atleast 4 songs on the cd any rap fan will relate to or enjoy. At this point EM's getting older and you can definetly tell.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun to play and very addictive.  Great way to kill time but hard to put down. I sometimes have to make myself turn the game off.
B000683VI4|1.0|Although I enjoy a good romantic drama, I found this movie to be empty romanticism, totally irrelevant to real life mostly because of the ending. If they were both Christians, whose souls were going to meet the Lord after departing their lifeless bodies, then dying in each others arms could have been seen as providing final temporal comfort. However, they were godless and he worshiped her (see Romans chapter 1 to see what God thinks about humans who worship humans); therefore, in dying their souls entered into torment after leaving their lifeless bodies (so says Jesus on many occasions in the gospels).<br /><br />Another problem was the their relationship was based on immorality and deceit. Yeah, they had a lot of passion, but could they really establish trust and love for one another upon such a foundation?<br /><br />Consider a couple of Bible verses that apply to their manner of finding comfort in each other to the death:<br />Psalm 146:4 When his breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day, his plans perish.<br />Proverbs 11:7 When the wicked dies, his hope will perish, and the expectation of wealth perishes too [the wicked are those who neglect God].<br /><br />Before I was a Christian, I would not have been troubled by this movie.<br /><br />A movie based on another of his books, A Walk To Remember, was much more enjoyable, they acknowledged God therein.
B005EXA8LY|2.0|I agree with all that the reviewers have written. He did a fantastic job on the KC 5.1 mixes and remastering. If you like moody, dramatic, slowly evolving soundscapes that are mostly pensive then your patience in listening might reveal more and more in this recording. My taste runs broadly, but I prefer music that has a lighter mood and is less brooding. I love music where ther is lots of rhythm and rhythmic interplay,interesting harmonies, and  can take some challenging chord structures with patience that what sounds odd at first listen may become a unique fresh music that has more staying power for you. I like Frank Zappa, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Captain Beefheart, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, etc. etc. However, this music will be forever shelved at my house. Very well produced and it is not an expensive purchase for such a high quality Blu Ray audio, if you think you might like it.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I always purchase all of this authors books. This one is so bad it was not worth the money or time to read. I think sometimes they rely on people like me who buy whatever they write. No, I will need some better stories and writing to come back here.
0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games was probably one of the best books I have ever read. It was a roller coaster that kept throwing you curve balls the whole way through. It is about a girl named Katniss who takes her sister's place in something called the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a last-stand kill all type of game. Ms. Collins made it so you couldn't put this book down. Every page you read seemed like something big was about to happen and you had to keep reading. I lost a lot of sleep because I was reading this book so much. An excellent book to read I highly suggest it, and the others that follow it too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool series is an amazing piece of fiction.  It sucks you in, chews you up, and won't let you escape!  The only major negative thing to be said about this is that the series is not complete.  After I finished Wool 4 I'd check back in over and over waiting and waiting for 5...now I will be waiting for 6 :(<br /><br />Thanks for such an excellent piece of literary magic.  Anxiously awaiting your future work!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a very simple yet fun and addictive game. One of the games I play the most when I have a little time to kill.
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|This review does not reflect on Pink Floyd's classic 1979 album, \\"The Wall\\", but is a commentary on the new Immersion Box Set which is nothing short of a rip-off.  \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" were overpriced and came with items fans didn't want such as scarves, marbles, and coasters.  However they did come with rare live versions of those albums as well as audio versions of the albums on DVD and Blu ray.  They also came with the visuals that were shown during the concert which is fun to watch.<br /><br />With \\"The Wall\\" Immersion set fans get the album as well as two CD's of outtakes and rough drafts which one can by as a cheaper deluxe version. Also included is a remastered version of \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" which I can't imagine anyone who doesn't already own it would want it. What is missing here?  No DVD or Blu Ray 5.1 mixes.  Nor are they any of the many visuals which were shown during The Wall concerts in 1980 - 1981.  And I am sure I was not the only fan who was hoping for a CD of 1982 \\"The Wall\\" motion picture soundtrack with Bob Geldof's vocals on both versions of \\"In The Flesh\\" and the rare studio version of, \\"What Shall We Do Now?\\"  The Immersion Box Set of \\"The Wall\\" could have been so much more, and for the price tag it should have been so much more.  People who don't care about the silly swag should just go stick with the four CD deluxe edition.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is really fun! fly through different challenges collecting nuts and missing the evils as they pop up. you do start over every time, that is the only down fall.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I've been looking for this DVD at a reasonable price for some time and came across a gently used one for a great price.  It arrived quickly and couldn't even tell it was used! Plays great and very happy with the purchase.

1932735410|5.0|This is the book to use if you are going to take the PMP exam, which was updated in August 2011. I've heard a lot of people talking about how the changes to the exam were just moving the professional and social responsibility questions around. That claim seemed odd to me, since PMI announced a 30% change to the exam. That's a pretty high percentage--much higher than the 9% of questions that the old exam dedicated to professional and social responsibility. So I decided to check for myself. I had an old version of the exam content outline from PMI (I had planned to take the exam before the change, but...life always gets in the way, right?). I compared that old version to the new one for the updated exam. There were definitely more substantial changes than just moving some questions around. Some tasks were removed entirely from the outline, there were a few new ones, and others were worded so differently and ambiguously that I couldn't tell if it was a change or not. So I got the 7th edition book, and I wasn't disappointed. This new edition appears to have captured the changes to the updated exam. It worked for me anyway--I passed! I am now a PMP!<br /><br />Overall, this book is a very user-friendly way to prepare for the PMP exam, and it's one of the few books out there that was updated for the 2011 exam changes. The tone is direct and conversational, and I found the exercises and tips for passing the exam the first time to be especially helpful. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to become a PMP!
B0063GORYU|1.0|I did not enjoy this game at all, It was quite ill made and I was glad to get it off my device
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my son loves these games they are challenging enough but not too challenging that he can not do it himself

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game to pass time with. i wish it had more difficult games though. But overall really good.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its really cool. I have always loved it but I like it more when its on sale.....so yes. but a five star review is nessasary.
B0063IH60K|4.0|you play cards with yourself. no one else...just you. if you want to play with others you need a different game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|one of the best games I have played in a while.  I play it 24/7 sooooo fun I can't put it down!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been working my way through the discounted and free Kindle ebooks available, and thought I'd take a chance on this well-reviewed and very inexpensive piece. I'm glad I did. It's easily one of the better pieces of apocalyptic fiction I've read -- character-driven, deeper than it at first appears, and generally well-paced -- and possesses just the right combination of reflective inner narrative and visceral (but not particularly graphic) action to make the whole thing hard to put down until it's finished. I can't describe too much about the plot without touching on some major spoilers, so I'll just end with a strong recommendation. \\"Wool\\" is one of the best books -- print or otherwise -- that I've read this year, and this has actually been a pretty good year for books. At under five dollars, this should be an instant buy.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I expected a lot from the duo Verbinski/Depp and I was not disappointed. Both me and my 10 y.o. daughter we spend a great cinema moment together watching \\"Rango\\" and I recommend this movie for a whole family evening, as it is a typical \\"kidult\\" (kid+adult) movie. In fact, when I looked, there were more adults than kids in the cinema and they were all having a really great time!<br /><br />The reasons why this movie is so good are many, and I will try to enumerate the more important, avoiding the spoilers as much as possible:<br /><br />1) It is a really really good, solid classical western, with all the necessary ingredients: a lawless town (named Dirt), a mysterious lone stranger, a cemetery filled with dead sheriffs, a cute (although tough) senorita in dire straits, a bank robbery, a saloon filled with the scum of the earth, a joyful merry undertaker (which is only normal - his is the only prospering business in Dirt), a deadly evil gunfighter who ALWAYS \\"takes a soul\\" in every town he visits, an Indian tracker (who molts, but we shall not hold it against him, shall we?) and also desperadoes, buzzards, posses, dynamite, old timers with shotguns, youngsters with Colts, hillbillies with Gatling machine guns, booze galore, Far West stories, coffee and beans around a campfire, mariachis on the cactuses and let's not forget the seven brothers killed with one bullet...)))<br /><br />2) Johny Depp gives to Rango more than just his voice - this lizard IS Johny Depp! And also by placing in his mouth some of the lines from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", Johny Depp made me relieve some of the best moments of this franchise. There were moments when I half expected seeing Barbossa behind that Gatling machine gun!<br /><br />3) The Spirit of the West - as a wise old armadillo called Roadkill teaches Rango, \\"the Spirit of the West rides in a white chariot with a guard of golden warriors\\" - and indeed he does! And I guarantee you that when you finally meet yourself the Spirit of the West you will spill the soda on your pants and choke on your popcorn, like half of the public did (me included) when we were watching it in the cinema! I almost died laughing at this moment (although my daughter did not get the joke - and I think most of the kids will not get it either). No more spoilers here about The Spirit of the West!<br /><br />4) Visually and graphically this is a very well done movie, quite unique in style, unlike anything else made by Pixar or Dreamworks. In fact I really hope that Nickelodeon Movies will carry on, because this style of movie making completes very pleasantly the offer on the market of kid (and kidult) movies. VERY good job on the visual aspect of this movie!<br /><br />To keep the things short I will not say much more and I will just invite you to see it in the cinema if you still can and then to enjoy it on DVD. And I am all in favor of a sequel, in which we could hear for example an old grumpy one eyed rat saying: \\"Fill yer hands, rascals!\\" before charging ahead with his Colts blazing!West you will spill the soda on your pants and choke on your popcorn, like half of the public did (me included) when we were watching it in the cinema!

B0059ILFJ8|5.0|Sounds great and this makes me wonder if some of my other 180gm pressings are as heavy as they claim
B0036T31YY|5.0|If you are a fan of Twilight Zone, Donnie Darko, the Shining then you will like this film.  This is not a slasher film or a film about the Bermuda Triangle.  Although there is gore, its more atmospheric (i.e creepy) than anything else and the ending makes you think.  It is a film about cheating death or perhaps about trying to cheat death.  That is one of the fun part about this film - you can't help but wonder about the whys and the underlying subplot that were hinted at but leaves you wondering and build upon.<br /><br />I started watching this film thinking it's another cheesy Bermuda Triangle film but had to reassess as soon as I noticed that the characters are not your typical cheesy B movie actors.  They actually can act.  So I decided I should pay it some attention.  Once the characters board the large ship the weirdness and creepiness starts and I. Just. Loved. It.<br /><br />At some point in the first half of the film, you might start to wonder where this is going and might be tempted to fast forward.  Stay with it.  Do not fast forward and skip.  Each cycle does reveal something and helps you understand the character development.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I love Dexter, I think that it is the best thriller on the television at the moment. I cant wait to watch season 6 In Australia we don't get it until next year. Just finished season 5.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This was a great movie. Very informative. I was raised on a chicken farm and it is awsome that the poultry industry is really shown here. It is completely true. I have had two uncles go under do to the chicken companies. Again great movie. Not just for the left wing liberals.

142311339X|5.0|Jason is on a bus in the middle of the desert.  He is with Piper, his girlfriend, and Leo, his best friend.  The only problem is, he has no recollection of anything that happened to him before waking up on the bus.  Then the trio are attacked by a monster and rushed off to Camp Half-Blood, where they learn they are demigods.<br /><br />But all three of them have secrets, potentially deadly secrets.  They must ban together on a quest to free the goddess Hera before the winter solstice.  But will their secrets tear them apart?<br /><br />While this may be the first in a new series, it definitely is a follow up to the Percy Jackson series.  While Percy is missing in this book, several other characters from that series make appearances, and the events of book 5 are discussed.  So don't start here.<br /><br />But do read this book.  Yes, at times it seemed over long, but I'm not sure what I would cut out.  The action and mystery never lets up until the end.  The characters were wonderful.  I love all three of the main ones and wanted to see them succeed even against overwhelming odds.<br /><br />If this is any indication of what we have to look forward to with the rest of this series, I can't wait to read more.  It's a great adventure novel for kids of all ages.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This is the best game in the world I cant wit to get atom and Zeus. but needs twin cities too put best if you love it.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|This is a tough movie for me to rate. It's more of a 2.5 star for me having so much love for the '82 version.<br />The Thing itself was too \\"CGI'd\\" for my tastes and didn't really change forms all that much. They really needed Rob Bottin and his practical special effects for this film, which was a star in itself in the Carpenter version. I was almost wishing for a lower budgeted film that may not have relied so much on CGI.<br />The best parts of the film were actually the \\"nods\\" of what was to come in the Carpenter version: An axe left in the wall, the double-faced Thing, the dog-chase at the end, etc.<br />Good acting and somewhat of a decent backstory.

B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I am always a fan of character-driven movies, and they are rare in the sci-fi/fantasy genres. This movie is really the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The transformation of Jodie's character through the movie is subtle and heart-breaking. It's hard to imagine who else could have come close to pulling off this role as she did. Sci-Fi movies of course never win best actor/actress awards, but she was nominated for Golden Globe for this role.<br /><br />There is an interesting article about this film on Wikipedia, that discusses the \\"screen-writing hell\\" the film ended up in for years. Multiple directors, a parade of writers that came and went... And the film is flawed, no doubt. (The main antagonist, played by the wonderfully slimy Tom Skerritt, dies half way through the film.) But the acting is wonderful all around.<br /><br />I bought the movie on DVD, and watched the lengthy special mini-documentary about the making of the film. The vast majority of the special effects shots in the movie are not in the more sci-fi scenes, but in the normal, day-to-day scenes -- a crane shot of her house as a young child that zooms in and pushes right through the window into the room where shes sitting, for example (the window wasnt there, of course: the window, the trees reflecting in it and even the finger prints on it were all animated). There are dozens of those kinds of shots in the movie that are breath-taking once you start paying attention to them.

B004ZNAXX2|4.0|As others have mentioned in other reviews, this \\"immersion\\" edition is a little light.  There is no Bluray audio discs, no \\"The Wall\\" movie, surround sound, quad sound, or any other fancy audiophile temptations.  However, I love the two discs worth of demos and \\"works in progress\\".  Can you live without this \\"immersion\\" edition?  Most likely.  However, for an album I have absolutely loved and sang along to for 20+ years, it was worth it to me.<br /><br />Now time to get back and listen to some more \\"Doctor, Doctor\\", \\"Teacher, Teacher\\", and the other demo jewels included.  Despite not being in 5.1 surround, they sound FABULOUS to me.
B003L20ICE|5.0|i have watched this movie numerous times. very touching at times, funny at others. America should wake up and realize that just because the same sex wants to be together that doesnt mean that there wont be a normal life for all involved. just what is normal anyways? juilanne moore gives one of the best performances of her time in my opinion. definitely give this movie 2 big thumbs up!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I put the DVD on my wish list sometime before the Christmas holidays.  When it on sale in the store, I forgot about it.  Fortunately, I saved my money to see it on cable.  Knowing someone who stammers, I was familiar with Bertie's frustration.  It was a learning experience, proving with effort one can conquer almost anything.  There is a bit of wittiness in the movie, too.  I enjoyed it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I've had this case since I got my Kindle Fire in November.  It really works great.  I use the foldable stand when watching movies or reading somewhere with a table when I want my hands free.  It doesn't slide around or collapse, even during mild turbulence on a plane.  The case is great for protecting the screen when I toss it in my purse or backpack.  I've even dropped it a couple times, and no harm, no foul.  My only tiny complaint would be that the soft lining on the screen side loves cat hair.  My snazzy black case now has a nice layer of cat hair and fuzz.  Other than that, no complaints!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nag screens asking me to rate their game all the time is rather annoying, but overall, the game is my new favorite. This deserves 5 stars, even with the nagging, a good buy and well worth it.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett proves that musicians are young at heart and continue to find new ways to present their music.  The duets offered on this CD are absolutely amazing and offer a few surprises!  Josh Groban and Michael Buble are their usual excellent self.  But Lady Gaga's jazz and scat singing in The Lady is a Tramp is some of the best singing I have heard.  She is a cross between Eydie Gorme and Ella Fitzgerald.  This is one of the best CDs I have purchased lately.

It's difficult to actually COMPARE it, since there is no effective competition. Sure, there are some that come close -- and some folks might PREFER one of the competitor apps. But why settle? This IS the one you want! Not sure how it does abroad, but in these United States, it has no peers.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This is the BEST invention!!! PERFECT size and weight for babies of all ages. It's not tiny and stays great in babies mouth. Nothing bad to say about this AWESOME invention.<br /><br />I have purchased a few to have around our big two story home and car. I also purchased the red dragon and another monkey that looks like he is wearing pj's which is the one we use for bed/nap times. Very easy to find if baby takes it out while playing or sleeping. I also just throw it in the wash on gently cycle and let air dry. It dries in less than an hour too.<br /><br />Do Not hesitate DEFINITELY BUY!!! You will not regret it...

B006ZJJ70O|5.0|Here is a reissue that is going to make many music lovers and potential Stokowski fans very happy, and many Marketplace sellers very frustrated. Not very Christian of me, but I don't pity the latter very much. It is a straight reissue of the [[ASIN:B000003G1H Stokowski ~ Stereo Collection]], for which the best offer, at the time of writing, is 180 (and the \\"worst\\", an egregious 400). I'll let you figure out the buyer's savings - and how many fingers the hapless and too greedy sellers of the original box will now want to bite away.<br /><br />Of course, the guys like me who had missed the original box and painstakingly stalked the individual issues at reasonable prices may feel some frustration - but I'll be Christian here and think not of myself, but of the future generations of Stokowskites who won't have most of this already and who are offered a fabulous bargain.<br /><br />Many of these recordings are among Stokowski's last. His very last recordings were made in 1977 with the National Philharmonic Orchestra for Columbia (Brahms' 2nd Symphony and Tragic Overture in April and Bizet's Symphony and Mendelsssohn's Italian Symphony in June). Many here are from 1973 to 1975. Some of those late ones are even recording firsts for Stokie - and last, of course (Coriolan Overture, Brahms Academic Overture, Khachaturian's Third Symphony, Shostakovich's 6th and Age of Gold...)<br /><br />Here are the contents, and the links to the original CDs (since I'm allowed only ten product links in the review I'll send the rest to the comments section).

My answer: invest in both. Except for the Bach transcriptions the repertoires don't overlap, the choice is slightly more catholic here (with Beethoven, Brahms, Rimsky, Tchaikovsky, Wagner) but the EMI box is great if you are in for early 20th century music and, really, the repertoires are complementary (and nowhere more than with the two Khachaturian symphonies, the 2nd on EMI and the 3rd on RCA/Sony). One factor might be that, the RCA/Sony compilation features later recordings (the EMI ones are all from the late 1950s). And look at the prices!
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|As I write this there are 22 posted reviews which should give readers a good idea of the performances on this DVD.  However, many of the comments make a comparison with the recent performances at the Met.  I have seen that production both at the Met and in the HD broadcasts (which presumably will be released on DVD soon).  There are those who are waiting for the Met performance, but in my opinion, the Vienna production is superior on all counts.  Vocally there will not be much to choose from in Netrebko's performances, but Garencia is a marvel, and the rest of the cast holds up very well.  Visually, the Met performance prided it self on authenticity, but authenticity does not necessarily translate in to theatricality. The whole visual aspect of the Vienna performance is much more satisfying.  From my point of view there is no need to wait.  If you are only going to buy one this is it.
B0078XMA6O|2.0|I was a fan of the Cranberries in the 90's and am fairly disappointed with Roses, their first full album release since Wake Up and Smell the Coffee in 2001.  The Cranberries were never known for great lyrics, but Roses is a poor showing even by those standards.  Most of the songs are fairly vacuous and there seems to be little to no emotional investment in the music.  The music is also mellow and a lot of the album puts me to sleep compared to their earlier work.  In general, Roses just seems flat and devoid of energy.  That problem is exacerbated by the fact that every song suffers from clipping and there is no discernible dynamic range.  Maybe this album would sound a lot different if they hadn't pushed the volume up so high during mastering, but it's hard to say.

B000005RY7|3.0|3 I've always felt that in order to rate a greatest hits package properly, you have to look at the overall offering of tracks (these are, after all, supposed to be \\"great\\") and any extras that the album comes with (whether it be new songs, liner notes, or some type of freebie).  Killers came out in an era when CDs were still out of reach for mainstream music lovers and the LP and cassette tape ruled.<br /><br />While KISS is well known for giving their fans plenty of freebies (such as stickers, tattoos, and a punch-out \\"Love Gun\\"), Killers came with nothing new or free with the exception of four tracks.  The album was originally only released outside of the United States, and in true KISS fashion, there were multiple versions of it available for the buying public.  There was the original European version, a Japanese version featuring two extra tracks, an Australian version with two extra tracks, and a German version known primarily for having two backwards \\"zz\\" letters instead of the traditional stylized \\"ss\\" on KISS' logo due to the fact that the \\"ss\\" in the band's traditional logo resembles the old Nazi \\"SS\\" insignia.<br /><br />I have the German version of the album on compact disc.  The cover features the altered KISS logo and a photo of the band from their Music From The Elder album shoot.  It also features bright pink and blue graphics.<br /><br /> Musically, the album focuses primarily on tunes from Destroyer and Dynasty with nods to KISS and a live version of Rock And Roll All Nite.  The four new tracks have heavy power pop influences and would have fit comfortably on Unmasked.  The new songs are I'm A Legend Tonight, Down On Your Knees, Nowhere To Run, and Partners In Crime.  To be very honest, none of these tracks are worth buying the album for.  While they aren't bad songs, they just don't stand up to the hits in this package.  Nowhere To Run sounds like an early version of Thrills In The Night, aaa song that would appear on the group's 1984 album Animalize.  Down On Your Knees was co-written by Mikel Japp and Bryan Adams....yes, THAT Bryan Adams!<br /><br />Paul Stanley supplies vocals for all four of the new songs and Bob Kulick (brother of future KISS guitarist Bruce Kulick) plays guitars on the tracks in place of Ace Frehley who was well on his way out of the band by the time Killers hit store shelves.<br /><br />The album features an edited version of Shout It Out Loud, Detroit Rock City, and I Was Made For Lovin' You.  The edits are subtle and won't be noticed by general listeners of the group.<br /><br />Hardcore fans originally wanted this album because of its rarity outside of the US, but CDs, import sales, and the web have made it just another greatest hits package to own.  The German version is very easy to find and unless you just have to have every version of every album KISS ever released, I'd stick with the German version as the one to purchase.<br /><br />This is probably the most radio-friendly greatest hits release for general listeners to own.  It features tracks from the group's peak of popularity such as Love Gun and God Of Thunder, and leaves out lesser known tracks from the band's earlier albums (excepting Cold Gin, which is from their debut album).<br /><br /> The new tracks are forgettable and not really reason enough to buy this album, but for a casual fan, this is a decent purchase.  Hardcore fans and completionists such as myself will buy it simply because it is a KISS album.<br /><br />Recommended to casual fans and fans of greatest hits albums.ze.

0762434279|4.0|The book was true to description and although the description stated that it was a miniature edition I figured that it would still be of readable size.  This book is smaller than most children's books and can fit in the palm of your handle.  Make sure to read the details, you may just get what you ask for and more.
0446547654|5.0|This book was amazing!! Great read. I loved the older romance in this book. The 40ish man and woman meeting after a 20+ year separation by life events and the wonderful reunion. The book has many twists and turns at every corner and although the best of me was extremely exciting and heart stopping at times, I really was wanting a different ending. But I thought it was exceptionally written and it held my interest throughout. I could not put this book down. I was so exhilarated at the end of the book, I just wanted to talk about it to everyone. This was also the first Nicholas Sparks book I have ever read. I have since read 3 more!! GREAT BOOK!!

B000069KE0|5.0|These guys never got that much \\"prog rock\\" respect,\\" but they were, at their best, perhaps a \\"prog pop\\" band, and this album, with its extended suites, along with several individual gems, is their signature album.  What band has THREE writers (four counting Cetera) and THREE lead vocalists.  They rock, they swing, they can out-pop anyone, and then they show serious classical music chops, and throw in a little funk.  Wow, as one reviewer wrote here, is right.  They were lumped in with the more bluesy, less adventurous (except that first album with Al Kooper), Blood, Sweat & Tears, but they had a lot more to offer at the time.<br /><br />I heard they drove the record company crazy with their extended jams and overly long singles that would have to be edited down for time.  Giving this a listen, you'll hear how inspired they were at this point (long before they cranked out shlock like \\"You're the Inspiration\\"--pretty but cliched).  Bobby Lamm was at his peak as a writer on the first two albums, and Pankow's \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchanan\\" is a masterpiece (I know I'm repeating myself, but it really is).<br /><br />On the other hand, some of the sixties rhetoric--the hand-wringing idealism of \\"It Better End Soon\\" and the free love justification of \\"The Road\\" seem really dated now.  But that's just nitpicking, and they were a product of their times.<br /><br />Too bad that they eventually became so slick and packaged.  Few bands combined professional musicianship (NO BAND had chops like this in those days) and creativity with pop sensibility like this. Truly an amazing band.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|Aren't games usually played by kids?  I know I bought this game for mine.  It is illegal to spy on them!  Buyer Beware!  The new upgrade wants full internet access, full access to contacts, location access, and full control over the camera to take both stills and videos.  Why do you need the ability to film whomever is using the device, get their location, get at their contact info, and then upload this all to someone over the internet?  These permissions easily allow the actions of a stalker, spy, or pedophile.  Why do they need them?<br /><br />These new permissions come with no explanation that I can find.  What privacy policy do I need to monitor daily for change to find out if these are being abused? I can't seem to find one at all.  I can find a policy for the fruit ninja online store at [...] and the website [...], but neither of these seem to have anything to do with the app. A Google search for Fruit Ninja Android Privacy Policy did not give me any useful results that I could find and I can't seem to find one in the game.<br /><br />If I was Amazon I would review this children's game ASAP since it seems to be putting in place the ability to spy in ways that are not legal(at least when kids are involved).  It's kind of ironic that my kids cannot post on Amazon because they aren't 13, but this kids game at least has the permission to illegally spy on them.<br /><br />READ THOSE PERMISSION PAGES!  JUST BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT THE APP DOESN'T MEAN THEY AREN'T HACKING YOU!<br /><br />Maybe these permissions were just listed as a mistake, or are for valid but not obvious reasons.  Maybe this game comes with a rock solid Privacy Policy that is not revokable, just really hard to find. If so then maybe I will delete or change this review.  I sincerely hope that the developer replies to this and fixes these issues.  If not, please beware.  These permissions are way over the top and allow for scary and abusive results!
B004EPZ00M|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of the original Johnny English movie, and also a fan of Atkinson... all I can ask is WHAT HAPPENED??  This was a movie that I WANTED to like so much and it almost felt awkward watching scenes that you could tell were SUPPOSED to be funny but fell short rather terribly.  This is a case where I blame the writers completely, as I had no issues with Rowan Atkinson's performance, and I thought Gillian Anderson was a neat casting choice but there are just too many weak moments to save this film.  Sure, we've got a bigger budget this time so they upped the scale of action sequences, etc. - but that's not what you watch this movie for.<br /><br />There were TWO scenes that brought me to the floor laughing, so I didn't regret seeing it completely, and sure enough they happened to be somewhat minimal moments where Atkinson commanded the screen.  If your a fan of the original feel free to take a rental peek, but by no means don't purchase this film blindly.  I can't imagine them even attempting a 3rd film after this, such a shame.  They should have brought his talented and hilarious side kick Bough (Ben Miller) back.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|The first I had heard of Lana Del Rey was on the SNL.<br />Sure the performance was not perfect, but I certainly didn't think it was as bad as all the hype would lead you to believe.<br />I can recall seeing Florence and the Machine's first performance on SNL as not perfect either (their second performance on SNL from the cerimonials album was much better)<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a listen to all the tracks on my paid online streaming service, I thought it was very interesting.<br />So I decided to buy the deluxe version here on Amazon.<br />Have to say this is the best album I have heard in a while.<br />Many others here have already gone into detail on the tracks, so I won't.<br /><br />Some tracks remind me of Kate Bush or Sarah Brightman while others remind me of something like Enigma.<br /><br />I say, listen to the music and decide for yourself if you like it.<br />Not everyone likes every type of music, but I believe this one is a keeper.

B000YABYLA|5.0|I should state, first off, that, though this is a pro-life comedy, if anyone dares try to say that this is pro-life propoganda, zip your lip- your ignorance is showing. Why? Let me explain.<br />This movie goes with the thought of expectancy- that teenage girls this day and age don't know how to control theirselves. Rather typical. Then again, with a lack of common sense in today's academic world, that's likely to be expected. Girl finds out she's pregnant after the only time she's ever had sex (yep, that happens), and with her next-to-only friend, a rather average guy that's somewhere between a typical nerd and typical jock, yet is neither.<br />Her parents, though they don't expect it, decide to help her... after she tries to get an abortion. Funny thing is, the one-person protest crowd outside the abortion mill (showing how popular that stance is in the general populace) has a decent conversation with Juno (likely because they know each other as acquaintances). Inside the \\"clinic,\\" the discomfort actually gets pretty comical with the smallest of sounds getting to Juno, along with a goth-looking front desk lady who doesn't know how to sound intelligent, but is still obnoxiously funny.<br />So, she had the choice and chance to get an abortion, even to hear politically correct terms for an unborn child (\\"fetus,\\" \\"cluster of cells,\\" \\"not human yet\\"), yet she gets out (with the praise of that one-girl crowd), and decides to ask her friends and family for help.<br />If anyone expects total realism and a reality check for single teen mothers, here's a reality check: this is a comedy, not a church flick, so it would likely offend a totally complacent Christian expecting seriousness or a pro-choicer (that's a given anyway).<br />From quippy one-liners to certain camera angles, this movie does quite a bit to have some fun with real-life issues, rather than force it in your face the grotesque reality of the thigns that happen, but not all that happens in this film are cheery-go-lucky on the \\"brighter\\" side of the fence either.<br />The couple that want to adopt Juno's unborn child (she doesn't want to know the kid's sex, wants it to be a surprise to herself as well as to the adoptive parents) start to have marriage issues when the \\"expecting\\" father suddenly isn't sure if he wants to be a parent. During the ultrasound scene, the nurse makes a clear implication of her pro-life stance and gets chewed out by Juno's stepmom- now that's pretty jaw-dropping to hear her get in defense of her \\"dumb*** stepdaughter\\" and actually get the nurse to apologize.<br />And then the birthing scene (home of the only actual f-bomb in the film, and it's rather quick), where Juno experiences the labor pain. She doesn't make light of it in her acting, but shows emotional trauma, balance problems, and makes a real good show of her immense pain.<br />Luckily, even with different forms of betrayal here and there, Juno does get the help she's been in need of, stays with her friends, has the support of her family, and helps one woman's hopeful life of being a mother happen.<br />As a pro-lifer, I can honestly say this is one film that I've enjoyed over and over and will continue to do so, enjoying the quirky, outlandish (and at time outrageous) humor and deeply-rooted real-life issues played out every time.y-go-lucky on the \\"brighter\\" side of the fence either.<br />The couple that want to adopt Juno's unborn child (she doesn't want to know the kid's sex, wants it to be a surprise to herself as well as to the adoptive parents) start to have marriage issues when the \\"expecting\\" father suddenly isn't sure if he wants to be a parent.

0452289963|5.0|This, along with the Webinar he did with the help of Oprah Winfery is one of the best books to help you understand human nature.  It will give you a close look at what makes people tic, and give you insights into why you react in certain ways to input from others.  Once armed with this information, you will be far more likely to be a response-able communicator.  It also has a lot to say about who we are, and how God functions in our life, but the real jewels here are the insights into human nature.  This has the potential to change your life, if you can override your ego long enough to get into the book.
B001R0XNSI|3.0|Ok, so this pocket shark is a VERY formidable bludgeon type weapon. And I have actually used it as a decent marker on a number of occasions. I would have given this product 4 stars (I don't give anything 5 stars unless I cant live without it) but the pocket clip broke off fairly soon after I received it. I was a little rough with it but I expected better. so for the price a pretty good little weapon.
B004ZNAXX2|1.0|Ok, the box and trinket contents are on par with the other Immersion sets, but we have all been shafted by this release.  Yes, the CDs sound good (better than the original release), but for $120, we should have AT LEAST received hi-resolution Stereo 96KHz/24bit.  Instead, we got 7 discs of the same old stuff....no offense to James Guthrie intended.<br /><br />I humbly request a complete revolt on this product until it comes with a DVD-A or Blu-Ray w/hi-rez audio.  In the end, it's the SOUND I care about and not the silly box.<br /><br />Back it goes until a better sounding one is released.
1400052181|5.0|I found three themes in the book:  1) the development of the study of cells, written for the layman, 2) the astounding lack of basic biological knowledge in the family of the HeLa cell donor, and 3) the ethical dilemmas which developed along the 50-plus years of the story.  My book club loved it!  All of us voiced favorable comments on Rebecca Skloot's skill in bringing to the reader the science and the human story.

B0034JKZ86|4.0|The Princess and the Frog is a delightful story with a New Orleans background. The film, though a glimpse of New Orleans and its culture, could have played up more of the better parts of a wonderful city and culture. Too much was made of voodoo.<br /><br />However, the overall lessons in the story are many and good.  The \\"princess\\" is respectful to her parents who are hardworking people with limited opportunites.  She an her family are willing to work hard  toward their life goals.  Most of all, her love for her \\"frog prince\\" makes her willing, if necessary, to remain and live her life as a frog rather than to lose him and the love they have together.<br /><br />Overall, it seems to be is a good film for older children, perhaps 8 and up.  For younger ones, there are a few scenes that they might find very scary.<br />It is doutful that younger children would learn much from the New Orleans' background.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King is a masterful storyteller.  There's no denying that.  With 11/22/63, he takes us on a time travel adventure into the world of \\"what-if?\\"  You can feel the dedication he is to his characters and the story with each chapter that you read.  I bought this for my Kindle Fire and couldn't put it down.  I'm trying to get my wife to read it next.  I don't want to write more, because I know I'll give something away.  Just read it.

B005R5U5B2|5.0|I really do adore music in all of its forms - be it r&b, hip hop, classical, pop, jazz, spoken word set to rhythms and much more. I first was introduced to One Direction, through the video for \\"What Makes You Beautiful.\\" The five wonderful, charismatic and talented young men who sing and dance in beautiful harmony have a wonderful old school quality to their voices and style. Their lyrics are so positive and full of life. Yes, they are very full of life, too. I don't believe any of them are under the age of twenty - they have the world at their feet, and you can hear it in the guitar riffs, heartfelt declarations of love and wistfulness, and the production is so good!<br /><br />I won't insult them by comparing One Direction to any other bands, because, they truly are incomparable. My understanding is that they were on a talent show on British television, and went straight to the top. Play this great album, Up All Night, if you are up all night, want to get motivated to go out and do a workout or just about anything. I can honestly say that when this album is distributed for major release in the United States, people are going to say it was one of the best albums of 2012 - my prediction. Just purchase this, today, put on the headphones and rock out. My only complaint? Those thirteen tracks go by WAY too fast.
B005HSL626|5.0|always been a huge fan of fruit ninjas. the new update is pretty cool. it allows you to play online!

B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|Its a great game just like the original. I purchased the in game content and got all of the game for only ten dollars which is pretty awesome and cheap. my only request is that.they add a favorites category so out of the 100+ games I could easily access my favorites. other than that it is pretty much flawless.
B004H3WWU2|5.0|I purchased this bag because I have a 17in Wide screen Dell Latitude that would only fit in huge bags that I was tired of lugging around to the airport and office. This fit my laptop a little snug but it fits. This bag is a very slim bag and seems that it is called the squeeze because everything squeezes in. I am continuously impressed by the craftsmanship on this bag. It is super sturdy and comfortable. I loaded mine up and it feels like it can handle more. I never get the feeling that it is stretching or is going to tear. It has a ton of compartments/slots for you to put your stuff in. The only con is that with a 17 inch dell you can't put a whole lot into it because it already takes up a good amount of space. Which is okay and the reason why I got this bag. This bag is perfect if you just want to travel light and pack the essentials. Terralinq number is nice too!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app is hard to describe, as it is not a game. its halfway between a art exhibit and a science fair. each dot on the screen will act like a planetary body in a vacuum, and when you place a finger on the screen, you give their universe a point to gravitate to.  i have spent hours on this app, play it with relaxing music and you'll be asleep in no time. keep in mind, this is not an app where you set out to accomplish a goal. it is an app where you are given a plane with a set of rules, and allowed to explore for yourself. there is no right or wrong way to explore, and there is no guarantee on what you will experience, but this is the only app i have no intention of ever getting rid of because i have always found it enjoyable. a solid 5 stars.

B0050I2P32|5.0|I don't really write reviews but I'm a little ticked by the 2's and 3's this CD is getting. It's great music (a 5), and if you like shoegaze or nugaze or dream pop or post-rock or whatever, you'll enjoy it. This CD has sold well in the UK and I'm surprised it hasn't done better here.
630463949X|5.0|I actually had this concert on a VHS tape years ago that wore out.  LOL.  So I came across the CD and bought it...My favorite..Stevie Nicks of course!  I especially like SILVER SPRINGS, GOLD DUST WOMAN, AND RHIANNON.  But all the songs are high quality. Oh and LANDSLIDE.  HIGHEST RATING POSIBLE +++
0307959856|2.0|Most of the reviews of this novel express profound disappointment with its quality. I'm afraid I must add to that list.  This is a bad novel--not god-awful laughable bad, not amateurishly incompetent bad, just slow ponderously disappointingly bad in its failure to capture the charm of a Jane Austen novel or the captivating suspense of a P.D. James mystery.  It is readable,but just barely.  As others have said, it is slow, almost actionless, limited in interesting character development of Austen's creations,  devoid of the wit and magic of an Austen novel.  The deus ex machina climax seems a cliche from a Perry Mason tv drama.  It will disappoint both devoted readers of Jane Austen and P.D. James.
B001UE27X8|5.0|\\"The lonely night discloses<br />Just a passing breeze<br />Filled with memories<br />Of the golden smile that introduced me to<br />The days of wine and roses and you\\" ~ Johnny Mercer/Henry Mancini ~<br /><br />Will Friedwald, author of the essay on this two-CD-set compilation of the complete recordings of Tony Bennett and Bill Evans, ended his Liner Notes with a verse from a poem written by Ernest Dawson whom he noted as the British poet who inspired Johnny Mercer to write one of the most charming tracks from this set, \\"The Days of Wine And Roses.\\" And I quote:<br /><br />\\"They are not long<br />The days of wine and roses<br />Out of a misty dream<br />Our path emerges for a while<br />Then closes with a dream\\" ~ Edward Dawson ~<br /><br />He likened it to Tony Bennett's musical relationship with Bill Evans. As much as the legendary singer would love to record more albums with one of the greatest jazz pianists that he had collaborated with, it was not meant to be due to Bill Evans' premature death. Theirs was a short-lived musical partnership but it yielded some of the best recordings in the history of jazz.<br /><br />Will Friedwald further added that \\"the Bennett-Evans collaborations are an entirely different kettle of fish. Instead of the singer being accompanied by the pianist, with one in the spotlight and the other compromising a cast of one, both participants are equal partners.\\" That is so true. The complete recordings reveal the two artists in their own respective crafts complementing each other and not overshadowing one another. On these sessions, they were of equal billing and both gave their very best to create some of the jazz masterpieces of all-time.<br /><br />The great thing about this 2009 compilation from Concord Records is that it includes not only the two albums they recorded together, [[ASIN:B000J233MG Tony Bennett & Bill Evans Album]] (1975) and [[ASIN:B0000BWVCK Together Again]] (1976) but also a set of 20 (yes, twenty) alternate takes that were never published before and are absolute novelties to your ears. It was a surprise to learn that they did go as far as \\"alternate take 18\\" on one of the sessions. They were obviously aiming for utter perfection. But it was wonderful listening to all the alternate takes which are unheard of until this set of compilation CDs. As far as sonic is concerned, it is of high quality. All transfers were engineered by George Horn and Seth Presant from analog master tapes to digital at 24-bit resolution.<br /><br />According to Mr. Bennett, recording with Bill Evans was the most prestigious thing he ever did. To him, Bill Evans was a great guy, and they got along good. Bill Evans returned the compliment by declaring his own praises to the musicality and artistry of the living legend: \\"Tony Bennett is a jazz singer. And that's because a jazz singer has the ability to give a rather spontaneous performance that's flexible, with phrasing, and a sensitivity to beat, time, and nuance. Tony has all that in abundance. The greatest jazz players I know love Tony because he represents the best in musicality.\\"<br /><br />Tony Bennett's style of singing is as classy, well-expressed and elegant as Bill Evans' flair in piano playing. These recordings are works of art most especially my very own favorites starting with \\"Waltz For Debby,\\" which the pianist composed for his niece when she was three years of age, and the lyrics were penned by Gene Lees. Another highlight is \\"My Foolish Heart\\" rendered with its introductory verse. Equally memorable are the duo's interpretations of \\"We'll Be Together Again,\\" \\"You Don't Know What Love Is,\\" \\"But Beautiful\\" and \\"You Must Believe In Spring.\\" Will Friedwald believes that the two most definitive renditions of the last-mentioned song were recorded by Tony Bennett/Bill Evans and Freddy Cole in 1996, [[ASIN:B000IZBV6E Always]].<br /><br />This two-CD-set compilation comes with a 24-page-booklet with black-and-white photos of Tony Bennett and Bill Evans during the recording sessions and comprehensive Liner Notes written by Will Friedwald, author of various books on music and popular culture who also co-authored \\"The Good Life,\\" Tony Bennett's autobiography. This set surely deserves to be in any jazz enthusiast's music collection. With my heartfelt recommendation.s during the recording sessions and comprehensive Liner Notes written by Will Friedwald, author of various books on music and popular culture who also co-authored \\"The Good Life,\\" Tony Bennett's autobiography.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Getting a little frustrated that the games get so &quot;expensive&quot; as you go (first ten are free, then you earn points to buy more) but the games are simple and addictive.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|I got this 3d blu ray combo pack, and of course a copy for the iPad came with it. Come on people, Anything with Puss in Boots is a winner! Loved the movie, and yes its worth every penny!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Given I can't use the camera and audio features, I can still access my notes and write my journal. I may have to pay for the Premium to access offline when I don't have a WIFI around but I am using my Kindle Fire as a book reader.
B0000009RX|1.0|I don't get weird for the sake of weird, I don't get people who hate the Beatles for being too good at what they did, and apparently I don't get Zappa. This really does sound dated. Basically a hand full of musicians were still taken by the novelty of a modern (relatively for \\"68) recording studio. Fake phone conversations, meaningless jibber spoken into a mic (with lots of echo, that makes it so much more intriguing). Obviosly the cover and the eclectic collection of music (when there was a bit) was a spoof of the Beatles. Okay, so it's a spoof. What about it? It's kinda like watching a comedy spoofing another movie for not being funny and forgetting to be funny itself. Basically, if your in one of those hip circles who insists that Sgt. Peppers isn't a great album (which it is) simply because it is overrated (which it may be) than you might possibly find this album amusing.
B001FOPODS|5.0|I was hoping for something that would attract and keep the attention of a young audience and this far exceeded my expectations.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are fun and its really addicting. i really like all of the games.  i have played all of these games non - stop since the moment i got the app
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I would recommend the Marware MicroShell Folio cover for the Kindle Fire.  It's very light, but sturdy. It provides protection for my Kindle Fire, and fits in my purse so I can take it with me wherever I go.  Just exactly what I wanted and was hoping for when I ordered it.  I was not disappointed when I received the product because it served the purpose for which it was intended...to protect the Kindle Fire without it being cumbersome or heavy.  I like the fact that even with the cover on, my Kindle Fire is still compact and light, and safely protected at the same time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are pretty fun but not real challenging.  You have to click the?  right before the game to find out how to play.  My little cousins really liked it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love playing it anywhere.  Even great while waiting in line at the market. It's easy to go back to when interrupted.
0312641893|5.0|Modern retelling of Cinderella...we've seen it before, right?  But Cinder is no ordinary retelling: it's set in the future and has a sci-fi twist to it, making it different from all the other retellings out there.  Not to mention that it's set in China!<br /><br />I loved this book.  I thought I knew how it would end, but it surprised me and left me dying to read the sequel.  Cinder has everything you could ask for: a strong heroine who is forced to make decisions and choices that could change her life, a charming prince who is suddenly faced with responsibility for his country, and engaging minor characters.  Best of all, the characters are young people growing up and are perfect examples of self-sacrifice, honor, and bravery to do the right thing; yet still flawed enough that they are realistic.<br /><br />Marissa Meyer is a great writer!  I am really looking forward to where this series will go.  I loved the descriptions, the dialogue, the pacing, the plot - it was all woven together to make an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.  Cinder definitely stands out from all the other fairytale retellings.  Anyone who grew up loving the story of Cinderella will enjoy this original take on it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|love that it is always showing changes/updates. it has all the information that I like to have. I love it!
B004UHSB5A|2.0|For a paid app or even an add supported one this is of a very low level of quality. The controls are poor with a very rudimentary UI and the computer AI is just as poor and will rarely challenge you(rather beat only best you when you have a bad luck spree). The sound is also basic and since it only makes them when a play is made changing it is a pain, more of am issue with the android OS but still an oversight on he part of the app maker. For the actual game play it usually plays fine but it's not rare for it to bug up and cause the current set to score improperly.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|It is a game you can only play through once, but otherwise not bad. It has great length for this kinda game. maybe not worththe price unless your into this kinda puzzle game
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Overall The Walking Dead is an amazing comic series, and they have translated it masterfully to TV. I was skeptical coming in to this show having loved the comics, but was blown away to the detail and love for the source material Frank Darabont put into the first season. If they keep this up they may be making one of the greatest cable TV shows ever. The bonus features on this DVD give you an insight into the season that is something a fan of The Walking Dead will truly appreciate.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|well I love it. it's amazing. I love it. it's truly amazing. I love it. it's amazing. I love it
1400069289|5.0|I've only skimmed the Kindle edition of the book, but it's already changed my life.  Let me explain.<br /><br />As a friend of the author, I've been hearing about the ideas in the book for a while, and had a chance to read and comment on a few small sections of it.  I hadn't seen the whole story until it showed up on my Kindle this morning, but I'd heard enough to start playing around with my own habits.<br /><br />I realized my habits needed serious attention when I became a parent two years ago.  Suddenly I had a lot less time *and* a lot more reasons to want to keep my job.  As an academic, that job gives me a lot of flexibility but also demands a lot of output (as they say, publish or perish).<br /><br />Like many others, I've discovered that Starbucks is a good place to write.  But it's expensive (in dollars and calories), and it's only effective for a few hours at a time (especially now that plugs are harder to find).  What I really needed was to spend more time at my desk, ideally in the mornings so I could get home for dinner earlier and more often.  But I've never been a morning person, and sharing a bed with a toddler too frequently hasn't helped that at all.<br /><br />Long story short: the ideas in this book helped me experiment with alternative routines that harnessed the same cues and rewards but enabled me to fundamentally change the way I organize my time.  I now routinely get out of bed before 6 am (thanks to my son, I don't need an alarm clock anymore) and sit down at my desk by 7:30 feeling awake and focused.<br /><br />Unfortunately my coffee habit has gotten worse -- I now pick up a super-sweet, super-strong one on the way to the office (albeit at less than a quarter of the price of my old iced mocha).  But one of the key messages of the book is that habit change is an ongoing project filled with intermediate steps and tradeoffs.<br /><br />BTW, Duhigg also has a lot to say about organizational habits and even the habits of societies.  I recommend these parts of the book to managers and policy makers interested in an accessible and insightful take on the large and growing body of recent research in this area.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Used to not work now fixed amazing game! Runs so well on my Samsung galaxy nexus!!! Thanks for the fix Hexage!
B0049OSQ18|5.0|This is an excellent example of setting aside expectations, past performance, and genre.  The King is Dead contains 40 minutes of flat-out, beautiful, delicately-crafted music.  Is it a great Decemberists album?  A transcendent piece of Americana or alt-country-folk music?  I don't care.  I just keep playing the thing and singing along.  You might say of \\"June Hymn\\" that it's just another Colin Meloy song with a familiar structure, pointless wordplay, and predictable harmonic content, but you'd do that at the expense of appreciating the beautiful phrasing and delicate interplay between him and Gillian Welch.  There's so much more here than boom-chucka simple country writing in every song.  Forget they're from Portland--or anywhere at all--slap on the headphones, relax, and just listen.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I'm not even sure how to describe this book. I am sorry it took me so long to read it, and I wish Larsson were still alive to finish his series.<br /><br />Larsson writes in an unemotional voice that somehow makes the reader...emotional. I was angry at the injustice of the actions of the bad guy, thrilled when Solander took charge and took over and stole back her independence. I'm curious to learn more about her life, and I look forward to finding out if anything happens in her love life. Anything REAL.<br /><br />I'm not going to give a summary because I think there are enough of those out there. I am going to say that I literally sat all weekend reading this book. I couldn't put it down. I've never read anything like it at all, and I'm a couple hundred pages into the next book.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, I encourage you to do so. According to a little bit of research I've done, Larsson's stories are based on truth. If that's the case, his books give an amazing and sad glimpse into the Swedish world, a Swedish world Larsson did a lot to fix.<br /><br />He was an amazing man and women's advocate, and the world is a sadder place without him.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I spent hours looking for some type of case or protection for my iPhone 4S. I've had cases that you had to undo to get the phone out in the past that seemed like too much trouble.  By the time you got the phone out and unlocked it, the phone stopped ringing.  There are various phone cases and covers out there with wild designs, some that I even liked, but some just looked a little too goofy for when I'm in a business environment. I finally selected this case because I like the look of my white iPhone and didn't really want to cover it up.  I liked that this case is see-through but still has a little circular design on the back to give it a little extra style.<br /><br />It was easy enough to install on the phone with a little pulling and stretching, just enough that you know it won't slip off on it's own.  The screen protector had one corner that wouldn't stay down, so I discarded it and purchased another instead. (It could have been my applying it that was at fault since I'm not always as careful and patient as I should be.)  I like that I can now throw my iPhone in my purse without having to put it in a case and it is protected from scratches.  This case wouldn't provide any protection if you were to drop the phone, because there's no cushioning, but for wear and tear and scratches, it works very well.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|First of all, a great horror movie. But the extras....OMG! The bonus features alone would be worth the price. There is footage of building Chucky, rehearsal footage, even what the actors look like today! It is so cool to see people operating the Chucky controls and seeing all the robotics that went into making the various Chuckies. There is nothing like footage from the 1980's, lol. There are some scenes with Chucky commentary, there is even a full commentary track by Andy and the woman who played his mother! Unfortunately, they did their commentaries separately so you don't really get to hear them interact with each other. We even see Chucky-concept drawings and the different dolls that were needed for different actions. They even have film of the 2007 reunion and some of the cast answering questions. Another neat bonus feature is about the making of this movie, back from the 1980's. And wow, is Don Mancini cute in the current bonus features! Even though this is a horror movie, there was a romance that blossomed on set. This DVD is an amazing tribute to a still scary movie.

030788743X|4.0|I enjoyed Ready Player One. I'm a avid gamer, so I appreciated many of the references. The book was clearly a labor of love. Good quick read.
0142002038|4.0|First let me say that a friend and business partner gushed about growing up reading Ian Fleming and being a life-long fan of his work. Naturally I had to take a gander. Having watched the movie version of Dr. No, which spawned a long-running and highly successful multi-leading-man series, I figured I couldn't go wrong dipping into the very book that got Hollywood to put its machinery behind the mega-earning franchise. Let me also say that the setting, that being Jamaica and its island neighbors, is not unlike the tropical, Third World setting in which I grew up, so I could readily identify with the narrative blocks that lovingly presents a dreamy, paradise landscape dripping with beauty and littered with colorful natives. The language too was a throwback to my past, as Fleming delivered authentic dialogue in the Cayman, Quarrel, whose island dialect is spot on.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple, and moves at a decent pace after things are set in motion during a routine meeting that takes place in M's office. During this meeting, Bond is presented with his signature Walther PPK (suggested to Fleming by author and gun collector Geoffrey Boothroyd, who is the inspiration for Major Boothroyd in this book), and we get a lot of gun speak that showcases Fleming's acquired knowledge of the subject. While the meeting progresses, Fleming makes several references to the gloomy weather outside--it's raining cats and dogs and M's eyes are drawn to the window now and again. This is the perfect juxtaposition for the brilliant weather we get once on mission, and its done purposefully to segment the book.<br /><br />Dr. No eventually comes into the conversation--in an interesting way at that--as does the previous agent that was assigned to him in Jamaica, whom M believes has run off with his secretary. Bond, fresh from recovering from deadly wounds after a nasty experience during the previous adventure, is thrown this seemingly meager assignment as a slap on the wrist by M, but of course this is a Bond book, and there are no such things as meager assignments, as we will soon learn.<br /><br />When Bond lands in Jamaica, the fun really starts. We meet Quarrel, a tough, seasoned islander with access into the lower rungs of society, and a man who proves to be an invaluable ally to Bond. But Quarrel is leery of venturing too close to Dr. No's island for fear of never returning. The adventure that ensues is very enjoyable and well composed, with language that lifts this book from the level of mere spy thriller to something that is nearly literary. The book is loaded with opulence and decadence, but there is also lot of mention about guanayes, guano, and guanera. In fact, when you come away from this book you'll probably be an expert on the subject.<br /><br />Among my favorite sections of the book is the action that happens below ground, in Dr. No's lair. Bond's interaction with Honey in the mink-lined prison is well played, and the encounter with Dr. No himself that begins in the library that looks out at the ocean really draws the reader deeper into an already thrilling story.<br /><br />That said, the pulse-pounding climax alone is worth the price of the book! Hard not to read the last 40 - 50 pages in one sitting.ut of course this is a Bond book, and there are no such things as meager assignments, as we will soon learn.<br /><br />When Bond lands in Jamaica, the fun really starts.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This book took me in and kept me there until I had finished the whole thing. Lucky there is a sequel as it didn't end. I feel like I left the movie for a bathroom break and came back and it was over with everyone shaking their heads.<br />I enjoyed it, and didn't feel bogged down in detail like I normally do.  The novel read swiftly for that many pages, and I must admit even though I don't like books with witches etc. I changed my mind.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game for me and my son. great way to kill time at the drs office. will keep this one handy.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I saw the show on a special presentation at movie theaters in US on late February 2012 and all I can say is: WOW!<br />I didn't see this coming.<br /><br />The show was cancelled in London just months after its opening and they filmed the Australian production for DVD, so I expected to see another Webber's flop. Does anyone remember Woman in White?<br /><br />But Love Never Dies is an amazing show, with incredible singers, beautiful songs and set.<br />Way deeper and more emotional than Phantom.<br /><br />A beautiful experience that you don't want to miss!
B004KZOWEG|4.0|I enjoyed reading this account of Leopold's colony in the Congo. It is amazing that history books cant be edited to tell the truths later agreed upon. Nothing changes, progress is a story told to justify itself. Discovering a lie is both depressing and enlightening.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|For a first time novelist, this book was everything a reader hopes for.  Captivating storyline, characters you care about and a mystery to keep you turning the pages even when you're tired!  I loved this book.  I literally bought 10 copies and gave it to all of my \\"reader\\" friends, because the way the story was told, how it unfolds, and how right up until the VERY end you are still given details -- it was just ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!  Can't wait to see what her next book will be like!
B005URRCUY|3.0|Big fan of the Black Keys. Enjoyed much of \\"Brothers.\\" El Camino deserves the harsh criticism it's getting. There are some good tracks, but most play it too safe and lack the bursting energy or heartfelt passion of previous Keys' efforts. Much of it is a forgettable experience. I don't blame the Keys for trying out new sounds. Bands have to evolve. But let's hope the next effort recaptures that energy, whatever form it's in.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Really very helpful book for any entrepreneur looking for a better understanding of business models and lean ones at that, highly recommended!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|once I started playing this game I couldn't, put it down. a real brain teaser. love it. it ranks right up there with angry birds.
B003A03RRU|5.0|this one of the best book i have ever read. it has every sherlock holmes book ever written it is so awesome.
B005RJI67I|5.0|I absolutely love all things harry potter. I ordered this little set to go with my growing collection of Lego Harry Potter Minifigures. I'm expecting a Professor Snape Minifigure that I plan on pairing up with this mini potions lab. It's so stinkin cute.<br />These mini sets are real great for my 4 year old also. They really help teach him to follow simple written instructions and are great for exercising fine motor skills.<br />All in all, this set is too cute to pass up for the price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. I have it for my kindle and its great. the only thing is that it keeps crashing. once they fix it the,app will be great. so much fun..
B0078JOAOI|5.0|If you want to watch an amazing show about a group of people surviving a zombie apocalypse this is it!!!! I hear a lot of people complaining about how they are still on this farm but come on the show is about human survival. If you're expecting a bunch of people riding around on tanks, huge action sequences, trying to find the ultimate cure, taking on corporations and fighting giant bio weapons watch stupid Resident Evil. The Walking Dead is amazing keep it up!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it it is one of the best games I have played. I love the challenge of unlocking the games.
0439023513|4.0|I really liked reading the three books. They were great and easy to read. I have never read books as fast as I did with these three books. I could not put them down. I always wanted to know what was going to happen to Katness and Peeta next. The only the thing I think that could have been better was the ending. I felt it ended to quickly. It was like Suzanne just got tired of writing and closed the end to fast. It was anti climatic. To quick and clean of an ending. Other wise I loved the books. Would love to see more about Katness and her Children.
1568363931|5.0|I ordered this book to make my husband bento lunches and he loves them. They are all so easy, I didnt want to read a novel before I made a dish. It explains bento box sizes and recipes are quick and easy. There website Justbento.com has alot of ideas and answers for bento users.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Ash practices what he writes. His book started as an idea, and he was iterating until the final product was what the market needed. He was kind enough to let me participate in the early previews and revisions, so I saw how he applied the Lean concepts step by step.<br /><br />The book itself is a great resource for anyone trying to understand the startup world, and in particular for those compelled to learn about Lean methodologies.<br /><br />You will find a great framework, cases, examples and step by step guidance on the most important topics.<br /><br />Without any doubt this book is a \\"must read\\" for every entrepreneur. I will also use it as reading material for my teaching in the University of San Martin - Argentina.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Running Lean.  I've read many books on Lean Startup and Customer Development but Running Lean stands out as a highly practical, methodological and easy to read account of the topic.  I would especially recommend to developers as well as CEOs.<br /><br />Even though we aren't strictly an innovation startup, we are applying the techniques to our internet business.  The result has been greater understanding of our business by the whole team, identification of the most important hypotheses to test and a clearer roadmap to success.  We have a Lean Canvas on our wall and take pride in explaining the ideas to office visitors.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this as a must-read for developers, marketers, CEOs, or anyone interested in or involved in starting a new business.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Warning. This review contains spoilers. I must say that The Death Cure was a bit of a disappointment after the tremendous buildup Dashner created in The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials. In the first two books, Dashner created a complex, suspenseful, and mysterious number of possible realities; however, in The Death Cure, he fails to capitalize on the potentials of these possible realities. Let me give you two examples. The Right Arm, an underground anti-WICKED group, enlists Thomas to go back to WICKED, supposedly to volunteer to finish the tests, but actually to plant a device in WICKED headquarters that will disable WICKED's weapons.  My complaint? It worked. Even though Thomas had led an armed escape from WICKED, he isn't searched or scanned when he returns. Not only that, but Thomas successfully plants the device in the restroom. That was a real disappointment. WICKED has extremely sufficient high-tech spying gadgets all over the place, but not in the restroom? Second example. Teresa appears very sparingly in this book, and dies pushing Thomas out of the way of falling concrete, which falls on her instead. She's not even allowed any coherent last words. Thomas grieves for her, but just a little bit. The book ends with him happily kissing Brenda. After the tremendous sympathy that Dashner creates in the reader for Teresa in The Maze Runner and a number of questions he raises around her in The Scorch Trials, I am disappointed in Dashner's negligent treatment of her in The Death Cure.  Yet, despite being a bit disappointed in some aspects of The Death Cure,  I still enjoyed it. If you've read the first two books, I recommend The Death Cure.  If you haven't read the first two books, you might find The Death Cure only marginally satisfying. I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game to pass the time. It is definitely worth it. The controls are smooth and easy. Why aren't you downloading it already??
B003EYVXT6|2.0|Perverted piece of junk. Same old man creates super intelligent creature.  Usually, the creature will start out obedient, innocent, afraid of the unknown, and so on.  Now they are super intelligent, no longer obedient, unafraid, and so on.  Of course scientist are always curious of what if pushed to the limit, can they accomplish with hopes of outstanding results.  Man of course, is never satisfied with leaving somethings alone to the undiscovered.<br /><br />Of course, its evident what will be the outcome most likely in this film. I usually like Adrien Brody in some of his movies, but this film left me a little distressed with him.  Attracted to a creature that resembled a child with child like curious behaviors, was perverted.  Even his character struggled with his feelings toward her, but eventually gave in. He and his fellow female actor did not have much of a connection to me.  This picture left me disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i use this all the  time on my phone. i don't  even USE my other bible anymore. it's  always there and really easy to navigate!!! best app I EVER got

B004RE29WW|2.0|I can recall once seeing a nice little family film titled 'Anne of Green Gables'available at Amazon.HOLD IT ! what has AOGG got to do with Aliens3 you may well ask,have patience.AOGG was a great family film and so was it's sequel. BUT IT WENT ON AND ON AND ON until it became so orrible it just died because the studio got GREEDY. The same could be said of 'Alien3' the first 2 excellent but then comes 'Alien3'. The filthy language is enough to make even the devil blush even with the excuse of being realistic.The EGG at the begining is never explained and killing off the other 2 plus poor Bishop left Ripley at the start in an isolated state. One huge flaw,and there are many,is in the 'Assembled Version' Ripley dicoveres she has a queen alien in her by having a scan carried out in the wrecked pod. Why did'nt she carry out the same procedure for little Nute instead of us being put through the emotional procedure of cutting the poor kid open.I would not plug this film.Please stop at James Camerons Masterpiece 'Aliens'.<br /><br />  Thomas Knight,<br />  Wintergarden Film(Aust)
0131103628|3.0|This book is a classic but it's made for people who already know how to program and are thinking of learning C. I read through it once and have referred to it a few times, but I have found other books to be far more informative. The only sections I particularly like in this book are the ones discussing syntax and the library function listings.
B000002UZ4|5.0|It is totally rare to find an album with 18 cuts and that I truly say \\"there isn't one I don't like.\\"<br /><br />This is the second copy I've purchased (I feel I need a back-up just in case!!)  I purchased the first copy in Scotland in 2009 and it cost me 15pounds!!  Totally smashing!!
B003ZDZ1WG|2.0|Everything was great as far as shipping and the product being new and all that.  That is why it got an extra star.  Now for the review of the album, which in my opion gets one star: This is a WARNING to those who are about to buy this album, unless you are a 13 year old girl or a very needy woman that has to depend on a man to make her feel good than you may not like these songs.  I am a guy and am disturbed by the message this band is sending to women, if that tells you anything. I am very upset by this purchase and had bought it hearing only one song off the radio.  My mistake,I won't doing that again.
B004SRNH10|5.0|My tablet would not connect to my laptop.  I installed this and now i have full access to my tablet's internal directories on my laptop.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use the audio version a lot and my 6 yr old always ask if we are going to listen to the Bible or tell me to turn it up so she can hear it too
B002U3CCBK|4.0|Paul Torday is a great writer of unlikely plots. This book is probably his best so far. I read him when I want something different.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|Best offline maps! Amazing level of detail, works really fast. It downloads maps to my Kindle Fire and allows to use them later without Internet access. Helped me a lot during my trip to Europe. Great work!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|Nice app; pretty cool to &quot;have another person&quot; keep you on task.  I sometimes lose focus so this app is very good for me.  Also like the randomize feature so routine will be varied.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome, I love that I have access to all versions. excellent App. If you are looking for a bible app look no further you have found it.
B006QVRVJK|3.0|Two Couples get together to discuss a fight between their two kids. They spend the entire day arguing with each other, with the discussion beginning friendly enough, then evolving into outright verbal warfare. This film features four top-notch actors, each bringing their own unique gifts to their respective roles. The movie is short and features a few laughs, with the characters trying to maintain a modicum of civility while hurling verbal zingers at one another. This is a solid, if unspectacular film that is worth seeing.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie should have won best picture. No kidding. I also bought the soundtrack and the audio CD of Commentary! The Musical. (Don't miss the commentary, btw. It's arguably even funnier than the actual movie.)
B006RED4GA|3.0|An old hotel is closing and it may be haunted. The final two staffers are overseeing the departing guests and trying to make contact with the spirits that may be inhabiting the place. The film has its instants of creepiness, but it often relies on the old horror film gimmick of cheap frights, and doesn't provide enough truly scary moments. Moreover, I found the finale unsatisfying, not providing enough of an explanation for what I had just seen. The makings of a good horror movie are present; I just don't think the execution is adequate. This is another low-budget horror effort from Ti West, and this time he disappoints.
B0051HNMTI|4.0|it helps me keep track of my weight,lush ups/situps it halos lot,lot,andlottsssss I just love it so very much ive tried so many this helps alot
B005LAIGLE|4.0|A former drug runner gone straight gets back in the game in order to bail out his screw-up brother-in-law. He is known as one of the best, and must try to outsmart authorities, while also worrying about the safety of his wife and children. This is a solid action-adventure film that will appeal primarily to a male audience, with its tough-guy sequences and non-stop action, but is not merely a mindless, violent male action fantasy. It has a heady plot, and there is a surprise twist at the end. Contraband is a straightforward action film that most moviegoers should enjoy.
B006UG90RM|5.0|The whole premise is absurd. Van Halen has a new album out in 2012.  A new album featuring David Lee Roth on vocals.  Somehow, since reuniting several years ago, the brothers and Dave haven't imploded once again.  Absurd.<br />Now the album has been out for weeks and I still find myself in disbelief. There is no way it should sound this good.  No way you make an album after almost THIRTY (30!) years that sounds so close in spirit to your original works.  People are slamming the \\"reworked tracks\\" from the olden days.  I would ask those civilians, \\"what is in your personal back catalogue that rocks so &$&!$!$* hard?\\"  Even in the old days, the group was always drawing from old ideas, reworking them, frankensteining bits and pieces into songs for each release.  The classic six pack of VH albums is full of recycled bits turned into gold.  It's science folks...it's alchemy.<br />I will never know why two incredibly talented brothers can only be inspired to true greatness by a 'court jester' that can hardly sing...but that is the way it is.  Now proven.<br />I think David Lee Roth is one awesome dude.  Read his book, \\"Crazy from the Heat\\". Very off the cuff and endlessly inspiring.  I also think his vocal style is unique and easily picked apart.  However, you cannot deny his charisma and presence, on this or any planet.  He brings the best out of everyone around him.  When those around him are some of the most talented musicians of a generation...wow.<br />There are so many highlights I couldn't believe it- encompassing all the metal, pop, classic rock, and blues directions of the six original albums.  I never ceased to be excited by the recordings on first listen and it continues now after hearing them dozens of times.  The only song I am not crazy about in one way or another is \\"Bullethead\\", which contains the albums' title lyric.  Nothing is wrong with the song.  In fact it is far better than anything you will find on any currently popular rock band's setlist.  The problem is, compared to the creativitity and musicianship of the other twelve tracks here, it lacks just a little something and gets left in the dust.<br />Many people have expressed negative views on lead single \\"Tattoo\\" which I can understand but disagree with.  I feel this track is a Roth song with VH backing music, which to me works on a certain level, but makes it stand apart from classic VH material.  I could start dissecting the other 11 tracks ones by one... but they are all fantastic.  Listen several times yourself and develop your own opinion why.<br />The riffs, the solos, the lyrics all add something.  The drum and bass (and backing vocals-who knew so many people were obsessed with Michael Anthony screeching? Wolfgang is fine) sound inspired and funky.  Far better album than I dared to hope for.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A boy raises a horse that turns out to be quite a spectacular creature. The horse is sold off during WWI and embarks on a journey through several owners, making an impact on everyone who encounters him. The question in everyone's mind is \\"will the horse be reunited with his original owner?\\" I will let the viewer discover the answer to that burning question while seeing the movie. As for the film itself, it is classic Spielberg; a heartwarming storyline, visually spectacular, and a well-told tale. The Schmaltz is turned on a bit here, but the movie's strengths, particularly the realistic war scenes, far outweigh its weaknesses. This is another fine effort from Hollywood's greatest director.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I had another Office app that came with my tablet, but stumbled across this one that is Free. Kingsoft Office is \\"the cat's meow\\"! VERY good UI, in some ways easier to use than Microsoft Office. I expect MS to, ahem, appropriate some of it's features into their Office apps (if they're smart). Check it out !
B0059XTUVI|4.0|The story of Margaret Thatcher, the first woman elected Prime Minister of England. The movie begins with her later years suffering from Alzheimer's and flashes back to her early days as a young woman and her time in office. The movie only provides a snapshot of who she is, and perhaps could have focused less on her current condition, and given more weight to her rise from an eager young woman to the leadership of Great Britain. The primary reason to see this one is for one of the great performance by Meryl Streep. The iconic actress is at her finest, and successfully delves into the role, transforming herself into \\"The Iron Lady.\\" If you enjoy great acting, this is a good one to see.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|This app would not function properly on my Ainol Novo 7 tablet with Android 4.01 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I know the ranking of this particular company's software would have made it nice to have been able to install. Time will get them there.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|A group of men see their plane go down in an extremely cold climate. The few that survive find themselves dealing with not only the extreme cold, but a pack of hungry wolves. One of the men assumes a leadership role because of his knowledge of the wolves. This is an intense and exciting movie that avoids being a standard action film where characters you don't care about are killed one-by-one. The brutality of the wolves is evident and the efforts of the men to survive are amazing. You will find yourself invested in their determination and saddened when the effort is for naught. This is a good one.
B006T5FDLG|1.0|4 1/2 stars for ride, master, ajfa and 4 and 5 stars for this are u kidding me, parts are ok but come on, i know music stinks now but some of u are reaching as is metallica!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|An infamous CIA agent who has been on the run for years suddenly appears and is overseen by a young agent trying to make a name for himself. Why did he disappear and why did he suddenly show up? These questions are answered in the midst of some of the most riveting action sequences in recent years. Fine acting and an intriguing story highlight one of the most solid action films we've seen. The excitement doesn't let up throughout, and the question of who are the \\"good guys\\" and who are the \\"bad guys\\" is ever-present. This one is very well-done.
0307593312|3.0|Daniel Kahneman says that there are two kinds of happiness: happiness in your life, and happiness about your life. If so, reading Murakami is to experience of the first kind of happiness but not the second. I enjoyed almost all of the 900 plus pages of 1Q84 as I read them, but in retrospect, I'd have a hard time saying that 1Q84 was a novel worth reading. Murakami gives me enjoyment in the moment of reading by breaking with the modern tradition of fragmented, obscure, opaque, or unreliable narrators to create protagonists who straightforwardly describe the interior workings of their minds. As when Tengo, Murakami's hero, thinks about the disadvantages of having sex with a younger woman:<br /><br />\\"All the responsibilities fell on his shoulders. He felt like the captain of a small boat on a stormy sea, having to take the rudder, inspect the setting of the sails, keep in mind the barometric pressure and the wind direction, and modulate his own behavior so as to boost the crew's trust in him. The slightest mistake or accident could lead to tragedy. This felt less like sex than the discharging of a duty.\\"<br /><br />How amusing and instructive to discover these feelings in a man! For me, one of the main purposes of a novel is to provide autobiographical narratives that are alternatives to the default stories our culture provides, and Murakami fulfills this requirement splendidly. The problems I have with 1Q84 come in the aftermath of reading, during the period when the stories and images that make up a novel either form new clusters of associations in my memory, or dissolve into the vast clutter of stuff I've read and forgotten. I'm not sure I will completely forget 1Q84, but I'm pretty sure I'll want to, because what I remember best is the novel's weakest part, the implausible romance at its center.<br /><br />Lorin Stein, in his \\"Ask The Paris Review\\" column, called 2666 \\"Bolano's second-most Murakamian novel\\". I'd call 1Q84 Murakami's attempt to outdo 2666. In addition to the obvious similarity of their titles, both novels were at some point multiple novels and are much longer than they need to be; both are composed in an old tradition of stories nested inside stories; both swim in the rising tide of surrealism that seems to have flooded the seriously literary world; both are anchored to reality with an obsessive focus on life's mundane routines of food, sex, and murder.<br /><br />Murakami is a far happier author than Bolano, but also a far less interesting one. Perhaps Kahneman also has something to say about this, in his description of the fast intuitive \\"system one\\" mind that's turned on when we're happy, and whose workings make us feel good, and the slow ponderous logical \\"system two\\" mind that works when we're uncomfortable, and makes us tired. Or I could say that reading 1Q84 is like eating an enormous souffle, where 2666 is more like a week's worth of rice, veggies, tofu, and lentils.<br /><br />I was especially saddened to see Murakami retreat from NORWEGIAN WOOD'S endorsement of its hero's actual relationship with the delightfully real Midori over his idealized fantasy relationship with the ethereal and beautiful Naoko. 1Q84 relies on obsessive romantic fantasy to make sense out of a chaotic ever-shifting world, and that's not enough of an idea to provide coherence for a long novel, much less a life.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|Another in a line of films portrayed as actual footage later found. Filmed documentary style, the movie tells the story of three high school boys who encounter some sort of alien ship or something, and then acquire superhuman powers of telekinesis. Predictably, things spiral out of control for the three. This is a realistic, and quite good film about a young man with problems who is unable to control the powers he discovers. His two friends try to help, but they are unable to control him. This one was a pleasant surprise and is the best movie of its kind since Paranormal Activity.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Clear, to the point and practical, it is full of gold and no BS. The structure of the book and its real life examples make it really easy to implement in no time. If you want to DO this is your book, and you will also learn something along the way, a lot more than with other books that talk a lot of theory and are more oriented to the corporate boardroom. Running Lean is the best book out there for entrepreneurs that want to launch their startups using customer development and lean startup.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading it and using it to build a new project.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|A group of Navy Seals are on a mission to stop an Islamic radical who is working with a drug smuggler to commit terrorist acts. What makes this movie unique is that the Navy Seals are the real deal, not stuntmen and professional actors. Their lack of training in regards to acting is apparent, but that does not detract from the excitement throughout as they engage in realistic combat missions against the bad guys. The film successfully combines the action of the Seals with actors portraying other characters to make a very exciting combat action movie that will stir your patriotic senses.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok but I hate how you have to unlock all of the games. some of the games are not passable it is sssooooo frustrating
B005LAIGSM|4.0|Following a car accident, a woman has no memory of the time she has spent with her husband, or of even meeting him. He tries to resume their life together, and she struggles to live with a man that she does not know. Strong lead chemistry highlights this solid romantic-comedy, with the couple playing well off each other and clearly enjoying their time rekindling their romance. There are many moments of difficulty, with the lady trying to re-enter a life that she doesn't remember, and a former boyfriend entering the picture. Well-scripted and well-acted, this is a very good date night movie, or one you may like seeing solo.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Skill levels from beginner all the way to I Double Dare You. Beautiful graphics, smooth play. All in all, highly addictive.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|A young man travels to a small town set in the 1890's, where young children have been dying. He begins seeing images of a deceased woman and looks for a connection with the deaths. The movie contains certain predictable elements of the horror genre, like faces in the window, doors slamming, creepy music, and a rocking chair with no one in it. The late 1800's setting is effective, but this attempt at a combination of a horror film and a murder mystery falls a bit flat as the film is just not very frightening and the investigation into the deaths is only mildly interesting.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|My wife selected this movie from Netflix. At first, I was fearful of another cheesy love story.  After watching this film, I felt that each character had their own love story.  Often times in film, the user only sees the early stages of love that is perfect in new.  This film touches on that as well as the struggles that come with marriage.  It had a perfect balance of comedy an mushy stuff.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good laugh with their significant other.  The viewer walks away in appreciation of the amount of sacrifice and work it takes to keep a marriage alive.
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|The story of a young boy whose father died on 9/11. The child finds a mysterious key in his dad's belongings and is determined to find out what the key is for. The film combines his search for the lock with depictions of the boy's difficulty in dealing with the loss of his father. The boy is rather difficult for adults to deal with, and also difficult for the audience to watch. His acting-out is frustrating at times, and makes him more annoying than likeable. I found the movie a bit overlong, although the final minutes of the film are more rewarding than the middle. I would say that this film has a good story to tell, but I am not so sure this one tells it.
0062060562|5.0|This was a great read. At first, I was wary of the book's concept (a woman who has amnesia and wakes up every day unable to remember the past twenty or so years of her life). I had a feeling that it might be repetitive for readers, since she has to go through the same realizations every day. I was pleasantly surprised! I highly recommended this book, and feel it is important to add that I finished the whole book in one night. It's a real page turner. You will be so excited at the end when the plot twist reveals itself; I found it completely unexpected.<br />Make sure you have an hour or so ahead of you before you start this book; the mystery sucks you in and you wont be able to put it down!
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|A young woman who works for private company that is hired by the government to do things they shouldn't be doing finds herself double-crossed by people she trusted. She sets out to not only survive, but find out who betrayed her and get back at them. This may sound like standard action-revenge fare, but it is more than that. This is a smart, well-paced action thriller, containing well-choreographed fight scenes, and a cast of talented actors. The lead actress in this film is an MMA fighter and her skills are on display here. She is attractive, athletic, and strikes just the right combination of leading lady and kick-a** fighter. Haywire gets the 2012 movie season off to a rousing start.
1595826971|4.0|The book in itself is wonderful and awesome. Buy it, it's worth it, it is full of details and all the artworks are amazing.<br />But, mine wasn't in perfect condition. I don't blame the shop, since the book was correctly packaged, I think it's te transport company who screwed it up.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I got PvZ a while ago on my droid. Upgraded to the Galaxy Nexus when it came out. This was unplayable for the longest time, until the update in early February. Then it froze every 2-3 levels, but it was playable. With the update at the end of February, it freezes before I can even start a level. I enjoy the game... when I can actually play it. Please stabilize the game for ICS.
1455510319|5.0|Great Michael Connelly / Michael Haller book, for those who know Connelly's two main characters, the half-brothers Bosh and Haller. There is a surprise career decision Mickey makes at the end of the book, that would significantly change the POV of his character should he follow up on it in the next books. Surprise turns and twists, resolutions on all levels. If I have to rate it in Connelly's books for Haller, it will be #1.
0812992792|5.0|It is so painful to read this book - to imagine it might be true - Barbaric, Monstrous, Incredible - that I must stop every so often - get away from it, stop touching it, letting it into my mind, my imagination, my heart. Even though I must have read a thousand books in my lifetime, I have never experienced this before. It is excruciating - but I must continue, must follow it to its ending. I'm almost there...  How I hope for a good ending ... How I expect and dread the ending .....
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book is a very useful companion for any entrepreneur, be you a business owner or not, no matter what stage your company or idea is at. Even better, it isn't just theoretical in nature but practical in purpose too. It contains some very useful information on various approaches that actually work, it's well structured so that you can easily start adapting it to your business needs (retrospectively or not) and has some very useful and insightful commentary and case studies.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have finally reached the 5th and hopefully last book of this series. Don't get me wrong, I loved the first three books, but it should have ended there. The characters you want to follow disappeared for ages in Book 4, and new characters keep being introduced. It's exhausting. These novels would have been so much better if they had been tightened up.
B0052U59F4|5.0|i love this book i could not sleep untill i finished it! best book i have read thank you !!!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Love this movie. It was worth waiting for. Ends at the right spot to get you ready for part 2.
0545265355|5.0|I loved, loved, loved these books.  Which I actually found VERY surprising, since I'm not usually the science fiction, post-apocalypse type of girl.  I found the character and plot development masterful and absolutely had trouble putting any of them down from start to finish.  It was like going on a big roller-coaster ride so buckle your seat belt!!<br /><br />The only criticisms I have is related to the target audience (that is, for young adults).  I truly think the books might be too violent for some young adults.  I think as a parent if you do allow your children to read these books then you should read them first and make that judgement call for yourself.  If you did decide to let them read the books, then you could have discussions with them.  And, on the other hand, for adults the romance scenes could DEFINITELY be expanded.  But, that being said, I understand that the author was making a statement about teaching kids the truth of war.  I don't have teenage children but if I did I don't think I would want them to read the books because of the graphic violence. The romance is meant to be a side note to just get you emotionally involved with the story and it's development is sweet and pure.<br /><br />I NEVER usually reread books but admit I have almost finished rereading the first book in the series.  I thought it was really just that good and I am really looking forward to seeing the movie when it comes out in March.  Suzanne Collins is a genius and my new favorite author!!  I love the flow of the stories and how they are linked together from beginning to end with characters who are so believable and strong.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and the play action is top shelf.  What a great source if entertainment for anyone.  I will tell my fellow Kindle Fire friend to be sure to add this one to your favorites.
B005G0ETV0|5.0|CD1 featuring Rubenstein's first 1928 recordings in crystal clear reproduction sets the tone for the rest of this collection where the term \\"impressive\\" falls far short of reality. Quite frankly, you'd swear he was playing in the same room.<br />Hey, all you Amazon sellers with the Horowitz, Heifitz, and Gould original label sets at unbeliveably and blatantly greedy prices, get the message!! The value of legendary music is in its accessibility, definitely not your presumptive price
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I read the pdf version of Running Lean and I found it useful and practical in analysing my startup ideas. Ash, gave real life examples based on his previous experience, which deals with web based consumer startup.<br /><br />There is a tool called Lean Canvas [...] which helps in documenting your business model. It is a GREAT companion to the book. Early readershad free access, hurry now and check if it is still free.<br /><br />If you want to do a web based startup, this book is for you.
B006X96PF6|5.0|In its own way, I can only liken this to much earlier settings by musical icons such as Oscar Peterson's \\"Exclusively for my Friends\\". It proves with utter conviction that you are in the presence of consummate artistry and storytelling. If you are not familiar with Lorenna, this is an exceleent place to start; if you are familiar, for what else could you possibly be waiting?

B0051HNMTI|4.0|I hadn't considered carrying around a workout routine on my phone until I saw this as FAOTD. I expected the download to be Wi-Fi only due to the size of the app since it contained videos of each exercise. Pleasantly surprised, this app is only 9MB, pretty small considering all the video in it.<br /><br />It took a while, but I finally did see a \\"glitch in the matrix\\" and caught that the videos are indeed looped, which is what allows this app to be so small. The app itself is simple and functional. I do wish it allowed for a landscape view so the videos could be bigger, and I expected a widget with this to remind you to do your daily workout.. or track progress.<br /><br />In the end, the videos are extremely well done and the developers took pains to make sure they didn't load down your device with tons of unnecessary videos. If you want to carry around a workout on your phone or tablet, grab this as Free App of the Day. The videos are quality enough that it's easily worth $1 when this app isn't free.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|I don't like reviews anymore. I am getting too old to listen to people telling me what I should and shouldn't like (or \\"waste my money on) I just feel compelled to write a review because the people who hated this movie and rated it 1 star bothered me so much. I am not bothered because they didn't like it. Hey, if we all liked the same things then life would be so boring. It has just gotten to a point where I can not tolerate people that are so self centered that they think their opinions are facts. These people can't say \\"I found the movie boring and it lacked the humor that I appreciate\\" NO. These people have to tell you that that just because they hated the movie than it must be a horrible movie and either no one will like or there is something wrong with the people who do like it!! (The Mighty Oz has spoken!!)<br /><br />I knew when I saw this movie in the theater with a few of my friends that it wasn't going to be a movie for everyone. (we all loved it by the way) I am glad that a friend of mine wasn't able to go with us because I know she would have thought it was boring. It was very slow paced (and if you like car chases, sex scenes, and whatever else is the big draw these days then forget it) ... But I LOVE \\"boring\\" movies (I have been watching British movies for years LOL) This isn't a movie for the 20 somethings<br /><br />People are complaining it wasn't funny. Steve Martin and Jack Black are known for a certain humor ... well Martin is in his mid 60's and Black is showing his mature side (so sue him for wanting to play more than the clown - although he is still a bit type cast here). I thought it was just the right kind of funny. It also told a great story<br /><br />Bottom Line: I really had no idea what this movie was about. A friend dragged me to it. I hate birds. This film was extremely enjoyable ... TO ME. This, like ALL REVIEWS, is just an opinion. Agree with me or don't. I don't care.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My co-worker told me to read this book a year ago and I was not really interested. Not until I saw the previews for the movie and heard the hype did I read it. I read it in three days. Very hard to put down. I'm on the second book now and just as exciting! You can't go wrong with this one. So glad I decided to read it!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This app is GREAT! I needed to edit a paper on the go, and this did the trick perfectly. It's worked far better than any other document editting app I've worked with thus far. My only complaint is that it doesn't display some characters correctly. That may be the device's fault though. - On a Kindle Fire.
0307957934|4.0|What makes The Fear Index a super thriller is the fine writing of Robert Harris, whose very different book \\"Pompeii\\" I had previously read.  The Fear Index is exciting and the research about financial markets, which forms the central element of the novel, is impressive---Harris really knows what he's writing about.  But, the plot itself is a little over the top and lacks some important elements of credibility.  I found the characters somewhat stereotyped, but the plot is thrilling and, at times, the suspense grueling.  For me, the best parts of the book were Harris' fine descriptions and characterizations of super-rich investors, as well as his sense of the Swiss and of Geneva.  All in all, this is an entertaining book and one that relentlessly moves forward.

0439023483|5.0|I don't know that I can say anything in a review that hasn't already been fervently said on this thrilling set of novels.  I do know that people I didn't even know would see me reading it in public and begin gushing about it, and conversations diving into deep matters of social structure have developed.  This series (with the upcoming movies) is more than just entertainment.  It has the power to change the way people think if the right conversations get going.  The buzz is widespread. Our culture just might see a smack in the face for its idiocy.<br /><br />For me, the entire series truly plays upon the real-life disease we as a culture seem to be stuck in:  obsession with reality tv.  How far would our own society go to entertain an audience while simultaneously keeping the public distracted from the realities of government activity? I especially enjoyed that ultimately our beloved Katniss Everdeen realizes that pawns are used for propaganda and grim sacrifices are made on both sides of war. These books really hit home for me...this isn't just the future.  This is now.<br /><br />I personally read the ENTIRE series within a few days and I haven't been this engrossed in a series in a long time.<br /><br />I think these books should be added to required reading for teens in schools alongside classic social commentary and dystopian futures such as 1984 and Animal Farm.<br /><br />I also want to note I purchased the movie guide 'book' and the author of these novels was there every second for the choosing of the actors, the design the costumes,and also wrote the script for the movies.  Every change that will likely be in the movie was pre-authorized by her.  I'm one of those people who gets upset when changes are made in book to movie adaptations, but knowing she gave everything the green light and knowing the director didnt do anything without her consent makes me very excited for once about book to movie adaptations.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so glad to have this app. Now I can take the Bible with me everywhere I go.<br /><br />Love it!
B005T5DLFW|5.0|This story intrigued me with the condition the main character had, that caused him to see people known to him previously, as strangers now.  The fact that he would recognize someone by voice, if unseen, was a tricky detail with his wife and daughter.  I was prepared to grab the daughter when she rushed in the door to see her father toward the end.  The whole program kept growing in intensity to the bitter end.
B005N0PJJO|3.0|Having read all three books in this series can clearly show I am a fan. It wasn't necessarily well written but it was a fun, sexy and entertaining read. I enjoyed following the journey of this couple through their ups and downs.
B005QWL650|4.0|This was an interesting story, partially told by the man who was running his video recorder.  Initially I was confused with the red dot showing up on the screen, and then I realized what was happening.  The writers keep coming up with more and more twists of main characters, but the BAU team does their job well!

B006UKFFE0|5.0|On my third startup, I was pleased to finally come across a practical tool implementing many of the best startup practices that I've learned. We've had Ash review our current startup, applying the Running Lean lens, and his insights both in the book and in person are extremely valuable.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Ash Maurya's book \\"Running Lean\\" is the perfect jump off point for anyone considering or involved in a start-up organization. The book describes how to develop an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for your organization and how to focus on that MVP in order to prevent wasted resources, such as time and money. It also describes the most important part of any start-up or organization that seeks to solve a problem and that is establishing feedback learning loops in order to quickly make the changes that your customers and clients want or need most.
B005LJITS0|4.0|I enjoyed Green Lantern decently. It's a space opera type fantasy story, ridiculous of course, but the movie approached it straight and handled it well. It can't be easy to provide visceral impact to such elusive concepts as green constructs made of will power, but they did it.I was not confused at all by any of the story line although I never really read many GL comics. The actors did a nice job. Green Lantern's mask was kind of not right. When Hal reveals his identity to Carol her reaction is priceless.
0375836675|4.0|I absolutely loved The Book Thief and was looking for something else by this author.  This book is a lot different but I thought it was very engaging and I really enjoyed reading it.  I stayed up quite late several nights in a row reading and recommended it to my friends.  It's not life changing but better than most of the books I've read recently.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|The main thing I need to say about this movie, which was a better than OK intro to Cap, is that Captain America should have his jaw set and mouth closed, not be sucking wind with his mouth hanging open like some slack-jawed hillbilly. How did nobody notice this about Chris Evans's performance?<br />Please, Chris, mouth closed! Think of yourself as a General, not as a Confused Teenager!
0545265355|5.0|I loved the series. I bought the trilogy because I had heard great things about it and I wasn't disappointed at all! Don't expect this to be any literary masterpiece because this was made for children/teenagers, but expect some great parts that teach about morals, values, and perseverance. The books were also creatively written about a time when the world has suffered so much war and change that all there's left is Panem and it's 12/13 districts. The idea of an actual Hunger Games is incredibly unoriginal especially because of why the Games are held in the first place. This story is about strength, courage, hope, love and so much more. It's not meant to be some overwhelmingly inspirational literary masterpiece, but it is an incredible story of a teenager girl who acts just like a teenage girl yet is forced to grow up and mature quickly. I read it in 4 nights and I can say that there were 2 parts in the book where I actually teared up a little. Definitely not a mind blowing, intellectually stimulating read, but it was a good story with some unexpected turns.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|The Dark Knight is a herky-jerky disconnected series of scenes and performances that don't quite add up or flow together. Of course the Joker performance is fantastic. Christian Bale obviously phones it in. I've watched the movie twice hoping to find some Batman magic in it but sadly there is very little.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Prior to reading this book I had little personal knowledge of Apple products or Steve Jobs. After reading the book I have made it a point to find out more as I was extremely impressed with how Apple has developed. Jobs was obviously a very special person and I found the book portayed both the good and the bad about Jobs. Very good book.

Ash has delivered the best practical approach to applying the theory of Lean to your real world opportunities. The examples are clear, concise and easy to follow. You'll be itching to create for your first canvas before you've finished the book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is a great way to remote into your home pc and control every aspect from your mobile phone or tablet.  I like it much better than Team Viewer because you can use your touch screen to directly interact as the mouse cursor including clicks and double clicks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games remind me of the brain traders I use to play as a child and some of the classics on the Atari gaming system. It is the right level of difficultly to play with kids and just sum mind relaxing time. Great can't wait to unlock them all. Best part free!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is one of those books you just can't put down. Although I am not a big sci-fi fan, I found this book a fascinating read. The main character is very well-developed and she is likeable; those around her are less developed but are expanded enough that the reader relates to and understands their motives. Even less sterling characters have redeemable attributes which make them human. The theme of a \\"Big Brother\\" government brings this classic idea into the modern world.

B007E6YYLO|5.0|First off, if your parents did not teach you the difference between real life and TELEVISION...you are a lost soul. Season 2 of the Walking Dead so far has been fantastic. The characters are really starting to bloom into the family unit, fractured as it may seem. The WOMEN (Poppy, this is for you) are the strength and unity that keeps this new formed group together, it's WHAT WOMEN DO!!!! Shane is a loose cannon, but Rick is still his partner/best friend. He's not gonna let Shane cascade into a mental oblivion. Rick is going to take control of their situation and help Shane and the others. Rick is the leader. I just hope that he realizes that Russel is just a boy and under supervision, is not a threat to the group. The women, are the core of this group. Their story will unfold slowly but surely because they are the heart of the Walking Dead.

B0070TDERU|5.0|This series has something to appeal to everyone, that's why is is such an enourmous hit! The carefully detailed story keeps one guessing and anxious to follow every clue. I just bought one episode that I had missed on TV and needed to know what had transpired before going on to the next episode.<br />The quality of the download was excellent and enjoyable even on a small computer screen.

B005I4JG80|5.0|I don't take the time to review many books, but I felt I had to in this case. I saw this fleetingly in a bookstore and made a note to try a sample. I thought it was fiction (I didn't have time to actually pick up the book), and I was looking forward to a simple read on a long flight. As always I checked the ratings and was horrified to find that (at the time) almost all of them were from people who saw the author on TV, or read an excerpt in an article and were actually reviewing that short exposure. That's not a book review, and Amazon shouldn't allow it.<br /><br />I liked the sample so I ordered the book. LOVE LOVE LOVED it! I'm definitely not a Francophile, so I wasn't predisposed to like the strategy. I was however, intrigued by the concept once I read it. What I enjoyed most is that this is more of an objective study of the contrast between the cultures through the eyes of an American ex-pat living in Paris, but married to a Brit. Wonderful fodder for an assessment of cultures. I particularly liked that she nicely blended actual research with her own personal family experiences. Much more interesting than a parenting book that is written by someone who isn't the primary caregiver. Definitely worth the time, and very interesting!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|The Walking Dead is a great graphic TV show. Most of the charcters have different persoalaties witch makes you not know what is going to happin. I have seen every episode and I love it. If you are going to watch it you should start at season 1. The show is on at 9:00 eastern time on AMC.
1433502410|5.0|I own a number of commentaries and other Bible study books, but this one has so many relevant and useful items in it that I couldn't pass it up. The essays on the origins, translation, and interpretation of the Bible are incredibly deep. Much deeper than the typical study Bible. There are hundreds of maps and charts like the map showing the journeys of Elisha or the military campaigns of Joshua. Excellent!! The study notes are pointed and do a great job of illuminating the text.<br /><br />For those new to Bible study, this book will get you up to speed quickly. For those who have studied the Bible over the years but want a compact, thorough book that will be a regular reference this will make a great addition to your library. It's great for researching sermons or you can easily use it to do family devotionals. Lots of great, full color illustrations to keep the kids interested.<br /><br />Note on the Kindle edition. For such a large book, it is remarkably easy to navigate in the newer Kindles. You can enter chapter and verse and go directly to the verse instantly. Crossway has made its illustrations and charts available on line if you want to see them in their full splendor so you won't be shortchanged in any way by going with the Kindle version.<br /><br />Even if you own other study Bibles you will find new and valuable tools in this one. The ESV text is a literal translation, but it preserve much of the readability you get with a NIV Bible. Look at the first few verses in Hebrews in the KJV and compare with the ESV. The ESV breaks up the confusing run on sentences so they make more sense.<br /><br />I think most Christians who do any kind of Bible study will be blessed by this incredibly useful repository of Bible knowledge.

B004LWZW7O|4.0|Not sure what it is about this movie but I love it. I feel there is lots of action, mystery, thrills, and chills to meet anyone's demands. This movie is really starting to make me believe that Justin Timberlake actually has acting talent. The idea of buying everything on time to me tells people to not take for granted what they have as you may only have it for a short time before it is gone. Being only 28 years old I couldn't imagine living in a world like that; although somewhat similar to this world, you don't die here if you run out of money. Its an edge of your seat fun movie and I really enjoyed watching it with my wife. If you have a surround sound turn it up as this movie blasts some awesome sounds out throughout the entire movie. This is a good movie to watch on a Saturday night with the misses.

Well my chance came back week before last and it was in the Gold Box again and I didn't wait this time. Yes there is some graininess but in all honesty I feel that just adds to the movie and the entire feeling as a whole. Myself personally I feel this collection is great; there are some touch-ups done but for the most part it is intact and enjoyable for me. I love these kind of mobster flicks and they make up a good bit of my collection and I will say when it comes to mobster type movies this one is at the top of the list. If you want something that is the latest and greatest just wait for a decent mobster flick to come out but you will be missing out on this classic that is for sure.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|I honestly really enjoyed this movie. I loved the original \\"The Thing\\" and I love how they tied it into the original. I feel that I better understand the 2nd movie in this series (The original film) now that I know where the dog came from and why they were chasing it. Now I want to see another movie in this series come out just because I feel it was done very well with respect to the original. This movie is for the true scifi horror geeks enjoyment for sure.

159562015X|1.0|I purchased this a year ago and  am finally reading Strengths Finder by Tom Rath. The book is designed to work with a website using a unique access code.  Unfortunately, the supplier used the code, included it in the resale copy, and resold the book anyhow rendering it completely useless.<br /><br />You can't use an access code twice!!  If I had access to the used book dealer, I would fire off my complaint to him/her and give them \\"0\\" !!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|I originally saw this movie on tv while living in Germany. It was very frustrating when the Germany language wasn't translated but I could still tell it was a great movie so I bought it. It's a lot more graphic then I remembered probably due to the fact I saw it on tv but still a great movie.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|\\"The Grey\\" is a suspenseful film that I recommend thoroughly.  It' very intense; by no means is it a date movie.  Indeed, it was unexpectedly good.<br /><br />The movie involves a very dramatic plane crash somewhere in Alaska or northern Canada in the depth of winter.  I might add that the crash itself is brilliantly crafted.  Top film making!  There are a handful of survivors and if the crash wasn't bad enough, they now have to contend with ravenous wolves.<br /><br />It would be wrong of me to reveal any further details as to the ultimate outcome.  However, I can say that the terror of this Arctic wasteland really is frightening.  Liam Neeson plays the de facto leader of the group.  He has clear experience with the landscape and wolves; he was employed by the oil company for which they all worked as a wolf hunter.  But now he has no weapons and has to rely upon ingenuity and cunning.  He rises to the occasion.<br /><br />Although this film has had none of the publicity of the various Oscar nominees, it is still well worth seeing.  Just don't expect a happy story about furry animals.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is a great show from HBO, and at ~$3 per episode on Blue Ray it's a fabulous buy! Can't wait to watch it again...
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|I liked the idea of the story , but was disappointed with the way it was written.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed the way the story went back and forth between future and past, I did not find this annoying as other readers have.<br /><br />I did get very bored with the endless description of the architecture and clothing, I skipped so many pages!!!!!!<br /><br />As I mentioned, I think the story was a great idea,  but I feel - for me -  something was just missing, it never really delivered.  There seemed to be a lot of writing about stuff that didn't  matter.... as if the author had been tasked with writing a certain number of pages.  Maybe if  the  characters would have been developed a  bit more, or those events that actually impacted the story had been developed more, I might have felt pulled in.<br /><br />I was really annoyed with the \\"case of the missing character\\",  as other reviewers have referred to her.  Throughout the book there are references to a sixth member of the gang, a female who  seems to have had a serious relationship with the main character and has left him heartbroken.  All though all the characters in the story knew of her, the reader is never enlightened ..........I just didn't get the point.<br /><br />I am not going to recommend it at the current price $7.99 Kindle, maybe if it was .99, also I will not be reading the second book.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|Works like a charm on Kindle Fire!. It was very helpful in positioning the Router. I was amazed how much difference it made with the Wi-Fi signal after re-positioning the router just few feet higher of it's original place. I love the different visual options and audio beeps from the app that makes your work easy to read the signal strength and also different recommendations as to which channel is less crowded in your area.<br /><br />I can see it very useful for anyone who roams a lot with their kindles and want to find the best Wi-Fi in the locality.<br /><br />Super useful. Now ... I wish it could also detect leaking pipes around the house :-)<br /><br />Five Stars! Kudos to the Developer and making this app FREE!

B006UKFFE0|5.0|\\"This [Lean Startup Movement] is probably the first methodology that's been crowdsourced. Big idea. Unlike previous methodologies where there was an author, textbook and take-it-or-leave-it, this is an iterative process and I think we're all collectively getting smarter at a very scary rate.\\"<br />-Steve Blank<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Written in the same actionable style as 37 Signals Getting Real, Ash Maurya has supplanted the former as THE guide for bootstrapping and launching a web-based startup. If you're building a new product and haven't read Running Lean, take a break from your startup and go get it.  His advice could change your life.<br /><br />The Book<br /><br />Running Lean presents a process of discovering a market demand based on Customer Development, Lean Startup, Bootstrapping and his own, in-the-trenches experiences. He addresses the unsexy, tough, practical, day-to-day challenges faced by TODAY'S entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Forget the generic, one-size-fits-all advice (e.g. \\"focus on your market!\\", \\"follow your passion!\\") typically shoveled at us by people whose good intentions exceed their experience.<br /><br />Just as the tagline of his blog promises - practice trumps theory - Ash delivers actionable advice and opinions on question such as:<br /><br />How do you know if have a problem worth solving? Who do you ask and how do you structure the conversation? Should you record it? Take notes? What do you do afterward?<br /><br />Should I \\"just build it\\"?<br /><br />Should you quit your job? Raise money?<br /><br />Finally - I get it<br /><br />I've been closely following the Lean Startup Movement since 2008: read 4-Steps multiple times, follow Lean Startup Google Group, started a Lean Startup Meetup Group in DC, read Ash's blog, attended Eric's conference in San Francisco...you get my point:<br /><br />I live this stuff.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I've found myself struggling to unify the theoretical basis of the Lean Startup movement with the grab-bag of tactics advocated by companies at various stages of maturity.<br /><br />I kept running into \\"what should I do now\\" questions.<br /><br />Running Lean Works<br /><br />I decided to restart my work on my last startup (even though I was getting traction) in 2011 by following Running Lean from page 1. I've made more progress in 7 weeks than I did in the previous 5 months.<br /><br />In retrospect, I was doing many RIGHT things at the WRONG time.<br /><br />Running Lean has brought clarity to the issues I need to address today.<br /><br />Like me, you probably won't follow his approach exactly and will develop your own hacks and competing ideas along the way.

0060899190|5.0|Awesome book. My husband is in love with this author and he has me hooked on the post secret books.
0545265355|3.0|I was first introduced to the trilogy by a 7th-grade girl that I tutor. She was gushing about it all the time, and then I started to hear about it from other sources as well. So I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />The Hunger Games was a nice surprise. At times, I would have trouble imagining this place called Panem and District 12 that is something of a mix of bits and pieces of past, present, and future eras. But it didn't bother me much as I read on, greedily following the fates of our main characters every night and waking up in the morning with bloodshot eyes. Maybe Katniss dwells a little too much on keeping both of her potential boyfriends. Well, she's only sixteen. A strong and determined, if a bit strong-headed, sixteen-year-old at that. I liked her.<br /><br />I moved on to the next book--Catching Fire--and it was all right. The old love triangle. Stress, fear, anger, and frustration everywhere. The only part that really bugged me was when Collins actually put Katniss into another emotionally draining Games. I felt so tired already, but as it turned out, the new characters and a new arena succeeded in making me hooked again.<br /><br />The last book, Mockingjay, was a mixed bag. The first half I didn't care much for. Our protagonist is pretty much lost, somehow more childish than her year younger self, and simply annoying at times. When the main character has no direction and cannot figure out anything on her own unless others spell everything out for her, it's hard to stay interested in following her story. (Funny that she reminded me of Sailor Moon at one point, the stupid and bratty girl who would be nothing without her friends and allies. I have fond memories of Sailor Moon, but a flaw is a flaw!) The gazillions of nightmare scenes and drugged scenes served well enough to illustrate Katniss' fragile and damaged state, but I wondered if so many of them were needed in order to do so. They were just filling space after a while. I felt that while Collins described Katniss losing herself, she also lost some control of storytelling and character development.<br />The second half seemed to be all right. there were a few great moments. Reflection. everyone growing up. I thought the book would save itself after all, until Katniss sees the kids separated in the yard. I couldn't buy it from that point on. Things were just too disconnected, too sudden, too random to be convincing and realistic. Even the resolution to the love triangle felt weak; had it been the other boy that went back to District 12, she would have fallen in love with him and justify it just as well. I guess I was really dissatisfied with the way this trilogy had wrapped up.<br /><br />I wonder if the movies will improve the trilogy as a whole. I'm hoping for less narration of the obvious by Katniss and more of her action. As for the books, keep in mind that this is a young adult novel, and I think you'll enjoy it.

B002361MLA|5.0|I have just finished the book and despite the fact that this is old knowledge this is presented in a way more accessible to the western minds. It may be however difficult to fully understand it if you are not already at the level he speaks about. The ego does not let one free so easily and you cand find yourself with a more subtle form of ego or identification.<br />Some more points:<br />- innocence is the root quality that can get you there<br />- no amount of effort can get you there, you just need to let go, this can be however very difficult<br />- being in the presence of people who experienced it already will help a lot<br />- if anyone is trying to charge you money for this self knowledge than there is something wrong<br />- the future belongs to those who will go through this transformation<br /><br />I have got my self realization in Sahaja Yoga.  Lots of people experienced already this awareness and I am always happy to be in their presence.

B0047GNCSU|5.0|I grew up in Texas, but have family near Laguna Beach and was always envious of people who actually got to LIVE there. When Laguna Beach first aired I couldn't help but get hooked because she was living the life I always thought I wanted. Beautiful town, tons of opportunites, trendy stores, and the money to be able to enjoy it all. I understand reality tv isn't \\"real\\", but reading her novel made me understand her in a way I hadn't before. I loved this book and am currently reading the second. I found it interesting to get a peek behind the show with the most likeable character.
0385474547|5.0|If you are just looking for a good book to read, you will enjoy this one.  And if you are seeking an understanding of African culture, this book could help.  But this work by Achebe is focused clearly on revealing the conflict in most culturally mixed societies today.  The problem is not one of values but of the expression of those values.  This is a great book to help the reader understand people of other cultures by seeking to understand their values and the expression of those values in comparison to those of the reader.  Being able to see the values of others aids in bringing people together to create a healthy living environment by reducing the conflicts often manifest in value expressions. This book was a required reading in a Cultural Anthropology Class and an enjoyable book to read.  I highly recommend it to people of all Religions and Cultures.
1901464253|3.0|This is basically the book about the origin of the Brompton. Described almost every single important moment of the bicycle and the inventor's life (even his predecessors!)<br />The author focused on the early life of the bike so the story of the bike and the company after year '00 are very little.<br />It's entertaining to read the history about them but when it comes to the technical aspects of the bike, it's not good enough. The author is quite biased to the Brompton (understandable of course, it's a Brompton book!).<br /><br />The reason I rated this just 3 stars mainly because the quality of the book itself. There's no margin, no paragraph on the page, full text from top left to the bottom right. This is really difficult to read. The artwork is high-school level and should have had more pictures correlate to the story as well. I have read \\"Spaceframe Moultons\\" by Tony Hadland recently, it's in the same genre but Tony is better in writing techniques and in terms of detail of the bike.<br /><br />If you are the fan of the Brompton, it's worth reading it!  it's the only choice!

B004YHRZLM|5.0|I had loved Dumbo as a child and had not seen it for many years, so I got the special edition DVD. The special features on this edition are marvelous, with so many people expressing their sentiments about the movie and what it was meant to be and how much Walt loved it and what an important movie it was for the studio. There's also some deleted scenes including Timothy the mouse singing. The commentary is by 3 people who currently work for the Disney studios and they had a lot of things to say. Apparently Dumbo is a very special movie to many people. The movie is an extraordinarily simple story about the imbecilic reasons snobby people invent to hate someone or disregard someone or look down on someone--a guy has big ears that nobody else around him has and that makes them think he's worthless. His ears are not hurting anybody, they just look unusual. The reason they hate him is nothing but the fact that he's DIFFERENT from them in that one little way, in one aspect of his physical appearance. He has a physical trait that noone else around him has and that makes them act like he's a disgrace to them. I am really appalled at the little reasons that people use to hate others. And Dumbo's mother is punished for defending her son, for punishing a mean bully who was hurting her son, and she's classed as dangerous and chained as if she's evil. I too have been punished for violence when I was defending innocent ones against bully's meanness.  Noone in the movie cared that she had a reason for what she did.<br />Dumbo is about judgement and intolerance and oppression and unfair discrimination. From what I've seen, most of the time in real life victims of unfair societal views do not end up triumphing over the oppression the way Dumbo does in the movie. But I guess the movie is a message of hope that maybe we can hope to change some of the unfair things about the way society works, so that innocent people like Dumbo and his mother can have freedom. I don't know if the movieDumbo can make the world a better place--there are a lot of hypocrites who love the movie Dumbo, they love the movie and spend money on it to buy it but they themselves are treating people and animals in rude unfair ways, so they love the movie but they themselves are cruel and bitter and judgemental and so they obviously have no regard for the messages of love and understanding in the movie--but I agree with the people on the DVD that it is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. I wish the movie Dumbo could have an effect on the way people are treated in society. There are so many people living in imposed situations that are not fair, but I guess when life is not fair they have to just go on living while the unfair situation is going on, and that's another message in the movie--Timothy tells Dumbo to go on living even before they learn that there's a way Dumbo can have victory over the situation. Before they ever knew that Dumbo could fly, they were already going to just continue living. I wish this movie could help spread goodness in the world. I love this movie.
B001IL1AMW|5.0|Instead of revealing any plot points like some other reviewers (which btw is really annoying so lets work on that people) This is a episode worth watching and has lots of funny little ways to pull truths out of people. Classic star trek gimmick, create random person x with crazy fetish x and some science gibber jabber and you have this great emotional story. Have fun watching!

The Lean Canvas approach, used in conjuntion with the learnings found in Eric Reis Lean Start-Up and Running Lean, is explained in an easy to implement way. Ash shows you how to do it, step by step. This is leading edge thinking. It makes so much sense and is so well explained that I predict it will challenge and disrupt most of the other \\"how-to's\\" and the conventional wisdom of MBA programs.

I couldn't put Delirium down and i even cried at the end, but Pandemonium is written much differently and lost me at some points. All in all its a good read and the cliff hanger ending is sooo worth reading the book. I would be lying though if i said i wasn't slightly disapointed with it. I have a feeling the next one will be amazing though.I hate that the third book isn't being released for another year.

While these are all really good, Ash's book is by far the best. He mixes the right amount of high level thinking with concrete tactics (worksheets, lean canvas, interview scripts, etc) on how to execute. If you had only one book to read, IMHO, this is it.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I have been following Mr. Maurya for some time now with his blog, Running Lean book, and Lean Canvas web application. He has honed and refined the message of how to approach building a company through iterations better than anyone out there. His instructions are clear and 100% practical without any of the dogma. It's all about building a company/product that someone wants and KNOWING that someone wants it, demonstrably, from the very beginning. This is not a new concept but Maurya's treatment of the process is clear and concise without a lot of fluff. Excellent book. I recommend it highly!
0525478817|3.0|*Note: I debated long and hard whether or not to write/ post a review of this book (mainly because my opinion of it is different from that of the large majority)- it was only after having spoken/ been encouraged by a fellow book blogger that I decided to do so.*<br /><br />I recently picked this book up after seeing tons of Tweets and blog posts telling me (or, you know, just people in general) that I \\"HAD TO READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT IS QUITE LITERALLY THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD- ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? SCREW SLICED BREAD, IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THAT!\\" But after reading it, I must admit, that I am a bit disappointed.<br /><br />I think that my largest complaint about this book was the characters- I understand that Hazel and Augustus have had to mature quicker than their peers because of their circumstances- but seriously? I would consider myself to be a somewhat educated person and I had no idea what they were saying half of the time (admittedly, I did pull out a dictionary here and there and I did reread entire portions of the book multiple times to have a better comprehension of what was going on). At time while listening to their speeches I felt like I was sitting in one of my lectures with one of my pretentious forty + year old (NOTE: not 16 year old) professors droning on and on about something inconsequential that they think is profound.<br /><br />Also, I really, really, really wanted to cry while reading this book and I didn't (which let me tell you, isn't all that difficult of a task because I cry like it's nobody's business- that Tim Horton's commercial where the Haitian man welcomes his family to Canada? I cried. That Tropicana orange juice commercial where the company provided Alaska with a fake sun during their 24-hour nighttime? I bawled like a baby. And don't get me started on when a family member- especially children- visit competitors on shows like \\"Survivor\\"- I am an absolute puddle and it takes me forever to compose myself). I think that why I didn't cry is because I just knew that someone was going to die (I mean, it is a \\"cancer\\" book)- perhaps had the synopsis been more mysterious (like the synopsis of \\"Little Bee\\" by Chris Cleave, \\"We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it. Nevertheless, you need to know something, so we will just say this: It is extremely funny, but the African beach scene is horrific. The story starts there, but the book doesn't. And it's what happens afterward that is most important. Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds.\\") what occurred it in would have taken me more by surprise (I would have been less prepared for what was going to happen) and as a result, tears would have trickled down my face, as I had so wanted them to?<br /><br />That being said, I did love the parts of the book when Augustus and Hazel dropped the facade and just let themselves be teenagers- I just found these parts to be genuine and something that I could truly connect to and understand. This part especially:<br /><br />  \\"He's not that smart,\\" I said to Julie.<br />  \\"She's right. It's just that most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.\\"<br />  \\"Right, it's primarily his hotness,\\" I said.<br />  \\"It can be sort of blinding,\\" he said.<br />  \\"It actually did blind our friend Isaac,\\" I said.<br />  \\"Terrible tragedy, that. But can I help my own deadly beauty?\\"<br />  \\"You cannot.\\"<br />  \\"It is my burden, this beautiful face.\\"<br />  \\"Not to mention your body.\\"<br />  \\"Seriously, don't get me started on my hot bod. You don't want to see me naked, Dave. Seeing me naked actually took Hazel Grace's breath away,\\" he said, nodding toward the oxygen tank.' (pg. 251).<br /><br />All in all, I wish that this book was more accessible and more suited for the targeted audience- my younger sister (who fits smack-center into the targeted audience) is a HUGE fan of Lurlene McDaniel and her cancers books and I would love to have her read this book, but I know that she, too, would have difficulties trudging through it and that the large majority of it would go over her head (which I don't mean in any offense to her). In all honesty, I am on the fence about whether or not I will pick up another John Green book after having read this.-center into the targeted audience) is a HUGE fan of Lurlene McDaniel and her cancers books and I would love to have her read this book, but I know that she, too, would have difficulties trudging through it and that the large majority of it would go over her head (which I don't mean in any offense to her).

I really like the song Propaganda too.  However, since the beginning Sepultura suffered from an originality problem.  This is supposed to be chaos A.D., but there is nothing chaotic about it.  That is, they are doing what has been done before them.  However, in this case hoards of bands were doing the Slayer sound.  In fact, Slayer even used terminology for it, \\"Slayer Babies.\\"  That is there is very little difference between this and the band Slayer.  This album is slightly different though.  It is a little bit more stompy than Sepultura's previous efforts, but that just makes them more like Pantera.  And, even Pantera was criticized for being a copy cat band.  In the end though, I find the album Chaos A.D. to be a good listen.  Almost all the tracks are good.  If someone put this on for me in the player, I'd certainly enjoy it.  I mean hell.  It's simple music, essentially punk blues, yet every once in a while it is fun to pull out.  At this point, I think the best part about Chaos A.D. is that I could use it to help teach someone guitar.  Why?  Because it is a little slower than Slayer, and the lead guitar work is a great place for someone to start if he or she is interested in playing metal.

B004LWZW42|5.0|This totally removed any fears I had of another X-Men sequel,  showing other franchises how a prequel should be filmed. With a setting that went from World War 2 up to the Kennedy's time in office, we not only had mutants but also a political portrait highlighting all the elements needed to bring mutants to light.<br /><br />The movie is really one dealing with the early years of the Magneto, how the X-Men became the X-Men, and just who the Hellfire Club is. I really thought the portrayal of many of the characters, especially Magneto and Sebastian Shaw, were top notch and captured, at least in part, what the comics noted about them throughout the years.<br /><br />Magneto's youth and the way the case was laid out, allowing him to age and to go from a helmet- mashing, anguish- driven youth to a tooth-puling, coin twirling adult really kept me captivated.  The rise of the X-Men was documented well enough, liberties, as always, taken with the storylines. The Hellfire Club also took the cake with their displays of out-and-out bloodshed, utilizing their powers in ways that the series had held back until then. It made the characters complex in some ways, showing just how \\"bad guys\\" might not be the baddies you think, and how \\"good\\" can be a relative term. the story of beast, how Mystique got involved with both X and Magneto, what happened with the Professor - they took these on as well.<br /><br />The effects were also stellar. From submarines rising from the depths looking realistic as powers attempted to pull them from the wave to missile showers freezing in mid-flight, I found myself happy and surprised. I expected less and liked this enough to want to go from renting to buying. you not only had big fights but also detail work that explained the characters and what they did, allowing anyone entrance into the ways mutants work. That was nice considering the fact that I watched this with my family and we all seemed to enjoy it.<br /><br />I think this was a good 5/5, possibly the best X-men film. I hope we see more done with this mix of story and power.sibly the best X-men film. I hope we see more done with this mix of story and power.

0525478817|5.0|I have written, deleted, and re written my review at least six times already. There are not enough words and positive adjectives filled with rainbows and unicorns to describe how amazing this book is.<br /><br />I don't normally cry while reading books or watching films. Hell, I didn't even cry during 'the notebook'. In fact, I hated that film, but that's not the point. The point is that when I finished this book, I had nearly gone through an entire box of tissues. Not to say that this book is depressing and makes you want to slit your wrists and die, it just pulls at your heartstrings in the most wonderful way. It makes you wish that these amazing young adults that have been created with the most eloquent and beautiful words, these strong, amazing kids that you have fallen so much in love with were real, so that you could hug them as tight as you possibly could and tell them that you will remember them. That you will tell their story and that they won't be forgotten.<br /><br />Well, dear reader, I haven't forgotten them, and I'm highly/ forcefully suggesting that you read their story, Hazel's story. It's a roller coaster of emotion, so hold on tight and be prepared to fall in love with this book.

B004QL7K6G|3.0|While it does not reach the apex of bizarro comedic genius attained by David Wain's cult classic Wet Hot American Summer, Wanderlust, penned by Wain and Ken Marino (Party Down), inspires enough laughs to allow its tepid plot to be overlooked, due in large part to the committed performances of its leads--notably Rudd, whose sexual-pump-up speech is one for the ages, proving that simple anatomy can be ridiculously funny when flowing from the right mouth. Other actors, like Marino, seem annoyingly misplaced and more than a few gags are clumsy, but ultimately this shaggy dog of a film rears its head in profane, gleeful confusion enough times to endear itself to you. Devotees of the cerebral and short-lived Stella will rejoice.<br /> The wavering plot concerns George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston), two New York up-and-comers whose lives are derailed by virtually spontaneous unemployment. The two have recently purchased a miniature apartment referred to as both a \\"studio\\" and \\"micro-loft,\\" depending on the whims of their avaricious and unhinged realtor. The apartment is the sort of place where the bed drops down from the wall and the addition of both a couch and an armchair would result in over-crowding. The New York scenes resound with satirical validity and are over perhaps too soon, resulting in a quasi-road picture vs. hippie-commune subplot that gradually grows to assimilate all other story threads. Pacing is Wanderlust's general flaw, with several scenes running too long--particularly those at Ken Marino's suburban hell castle which could have been handled during less intrusive (and plot-stalling) telephone conversations since watching grown men prance about smashing plates to express their ennui and women drinking into oblivion have been beaten to death and beyond in lesser movies.<br /> Wanderlust flounders when the action is confined to the hippie commune. Many subplots jump in and out including one in which a thoroughly gaunt and wheelchair bound Alan Alda attemptsto remember where he kept the deed to the commune, as vague land developers appear to have their eye on repossessing it. The best scenes are the ones which seem hijacked by David Wain and rise above cliche set-ups. Most of these include a hardly recognizable Justin Theroux whose attempts to free George's mind during an arm-swinging yoga session results in fabulous wordplay from Rudd. Funnier than Aniston up in a tree on DMT, which could have been handled better (though the hallucinations were amusing). Elsewhere, the film is enlivened by character actors like Joe Lo Truglio (he was the \\"you guys on myspace?\\" freak from Superbad and the guy with the weird voice from I Love You, Man) whose novelist character Wayne spends much more time running amok with his manhood exposed than he does writing his novel about \\"The Monster of the Beltway\\". Ultimately, Wanderlust flows in a typically deranged Wain manner with cars showing up in odd places, babies delivered at inopportune moments (and with gory results) and polygamy taking hold of the central plot. There is even some Stella-reminiscent action later on, once the tone of the film has been thrown headlong into madcap territory from which it emerges and drowns, emerges and drowns, dragging itself at last toward a smug, enjoyable finish.

I cannot do this book justice with my mere words, not so eloquently arranged as John Green's. I can simply tell you to buy it and read it for yourself.

B0072QPV6I|5.0|First of all, if you missed this last tour of the Chemical Brothers and were already a fan of them: Shame on you. You missed out on quite possibly one of the best live (yes electronic music can be live) productions of the last few years.<br /><br />Having seen the live show twice on their most recent tour, I am beyond ecstatic to know that I will soon be able to have dance parties in my own home with beautiful visuals and a flowing set. Like the review above me stated, this got people dancing in the movie theatres. When is the last time you heard of energy like that? They shut off the movie and the crowd boo'd to get them to turn it on again and at a louder volume.<br /><br />I'd like to also note that this film is one of the first to have the audio engineered in true 7.1 sound. That is huge.<br /><br />Buy it. It's worth it. The only thing that could make this better is the option of 3D (it looked stellar in the Kylie Minogue Blu Ray)<br /><br />You also get a live CD with the same tracks.<br /><br />Also; if you haven't purchased \\"Further\\" yet, do it (again).
B0059XTUXQ|4.0|Reviews that have criticized The Iron Lady for being a muddled patchwork of segments in the political life of Margaret Thatcher, scenes that took place without a context, have missed the point of the film.  This is not really a straight-on biopic of Margaret Thatcher, and thank goodness as I don't think I could have sat through a two and a half hour political film.  What it is, though, is a story about this larger than life political figure in her declining years whose mind is taking her back to various points in her life...as her memories come to her in segmented scenes, so does the movie.  True, I did learn more about Margaret Thatcher the politician than I had known; but more, I reveled in the story of a lonely, isolated woman who has kept company with her fragmented memories which included her relationship with her now deceased husband, her rise to power, and various scenes of her life in Parliament.  That Meryl Streep embodies Margaret Thatcher is an understatement, her performance is amazing, and her third Oscar win was truly deserved. But the movie's point of view is Thatcher's, and the movie-goer should watch this film through her eyes.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|20 minutes was enough of this film. Is it artistic? Yes. Does it have something to say about the human experience? Quite a bit, actually. Is it engaging? Nope. Could I get these questions from somewhere else and have time to dwell on them rather than look at artistic pictures that probably go on for an hour? Yes. Reminiscent of Kubrick's work and well loved by the critics. That said, I'll be using my movie time for something that considers holding the interest of the audience. MY GRADE: C minus; WHEN WATCHED: today.
0393338398|4.0|If you're a true baseball enthusiast, there's a reasonable chance you enjoy statistics.  Or at least, you're not afraid of them.  Michael Lewis is certainly counting on this fact from his target audience, because while half of Moneyball is a story about Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics, the other half is an often repetitive tale of the history of baseball statistics and scouting.<br /><br />I would say about 75% of this book is well written and insightful.  You get a thorough story of Billy Beane as the GM of the Oakland A's, but equally importantly you get his back story which explains how he came to be the man he is.  You get an understanding of how the sport of baseball was run before Billy Beane's impact as a GM.  You get the underdog story of a bunch of players whose hopes were all but lost, coming together to accomplish something incredible, even if it doesn't end in a championship.  When the book is good, it's great.<br /><br />Lewis only has one real stumbling point, as far as I'm concerned--he can repeat himself to drive a point home, well after the point is understood.  One of the key aspects of this book is looking into the history of baseball statistics, involving the writing of Bill James and the various organizations that started to analyze the game better than Major League Baseball did itself.  That's great, but there were times when Lewis simply kept writing when he didn't need to.  There were chapters that I'd start to read, and think, \\"Am I in the wrong place?  I'm pretty sure I read this exact same fact already...\\"<br /><br />Now, I'm a baseball enthusiast.  I'm a fan of math and statistical analysis.  I loved the overview of how these organizations were changing baseball statistics as we know them.  But when you're repeating the same statistics, or fawning over them in the same fashion, it can start to cause weariness.  That's what I felt, in some of the chapters Lewis presented on the statistics of baseball.  I'm not saying they weren't great; I loved them.  I only loved them, however, until I felt like I was reading them twice.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book I cannot strongly enough recommend to any baseball fan who's not deterred by the statistics that drive it.  It's a story of a man who didn't accept the norms just because it was the standard.  He challenged his team with success in the face of teams with higher payrolls by trying to reinvent scouting in Major League Baseball.  Whether or not you agree that he and Paul DePodesta found success in their methods, this is a book worth reading.  In 2002 I had a narrower view of baseball, being a grade school child rooting for one team and knowing little about statistics or any other teams.  Now that I can appreciate these facets of the baseball, I can't recommend this book more to anyone interested in the sport.at; I loved them.

0399159029|4.0|In this book, author Kerr does what he does best: tell the tale of Bernie Gunther's investigation that takes place in the heart of the Nazi regime during World War 2.<br /><br />In Berlin, Gunther's called in to investigate the rail yard murder of an immigrant worker. Before he can solve that one, he's directed to investigate another incident that may have espionage overtones. But once again, he's quickly commandeered by his old nemesis Rudolph Heydrich to go to Prague to join Heydrich's staff as his personal detective. One of Heydrich's aides turns up murdered, and it falls to Gunther to get to the bottom of the whole mess.<br /><br />In this book Kerr plays to his strength, placing Gunther in the middle of the morass that is the Nazi regime, with political concerns and hidden agendas affecting his every action. He can't trust anyone, and little is as it seems on the surface. Gunther has to conduct his investigation directly under the gaze of one of the most fearsome monsters of the Nazi regime, and get out with his skin intact.<br /><br />I've been a fan of this series since my first exposure with the \\"Berlin Noir\\" trilogy, and in my opinion the books that take place in the era immediately surrounding and during the war years are the best of them. The further Gunther moves from the war into the post-war era, the weaker the books become, culminating in last year's \\"Field Gray\\", which I considered a complete disaster, as it was nothing more than a showcase for Kerr's personal animosity toward the United States.<br /><br />But in \\"Prague Fatale\\", Kerr has returned to the classic formula that made this series such a hit to begin with, and earns a solid 4 stars.
1573229725|4.0|Susan Trinder is seventeen and a foster kid in a family of fingersmiths (thieves). She has been cared for and somewhat coddled if one can be in this environment. A plot is hatched whereby she is to act as a lady's maid to young and wealthy Maud Lilly. She is to gently push her into the arms of Mr. Rivers. Maude Lilly and Mr. Rivers get married and then put Maude in a nuthouse and make off with her fortune. On the surface that is the story. But nothing is as it seems and there are numerous twists and turns.<br /><br />This is a Victorian historical novel at its best. Full of dodgers, thieves, lunatics, murderers, swindlers, child marketers, charlatans,and orphans, this reads like a Dickensian book. And a la Waters style there is a little lesbian love thrown into the mix.<br /><br />This is a book where the reader is always wondering what will come next. Waters delivers a masterpiece that is a thrill to read. Waters develops her characters and plot superbly and this is a book not to be missed

0553582445|1.0|Like a stalk of grain in a high wind, our silly protaganist still goes any which way the wind blows in this follow-up to the Farseer trilogy.  Seems the only decision he's made all on his own was to hide out for years (like a big baby.)  Years have passed and due to lack of any other human interaction besides another kid, Fitz remains insecure, impressionable, and easy to lead around by the nose as always.  Soap-opera style interactions are also far too cheesy and predictable.<br /><br />Oh Hobb.  You wrote 3 outstanding novels with the liveship trilogy, but this Farseer thing is atrocious.  I won't be reading the rest of this trilogy, or anything else Hobb has written.  Very disappointed.

0375703861|3.0|White Teeth starts out laugh-aloud funny; Smith (at times) can equal John Kennedy Toole's classic 'Confederacy of Dunces' (transported from New Orleans to Cricklewood.) Her dialogue is superb; as she renders Jamaican patois or Bengali English you can almost 'hear' the characters.<br />The story concerns a mild-mannered white guy and his young Jamaican second wife. Equally important are his Bengali best friend, who served with him in WW2 and his wife and the children of both couples. Halfway through we encounter a left wing, middle class intellectual Jewish family, and their lives intertwine...<br />Up till the last chapter I felt that sections of the book- notably the episode on the War-were irrelevant, but the whole huge work does tie up at the end.<br />I was irritated by the factually inaccurate depiction of Jehovah's Witnesses. They do not go in for candles or crucifixes, they dont type up the Watchtower at their local Kingdom Hall (lot more organised than that!) and they dont attend rallies or sing C of E hymns.<br />This is a well written and entertaining work -but not a classic.

B006G2NVCA|4.0|David Fincher sticks with the Nine Inch Nails duo for this massive beast of a score that will take you multiple listens to fully appreciate what's going on here. That is if you have the patience and sanity to sift through all 3 discs of music. The Social Network was a great debut for Reznor but the score obviously lacked a lot even though the praise it got states otherwise. On the Blu-ray it was revealed that Reznor and Ross didn't score to picture and it was up to Fincher and his editor to craft a score out of the music that was produced. Now, I don't know what the process was this time but I would say they paid more attention to scene structure. A lot of scenes were edited well to the music, but then again the music could have been composed beforehand. Hopefully a featurette on the Blu-ray will reveal  the process.<br /><br />For what is included here there is a lot to be experienced, and more of it borders on sound design than say melodic or thematic music. This is a fully synthesized score that blends textures, tones, drones and atmospheres to craft certain emotional states. Any traditional score fan or traditional musician might scoff at this score, but the meticulous execution of it all gives everything an immense precision. I think any fan of Akira Yamaoka's scores to the Silent Hill games will appreciate this score immensely. It is dark and gritty and very ambient. The music will make you uncomfortable and unsettle you, but as a complete experience is strangely unique. While I can't say the music is as accessible as The Social Network it definitely absorbed me into a bizarre state of mind for the duration of the listen.<br /><br />This is a monster of a score that needs to be experienced, and I think everybody will take something different away from it. I can see a lot of people hating it and I can see a lot of people loving it. I do love it, and it works immensely well to the picture. It's definitely not a 1-note score but rather a very dynamic experience with multiple layers. The 3 CD's are worth going through as the layers peel away like an onion the deeper and deeper you go. Some of it may be confusing but all of it is startling in a good way.ith multiple layers. The 3 CD's are worth going through as the layers peel away like an onion the deeper and deeper you go.

Like most Nada Surf efforts, the first few listens are easy, but the real reward comes after many plays, when the subtleties of the songwriting begin to shine through.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King<br />11/22/63<br />Hardcover<br />Publisher: Scribner<br />Publication Date: November 8, 2011<br />ISBN-13: 978-1451627282<br />849 pages<br /><br />  I've always been a fan of Stephen King's work. However, I don't normally read a lot of horror, don't really enjoy being frightened out of my wits, and would much rather spend my time reading Science Fiction, Fantasy, or Poetry instead. But, there is always something compelling and interesting about every work by this grand master of dark fiction and I seek out and buy his new books whenever they are released. A few stand out to me as some of the most interesting books I've ever read. The Stand, Under the Dome, and the Dark Tower series for instance, will always be some of the most enjoyable reading I've ever done. But 11/22/63 stands alone among all of Stephen King's other works. Yes, it is as interesting and persuasive as anything he's ever written. Yes, he is the \\"everyman\\" of modern writers and proves it every time he sits down at his typewriter, including this time. Yes, he knows his audience and writes accordingly. But the assassination of John F. Kennedy still tugs at the hearts and minds of those who lived through those unhappy times, 11/22/63 even more so. King does not tell us what was lost on that fateful day in Dallas. He deftly, heartbreakingly shows us in infinite detail. The twists and turns found in this unique time-travel tale about the prevention of the assassination of JFK made my head spin, but in a good way. The consequences of time travel are clearly spelled out in King's alternate universe and the myriad of possible time-lines and \\"what-ifs\\" are indelibly written. What if you could travel to the past, stay as long as you wanted, and upon your return find that only two minutes had passed? What would you do with all that time? What would you do if you traveled to the past and found out that you had somehow become the world's worst enemy?

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I read the first and second drafts of this book before publication.  Ash was kind enough to share them with some readers of his blog.  I've since been waiting for it to come out so that I can point friends to it and suggest they buy it.

B00295UBTO|4.0|I was completely satisfied with my purchase and enjoy using my kindle. It's lightweight and ease of function makes it ideal to transport around and read when in between classes.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I absolutely love the Zip Sleeve for the Kindle Fire. This would not have been my first choice in a case (originally looked at a leather case). However, it works perfectly for me. I love being able to remove the Fire to use it especially since it's a touch screen. There is more freedom of use holding it in your hand even when viewing videos. I think people are making too big a fuss about the slight smell that is present. I'm guessing these are packaged pretty quickly following manufacturing and that is the chemical smell people notice. If it's bothersome, let it air out a few hours first. Other reviewers also mentioned that it was a tight fit for the Fire. Again, I've had mine a couple of weeks and now there is a slight give in the sleeve that makes it just perfect. It zips fine and keeps the Fire well protected. Love the coral color, love the Kindle fire, extremely pleased with the Zip Sleeve.

B006UG90RM|5.0|First let me start by saying to all of the one star haters. Get real this cd is overall very good. Is it excellent? Who knows? Time will be the judge on that. All that I know is this:<br /><br />It has been many years since I have set down and listened to every track on a 13 track cd and felt that each song was memorable or quality. Yes there are some cuts from edits from the 70's and 80's . SO WHAT... Van Halen has the creative license to use their own demos anytime they want. I was blown away at the old and the new. God bless Wolf , Eddie, Alex and Diamond Dave.<br /><br />My heart broke the Day Dave walked away and it has now been restored with his return. I only wish it had not take 27 years to get out the latest cd.<br /><br />With that said: Most Van Halen fans that have been with them since 1977 will agree it is good to hear Dave with the band once more. I miss Mike but Wolfie is pure and it doesn't get any more Van Halen than the three amigos.<br /><br />So God Bless, Gods speed and please Eddie. Don't wait 27 years to put out another cd with Dave.
B004132HZS|5.0|I bought the first episode on iTunes a couple of weeks ago. Ten minutes into the first episode I was hooked, and was downloading the other two episodes. Decided I wanted the dvd's so I'd have a hard copy of the series, and I wanted the little extras like the pilot episode and the commentaries too. Love it when they include things like that into a dvd set.<br /><br />Saw the second season already. Waiting for it to come out on dvd here in America to buy it. Cant wait for them to film the third season. This is probably one of the first series that I've seen that's been so well done that I only needed that first ten minutes to know that it was a favorite. I'll be looking at other BBC programming now that I've seen that they're better than Hollywood at producing good entertainment.<br /><br />The disks came quickly. Actually arrived a day before Amazon said it would be here. I might be buying another set of these disks to give to a relative that likes BBC programming.

B0063IH60K|3.0|I never have a winning game on random shuffel. I notice lag and glitches in the game. but it is free so cant complain
B003UESJ9W|3.0|This is a good movie that should have been a great movie.  The cast is fantastic.  The story line is strong.  The music is superb.  I'm not sure what went wrong.  Part of it has to do with a disjointed script, I think.  Part of it is probably due to less than stellar directing.  I'm not suggesting it's a one star movie, I was torn between rating it 3 or 4 stars, actually, because of all the good things it has going for it.  I don't think many people will watch this and consider it to have been a complete waste of time - I certainly didn't, and in truth I enjoyed watching it.  It's worthwhile simply because of Gwyneth Paltrow's performance alone.  I had no idea she was such a great singer.  I just can't escape the nagging feeling that it should have been better than it was.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|this is an excellent movie!! i'm waiting for the fourth one to come to DVD to complete my collection. I love it
B00563K3DA|3.0|This is an \\"ok\\" self-help type of book. You learn the same lessons about \\"slowing down and smelling the flowers\\" which is the typical recommendation of a high-powered business type or lawyer who has a scare (heart attack etc).<br />A decent read with a tale that all of us should hear from time to time-  then we go right back to normal after a frustrating drive home!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|for women. actually I have not downloaded this app but am giving it 5 stars in spite of the negative reviews. so in fact by trolling apps by giving it negative defeats the purpose. actually counter productive if you ask me. so in basic theory, a negative review by a troll will yield ~5 5 star reviews which equates to a 4 star average. little do these trolls realize they are helping these apps lol
B005QUQRE2|4.0|That's a question this movie never answers. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued. It looked like a remake of a movie from the 1960s called [[ASIN:B0016B6ZJW Journey to the Far Side of the Sun]]. So naturally I wanted to see it immediately. After seeing this movie, however, I doubt the two movies have much in common. I'm not sure since I still have not managed to get a copy of Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. It's been on my Wish List for a while. But as far as I know, they actually travel to the other Earth in that movie. In Another Earth, they do not. That was a big disappointment, as I was expecting them to.<br /><br />So... I was expecting to get a science fiction movie and really only got a drama. I wasn't even sure why they needed \\"Earth 2\\" to make this movie. I think it was really only necessary so they could ask all those deep questions like \\"What if you could meet yourself?\\" The movie was very successful in that respect: it asked a lot of questions and left the viewer to ponder them. It wasn't mere entertainment; it made you think.<br /><br />I was wondering one thing... if everything is identical on each Earth, you actually CANNOT meet yourself. When you get to the other Earth, the other you will just be on your Earth, because she will have done the same thing you did. But apparently, the synchronicity of the two Earths was broken once they became aware of each other. Imagine that. I think I would like to meet myself. Would I learn something, or would it just be pointless because she'd have the same brain as I have? Well, at least we could have an interesting conversation. Unless... we just kept predicting everything the other was about to say. In which case it would be boring. Yeah, I think this movie made me think a lot!<br /><br />I wish people wouldn't say things like \\"This was good for an indie.\\" \\"This was good for a low-budget film.\\" \\"This was good for a film without CGI.\\" This was good period. It was good because it was based on good acting and plot. You can have all the special effects you and want the movie will flop without acting and plot.ed on good acting and plot.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|What a bang for ur buck! I was obsessed with this game for weeks, with constant playing. I wish there were more games just like this. I eventually had to cheat a bit with an online walkthrough, but I am so pleased with this game. definitely check this one out if you like puzzles &amp; hidden objects.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|It works well, with lots of customization options. You can insert images too. I would like the ability to draw as well. But good app, so far.

B005RAQ4NU|4.0|He has a great voice. I heard one of his songs on a csi commercial so I bought the whole album.  I'm glad I did! I enjoy this album very much!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|When I read the book, I was running my first company for 1 year. I was working with a business angel that has more than 15 years in startup creation.<br />This business angel helped me to focus on the business, on the right stuffs to do. One day, he told me to attend a seminar given by Ash.<br /><br />This seminar really changed my live: for the first time, I understood the process in which I had been for the last 12 months.<br />I understood how I started my company and how I needed to develop it to go over the next challenges.<br /><br />I then read the entire book and I'm applying the tools and methods every day.<br />Thanks Ash!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I absolutely love this C.D. Duets 11. To be able to hear so any famous people singing with Tony Bennett gives one the opportunity to hear how they sing.  Since then I went and bought Amy Winehouse who I had never heard singing before.  I may go and buy Duets 1 also.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Title really says it all: this book is my first resource when brainstorming a new business idea, or a project of any sort, really.<br /><br />The notion of Lean is starting to permeate everything I do: \\"Where is the value?\\" \\"Who benefits and why?\\"  Simple questions with hard answers.<br /><br />If you like the strategy in Ries's \\"The Lean Startup,\\" the tactics in \\"Running Lean\\" will help you put it into practice.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Works fine on the HTC Rezound. For a free app works just as billed. Great for finding new music and sharing it with friends.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|While I'm usually sick and tired of the \\"evil cracker\\" type movies, this one was well made and had a good story line. Quite impressed with it. My family watched it with me and we all enjoyed it. My wife and daughter cried way too much for me though :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game.....honestly u can't lose but one thing i do not like.....the ads,they need to do away with them all together but if u handle the ads then u have a great game
B006W0QOF2|1.0|As usual, the previews made it look good. Turned out to be slooooooow, long drawn out movie with a horrible ending. I'm starting to think Hollywood doesn't know how to make a good film any longer. What a complete waste of time watching this. I want my 1.5 hours back...
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game! Very addicting! I really like how the achievements constantly change, keeps it interesting and challenging. Definitely recommend! Look forward to more updates. The only thing I'd like to see is an upgrade outfit that gives you quicker control of your squirrel.
B000031XBQ|5.0|In addition to the new Spanish lyrics/vocals, this album provides other new content as well.  Several of these songs feature enhanced or else all-new instrumentation.<br /><br />For example, La Reina Del Baile gives Dancing Queen a whole new sound, with electric piano taking the place of the more familiar grand piano.  The resulting sound is a more modern form of disco than the original version.<br /><br />Dame! Dame! Dame! is an interesting blend of original and new.  There are some additional vocal harmonies and acoustic guitar added to the mix.<br /><br />All in all, this album is filled with little treasures like these, which breathe new life into these famous songs.<br /><br />I'd like to correct what someone else posted here, about ABBA supposedly not speaking English.  Although ABBA performed their Spanish songs phonetically, they all spoke English throughout their career--as anyone who saw interviews of them on TV could attest!  Agnetha was engaged to a German record producer before ABBA, recorded in German, and spoke the language at a conversational level as well.  Frida spoke and recorded in French, and of course, learning languages was one of Bjorn's favorite hobbies.  So these Spanish-language songs are the only ones that ABBA recorded phonetically.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I was 12 when I walked into the den and saw a lavish wedding on TV. I asked my mom what movie was playing, and she said, \\"The Godfather.\\" I asked if I could watch. She warned me that it was violent and had sex in it, but I still wanted to watch it. That was the first time I watched an R - rated film, and the first time I was introduced to the wonder that is the The Godfather Saga.<br /><br />I got this DVD set for Christmas, and I have no complaints about the quality of the picture. Yes, it's very a very dark picture at times, but that only adds to the mood and beauty of the films. The commentary by Francis Ford Coppola is entertaining and informative, and even the deleted scenes are great. I haven't watched the documentaries yet, but I'm sure I'll enjoy those as well.<br /><br />Of course, there are naysayers who think that since it's not surround - sound and isn't crystal clear like today's movies that it's an inferior product. I disagree; this is a great print of the earlier films, and you don't need it to be up to the standards of, say, AVATAR, to be beautiful cinematography. Moreover, I don't need to be assaulted on all sides by gun blasts to appreciate the fact that a character is getting shot.<br /><br />In closing, I would like to say that my love of The Godfather Saga has only increased with watching this product, and I still feel the thrill I felt when I was a 12 year old young woman watching these movies for the first time.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|One of the challenges with reading any business-advice book is figuring out how to put it into effective non-trivial use. Ash's book is my favorite of all the Lean books because, while covering the conceptual stuff nicely, it always translates ideas down into examples that are messy enough to give you a sense of how to apply the same process in your own situation.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I first purchased this book on his website over a year ago. He follows Steve Blank, Eric Reis and Alex Osterwalder and the Lean Methodology -- and adds his own experience and insight.

0312641893|3.0|I really, really wanted to LOVE this book.<br />But, I did not.  It was just ok.<br />I wanted something new and exciting, but this felt very recycled and pieced together.<br />It read like a mash-up of Star Wars, Bladerunner, and Star Trek...<br />the android side kick...<br />the android harboring a secret... a royal secret, no less.<br />Evil alien Queen set on taking over the Earth...<br />A commoner, a mechanic (??? the name mechanic seems so archaic in this futuristic setting), ends up meeting the big deal Prince/ soon to be Emperor and he pursues her???<br />I never did quite understand why cyborgs are treated so poorly and shunned...<br />why?<br />Shouldn't they be superior?<br />The obvious Cinderella pieces were there... the evil Step-Mother, the two mean step-sisters...<br />no fairy godmother, a foot instead of a slipper...<br />that whole scene did not work for me...<br />it was eye-roll inducing...<br />really?<br />And the whole Luna... Lunar Queen...<br />I kept waiting for the story to really grab me and be original...<br />ALL the \\"professional\\" reviews make it sound so fabulous....<br />like the next GREAT thing...<br />I do not agree.<br />It is just ok.<br />When I reached the end I though, hmmmm, that's it?<br />Do I even want to read the next one?  Let alone, the next THREE.<br /><br />This is certainly NO \\"Hunger Games\\" or Harry Potter series...<br />lacks originality and is VERY predictable.<br /><br />Sorry!<br />I so wanted to love it!
0060594896|4.0|My son swears by this book. I think it is pretty good too! It is nice to see such a positive message.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is perhaps the best modern author. I was delighted when I learned he was writing another series of books because I completely enjoyed \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\"<br /><br />His research is always impeccable. Follett's writing is crisp, clean and completely uncluttered with details not needed to the understanding of the story he tells. It is this precise style of writing that makes his novels such a pleasure to read. His focus is marvelous. He never gets sidetracked from the story line and always makes the reader feel as if he or she is present as the events of the storyline unfold.<br /><br />I look forward to the next two volumes in this trilogy.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|i'll have to say that i'm slightly disappointed by it because it did not significantly enhance the audio output, granted the fact that it made my music louder. It is not a malfunctioning knock-off piece of junk. But it probably can't deliver what its price is meant for. its EQ settings are also mediocre. i've tried some of the SONY products and their output with their EQ settings can really turn your audio into something perfect instantly, although it wasn't a headphone amp. so i would only recommend this E6 if you are not picky at all. it does make sounds louder.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Great crime film. Gossling stars as the Brando anti-hero in what is essentially a remake of Shane (he even looks like Alan Ladd). A fascinating thinking man's caper. I would place this alongside such films as \\"Sexy Beast.\\" A+. Jim Thompson would have approved.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|This is one of the best tv series I've ever watched.  To achieve such a consistent level of suspense each season over 4 years is excellent. However, you should not buy season 4 without watching seasons 1 through 3 first or you'll never know what's going on. Well worth the money.
0756686970|5.0|My six-year-old son loves this book, which he received for his birthday.  He can pick out the characters from the sets he has and loves to look for and point out the sets he wants to get.  This book will definitely see some serious use. It's only been a month and I can already say that it was a great buy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just finished the 3rd book in this trilogy yesterday.  It took 2 days to read it, I could not put it down.  The emotion, action and intensity of the books are just captivating.  I feel these are probably now my favorite books of all time.  I borrowed the set from a friend to read and now will buy them for my own collection. The books have left a lasting impression on me and have stirred up some deep emotions.  A 'thank you' to the author for her amazing work.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|As always, Nickelback doesn't disappoint!  I just love their music!  Downloaded the entire album because I love all their stuff.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I got this through the free app of the day and it is great. I hopeless the second one goes free soon! highly recomended if you like Mahjong.
0307957837|5.0|I almost never read fantasy, as real life is fantastic enough. But this trilogy is capital-L Literature, and I was absorbed by every word; the days flew by as I read it. This is not exactly a children's book, though intelligent, questing teens will adore it. As a devout Secular Humanist the anti-Catholic and anti-religious elements didn't bother me at all. It's a good question to ask who the primary audience for the book is. I can only say that it seemed to be written for me. The super-devout should not give it to their children; they might grow up to be self-reliant, intelligently skeptical, unreceptive to dogma, and able to think rationally for themselves.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Launching a product is hard work. But for the uninitiated, and those of us like me who have a bit of experience but are still green at launching stuff, the hardest and most critical part is knowing WHAT to do, WHEN. This is the book to answer that question. It's a field manual for launching things (software in particular). There are others and some of them are great, but this one is special because of its down to earth practicality. This is grassroots, fundamental, and raw. It's awesome. Thanks Ash!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This does it all. Night mode is great for reading long pdf documents and the text reflow allows even large pages of text to ne read comfortably.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This movie came out around the time The Illusionist came out.  Had no desire to see it after seeing that other magic kind of movie.  However, this movie was on tv, I came into the middle of it and boom.. hook line and sinker! I couldnt stop watching it.  I bought the movie so I could see the whole thing.  Although I thought The Illusionist was a good movie, The Prestige offers so much more complexity to the story and overall was excellent.  I thought the cast was a perfect fit for all the characters!  Just a great movie!!!!
0316776963|2.0|Ok, to be fair, it really is a matter of just \\"I can't relate to this material\\".  The book is written as a series of autobiographical stories are disjointed and largely interesting.  I read the reviews about \\"laugh out loud\\" - I may have snickered in five places, but I didn't find anything that was worthy of laughing.  All I kept thinking is that I have waaaay better material for this kind of a memoir; but really, maybe he's funny to some.  Me...not so much.
B0025KW29U|5.0|I first saw this at a Serenity Now fundraiser, which is a showing of Serenity where the proceeds go to Equality Now, and they showed this as a bonus, and I fell in love.  I have always enjoyed Nathan Fillion, and Neil Patrick Harris, and after seeing this, I also fell in love with Felicia Day, and went out and purchased The Guild, which is Felicia Day's web series, which is also marvelous.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD rank among the most enjoyable, especially the clever \\"Commentary, the Musical.\\"<br /><br />I love the spirit in which this was created, and you can see how much the actors enjoyed themselves, which makes it just that much better.
0316098329|5.0|Holey Moley - that was INTENSE!  Here's another book that I would like to give a 4.5 stars - oh, half stars, where art thou?<br /><br />I would rate the first half of the book (pre-escape) as a 5 star, but then I think some of the momentum was lost so I would give the last half 4 stars.<br /><br />In the first half of the book, I found myself leaning forward, white-knuckling the book AND I couldn't get to sleep.  It's been a long, long time since a book has had me THAT hooked.<br /><br />When we first meet Jack, the 5-year old narrator, I was having trouble understanding his language (and I HAVE a 5-year old boy!)  But once you get the hang of reading this way, it's brilliant (and utterly heartbreaking). The author did a great job of creating dissonance in that on the one hand, the relationship between Jack and his Mom is beautiful, but on the other, the context of their relationship is horrific.  The tension between these two is woven throughout the story so at the end of the book - you still don't find resolution.<br /><br />Really, you just remain disturbed.  So, not a feel good story by any means, but totally engaging.

0156027321|5.0|***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />I can see why there is such a range in opinions regarding this book. Reading others' reviews, I see how much some people despise it while others are completely moved by it.  I fall into the latter group - for me, something resonated deeply.<br /><br />I could probably spend 227 days replying to other people's reviews, especially those that didn't enjoy it; but I think what it comes down to is that you have to read this book as a philosophical, spiritual, and/or religious journey.  It IS about religion; or perhaps, more accurately, God.  It says so in the Author's Note \\"Then the elderly man said, 'I have a story that will make you believe in God.'\\"<br /><br />So, if you are not prepared to examine this story as an allegory from that perspective, then I suppose you won't really enjoy the book.  If I was to speculate as to a couple of reasons why someone would NOT enjoy this book, I would say that Part 1 is slow-moving.  There is a really BIG set-up in this book and the set-up is extremely important in understanding the rest of the book.  In particular, descriptions of zoo life, including the temperament and care of the zoo animals is important; as is Pi's devotion to God and practice of three different religions (i.e., Hindu, Muslim, and Christianity).<br /><br />For anyone thinking of reading this book or who has started and is having trouble moving forward...be patient.  Every piece of information from these early chapters contributes to the understanding of Parts 2 and 3.  If you are a person that likes to skip over parts, or likes to skip to the end, seriously...don't bother picking up this book.  It's totally not for you.  This book is about the journey.  I've read reviews saying that Parts 1, 2 and 3 are disjointed - I couldn't disagree more; in fact, I would argue that they are three necessary parts to the whole.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Another reason I think some people would NOT like this book is the ambiguous ending. The story told in Part 2 is absolutely riveting.  Martel is a brilliant story-teller.  I could envision myself in Pi's shoes and followed with the ups and downs in his psyche as he experienced them being shipwrecked. It would have been a really great story if the end had been Pi's (and Richard Parker's) rescue.  In fact, I bet that for those that didn't like the book, they would have given a higher rating if it had ended like that.  (Just guessing).  But, instead Martel offers an alternative account of Pi's experience (stripped down and much more horrific).  The ending thus can leave the reader puzzled, frustrated, or perhaps even angry (based on reading others' reviews).<br /><br />Most people tend to like nice tight and neat endings after investing so much time, emotion, and energy to reading a book.  Martel's story leaves us hanging and allows the reader to choose the ending they believe.  I still get goosebumps reading the text that brings it all together (from Chapter 99, p. 317):<br /><br />\\"'So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?' Mr. Okamoto: 'That's an interesting question?' Mr. Chiba: 'The story with animals.' Mr. Okamoto: 'Yes. The story with animals is the better story.' Pi Patel: 'Thank you. And so it goes with God.'\\"<br /><br />Brilliant!!  This is the text that brings together all three parts of the book.  I love the way a few little sentences can pull together a whole story.  Love it!  This passage brings to mind the stories from the Old Testament, Daniel and the Lion's Den, Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, etc.  Those were some good stories, weren't they?<br />Ok, so at the end of the day, Martel's writing is superb, the story is absolutely riveting, and the ending is thought-provoking.  I can see myself reading this book in a few years with a fresh perspectiveand  re-interpreting the story.  It is THAT kind of book.and  re-interpreting the story.  It is THAT kind of book.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|having replaced my keyboard kindle twice sine Sept. 2010 (amazon customer service made this easy; thanks amazon!) due to faulty cases (one short circuited the kindle, the other was too soft with its memory foam and didn't ward against being dropped), this case is a godsend. gorgeous, fancy, easy to use, and i feel my kindle is FINALLY properly protected without having to get a bulky case. this fits the kindle keyboard well and the craftsmanship of the case is exceptional. Thank you Verso for making such an incredibly beautiful and useful case-- i hope you make cases for ipads and iphones soon so all of the electronics that i own can look like gorgeous, antique books while being fully protected from bumps, drops, and other mishaps.

B001LM1456|2.0|This film has a variety of scenes which are completely far-fetched and unrealistic. I can't believe that a human being could be capable of throwing tanks to-and-fro. I can't get into a movie which I can't believe in. Overall: C+.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|There's a lot of hype around the Lean movement right now, but I think this book warrants a special mention. The difference with Ash's book, is that he offers practical advice, and things you can actually begin implementing right now - and that's key for any would be entrepreneur. What can do I right now that is going to make a difference?<br /><br />I've also had the privilege of seeing Ash twice in workshops - he knows his stuff and has got tons of experience. This book is highly recommended!
B005H5H3LW|4.0|Very good adaption some plot changes that bothered me but It was presented more as a Re Dux than a true transfer of anime plot to real life actors in same roles all in all enjoyable movie

0394806220|5.0|My 4th and 5th class is reading Dr.seuss books. I enjoy Mr.Brown Can Moo!Can You because all the noises Mr.brown can do he could:moo, buzz, pop, klopp, clock-a-doodle-doo, hoo, dibble dopp, choo choo, whisper, blurp,s lurp,tick tock, knock,sizzle, grum, pip, boom, splatt, can you can do all the things that Mr.brown can do? I recommend this book to parents and teachers because they can use it to teach noises and sounds to their kids or students. Older kids can learn how to write better like if the teacher asks you to write descriptions about what you hear outside this book can give you ideas. All kids will enjoy these sounds.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|Ash Maurya's excellent book isn't just for startups - many of the lessons learned apply to any organisation that wants to behave in an agile and innovative manner. Having said that, the advice is particularly pertinent and practical for its intended startup audience who want to eliminate wasted effort and focus on building solutions that their target audience will want to buy and - having become users - will be keen to advocate.

1118156315|5.0|Business Model Generation has been useful for me as a business consultant because I could easily communicate the \\"story\\" of any business a client who might be considering changing or buying it. When the community was asked if we wanted to participate in a project to apply this tool to individuals, I readily agreed.<br /><br />I was expecting to be discussing the mechanics of things like defining Customer Segments for an individual as opposed to an organization. Yes we did that. Every organization has customers or they wouldn't exist. It's typical to start an organizational business model here. But people exist without customers, so where would we base an individual's model? Really interesting stuff; but not yet life changing.<br /><br />Then the development of Business Model YOU totally surprised me when it began to take a Spiritual (not Religious) turn. Something is Spiritual in my life if it has personal meaning to me. That meaning started to surface when we considered every Business Model to be a kind of blueprint; and agreed that every blueprint is created by an architect to achieve some purpose. To really architect a Business Model for your career, there needs to be some understanding to of your life's purpose.<br /><br />Suddenly finding, communicating, and creating attractive values for customers became simple compared to finding values that relate my career to my personal purpose. This is really hard work and Tim Clark, the book's author, never tried to dance around it. With surprising simplicity, he took us beyond the modeling world and into ways of looking at our careers as a fulfillment of our personal purposes.<br /><br />I then realized this is what my clients really wanted when looking at a business. The answer to their concerns was more in their Personal Business Model than in the organization's under consideration. My perception of who I am and why I do things has changed. I am no longer the same person.<br /><br />Funny, the Business Model YOU experience has changed my perspective on every organizational model as well. Having been through this work, you have an expanded intuition about changing the perspectives on all of the Business Model segments. You will never see personal careers or organizations the same way again. You will never be the same person either.<br /><br />Bob Fariss - co-creator Business Model YOU,  Fort Worth Texasience has changed my perspective on every organizational model as well.

B000006UNF|5.0|This album, more than and of the other Fish era albums, owes a tremendous debt to Peter Gabriel era Genesis.  I've been listening to Marillion since this album was released - I have the original vinyl.  I remember hearing \\"He Knows, You Know\\" for the first time on WNEW-FM and thinking to myself, \\"...this is 70's Genesis, how come I've never heard it before?\\"  I bought the album the very next day and have been listening to it regularly since. Much (though, not all) of this album does sound similar PG era Genesis - it was Fish's voice, his intonation, as well as the group's musical (though, most certainly *not* lyrical) style.  Of course, as the band matured, they developed their own distinct styles - from the harder edge on Fugazi to the neo-prog of Misplaced Childhood and Clutching at Straws.  It was a sad day when the band and Fish parted ways.<br /><br />The bonus disc is quite good, with the highlight being a re-recording of Grendel - the 17 minute B-side of their first single (actually, it could have been called an EP with the three songs clocking in at about 25 minutes).<br /><br />Script for a Jester's Tear was, and continues to be, one of my favorite albums ever and one that I still listen to regularly almost 30 years(!) later.  In my opinion, as good as their follow up albums were (and all of the Fish era Marillion albums are suberb), \\"Script\\" is far and away the best album the group has ever released.  A classic, indeed.

We also use it to give new ideas a thorough, but quick, vetting.  I imagine it would be great trying to inject a start up approach in larger organizations as well.

B004ZNAXX2|4.0|The Wall is one of the best concept albums of all time and it's impact has not waned over the many years from it's release in 1979. I absolutely love the album, it has helped me through some tough times in my life and holds a special place for me. But this box set is overpriced for what you get. The album is great, it has never sounded better, that is not an issue.<br />Is There Anybody Out There? is a fantastic glimpse into Pink Floyd as live band in the '80s and it's great to hear the entire album live with the original members. The live album also sounds fantastic, I have never owned this before so I don't know if it sounds better than before.<br />The demos were the main selling point for me, I had never heard any of these before and they really were very intriguing to hear the evolution of some of the songs. I liked the Roger Water's demos the most, they don't sound the best but they are very cool to hear how everything was already clearly mapped out in Water's head long before they ever went into the studio. My only complaint about the demos is that I wish they had included all of Roger's demos, but I understand that it would have been not the most entertaining thing to hear and it's probably for the best.<br />The DVD is a little underwhelming, but fairly enjoyable. Behind the Wall is very enjoyable and interesting, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 promotional video is boring and doesn't look very good, but the best part is the Earl's Court live clip. I hope that this clip is a teaser and that they will release the entire thing on blu-ray/DVD soon, the entire thing looked very good and had amazing picture quality although it is a little dark. I know of plenty of people that would pay good money to see that show in it's entirety, but we might have to settle for Roger Water's current tour instead.<br />The trinkets are just plain dumb and don't add anything to the album or this set. That does not include the books, the books are nice and I love them. The scarf is cheap and is basically falling apart at the seams, the coasters are cheap and flimsy, and the marbles are cheap and the bricks design rubs off if you play with them too rough or too much. The replica ticket is nice but unnecessary, I enjoy the Mark Fischer drawings, and the cards are fairly stupid as well since they don't offer insight or thoughts, just lyrics.<br />Overall, the main reason to buy this set is for the excellent new remasters and the demos in the best sounding incarnation on the market. But, this set could have been released for so much cheaper or they could have delayed it to include the 5.1 mix. I want to hear The Wall in 5.1, but I do not own an SACD player and probably never will. These Immersion sets are the only way that those of us without SACD can hear these albums in 5.1 in high quality audio, I highly doubt that EMI will release a stand alone blu-ray.<br /><br />There are a lot of things missing from this set and it's overpriced, but it does include a lot of worthwhile materials that Pink Floyd fans will enjoy. I enjoyed the majority of it and I will get many hours of listening from this set, but I can't help but feel that EMI has screwed the fans once again. I give the album and the music 5 stars, but the box only 3. So overall, 4 stars.is cheap and is basically falling apart at the seams, the coasters are cheap and flimsy, and the marbles are cheap and the bricks design rubs off if you play with them too rough or too much.

B0067Q04AM|4.0|This is perhaps the cheapest package I have ever seen for an artist of this stature and creativity. A junky jewel box with a flimsy black and white booklet.  Kudos to Blue Note for contributing to the death of the CD. What a disappointment for an otherwise great record.
B004BH0GUW|5.0|My wife had never seen this movie, and I saw it was pretty cheap for the BD on Amazon, so I bought it, and still enjoyed it. Reminds me of the good old days when Adam Sandler movies were funny.
B007BLDFWG|3.0|First: Elizabeth Olsen is incredible in the title role. Incredible.<br /><br />That being said, the movie was only okay for me. It started out good. The whole cult scene is amazing. Her running away. Calling her sister. Everything. But then, it just kept going on in the same vein. No growth or change for the characters. The biggest change is that the creepy brother-in-law (what was up with him getting all touchy feely on the boat, both times?)got creepier. The sister got a little bitchier. The main character didn't change much in the present parts of the story. You could definitely see her change from getting into the cult until present time. But in the present day portion of the story, not so much. And then there was an ending that was just too ambiguous. It was as if just as the story was starting to go somewhere, the credits started to roll and you're left sitting there going. . .huh?<br /><br />This isn't a hopeful movie. It's very bleak, which isn't bad, but I think you should be aware of it. There is no happy ending, or any real ending at all. You'll be left feeling like the main character is just going to go on forever like she is. Or maybe go backward. I'd love to see a sequel and know how she pulls herself out of her post traumatic stress. The acting and the pacing are awesome, the story needs some work.

B0051HNMTI|5.0|Great app. Makes it more entertaining, helps me have the discipline to do it. And notice low reviews have little if anything to do with the app.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|Bought this for my Kindle Fire to create a shopping list and calendar.  Shopping list works fine, but the calendar function leaves a lot to be desired.  There is only a small icon to show an appointment on a specific date - and you have to open the icon to see what it is.  Not what I hoped for.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|Where would this movie be without the Christian worldview? Nowhere. I have to admit I fall on the side of those that were captivated by this film. I am a Christian and see life through that end to be sure and I found this movie to be a frank telling of many of the things I have experienced and many of the things I believe. To begin to understand this movie is to try to understand the story as seen from God's perspective.<br /><br />First there is the picture of grace and \\"nature\\". I loved the picture of grace lived out in the mother. She is inquisitive, celebratory, gentle, lovely, free and loving; all the things that personify grace, all because it is in her nature to be that way. The father is \\"nature\\", which signifies human nature, and is unhappy, disappointed, angry, dull, harsh, enslaved, with occasional bouts of gentleness and love, all because it is in his nature to be that way. In the middle of the both of those things is God's sovereignty; in creation, birth, death, love, tragedy, happiness, calling; all of it. So ultimately I think the movie is from God's perspective; how He views creation and the dance or grace & nature. And who are we to question it (appropriate quote from Job)?<br /><br />This idea of God's sovereignty may not sit well with you. The idea of the Christian worldview may not sit well with you. The perceived nod to evolution may not sit with you. The long, impressionistic flow of the film may not sit well with you. The fact that Pitt and Penn are the stars may not sit well with you.<br /><br />If any of these are the case, here is your challenge. Put those things aside and plan to spend 2 hours to consider God, His sovereignty over human events, creation and the great dance of grace and nature (human nature). It will be 2 hours well spent.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|A well-done movie--especially good knowing that it was taken from a true story.  Good for both children and adults; dog lovers will like it.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Director Alexander Payne has previously directed movies such as the cult classic [[ASIN:B005DN7W78 Election]]n starring Reese Witherspoon, which I own, [[ASIN:B00005JLSK About Schmidt]] starring Jack Nicholson, and [[ASIN:B000I9YWWU Sideways]] starring Paul Giamatti, nominated for five Oscars winning one.<br /><br />Gregory Peck once said it's hard to make a good man look interesting.<br /><br />You can probably imagine in a cinematic world peopled with antiheroes, flawed heroes, or unrealistic superheroes, how refreshing it might be, to encounter a good guy we can relate to, in situations that parallel those we might actually experience.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer, businessman, and hardworking mostly absent father of two girls. He happens to be wealthy because of his descent from the original landowners of Hawaii, the real Hawaiians, who own most of Hawaii. Sole trustee of the family's interests, and now because of succession rules faced with the situation of having to sell off thousands of acres of pristine land to resort developers. Despite his family wealth Doug leads a very modest life. He drives a metallic silver Honda Civic, a sensible car.<br /><br />When his thrillseeking wife ends up in a coma following a powerboating accident, he is thrust into the unfamiliar role of looking after his two daughters each bringing their own challenges. The younger one has difficulties in school, the older one, well, she's a teenager.<br /><br />We learn early in the movie that the wife had an affair, making a difficult situation even worse. George Clooney Alex Payne manage to create apposite emotions for the movie goer. While distressed he pads out the front door, dons flipflops and runs to his wife's best friend house. He runs funny. A comic relief followed by a dramatic confrontation. Tension, and shock artfully modified by humor make this movie an emotional wonder.<br /><br />When he breaks the news of his wife's condition to his older daughter she ducks underwater and we see an invisible breakdown. Some of these scenes are tender. In the hospital there are various monologues to the comatose mother, from a cheated husband, an unforgiving daughter, and a wounded wife.<br /><br />The presence of Clooney vastly elevates the movie, as does the acting performance of Shailene Woodley, giving a tremendous breakthrough performance as the teenage daughter you worry might go off the rails. Judy Greer, who you probably know from Two and a Half Men appears later in the movie.<br /><br />The Descendants is among the leading Oscar nominated movies. Although nine movies are nominated for Best Picture, only three I believe are genuine contenders, The Artist, and Hugo being the other two. Nominations for The Descendants include Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />Previously, Alex Payne won the Academy Award for the Sideways screenplay.<br /><br />Based on [[ASIN:0812982959 The Descendants: A Novel (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)]] by Kaui Hart Hemmings.<br /><br />Now Payne has won his second Academy award for Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I think you will enjoy one of the years best movies, and I hope this was helpful.he ducks underwater and we see an invisible breakdown.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|seriously can't rate it highly enough... one of the most interesting and engaging science fiction / post apocalyptic books I've ever read.
B0071MV540|4.0|This was a fun movie, one I'd even watch again down the line.  My husband was laughing so hard that it was making me laugh.  If you are looking for something light, goofy and good for some laughs, this is a good one to watch.  Subtitles would have helped in a couple areas where the tower staff had a thick accent, but we managed to make out what was said without them.
B004DZUM88|2.0|Great special effects and an ingeneous story line make for a special movie watching experience. One of my favourite movies of all time. Very realistic and believable. Highly recommended for Sci-fi buffs.
1400069289|4.0|When I first picked up this book I made a joke about being in a pickle because I had a powerful habit of procrastinating reading books.  Once I finally did start reading this book, I had no problems with procrastinating reading more of it because it is honestly one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time.  It really opened my mind/eyes up to how manipulated we are by companies who want their products to become a habit of ours and also how deep in the brain habits are formed. It made me think of how much I do on auto pilot and why that is or why I fall back on old behaviors even when I am so sure in my head that I want to do it a different way.  I felt it could have delved a little deeper into the \\"how to change it\\" part, but you are definitely left with the tools needed to change your habits.  I've already started applying what I've learned and it's crazy how simple the concept is.  Maybe not simple to carry it out, but at least when I start to slip back into old routines, my brain can recognize that and know what I'm doing and I can stop myself.<br />A funny thing I noticed while reading this book was how many times I said to my spouse \\"Did you know that...\\" and went on to talk about something I'd read in the book.<br />I called it serious brain food because I felt charged up while reading it because I was taking in so much new and interesting information from it.  I think it's a book that can really change people's lives because you become aware of things you just didn't think about before.
B004ZQ74G8|5.0|Incredible story and feels like something that acutally happened.  I loved that it was written from the little boys point-of-view.  He's a brilliant character.  This is the genre I usually go for, but people of all interests an backgrounds will enjoy this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game. Great way to relax. I like the auto finish and that I can come back to the game it saves my previous score.
1449305172|5.0|As a finance guy turned entrepreneur, I've found the Lean Startup movement revolutionary.  The best thing to happen to entrepreneurship since the demise of indentured servitude!  Ash's 'Running Lean' is the single best, most valuable, usable resource I've found on the subject.<br /><br />I've spent the past 20 years as a student of business strategy and execution.  Since transitioning six years ago from investment management and venture capital to operational roles in technology startups, I knew something was fundamentally missing in startup thinking.  Lean Startup fills the massive gap between my MBA and corporate experience versus the very unique needs in launching and running a startup.  So I let my subscription to Harvard Business Review lapse and have given myself a new MBA in Lean Startup entrepreneurship the past two years.  In 'Running Lean', Ash brings it all together in a way that I've found incredibly valuable.<br /><br />In contrast, Eric Ries's book 'Lean Startup' is light and enjoyable reading that solidly introduces the subject.  This book is serious reading for the serious entrepreneur looking for applied and practical guidance on how to apply the incredibly powerful principles of Lean in their startup.  Make no mistake, it's work.  But if you're serious about launching a startup, 'Running Lean' is the single best guide I've encountered on the subject.
0545265355|5.0|I thought it was a box set of all the hungry game movies but it is just books. I guess I will put it on my shelf and people will think I can read or maybe I trade it for the movies to someone.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|1. The one page \\"lean canvas\\" is absolutely the best planning tool / idea you'll come across. Ash teaches you how to create a one page plan that kicks ass of all those MBA business plans with mission and vision statements and other fluff like that. And even though the lean canvas plan is 1 page only, it is very comprehensive. And actually, it is bloody hard to fill in - as it forces you to think.<br /><br />2. The concept of breaking down risk into 3 parts is epiphany inducing.<br />- Problem risk (is there a problem that needs solving?)<br />- Customer risk (is there demand? Are people willing and able to buy? How can you reach them?)<br />- Market risk (Competition? Will you be able to make a profit?)<br />Ash shows you how to prioritize and tackle each of these risks.<br /><br />3. Running Lean is a real \\"how to\\" book. Most business books are only about \\"what to do\\". They don't tell you how to do stuff.  Running Lean gives you step by step instructions. Ash also gives sample emails and transcripts he uses while dealing with people and validating your idea.<br /><br />4.  Running Lean is chokeful of real life case studies and very helpful graphics. There are quite a few good books out there that have a lot to teach, but because of their boring writing style, they fail to deliver their message. Running Lean thankfully is not one of them. Ash makes his point poignantly.<br /><br />5. Even the Appendix of Running Lean is full of awesome. I can't remember having read the appendix section of any book before. But I devoured the appendix of Running Lean:<br />- How to Build a Low-burn Startup!<br />- How to Achieve Flow in a Lean Startup!<br />- How to Set Pricing for a SaaS product!<br />- How to Get Started With Continuous Deployment!<br />- How to Build Your Conversion Dashboard!<br /><br />Running Lean will prevent you from making a lot of costly mistakes in business.  Read it now because it is one of the best \\"how to\\" business books out there.
B004NELBPC|1.0|I can not recommend thisapplication.  I would recommend removing or not downloading this app.  It is not worth your time.  Keep looking.
0062011847|5.0|Sir Terry served up a masterwork as usual with \\"Snuff\\".  The theme; prejudice and it's hydra headed prides of greed and fear.  Duke Vimes, Lady Sybil, Young Sam and assorted staff are vacationing in their country estates when a horrendous crime takes place and Sir Sam does what he does best; becomes just Sam of the Night Watch to catch villains no matter landed gentry or back water thug.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Great game and its very colorful I love playing this game<br />Only real problem is that they only give you 3 lives
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact you can log in and save your notes and highlights. this is a very easy app.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I completely loved it, my whole family has each taken turns playing it. I liked the fact the change of seasons makes it more complicated.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Excellent book with great examples and fantastic information. I will definitely be putting this method into practice very soon in my next meeting.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are overly simple. But all and all, I would say that it's worth the money....as long as it remains free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|For a free game, it's fun.  Some of the games are frustrating though.  I say everyone should try it. yes
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is ok.some games do not work.but for the most part the games are fun.you. should get this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. A fast read that I couldn't put down. Hope the movie will do justice to the book. Hunger Games comes out this month.
0316017922|4.0|Professional grade critics seem to have covered everything. Yeah, interesting and lacks the racism and classism that I fear from many people (coming from a white middle-class 21yo girl, as I speak out of fear of presumptions). Probably not very mathematically correct, though I don't know all the rules very well (not so good at statistics). Personally couldn't tell you about how much fact-checking he did.<br /><br />Pretty bland aside from interesting facts/arguments/whatever-to-call-them. Pretty much made up my mind in the course of reading that 'success' in my surrounding culture is asinine. Liked the book fine.
B001P59V5Y|5.0|I Love Monty Python and Life of Brian is one that now and then I love to watch again. It is an old movie but having it stashed in the Amazon Cloud gives me access whenever I want to re-watch it. It is irreverent, witty, just good fun. The Pythonisms are fun to hear again.
