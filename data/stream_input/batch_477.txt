B00062IVKI|4.0|Released in 1977, Martin Scorsese's NEW YORK, NEW YORK instantly divided critical response--and, facing box office competition from no less than STAR WARS, proved a major financial failure.  A significantly edited re-release followed not long afterward but proved even less well received and even less profitable.  Although a double VHS release eventually brought the film to the home market, the film remained unpopular and made barely a ripple in public consciousness.  In 2005, however, NEW YORK, NEW YORK received an unexpected release to DVD.  At long last it may begin to reach a significant audience.<br /><br />As a story, NEW YORK, NEW YORK draws from a number of oddly \\"Noir-ish\\" musicals made at Warner Bros. in the late 1940s.  Most particularly, according to Scorsese's commentary, it drew from MY DREAM IS YOURS, a film that not only starred Doris Day but actually reflected her life in its tale of a talented big band \\"girl singer\\" trapped in an abusive marriage with a musician.  Although the film force-fed the audience a happy ending, later films would not.  In the mid-1950s, Doris Day's LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME and Judy Garland's A STAR IS BORN offered stories of a gifted female vocalists locked into disastrous romances that played out to a very distinctly unhappy ending, and NEW YORK, NEW YORK draws from them as well.<br /><br />Scorsese not only repeats the basic stories and themes of these films, he also repeats the artificially heightened visual style typical of Hollywood films of the 1940s and 1950s--it is no accident that Liza Minnelli looks and sings remarkably like mother Judy Garland in this film--but he does so to an entirely unexpected end.  The bravado performing style of such films is completely snatched away, and the characters are presented in an almost documentary-like realism.  In theory, each aspect of the film would emphasize the other; in fact, however, this was precisely what critics and audiences disliked about the film when it debuted.  They considered it extremely grating.<br /><br />But perhaps the passage of time has opened our eyes on the point.  I saw NEW YORK, NEW YORK in its 1977 release and, music aside, I disliked it a great deal.  I expected to retain that opinion when I approached the DVD release, but I was greatly surprised.  It holds up remarkably well, and most of the time the balance of artifice and reality works very well.  But there are significant flaws.  In a general sense, the film has a cold feel to it that occasionally becomes so downright chilly you begin to detach from it.  But even more difficult is the character of Jimmy Doyle, the abusive husband of the piece.<br /><br />In his commentary, Scorsese notes that both he and actor Robert De Niro sought to push the character far beyond the extremes of MY DREAM IS YOURS, LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME, or A STAR IS BORN.  They were perhaps more successful than they expected.  The result is a character you actively do not want to watch or hear, and although we are eventually allowed to see beyond his annoying qualities that moment comes much too late in the film to make him acceptable in any significant way.  It makes for more than one bout of uphill viewing.<br /><br />Even those who didn't like the film in 1977 agreed that it looked good and the music was great, and although it isn't entirely ideal the DVD presentation is quite fine.  Scorsese's introduction and commentary are excellent; he is, however, augmented by film critic Carrie Rickey, and while her remarks are often interesting they are a shade to academic in tone for consistent interest.  The film has received a director's cut that restores the edits made for the second release as well as the \\"Happy Ending\\" number cut before the debut release, so the deleted scenes hold no great treasure; even so, they are interesting to watch.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the film--but it is very much a \\"Hollywood Insider\\" film that is probably best left to those who know a great deal about film history and who can recognize the numerous antecedents from which it draws.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerout film history and who can recognize the numerous antecedents from which it draws. <br /> <br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer <br />
B0000042MY|5.0|I saw the movie as part of a date with a fellow musician.  We were late to the cineplex and missed the original movie we'd wanted to see, so we saw the Last of the Mohicans instead.  It was a great movie (and an okay date), but it was the score the moved me most of all. <br /> <br />I was entranced through the whole thing. Loved Jones' parts of the score with the theme that ran through all the movements.  I bought this on cassette, and in that medium all his parts were conveniently on one side. <br /> <br />I have an extensive music collection with both cassettes and CDs with very few items doubling between the two.  This is one of the few that I have in multiple formats because I enjoyed it that much. <br /> <br />One of my favorite movements of all orchestral music of all time is \\"Top of the World.\\"  The music advisor I had at the time, a very prolific composer, had a snobbish attitude toward film scoring.  I brought \\"Top of the World\\" for him to hear, and he actually admitted liking that one when he generally doesn't like film music. <br /> <br />My only complaint if I have one at all is that the Clannad song \\"I Will Find You\\" is too short on the soundtrack.  I distinctly remember it being much longer in the film itself.  That is the version I would rather hear than something that is over much too soon.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Up until I saw this film, I knew very little about Christian Bale.  My wife told me that he was in a version of \\"Little Women\\" sometime ago.  I've also seen him with smaller parts in other films.<br /><br />In \\"Equilibrium,\\" Bale takes center stage as John Preston, a top cleric in Libria who hunts down \\"sense offenders.\\"  These \\"sense offenders\\" range from people who read poetry and novels, study art, or enjoy the occasional musical piece.  In other words, anyone who shows any sort of emotion is dealt with swiftly and deadly.  Also, if you skip your dosage of Prozium, an emotion dulling drug, you risk facing death.<br /><br />All of this emotion control is done in hopes to render any ideas of revolution moot.  After the third World War, balance is brought about by removing art, music, etc. so that no one gets any crazy ideas.  Of course, there are some folks who want to feel.  These people, including one fellow cleric, manage to get under the skin of Bale.  Bale slowly begins to lose his emotionless nature and begins to cherish things such as rainbows and puppies.  He begins to care for human life and worries for the safety of his children.  Eventually, he is recruited by the revolutionaries to lead their revolt on \\"Father,\\" a Big Brother-type who controls what is considered good and what is considered bad.<br /><br />Bale goes from emotionless puppet to a vengeful, angry man.  Though some may find his love of a puppy and the lengths he goes to in order to save its life a tad silly, you have to see the situation through his character's eyes.  The best example I can give is when you see a deaf person \\"hear\\" for the first time using a hearing aid.  They usually begin to cry tears of joy and pain all at the same time.  Something very similar occurs to Bale when he hears music for the first time.<br /><br />Taye Diggs provides a smarty-pants foe to Bale's Preston.  Angus McFadyen plays \\"Father\\" with sinister flair.  Both Emily Watson and Sean Bean have small but significant roles and they put their whole hearts into their respective characters.  The rest of the cast is very good, though most of them are simply \\"sweepers\\" and revolutionaries who fight violently and often.<br /><br />The story moves at a steady pace and really picks up when Bale begins to show a little too much emotion around Diggs.  The action is brilliant, especially the gun-kata.  Others have compared this film to \\"The Matrix,\\" but I see nothing in \\"Equilibrium\\" that wasn't copied by \\"The Matrix\\" and vice versa.  Let's be honest folks, the whole \\"Matrix\\" story and things not being as they seem has been thrown around for centuries.  It's all been done before in countless books, plays and films.  What it all boils down to is good versus evil and in the end, good prevails.  Stop with the comparisons already!<br /><br />Anyway, watch this film if you really enjoy action-packed sci-fi that is a little bit more intelligent than most of the shoot-em-up sci-fi we are treated to these days.  The acting is way better than a lot of other flicks out there these days.  The action is fun to watch, and you will actually pull for the good guys in this one.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ut significant roles and they put their whole hearts into their respective characters.

B0007MVXQG|4.0|First of all, I cannot say much more than other reviewers regarding the musical aspects of this disc.  Very well - performed, decent songwriting and the classic Priest sound.  Very solid album start to finish.  However, the decision to compress both audio and dvd mediums onto one disc may be a mistake.  While the audio side has played fine so far it is diffcult (in a dark vehicle or bedroom) to figure which side is the DVD side and which side is the audio side.  This can be a pain in the booty if your car stereo is atempting to read a DVD...needless to say it will try for about a minute or two before it spits it out...sucks.  Also is regrds to the dvd portion of the single disc...while the DVD side is full of great concert shots and interviews, it is almost impossible to watch due to skips in the video (yes I have a higher quality DVD player).  These skips occurred about halfway through the dvd.  The disc was clean, I suppose it could be a disc error but while it may be more convenient to have both mediums on one disc it sucks that plays the way it does.....anyone else having this problem?
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Okay, you have plenty of other plot rundowns available to you, so here's just my opinion.  SotD is very good.  It's funny, it's scary, and it's tightly woven.    What that last one means is that it has several self-references that you don't notice until you've watched it a few times.  It also refers to other zombie movies.  In the scene selection menu, one of the scenes is called \\"Residential Evil\\".  This is my favorite part of the movie, where Shaun walks from home to the store and back, NOT NOTICING the zombies around him!  The scene is funny and creepy at the same time.    Other references are to 28 Days Later (at the end of the movie) and, of course, Night of the Living Dead.  Use the Zomb-o-Meter if you know even less about zombie horror than I do.    The zombie theme is a running gag throughout the movie.  Many of the background characters look like zombies before the zombie plague reaches them!  An important moment is when Shaun removes his job nametag, thus rejecting literal and social zombification.    Pay attention to Ed, who represents Shaun's apathy.  As Shaun becomes more dynamic, Ed progresses from mere deadweight and becomes actively obstructive.    My only criticism of SotD is that David is presented one-dimensionally.  He shows no real motivation beyond opposing Shaun.    There is swearing, and one character gets his guts ripped out, but overall Shaun of the Dead is a good movie.  It's funny, scary, intelligent, well-paced, and well-acted.
B00004U2G1|2.0|...This had the SACD logo sticker on the cover and the way the logo is designed, implied that this was in 5:1.  Shame on you.  It is in stereo.  I have always enjoyed this album that came out when I was in high school and have a stereo copy already.  When I saw it in the SACD section of Best Buy, I thought it would be the livin end to have it in surround sound!  It was a severe disappointment to see that it says Stereo in small letters on the back after I had opened it already.  If I hadn't opened it, I would have returned it.  Why bother putting out a SACD if it is only in stereo???
0767834739|3.0|I did like RE:A, but I found it a disappointment because the movie makes it too clear that the main characters are going to survive.  It takes all the suspense out of the climactic fight scene when you already know Alice is going to make it! <br /> <br />The most egregious example of this is the first time Alice and Nemesis fight.  Alice escapes down a garbage chute and Nemesis launches a rocket after her.  It goes off three feet from her butt and her only cover is a wheeled gargage bin.  Alice not only survives, she's unharmed! <br /> <br />Another example:  The deus ex mechanica when they rescue Angela.  Jill's exploding-stove trick doesn't work, but Alice just HAPPENS to have a lit cigarette, she HAPPENS to understand what Jill's plan is, and she HAPPENS to be in just the right place to toss her cig exactly where needed. <br /> <br />I could go on, but I don't actually want to run the movie down.  RE:A is pretty good, but it could have been so much better.
B000002LEU|4.0|<br />Do you ever wonder where it all began?  Where the inspiration for today's rejuvination of 80's goth and pop came from?  You know, Interpol, the Killers, etc... <br /> <br />Pick up this album and give it a spin.  Ian Curtis who took his own life was one of the more heartfelt and tortured artists who could give Morrissey a run for his money.  The band (which later became New Order) had all of the elements of a post-punk pre-80's pop orchestration that can never be repeated. <br /> <br />Peter Hook's base lines and the jarring melodies which echo rebellion, and confusion from the emerging new electronic age of the early 80's are captured in a timeless classic.  From the album's punk beginnings \\"3 5 ...\\" to songs which lay the foundation for some of New Order's classics this album has it all. <br /> <br />Radio Live Transmission...a eerie song which calls on all to \\"dance, dance, dance...to the radio\\" starts slow and ends in classic New Order esq fashion. <br /> <br />Dead Souls (which was later covered by a well known 90's legend) is a fantastically eerie song with its subtle keyboards and baselines, and of course the narration of Ian Curtis. <br /> <br />Pick it up, enjoy and remember where the current trend in modern music began. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Whether by it's excellent musicianship, masterful storytelling, or just sheer power of it all, Frances The Mute is a classic album worthy of following up De-loused. <br /> <br />While MV's first album was controlled and split into respective songs, Frances The Mute runs wild, letting the band's creativity run wild into places unknown, unexplored, and technically unexplainable.  Songs that last 30 minutes long, blending into each other and telling a masterful story. <br /> <br />I give the band props for releasing such a... different album under a major label, as it is not mainstream material and it will either be loathed or loved.  The journey of the story is a dramatic and confusing one, and it is not even over.  The title track \\"Frances The Mute\\" is not even on the album, due to certain song lengths.  It is on the Widow single. <br /> <br />This album shows many different styles, from pure rock, to jazz, to... salsa?  Yes, it's all in there, with Volta's standard blend of Spanish and English (incidentally, the movement names in the album are in another language entirely, Latin) and solos that wouldn't be unheard of in the 70's.  This album is a throwback to rock in its prime, and is proof that the heart of rock is still beating quite well (although it experienced an aneurism with the track Cassandra Gemini). <br /> <br />The album guest stars... Flea on the trumpet?  Yes, it's true, and done masterfully by the way. <br /> <br />What more can I say, words cannot describe the album, only by listening in to the Volta will you be able to understand.  Any rock fan would benefit from buying this album.

B00028HBKM|4.0|This movie has some scenes that are violent (nothing that hasn't already been show in other movies before), but it's not gratuitous violence. The violence depicted in this movie has the objective to emphasize the contrast between the atrocities that Christ suffered and the power of forgiveness and love that never fails him.  Whether you are a Christian or not, the fact is that for Christians (and therefore in the context of this movie) Christ is the son of God. So, we have to understand that the violence against Christ is even more shocking because he was suppose to be adored and revered. Instead, this person - that should be revered -  was despised,  humiliated, tortured and finally crucified. In this day and age Christ would be considered a \\"loser\\": he was poor, hated, disregarded. Despite all these things, Christ accepted his destiny and forgave his enemies by the power of Love. That's the core message of the Passion and it can only be fully understand if we realize the ordeal that he went through and that's the purpose of the violence shown in the movie. That's why this movie may have a strong impact in some people, specially believers: they may realize for the first time the amount of punishment that the Son of God suffered, and that he did it for us. <br /> <br />I rated this movie 4 stars because I would like to have seen more flashbacks about Christ's life during the \\"Via Dolorosa\\". I think that that could have been better explored. Anyway, kudos to Mel Gibson for having done an exceptional movie, even going against Hollywood (that revenged by not nominating the movie for any Oscar). <br /> <br />To end this little review I'd just like to mention that the Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern who plays Virgin Mary is Jew and she is also a daughter of a Holocaust survivor.  If she had seen any trace of anti-Semitism in the movie I'm sure she wouldn't have taken part in it.
B0000019PA|5.0|i'm sorry, but this album is a work of genius, and if you think it's stupid, or that bands DIRECTLY INSPIRED by it like the Decemberists, are better, then you're an idiot and your opinion of music should be discounted for people who can appreciate original and heartbreaking lyrics that go beyond fred durst's delinquent whinings. if you're not significantly moved by the album's final track, \\"the two headed boy part 2,\\" then you either have no emotion, nor a brain, or maybe neither. also, for people who don't \\"get\\" lo-fi music, stop writing reviews. you're just wasting serious music fans' times. it's like writing a review of nabokov's \\"lolita\\" saying it sucks because it has \\"too many big words\\" and it's \\"hard to read.\\" idiots.
0316172324|3.0|I enjoyed reading Blink, but don't think it needs your immediate attention. <br /> <br />This is a book about judgments, snap/subconscious decisions, and what we can do to trust them or try to change them. <br /> <br />I think that Blink flowed really well and had some good arguments, but I don't think there is anything new here.  Nothing in this book is spectacular.   <br /> <br />Putting all of the examples together and analyzing them does have some interest, but there is nothing striking about Gladwell's arguments. <br /> <br />I think that the idea behind this book is very important, but needs more work.
B00006I53S|5.0|This is a phenomenal walk-around lens when used on my 300D (and presumably, any other body with a crop factor of 1.6). This, of course, brings the range up to a usable 46-216mm lens, which, granted, chops off the wide end of things, however down to 28mm is covered by the kit lens... At any rate, this lens has an incredibly usable range for a great price. Visual qualties seem to be excellent (I have no \\"scientific\\" tests to verify this), and the image stabilization really is a useful inclusion. Like everyone else already said, it will NOT make up for poor technique, or compensate for a moving subject. Same rules still apply: brace yourself, exhale then shoot, etc. max aperature of 3.5 is still a max aperature of 3.5, so your light gathering is useable, but not blazing fast. Buy a flash and a canon 50mm for indoors and low-light. This is THE lens for the discerning buyer.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|This album is mediocre... I don't see myself listening to it very much in the future. The old album was much better because it had actual music on it while this one... doesn't. <br />But hey if you want long drawn out periods of build up (like 3 minutes or so in each song) or if you'd like a bunch of artistic noises (another 3 minutes in each song)... \\"Hey wait... that leaves hardly any music at all in the album... That is like half of every song! Wtf!\\" Yeah thats what you will be saying when you realize you just payed money for some fool to hit random keys on his electric keyboard.  <br /> <br />Well if you ARE a mars volta fan then buy this album (but expect to be dissapointed)-- otherwise don't give it the time of day unless you are majoring in art. <br /> <br />My suggestion is to go out and buy a Blood Brothers album instead of this. Preferably \\"Burn Piano Island Burn\\" or \\"Crimes.\\" Seriously-- they are like 100x better than The Mars Volta.

It is a rare look inside the business of baseball, but even more, a look inside the mind of a true independent thinker (Billy Beane). The book is extremely well written and well researched and an all around great read.
B00005O5JV|4.0|This is a charming and fun movie. Reese Witherspoon carries the entire movie. She is very charismatic, intelligent, likeable and potentially a very good lawyer. The film was better than I thought it would be - that is always a good sign. Of course, Elle is stunningly beautiful with a wonderful quick mind. However, don't watch the sequel as the film has stretched reality about as far as it can be stretched without breaking the charm.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Brilliant. That's only one of the hundreds of positive things you can say about Radiohead's third album, OK Computer. It features an obscure, distorted, blurred, wild vision into what rock n' roll is supposedly becoming. Yorke is a genius. Each song flows together as smooth as can be, featuring the seemingly simple, yet captivating guitar melodies. Suggested as a depiction of the downfall of rock, Radiohead explored an entirely different outlook on rock n' roll compared to their previous studio albums. It is phenomenal. From the light, almost fluorescent sounding harmony of Exit Music to the bottled up, yet powerful melody of climbing up the walls, this album has everything you could want. I don't care if you dislike their style and music, but every music lover should believe in the talent of this extraordinary band. I'm not as much into their newer stuff, as it is even too obscure for me, but what they'rev achieving now is still incredible.<br /><br />Best Songs(they're all well done):<br /><br />Paranoid Android: A remarkable 6 minute track, highlighted by the outstanding lyrical quality of the song as well as the guitar melody.<br /><br />Electioneering: A fantastic achievement. One of the heaviest off the album, I adore the guitar.<br /><br />Airbag: A perfect intro into the album giving us somewhat of a sense of what's to come.<br /><br />No Surprises: A true Radiohead song. Even more impressive when it's performed live.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a true work of art. It belongs in any Radiohead fans' collection and I think that the people who are into all the dumb rock we hear today should also listen to this album.

I'm a fan of rap music.  I don't like what he's using it for and producing from it.

To all of those that know how to write a review thanks. To those of you that told me that Mr. Harvey does not get punished for his crimes ( and other parts of the ending which would be the point of someone wanting to read it) no thanks.

0066620996|5.0|Some people have commented that the concepts in this book are elementary and have implied that the act of articulating them is insulting to readers' intelligence. By that logic, we should see many more great organizations than we currently do. If the practices outlined in this book are so easy--as some have said--then why aren't more organizations actually implementing them and seeing the success of the \\"good to great\\" companies?  <br />Because either we don't really believe that they're true, or we lack the courage to implement them, that's why. Because we need empirical evidence--offered brilliantly by Collins and his team in this book--to convince us otherwise. We'd rather believe that an outside, charistmatic CEO is the answer to all our problems. We'd rather believe that we can say \\"yes\\" to any business opportunity to come down the pike than have the discipline to say \\"no\\" to the good, which is the enemy of the great. Because we'd rather blame outside circumstances for our problems than face the ugly truth that we have met the enemy and he is us. <br /> <br /> <br />
0140288503|5.0|Reading BLACK HAWK DOWN made me angry at the entrenched, bureaucratic, and unimaginative cadre of men and women who make up the command structure of the United States military.<br /><br />This is journalist Mark Bowden's masterfully written, incredibly gripping, amazingly detailed, and purportedly scrupulously accurate account of a joint Ranger-Delta Force \\"snatch and grab\\" operation conducted against Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid in Mogadishu on October 3-4 1993. Just like Steven Crane who wrote THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE Bowden has never been to war, but but he has nonetheless managed to capture the essentials of war between the covers of this book.<br /><br />It is important to remember that despite the terrible scenes of American soldiers' corpses being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu the raid itself was a success in that it bagged Aidid's top lieutenants. It is also important to remember that although the Americans were vastly outnumbered in this, their longest sustained firefight since Vietnam, they were able to drive back their attackers while inflicting very heavy losses on them.<br /><br />There was (and is) a tendency to blame President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Defense Les Aspin for the consequences of the raid, but as BLACK HAWK DOWN illustrates, the Mogadishu raid was the offspring of poor, overly predictable planning by certain field commanders, insufficient training, lousy intelligence, and an overreliance on technology that has caused the quality of the American fighting man to deteriorate over many years.<br /><br />The debacle of BLACK HAWK DOWN was not the fault of the Clinton Administration, it was the fault of a fossilized military culture which promotes officers more interested in what church a man attends than in keeping that man in top fighting trim. An officer who relies exclusively on using football idioms to describe battle plans is a man who lacks thinking skills and should be commanding a small desk not a regiment. An officer who distinguishes between Ranger wounded and Delta Force wounded in battle should be dishonorably discharged.<br /><br />The Americans were in Mogadishu (described by its unlovely but accurate moniker, \\"Mog\\") as part of a UN Peacekeeping force which ultimately became a player in Somalia's horrible civil war, a war in which a petty clan chief like Aidid was able to use mass famine as a weapon. Aidid no doubt deserved to be killed (and eventually was, by a rival clan).<br /><br />Mog itself is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hell of sand-choked streets and rag hovels, a city with light fixtures but without electricity, with pipes but without running water, with thousands of telephone poles leaning akimbo but without working telephones, a city ultimately without hope. Its one million inhabitants are divided by tribal rivalries and unified only by two elements: Misery and Islam.<br /><br />The clan chiefs are able to use both elements to attack the American forces when they come for Aidid on that hot October day. How so many hundreds of destitute Somalis managed to stockpile such an array of weapons and ammunition just points up the brutishness of their leadership and their lives.<br /><br />As the Americans are airdropped into Aidid's stronghold, the shooting starts and it does not let up. Two nearly-invincible Black Hawk helicopters are shot down and two are badly damaged by small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades. Their crews are wounded, captured, or killed. Inexcusable communications breakdowns and the sheer intensity of the Somalis' assault makes exfiltration of the Ranger/Delta attack force an immediate impossibility. They are forced to fight continuously until dawn.<br /><br />Perhaps it is Bowden's light and breezy novelistic tone, but his description of men \\"freaking out\\" when one of their number is killed is not reassuring; neither is the fact that routine training is considered \\"totally cool\\"; neither is the depiction of constant boredom-fueled Stratego tournaments. The \\"Hoo-ah\\" esprit de corps of the Rangers comes across as the bravado of preadolescent boy soldiers who practically hero-worship the irreverent Delta Force \\"D-boys\\" who disdain the normal military. If this is the mental state and readiness of the supposedly elite forces, the Regular Army must be a preschool.<br /><br />The shock of the men as they watch the \\"Skinnies\\" shoot down the terrifying Black Hawks and launch hopeless, bloody frontal assaults on their far better armed and led adversaries is palpable, but much to their credit most of the Rangers and Deltas rise above their fears and fight dynamically for each other in this pointless, unnecessary and bloody battle.<br /><br />Eighteen Americans died and one was captured. The incident led to the removal of U.S. troops from Somalia, a long-range strategic blunder that taught rogue leaders that while America could hit hard it couldn't take a punch, a lesson plan which reached its logial end on September 11, 2001. Reading BLACK HAWK DOWN gave me an insight into the U.S.'s current Iraq strategy: Not to give up the field under pressure. Hopefully, the military leaders who so heartily endorsed the book learned some other lessons about leadership as well.onstant boredom-fueled Stratego tournaments.

B00005QXXO|4.0|This live album release of Radioheads songs from their european Kid A/ Amnesiac tour, is first off, not a must own. It's cut too short at only 40 minutes and several of the songs sound only mediocre live: Ideoteque and The National Anthem are the one's I'm thinking. The National Anthem is the opener actually, so it's too bad that it has to be one of the weaker songs on the album; I was expecting an all-out jazz-rock jam like it was on the album, but it's only around five minutes long here, and the lack of horns is greatly missed. The album does pick up after that, though- a straightforward rock version of \\"I Might be Wrong,\\" a greatly improved \\"Morning Bell,\\" and, as the song that they unexpectedly do turn into an all out jam, \\"Everything in its right Place- are all improvements over their album versions. The acoustic closer \\"True Love Waits\\" is also a real gem, the clearest, most emotional lyrics Thom Yorke ever wrote, sung in his clearest vocal on the album (even on the better songs he can sound irritatingly unintelligable. These songs make it an interesting listen for hardcore radiohead fans, but certainly not for the uninitiated, or the lighter fans. <br />HOWEVER: I have saved by far the best song on this album for it's own special section, which is \\"Like Spinning Plates.\\" I challenge anybody to find a song in any form of music from any time period more haunting, precise and beautifully played than the piano-strings and voice version done here. This song, with its chilling lyrics about a genocide and/or ethnic cleansing and Thom's vocal which shifts from strangulated to weeping, is a vast improvement over the annoying album version and is the only song on this album I truly would say is essential listening for Radioheads' diehard fans, lighter fans and the uninitiated alike.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I'll admit right off the bat, I'm a new fan of the band, but when i heard warning I was pleasently suprised, Its not nearly as upbeat or angry as warning, but has inspirational lyrics and awesome mixes of acoustic and electric guitar chords.  I love Misery, my favorite song on the album, unlike punk operah, \\"American Idiot,\\" it tells short skimpy stories about a couple of people who got some serious problems, complemented by great vocals and a beat you can't help but tap your feet to.  Its amazing that there's still a rock band out there that has a care for quality, and Music Theory, you can tell there not in it for the money.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Christopher Lee is Dracula, cool and wolf-like, bearing his razor-sharp canines as he mesmerizes the ladies! Peter Cushing is Van Helsing, the expert nosferatu-hunter, bent on Dracula's total annihilation. Together, they are the negative / positive poles of this gothic tale of bloodletting and possession by Hammer studios. The screenplay turns the original Stoker novel inside-out with excellent results. I had expected to hate it, but ended up enjoying HORROR OF DRACULA more than most vampire epics. Michael Gough (Batman, Sleepy Hollow) is perfect as the suspicious husband of Mina and brother of Lucy, who both succumb to the Count's alluring gaze and sinister bite. Can he help Van Helsing to destroy Dracula before he destroys them? Watch and see! Highly recommended...
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Without out a doubt an amazing album. If you like anysort of punk or rock or anything thats half decent you have to buy this record. This is one of my favourite records and one of the most catchy and creative. Its amazing pop music, thats very stylish and simply divine. You cant relly compare them to other bands but if the most relavent would have to be Josef K, Belle and Sebastian and recently   Bloc Party (who franz had a hand in getting exposure). Franz are one of the best bands of the past 5 years and are the cuolmination of every single band NME ever liked. Just get it!
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Good special effects but tiresome and boring.  If you are a Brad Pitt fan, then by all means ladies, watch this movie.  Guys, this means you get a night out!!
B0007O38F8|5.0|Yes I actually own the cd unlike 80% of you idiots who reviewed this so far, and Yes this is a 5 star cd.  Now I HATE 50 as a person, but his music is good, you can't deny it, what's the excuse for you haters on this one, his topic range is great, going from god,(God gave me style) to the usual hood life(I'm supposed to die tonight), to girls(Build you up),to his beefs with people(Piggy bank), to life situations(Baltimore love thing).  The beats are hot, the lyrics are great.  You can hate the person, I hate 50 as a person, but you can't deny that his music is great. So go ahead and hate him, but unless you have actually heard this cd, or you have a good/true reason why this cd is bad then don't talk crap about his music.
B000069CWE|4.0|This CD is not the best remix version I have heard, for example in my opinion the reinterpretations of several songs such as Points of Authority, High Voltage and By Myself are lacking what the original versions had and that is flair and brilliance. What saves this CD is the input and sometimes successful combining of guest vocals and bands like Aaron Lewis from Staind who goes well with Mike Shinoda's voice.<br /><br />Overall this CD has 20 tracks with most songs in the 3 minute range and not that long per say. This Remixed album won't be for every fan however I enjoyed the majority of the remixes as they showed that Linkin Park was at work on creating more great music that soon came out in their latest album 'Meteora'.<br /><br />Look out for the last track, it is one of the best tracks. A good close for a strong CD.
B0007TKH66|5.0|As a 44 year old, I have been a Trekkie( not ashamed to use that term either) since the original series...the holy grail of Star Trek. And like many, I was VERY skeptical about new shows trying to pretend to be Star Trek. But, THANK GOODNESS I saw the light. I loved STTNG, DS9 and Voyager....but I was even more skeptical about a show that went back BEFORE the Original series. But, I watched and I was blown away. I didn't know what they would do without shields and holodecks, but oh boy the frontier was wide open for exploration and invention...and this excellent crew has done it. We see them making a mess of first contacts and the beginings of the evolution of the Federation and Star Fleet. It is a travesty that the show is not allowed to go the full 7 years. I don't want to hear any malarkey about ratings...Voyager is arguably the weakest of all Trek shows and it managed to hold on and Enterprise blows it out of the water. Anyway, I cannot wait to relieve the show again on DVD.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said by most other reviewers?  I was waiting for this album to happen for a very long time and I am happy to say that it doesn't disappoint.  I made myself wait a few days before writing this review to allow for repeated listening.  I wanted to let the hype wear off a bit and make sure my opinion didn't change.  As it turns out, the more I listen to this the better it sounds.  There is something here for every Priest fan from just about every era of the band.  I especially enjoy the variety on this album; from Eulogy, which sounds like a little interlude off of Sad Wings of Destiny, to Judas Rising which would not sound out of place on Painkiller.  The small minority of fans who thought the Ripper Owens period was groundbreaking may think that this is a step backwards. <br /> <br />This isn't Judas Priest's best album by any measure, but it sure is a breath of fresh air from a band that just wasn't relevant without Rob Halford.  I have to give it 5 starts for meeting my lofty expectations.  The addition of the DVD pushes this release over the top (what a great value for the price).  The interviews are nice but the live footage really shows that these guys can still put on a great show.  In my opinion, this is the best comeback since Iron Maiden's Brave New World.  I think the albums are similar in that they don't strike out into new territory but they do a nice job of covering the sound from past eras of the band.  A wise move for a reunion album as there are no unpleasant surprises (remember the Generation Swine debacle ala Motely Crue). <br /> <br />P.S.  If you like this album, do yourself a favor and check out the Halford albums.  You won't be disappointed.   <br />
0670033375|5.0|This is the work of a pulitzer prize winning academic who has written an accessible book for the intellectually curious that combines aspects of history and science to invent a mechansim for cultrual reflection. It is not definitive, but it is an excellent introduction to a new level of collective self-discovery all societies can bennefit from. It is an especially valuable exploration of vital considerations of viability for a society like ours in which corporations and special interests play  a pivotal role in shaping our economy, lifestyle, and political life --not to mention informing our ability to respond and adapt to change. People predisposed to reflection on the cause for our present day realities, who are willing to ponder potential perils in our collective choices, or are optimistic that the past can shed insight into our futures in the hopes of advancing the human condition, will enjoy this author's works.     This is not a work for conservative ideologues who are threatened by the idea that we can shape our future to improve upon the status quo. Perhaps due to the implications for personal aspirations or out of blind esteem for wealth, such folks clearly find the  idea that our society should reflect on its future in this manner to be threatening and will tend to react viscerally. Ironically, it is exactly when such a state of mind takes hold among the collective that the choice to fail is made . Buy it, borrow it, but  read it.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Personally, I've only seen the Japanise version for I own an import, but this is defentilly my favorite ghibli film. It has a great storyline, wonderful charactors, great graphics for an 80's film, and a BEAUTIFUL score (I want the soundtrack). This anime is one you want to see more than once (beleive me I watch it all the time). So if you see this movie domestic or import it doesn't matter GET IT!
B0007O38F8|3.0|Me and my homeboyz downloaded this cd in computer class for free expecting it to be a hot ass cd. It's straight and you can tell it's a commercial cd because it'ss two hotest songz are disco inferno and candy shop the rest of the album is okay piggy bank was not one of the best diss songs i've ever heard but it's sill good and Gatman and Robin is a funny track to me but there's no need for it. What i don't get is how u can speed two years on a cd then brag about it than it doesn't be that good
B0007O38F8|4.0|I gotta admit, some tracks are really good. 'Lust A lil Bit' 'Get in  My Car' and all the other favorites candy shop, disco, etc etc. Most people are complainig that this CD is not all that hot and sh*t. Its not supposed to be really. Its called the Massacre, [The Valentine Massace, really] its got a lot more soul, look at 'God Gave Me Style' and 'So Amazing.' Its a differnet side of 50. I do admit the gun shots get tired after the first song [intro actually], but that's his style. If you buy this cd, the first songs you should listen to are  <br />: Just A Lil Bit <br />: Get In My Car <br />: God Gave Me Style <br /> <br />Its a good song, its just underrated right now, but people will see the difference in his music.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|The Priest is back, with a very good and safe album.  Unfortunately the safe means that most songs lack the WOW impact and take some time to get used to.  I believe Brave New World from Maiden was a better comeback.  On the other hand, it's way better than the pitiful Demolition (I liked the Jugulator though). <br /> <br />About the songs, there might be too many slow songs here.  Worth Fighting For is not bad but just a filler.  Angel is a great ballad, one of the best I heard.  Eulogy is good for depressing moments, but not my fave.  On the other songs, Judas Rising does not strike as a good opener.  Deal With The Devil may be the best song, a rocker.  Revolution is a very good, effective, catching song for a single.  Demonizer has some hints of Ripper, Ram It Down era, not bad.  Wheels of Fire has the best riff on the CD.  Hellrider has also a good riff and a great chorus.  Lochness, I did not have the patience to listen to it entirely yet.   <br /> <br />A good return, grows on you over time, but it lacks the slap on your face of songs like Painkiller, Green Manalishi or Hell Bent for Leather.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Just wanted to add to the list of 5-star reviews. Terrific album.
B0007O38F8|3.0|I am left disapointed after listening to this cd, after Candy shop and Disco Inferno the rest of the songs on this album sound like remixes to the songs I mentioned before. Maybe I am old fashioned but I would like to have some lyrical content and fifty lyricaly is no where in the same league as Nas JayZ Jada or even Luda. The Album will proberly sell like bananas but personaly i wouldnt be surprised if 50 Cent albums after this will see lower sales, I meen unless he starts a beef with Eminem the only other rapper in his pop appeal catagory, who would blow him away lyricaly, then he has out lived all his hype.
0790729652|4.0|THIS BATMAN MOVIE IS THE BEST ONE, THE STORYLINE IS VERY GOOD, THE ACTING IS VERY GOOD TOO, ESPECIALLY JACK NICHOLSON AS THE JOKER AND MICHAEL KEATON AS BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE HE WAS THE PERFECT ONE FOR THIS ROLE, AS FAR AS THE DVD IS CONCERN I GAVE IT ZERO STARS BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING, NO COMMENTARY FROM THE DIRECTOR, NOR FROM THE ACTORS, AND NOT EVEN A THEATER TRAILER SO IN CONCLUSION THE MOVIE IS THE BEST, BUT THE DVD NO WAY!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta, formed after At The Drive-In broke up by former members Cedric and Omar has taken alternative rock to a whole new level.  There first full album, De-Loused in the Comatorium, was a masterpiece of a concept album, gaining glowing reviews from even the most mainstream reviewers.  Nobody seemed to think they would be able to top it.  Then Frances the Mute came along.  Blending latin, jazz, and alternative rock to redefine their own style, they've done it.  Whether or not it is different than De-Loused in the Comatorium is hard to say, they're both astounding.  It's different, much more spacey and emotional, which may turn some listeners off, but it's one of the few albums that actually manages to get better with each listen instead of getting duller.  The songs originally seem hopelessly chaotic, but with every listen everything blends together until it all makes perfect sense, and when it does you realize that this is, without a doubt, album of the year material.  Best to take each song one at a time, though they all flow together into one massive track and are best listened to straight through from beginning to end.  1. Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus starts out straight and melodic but soon shifts into typical Mars Volta territory, sounding at first hopelessy complex.  But it comes through and winds together until it is an entirely coherent song, and an excellent one at that.  2. The Widow is, on its own, an excellent song.  Following the style of Televators it croons softly and melodically, with an infectious melody and excellent effect.  My only worry is that people will be left thinking that this is the style of the whole album, since it gets all the radio play, leaving them disappointed that the album isn't as accessible as this song.  Still a very strong song, showing off the softer side of The Mars Volta.  3. L'Via L'Viaquez starts off in Spanish, and stays that way for most of the song.  However, it perfectly blends together latin beats and riffs with The Mars Volta's psychadelic style to incredible effect, shifting between blasts of Spanish and softer, still distinctly latin-sounding English passages.  The song stays consistent through the switch-offs, and in the end comes off as yet another excellent song.  4.Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore seems to get a lot of animosity from the majority of reviewers, but I cannot see why.  It starts off with a long, quiet synthesizer beginning, but I would expect most Mars Volta listeners to be used to this, especially those who loved Cassandra Gemini but not this one.  It starts off slow then yields to the crescendo of melancholy trumpets, before the vocals come in with an emotional slur.  The melody and lyrics combined on this song makes it excellent.  Another nice slow passage, but still an excellent one. Probably one of the catchier ones on the album.  5. Cassandra Gemini is a bit hard to describe.  It's long and largely instrumental, but in the end it leaves you stunned with a hugely epic feel about it.  The whole song is very excellent if you have the time to listen to it, and really caps off the album in a nice way, though it is sometimes tempting to stop before its 32 minute resolution.  No part of this song is bad and, like all the songs on the album, gets better with each listen.  It ends repeating the same excellent melodic passage that the album starts with, reminding you that the album really ties together as a single entity.  Overall, The Mars Volta have really outdone themselves with this one.  We can only hope that they will continue their tradition of topping themselves with each consecutive album.  A must buy even if you don't listen to alternative.

B0007O38F8|5.0|this album is the best album of 2005 and is my favorite of all time. this is 50 at his finest. all those reviews with people saying it sucks are just mad cause they ain't where hes at. the songs are all fire from 1 to 22. just push play and ride. every track is hott. my favorite tracks are:ryder music, just a lil bit, in my hood, get in my car, ski mask ways etc.. <br />get this album. there is no disappointment at all!!!!
B0007O38F8|5.0|this cd is wat its about, all the people that dont think so are just messed. The Best songs on the cd are: <br />1. Im Suppose 2 Die 2night <br />2. My Toy Soldier ft. Tony Yayo <br />3. Ski Mask Way <br />4. Gatman and Robin ft. Eminem <br />5. Get In My Car <br />I like all the songs so for all the haters go pick up some Ja Rule hes just like you
B0007O38F8|1.0|I was going to make sure and post a comment on how bad this disk was, but apparently everybody can tell.  This is a weak disk, it is the same thing over and over.  The first one showed hints of it but was his first release so it made up for it.  This got rid of the doubt.  50 aint nothin'.  Give me the Game any day, and once Detox drops its gonna be 50 who.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|this movie is so very wonderful. I just love this film. The characters have endless chemistry and they don't sing that badly either. It sounds like it could be a really corny movie and it is but it's also meaningful beneath the surface as others have said. That's a great way of putting it. Yeah...love is not a Hallmark card. It's the connection between two people that words or music help bring out.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Simple Plan was always a guilty pleasure. I never considered these guys even remotely punk, but they had some catchy songs about girls. (maybe I was just in a vunerable state)I respect (and hope) that they are making this for kids, but these lyrics are so lame. Honestly, if Bon Jovi had a kid and manufactured his \\"edge\\" then he would have this cd. Avoid.
B0007NFL18|1.0|The Massacre is a huge disappointment. Get Rich or Die Tryin is way better. The Massacre is no way to follow up a classic. 50 should have never kicked anybody out the group that put out a better CD than him this years. The Documentary is still by far the best Rap Ablum this year. The only good songs on 50's album are \\"Piggy Bank (Good just because of the hype and beef), Hate It Or Love It Remix (Just Because Game And Buck were on the record). And outta control.  <br /> <br />I suggest everyone who wants to buy the album, to buy the collector's edition version of the album, because the video game trailer is way better than the actual album. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Year:1994. Age:14 Rebellion was great! The minorities (such as I) clung to Snoop Dogg while everyone else worshipped Green Day and Nirvana. Green Day pretty muched repulsed me. 10 years later, they're one of my favorite bands. I've only liked punk music for a year so I missed the previous phase. Anyway, I bought this cd. I remember when I fist heard \\"Jesus Of Suburbia.\\" I literally froze in place. I've been there, done that, and doing it again. I'm sure you know abou the 10 minute songs. It's amazizng how they are syncronized perfectly. I mean sound wise, it's not like it's a MASSIVE departure from the other ones, it's more of a summary of all their albums with a new twist. It really plays out like a movie. Very similar to the layout of Zen Arcade. This really makes you question where you are in life and what you're doing with it. There is a song for every emotion that you can possibly expereince. Like I said in another review, this isn't even about punk anymore-just good music!

B0007O38F8|3.0|i honestly think this album could of been better than that i'm a little disapointed in 50 but it's different from get rich and die tryin thts the best album from 50 besides his mixtapes theres only like 5 good songs out of 22 thats knd of bad cayse the g unit cd was gangsta good but masacare not so good cause on some tracks hes singing on the games album is hell of a lot better.
B0007O38F8|3.0|Can someone write a proper review reflecting on the album. Not on the beefs and play hating. Honestly I haven't heard more than 5 tracks on this album but I feel it. Not many artists in this era can re-create a masterpiece. Illmatic for example. So for beginning I give it 3 mics. I read most of reviews on this joint but I'd say 95 percent of them sucks.

I read it and while mildly entertained, I was really let down by the ludicous gaps in knowlege of systems and storage which are main elements in the book.

He refers to systems having hard drives, and in the same breath notes 'and if they shut down the power, all the information will be lost forever!!'  Right.

B0007O38F8|2.0|I have now had this ablum for 3 days I give it 2 1/2 stars (yes I may have iilegally got it but who cares) and its not what i expected at all. There are 22 tracks on this CD i liked 5: 1. \\"this is 50\\" 2. \\"Im suppose to die tonight\\" 3. \\"Just a little bit\\" 4. \\"Candy Shop\\" 5. \\"Disco Inferno\\" some tracks are starting to grow on me but not worth mentioning. Overall this album is not worth the price i would not buy it!!! He needs to get off ja rule and work on is own stuff. i am a huge g unit fan but this was the worse cd g unit has put out hands down. You may need to go get The Documentary since i few of 50 songs got but on The Games album. But before you review it I would suggest you listen to it a few times, because it is no a cd you may like the first time you hear it!
B0007NFL18|4.0|First off, I just wanna remind everyone that 50's first major record label debut cd 'get rich or die tryin,' was HUGE.  That cd revived gangsta rap for the first time since biggie and 2pac.  That being said, this cd, the massacre, had very big shoes to fill.  So, when listening to this one, don't try to compare the two, b/c the first one was probably one of the best hip hop recordings ever.   <br />For everyone out there who listened to this cd once and reviewed it, your opinions don't count.  You can't listen to any cd once and think you know how good it is, it takes time to let it grow on you.  On first listen, I heard some tracks I liked.  Second time through, I liked a lot of them.  After just a few days of having it, I'm already addicted.  This cd is 50 at his best.  He switches up flows like whoa on nearly every track, and has several producers so each track is different from the next.  50's slow flow is one of a kind.  Several tracks remind me of 50 on his unreleased 'Power of the Dollar.'   <br />So, overall I'd say this cd is like an 8 on a scale of 1-10.  It's not his best, but it's still very good.  And it's still much better than most of the other crap (i.e. fat joe, ja rule, etc.) being put out these days.
B0007O38F8|4.0|I don't understand what people expected from this album.  It seems that everyone is extremely let down.  I'm not a huge fan of 50's and I think this is a solid sophmore effort.  50 has never been the greatest lyricist, and he admits that.  The production is outstanding, it may be a little too polished and not gully enough but I feel the same way about GRODT.  I like the use of different producers, not just dre, who gets to concentrate his efforts on a few solid tracks on this album.  There are a couple of garbage tracks, including the 2 singles, I feel that candy shop is kind of corny, but the production is tight, and disco inferno im just sick of hearing but, also tight production.  the hate or love it remix is good except that 50 doesnt spit a new verse which is pretty lame, but its just a bonus track anyways. 50's flow on the chorus for Im supposed to die tonight is definitley different for a change which i think is good, and em goes 1 for 2 cuz the production is tight here too, although gatman and robbin is pretty corny but bearable. The majority of the album is still pretty tight, I give it 3 1/2 stars, but I rounded up to 4 for all of the haters out there. <br />Highlights: Gunz Come Out, Ski Mask way <br />Garbage tracks: Candy Shop, So amazing, Build you up

When he awakens, he finds himself submerged into a water-filled bathtub.  He gets out and finds another man, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, Twister [1996]) also in this unclean bathroom.  Lawrence is chained to a pipe too.  A third man has been killed and is lying on the floor.  The men don't remember how they got there.  They discover each has an envelope in their pocket with their name on it.  Inside the envelope is a mini-tape labeled &#34;play me&#34;, a bullet and a small key.<br />  They manage to get the tape recorder away from the dead man.  The message for Adam is, &#34;Are you going to watch yourself die, Adam, or do something about it&#34;.  Lawrence's message is that he must kill Adam by 6:00am or his wife and child will die and he will be left to rot in this bathroom.<br />  This industrial bathroom contains many more clues for the men.

B0007NFL1S|3.0|This is not the best from 50. It's not great and it's not bad. Some song just plain stink, while others (Candy Shop) are great. <br />If your expecting a great cd like his last one you will be dissapointed. I would not buy the collectors edition for the extra's either just not worth it.
B0007O38F8|3.0|First of all.. Fat Joe is a joke and i dont care who disagrees. You're right, 50's cd can use a little improvement in SOME of the lyrics or choruses. But for the most part, what do you expect. Rappin about leaving your brains on the pavement is what 50 is about. Listen to his first CD and Get Rich or Die Tryin and tell me I'm wrong. You can't. And in regards to New York hip hop: 50 is callin people out because he got called out. For those who dont know, at a concert in NYC-- Nas who was on tour with Fat Joe and Jadakiss at the time reportedly made comments about 50s music and said that Nas is real New York rap along with Jada and Joe. FALSE. Right now the only credit that New York is gonna get will be from 50 , Nas, or Jay so please everyone else-- (Jadakiss and fake-a$$ Fat Joe) Just Lean Back Dogg. I give this CD 3 stars out of 5. The production is good and the lyrics are as interesting as before. It doesn't surpass Get Rich or Die Tryin by any means but it is a solid album. Im just waitin for the double-disc so 50 can take out everyone whos fakin and not just the ones who cant keep their mouth shut. I would have to say the only mistake 50 has made is droppin Game. Big ups to Game cuz the CD is hott no matter who wants credit. Compton's back in the face of The Game wit Dre on da side. Peace
B0007O38F8|5.0|Alright heres the deal. People are saying this album isnt as good as expected. What you people needa realize is \\"get rich or die tryin\\" was one of the sickest rap cds ever to come out. which means its almost impossible to come out with a \\"better\\" album. I give 50 lots of support for this CD. If you like 50 cent then you def. needa get this album. This is def the best cd that iv boughten over the past few years. Just a lil bit is off the hook, along with this is 50, somebodys gonna die tonight, hate it or love it remix.  NOW GO GET IT
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen several productions of this musical and have owned the Original Cast Recording since 1988. Yet, while I thrill to the sound of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman's incredible voices and the sight of the chandelier rising into the rafters, even I must admit that there has always been something missing from Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version. There are many scenes (\\"Notes\\" springs instantly to mind) that feel...well...stagy, and the story is as thin as a sheet of music. It was my hope that a film version would \\"open up\\" the opera house and flesh out this tale of Beauty and the Beast. <br /> <br />I was not disappointed.       <br /> <br />Director, co-writer Joel Schumacher delivers a fully fashioned tale that embraces the spectacle of the source material and even, dare I say it, improves upon it.  Working with an all-star production team that included designer Anthony Pratt (\\"Excalibur\\"), art director John Fenner (\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"), set decorator Celia Bobak (Branagh's \\"Henry V\\" and \\"Hamlet\\") and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (\\"Elizabeth\\"), Schumacher's big-screen adaptation is filled with awe-inspiring moments--yet the screenplay also serves to heighten the original material's sense of longing and loss.  Nowhere is this clearer than in the black-and-white passages the director uses to separate the acts.  Like James Cameron's Titanic, these interludes, glimpses of a dark and dreary future, serve to lament the loss of youth and the death of magic. Schumacher's script also delves deeper into the psychology of the characters: Christine believes the Phantom to be the ghost of her dead father.  Light is shed on his dark origins, and we lean much more about his connection to the strict Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson).  <br /> <br />Those who long to see Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman may criticize the casting of Gerard Butler as the (only slightly) deformed Phantom, but at 18, Emmy Rossum, Jake Gyllenhaal's girlfriend in The Day After Tomorrow, gives a star-making performance as Christine--the ballet girl who's beautiful face and voice win his admiration. Having performed in New York's Metropolitan Opera at the tender age of 7, Rossum is a phenomenal talent.  She gives the role just the right mix of emotional depth and childlike wonder.   <br /> <br />Even Webber's score seems improved.  As the power of the 100-piece orchestra explodes from every speaker, any doubts I may have had about the ability of the musical to make the leap from stage to screen are shattered.  This is what moviegoing is all about. It holds sway over the audience until the final frame, and has you thinking about it for days afterward.  Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004WGAI|5.0|I fell in love with the story of Jane Eyre when I saw the Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine version years ago.  I read the novel then, and ever since (20+years) it's been my absolute favorite book.  I re-read it at least once a year.  I was thrilled to find the VHS version of this BBC miniseries about 15 years ago, and I have never seen a film that so well captured the essence of the book.  The series may seem a bit long, but for those of us who savor Charlotte Bronte's novel, it's wonderful! Timothy Dalton IS Rochester,and Zelah Clarke is a marvelous Jane.  Some say she was too old to play Jane; I disagree... she was approximately 25 years old when the movie was made.  Hardly ancient.  I have also seen reviews that call her fat.  She is definitely NOT...I have seen pictures of her in modern dress and she is rather petite.  The wardrobe in the movie made her look a bit dumpy, but then, Jane Eyre is NOT a beauty!  I think she had plenty of spirit and spunk in this film and it's truly a shame that her acting career didn't take off after this role.    I have seen other versions of Jane Eyre; Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton did a decent job, but the story was hacked to bits; William Hurt was a HORRIBLE Rochester.  He had no spirit..dull, listless,and passionless. UGH.  I even rented the movie once to see if it was as bad as I'd remembered it from the theater.  YUP.  People who are true afficianados of the book will love this production.  Some of the movie making is a little under par (this is a made for TV miniseries, and is 20 years old, after all), but the script and the acting make up for the poor makeup and lighting.  I give it thumbs WAY WAY WAY UP!!    UPDATE:  I received my DVD today (Thanks to Amazon for shipping it so that I received it on the day it was released!  Woohoo!!)  The restored footage was marvelous...no new footage of Timothy Dalton, but lots of footage involving Sian Pattenden, who played the young Jane (and a lot of great background establishing her passionate personality!)...and much new material involving St. John, Diana and Mary!  I loved it!  They even included Rosamund Oliver, who was completely cut out of the 4 hour VHS version.  Thanks BBC for finally releasing this marvelous TV miniseries on DVD for us \\"Eyre-heads.\\"  What a treat.  However, one small complaint..couldn't you have given us just a little extra?  Maybe a short little interview with Zelah Clarke and/or Timothy Dalton or even Sian Pattenden about the filming of?  I guess for the price I shouldn't complain...but I would have paid more for a special edition.  Thanks, though, really!
B000001FN3|3.0|I have the original on vinyl. This \\"remake\\", adding Orson Wells and the sythesizer, did nothing to improve this album. One of the other reviewers got it right... <br />\\"The '87 reworking of the album has added nothing of note and actually is more distracting, especially if you are familiar with the first version. Inserted are guitar licks that make more noise on the tracks but don't add more meaning or give more substance.\\" <br />Buying this was my mistake. I didn't pay enough attention to the reviews already listed. If I had it to over, I wouldn't but this version. <br /> <br />
B0006IIPIK|3.0|This movie soars mainly because of the interesting visual effects and its star power (namely Jude Law, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie). A lot of the plot was kind of difficult to follow, but here's what I made out about the characters: <br />Jude Law plays a famous pilot who's good at like destroying stuff, I guess. Gwenyth Paltrow plays a very dogged reporter who apparently has some kind of past with Law. Jolie is a pilot who seemingly had an affair with Law, which upset Paltrow.  <br />The best parts in this movie are when Law and Paltrow are trading one-liners. The last ten seconds or so of the film made me laugh hysterically. <br />All in all, this is movie that has its hits and misses, and is probably worth seeing, even if some of the battle sequences seem a little unneccessary and long.
B0007O38F8|4.0|When I first heard the album all the way through I was extremely dissapointed.  Sense then I've been listening to it all the time and really has grown on me.  At first I couldn't get past how sad he is lyrically, like allright 50 you wear bulletproof vests, stay strapped, and are still hood, you dont need to try and convince everyone of that in everysong.  And piggybank is absurd the people he calls out are some of the best in hip hop and he doesn't even have a good reason for callin them out and he's going to get lyrically torn up by them.  The thing is though the more you listen 50's ability to write a catchy flow and switch it up overpowers the lyricall problems.  People saying this album is the worst thing ever are just plain wrong, the beats flow and hooks are always good and sometimes great.  Gatman and Robin definitely the weakest produces track, Eminem needs to give up producin he already ruined his last two albums and tupacs, however his flow on the track actually makes it worthwhile to listen to.  In summary this album makes me think less of 50 as a person and almost hope he falls off but he defintely puts in his time making these tracks sound hot so I can't hate on the album.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I knew this album wasnt going to be close to \\"Get rich or die Trying\\", but damn  i almost want to call him gay for this B.S he calls the massacre. people please download,buy it for less than 10$ (bootleg), or whatever you can do to keep from bying this album. Ima save my time to tell u fans how this cd is..................GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|It's hard, it's rock and it kicks ass!
B0007O38F8|2.0|Okay Just listened to 50 cent album the \\"massacre.\\" The album had a few nice beats Candyshop of course with the help of Olivia, Disco Inferno and Gatman And Robin (without lyrics) are songs with nice tracks they are the best of all the songs on the album. But this is a weak LYRICALLY INCOMPETENT album. Nothing special and the piggy bank song is the worst Diss song ever made and to diss Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Shine, Nas and other rap elite's He should have thought about something else to say and a better beat.  And to say that The Game album was his so he 50 cent say should have kept it for himself cause The Game album is 1000 times better.
0783232039|3.0|Sadism, loads of black humor, and a gratiguous amount of gore bring \\"Bride of Chucky\\" to a somewhat higher level than the previous sequel (even though the original 'Child's Play' is, thus far, the most impactive). As far as sequels go, \\"Bride\\" may even have gained the series the \\"cult classic\\" status. <br />   <br />  Dourif lives again voicing the maniacal serial-killing Cabbage Patch Kid, rescued from the slammer's \\"unsolved\\" dept., by a slick n' sexy best girl, Jen Tilly. Once back at her trailer-park paradise, Tiffany (Tilly) attempts some hokey voodoo to revive her dolly dearest, but to (apparently) no avail. Enter Manson-wannabe new boyfriend Arquette, who wants some 'Le Petite Morte,' when Tif realizes that the spell worked after all. After Arquette meets a grisly end, Chuck and Tiffany discuss thier marraige, a surprise to Chuckie, and a laughable one. Bad move #1. Tifany cages the brat, and decides to pop in 'Bride of Frankenstein,' while taking a little bath. Bad move #2. Chuck breaks out, electrocutes the tub-slut, and transfers her spirit into a bridal doll she gave her hubby as a joke. The jokes on her of course, and from there, it's all blood-and-guts to the point that the tiresome sub-plot doesn't amount to a bucket of red karo syrup to the viewer. <br /> <br />  Director Yu means well, and for the real psycho/gore-hungry thrill seekers, the acting abilities on part of the primary and lesser cast members is fairly pleasing. What will have most hooked to the film is it's unique utilization of Rob Zombie music, cheap thrills, and excellent black humor to keep the story rolling.  <br /> <br />   Heigl and Stabile play two teens who find themselves chauffering the dolls to Chuck's grave-site in order to unearth the medallion, that can bring Tilly and Dourif's souls back to life. Ritter has a bit-part as the ill-fated cop/caretaker of Heigl's Jade, that get's a bit more nosy than Chucky can stand. <br />  <br />   90's cultish atmosphere is suitable forthe overall cheesiness of the film, complete with a haunted graveyard-during-a-thunderstorm climax. (Makes the anticipation of \\"Seed of Chucky\\" all the more nerve-rattling.) One of the many types of movies that you'll want to rent with some friends on a late Friday night, with a large bowl of butter-lover's popcorn with the lights off. <br /> <br />Saw it, liked it more than I thought I would,(but returned it to the video store anyway,) <br />--GIGI     <br />
B000002KAT|5.0|It doesn't get better than this.  <br /> <br />It's primarily Van and his acoustic guitar, a tight jazz rhythm section (but has Van far more in the forefront than he would be in later recordings where he blends in more), with vibes and flutes rounding it out.  <br /> <br />Every song is great. They speak for themselves and it's really hard to believe that the man who came up with garage rock classic \\"Gloria\\" and the singalong \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" would come up with something like this.  <br /> <br />Each song is clear, poetic, and like a painting, you come back to and look at to appreciate it as well as study it.  <br /> <br />I think some people should check out the \\"Bang\\" era recordings to see how a couple of the songs started out, and when he played the coffeehouses in Boston, the songs were reworked into what would wind up here.  <br /> <br />The only recommendation I could make are putting out the demos (none of which made it to \\"Philosopher's Stone\\", try to dig up the few TV appearances he did at the time (WPIX and in Boston), as well as Peter Wolf of J. Geils Band releasing his tape of the types of shows he was doing at the time, which is as important as Velvet Underground's \\"Live at Max's\\" or \\"1969\\" because the way these songs are done have never been the same since.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|This much anticipated album starts off with a truly smokin' track &quot;Judas Rising&quot;...an awesome Halfordesque track, followed by a more melodic yet vibrant track &quot;Deal with the Devil&quot; which rates well. The third track is one you'll hear on the radio and is a bit dated in sound actually - not what I would call classic Priest by any stretch.  Interesting bass at the beginning but sounding a bit too commercial overall. Track 4, &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot; is reminiscent of older Judas Priest and would also do well on radio.  Track 5 &quot;Demonizer&quot; is another awesome smoker. Track 6, &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; is back to what would likely be a crowd pleaser for the sing-along aspect(and not the &quot;United&quot; style). A  good track and would also do well on radio.  &quot;Angel&quot; is almost an all acoustic song - highlighting Halford's voice - much like &quot;The last rose of summer&quot; done years ago - very good indeed. &quot;Hellrider&quot; is a solid track with vocal harmonies again but keeping them limited keeps this song among the best on the album.  Sure to be a crowd pleaser. &quot;Eulogy&quot; is a short vocal highlight again for Halford, including historical references to previous Judas Priest tracks which puts you in a good place.  The final track on the album is a mammoth 13 minute plus track that also rates well...very heavy and will do well in concert.  All in all, a good album and variety of tracks for your listening pleasure.  Was looking forward to a bit more guitar work from Glenn Tipton and K.K. Dowing as the tracks give you a little taste of their twin playing but could have been more prevalent on a few tracks.  Was a huge fan of Halford's solo work and always into Judas Priest and can say this album does not disappoint.  I look forward to seeing them live again...you can't beat Halford's classic voice and I hope for future albums and &quot;screaming heavy metal&quot; from the so-called &quot;Metal Gods&quot;.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I have totally become addicted to Gilmore Gils and I cannot wait until the third season comes out on DVD!  At first I did not want anything to do with the show when it first came into reruns.  I thought, \\"God, why put this on ABC Family and bump Boy Meets World to an earlier time slot?\\"  But then as I began to watch bits and pieces of the shows I began to relize what a corky and funny show it truely is.  I was really missing out.  Since then I have not missed a NEW episode and I even have to get dressed in YALE attire to watch it (call me crazy)...  I own both seasons One and Two and I highly reccomend them.  I watch them everyday and can almost recite most of the episodes by now.  Gilmore Girls is the best show on television, I've even gotten my whole family into it (including my dad)...  And for all the other Gilmore fans out there, I feel your pain when you say 'I can't wait for Season Three!'
B00063MBU8|2.0|A complete lack of originality, paired with an abundance of over-commercialization to make up for a lack of talent, and voila! Simple Plan! These guys are certainly still not getting any (respect) from me. With about as much punk credibility as Avril Lavigne, I have to sit back and laugh when these guys jump around on TRL and think they really just rocked the place to its foundation. Nice try. I abolsolutely hate genuine punk rock, which is why I think I like these guys even less. I don't like the music they make, and I dislike even more the music they try to imitate. For pop-rock done right, check out SUM 41 from Ajax, Ontario or Hawk Nelson from Peterborough, Ontario. For you American viewers looking for a geography lesson, Ajax and Peterborough are on the far outskirts of Toronto. So in closing, sorry Pierre, but the last rebelious thing to come out of Montreal, was Louis Riel, and everyone hated him. Here's to overrunning Native American land with european modernization tactics! Haa-zaa!
B00006LWSF|4.0|I only liked the album for like some songs. some of the songs on it were unnessesary like with macy gray and stuff. Lose yourself and 8 Mile were the song i always kept playing for like 4 months straight.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|This is quite possibly the catchiest album ever recorded.  It's funny and the musicianship is good, what more could you possibly want for your 15 bucks.  I'm sure you'd like a lot more you greedy [...].  Oh yeah peace to Zombo! I got my ticket. WORD
B0007O38F8|1.0|If you want to listen to some real 50 Cent go buy Get Rich or Die Tryin'.  This album his pure garbage.  I can't believe I just wasted my $15 on this horrible album.  In Da Club was a better single than Disco Inferno and Candy Shop put together.  50 Cent has no flow and the choruses suck.  Eminem yet again destroys 50 on his own track, if I was 50 I'd be embarrassed.  He hyped up his album just to sell records, don't buy into it. Don't waste your money on this album unless you are a die hard 50 fan or you won't like it.
B0007O38F8|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.  ITS A BIG WASTE OF MONEY. <br /> <br />DOWNLOAD THE ALBUM FOR FREE IF YOU HAVE TO. <br /> <br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON G-UNIT OR THIS ALBUM.  <br />SPEND YOUR MONEY SOME OTHER WAY.
B0007O38F8|5.0|All ya'll hatin on 50, seriously need to check it.  This album is hot, n all u 50 haters can't make this album any less than it is.  50 doesnt need Dre or Em, he's on their level at least and this album is twice as hot as Get Rich n I loved that disc.  All i gotta say is if u ain't copped this yet, go get it and pay no heed to all these haters. Ya'll mad cuz he's got beef, all the hype, whatever...hip hop was born from the battle.  It prolly is all hype but hey, obviously it works cuz u fools be buyin it.  The album is hot, regardless of the beef.  I don't think 50 cares about offendin anybody.. all he's concerned wit is droppin hot albums and rakin in the green.  In this case he'll be successful wit both of dem.
B0007O38F8|5.0|I am not saying that 50's new album is hot just because I like 50 cent but when you listen, not hear, but listen to the songs there is about 15 hot songs. Besides Disco Inferno and Candy Shop, which are having mad airplay... Just a Lil Bit, Ryder Music, Get in my car, Outta Control, The Ski Mask Way, God Gave Me Style are hot songs just to name a few. 50 really took his time on this one and produced a hit.
B0007O38F8|1.0|i dunt kno wut 50 is doin he comes out with this album that is suppose to be better than get rich or die tryin and defitinley isnt its horrible then he kicks the game out of g-unit its just all horrible
B0007O38F8|3.0|Not as great as his previous commercial release with \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" but don't sell the LP short yet. Dre, Eminem, Needlz among others do fantastic production work on the beats. Lyrically its not remotely close to \\"Get Rich..\\" but its better than most of the garbage commercial music has been putting out recently. Still he could have done without the easy method to sell records by voicing his beefs on tracks like 'Piggy Bank' but thats his M.O. and his selling point. So, he does what he says he does.  <br /> <br />This album starts out slower than what you would expect but picks up with a lot of sure-fire club beats that are gonna probably blow up like \\"In the Club\\" so expect more of the same. Wavers near the end of the album too. Still, don't hate before you hear; make the decision yourself. Its worth a listen thru or two and won't hurt your current collection.    <br /> <br />An honest review because it seems too many people take \\"sides\\" these days. Like he says in the end, you'll hate it or love it.
0684857820|4.0|After reading Lovely Bones, it seemed nearly impossible to have another moving emotional book such as that by the same author, but after reading Lucky I was truly amazed. Lucky begins with the tragic event of rape that Alice Sebold encounters and continues into her struggle afterwards. The detail that Sebold reaches through this novel allows the reader to get somewhat of an understanding of this traumatic experience and difficult journey she began after rape. After reading this book the perspective on society takes a different outlook because Lucky allows the reader to realize how hard society is on people because of what people have heard. Lucky goes further into detail of events that occur after her rape, even with such a difficult subject. Sebold does an amazing job with expressing her emotions and experiences through her long struggle.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|A pulverizing bolt of electricity and `nervous system energizing' that rivet to the core. It's hard to believe that so many years after they unleashed the wonderful Painkiller upon this planet, they are resurrected to haunt and stimulate again. The majesty of Priest - dead earnest camp and leather still intact - with all its glorious mythology that leaves you guessing whether salvation or destruction is more appealing, delivers the infinite metal mayhem you have been patiently awaiting. All your senses will be heightened with this masterful metal display. This extraordinary album blends a special concoction of mysterious, epic ballads and powerful, skull crushingly savory cacophonies and fugues of rock. What's new with this one? How about gorgeous displays of psychedelia and blues to go with heavy doses of mind melting metal? What is it that's so soothing about those familiar, though strangely always advancing, screeching vocals and the blasting guitar symphonies, not to mention the thunderous drums - that bring one into higher states of Zen? What is this special magic that arose from industrial England to explode with furious beauty and audible ambrosia all over the world for many decades? The artwork is stunning and the legacy continues into delightful new aural addictions.<br /><br />God bless this angel of retribution. All sins are absolved.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is one of the 3 best albums in the history of hip-hop, joining such classics \\"Ready to Die\\" and \\"Liquid Swords\\". While most rappers rap about stuff that most heads cannot relate to (for an exampple of this, see Cash Money Records), Nas raps about life in all of its painful and joyful aspects. Nas takes us on a brilliant journey that is only 9 songs long, but these 9 songs are complete masterpieces with no filler tracks or meaningless skits. If you do not own this album, you are not a true hip-hop head!

B0007O38F8|1.0|First of all, perhaps 50 Cent could come up with some new and original material besides guns, women, and chrome wheels! 50 has some nice beats but has shown no signs of lyrical growth or maturity on this album. He talks about the same played-out subjects over and over. Another thing is that it's not wise to diss Nas on your album; Jay Z already tried that and failed after Nas tore him to shreds. I don't think that 50 wants any part of Nas, in terms of a lyrical battle. After all, Nas is a rap legend with four classic albums (Illmatic, It was Written, Stillmatic and God's Son) whereas 50 is just another below-average rapper who has to boast and brag about getting shot. Anyways, there are a few decent songs on \\"The Massacre\\" but these few songs are not worth the $15. My advice: download the good songs but don't get the album!
B0007O38F8|1.0|I loved \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" and I thought 50 was gonna better himself as a rapper, but as we see, money has gotten the best of him.  We see this all the time in the music business.  So for anybody who doesn't have a clue on how to buy good music, don't expect somebody's second album to be better than their first.   And one more thing for those who bought this album, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET AND LISTEN TO ALBUMS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!
B0007NFL18|1.0|After 2 years, and 60 songs, how... JUST HOW?!?!?!?! can this album be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad? can these really be the best songs he can pick out of 60?!?!?! Someone get Jimmy Ivine on the phone, somethings gotta change....
1558908382|5.0|Grosse Point Blank, starring John Cusack and Minnie Driver, was quite enjoyable. It focused on a professional hit man (Martin Blank, played by John Cusack) with the gruesome task of completing his next mission in his hometown of Grosse Point, Michigan, to which he relunctantly accepts. He returns to Grosse Point on the weekend of his High School reunion. When he returns to Grosse Point, he finds his former girlfriend Debbie, who he abandoned on prom night. While in Grosse Point, he is also on the run from an angry associate's henchmen. This was a very funny dark comedy with a few slightly violent scences and a moderate amount of profanities. I would recommend this movie to many.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Just listen to this, this is garbage!!! don't waste your money on it! download the damn thing off the internet if your curious to find out how bad this actually is! Man I put it in my cd player, I got through 2 songs with excrutiating pain, rolled down the window and tossed it! Lyrics are worse than Camron! Sounds like he made the whole album high and drunk out his mind, cuz if he thinks this will massacre anything, then he must be CRAZY!!!! If there was a zero stars option, this would definately get it. Giving this album away for free should be illegal!
B000002G23|5.0|Now if only all box sets were this good! A MUST HAVE for Police fans! Not only does it have their best material but you can hear the evolution of Sting's incredible songwriting and Stewart's unbelievable drumming skills.  They basically started off as punkish band ripping off reggae but the band slowly evolved into their own sound! It's a shame when they found their sound they broke up. But as you can tell by Sting's incredible songwriting on Disc 4, it was time for him to leave. <br />It was time for him to see the Blue Turtles! Just to have the haunting tunes \\"Burn For You\\" and \\"Once Upon A Daydream\\" is worth the price of the box set alone
B0007NFL18|1.0|I heard this album about 2 weeks ago and I was very dissapointed. All of the beats xcept for Just A Lil Bit are WACK. 50's lyrics are horrible, he raps about the same stuff over and over. The song Piggy Bank had so much hype, but when I heard it I immediately turned it off because the beat is awful. I recomend everyone to not buy this cd, because you will be just wasting your money.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|This movie is beautifully done.  Wonderful sets, costumes, and acting.  You will not be dissapointed.  I watch it once a year and have not tired of it yet. The plot and characters will draw you in from the beginning to end. I cry almost every time I watch it.  Ralph F. and Juliet B. are absolutely excellent in the movie and in every movie.  Highly recomended.
B00005A0N5|5.0|I was listening to the usual shouting hardcore stuff I do not like on a heavy metal radio link on cable and once in a while they mix in something besides hardcore and rap metal. I was in the other room when a song by Nightwish came on and I stopped what I was doing and rushed in to catch the name of the band. That led to the purchase of this album and it blew me away! Power metal with Tarja's operatic vocals. What a combination! I love this album and I bought it the same day as I picked up an album by Finntroll, another Finnish band.<br /><br />Some would consider this too \\"pop\\" or too classic metal but I cannot find a thing wrong with that! These guys (and girl) rock! Do yourself a favor and seek this album out. It is so different from what else is out there.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay's a \\"Rush of Blood to the Head is amazing.  Yet it doesn't live up to Parachutes, which was just so wonderful-it was a change from the regular music we hear.  I do like this CD but would recommend Parachutes over this one.
1400032717|1.0|Crap.  Crap.  Megacrap.  I can't believe so many people enjoyed this crappy book.  Maybe I should have read it in third grade.  I have never wasted more time on a stupider book in my life.  Please don't buy this book.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is your surfer guy music.  It is laid back and just like going on a vacation to a sunny beach and sitting around.  I love his music!  This CD is just as great as Brushfire Fairytales;  it lived up to my high standards.  I am really pleased he stuck with his same sound, because that is what works for him!  This CD is amazing and if you like his first CD then you should definitely buy this one.  Or if you are just now hearing about Jack you should buy this if you like funky, surfer music.  You will be pleased.
0316666343|5.0|The first time I heard about \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" someone else I knew was reading it.  She described it as very powerful, at times disturbing, but an excellent book.  I was interested... for about two seconds.  When I finally came across the novel on a shelf at my local bookstore, I remembered how much my friend had enjoyed it.  I read the entire book on a plane ride to Hawaii, never pausing.  It was great.  I can honestly say that I have never read anything like it before.  Alice Sebold has created something magical here, something I will be glad to reread every once in a while.  So naturally, I am surprised to see that a few people disliked it so much.  My only advice would be to read it yourself.  Don't let someone else decide for you.  I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed with this one.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Room For Squares is an awesome CD.  It is still on high rotation even though it is a few years old. It is a great CD for people young and old as my sister loves him and so does my mom.  John Mayer has a quirkiness about him that pulls you into his music.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Jack Johnson, Howie Day or anyone that has a similar sound you will love this CD too.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream has to be one of the best movies that I have watched.  This movie does not contain explosions, car chases, or shoot-outs that other movies rely on to draw an audience.  What Requiem possesses is far beyond that on an intellectual and emotional level.  This film will take you on a journey through aspects of life that most people either ignore or don't realize exists.  RFAD is about four individuals whose dreams to better themselves (be it finacially, physically, or emotionally) take possession of their being and eventually destroy any aspect of their lives worth living for.  Requiem illustrates how the desire to be accepted by others and oneself can lead to disastorous results.  Words cannot describe the emotions one will experience while watching this work of art.  Journey through a tragic example of addiction, desire, and loss as Requiem will put into perspective what truly is important in life.
B0000508U6|5.0|Parachutes by Coldplay is a great CD it is full of excellent music.  I am glad that I invested in this CD as it is a wonderful collection of songs.  It is also a fresh sound.  It wasn't and still isn't like anything you heard on the radio.  I still listen to this CD often it is just a relief to listen to something fresh.
B00001IVOF|5.0|this is that real music <br />not that watered down crap on the radio <br />classic gangasta
B000089RVX|3.0|Fallen by Evanescence is an okay CD.  I am not a real big fan of the band and can't stand that they are played so much on the radio. They are overplayed here where I live which has lost a lot of fans.  I used to like the music and the CD but now I have heard the songs so much that it just irritates me. I admit their music isn't bad and maybe in like three years I will be over the fact that they are overplayed but as of now I wouldn't buy this CD if you are tired of hearing them on the radio, but, if you can still sing the songs on  the radio and enjoy them then this CD is for you!
B0007NFL18|3.0|Aside from a couple of shining moments, you're crazy if you've ever thought 50 was lyrically that good. His success is mainly due to his style/swagger, stellar beats, and undeniable hooks. Not like I'm trying to take anything away from him, but if you're expecting a whole lot of solid rhymes, let alone ones that don't involve guns & sex, 50 never has nor will be the place to go. He hasn't changed a whole lot in two years, but is he still doing it as good as he has?     \\"In My Hood\\" gets the album off to a solid start, it's a typical 50 Cent hood song and has a great beat by C. Styles & Bang Out. Overall it's good, but it's nothing special (although the Saxophone part that closes the track is real nice). \\"This Is 50\\" has a pretty grimy beat, but 50's drawl at the end of every line seems all too formulaic, taking a page right out of \\"Blood Hound\\" from \\"Get Rich...\\". It could easily grow on the listener though. Lyrically 50 copies his previous effort again with \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" (aka \\"Many Men\\" Pt. II). That being said it's one of the better tracks on the album with Eminem's production being the perfect marriage for the 50's subject matter.   \\"Piggy Bank\\" is Massacre's diss track, where the clunky beat won't really draw you in as much as the venom he spits at Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne, & Nas. To be honest this is not a big winner, the beat's not really that great but the big thing is while he disses these rappers he doesn't really say anything remotely harmful/embarrassing/clever/whatever. All this track is gonna do is make enemies & create some buzz, but he didn't have a single diss line that was memorable at all. This is a soft diss track at best, sorry no memorable \\"Back Down\\" on here.     Em produces and drops a verse for the great concept track \\"Gatman & Robbin\\". Both Mcs fit the quick paced beat quite well, Em's verse in particular will take several listens to break down.  Say what you want about the `hit' \\"Candy Shop\\", but the Scott Storch beat is simply hypnotizing and will be in the clubs for a long time. The subject matter gets a bit old (it's basically \\"Magic Stick\\" Pt. II), but the masses aren't even gonna listen to the lyrics anyway.     There is one serious problem you can see from reading the liner notes. While his previous effort was driven by four incredible Dr. Dre cuts, the producer's presence is greatly missed here as he only contributes two tracks. A Dre beat tends to bring out the best in 50, it did on \\"Get Rich\\" and the same holds true here. \\"Outta Control\\" is another classic shoulda-been Detox track and 50's hook comes off incredibly well, as it matches the high-pitched organs in the background. The strings and thumping bass in the background only add more intensity. While 50's verses aren't nearly as catchy as the hook, they certainly don't take away from this stellar track.     For \\"Get In My Car\\" Hi-Tek used a slight G-funk sound too it, and accompanies typical 50 pimping rhymes. The hook definitely has the potential to be used by every guy by the end of the summer. Disco D provides the stellar beat for \\"Ski Mask Way\\" which sounds like the score from an old Blaxploitation film, with its creative use of an O'Jays sample. This proves to one of the best tracks on here, and 50's Kool G Rap robbin' style rhymes works better than almost any other verse on the album. It's only further complete with the great hook that's doesn't have a hint of radio play in it. \\"Ski Mask Way\\" is definitely 50 at his best and most respectable.     50 actually shows some creativity on the concept \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\". While it's not a new concept to compare Drugs with Love, 50 pulls it off quite well (to spell it out for you, he's rapping as if he were heroin). Plus it's such a huge change of pace for him it's almost a shock at first. \\"Ryder Music\\", while not bad, just sounds completely uninspired. It's pretty much just lazy filler, and it doesn't even fit the title very well.     Dre somehow does not produce \\"Disco Inferno\\", instead again it's C. Styles & Bang Out. The beat and 50's hook really make this song. It's already a club hit and you either love it or hate it. Unlike that track, you can tell from the opening seconds that \\"Just A Lil Bit\\" is a typical Scott Storch production. 50 kicks some seductive rhymes (all too similar to \\"Candy Shop\\") to fit.     The final Dre track only makes you want more from the two. \\"Gunz Come Out\\", which is your less than typical Dre track, is just that dark hard-thumping gun-talk track that worked so well for \\"Heat\\". Slow horns play throughout that sound like a processional march and pounding pianos come in to compliment it. Overall it's another classic Dre & 50 track, but kinda unsatisfying knowing this is the only other spot from Dre. More of the same gun talk, comes from the high energy \\"My Toy Soldier\\" that you can't help but compare to \\"My Buddy\\" from the G-Unit album. Tony Yayo drops the all to frequent quick verse at the end of the track.     \\"Position of Power\\" has a pretty nice piano loop, although the hook is not the best. 50's typical lyrics fit nicely with the beat and are slightly more light hearted (more of a hustler song).     The album, which was carrying along pretty well, has a lot of faults towards the end.     The Scott Storch \\"Build You Up\\" has a pretty nice beat, but the Thug Luv type track is defiantly gonna be another love it or hate it track. Jamie Foxx's chorus isn't nearly as memorable as the one for \\"Slow Jams\\", it basically could have been sung by any typical R&B singer.   \\"God Gave Me Style\\" is pretty forgettable, though some might argue his cheesy lyrics here show \\"depth\\" or whatever... I'm not buying it.  \\"So Amazing\\" is SO much like a Ja Rule/Ashanti track it's sick. How could 50 possible put this song after he ripped JA for releasing this same garbage? This track is a huge disappointment, I'm not sure at all what he was thinking (nor how could Dre or Em let him put this out.)     If that wasn't bad enough,the \\"I Don't Need Em\\" COMPLETELY jacks Ghostface's \\"Metal Lungies\\" on the Pretty Toney Album. Did he think that no one would notice?? I cannot believe 50 did this, considering Ghostface's album wasn't even released more than a year ago. This really leaves the album off on a sour note for a real rap fan.     Both regular & collector's editions have the 'bonus' track \\"Hate It Or Love it (Remix)\\". The original is a great song and both the Game and 50 brought some great lyrics. Here, both 50's verses are the same, the Game's first verse is different (and actually better), the rest of G-Unit adds on a small verse, but they really sound out of place. They don't work well on the track, making this Bonus not very rewarding.     Before concluding the review of the album - despite the fact it doesn't cost much more, THE COLLECTORS EDITION IS NOT ANY BETTER. You're better off saving the $5 bucks or so and skipping the nude photos included (which is really the only difference i can see).    As good as this album can be at times, it equally falls flat in other areas. The album is just too long (1 hour and 17 min!), especially when it has more than it's fair share of duds. The Massacre would get some serious help if it was a bit more picky with the track selection, in paticular towards the end.  Fans can expect the same from 50 lyrically for the most part, which is either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Another slight problem is you almost can't help but compare a lot of the tracks from \\"Massacre\\" to 50 or G-Unit's previous work, because they just sound like they fit the same formula all too well.     Bottom Line: There's plenty of material on here that is good quality (from 50 Cent standards) and fans will end up loving the album because of this. Despite the fact that there are way too many weak tracks, the strengths will satisfy just as they did on \\"Get Rich\\", and \\"Massacre\\" will probably go at least 4x Platinum. This album as a whole is merely ok, because the good and bad balance out pretty evenly, but even knowing ahead of time won't stop anybody from picking up \\"The Massacre\\".
B000002KIE|1.0|Oh yeah were about to break down walls like i was a great red cup of kool aid. lets get a couple things straight.  <br /> <br />The whole belief that these guys pionered anything is a joke, let alone something as intricate and different as punk rock is nothing short of hilarious. I guess no one has heard of the new york dolls, i guess no one has got into bowie, and iggie and the stooges. Artists that paved the way for punk-rock so these no talent sold out ass clowns could ruin it for everyone else. The main reason why the sex pistols were so obnoxiously huge was media exposure. what?  <br /> <br />Surely youve all noticed this overtime how many times Johnny rotten sat down and interviewed with kurt loder of MTV. you know he'd usually feign fury towards the end and stomp off, but to anyone who has any knowledge of punk rock should at least know the esatblishment their defying. It's funny  how you right something down on paper; speak it out of your mouth, BUT CANT PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH. its the most blatant farse that should be obvious to everyone. To think that the pistols are even mentioned in the same sentence with bands like crass, and zounds is completely ludacris. No id compare this group to milli vanilli, because their fake.

This track is a huge disappointment, I'm not sure at all what he was thinking (nor how could Dre or Em let him put this out.)     If that wasn't bad enough,the \\"I Don't Need Em\\" COMPLETELY jacks Ghostface's \\"Metal Lungies\\" on the Pretty Toney Album. Did he think that no one would notice?? I cannot believe 50 did this, considering Ghostface's album wasn't even released more than a year ago. This really leaves the album off on a sour note for a real rap fan.     Both regular & collector's editions have the 'bonus' track \\"Hate It Or Love it (Remix)\\". The original is a great song and both the Game and 50 brought some great lyrics. Here, both 50's verses are the same, the Game's first verse is different (and actually better), the rest of G-Unit adds on a small verse, but they really sound out of place. They don't work well on the track, making this Bonus not very rewarding.     Before concluding the review of the album - despite the fact it doesn't cost much more, THE COLLECTORS EDITION IS NOT ANY BETTER. You're better off saving the $5 bucks or so and skipping the nude photos included (which is really the only difference i can see).    As good as this album can be at times, it equally falls flat in other areas. The album is just too long (1 hour and 17 min!), especially when it has more than it's fair share of duds. The Massacre would get some serious help if it was a bit more picky with the track selection, in paticular towards the end.  Fans can expect the same from 50 lyrically for the most part, which is either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Another slight problem is you almost can't help but compare a lot of the tracks from \\"Massacre\\" to 50 or G-Unit's previous work, because they just sound like they fit the same formula all too well.     Bottom Line: There's plenty of material on here that is good quality (from 50 Cent standards) and fans will end up loving the album because of this. Despite the fact that there are way too many weak tracks, the strengths will satisfy just as they did on \\"Get Rich\\", and \\"Massacre\\" will probably go at least 4x Platinum. This album as a whole is merely ok, because the good and bad balance out pretty evenly, but even knowing ahead of time won't stop anybody from picking up \\"The Massacre\\".
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Is the best sequel to De-Loused the Mars Volta could make, it was the one album that i have ever gone out on the day it came out to purchase, and @ about $8 it was totaly worth it! if you are thinking about getting it go and spent the little money that it costs to have true music... <br /> <br />laters
0553213105|5.0|If you want to understand \\"relationships\\" better ( I would like to think we all do) and you have limited time, that you can use to read, say, \\"Pscychology Today\\" and watch Oprah and Dr. Phill -- or read Jane Austen's great work -- I say go with Jane. You will learn more and enjoy a classical reading experience in the process.
080017948X|5.0|This film is great. To me, it shows the learning curve of the soul. Every lifetime that we have on earth can be analogised in one of Phil's `groundhog days'.  <br /> <br />At first, when Phil learns about his immortality, he chooses to satisfy his ego - pulling women, eating unlimited cream cakes etc. However, a few `days' later, he learns that this kind of lifestyle can give him no satisfaction. Eventually, after experiencing many groundhog days, Phil realises that principles such as compassion, integrity and goodwill provide the deeper kind of contentment and satisfaction which he seeks. Once he grows to this stage of maturity, his groundhog-day-cycles come to an end, and he lives happily ever after. Sounds like Heaven? Too right.
0553212478|4.0|All my life I have heared and seen movies about Dracula, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde. Normally I do not read horror/ science fiction but I was curious about these three and decided to find out how these literary characters attained such long lasting lives. The time spent reading the three books was worth it. It was an entertaining cultural experience.<br /><br />I'll leave it to the experts to try to tell you why they are classics. I don't know, but if you are always short on time, like I am, my order of preference is as listed in the first sentance above.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta set out to go beyond the boundaries and not to stick to any particular genre and break all the rules of music once Cedric and Omar split from At The Drive-In. They have done just that and more with their debut album De-Loused in the Comatorium. Now, Frances The Mute is an even wilder ride to the center of one's mind then before, although it does have a looser base of inspiration than the debut, it is much more impressive for me. I know now that i would go to the end of the earth to see their live show. This album makes me crave to know what they have in their heads for the next album.

B0007O38F8|5.0|once again a cd comes out with so much hype so many expectations and so many haters! yall know if you bought this cd today and hadnt heard all the tracks on the internet a month ago you would love it. The reason everyone loved \\"get rich or die tryin\\" is cus no one heard 50 before and realized how gangsta he is. now yur so obsessed you get his cd before he finishes it and tell him it sucks. You should stop the hate cus you all bought it and you know if you look at the track list and never heard any of them there would be 10 at least that you'd replay over and over. Give him a break, dre needs his best for detox and em spent his best on pac (that other cd we all got to early, fire). Tracks like Toy soldier, Gunz Come Out, Piggy Bank, Im Suposed to Die Tonight- are fire, ive made love to candy shop and the other night \\"just a lil bit\\" came on in my car and I hopped on the hood while i was driving and started rappin while my passenger had to grab the wheel. Thats how hot that song was when i first heard it in my car, it's the knock. So stop hating and love it. By the way fifty, since its game over you got room for a west coast rapper?
B00005JNBQ|1.0|When a movie is billed as a \\"Hilarious Independent Film,\\" one calls to mind something (something most recently) like \\"Super Troopers.\\"  That movie was hilarious in at least more than one spot.  I only laughed out loud once.  The rest were sad chuckles at a movie trying too hard to be funny.  This movie is unique, I will give it that.  But I can't imagine watching this movie again.  Once was enough.
B0007O38F8|1.0|This album simple blows. The flow and delivery of the lyrics is a laugh. What makes it worse is that they dont even match the beats.    Most of the beats suck, the lyrics arent even up to par, and the chorus kills like 60%+ of the songs. Sorry 50 had something going with Get Rich but now he hit the pavement. Atleast he didnt use Lifes on the Line and Aint Like Me on this CD too like on the last 3 LPs hes dropped.
B000002H6C|5.0|After 3 previous releases under Metallica's belt, Hetfield and company returned with an album that went much deeper lyrically and musically.  During the 'Puppets' tour in Scandinavia, bassist Cliff Burton was tragically killed as the band's tour bus overturned. He was replaced by Jason Newstead.  And Justice For All proved to be an album that vented out anger, sorrow and pain from the death of their former 4-string headbanger.<br /><br />And Justice For all starts a little different than the previous albums with leads that progressively get louder until the listener hears riffs that Metallica were famous for!  The song, Blackened is a perfect opener.  Hetlfield's voice is particulary strong on this song.  One of Metallica's strongest ballads ever written is 'One.'  This song is a very emotional song about the horrors of war.  The best song here in my opinion is Harvester of Sorrow.  The riffs are amazing and I am finding myself head banging to this song all the time!  Hammet's lead sounds magnificent halfway through the song.  The track, To Live is to Die, is one of the most emotional instrumentals ever written.  This song is nearly 10 minutes long, and it was dedicated to Cliff.  He even wrote the short poem spoken by Hetfield near the end of the song.  The leads will pull at your heart in this one.<br /><br />Metallica has another 5-star album with And Justice For All.  This is some of Metallica's most aggressive material musically and lyrically.  After this album, the band never has really sounded like this.  Their music was not as heavy, the songs became shorter, and mainstream was pointing their fingers to Ulrich, Hetfield and the rest of the Bay Area Bashers.  One wonders what sort of legacy Metallica would've had if they kept on playing material similar to And Justice For All.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Seems like in the past couple weeks, people have really started to hate on 50, and thats going to happen when he is opening in mouth, in the news and on air. But whatever your opion, go Cop this new 50, and you honestly tell me that it's not just as hot as Get Rich or Die Tryin'. <br />   I've also herd alot of people tryin to dis, cause the album isn't full of Dr. Dre. Well take a listen and you'll see that 50 is 50, not dre's 50, not Em's 50. I feel that he could lace anything and make it hot, North, South East or West, 50 will make it Hot. <br />    So if you have any Doubts, DON'T. Go get it, put it in the player, and i bet it doesn't leave for Days. Don't Forget to check out Piggy Bank, I Supposed to Die Tonight, Gatman and Robbin, and also Get in my Car produced by Hi-Tek. <br />   <br />
B0007O38F8|2.0|First thing that came to mind after hearing this album.....sellout???? 50 what are you doing?? i really like 50 and love g-unit, but this cd is bad. What is with all the corny songs on here, its not the 50 i used to know. I dont like the first 2 singles which are \\"disco inferno\\" and \\"candy shop\\", they are nothing compared to \\"wanksta\\" and \\"in da club\\". I guess he is happier making money and making songs for ladies instead of making good music. You can tell \\"disco inferno\\" was made to be a single and it sounds like every other stupid club song. <br /> <br />    Whats kind of funny is he made fun of Ja rule for doing this, and now he is doing the same thing. I loved Ja Rule when his first cd dropped, then he did every other song with ashanti and fell off. 50 dissed the hell out of him for it, but is now doing the same thing. songs like \\"build you up\\", \\"god gave me style\\", \\"so amazing\\", these songs are just horrible and i dont know what he was thinking.  <br /> <br />  \\"Piggy bank\\" this song might be the worst diss record i have ever heard, he doesnt even really trash them that bad. I love diss records no matter if i like the person or not, because they are just amazing, But this one was horrible the only thing he could say is Nas, Jadakiss and fat joe dont sell records, and 50 did. Big deal, they didnt sell themsleves out to 14 year old girls, thats why they dont sell 10 million records. They all stayed true to the street. <br /> <br />   I give this album a 2 because i am not the type of person to give it a 1 if its bad and a 5 if i like it. i dont give out 5's and 1's very often, they are rare, but this album comes close just because of how good his last album was. <br /> <br />    There are a couple good tracks on the cd, the whole thing isnt a waste but it isnt worth the money. \\"gunz come out\\" is my favorite track and \\"i'm supposed to die tonight\\" is also good. <br />but to me a good cd is one that can be listened to the whole way, this cannot, i skip to those songs and a couple more but thats it. im sorry folks, but this one is bad. <br /> <br />   <br />
B000001E18|2.0|I am a big fan of the band, but this CD is in my opinion a low point. It is not terrible with songs like the title track and \\"Dirty Day\\" as my stand outs, but the rest of the album just doesn't stand out. U2 was moving toward more electronic music and away from some of the passion that makes this band great. I think that this is this CD's downfall. I was glad to see the follow up discs take a new direction. I admire the band's willingness to try new things, but this just didn't do it for me.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I wish I would have gotten a different edition, this one is pretty crappy, any way, This is a great movie, with memorable lines like Im not even supposed to be here today, or The salsa shark, or 36 *****, any way, you will have to see it to know what Im talking about, This is probably my favorite Smith film. Buy the DVD, but don't get this edition, get the Clerks X version, It's a set, plus MUCH better picture... my friend has that version, Ok later
B000002MX7|5.0|i have loved Chaka Khan since I was 4 years old.  I can remember her albums with Rufus and the Naughty album inn 1980-81.  My mother listened to her all the time.  I saw her in concert in July 2004 and she was great and so personable with the crowd.   If you love Chaks, you should defintely enjoy this CD.
B000002BQK|5.0|This is just an incredible album all the way through! Mariah prooves herself once again an incredible artist. <br /> <br />She can sing, she can write and produce so amazingly well!  This is highly recommended as part of you CD collection.  It will blow you away!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This is the first Judas Priest album with Rob Halford since Painkiller, and after two very bad cds with Tim Owens, They are right back to doing what they do best, and that is making great metal.  Every song on this cd is good.  Don't get the duel disc version, spend the couple extra bucks, and pick up this one.   <br />
B0000067L2|5.0|Expect a lot more than just Sunshine of Your Love. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best tracks on the album, but there is so much more. The greatest songs I can confidently say are Strange Brew, SOYL, World of Pain, Blue Condition, Tales of Brave Ulysees, SWLABR, and Outside Women Blues. The blues covers are mediocre, but fun to listen to. The use of wa guitar effects is present in SWLABR, where the sound is beyond warped. Cream had some of their best material on this album. I suggest regardless of what kind of music you like, to get this album.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I really didn't like this CD when it came out several years ago. <br />After the disapointing Zooropa I really felt the band had stalled. I went back and revisted this disc this year and was blown away. Some of the tracts are really ground breakers for the band. Like many U2 discs, the songs are not instant hits and really need to be listened to several times. This disc is edgy (excuse the pun) and urban in sound. \\"Do you feel loved?\\" \\"Gone\\" and \\"Wake up Dead Man\\" are my tops on this CD although there are few fillers here. This CD stnads out as a unique U2 offering. It's worth the revisit.

B0007O38F8|1.0|This one of the worst hip hop albums I have ever heard.  The Game's album was 1000x better than this garbage.  Don't buy this album, go buy some 2pac if you want some real rap.  GRODT was 1,000,000x better than this sorry sophomore release.
B000001IPL|5.0|Albums like The Offspring's Smash show that punk is still alive.  It's polished enough to be enjoyed by all music fans and rough enough to be enjoyed by listeners of the hardcore punk scene.  After selling out to Columbia records, their music went on a steady decline, slowly moving away from their punk roots and joining the \\"alternative radio\\" scene.  Their older work is less polished and is difficult for people to get into who aren't punk fans.  Smash is a golden album that will be remembered for generations.  I also recommend Ixnay on the Hombre with Smash.  It's like Smash but less popular.
B00001OH7P|5.0|What can I say about this album? There's so many things I could, but I am without the words. There is a raw emotion and connection when Bowie sings \\"Five Years,\\" \\"Soul Love,\\" wait, actually, he sings the entire album that way. Five Years starts us off with maybe our first impression of Ziggy, aware of his limited time as a star. Moonage Daydream is supposed to be a song written by Ziggy. After that, Bowie takes us through every persona of Ziggy, the teen-hero, the martyr, the fool, and the washed-up star. After the song Ziggy Stardust ends, the album seems to be speeding up and running out of time. You won't even have to look at the track listings to know that Rock n' Roll Suicide is the last song. Then we know that Ziggy's time is over, but life moves on, and it always does.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Who would have thought that the best disc of this decade so far would belong to Green Day? Yes, I said decade. I am just a luke warm fan of the band (I think I have an old cassette of Dookie collecting dust somewhere) but this CD stands out in a world of MP3 players and Ipods. This disc demands to be listened to from beginning to the end. Like many of the theme records of the 1970's this rock opera is outstanding. It echoes of the Who's Tommy, but it is distinctly Green Day. The band has kept the punk edge while bringing the music to a new level. The rhytham changes and the moods of each song are so well thought out that one can not help being sucked into the world of American Idiot. Those those few that are crying about Green Day selling out, maybe its just that many now know what a just a few knew before, this is a great band.
B000000P17|5.0|over the years there have been alot of cds but this is 1 of the bests.this cd is special because it was the last guns cd with the original cast.if youre a guns n roses fan you have to buy this cd. <br />since i dont have you  10/10 <br />new rose  8.5/10 <br />down on the farm  9.5/10 <br />human being  8.5/10 <br />raw power  7/10 <br />aint it fun  9/10 <br />buick mackane  8.5/10 <br />hair of the dog  9/10 <br />attitude   10/10 <br />black leather  9.5/10 <br />you cant put your hands around a memory  9/10 <br />i dont care about you  10/10 <br />the original guns n roses are over but its the start of something big.....the chinese democrasy
B00009V7T2|5.0|My Gawd.  I'm reliving my Pink floyd-Yes-King Crimson-Gong-  <br />Camel-Magma-induced dayze of the 70's.  What a refreshing  <br />inspiration stemming from great prog rock bands of the past.   <br />Can't wait to see The Mars Volta live.
B000002BPS|5.0|Ixnay on the Hombre is my favorite Offspring album.  It has the traditional hardcore sound from their older albums like Smash and Ignition and the lyrics are very amazing.  Don't think it's \\"just another major label release\\" because it's on Columbia records.  It was originally put out on Epitaph, Brett Gurewitz's indie label, but the rights to the CD ended up being sold to Columbia records.  Apparantly there was a fight between Brett and The Offspring and it ended on bad terms.  The Offspring went on to make several more albums on Columbia that haven't been as hardcore as their older work.  This album is like a second banana to Smash, and I strongly recommend buying it.
B000002UAR|5.0|I want to start out by saying I detest accusations that this album is primarily drug-based. Sure, the Beatles were in a time in history when the public had begun to experiment with lsd, and they did write some of their material out of psychadelic experiences. What I'm trying to point out is that if you look at the complexity and creativeness of their first album, to this album, you have an evolution that took 4 years and produced one of the greatest albums ever recorded, and would maybe not have been possible without the presence of lsd. Stop looking at the drugs they used as they way they became creative, but as one of the many experiences that shape and mold song-writers to become better.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I bought this CD even though i read all those bad reviews and after listening to each song in a good mood, i all of a sudden was down! This album is most likely aimmed to boost young teenager sales like 13 years old.  <br /> <br />1st album off the hook, goes in HISTORY as album you can put 1 and listen the entire way through. Pick it up \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" <br /> <br />This ALBUM and alot of EMiNEMs productions are awful! First time i bought a 2pac CD and took it out of the CD-PLAYER after 3 days was when EMiNEM got his hands on them. Hes RICH and Hes WHITE and he is taking over what BLACK MEN have created just like every other white man in this world. (BY THE WAY, I\\"M WHITE)  <br /> <br />So GOOD LUCK finding music to bump to in your RIDE and lets hope some new stars get into the game because RAPPING is a sport and some people need to retire legends then go out LOSERS!  Peace

B0007TKH66|5.0|Number 1:I AM a Star Trek fan<br />Number 2:I WILL buy this when it comes out!<br />Number 3:Star Trek:The Next Generation is the BEST TREK EVER!!!<br />Number 4:'Broken Bow' was not Star Trek's best pilot.<br />Number 5:This is 'Enterprise''s most exciting season to me.<br />  This is a prequal to Star Trek that,at this time didn't even have those words as part of it's name-it was only called 'Enterprise'.It takes place aboard a flat starship in the mid 22'nd century with less then 80 people on board.The crew have a good chemistry but are more timid and uncertain then the brave Trek characters we've come to know,especially Scott Bakula's Captain Jonathan Archer who always seems unsure wheather to leap forward or backward.These people on 'Enterprise' live in a world without holodecks,deflector shields or even a dependable transporter.They ride around in Shuttle Pods alot and frequently where space suits.My favorite during this season?I have a couple-\\"Terra Nova\\" because the humans seen in that show make the Enterprise crew seem LESS self doubting.The other would be \\"Two Days And Two Nights\\" about the first human visit to Risa and the season ends with the great shocking cliffhanger \\"Shockwave\\",the first one a Star Trek series included in it's first season.So at first I was a little put off by 'Broken Bow',whitch is overlong and has sections that are painfully dull but as the season progressed so did the quality.But this is about as good as this gets because in upcomming years Enterprise became incredibly tedious to the point that it had to serialize it's entire third season to keep people's attention and was ultimately cancelled.As of this writing the series finale hasn't yet aired but Enterprise has gone down as the shortest lives series in the francise since the original show in 1966,clocking in at only four seasons.This might have worked magnificantly as a miniseries or a Star Trek television movie but didn't always live up to the promise of this first year.Sadly the reality of 9/11 intruded coldly on this series pilot and in the coming years people have been glued more to the news and reality TV then good ol' Star Trek.Has Trek gotton worse?No-regular network television has and without the mass public interest to back it up this show was almost doomed from the start.So I rate this highly because of the quality FX duty done,the overall historical look of the show and the sense of continuity-not to mention that considering having little reference to go by the starship NX-01 itself is one of Trek's most clever spaceship designs and is ammong my all time favorites.Character developement and writing seem to be the fatal flaw of Enterprise at times and these episodes are as good as it gets in that department.So is this worth the investment?I say yes.y of 9/11 intruded coldly on this series pilot and in the coming years people have been glued more to the news and reality TV then good ol' Star Trek.Has Trek gotton worse?No-regular network television has and without the mass public interest to back it up this show was almost doomed from the start.So I rate this highly because of the quality FX duty done,the overall historical look of the show and the sense of continuity-not to mention that considering having little reference to go by the starship NX-01 itself is one of Trek's most clever spaceship designs and is ammong my all time favorites.Character developement and writing seem to be the fatal flaw of Enterprise at times and these episodes are as good as it gets in that department.So is this worth the investment?I say yes.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Finally, I can talk about this CD without having to mention the useless crap called Dual Discs that won't even play in most CD Players, and the scam that it really is. <br /> <br />Anyways back to the PRIEST music here:  This CD is not bad at all.  It is SO MUCH better than the \\"Turbo\\" and \\"Ram it Down\\" CDs ever were. <br /> <br />It is hard to say about this CD.  It is not bad at all, but it just isn't as outstanding as the \\"Painkiller\\" CD. <br /> <br />I see this CD as a 2000's version of the \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" CD.  Imagine if the \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" CD was made in 2005 instead of back in the late 70's when it first came out, and you have the \\"Angel of Retribution\\" CD from PRIEST. <br /> <br /> <br />Check out the songs on this CD: <br />1.  Judas Rising <br />2.  Deal with the devil <br />3.  Demonizer <br />4.  Wheels of Fire <br />5.  Hellrider <br />6.  Lockness (although the chorus part is really good and really catchy, but the song takes awhile to get used to). <br /> <br />I see some Painkiller influences here and there on some songs on this CD, but overall it isn't as kick-butt as the \\"Painkiller\\" CD was.   <br /> <br />For many of the songs on this CD, neither do K.K. or Glen have shredding guitar solos like they did on the \\"Painkiller\\" CD, but once in awhile on this CD you will hear some shredding but it isn't much, or even 1/2 as much as it was on the \\"Painkiller\\" CD. <br /> <br /> <br />Man, just face it:  The \\"Painkiller\\" CD is the best PRIEST CD ever made.  \\"Angel of Retribution\\" is not bad at all, but it is no \\"Painkiller\\" either. <br /> <br />If you are expecting a \\"Painkiller part 2\\" CD, keep looking elsewhere, because this surely isn't it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000001IQH|3.0|If you like Rancid, this is their best album.  I only gave it three stars because Rancid isn't very good.  The all time best song by them is \\"Journey to the end of the east bay\\".  This song is one of the only reasons this CD is any good at all.  I also like \\"Time Bomb\\",and \\"Ruby Sono\\".  NOFX is so much better though.  If you like Rancid, get hooked on NOFX.  They are ten times better.  Take my advice. NOFX rules!
B0007O38F8|5.0|The album is raw save for 2 or 3 songs, as for the beef with jada, nas, and fat joe, piggy bank was just a warning shot, wait till the responce to the responce, OVER! <br /> <br />But besides that some noteworthy tracks are: In my hood, Im suppose to die tonight, Candy Shop, Gatman, Get in My car, Gunz come out, Toy soldier, I don't need em <br /> <br />To me the worst track is the Dre produced Out of control. <br /> <br />my 50 cents
B0007O38F8|3.0|I've listened to this album a few times, but its way too long and more importantly has too many garbage tracks.  If 50 decided to reduce the number of tracks this album would be pretty hot, but instead I find my self switching thru all the crap to find the few good tracks.  Please playas.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Saw isn't as good as the trailers make it look, but it's still a pretty darn good horror flick. <br /> <br />The basic idea of the movie is that you've got two guys chained to opposite sides of a really dirty bathroom, and there's a dead guy laying in a pool of blood in the middle of the room. Neither of them have any idea how they got there or why they would be there. <br /> <br />In the course of trying to find a way to escape, they begin to discover clues and we start to learn about both characters via flashbacks. We all know they have a saw and that it won't cut through the chains, only their flesh. Is that the only possible way out? You know I can't answer that question. In fact, there's not much more of the story that I can really talk about safely. <br /> <br />The only actor you've likely seen before it Danny Glover, and some of the other actors aren't quite up to par during some scenes. We know they are supposed to be expressing horror or terror in some scenes, but it sure looks like they are trying not to laugh. That's ok though, the situations and ideas behind this movie make up for those types of shortcomings. Special effects? Eh, not so hot. There are some really cool sets, but the blood/gore factor isn't nearly as high as we had hoped. You're gonna have to use your imagination on some things. Lack of a budget or purposeful decision by the director? I'm going with the lack of budget argument. <br /> <br />One thing this movie does exceptionally well, and this is why it's getting 4 stars instead of 3, is setting you up on who the bad guy really is. They throw out some obvious fakers, and some subtle hints on others so you think you have it all figured out. Then WHAM, nope, wasn't that guy... what about?... WHAM... nope, not him, what about... you get the idea. Did I figure out the ending in advance? Yes, but not until right up til the end, and these days that deserves a boost in the ratings. <br /> <br />This one isn't for the squeamish even though it'snot as graphic as others would like you to think. I do recommend seeing it on the big screen, and if you take a date with you you can expect lots of arm squeezing and head ducking. Come to think of it, that also might be worth another star.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I'm really giving him the benefit of 2 stars. There is only like 2 good trax on this album other than the one's they're playing out on the radio and on tv. You cannot even say anything about Hate it or Love it Remix, Its a REMIX! So that one doesn't count. In total out of 22 trax 4 are good, not counting the remix, and in my opinion this is WEAK!!! I listened to this album on the internet and I know I'm not buying it! I may download some of the trax, but the album sucks. I'm not hating because I'm a G-Unit fan, but all of their works as of late is basura (traslation: GARBAGE!). Buck, Banks, and now 50's. The only respectable work is The Game's LP. All of G-Unit need to follow Dre and Em's Leadership. Now that 50 has an ego problem he thinks he can make it on his own. 50 was nothing before he came to Aftermath and will be nothing if he leaves. Oh ya this isn't a sophmore album for him either for all you so called hip hop heads, this is like his 5th album, he still had a major label before Aftermath so this ain't no sophomore jinx. This is just a crappy album. And the man said he took his time on this one! HA HA HA, he took his time to make something mediocre. Please 50 get off the steriods and make good music again.
B0007O38F8|2.0|Firstly, I wouldn't burn a bootlegged copy of this album on a stolen CDR.  Yes, that's how bad it is!  Some say his rapping style sounds like he's out of breath or that it's due to the bullets he took.  Whatever it is, it does not work.  50 raps without ANY emotion.    In every other \\"song\\", sounds of guns being cocked and bullets being fired attempt to present 50 as being hard.  Yet, the only thing that's hard is being able to sit through all the tracks of this garbage.    While listening to him, I await him to stumble over his words.  Listen closely and you can hear his speech slow as he pronounces words with three or more syllables.  Seriously, he sounds like he's learning to read for the first time-slowly pronouncing every word.  Save your money on this one folks.
B000068OCS|3.0|When I first viewed this film (and I've left my original review intact, below), I REALLY didn't like it. In fact, I pretty much hated it, and gave it one star.<br /><br />I happened to see that it was playing on commercial-free television this evening and decided to take another look. I'm glad I did. While it is not now one of my favorite films, I'm going to go halfway to great and up my rating to three stars.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure why I enjoyed it this time. Perhaps I was less distracted; maybe I was in a better frame of mind... but the net result is that my opinion of the film has changed.<br /><br />I found many of the scenes to be fairly interesting. For some reason, the quality-control lady in the Twinkie factory pulling what I assume to be \\"bad\\" Twinkies from the assembly line, somehow struck a chord with me. In this sped-up scene, the woman working appeared to be getting a rather aerobic workout as she grabbed the snacks and placed them into a discard area. However, she was still rather overweight. I couldn't help but think that perhaps her life was \\"out of balance\\" because she wasn't discarding ALL of the malformed Twinkies.<br /><br />I also had to up my review because an anonymous reader of my original review had let me know that her dad was in the movie... a scene in NYC when a number of people were emerging from an elevator. I exchanged a couple of e-mails with this nice lady, and in viewing the film again... I think I spotted her dad! It might be kind of stupid --this is a COMPLETE stranger to me-- but in a weird way, it made the film a tiny bit more personal.<br /><br />If you want to read my original review, please read on...<br /><br />..................................<br />THE ORIGINAL REVIEW.... ENTITLED,<br /><br />\\"PAINFUL\\"<br /><br />Well, I might be bucking the trend of glowing reviews for this 22-year-old \\"arthouse\\" flic, but here goes:<br /><br />While I recognize that the production was ahead of its time in 1982, and elements have been imitated over and over again --with very good results-- by many other filmmakers, I cannot in good conscience recommend this film.<br /><br />When my wife and I sat down to watch it, we honestly didn't know what to expect. I had *heard* of the film, but didn't know what it was about. With apologies to Seinfeld, it is basically about nothing. Yes, it starts out with dramatic footage of beautiful scenery overlayed with some haunting music (Native Americans chanting \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" over and over again), but my FIRST comment to my wife was: \\"This looks like file footage.\\"<br /><br />In my attempt to watch the movie without knowing anything about it first, I hadn't realized that it was 22 years old. It looked like file footage because it WAS essentially file footage. More to the point, the cinematography looks dated.<br /><br />As the film continues, the beautiful natural scenery is supplemented by scenes that have been dramatically sped up, or dramatically slowed down... images of human activity are generally shown sped up. While some of these scenes were effective in conveying the idea of \\"Life Out of Balance\\" (which is what \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" means), I thought that most of them were way too drawn out.<br /><br />As for the soundtrack, unlike most people I absolutely love ambient electronic music. Most of the time. But not in this film.<br /><br />Finally, I'll just say that my negative opinion of this film has nothing to do with a general dislike of 'artsy' films.

B00005JN4H|4.0|You have to admit that the previews make this movie look pretty stupid. I mean seriously, a taxi cab with Super-Pursuit mode? But, it did show a potential for car chases and babes, so we gave it a shot, and boy are we glad we did! <br /> <br />The movie starts off with some great bike riding, and we're not talking Jesse James bikes here, we're talking about a courier on a bicycle riding through the streets (and stores and subways) of New York City . This courier turns out to be Belle (Queen Latifah) who amazingly enough looked a lot thinner when doing all those bike stunts... anyway, Belle is finishing up her last day as a courier as she's starting a new career as a taxi driver. <br /> <br />Turns out Belle is a bit of a gearhead, and apparently an electronics wiz, design guru, bodywork genius and professional driver as well amazing that the only job she's held up to this point is as a courier. After strapping a supercharger to her taxi before turning in for the night, Belle is ready for her first day at work. The first passenger we see her take is a bossy white dude who wants to get from Time Square to the Airport in 15 min. No problem of course as this taxi would put KITT to shame. A panel pops up out of the console, bodywork changes before our eyes, the wheels change and she attaches a MOMO racing wheel to the steering column. Time to drive! OK, it's really silly but darn amusing to watch happen. Of course she makes it, scaring the crap out of her passenger in the process. <br /> <br />Next up is Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) who is about to screw up a bust. Wait? Did I just spoil the movie for you? Could it be possible that the detective in the movie isn't a screwup at the beginning of the movie who will just happen to save the day by the end? Nah, you knew all that already, you're a guy. So Washburn screws things up and in the process has his drivers license taken away. The next time we see him he hears a radio call for officers to respond to a bank robbery. He's only a couple of blocks away, but doesn't have a car. He's young and appears in good shape, so of course he grabs a taxi for those two blocks. Yes, it's Belle. <br /> <br />From this point on Belle and Washburn are reluctant partners trying to solve a bank robbery. All typical buddy-cop stuff, but it's very well done. Why on earth did this one get 4 stars? Well, the car chases are very well done, the humor is consistent, and there's a priceless girl-girl moment that moved it from 3 to 4 stars. <br /> <br />Give it a go, you'll have a good time.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I am not biased but this album simply sucks! I listen to it about ten times already and it did not grow on me whatsoever!  Lyrically, 50 has gotten weak! He doesn't seem to be hungry anymore. He still beefing with Ja Rule with that Irving Jeffry back of the album cover artwork. It's pointless to keep beating on a dead dog! The beef is dead man! Stop basing your success on record sales! Everyone wants to go platinum but some of the best lyricist always sell less than commerial rappers. Selling 10 million records do not make you better than Scarface, Nas, or any other artist.  I don't think he will come back with another GRODT caliber album. <br />Piggybank is a b***h song! Why do a diss record on people who associate themselves with Ja Rule and they did a song about their hometown (not a diss song on you)? <br />Gatman and Robbin' is aiight if you like Eminem's wack ass beats! <br />Hate It Or Love It Remix is good. <br />Nothing else spectacular or amazing on the rest of the album.
044024157X|4.0|I'll be honest, this is the first Grisham book I've read.  I though it was a great book, as far as a novel depicting a character and a town, and the changes that both go through over time.  However, it wasn't what I expected with my first Grisham novel.  The main point of the book was not the murder which happens in the first 20 pages.  I will make this comparison:  If the film \\"A Time To Kill\\" is an exact representatin of the book, and you enjoyed reading the book, then \\"The Last Juror\\" is one you want to stay away from
0316172324|3.0|Like The Tipping Point, Blink has a very simple point which it elaborates from a variety of perspectives.  In this case, the point is that our subconscious mind can integrate small, subtle clues to very quickly make great decisions . . . as long as we have been trained to know what clues to focus on.<br /><br />In developing that simple idea, Mr. Gladwell makes the case for \\"going with your gut\\" in many instances . . . especially when time is of the essence (such as during emergencies and in combat).  He also rescues analysis to show how analysis can train people to know what to look for so they can use their instincts more effectively.<br /><br />But instincts have a downside.  Based on conditioning, we make associations that are harmful to ourselves and to others.  He recounts how an innocent man became a victim of under trained, over stimulated police officers and how even African-Americans display prejudice against African-Americans.<br /><br />Most of the book is devoted to looking at prejudice and how to overcome it.  For those who are interested in that subject, this book will be much more interesting than for those who want to understand how to improve their decision-making.<br /><br />I thought that the book failed to reach the average mark as a book about how to improve decision-making.  There's no real guidance for what we can each do to improve our important decisions.  We are just left with hope that we can do better.  I graded the book up a bit because I liked the insights into racism.<br /><br />I thought the material on branded products was much too long and didn't add anything to what I knew already.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell writes well, though, so it's mostly a pleasant trip in the book.  He makes science more interesting, but leaves a bit too much of the science out to make the results satisfying.  He's writing for a dumbed-down audience with science backgrounds at the 8th grade level.<br /><br />The book's opening made me feel like I was really going to learn something.  As the book continued, I found myself disappointed compared to the high expectations that the opening set for learning better decision-making practices.  As a result, all I got from the book was to pay attention to external clues and my own physiological cues as I react to a situation.  I already do that, so I felt that the book didn't really deliver a solid benefit to me beyond teaching me a few new stories about decision makers.ke I was really going to learn something.

B00068NVI4|5.0|There was a time when Yes seemed to have forgotten their classical songs. Every time I bought a DVD, I knew I would have to sit through \\"And you and I\\" and \\"I've seen good people\\" again. I love these songs believe me. But on every DVD, there would be only two or three new classical songs. Now they seem to be understanding that they have to go back to those songs which made Yes one of the best Rock groups ever. We've been throght the 80's and the 90's and when we look back we see nothing of great impact has been done in terms of Rock. We had \\"The Police\\", Maybe \\"U2\\", but good, intelligent, pop and creative music mixed up with quality and great musicians has not been found. Of course, we had King Crimson. The reason why I did not mention this other great band was just because I find Yes more popular. Maybe I'm wrong. But the thing is that Yes looked back and probably they had it figured out , \\"My God! The songs we composed in the past were one of the best things made in terms of rock music ever.\\" Let's go back to it and sell, make money, have fun...\\" And I would say they are right. I admit and hope millions of Yes fans agree with me : They still have some old rarities left : Sound Chaser, To be Over (Steve Howe; instrumental); Dear Faher; Don't Kill the Whale; Parallells and maybe some more. Every time I saw a Yes DVD I wondered, \\"Where's \\"South Side of the Sky\\" ? It was released in \\"Acoustic\\" and it is relealed again now. Thank God. I just hope that they do not keep releasing the same songs over and over. I agree that some songs are worth listening to a new version.I'm a little tired of seeing good people, but what Yes did now I take my hats off. Congratulations. As I always end a Yes review : Remember, Yes.Not only rock fans like Yes, but also musicians.
B0007O38F8|3.0|Gotta admit that I'm only listening to the album about twice through, trying to appreciate things I heard on the disappointing first listen. It's apparent this is defintely not \\"Get Rich\\" which was, despite all, a GOOD album. But it also took fiddy out the streets, alienating his core street level cats such as myself. It's not \\"Get rich\\" cuz its 50 now that he is famous, but it's not quite as good either. I ain't looking for 50 to go back to \\"Guess who's Back\\" ish. I appreciate good music but he sounds like that fame just hit hard! and thats all gravy, just that 50 can be a dope lyricist if he so chooses...granted with the bullethole slur but whateva. I ain't mad at 50 for blowing i just want good music. Employing some of the bets beatmakers today, Dre n Em included of course, this is the 50 he always wanted to be coming up...LARGE. Mostly there are some hot club bangaz but gone are the intensity of that hungry, don't stop till i blow cat. Well he blew alright, but he just formula rap as far as i know. The Scott Storch track \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" is a banger both club n street, but employing Mr. Jamie foxx to sing the hook on \\"Build u up\\" is plain...WACk is the word? It ain't a \\"Slow Jam\\", that was Foxx's ONe moment in music. He a great actor but singer he ain't, RAY was incredible Jamie but doin a song wit 50? Uh huh. Besides Scott Storch production, Needlz blesses the track \\"God Gave me style\\" with a soulful boom bip, and 50 does the slow drawl nicely. Not to diss Em's production, which is think is top notch, the Em produced and co starr on \\"Gatamn n Robin\\" is also wack. So what can be said? There are some hot joints but 50's style is kinda old at this point, and it rubs off all over the album. For those who might be peepin for it, there is no \\"In Da club 2\\" but \\"Candy Shop\\" ain't bad either. The best things for me about the album are the track with Buckwild, one of the best, most underrated producers ever! And \\"Piggy Bank\\" yeah the dis track. I must admit it amuzes me to see who 50 is diggin into these days, and the answer these days are dang everybody!! the already famous track goes at half of Ny, or at least the mc's on \\"New york, NY\\" Jada, Joe Crack and of course...Jeffrey! 50 always made hot diss tracks and this is no exception, i just think he going at everybody for the wrong reason. But now that he opened that can of worms it'll be interesting to see who fires what back. I know Kiss could easily slime 50 in a battle so who cares that he can't break 850,000, which is 50's claim in the song? As for Fat Joe he can't rhyme all too well but he gotta appear \\"hood' he has that obligation to the X...hahaha! One thing has not changed, people are gonna hate on 50 and he gon hate em right back. I just heard that 50 fired Game for \\"disloyalty??\\" Don't know whats up but 50's prodigy could surpass his mentor and thats just a fact. Game got skills and his album, if anything, is the hottest G Unit got to offer right now. Oh yeah, and Olivia's booty!            <br />
B0007O38F8|2.0|This album is over 20 tracks of absolute garbage.  Some beats are nice, but the lyrical content is so elementary.  He should have had  more guest appearances to help him out lyrically.  He'll still go multi-platinum but eventually it's going to get old...just like Eminem.
B0007O38F8|3.0|First off I will say I love Fifftie and all but this album is a let down from the first. I mean for him to top the first would have been almost impossible and with Dre focusing most of his energy into the Game's Cd, 50 had to go to outside sources to get beats. Some of them do him justice and some of them don't. Either or, to me it took the shine off of a highly anticipated album and leaves it lacklustered. There are a few tracks on here that are HOTT don't get me wrong, but its just not the caliber that I expected from his 2nd attempt. The album isn't a wash but its far from excellent like so of the reviews I read thus far. If you were expecting the same 50 that gave you \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\", don't look for it in this album. You will get more singing, more clubby tracks and less edgier mood from beat to beat. Piggy Bank which is hott on the stations and over the web will give you a false impression that the whole album is like that. Its not. Just my humble opinion. 50 once said recently that if he doesn't top his 10 million sales on this album he will consider it a failure. 50 dawg...u failed! But at least its still decent ryding music for what its worth.
B00000IIXH|3.0|If you are a fan of Bruce then you will find this cd to be good for an occasional listen.  Especially the tracks from 11 - 18.  The first part of the album is filled with songs that really didn't make the cut with good reason.  They are subpar.  But starting with the inspired \\"Pink Cadillac\\" the songs get much, much better.  \\"Fever\\" is wonderfully infectious and conjures up visions of a funky old bar with the musicians playing just for the fun of it.  \\"The Promise\\" is worth the cost of the cd alone.
B0007P3582|5.0|producer Scott Storch did allot on this album making 3 of the hottest tracks which are \\"jus a little bit\\"\\"candy shop\\"and \\"build you up\\"....the Lp starts to get good around track 5 which is \\"piggyBank\\"..Tony yayo(16 bar) killed the track \\"my toy soildier\\"... oooooooooh \\"outa control\\" is the best club track i ever heard.........
B0007N1AI6|4.0|The Priest is back! But what exactly does the first album from the \\"classic\\" line-up of Halford, Tipton, Downing, Hill and Travis in 15 years have to offer? What stands out most with Angel of Retribution is that Priest are not \\"pushing the envelope\\" and/or trying to compete with younger bands as they did on Painkiller & the two CDs they did with Ripper Owens. It almost seems as if we have unreleased Priest songs that were re-recorded with a modern sound. (Speaking of which, the production for this CD is GREAT! Probably the best Priest have ever sounded.)  <br /> <br />Obviously the quality of the songs is good, but the direction isn't quite what I expected. The songs in general have a very '80s-ish quality to them, they're not as intense as they were in the '90s and beyond (for the most part). Halford doesn't scream as much as he did on some previous releases, and I think there could have been more twin harmony leads, but maybe I'm just too picky. Regardless, Glenn & K.K. shine all throughout this beast, their solos are nothing short of brilliant & their riffs are vintage, classic Priest. There's lots of double-bass drumming throught the album, Scott Travis is awesome, but it's more about the mid-tempos on this one, with a only a few faster ones.  <br /> <br />I think the chemistry is there & this line-up is incapable of making a bad album, but it's not as strong (in my opinion) as Painkiller was. My favorite song would be \\"Hellrider.\\" This is a wicked song that sticks in your head! \\"Angel\\" is a nice (power) ballad, which makes it all the more special, since Priest don't do many of these. \\"Judas is Rising,\\" \\"Deal With the Devil\\" and \\"Worth Fighting For\\" are also stand out tracks. Some songs, on the other hand, like \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and the first single \\"Revolution\\" are rather basic & not very memorable. Normally, I would be all over the 13 minute epic \\"Lochness\\" with its moody intro, and atmospheric vibe, but the main riff is basically a rip-off to the verse of theSabbath classic \\"Electric Funeral.\\" Didn't anyone notice this in the writing/recording process?  <br /> <br />Lyrically, we get standard Priest material. Not intellectual like Queensryche or Maiden, but not quite as clich/cheesy as say Manowar. I did like the fact that the titles of previous Priest songs and albums were interspersed throughout Angel of Retribution. <br /> <br />The packaging alone with its book-like format sets this album apart from your average CD. I guess it's standard for most major acts to include a Bonus DVD with their albums. What bugged me is the format of the 40 minute documentary. The way it works is that they'll show a live song 3/4 of the way, then have a 2 minute interview segment. You have the option of hearing the songs separately, so why did they have to slice the interview part into the songs if we have the option of hearing them on their own? They should have just included a separate 8-10 minute interview. The live songs are really fun to watch, they do a killer job on the old classics, which cover a wide range of the Priest catalogue. The semi-acoustic version of \\"Daimonds & Rust\\" being my personal favorite. This one sends chills down my spine!  <br /> <br />Bottom line is that it's great to hear Halford back in Priest and Angel of Retribution does have many killer songs. Not their best, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff out there. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could!
0802130208|1.0|I've heard so much about this book and was able to pick up a copy for 50 cents at a used book sale.  I'm glad that's all I spent; nothing about it engaged me.  Ignatius spends so much time playing the victim, he reminds me of people I know in real life and can't stand.  His mother's no better, clucking and fussing over him when she should be kicking him out of the house.  I stopped about a third of the way through chapter 2, they irritated me so much.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|this album just arrived today, i must say i am very impressed. I think it is even better then their debuit wich i thought was great. this album also goes much more weird and progressive wich i loved. all together its a quality album.
B0002MB7QW|2.0|The end of the world is upon us again and this time its The Day After Tomorrow which plunges the world with fierce tornadoes, basketball sized hail, a tsunami of water hitting New York and also the air gets so cold everything it touches it freezes to death. Always in movies like these there is gonna be a scientist whose gonna give some sort of speech about the world being in peril and the government laughs at him saying \\" oh it isnt gonna happen\\" and then the next minute you know that guy is being impaled by a bus. This movie has different parts of the world being plunged into the end of the world and one city is New York where there is trapped son of Dennis Quaid (Frequency, upcoming Flight Of The Pheonix), Jake Gyllenhaal (Highway, October Sky) and soon after Quaid talks to his son about whats going on, he and 2 other guys, Dash Mihok (Dark Blue, The Thin Red Line) and Jay O. Sanders (Kiss The Girls, Daylight) rush out to go and save his son and the people trapped inside the library. Meanwhile, Gyllenhaal is trying to survive with the others till his dad comes. A movie like this should of been way more better and way more, just, awesome. Only some of the disaster scenes (examples being tidal wave scene, city being frozen scenes and the flock of birds scene) are pretty cool but Dennis Quaid cant quite save this, only Gyllenhaal rises above material. It would be scary to think this would happen in real life but on the big screen it isnt that scary or interesting. Glenn Plummer (Speed, The Salton Sea) is wasted playing a homeless man and Ian Holm (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The 5th Element) as an old scientist. Also starring Emmy Russum (Mystic River, The Phantom Of The Opera), Sela Ward (The Fugitive), Nestor Serrano (Bringing Out The Dead, The Negotiator), Adrian Lester (Primary Colors), Austin Nichols and Arjay Smith. In other words folks this supposed thrilling fast paced ride is a frozen icicle of boredom
B00011D1RC|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie! The cast is exceptional.<br /><br />I instantly fell in love with Joan Crawford; I liked that she was beautiful, witty, and yet coyly aware of living outside the box. Her clothes were beautiful and complimented the art deco hotel. I really wish she would have stuck with the thin eyebrows; she was so much prettier in the 30s.<br /><br />I also fell in love with Lionel Barrymore who I have never seen in a film since that topped his performance as Kringelein. It was so easy to feel sorry for him, to love him, and to want to take care of him. He was wonderful and I really feel like the story is almost about him, not everyone together. He was sort of tied to everyone except Grusinskaya.<br /><br />Wally Beery was good as Preysing. I don't believe he was so dislikable as he thought the character to be. His scenes are actually somewhat boring. I can sympathize with Preysing though. I heard he was the only character allowed to have a German accent which was a stipulation to getting him to stay on the project.<br /><br />I hated Greta Garbo and her over-acting in the film. As a ballerina, she was somewhat believable because she was so tall, but she DID look awkward in the dress. I think that a lot of the reason why her scenes seemed so dramatic and overly played was because of the way the film was edited. There are scenes of her that begin with her violently spinning around and blurting out a dramatic line. She also cradles the phone and talks to it. And what kills me is the way she constantly furrows her forehead and those eyebrows! Egad!<br /><br />I read the book by Vikki Baum, the translation into English of course, and I really think that it is a great novel that was adapted well but stands on its own. There are so many pieces of it that cannot be translated into film. I think that maybe Garbo knowing the motives behind her character had a right to overact but because the audience did not know her thoughts did not understand her portrayal of Grusinkaya.<br /><br />I thought that John Barrymore was good enough was the Baron von Geigern although the character itself does not stand out much. It was cool to see that brothers played in the same film together.<br /><br />It seems crazy to me now that Garbo and Crawford were so childish about each other but stories about their fights make me laugh. Supposedly, Garbo hated Marlene Dietrich and tardiness about the same amount so Crawford came late to the set just to bug Garbo (which I find somewhat hard to believe because Crawford was so efficient about everything) and she also played Dietrich records loudly. The pranks they played on each other just make me laugh horribly. They were like junior high school kids.<br /><br />I do like that so many big name stars were cast together to create sort of a phenomenon. I don't like the way the system is used today because it is like people who are not famous cannot get good roles, but back then, it sort of refreshed the screen to occasionally see a film that featured many stars. The only other film I can really think of besides Grand Hotel that is noted for using this is Dinner at Eight which is sort of the answer to the success of Grand Hotel.<br /><br />The DVD is awesome; it included footage of stars attending the premiere. For an older film, any extra features are exciting. The DVD also includes a parody of the movie which was well made.ohn Barrymore was good enough was the Baron von Geigern although the character itself does not stand out much.

B0000028RR|5.0|Rage is the loudest, most powerful, and probably the best band from the 90's.  They are known for their extreme left-leaning political views, which means that about half of America will probably hate them.  But for the rest of us, the band backing zack (he's alright, even if he acted like an idiot and broke up the band!) is one of the most tight and strong bands in all of rock.  Just listen to Tom Morello's insane wizardry DJ scratching guitar riffs or Brad Wilks out of it drumming or  (my favorite) Timmy C's beyond funky bass (it really projects more than that of other modern bass players, except maybe Les Claypool).   <br /> This is all of the protest in rock and roll funneled into one band, and boy does it kick butt.  Every song on this album rocks (except I could do without maynard keenan's vocals on that one song).  It puts the pathetic imitators like Korn and Papa Roach beyond shame.  It makes them seem oblivious.  You absolutely cannot miss out on the most powerful band ever with one of the best guitarists, and this is where you should start.  Get all of their albums, every single one is rokkin.  I think that every listen will prompt you to jump in the air in amazement.
0671027344|4.0|The book \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a good book. This book was also very similar to the book \\"A Catcher in the Rye.\\" This book takes you through the life of a boy, that as you read more and more you grow to think that you know everything about him, but then after reading it you realize that you never really understood anything about him. This book has interesting characters, a descriptive plot, and a good theme to go along with all of that. I recommend this book to many readers, because it is an excellent book to read!   -Greg

B0000042HV|5.0|I considered buying the complete String Quartets of Shostakovich for some time, unable to decide if the Emerson or Borodin (minus the 14th and 15th) would be the one I wanted.  The playing of the Emerson was certainly in their favor but I settled on the Fitzwilliam String Quartet after reading a review of this set.  The Fitzwilliam may not play as well as the Emerson or have the Russian advantage of the Borodin but they have captured the emotion behind the music as no other quartet.  The Fitzwilliam also worked with Shostakovich and were given the honor of the Western premiere of the 15th Quartet, so there is an element of authority to their playing.  Throughout the set, I was impressed with the playing and depths of feeling expressed.  <br /> <br />The quartets appear in composition order on the 6 discs allowing the listener to follow how Shostakovich developed the form.  Each CD is in a paper envelop inside a box.  The accompanying booklet described each quartet and provides insight into their composition. The recordings are clear and nicely balanced, perhaps not as refined as the sound of the Emerson but certainly excellent.  I knew only three of the quartets well before I got this set, and I recommend taking the plunge and buying all of the quartets if possible.  In sum, this is a rewarding complete set that will be of interest to the listener who wants to follow Shostakovich's development of the string quartet.   <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|What looks like 2004's best buy (and polled the album of the year in Russia, incidentally!) should in all honesty be thumbed down as alternative kich, at best. It sure takes a lot to pack a special edition with illustrated album under a pricy hard cover and a DVD to boot (alas, documentary and stereo). But that's all there is to the \\"lot\\". Edge ain't no musician and Bono no singer, the way they perform -- and they hardly ever performed better. What with painy vocal and one note chord sweeps. Ever too formal to break new ground, the band goes on  riding the crest of non-existant hard core / new wave. And that fervor about society, morality and, gosh, peace! They are the Brezhnevs to the free world of rock. The hit-single tune feels borrowed (and it is!), the layout terrible, the concept phony, the title mouthful, the drawings unimaginative, the goods -- generally undelivered. And even if they were -- who cares  about the bomb dismantling know-how, anyway?
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Undeniably the best album of 2004. I picked up the CD in September and 6 months later I'm still blasting it on a near-daily basis. Emotionally sincere, heartrending, almost transcendent. Be sure to check them out in concert -- they're even better live.
0345350499|2.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley explores some very interesting ideas in 'Avalon,' but she just doesn't execute them well. \\"Sprawling\\" doesn't come close to describing this enormous tome. It seems that Bradley just couldn't decide which aspects of Arthurian legend to focus on, so she attempts to cover them all. The result is a muddled, heavily repetitive, completely self-absorbed epic that almost entirely loses sight of what should be her thesis: the demanding patriarchal Church that threatens and eventually absorbs the pagan rites of the Goddess. <br /> <br />Viewing Camelot from the eyes of the women behind the throne is an excellent  approach, and Bradley does well to simplify the family ties behind many of the characters. Unfortunately, very few of Bradley's characters are sympathetic. Guenivere (or Gwynhwyfar, as she insists on spelling it) is reduced to a vapid, terrified, ridiculously pious mouse of a woman. Lancelot is not the saintly figure with one crushingly tragic flaw he is meant to be; he's nothing more than a playboy with a guilt complex. Lancelot and Guinevere are never truly undone; they merely give up. Viviane is so self-righteous that it's impossible to relate to her. Bradley has to tell us there is a bond between 'Companions' of the Round Table and King Arthur; there is no evidence to discover that convinces us. Even Morgause's true nature is revealed too late: the plot twist she reveals at the very end deserves to have a devastating impact on the reader. Instead, not only is the twist lost in a muddle of competing elements, but the characters it affects are so unsympathetic that I simply didn't care. Only Morgaine and Arthur have redeeming qualities, but Morgaine's constant musings only test my patience. Bradley is so preoccupied with detailing every aspect of the fall of the Goddess that she seems to have entirely missed the point of what makes the characters of Arthurian legend so tragic. <br /> <br />This book came so highly recommended to me, and has so many glowing reviews on Amazon, that I'm all the more disappointed. Bradley's use of the language is clumsy and limited, and she doesn't trust the reader enough to let her themes and theories unfold by themselves. She has to spell everything out in such a heavy-handed way that there is nothing left to discover. What could have been the kernal of something fascinating is, like Avalon, 'lost in the mist.' Stick to 'The Once and Future King' by T.H. White. He tells the story so artfully and subtly that the tragedy of Arthur will hit you like a ton of bricks.
B000088E6D|5.0|How fantastic it is to have an artist around today with the caliber of talent that Michael Buble has. There would be something very important missing in music if Buble wasn't around to give us that \\"certain something.\\" With voice I can only describe as honey, so sweet and so very smooth, he presents such a huge range of emotions and feelings with ease and panache. Buble exudes sadness, glee and total romance better than anyone the world has heard since Sinatra.
0060763280|5.0|My wife and I bless T Harv Eker for turning our lives around in 2003. <br /> <br />I am flabbergasted as to why a few bitter people post such venomous attacks on him. It seems that any talk of money brings out both the best and absolute worst in people. <br /> <br />Perhaps the \\"negative nellies\\" are angry because they didn't have the strength to get off their butts and actually follow Harv's teaching? What other reason could there be for such attacks? <br /> <br />My wife and I first took Harv's Millionaire Mind Intensive back in 2003. At that point we were in dire straights. I had lost my job as a Boeing engineer a few months earlier and my wife was struggling with cancer. Our health insurance was about to run out. We were in danger of losing everything. House. Cars. Retirement savings. Everything. <br /> <br />To put it bluntly, our financial situation was critical. <br /> <br />Then my brother-in-law paid for our admission to the Millionaire Mind Intensive because it had had a huge impact on his life.  <br /> <br />We were skeptical at first but decided very quickly to attend. What did we have to lose but a weekend? <br /> <br />To make a long story short, the 3 day seminar turned our lives around. Harv went deep into our issues around money. He helped us to see how we sabotage ourselves financially. He helped us to heal our relationships with money so that we would attract and keep it instead of repelling it. <br /> <br />It was like the difference between night and day. <br /> <br />Very quickly we started taking action to correct our situation instead of just sitting on our behinds worrying and griping. Within a year things had turned around completely. By then I had started my own company and my wife had recovered enough to start a dream of hers about investing in rental properties. <br /> <br />Today we both pull in a good income. Our bills are covered and we have lots of fun money too from using Harv's incredible money management system. <br /> <br />So buy this book! Then take action and do what Harv says. <br /> <br />At the seminar two other books were also highly recommended. We bought both and it paid off big time. One is How to Own Your Home Years Sooner by Harj Gill. My wife has used it to make big dollars in real estate. The other book is only available from [...] , and I used it to start a real business on only $500. <br /> <br />Thank you Harv for your lessons and for sharing other people's lessons with us as well. <br /> <br />Ignore the nasty people and gamble the $13. You will be forever grateful that you did. <br /> <br />God bless! <br /> <br />
0440237688|5.0|When I first received this book, I thought it looked boring.  But I am so glad that I gave it a chance!  The back cover description really doesn't tell enough about the story.  But that's why I'm writing this review.  So you can know just what the story is about (free of spoilers), and my opinion on it. <br /> <br />Jonas is a boy who lives in a community where everything is structured and in control.  Babies are birthed by birthwomen, named, and given to couples with only one girl and one boy in each family.  Jobs, husbands, and wives are assigned by the leaders of the community.  Children are not allowed to ride bicycles until they are \\"a nine\\".  All of the people of the community have lives planned out for them, and they can have only as much knowledge as they are allowed.  In this strange world that these people live in, there is only one person who knows of the beauty of originality and love: The Receiver.  He must bear the weight of all the glorious memories of life and the painful ones of death for the entire community, even if it means that he will be the only one to realize how truly emotionless everything is.  When Jonas is assigned this job, he must learn these memories from the past Receiver, who, since he is no longer receiving, refers to himself as \\"The Giver\\". <br /> <br />This unique and entertaining page-turner is unpredictable, and will keep you wondering.  Just when you are content with all that's happening, a new twist makes you wonder and keeps you reading.  This book was very detailed, though the ending was slightly foggy for me.  And it actually pulls you in, and almost makes you feel what the characters are feeling.  I recommend it to all readers!

0812550706|5.0|The trouble with most science fiction books is that they bore the mainstream reader with numbing scientific facts and speculations, confusing some and crossing the line into unintelligent literature.  Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game takes a calculated leap beyond mere scientific blather, and infuses fantastical science with real emotion and a relevant message. <br /> In Ender's Game, the young Ender Wiggen is enrolled in the orbiting battle school at the age of six, part of a military program that is training military geniuses to fight off an alien threat.  However, Ender is not like the other abnormally intelligent six year olds enrolled in the battle school.  He is a genius among geniuses, and is forced to develop his leadership and tactical skills to their full extent by Lieutenant Graff because of his immense potential.  The book documents Ender's intense journey through school, closely studying his relationship with his planet-side family, his peers, his teachers, and perhaps most importantly, himself. <br /> In reading this book I found myself wondering, what relevance can this boy's incredible sacrifice have in our very different world?  I discovered that his situation is merely a metaphor for the sacrifices we make daily for the rest of humanity.  People we don't even know are affected by how we act everywhere we go, and Ender's stride towards excellence at immense personal cost is an example of how we often strive to act in our lives.  Card's straightforward writing style makes it easy for any reader to see the high moral standard he is constructing through his vibrant fantasy world.  Another important aspect of the book is his use of children as the main characters.  Their constant struggle for recognition in Ender's Game as well as their complex range of emotions sheds light on the station of children in our own world.  Card reaches out to embrace the mind of a child, an underappreciated resource in our society.  Truly Ender's Game is a masterpiece goingbeyond entertaining science fiction, bringing a comprehensive message to our world. <br />

B0007O38F8|3.0|As a Hip Hop head, I really don't favor all of that pop bullsh*t that cats like 50 Cent put out. \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" was horrible. Everything from the production, lyrics, concepts, and guest appearances was just horrible. As an open minded individual, I gave 50 another chance and downloaded \\"The Massacre\\", his sophomore LP, as soon as it was leaked on the net. The first listen was not that good. Then I burned it on CD and played it in my CD player on the way to school, and I started feeling more tracks. \\"Piggy Bank\\" seems to be the CD's strongest cut. Of course Nas, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Shyne, and the rest of the world is going to eat him alive, but he came nice with \\"Piggy Bank\\".  <br /> <br />The Strongest tracks on the albums seem to be: <br />\\"Piggy Bank\\" <br />\\"In My Hood\\" <br />\\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" <br />\\"God Gave Me Style\\" <br />\\"Position Of Power\\" <br />\\"So Amazing\\" <br /> <br />Although it's a nice album, it's not more then average. 50 Cent suprised me with this one. 3.5 stars. <br /> <br />~1~
B0007O38F8|1.0|I am very disappointed with this album. There are a few good songs but they are far and few in between. this album is nowhere as good as the first album. The Game's album is a hell of lot better than 50's effort. 50 step your game back up for the next album or lose more fans!
B0007O38F8|4.0|First of all personally i like get rich or die tryin more. But this is still hott.  O yea for the kidd that said tht hate it or love it remix doesn't count why???? It was 50's song to begin wit. And everybody is like oo the game's album is better but its not. Hate it or love it, how we do, and westside story was 50's joints. Now nowin that name one song that was on game's album that is better than any on 50's album. Add those three songs to 50's album and take out his worst 3 u guys would still be hatin on it. keep doin ur thing 50
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I just picked this up at borders a few hours ago, and I'm loving it! <br />Although I loved Deloused, I think this is better than their debut.

B00007GZQZ|5.0|Overall this picture is a must watch for anybody considering major home renovations, or just needing to laugh out loud. <br /> <br />Working with contractors on a scale such as this movie portrays can be an experience of a lifetime. The accuracy of the characters and the shenanagins that can occur was so real, that this picture could also be considered a doumentary. It had to be based on someone's personal experience.  <br /> <br />A good preview for anyone looking to purhase and rehab a \\"fixer upper\\" aka handyman specials.

0440237688|5.0|This book is sad and somewhat disturbing, but very well conceived and written. It is not light fun reading, but it's worth the effort to get through it. Lois Lowry's words and descriptions made her alternate future world come alive. <br /> A common complaint was that the ending leaves readers hanging. While it's good to make readers think, it's also nice to have a complete story. (The Giver's sequels also have this problem.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this book was excellent for students in 5th grade or higher.
0793518326|5.0|This is a great an accurate book. I had the Beatles \\"1\\" and \\"Guitar Songbook\\" and this book overshadows them both. The only complaint I have is that on a few of the songs (ex. \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" are played using a capo and this book does not show that. If you understand the technique and a little music theory, it's very easy to figure out how to play with a capo. The tab and music is somewhat small, I have good eye sight though. If your eye sight is bad, you may want to try and find someone who has the book so you can thumb through it. Bottom line, though, IT'S ACCURATE and IT HAS ALL THE BEATLES SONGS INCLUDED. Nothings going to perfect and not everyone is going to like it. Just give it a chance, I doubt you'll regret it.
6304806442|5.0|\\"Trainspotting\\", a classic movie that spawned a classic soundtrack, hit the big screen in 1996 and is based on Irvine Welsh's debut novel. Starring, among others, a pre-Jedi Ewan McGregor, Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle, the film is mostly set in Edinburgh and London. The film is narrated by Mark Renton - known to some as Rent Boy and played by McGregor. It tells the story of our 'hero' and his friends : a group of junkies and / or criminals.     As the film opens, Renton is already a heroin addict - though, as it progresses, he tries several times to get off the drug. Most of his friends are also addicts - the most notable exception is Begbie, played by Carlyle. Franco (as he is occasionally known) is an ignorant, obnoxious, violent, hard-drinking bully, who likes nothing better than being at the center of a brawl. Sick Boy - played by Miller - is as much a rival to Renton as a friend. He is also something of an expert on Sean Connery, particularly in his 007 days. (Miller's grandfather, funnily enough, played \\"M\\" in the Bond movies until 1979). For some reason, I found Spud (played by Ewen Bremmer) to be the most likeable character - or, at least, the one I had the most sympathy for...I'm not entirely sure why, when it was Tommy who had the worst luck of all. (Bremmer was also in the running for the part of Renton - he'd played that part on stage in Edinburgh and London). The gang's dealer is known as Mother Superior - it's not that he's particularly religious, it's more to do with the length of his habit.     The soundtrack is superb - New Order feature, while Primal Scream begged to be allowed to write a song after seeing a rough cut of the movie. I now find it hard not to think of the film's opening scene when I hear Iggy Pop's \\"Lust for Life\\", while Lou Reed's \\"Perfect Day\\" inclusion is not entirely unexpected, but thoroughly welcome.     Anyone who tells you that \\"Trainspotting\\" glamorises drug-taking in general, and heroin use in particular, simply can't have watched it. While there is a great deal of humor, many of the scenes and situations do not present addiction as an appealing option. Renton and his friends see a great deal of action : constipation when hooked, impressive bouts of diarrhoea when coming off the drug, the risk of catching HIV / AIDS, the sickness brought on by going cold turkey and the potentially fatal effects of too big a hit. As a result, it's not for the easily offended or the squeamish - while it's one of my favorite movies, I wouldn't recommend watching it with your grandparents !
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This film is great. It has all the elements of what an entertaining film should have: good direction, good acting, great sountrack and no attempt at taking itself too seriously or selling itself short. The backyard scene near the beginning is awesome, and one of the many highlights in the film.     The DVD special features make this even more of a worthwhile purchase. It's all good. Take it all in at once or in little doses. There is enough on the DVD to please.     The film is influenced by the original, 'Dawn Of The Dead'. There are other subtle \\"influences\\" throughout the film; check out the, Zomb-O-Meter (zombie trivia), in the special features!     This film is unique! That's hard to say for so many other films in this genre.
B0007O38F8|2.0|It is too bad 50 had to let the Game go, the Game and him worked so well together and it made for a better album in The Documentary than 50 could do alone with The Massacre.  I knew 50 was in trouble when his first two singles were remakes of Loyd Banks On Fire and Lil Kim's Magic Stick and the rest of the album doesnt even live up to those tracks.  Piggy Bank and Gunz come out are \\"B\\" rated tracks and the rest are all down hill from there.  Some of 50's best tracks on his last album came from the help of Eminem (patiently waiting) and Nate Dog (21 questions).  Add this to the success of How We Do and Hate it or Love it where he was the Games sidekick and it becomes obvious that 50 does his best work along side other talents.  Its too bad only a handful of tracks are set up this way on the Massacure.  Plus... Nas?  I believe someone's boss once rapped \\"It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outkast,Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me\\"....not smart to upset the ones that the boss respects
B0007O38F8|5.0|Just like to say this is very good.  i have no idea why people are saying it is not..... class songs include outta control, candy shop (of course), disco inferno, balltimore love thing (the story of an addict), just a lil bit and my toy solider. however i will agree some of the lyrics are weak and gatman and robin is pretty poor.  I would also like to add, the hooks on this album are simply first class with no doubt! It is unbeleiveable how good some of them are.  The most discussed song piggy bank is just a warning shot \\"this is chess not chequers\\" think about it. Summary you have to be foolish not to buy this album.  DON'T HATE APPRECIATE
B000002MIB|5.0|Live:Right Here,Right Now is Van Halen's only official live album to date. Live:Right Here,Right Now features performances of a lot of Sammy Hagar era Van Halen's best songs. Some fans complain that there are only three songs from David Lee Roth's era, but Sammy Hagar had plenty of popular songs with Van Halen, so who cares? If you want DLR buy one of his CDs or go to one of his shows. As for the sound quality of the album, it is pretty good in my opinion. The only real downsides to the albums are that 10 out of the 11 songs on For Unlawful Carnal KNowledge are on the album, and the over indulgent bass and drum solos.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Long time priest fan here.Have it all ect... <br /> This cd contains elements from all of priests music.At times I feel like I`m listening to sad wings or sin after sin.Other times it has a painkiller vibe to it.It has something for every TRUE priest fan. <br /> Gripes: I wish it had more songs.A couple or really fast heavy ones would have been cool. <br /> The boys dont show out( shred ) on the guitar the way I had hoped for.I also think they quit using the rocktron piranha & went back to marshall amps.Thereby sacrificing the heavy tone they had on painkiller & jugulator.Although the sound is good...just not bone crushing. <br /> Pros:  Since its not as heavy as the afore mentioned cds, I can eat a bowl of soup while listening to it without shoving my face in it.(overcoming the urge to bang thy head ) <br /> Rod Halford still has the best pipes in the buisness!!!Ripper was a clone.Now he is ruining another great band ICED EARTH!!I liked jugulator but demolition really Sucked!!!And ripper needs to find a style (and band)of his own. <br /> All in all I like the Cd quite a bit & hope for more music from the priest in the future.Glad to see bands like Priest,Maiden & Dio sticking to thier guns. <br /> In closing I say...the reason we cant \\"get past\\" master of puppets is because nothing better has ever been made.
B00005K9LM|5.0|This is a great album with alot of great songs, It is a must buy for Priest fans or any metal fan.5 stars all the way!!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Judas Priest are back!!!  And boy are they ever.  For a Judas Priest CD this one kicks you in the teeth and dares you to get up.  It's very reminiscent of Painkiller...full of energy and heavy as HE double.  If you're a Priest fan, trust me, disappointed is a word you won't have to use on this one... <br />However, if you're into Primal Fear, and feel as though Primal Fear are Priest wanna be, or believe as I do, that PF are what Judas Priest wish they could be, well then, as I stated before...awesome as a Priest CD, but if it were a PF CD, it would be a very poor effort indeed. <br />But aren't we all Judas Priest fans as well as Primal Fear fans?  We respect each band as who they are and what they've given us...THE HEAVIEST F'IN METAL in the world!!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|All of the songs on this CD are great. My favorites are \\"Before I Forget\\", \\"Vermillion Pt.2\\", \\"duality\\", and \\"Blister Exists\\". Overall an awesome CD and Slipknot's best.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Yo this cd is ok hes just fallowen in Ems footsteps and its mest up wat happened between him and Game but i thought something would happen like that.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne is a bad influence on her impressionable fans.  <br />All she ever sings about is how much life sucks and how awful it was growing up in the suburbs.  Who wants to listen to that?  And why write a song about it!?  Listening to this whole CD is painful, to say the least.  The song subjects hardly vary from song to song.  Avril Lavigne never has anything positive or optimistic to say about anybody or anything.  All she ever does is whine and complain about how awful life is.  Her voice is cynical, sarcastic, whiney, and annoying, and most of the songs sound the same.  Every song on here is just a miserable display of self pity and negativity.   <br /> <br />And as for all you parents who praise Avril for being a \\"good role model\\" just because she dresses different from Brittany Spears, don't you realize that Avril Lavigne is a bad influence on your young, impressionable daughter?  Don't you think letting her just sit there in her room, hour after hour,  brooding over this teenage angst ridden complaint rock is a mental health hazzard?  Anything this negative causes depression.  I have an 11 year old daughter myself, and she wanted me to buy her this CD.  When we listened to it in the car on the way home, I decided it was not appropriate for such a naive, impressionable mind.  I banned this CD from my home months ago, and we still don't listen to Avril Lavigne in my house.  And neither should any other impressionable kids.
B0007P3582|2.0|This album doesn't have any good beats! There are like a couple of tracks that stand out to me 10.Ski Mask Way 11.A Baltimore Love Song. The rest is like album fillers. It almost seems like 50 didn't even try to make this album lyricly he isn't using the word play and punch lines he used to. I think he needs to take more time consintrating on writing his raps like he used to rather then braging about how much money he's got in interviews and how much other artist sold. Also don't get it twisted I am not a G UNIT Hater at all I own every one of there cd's and mixtapes before there deal plus Get Rich Or Die Tryin ,Beg for Mercy ,Banks ,Buck's and former G Unit Member The Game and they are all better then The Massacare .
B0007TKNL0|5.0|\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is one of the few \\"favorite musicals\\" I haven't seen a production of, despite trying to for a number of years.  I listened to and memorized the music, and bought the original novel and the original cast recordings, and from reading the novel and the libretto, pictured in my mind what it must be like.  Musically, the score is excellent, and one that I love to sing, the plot is compelling, and I do hope to see it in the future. <br /> <br />Having said that, I believe that this was an incredible adaptation.  It made the story line a tad more believeable, while still keeping the mystery of the original libretto.  The first time I saw it, it was a bit strange to hear a baritone singing the part of the Phantom, especially when I remind myself of Michael Crawford's original mastery of the role.  And I missed the testosterone that Steve Barton brought to the role of Raoul.  However, I loved their interpretation.  It added to the movie that the Phantom was rather young and held as much (if not more) sex appeal than Raoul.  It made his plight all the more terrible in the end.   <br /> <br />But the best part of the movie was the role of Christine, which Emmy Rossum sang with such innocence and grace, taking the role and reinterpreting it from Sarah Brightman's original creation into something new and fresh, yet keeping all the original emotion that made Christine's character work in the original.  As a vocalist, I loved listening to her sing the part. Her voice was clear without being technically strident, and held a pure innocence that truly embodies Christine in a way that Sarah Brightman's technical singing could never convey.  It made the music much more accessible.  I have sung Christine's lines over and over for years, and I still could not match the technical brilliance that Sarah Brightman shows in the original cast recording, but Emmy's performance, though less technical, was just as beautiful, giving the music a warm emotion and accessibility that the original did not have. <br /> <br />And a quick word here about Carlotta, Minnie Driver totally captured this conceited diva! She did it with such flare, I found myself almost wishing I could hate Carlotta more than I did to begin with.  Some of the best laughs in the movie are Carlotta's. <br /> <br />The scenery is very good, if at times a little hammy.  Still, it was thrilling to watch the stage and house change from black and white into color, as the chandelier rose.  I leaned over to my friend and said, \\"This is definitely a buyer.\\"  The rest of the movie did not disappoint.
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|Many of the best parts and the depth of the original story are edited out, somewhat understandable in translating a 1000+ pages of drawing into a 2 hour movie. On the plus side, the color added to some of the images. 3 and 1/2 star movie at best, maybe 4 for those who haven't read the astounding graphic novel. I give it three here to bring down average from five, no way is it a five. The story is just as complex as Lord of the Rings and would need three movies to be treated fully. This version, while not without it's charms, smacks of Hollywood.  <br />I was a fan of Miyazaki since seeing \\"Spirited Away,\\" his true cinematic masterpiece. I have watched most of his other animation and am only slightly moved by these lesser works.  <br />You would do better with the graphic novels on every level.
0743544676|5.0|I was recently given a copy of the book \\"He's Just Not That into You\\" by my twin sister. Having just ended a 6 year relationship my-self I though what could it hurt?  <br />Oh was I wrong, it did hurt. ALOT. \\"He's Just Not That into You\\" opened my eyes enabling me to see the bad in my previous relationship. <br />  Greg Behrendt is brutally honest with his readers. But it is just that...honest. He doesn't sugar the coat the fact that your mans not calling you because he doesn't want to or that if he really wanted to see you he'd make time. His advice is both constructive and eye opening. Behrendt takes real life situations and explains to the reader what's going on in their guys head. He gives them advice on how to deal with certain subjects and warning signs to look out for in your relationships. Behrendt reassures women about them-selves and justifies that yes, most men really are as terrible as we perceive them to be.  <br /> I recommend this book to any woman who is confused with her relationship and is asking her-self where to go from here. \\"He's Just Not That into you\\" is an easy ready for women of all backgrounds, from best friends and colleagues to sisters and roommates.  <br />
B0007O38F8|3.0|HE definately don't come with the Energy of his first album, which was a masterpiece. It seems like on the first album he was raw and had nothing to prove, like he was hard and told true hood stories, but on this album it's like he's comming off harder than he needs to be, like he's overdoing it. All the Rhymes on this album are all about makin money or bustin a cap in somebody, but at least his skills aren't rusty and he can still convey the message, and the beats are definately tight for the most part. 50 needs to work on some more messages in his songs and he just might be able to captivate the audience he once did, but this album is still worth checkin out with a couple of club bangers on it <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I am NOT a fan of At The Drive In's style of music.  When I first heard about The Mars Volta I was interested until I found out 2 of the band members used to be in ATDI. So I just forgot about the band figuring it would be more pop-punk crap.  However, with this album my curiousity overcame my reservations and I checked it out (its $6.99 pricetag at Best Buy didn't hurt either) and I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  This album is the best of 2005 so far, and I think it will be hard to beat.  Of course, this style of music is not for everyone and many people will hate this, but I think its fantastic.  I can't wait for their CD single thats going to come out (entitled Frances The Mute, it is a 3 part song).  They are calling it the \\"decoder\\" for this album. <br /> <br />For anyone who has the CD, inside the case, where the CD is held, you see a list of 3 tracks and some lyrics?  Those are the lyrics and stuff for the single. <br /> <br />I will definitely be checking out De-Loussed now that I've heard this.
B000002MJC|5.0|Ever heard music so beautiful, so three dimensional, so layered with emotion, that you could cry?  SOFAD will do it for you.    This is not the sequel to Violator, if that's what you were expecting. This is a unique stand alone DM album with a mind of its own. (But so worthy and in need of recognition.) It will take a good getting used to before you fall in love with this album. It took me a good month, and a good understanding of the lyrics before I was truly enlightened. Once you've understood though, you will find yourself completely sucked into this emotional realm of darkness, love, and faith.     With the exception of Condemnation, I love all the songs on this album. Each one takes on its own personality. Dave Gahan's voice is in the expected loud and luscious, but is absolutely the most intriguing, phenominal, and gorgeous that we've ever heard. He becomes a Michael Hutchence (INXS) on I Feel You. Mercy In You, one of my most favourite DM songs, just totally rocks. Higher Love takes me into another dimension. Martin Gore also has a couple of his own numbers. Now is it just me, or does One Caress have that Erasure 2 Ring Circus sound to it? You gotta love it though.     An experimental album for DM, but this is their absolute ultimate best. My most favourite indeed. Why this did not take off? I still have no idea?     People just don't get it...
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Great lyrics, awesome riffs as it should be PRIEST ARE BACK!
B000009EAD|5.0|True Iced Earth with none other than Matt Barlow on vox!!! If you are new to Iced Earth, this is the album to start with. I must caution, however, that the entire album is rich with religion overtones, particularly Catholic ones. I am wondering if Schaffer is a closet Catholic, or if he's just pissed off at them.  <br />Inhibitions aside, IE mix highly energetic and powerful heavy metal (sometimes reminiscent of Iron Maiden) with beautiful harmony and some quite haunting, melodic guitar work, making it a style of music that is truly their own.  <br />The songs are arranged and composed quite nicely--- the something wicked trilogy almost reminds me of some of the music from the movie, the Omen. A true future classic!!! <br /> <br /> <br />Song # <br />1. Burning Times- High energy tune reminscing the several times throughout history when the church condemmed anyone of Witchcraft who did not proclaim Christ as their savior.  <br /> <br />2. Melancholy (Holy Martyr)- When I went to see IE perform live a few years ago, Barlow opened the piece by saying that \\"this is a song about a man who walked the earth 2,000 years ago- a man that has been misunderstood ever since.\\" <br /> <br />3. Disciples of The Lie- Schaffer clearly didn't have a good relationship with the papacy at the church he grew up in. here, he accuses them of hypocrisy (\\"I gotta do as you say, not as you do\\") <br /> <br />4. Watching Over Me- Written by Schaffer for a friend of his who lost his life in a motorcylce accident <br /> <br />5. Stand Alone- Follow your heart, not the church.  <br /> <br />6. Consequences- A very melancholical, power metally piece that, while written in the late 90's illustrates the situation our country is in, in terms of the war we're in and the killing we do in the name of our gods.  <br /> <br />7. My Own Savior- Escaping it all by way of suicide and starting all over again in the next life.  <br /> <br />8. 1776- This is an instrumental, so there's not much to say, here....I can't help though, but picture Achilles marching out to battle the Titans when I listen to this song.  <br /> <br />9. Blessed Are You (Children of The Night)- The title speaks for itself.  <br /> <br />10-12: Something Wicked Trilogy: a three part story illustrating the Biblical prophecy of the end times, the birth of the anti-Christ and what is to come when he comes to power over the world.
0345363132|5.0|Most of us have a preconceived opinion of Richard III.  Be it of a good man, victim of the circumstances, or of an evil being who wouldn't hesitate to murder his own flesh and blood to usurp a throne that didn't belong to him. But the truth is that Richard was a man of his time, one who, to his misfortune, lacked the \\"sun\\" personality, character and appearance of his brother Edward.  Is this a crime?  To Richard it was. <br />But this book is not only about Richard, the last of the Plantagenet kings.  It is also about Edward IV, George of Clarence, the Earl of Warwick, Anne Neville . . . It is about a fascinating time in history. <br />I read this book a long time ago (I have read everything Ms. Penman has written) and enjoyed it so much that I would like every reader out there to share in my experience.  Don't miss this book, it is the best of the historic fiction genre. <br />
B0007NFL18|4.0|I'm not a big 50 fan and he's from my hood, but this album is hot. Not as good as \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" but that cd was hard to follow. I can't listen to every song on the album but \\"Piggy Bank\\", \\"Get in My Car\\" and \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" just to name a few make it worth the purchase.
0671027344|5.0|Last year when I was in AP English 11, my teacher recommended this book to one of my best friends.  After she finished reading it, she could not stop raving about how awesome it was (and this is coming from a girl that apsolutly HATES books).  For almost a year she kept bugging me to read it, but I could not get past the $13.00 price tag.  One day I found the novel used at my library, and I picked it up.  I started reading the book durring my first period Anatomy class, and I didn't stop until 1 o'clock in the morning when I finished the book (I got into a lot of trouble showing up the next day with none of my homework done), but it was that great of a book. <br /> <br />The story follows a very naive boy named Charlie, and how he survive's his freshman year of high school be befriending a couple of outcast senior, that bring him into the world.  On top of that though he has to deal with all the problems that plague him at home as well. <br /> <br />This book is very layered a rich, and takes a few reads to be fully comprehended on the outside what seems like a charming novel about a boy growing up turns into a bittersweat cautionary tale, finally becoming a devestating psychological breakdown of the character.  And It is the small detail that really make this book what it is.  I made the mistake of skimming a few of the \\"slow pages\\" which later made it impossible to comprehend the future plot. <br /> <br />This is a definate must read for anyone who has gone through the peril of their freshman year of high school, and eventhough it may be over alot of people's heads, it will still make an impact none the less... <br /> <br />And don't forget to read the hidden ending on the last page!
B000002ADT|5.0|Bottom line: <br />If you love this album, and you love someone, play this for them. This album has so much appeal. It's like the comsumate album for lovers. Enuf said. 10 stars!
0553573403|5.0|This book came to me recommended by a friend.  Not being a fantasy fanatic, I hesitated when I read the first 20 or so pages and wasn't sure I was ready to plunge into an 800+ page book of magical characters.<br /><br />Thanks to Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, I now count myself among millions of fantasy fiction fans.  A Game of Thrones weaves a subtle plot with characters that the reader gets to know intimately (and are worth knowing).  The characters live and breathe -- are real people.  This book was good enough to entice me to read his whole series.  And that says a lot considering that I had never read a book over 500 pages before this series.<br /><br />Martin's books are lengthy, but not moreso than needed.  Even if you're not a fantasy fan, even if a 1,000 page book scared you off in the past, you might want to give this one a try.  Quite worth the investment.  The pages pass quickly as you sit back and take in Martin's carefully crafted world.<br /><br />Martin broadened my horizon's to include fantasy fiction thanks to his terrific writing!
B0000AGWJ7|2.0|Listen, this album is marginal at best, but its a step in the right direction. These guys are young and they have potential, but they have to get their act together. I'm always cautious when bands claim to be influenced by Pantera and want to jam like Iron Maiden.  <br />But seriously, I haven't heard this much whining since the last Staind album came out. You just want to grab the mic from the guy and hand him a pacifier. The rhythm guitar work is okay, but it sounds just like every other band in the genre. After awhile, they all just become carbon copies of each other and I can't tell them apart and these guys don't stand out at all. The soloing just plain stinks, but at least he's trying. That whole bit at about the 4:30 mark of \\"Chapter Four\\" reminds me alot of my old school Nintendo. (I had a sudden urge to go save a princess.) Don't get me wrong, these guys have some potential (like I said they're young), there were some okay spots on the album. \\"I won't see you tonight Part 1\\" isn't all together bad, but I swear it's Axl Rose playing keyboards for them. They need to find more edge though.  <br />If you want to get serious, check out Unearth's last one \\"The oncoming storm\\" (the song \\"Endless\\" is incredible) or Poison the Well's \\"You come before you\\". If you want more whiny junk check out Finch's \\"What it is to burn\\", at least they do it right. If you want some good metal and guys who know how to solo Pro-Pain's \\"Fistfull of hae\\" is where its at.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Anyone fool who didn't learn from Gay-Z about tryin' to diss KING NASIR should automatically get 0 stars from attempting that garbage \\"swinebank\\".

B0002X314C|5.0|This product is just the most perfect blend of vocal talent, production and lyrical content that anyone could ask for.  Upbeat tracks, meaningful messages, and the only bad thing about this CD is that the artist's live performance puts the recorded version to shame.  But I think I can live with that.  All the tracks are 5/5 for me.  It is your year Kanye West and it seems that you know how to surround yourself with individuals who compliment and promote your gifts.  Jesus Walks........
0792843584|1.0|One of the most expensive art-house movies I've ever seen. (Meaningful glance.  Look out window wistfully - Seven minutes later.)<br /><br />  May have deserved another star for photography, but by the end of the film pouring blinding light in through slightly open doors and windows and underlighting the foreground, and then drenching it in a sepia-bath, got old. (Go to roller rink.  Have derby hatted rollerskating boy with violin play a symphony or two while rabble pound and cheer.  Have him go into bandbox.  Cut to shot of Jeff Bridges vomiting.  Exchange meaningful glances for five minutes.  Have band play long dance tune so rabble can roller-dance.  More meaningful glances.  Finally have Isabelle and Kris dance in now empty building.)<br /><br />  HEAVEN'S GATE moves about as quickly as a gila monster with a gullet full of Seconal.  Brutally bad, with too much dross and too little dramatic pacing.  (Exchange one last long lingering glance and, unless you like train wrecks masquarading as movies, move on, pilgrim.)
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|Let me begin that the only remote thing about this movie is the acting. The characters, the story, the way that violence and justice are holding hands is gut-wrenching. I might go into SPOILERS so those who haven't seen this movie yet only know this: Don't watch this unless you advocate taking justice into your own hands and getting away with murder. I don't know where to begin! The acting is good. NOT great, CERTAINLY not OSCAR quality, but good. The cinematography of the movie is nothing special, much less the directing. This IS NO MASTERPIECE. It's something that I would have gone off watching on TV. The problem of this movie is how it suddenly veers off into questionable territory and off subject. For example, throughout the movie, Kevin Bacon's character Sean, is constantly called by his ex-wife who never really talks. In the end, when Sean finds out that Jimmy killed Dave (Tim Robbins' character), his wife suddenly appears. All of a sudden, he suddenly seems to forget that Jimmy killed Dave and everything is happy dandy. I agree with the previous reviewer in that Dave's wife sold him out. The scene where Sean finds out that Jimmy killed Dave plays out HORRIBLY. Sean doesn't arrest him, doesn't threaten him or anything. He just stays there as Jimmy walks off drunk down the street. And the rest of the film is just trite and boring. No interesting characters. Please don't waste your time with this film OR the book.
B00003CXE7|5.0|First off, I just have to say that this is a fabulous movie in every possible way: the screenplay, the acting, the action, and even the soundtrack are all top notch. It really doesn't get much better than this! I also want to respond to the review titled \\"pure hollywood\\" by king wolf, where the reviewer criticizes the scene where Maximus and Commodus battle in the Colosseum. This scene actually has historical significance! Commodus, whose character is fairly strictly based on the Roman emperor of the same name, did battle gladiators in the Colosseum as a way of showing off for the people of Rome. Although he wasn't killed this way, he was assassinated by an athlete! So, king wolf, if you were slack-jawed during that scene, it was for the wrong reason.
0440237688|5.0|Throughout the centuries, Christians have been buoyed up by a utopian vision of the afterlife given in Revelation 21:4, \\"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\\"  However, what about creating heaven on earth?  What price would people be willing to pay for a world in which there is no more war, hunger, or social strife?  Lois Lowry gives a frightening look at one such answer in her book The Giver.   <br />     Through a young boy named Jonas, we are introduced to a community whose citizens live in nearly total conformity to society's rules.  At first glance, the order and homogeneity of the community appears to have created a nearly perfect society.  However, as we look more carefully at the eerie extrapolation of the trend to sacrifice liberties for law and order at any cost, we see that Jonas' community has lost many of the basic freedoms we take for granted: privacy, choice of occupation, the ability to express disagreement with society's norms, the ability to learn from the past, the choice of whom to marry and where to live, the ability to reproduce and experience sexual pleasure, even the ability to continue to live when not a productive member of society.  This future society has even gone so far as to rob people of the memories normally passed down as stories from generation to generation.  Incorporated into the storyline of the book is the ultimate symbol of the blandness of their regulated lives, the inability of the people to perceive color: they see the world only in terms of black and white.   <br />     Interwoven with flashbacks to illustrate, Lowry skillfully introduces concepts in a terminology that is easily understood, yet different from the way we normally speak: newchildren, birthmothers, nurturers, the Receiver, the Committee of Elders, the House of the Old, release, seeing beyond, and elsewhere.  There are also various ceremonies: The Naming, The Ceremony of Twelve, Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony, Ceremony of Loss, etc.  This layered description produces a sense of \\"otherness,\\" while the detail which it affords lends an air of reality to the story.  Each of these words has a connotation special to the environment of the community.  In fact, one realizes that the citizens have been trained to think that apart from the rigid structure of the community, there is no real meaning to life.  To fulfill one's given purpose in service to the community has become the all in all.  We learn later in the book that although any citizen is given the ability to ask for release from the community, to reject service to the community is in reality to ask for a summary execution. <br />     When Jonas, a dutiful child, is chosen to be the next \\"receiver,\\" the faade of perfection is ripped apart.  He is stunned with the realization that release means execution, something foreshadowed as early as the second page of the book when a beginning pilot veers off course and a voice announces in an ironic tone, \\"Needless to say, he will be released.\\"  Jonas experiences true feelings and a depth of emotion which the average citizen is not allowed.  With his new found emotions he is overwhelmed and abhorred by the thought of his father casually murdering babies who do not measure up to society's standards.  And together, the old receiver and the new receiver determine to give something to their community which has been lacking for countless generations.   <br />     The conflict with society which Jonas experiences as the seed of individuality germinates within him is what makes his character development such an integral part of the story.  Fascination with his increasing realization of reality and the struggle to fight against the wrong he perceives rivets the attention of the reader.  In the beginning, there was no question as to what he would do when the ubiquitous Big Brother-like speakers announced that an unauthorized snack must be returned.  But his exchange with the Receiver about color shows that his eyes have been opened in more than one way: \\"It isn't fair that nothing has color!... If everything's the same, then there aren't any choices!  I want to wake up in the morning and decide things!\\"   The continued conversation reveals the reason why the community's founders took away choices from people.  Jonas muses, \\"We don't dare to let people make choices of their own.\\"  And with uncertainty adds, \\"Definitely not safe.\\"  This juxtaposition of words \\"uncertainty\\" and definitely\\" is merely one example of how beautifully Lowry uses language to dynamically portray the conflicting emotions roiling within Jonas. <br />     The growing conflict as Jonas' character develops is not the only thing that attracts and holds the reader's attention.  It is his interaction with those in his life as his feelings develop that we can identify with.  Along with the black and white view of the world, the people in the community have no ability to distinguish beyond the superficial.  They may know likes and dislikes, but they don't know what it is to abhor or love with depth of meaning.  When Jonas asks whether his parents love him, we realize just how meaningless the word is to them as they fail to relate to the question.  The reader begins to realize the tremendous price that Jonas' society has paid for a lack of conflict.  Their eyes cannot see color because their souls are vapid.  On the other hand, as Jonas interacts with the Giver we are fascinated by the deepening understanding in the Giver's heart of what must be done for the good of the society.  As the Receiver remembers his daughter's death and discusses his grief with Jonas, it is the stimulus for a new way of thinking.  Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, we see the Giver's spirit renewed at the thought of giving a new way of life to his community.   <br />    Truly this book succeeds in bringing to the fore many social questions.  However, it succeeds on a deeper level by challenging our emotional IQ.  The courage and strength which Jonas shows as he shoulders a burden for the ultimate benefit of his society is heartwarming and inspiring.  The ending is left ambiguous on purpose, but it matters not.  Lowry's purpose was not to provide a resolution, but rather to inspire further thought. <br />

B0007NFL18|5.0|From track 1 to 22 this cd goes hard we know about candyshop and disco inferno. But other tracks like hate or love it remix, piggy bank, gatman and robin stand out as well. Don't sleep on 50 the G-unit family are gonna be around for a long time. 50 has a variety of producers on this album and it really gives him a different sound, although he keeps his thug image this album is sure to be a classic.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Despite what people are saying i listen to all of 50's stuff.This album is crazy but is not as good as get rich or die tryin'. All the songs are catchy and grow on to you very quickly  theres 22 songs and if u listen to um all the hooks stick in ya head honestly 50 could've done better but the album was still off the chain.Haters gone say diffrent but buy it its worth it  for real 50 fans he just aint as much hungry but the music is still crackin.

B0007O38F8|1.0|50 cents new album is so bad, i could not believe it to be true. the productions are so bad on this album, he should have just stuck to dre beats. this guy sings more on the album then he raps. that is a big hands down! in regards to the track \\"gatman and robin\\".... is it me or does eminems verse on that track OUTSHINES 50's whole album? 50 used alot of old weak material from his last album.... \\"baltimore love\\" ... \\"im not a genie in a bottle, im in a bag\\" lololol what was that about? this guy is real garbage <br /> <br />he used hot like tea kettle (couldnt u come up with another comparison to hot?) <br />he used \\"put a whole in your back\\" again! (thats getting old now) <br /> piggy bank is garbage... i dont see how he says he would have rappers running for their lives, how he would shoot them, cut skin with knife.... the dude has been beefing with ja rule for 4 years and still havnt slaped boxed him. And if you go to riaa.com and check out the platnium status, it shows that 50 cent only went 6 times platnium.. not the 11 that he claims.  <br />he says he would have shyne shanked for a few pennies out his piggy bank.... now why is he talking about it? and havnt done it yet? this guy is a phoney. the production is horrible on the album, gatman and robin sounds like patiently waiting beat recycled. overall this album was a dissapointment. i didnt expect much but at the same time i didnt expect it to be this trash.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I left this DVD on top of the TV for about 2 weeks before I got the guts to watch it. I noticed the rating was for GRISLY VIOLENCE and, as I get older, I find I don't have the same stomach that I had as a youth. <br /> <br />Finally, I sat down and watch this film, and it was AWESOME. <br /> <br />I was very impressed by how tight this film was and how the story unfolded, and the twists and turns. I knew a bit about what the movie was about and found it to be very tense the entire flick. But the story flowed smoothly, the editing was really well done. I was a little depressed at how fast everything wrapped up at the end, because it could have lasted a bit longer, but the last minute twists were great. <br /> <br />I would like to see the NC-17 version or director's cut next. <br /> <br />FANTASTIC movie, but not for kids.
630018403X|5.0|John Hughes, the director of the highly successful \\"Sixteen Candles\\" has created a masterpiece of a movie that had remained popular for twenty years.  This movie focuses on five high school students who are to spend a Saturday in detention for whatever it was that they did wrong.  At the beginning of the day, they didn't even know each other's names, but by the end, they had bared their souls, explained their dreams, and became friends. <br /> <br />Judd Nelson (Bender), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Molly Ringwald (Claire) and Ally Sheedy (Allison) star as the students, while Paul Gleason stars as principal Richard Vernon.  At 7 am, the students enter the library, not knowing each other, but as the movie progresses, they learn more and more about each other so that by the end of the day, they all realize that there is a little bit of everyone in each of them.  Bender is the \\"criminal\\", suffering from a bad homelife, abusive parents, and a lack of self-esteem.  Brian is the \\"brain\\", who believes in studying hard and getting good grades, but he's also a geek.  Andrew is the \\"jock\\".  He is frustrated because he feels that he must live up to his father's high expectations for him.  He snaps under the pressure that his father placed on him.  Claire is the \\"princess\\".  She feels that she's better than everyone, and has the best of everything.  Allison is the \\"basket case\\".  Like Bender, she is suffering from low self-esteem, so she lies to cover up her insecurities. <br /> <br />It is amazing to watch the transformation of these characters, especially the relationship between Claire and Bender.  Although he constantly harasses her throughout the movie, deep down Bender really likes and cares for Claire.  As the movie progresses, the characters soon realize that they all have a little of the same characteristics of each other, such as the scene where they are running from Vernon in the halls and Bender asks Claire how it feels to be bad.  Then they display some of Bender's characteristics by sitting and smoking marajuana.   <br /> <br />There are several funny points in the film as well, such as Bender crashing through the ceiling while telling a joke, and the constant harassment that Vernon faced.  Also, who can forget the great song by Simple Minds? <br /> <br />This is a great movie.  The story is excellent and well-developed.  The acting is first-rate, but I thought that Judd Nelson did an especially good job as Bender.  I give this movie a very high recommendation.  To the outside world they were simply the jock, the criminal, the princess, the brain, and the basket case, but to each other, they would always be the breakfast club.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Good performances by Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast.  Many times when working with child actors it can make or break a film.  I am happy to say it was an asset to this movie.  Solid directon and writing should also be noted here.  The movie had nice pacing and didn't drag much at all.  A great movie suspends the disbelief of the audience. This movie made you feel like you were part of the magic of the making of Peter Pan.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater with my wife on Valentine's Day back in 2004 and bought it on DVD for her (and me) on Valentine's Day 2005. Like most heterosexual men I am NOT a huge fan of romantic comedies. I think most of these films are \\"chick flicks\\" that aren't worth the waste of time to see. Love Actually is so funny and heartfelt with great characters that I actually WANT to see it again and again. Too bad all \\"chick flicks\\" can't be like this.<br /><br />As for the several people who wrote negative reviews about the brief moments of nudity in this film ... this film is CLEARLY meant for an adult audience and is rated R. What kind of R-rated adult romantic comedy doesn't have a few curse words and quick flashes of breasts? The only romantic comedies I've seen that didn't were rated PG or PG-13 ... and those are exactly the kind of \\"chick flicks\\" I hate. I'm not saying this movie needed the boobshots or the harsh language ... the film probably would have worked just as well without it. I will say that the language and the moments of nudity help make this film a bit more \\"honest\\" in terms of its view of adult relationships.
6300274195|5.0|This movie is heart wrenching, funny, and a real tear jerker all at once. The characters in it are outrageous and they keep your attention throughout the storyline. A definate for any Disney home library.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I love this album.  It sounds like it picks up just after Fear of the Dark, a decade later.  The artwork is a nightmare, but such is the fate of all new metal albums.  I can only hope that Overkill will make as good a record.  I gave up on them too.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|My kids watched this movie so many times over and over that I'll bet we are burning out the DVD player and the disk. The digitally remastered version is much nicer to watch than the old version-it is much more crisp and sharp. I would recommend this movie to kids who are 3 or older-the story would be a bit too confusing to kids younger than that. It is a no brainer on this one-get it for your kids!!!
0440237688|4.0|Have you ever wondered what the word \\"utopia\\" means?  This book's about a utopia gone wrong.  If you like those kinds of books, you will love this book because this is the kind of book that's for you.  In this story you will find Jonas, a boy who lives in a place where everything seems right when it's really wrong.  He discovers this after receiving a gift of memory of the past and present.  Jonas fights to make his world right.  We recommend this book to all.  --Sterling Bradbury, Jesse Pho, Kelsey Jarrett and Heather Murrah in Ms. Marik's 6th grade class
B00005RDSM|5.0|I am so in love with this movie, as are my kids-I watched Pan as a kid myself and to this day never got bored watching it again and again. Along with the classic Disney Princess movies-Pan is one of Disney's greatest. Even the sequel \\"Return to Neverland\\" is close in comparison. It makes every boy want to be Pan and every little girl want to be Tink!!!
B00005JNNL|5.0|I am surely not going to bore you with a long explanation (you have enough of those already;-) ). Suffice it to say,  I saw this movie before it came out in the USA while traveling in Barcelona, and recognized the quality of the story-line and the actors who so well depict an issue as current to society as it is polemic. See it.  These are the types of movies we all crave yet get so seldom.
6302158095|5.0|The Fantasia dvd is a beautiful collection of music and of some of Disney's cartoons spliced together. I have to say that although it is a Disney Collection-my kids really did not pay attention to it too much when I bought it last year, along with the Fantasia 2000 DVD -they are just starting to watch it now-they are 3 3/4 and 5 1/4 years old.   It is a beautiful collection, but may not be for younger viewers to watch-they dont understand the concept of it all and may not keep their attention for very long.
B00030590I|2.0|Ok let me just say that the special effects for this thing they call movie is great, probably one of the best ive ever seen, but the story is just not interesting enough and the fight scenes arent even that interesting, I think it tried to hard to be like crouching tiger,hidden dragon and it failed miserably. Chinese martial arts films are not supposed to be like this, and thats that.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Such a captivating movie-the music, characters, scenes, situations and troubles they all get into, keep you glued to the tube. The music is so beautiful. I've heard that some people say Mulan is not a \\"Princess\\" like all the other \\"Disney Princesses\\" but you don't have to have royal blood running through your veins or to marry a prince to be a princess, Mulan is a princess in every way, shape and form.
B000669GAI|5.0|WHERE IS SMILE? GREAT SONG LEFT OFF. OTHERWISE AWESOME COMPILATION. I WAS IMPRESSED WITH I GOT ID BEING PUT ON THERE ALONG WITH BREATHE AND STATE OF LOVE AND TRUST. SOLID ALBUM FOR ANYBODY AND ESSENTIAL. HAS NEW MIXS OF BLACK, ONCE, AND ALIVE WHICH ARE BETTER THEN THE ORIGINALS. NIRVANA IS BETTER, BUT I STILL LOVE PEARL JAM. THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME
B0007O38F8|5.0|Honestly half the review here make no case for how this album  is terrible because in actuality its as good as his first one. When i first heard the album, honestly i thought it was terrible. Get rich had a flow to it while Massacre has a different feel. So initially i thought it was terrible except for the main stream songs such as candy shop and disco inferno.  <br /> <br />However after listening to it for the 6th time top to bottom this is a great album. Best songs are: Outta Control, Ski Mask Way, Ryder Music, Just a lil bit, piggy bank, my toy soldier, and this is 50. If you don't like it at first, don't trash it. You'll be jumpin to it soon enough. The rhymes may not be as smooth as his first album but somehow it works. Long live 50 CENT!
B0007GADZO|5.0|After witnessing Steve's performance last night, easily the most incredible experience of my life, he solidified the fact that he is one of the greatest musicians to ever grace this planet.  Steve continues to make gorgeous, complex compositions on his new concept album, Real Illusions: Reflections.  If you are already a fan of Vai, you shouldn't have to read this: go pick up the album already!  If you're new to Steve, this album may seem a little \\"out there\\" at first, but as with any good music, it may require a few listenings.  I promise it will not disappoint.  \\"Freak Show Excess\\" displays Steve's Zappa influenced jazzy parade of musical wizardry, while the acoustic \\"I'm Your Secrets\\" is perhaps one of this finest ballads Steve has ever written.  The last song, \\"Under it All\\" features some of the most ferocious guitar playing I've ever heard.  Anyway, just get this album, now, and along with it, Mystery Tracks Archives 3.  And if possible, see him perform live; there is nothing quite like it!
B0007O38F8|3.0|as i hope most people will realize, this is the super-commercialized MADE FOR RADIO CD. Get rich was more of a personal journey with some serious emotion and heat behind it, thats what made it such a strong cd in a time mainstream rap is a disgrace to hip hop and black culture in general. This cd is nothin but another yo i got ho's, blunts, money, and im a gangsta cd. this brings absolutly nothing to rap. the rhymes themeselves arent even that good, the songs are almost completely fueled by the beats, which are not as good as on get rich either. in short, this cd is a joke, dont waste your money. its lucky i was generous enough to give it three stars (for like 2 and 1/2).  <br /> <br />FOR THE BEST HIP HOP AND RAP AROUND CHECK OUT: Immortal Technique, Atmosphere, Brother Ali, and Sage Francis...o ya and Royce Da 5'9
0316168815|5.0|We all know the general story by now, so rehashing it won't help much. I simply want to comment on the content and the concept. <br /> <br />I found Sebold's narrative clean and refreshing. There were very, very few attempts at flowery language, and she told her story straightforward with bare hints at metaphor. We weren't assaulted with a bevy of \\"big\\" words used merely to impress the reader; rather, she spoke to us clearly, much as a fourteen-year-old girl would. How invigorating to see an author - especially a first time author - not try to impress us with their remarkable and extensive vocabulary (or at least their sensational ability at thumbing through a thesaurus). <br /> <br />Regarding the concept: I don't know why in the world it took me so long to read this book. When I saw it in hardcover, and read the very first paragraph, I was inexorably and inexplicably linked to the book. I knew that I had to read it, but chose not to until just now. Who knows why? I've been researching Teen and Young Adult literature for the past year and a half, so perhaps I was afraid to break the rhythm. Whatever it was, I'm glad that I finally picked this up. <br /> <br />I'm unaware of any other book to tell a story from this unique point of view. First time writers are told not to end a first person book or story where the main character dies at the end, so instead Sebold started with her character already dead. That's absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br />I was on a plane while reading the majority of this book, and there were times that I really had to fight to hold back from crying. Sebold's management of the family's immediate reactions, and the reactions as the family managed to struggle through their various degrees of acceptance was beautifully told, especially the plight of the father. He was a tortured, misunderstood (perhaps even by himself) character who brought so much life onto every page he appeared, even though he was in a downward spiral that was part of the reason his wife finally left him and found her way working in a winery. <br /> <br />The idea of a person having their own special heaven was just wonderful. Sebold could easily have written about heaven as most people envision it, but she created something slightly different, believable, and refreshing. <br /> <br />There were a few scenes that I questioned, and had problems with, but they were minor, and to divulge them would be giving away some crucial plot points. Even though there are over two thousand reviews of this marvelous book, I'm sure there are many people that haven't read it yet, so I don't want to ruin anything for them. <br /> <br />Enjoy this rare treat. It's equal is not likely to come around any time soon. <br />
B0006SNL2K|5.0|I'm a Slipknot true fan, I got all CD's, Singles, and DVD's <br />I bought the first version of this CD and I was one of the first buying Vol.3 (The Subliminal Verses), but after that I have the surprise that they put a f**king new disc with bonus tracks, that I already has in singles, but with a new cd cover. <br />I'm a Maggot and is part of it to have this new s**t, but i'm sick of this, better to make other Slipknot album than making the true maggots spend so much cash in the same songs in diferent CD's <br /> <br />In general this album is really, really good and better if you don't buy the first version, so you don't make of this an angry situation. BUY IT, Im going to buy the songs I already have again, until I got all the things of Slipknot!! Stay (SIC)!!! <br />MAGGOTS
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I watched this movie on cable, and when I went to pro.imdb.com to see if it had been released to theaters or was a direct to DVD release, I was surprised to see that it had opened in the theaters with twenty million, made fifty million total in the U.S., and added another forty-five million in DVD/Video rentals! I honestly thought, given what I perceived to be some imperfections, that it may have been a direct to DVD release. <br /> <br />While watching the film I was impressed by the lighting, the cinematography, costumes (although why Selene was often dressed like Catwoman didn't make much sense), artwork - in other words, the things that make a film look good. I was also intrigued by the concept of a vampire/werewolf hybrid. <br /> <br />However, if I hadn't read in the movie guide that this was a film about hybrids, I would have been lost. Vampires and werewolves looked the same to me. Perhaps there was a bulging of teeth that the vampires had that the werewolves didn't - truthfully, I don't remember. What I do remember was Lucian - as a human - biting another human and turning him. <br /> <br />There is an interesting twist in the storyline that I didn't see coming, and so I give praise to the writer(s) for that. However, the story sagged in many places. <br /> <br />This is a story about werewolves and vampires. Why did it look like they were cowboys and Indians, having long drawn out shoot-outs? Vampires and werewolves have extraordinary powers: *use them*! I understand that the vampires were shooting with silver bullets, which are anathema to werewolves and perhaps their best weapon (in that movie) against them, and that the werewolves MAY have been shooting the bullets made of concentrated daylight (neat idea - but it wasn't developed at all), but still: battles between vampires and werewolves would have made for more exciting action. When a werewolf attacked Viktor, and he caught it by its throat, there was real tension. The first real tension I experienced, in fact, regarding the feud between werewolves and vampires. That tension came far too late in the film. During the gunfights, there was no tension. For me, gunfights lost their appeal somewhere after The Lone Ranger. <br /> <br />Also, Selene goes to great risk to save Michael, whom she apparently loves, but aside from the fact that she's hot, and he's hot, I have no idea why they liked each other. Sure, this is a \\"monster movie\\", but if there's going to be a love interest that is *really* the center of the story (think about it - if Selene didn't have feelings for Michael, there wouldn't have been a story to tell), then we need to know more about it. <br /> <br />All of my complaining aside, I did enjoy the film; especially the intriguing plot twist and the climax. Interestingly, there wasn't much of a dnouement - just a climax. I guess the dnouement was Selene's voice-over telling us that there would be a sequel although, of course, she didn't use those words. And there will be a sequel. <br /> <br />The hybrid concept was terrific - and the result of that experiment was, for lack of better description, really cool. For that reason alone I'll see the sequel. I just hope it's not another round of cowboys and Indians. <br />
B000003CKH|5.0|This album really was the breakthrough that put them on the map in the music world.  It's not some of their best work but its part of their history.  You will appreciate the songs such as \\"The Distance,\\" \\"Race Car Ya-Ya's,\\" and \\"Itallian Leather Sofas.\\"  Here is your chance to own an amazing piece of work.
0385334206|2.0|After reading Cat's Cradle, I was very excited to read another Vonnegut title.  After reading the many rave reviews of Breakfast of Champions I decided this would be an interesting choice.  I was very disappointed.  The only reason I even finished it was because it was an easy, short read plus I wanted to be able to write a review taking the whole book into consideration.  First, it is not funny.  I am befuddled as to how so many people found it funny. It just isn't.  Sure, there are a couple of somewhat funny comments but these are very few and far between.  Basically all he does is criticize our American society which I do not find offensive but he does it in such a direct, in-your-face style that it doesn't resonate with any humor.  It is like he just put down on paper some random thoughts and complaints about our society without putting any effort toward creating a cohesive theme.  The storyline itself is so fragmented and superficial and pock-marked with useless anecdotes and comments that after the first 50 pages I really lost all interest.  <br />     Now for the pictures.  He decided to draw pictures of everyday things that we all are familiar with such as a cow and a hamburger.  Now at first these were a bit humerous but after the first dozen or so they were very tedious and useless.  I found myself thinking \\"Yes Kurt, I know what a cow looks like\\".  I understand that he is pretending to be writing this commentary on our society to someone who is not familiar with our world in order to highlight it's contradictions, ironies and hypocrosies which are often times right under our noses but the pictures just got to be too much.  I finally concluded he used them just for filler for his very thin story.  <br />     There was also a lot of derogatory comments about African-Americans which obviously offended some readers but he also has other vulgar comments as well and these, I believe, were all included to do just that: be offensive and vulgar for no other real purpose because it sure didn't add anything to the story such as it is. <br />     I have not given up on Vonnegut however.  I plan on reading a few more of his novels but if they are anything like this one then I'm through with him.  Cat's Cradle was so much more funny, smart, well-conceived and subtle yet strong in it's message that I can't believe the same person wrote both but hey, I guess you can't hit a homerun every time and with Breakfast of Champions he certainly strikes out as far as I am concerned.  Of note, the author himself states in the book that it is a bad book so there you have it.
B0007O38F8|4.0|yo man i saw the bad reviews for this cd. man i think this cd was rated so bad becuz 50's fist cd was so gangsta that it would be hard for him to every top or compare to it. It would have to give this cd  4 outta 5 cuz 15 outta 22 tracks were pretty good and plus ya gotta show 50 sum love. so if ya like 50 go pick this sh*t up
1400032717|5.0|The most wonderful book i have read in years. Once i started i did not put the book down until i'd finished it.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I must confess that I would be remiss not to point out the cultural differences between Americans and Brits. As the former, I have no interest whatsoever discussing this movie as a spiritual experience or a deep love story. It is the world's greatest nightmare of MTV American style fable. I cannot believe Ewan did this film, in fact. Love is a construct. It is a contract based on social needs and norms and nothing else. Maybe in Tibet or with doped up people in Los Angeles or New York this movie could have appeal. Not with more sophisticated cultures such as the ones one finds in London and Paris.
B0007O38F8|4.0|First off, there's no way in hell 50 was gonna top 2003's \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" with \\"The Massacre\\" and that what all you thickheaded downraters need to understand. Secondly, he doesnt need to even make a good album, because the first one was so good and all the little kids will buy this anyways. Not to mention all the other cash cows(Lloyd Banks, Young Buck) on his label and his clothing line that guarantee his financial well-being.Its good to see 50 workin with some new and different producers this time around, Dre beats are gettin old-fast. If you want Dre beats, get the Documentary by The Game. The subject matter is the same as before but did anyone expect different? Personally I wanted a new ablum with some fresh tracks to at least replace the horribly overplayed In Da club in all the clubs and bars. In this regard, the album delivers with nicely with Disco Inferno, Candy Shop, Get in My Car, Outta Control, Piggy Bank, Just A lil Bit, I'm supposed to die Tonight. The rest is above average, borderline filler but still worth a listen.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|I bought De-Loused in the Comatorium last year on the advice from one of my friends, and the CD didn't leave my player for like six months.  Since then, I've been on the edge waiting for this sophomore project from The Mars Volta. I had pretty high expectations for Frances the Mute, and sadly, this CD falls short of them. <br /> <br />This isn't to say the CD is horrific, it's not. The Mars Volta bring out more of their Spanish influences, especially in the songs The Widow and L'via L'Viaquez. They incorporate more brass ensembles intertwined with guitar.  <br /> <br />However, within these new influences, there isn't much difference between tracks. Frances The Mute plays like one big song with very little division in between the various tracks. I was disappointed with how little actual music was on the CD. Most of the songs contain more disjointed periods of chaotic white noise, and jumbled instrumentals, rather than real meaty guitar riffs and Omar's and Cedric's amazing vocals reminiscent of De-Loused in the Comatorium.  <br /> <br />From the first song on De-Loused in the Comatorium, I was enthralled in the music. I've never felt so emotionally varied in one CD. However, Frances the Mute left me longing for that same feeling I got with De-Loused. The emotional power just wasn't there, and that causes the CD to suffer. <br /> <br />Fans of The Mars Volta and those who loved De-Loused in the Comatorium may be disappointed with the band's follow-up Frances the Mute. Don't expect to hear songs like Inertiatic ESP, Drunkship of Lanterns, or my personal favorite, Televators.  <br /> <br />Frances the Mute has its moments, but mostly seems more jumbled than De-Loused, and it lacks the energy that made De-Loused the powerhouse it was. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I guess I'll be one of the few that says that this album isn't the second coming of Jesus.  I mean, I like it and appreciate the creativity in the sounds...but they don't rise to the top as one of my favorite new bands as a result.  I still prefer the sounds of Interpol, The Killers, The Unicorns, etc.  It's a CD that I can listen to if someone has it on, but I didn't feel the obsessive drive to go out and buy it when I heard a song from it.  I completely disagree with the first review of them being way above and beyond Interpol.  This coming from someone who loves the 80's music, including The Cure, Depeche Mode, etc. etc.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|When I heard this CD was coming out, I thought \\"Oh great, yet another tribute album.\\" Don't get me wrong, I love Clapton and Robert Johnson, and I thought Clapton's blues tribute album From The Cradle was outstanding. But somehow I just couldn't get myself worked up about this. <br /> <br />And what a fool I was. A co-worker recently let me borrow this, and it made the work day much more tolerable to say the least. I think part of my problem was I incorrectly assumed that the CD would be just Clapton and his acoustic guitar, trying to be as faithful to the original Robert Johnson recordings. Instead, I was pleased to discover that he had top notch musicians working with him, including Billy Preston on piano. <br /> <br />From the first few notes of the first song, I knew I was in for a treat. On the second song of the CD, Clapton does a worhty and soulful cover of Little Queen Of Spades, my favorite song of Robert Johnson's. By the third song, a so-upbeat-you-can't-help-but-tap-your-feet version of They're Red Hot, complete with an awesome piano solo from Preston, I knew I had to own this immediately. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anybody that enjoys the blues, and/or listening to great musicians having a great time.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Dark, haunting, and disturbing....just like I like it.  They have a gloomy sound, yet they are such a classy group.  I'm not making any comparisons, as I think this band has their own identity and carries it well.  I've seen them in concert and they put on a phenomenal show.  This CD is just the start of a beautiful thing going on with Interpol.  The parallel guitars, strong bass line, and haunting vocals by Paul Banks make this a must buy.

B000069AUI|4.0|ok,well,i am obssessed with Chris Martin's voice,i really love his voice.although their songs are a bit melancholic,they can make you re-consider lots of things.i wish they would come to greece,where i live,and give a concert!!but i know that they are a pretty new group so it is pretty early to expect them to come.anyway,whenever they come,i will definitely go!!!!
B0007O38F8|4.0|Now honestly I do not know why so many people are hating on this album. When I first heard It i was slightly disappointed, but it grew on me like you wouldn't believe! 50's lyrics have improved on many songs, and the beats are ILL throughout the whole album, no matter what anybody thinks. If Hip-Hop is dying, then this is definitely one of the better releases in comparison to \\"Nelly\\" and \\"Lil Scrappy\\" so stop hating! <br /> <br />1.Intro (N/A) <br />2.In My Hood (4 Stars) <br />3.This Is 50 (4 Stars) <br />4.I'm Supposed To Die Tonight (5 Stars) <br />5.Piggybank (5 Stars) <br />6.Gatman and Robin (2 1/2 Stars) <br />7.Candy Shop (3 Stars) <br />8.Outta Control (4 Stars) <br />9.Get In My Car (3 Stars) <br />10.Ski Mask Way (5 Stars) <br />11.Baltimore Love Thing (5 Stars) <br />12.Ryder Music (4 Stars) <br />13.Disco Inferno (2 Stars) <br />14.Just A Lil Bit (2 Stars) <br />15.Gunz Come Out (3 1/2 Stars) <br />16.My Toy Soldier (4 Stars) <br />17.Position Of Power (4 Stars) <br />18.Build You Up (1 Star) <br />19.God Gave My Style (4 1/2 Stars) <br />20.So Amazing (4 Stars) <br />21.Don't Need Em (4 Stars) <br />22.Hate It Or Love It Remix (4 1/2 Stars) <br /> <br />There are just so many bangers on this album. \\"This is 50\\" offically sets it off with a SICK dre-sounding beat and 50's usual brag raps, which actually work well. \\"Outta Control\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\" and \\"Just A Lil Bit\\", are bonafied club songs and all have potential to be big hits in 50's future.  <br /> <br />For once, 50 actually hits us with CLASSIC material (i am not kidding). These being the haunting \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" and \\"Ski Mask Way\\", \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" and the incredible \\"Hate It Or Love It Remix\\" which loses half a point for Young Buck.  <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Get In My Car\\" and \\"Candy Shop\\" are average at best, as they are very catchy but contain watered down lyrics and not the best beats found on the album.  <br /> <br />Out of the thug-love tracks, I personally am feeling \\"So Amazing\\" which features Olivia's beautiful vocals.  <br /> <br />There are some horrid tracks, like \\"Build You Up\\", but the good outwieghs the bad. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is much more STREET than G.R.O.D.T, and has nearly ill production consistently, which is enough for the casual rap fan and even underground rappers to buy and enjoy.
1400043662|5.0|Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore is wonderful.  It has a dream-like quality, a sort of surreal sensibility that will transport you to another dimension.  The story of a young runaway, Kafka, who is in search of his missing mother and sister, is entrancing.  This novel is not for everyone.  It's weird--but I found it wonderful in its weirdness.  It is one, big existential dream.  Enjoy.
B0007O38F8|2.0|im sorry fifty fans but this album delivers very little. Get rich or die tryin was ok, but this album is nowhere near his mixtape quality when he first came on the scene. Recently fifty wants the game banished you know why? cause dre used all his good beats for the documentary and fifty was left with nothing for his sophmore effort. People say that the game has way too many name refrences in his album, well count how many times 50 uses gun refrences in his album. He aint the best lyricest either and he knows banks is better than him when it comes to lyrical quality. Finally people are saying how did u get to hear the album so early....ITS CALLED BOOTLEGG, go get one on your local street corner. So without further heres a track by track rating. <br /> <br />Intro/ 2-intros aint perfect and this one wasnt needed <br />In my hood/2-not good starter track and the lyrics aint great <br />This Is 50/3.5-good production and song is not half bad <br />Im supposed to die tonight/3-same eminem bassline but it works on this one. <br />Piggy Bank/3.5-great production but this is not even close to a diss track, one line for each artist he hates, nothing compared to back down. <br />Gatman and robbin'/1.5-this song is just plain bad, beat is bad, flow is bad too and eminem doesnt deliver. <br />Candy shop/2-song is not hot and scott storch's beats all sound the same (lean back, k-i-s-s me, hey he produces for the artists that 50 hates) <br />Outta control/2-a dre beat that sounds way too similar to higher in game's documentary <br />Get in my car/2.5-good beat by hi-tek but song is same old same topic that fifty spits. <br />Ski mask way/3-great beat but the song gets old quick (why does 50 need to take money if he made 50 mil?) <br />A baltimore love thing/3.5-another great beat, an actual good song. <br />Ryder music/3.5-same as baltimore love thing. <br />Disco Inferno/2-On fire part 2, gets old quick <br />just a lil bit/2-i swear i heard this song a couple of tracks ago, slightly better than candy shop <br />Gunz come out/1.5-barely listen to this song, just filler track <br />My toy soldier/2.5-not bad but \\"toy soldier\\"? whatever thats really gangsta??? <br />Position of power/3-good beat and thats about it. <br />Build you up/1.5-fifty never collaborate with jamie fox, not a good song <br />God gave me style/1-god didnt give u a good album <br />So amazing/2-rap-pop.....next!! <br />I dont need em/2-took the beat from ghostface's pretty toney album called \\"metal lungies\\", bad song <br />Hate or love it remix/1.5-another filler track, he did not need this track at all, save it for mixtape. <br /> <br />Well i hope fifty learns that he needs to step his game up and stop selling vitamin water and ugly sneakers. <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|If there was one band in this day and age that steps past the threshhold of what modern rock music has become, the Mars Volta is without a doubt that band, pushing their way to the forefront of what can be done with not only the music itself, but the most important part of all, the idea behind the album. Concept albums are not something new, but they are a from of musical expression where the musicians are able to build a theme around the music, and thus drawing the listener into their own story, making the album more of a full album than just; here lemme sit down and listen to this one great song.           Sounding like a clash between Frank Zappa's effective meddling in every musical instrument that he could find at his disposal ;(along with hiring well known musicians to play on his album with him, Flea for example on Frances the Mute) Using the pure audial bliss that Pink Floyd has achieved throughout their dablings in sound, as well as their theories about concept albums in general ;(listen to Wish You Were Here, or Dark Side of the Moon) this band refuses to fit into the modern rock cliche, standing up on their own two feet and differentiating themselves with others in way that puts 90% of the music out there to utter shame.           From beginning to end this album really is the epitomy of what can and should be done with music to move it onto the next level. While most bands stick with what they know best, and continue to do the same thing year after year, never really straying from the norm, and working with what sells best, The Mars Volta is not like the others and is more like the black sheep of the flock, refusing to adhere to any preconceived notions about what can, and will be done with music. However, although the Mars Volta is moving in the right direction with their music, and the ideas behind the albums, I hope that bands out there do not try copying their style, because then the industry will get clouted with copycats who I very much doubt will be able to hold a candle to this  blissful album.          If you have not purchased it yet, go out and buy it relax in your most comfortable chair, open up the album and read along with the lyrics (thankfully included) although if you know how to speak Spanish you'll be able to read along with it better than I did. Even if not though you won't be missing out as these parts are so over the top and intense that the album flows in such a seamless manner, and you can still get the drift of what is going on as the intermissions between songs help to bridge the gap between songs, while giving you bits of sound showing how the story progresses. Anyway though, pick this album up, you will not be dissappointed, as this is probably one of the most distinct and original albums that will come out all year long.
B0007O38F8|5.0|man this cd is good i mean 50 still got hot tracks like JUST A LIL BIT, GET IN MY CAR, I spoussed to die tonight, candy shop, piggy bank, disco inferno and the rest is still cool. so stop dissing him maybe yo just expect too much . you hate it or love it.
6301966562|5.0|This movie is a true treasure and is becoming harder and harder to find.  Good high-quality VHS copies are nearly impossible and the Laserdisc is basically a collector's item.   <br /> <br />The premise is silly of course, but the emotion and heart in this movie is incredible.  Combined with some truly great 80's music and vintage \\"cutting edge\\" graphics it is a complete package. <br /> <br />MD
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Freddie Mercury is mesmerizing in the live performance of Queen. David Bowie is absolutely electrifying.  This DVD needs to be seen by the younger generation, especially, to see what rock and roll is really like.   I didn't imagine it, our musical groups WERE better !!!   I'd give this set 10 stars overall.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This is the album classic metal fans have been waiting for. Like many other fans, I was nervous about this make-or-break Priest disc but the boys (well, they're in their mid-50s) really pulled it off well!! What a great recording. <br /> <br />\\"Revolution\\" is exactly what it seemed to be - a decent, if not spectacular made for radio track amongst an album full of top flight metal. Make no mistake - the rest of Angel of Retribution IS CLASSIC PRIEST! I personally think it is the band's best effort since Defenders of the Faith. If you were to rank all Priest studio albums from best to worst this would definitely be in the top half among other classics like Vengeance, British Steel, Defenders, etc.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are typical Priest lyrics - not Shakespeare but hardly cheesy ('cheesy' - a word used by people who grossly overestimate their own cool factor). No pointless profanity this time around. Keeping it clean and fun.  <br /> <br />Perhaps most relevant is that it blows out of the water everything put out by current bands like Slipshod, Please-Kill-the-Switch-Engage, Lamb of God-Awful, and Forget-the-Shadows-just-let-the-curtain-Fall. Why? Guitars in proper tuning, solos that rip and convey a melody, and perhaps most importantly there is A SINGER WHO HAS ABILITY AND TALENT INSTEAD OF A HACK THROAT-SHOUTER. <br /> <br />Last fall there was Megadeth's 'The System Has Failed' now we get 'Angel of Retribution' - classic metal is on the rise.
B000002OZY|5.0|\\"Tommy\\" by The Who is not only possibly the greatest rock opera of all time, but it also joins the legions of greatest rock albums ever created. The story is pretty simple: Tommy is born into a family where the father leaves for a \\"journey\\" while the mother cheats on him. When the father comes home, the mother and her new lover murder him, a traumatic experience for Tommy to experience. From this shattering experience, Tommy becomes the \\"deaf, dumb, and blind kid.\\" However, there is one thing Tommy is a genius at: pinball. Becoming a pinball master, Tommy finds comfort from the harsh reality that is world is, and in essence, becomes \\"free\\".    The album has songs that explain what is going on in the story, but there are some tracks that stand well on their own. Some of them include \\"Pinball Wizard\\", \\"I'm Free\\", and \\"Sally Simpson\\". This is the high water mark for The Who creatively. Though they might have come out with albums with stronger cuts or more hits, this is the peak of their creativity that was never equaled since.
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 man, you should wait for Dr. Dre man, you put an album like that man, that most be a joke man. Or I am still dreaming. 50 you rushed the album out man, and you are not even 3 stars from our reviews man... I am not hitting on you 50, but this is not hip-hop, Piggy bank is called out war man...! Please take Banks, Yayo, and Buck out of the hate it or love it, man leave it for Game son, they suck on it man... Wow, 50 I don't know which song that should be something to listen everyday man, because like their said before all sound the same, and you are not a boss, pretend to be are not a boss, wait for Dr. Dre to create what we call out real beats for you and then you rap, on track. The Game killed you man... This is album is dope even you running your little mouth, you wrote most of those songs, but The Game got a better chemestry than you 50 Cent, call JMJ again 50, asked him for a new way to rap son! I am fan in all man but this is not a G-unit album...
0441003257|2.0|First,  I've only read about 125 pages of this book so perhaps it has some dramatic improvements I'm missing...BUT overall it isn't very clever and it's rather uninteresting. There are pages of setup for jokes that fall flat. It's British so you may have trouble if you're American and don't know some British slang (Tubes are subways etc..) I have a pretty eclectic sense of humor and this book didn't appeal to any of the wide-ranging aspects of humor I appreciate- irony, sarcasm, wacky stuff, satire, wit, ..this had none worth mentioning.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Everyone hating on this cd is a dumba$$. You Fa gs didnt even wait for the real cd to judge it. You judged the bootleg one. What a bunch of idiots. If your a fan of G-Unit or not you will like this cd. Banks Buck 50 Yayo --- always true to the rap game and that aint goin no where. Hating a$$ bustas lets you yall pop off with a multi millionaire cd. Until then stop hating jealous asses.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I was a young man during the Vietnam war, and I can remember Robert McNamara on television talking about the war.  To be honest, I never liked the man at that time.  Like many Americans, I grew to believe that the Vietnam war was wrong, and McNamara was one of the main cogs in the war machine.<br /><br />This documentary puts more of a human face on the man.  Yes, he did participate in the planning of the bombing of Japan in WWII, and was Secretary of Defense in the Vietnam war.  But his lessons described in the documentary should be taken to heart by all Americans and especially politicians and leaders. In some portions of the film he appears to try and defend his actions, but only with partial success.  His eyes and his trembling voice belies the fact that he does hold himself at least somewhat responsible.<br /><br />For people who are working towards peace, this is a must-see.  For people that think war is the answer, it is also a must-see. A wise person once said (to paraphrase) \\"Whoever doesn't learn from the past is doomed to repeat it\\".  After watching this video and looking at the events of our time, it drives the point home even more.<br /><br />Watch it, realize that perhaps we are making the same mistakes that this man warns against.  Robert McNamara is obviously a very intelligent man.  What a waste that so much of that intelligence that could have been used towards the betterment of mankind, had to be used to facilitate the death of so many.  That is the lesson that can be learned from this film.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|By now, you already know that this is a great Cast Recording of a Fantastic show. I dont think you need another costumer review to comment on it.  However, I would love to mention that along with the fabulous leads, Joel Gray delivers a few wonderful numbers that live uo to his legacy.  Also, this is a good driving CD. Meaning, If you play it in the car, on a long trip, you can pretty much follow along with the story.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Brilliantly clever and orchestrated with a vengeance, SAW is one of the most disturbing psychological horror films of recent times.  Director James Wan and screenwriter/actor Leigh Whannel have concocted a somber and gory illustration of The Jigsaw Man, a serial killer who doesn't really kill his victims per se, just gives them options to avoid death.  From its stark opening in a really repulsive bathroom to its jawdropping finale in the same room, SAW weaves an intricate tale.  Cary Elwes gives an unusual performance, one that is at times wooden and unbelievable and at other times, so erratic and tense, he becomes frighteningly realistic.  Screenwriter Whannel as Adam, the other prisoner, also vacillates from sheer incredulousness to harsh believability.  Danny Glover is oddly cast as a police detective who has become obsessed with the case; Monica Potter has the brief role of Elwes' endangered wife.  The script does give us a plausible red herring, but I must admit the ending is a little \\"rushed\\", in that I'm not exactly sure how we're supposed to view its tragic resolution.<br /><br />But I cannot deny the impact of this strangely perverse, yet fascinating thriller.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I bought this CD on the strength of Jack Johnson's single \\"Taylor\\". This CD was definitely not a disappointment. <br /> <br />Jack Johnson has a very mellow tone that is very enjoyable to listen to. I was actually kind of surprised by how calming and relaxing this music is. This music is really hard to categorise, because it touches of many different genres. It's all blended together, and I can't really fit it into a category and blatantly label it \\"rock\\" or whatever. Sometimes there's even a Hawaiin vibe to some of the songs (which is probably because Johnson is from Hawai'i). I think that's part of the charm of Jack Johnson. <br /> <br />The whole CD is almost completely played on acoustic guitars (so if you don't like acoustic stuff, I would not suggest this!). Jack Johnson is great at writing riffs for guitars, and he has some mad guitar skills! <br /> <br />The highlights of the CD included \\"The Horizon Has Been Defeated\\", \\"Taylor\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"Cupid\\", \\"Dreams Be Dreams\\", \\"Holes to Heaven\\", and \\"Cookie Jar\\". Some of the songs are shorter than the average 3 to 4 minute song, but hey, they still sound good, so it doesn't matter. <br /> <br />For me personally, this is a lot different from other things I listen to. (Toad the Wet Sprocket, matchbox twenty, Better Than Erza, Chevelle, etc. has a much different vibe than Jack Johnson!) I think that even if you are used to listening to a \\"louder\\" kind of rock, you would still like this album. It's just plain good, so go out and get it! Everytime I listen to this CD, I find another reason to like it. I can't describe how great it feels to listen to \\"On and On\\", so you'll just have to buy it for yourself and find out.
B00005JMAH|1.0|I watched \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" once and never want to do so again. I am Potter book fan and one of many who detest the producers for the Harry Potter movies. If anything, \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" now stands as the worst of the three currently out.    The screenwriters massacred the timeline. Unless you've read the books, the myriad of plotholes will leave you confused. Nor is the acting the best. Although the souless dementors were portrayed nicely in term of their freezing a person to their very hearts, their flying made it lose the dark, subtle fear that represented the dementors. My criticism does not end here but I won't bore you with my outrage.     One can only enjoy the music of this movie and the setting if one can stand watching the movie without moaning in agony. And the new Dumbledore is better than the original but I'm biased because my initial mental representation of Dumbldore looked more like thie new actor.    Of the first three books, Prisoner of Azkaban was the longest by approximately 100 pages yet the fourth novel exceeds the others by 300-400 pages. After watching the first three movies, the destruction of the fourth movie will cause death of fans due to horrified disbelief. The producers butchered Harry Potter and if you are a fan of the books, save yourself the heartache.
076790592X|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. I read it in 2001, and it changed how I viewed a lot of things; this world, my life, my relationships. <br />In February 2004 I found out I have MS, and in doing the tests to see if I had MS, they found a cyst in my brain.  <br />After this, I had to reevaluate everything in my life. So again, I went to this book. It comforted me greatly. So now, when I am feeling down, or just need a reality check, I go to this book.  <br />I am eternally grateful to Mitch Albom for writing this book and sharing his experience with us.  <br />Thank you!
B000021Y77|5.0|Like an extended music video, Run Lola Run is one of those visceral movies that can be watched passively for while but before long it gets under your skin making your heart pound your lungs heave and your mind race.  Tom Tykwer's direction and writing turned out a fantastic film that is pure action.  This is a foreign film but its concept and style are close to home.  Using the universal appeal of driving beats, as well as techno tunes and fast action photography this film is one that immediately grabs hold of teens and young adults and older people too!  Franka Potente is powerful in this film.  She is aesthetically pleasing (as always) and really makes the film enjoyable to watch.  The dialogue is quite simple and you need not know a lick of German except maybe die tasche (the bag) which is a line used often throughout.   <br /> <br />The film is centered on a young arty couple who are in need of money to pay off a loan after getting the. I am not going to give away a single plot detail because it may make the movie less enjoyable.  However the movie is in fact three different scenarios of what happens in their pursuit of get back the money. Not all of these scenarios end happily.  I have always imagined the movie as the imaginings of the couple as they plan and go through the contingencies of getting money.   <br /> <br />Stylistically this movie is shot a lot like a music video and is more emotionally stimulating than is an intellectual one.   <br />Its adrenalizing driving feel is refreshing especially considering it is a foreign film.  So often foreign films are intellectual or just quaint. Not here. The only omission I would have made was the use of the animations that run in a few parts.  They aren't bad and do not heavily detract but they are a little bit like something out of the `80's.  But overall, the heavy use of high energy volume fast action shots, aggressive dialogue against a relatively austere urban German backdrop that accentuates the action makes this such a fun film to watch.   <br /> <br />Beware when watching this movie you will probably want to do some cardio and this makes a great one to watch while on the treadmill if you have such a set up. This movie is pumped with energy and is a great point of entry into foreign film.  It is one that is highly accessible very stimulating and good for a wide audience.  I highly recommend you see this one: Its style pushed the envelope of what a film can be and is truly  a masterpiece.  The DVD offers a few extras and English audio which makes it all the more easy to watch.   <br /> <br />-- Ted Murena  <br />
B000002UB3|2.0|A couple of good tracks like Because and the Medley on the second half. Content wise-utter rubbish. The Beatles recorded better whole albums then this. The half-assed effort on the last two productions is weak and they show.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|If you like bands like Maiden, Sabbath, and Dio you'll love this CD! It sounds original yet still remains true to the roots of metal. EXCELLENT!! 5+ Stars
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love Broadway shows and music, and this CD did not disappoint! Great music, great songs. The two female stars have amazing voices and sing with such emotion. They are excellent. You will find yourself playing this CD constantly, and singing along in the car. Wicked is a wonderful CD.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|There are so many sounds and styles blended together and the singer is HOT. Interesting music, even more interesting is that Evenescence has done well here in America but this band hasn't. Hmm. This is a wonderful CD, it's different, it's interesting, it kicks butt.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is one of the most challenging albums I have ever listened to.  That doesn't mean that it took me several listens to enjoy it.  Rather, this thing, for a \\"5\\" track album is incredibly complex and vast, with more layers than an onion, on par with Tool's \\"Lateralus\\" in terms of complexity. <br />My only complaint is that the track listings out there are terrible.  I almost returned this CD, thinking it was mis-authored, but after researching a bit, it seems that the movements of \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" and \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" were rolled into single tracks.  Also, \\"Cassandra\\" doesn't seem to actually be the remainder of the tracks (the number still won't add up to the 15 tracks, but rather reaches 12).  Instead, there seems to be a 6th track composed of 3 movements that I figure is the \\"Frances the Mute\\" listing shown under the CD itself.  Extremely confusing, but just throw the album in, and listen to it as a single piece, much like \\"Lateralus\\".
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is a fabulous movie that, if you find it at the very least amusing and laugh several times during the first run through, it will definately grow on you!  What several negative reviewers fail to realize is that not everyone is a beautiful pagent winner or jock with rippling muscles - perfect beings like most characters in contemporary movies and nighttime sitcoms are so BORING and overused.  At last, here is a movie about the weird, strange, deranged, and utterly REAL world that is as full of surprises as life itself!  Most movies today leave the viewer sitting behind a pane of glass, watching through the camera's eye and experiencing very synthesized, artificial worlds.  This one puts you there in Idaho, right into the twisted world of Napoleon Dynamite.  Those choosing to live in a fantasy perfect-world can avoid this movie.  As for the rest of us, and especially those who were ever ridiculed, tormented, or generally dissed for being who we were/are, SEE THIS MOVIE AT LEAST TWICE!!  And then, perhaps, bust a move on your own time just for extra kicks... :)
B0001GL3K4|1.0|The language was horrible and the nudity was unacceptable. These two components totally distracted from the dialogue and connections that could've been made with the characters. I'm ordering an \\"edited version\\" from another company so I can actually enjoy the acting and solid story line.
0385510454|1.0|I can't believe I actually made it through this book.  If it weren't for a few long planes trip, I have no doubt I would have stopped reading this book after the first 50 pages.  The book is basically a boring, cliched spy novel intertwined with a Italian tourist pamphlet.  And after you finish reading the rushed, hackneyed ending, Grisham basically admits he knows nothing about international espionage and explains that you'll just have to live with it.  So here's his message: I just wrote 350 pages of shameless, boring crap, but people like you will buy anything with my name on it, so thanks for making me rich.
B0007O38F8|2.0|Just when 50 said he wasn't gonna have a sophomore slump he did.  Relative to many albums out this album is trash.  He has the nerve to hate on Game, he's just jeolous because 50 knew coming in that his album couldnt hold a candle to came.  Every other song sounds the same, he talks about the same thing on every song, he sings almost every hook( a la Ja Rule), there isnt much to this album, but ryder music is a hot song, but if you're a true hip-hop fan, you will feel let down by 50.
B00005ASHM|5.0|When I was 21 or 22, one of my coworkers dropped a copy of Pet Sounds on my desk and said, \\"listen to it, it'll change your life\\".  Well, like anyone that age, I assumed he'd be wrong, but one late night years later, I did listen to it. <br /> <br />So anyway, he was right, it changed the way I thought about music, at a minimum.  Since then, you might say my obsession with the Beach Boys is complete. <br /> <br />The album--  13 tracks of just incredible, lush, essential music.  Much of it is Brian singing lead, and he does so magnificantly, in either a tenor range or falsetto, depending on the piece.  Where there's harmonies, they're sometimes drier than the previous stuff, sometimes as lush and well arranged, and sometimes there's none. <br /> <br />As far as the songs go, there's not a bad one-- highlights change for me over time, right now \\"You Still Believe in Me\\", \\"Don't Talk\\", and \\"God Only Knows\\" are my favorites, but this changes over time.  They're all quite brilliant though-- every time I listen to the album, I'm amazed how good it is, from the fragile lead vocal in \\"Caroline, No\\", the brilliant, layered tag on \\"God Only Knows\\", the mighty chorus of \\"Sloop John B\\", there's really not enough room in any one review to say what there is to say about this. <br /> <br />This is an album about growing up, about seeking adulthood, it leaves behind the childish themes of the older Beach Boys material that has maligned their reputation for a more mature viewpoint.  If you have a view of the Beach Boys and have not heard this, like I did before I heard it, you're missing out if you don't give this a chance.  I come from a jazz/progressive rock/avant-garde background, and while I had my own impressions of the Beach Boys, I learned how wrong I was. <br /> <br />Essential, if you don't own this, you should.  This may be the best pop album ever written.
B0006399FS|3.0|Hey, remember U2's \\"Numb\\" from Zooropa?  Wow!  The Edge couldn't be more terrible singing that song.  What were they thinking?  Then I heard \\"Babyface\\" and I thought, 'well, this is ok, but c'mon where is U2?'  Then I listened to \\"Stay\\" and I liked it.  Then I listened to \\"The Wanderer\\" with Johnny Cash and I thought 'ok this is different', and I liked that song, too.  And after rounds and rounds of Zooropa I could not stop playing \\"Dirty Day\\".  The band, and Bono's voice, make that song happen!  Very introspective tune.  You will never hear \\"Dirty Day\\" played on the oldies-but-goodies radio station. <br /> <br />I like How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, too.  The album is not as good as Achtung Baby.  It's not ingratiated with self-help songs like on All That You Can't Leave Behind -- hence, \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\".  \\"Vertigo\\" is a smash hit, but it's definitely a decoy in terms of the rest of the album as a previous reviewer pointed out.  And that may be the sole fault with the album.  The title and \\"Vertigo\\" seem to be a bit out of place.  Let's face it, U2 is old.  I'd like to see them take a different direction.  They don't need songs like \\"Vertigo\\".  I'll eat it up like candy, but it would be so cool to see them take a different musical direction, something more grown-up. Stop peddling to the teeny-boppers.  This why so many U2 fans feel betrayed -- because they feel left behind. (no pun intended)   <br />
B00005WVEK|5.0|Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a `fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell.

B0002XDODU|4.0|Being a huge fan of Rammstein's 2001 effort \\"Mutter\\", I was skeptical as to whether the kings of Teutonic rock would follow up on their break-through.    Popping \\"Reise, Reise\\" into my CD player, though, erased all doubts that the new CD wouldn't be as good as its predecessor.  Track-by-track descriptions follow:    \\"Reise, Reise\\" - Rammstein made sure nobody gets the wrong impression upon hearing the album.  They've put what (IMO) is the best track and the title track, right at the beginning of the album.  They make no secret that the base of the song is pounding gothic rock, accentuated by gothic lyrics and a lilting string ensemble.  The melody is incomparable.    \\"Mein Teil\\" - By far the most (sickly) amusing track on the album.  Hits you like a freight train.  Detailing the cannibalism case in Germany from 2003, it sports witty gems such as \\"Denn du bist, was du isst\\" (Because you are what you eat [think about that for a bit!]).  Sick and twisted, Teutonic gothic rock at its best!    \\"Dalai Lama\\" - The plotline for the lyrics roughly follows Goethe's poem \\"Erlknig\\".  The whole song has a very foreboding presence, this gets worse the later you go into the song.  A chorus comes in mid-way, adding to the seriousness of the situation, and eventually, the chilling climax.    \\"Keine Lust\\" - Rammstein's humor comes through in this one as well.  The song has a relentlessly riff and bang style with a strong beat.  The song's basically about being lazy.  \\"I would feel like it with big animals, but didn't feel like risking it\\" is one of the better lines.  I think we can all think of some time we felt this way.    \\"Los\\" - I was alarmed to find this track on a Rammstein album.  A clear departure from Rammstein's normal style, this song is cool and bluesy - there's even a guitar mimicking a harmonica on some of the choruses.  This song is perhaps more comparable to what you may hear from the White Stripes or Queens of the Stone Age.    \\"Amerika\\" - The new anthem to the vanguard of the free world.  This doesn't really seem like the bashing of American politics (something I figured Rammstein wasn't into, anyways); rather, it seemed to be about the perfusion of American culture all across the world.  That said, the song is pretty catchy.    \\"Moskau\\" - Another geographical song.  Instead of going after America, they go after Moscow.  The metaphores Till uses to describe the city as a woman are of literary interest.  The shouting in Russian complicates things, however.    \\"Morgenstern\\" - A more gothic song.  Heavy on the gothic chorus.      \\"Stein Um Stein\\" - Perhaps the darkest song on the album.  The choruses grind and gnash as the stones are used to build a musical fortress.    \\"Ohne Dich\\" - An amazingly beautiful piece.  Originally slated to appear on \\"Mutter\\", they delayed it to this album.  Good idea, IMO, since Mutter had 2 ballads as it was, and this album would have none otherwise.  They bring in the whole lot for this... Till's commanding voice, a full string ensemble, acoustic guitars, and even what sounds to be a mandolin.  The net effect is amazing, for those of you who like power ballads.    \\"Amour\\" - After coming off the high that is \\"Ohne Dich\\", \\"Amour\\" in comparison will sound a bit more worn.  The lyrics, however, are not to be missed... an excellent expression of the many sides of love.    --    Overall, I want to recommend this CD to anyone who's enjoyed Rammstein and Teutonic rock (especially the album \\"Mutter\\").

B0007O38F8|3.0|I think the Album is Decent. It will not sell 11 million but will probably sell 4-5 million just because of all the news that has been surronding him lately. He is definitely lacking Dre on this Album, but gets some decent work from producers like HiTek(who everyone sleeps on)- Best Track - Ryder Music. He definitely will not take a two year hiatus next time.  <br /> <br />I lot of this beef could be a plublicity stunt by Interscope. They are selling records off the chain. Why not stir something up to get all the interscope artist records selling. Remember alot of the artist that he's beefing with are on Interscope.. Wait and See... Pick up the Album...
B0007P3582|4.0|Yeah, people will say that this album is not as good as his first...which is true.  But let me say that statement is also true for the following albums: Nas, Snoop, BIG, Mobb Deep, Wu-tang, etc...you get my drift.  This album will not sell more than 11M, but it will definitely sell over 3M.  Anyway, none of that matters.  What matters is, \\"does it entertain you?\\"  I like his music, I can definitely rock to this.  I got a bangin system, and this album is nice.  Yes, Dre spent more time with The Game and not 50 for production, but honestly, Scott Storch blows Dre's beats out of the water on this album.   <br /> <br />'Disco Inferno', 'Candy Shop', 'Get in my Car', 'Hate it or Love it Rmx', 'Outta Control', and 'Just a Lil Bit' totally stand out first listen.  Others will grow on me, just like his previous album.  This album has potential for 5 singles/videos, fo sho! <br /> <br />I will not mention his fos, enemies or anything relating to hatin'.  It all comes down to - what you like and what entertains you, and this album is easily a winner.  Plus, I like my music loud and these songs bang!   <br /> <br />PS - I never got tired of 'In Da Club' and I will never get tired of 'Disco Inferno' and 'Candy Shop.'  G-G-G-G Go buy this!
B0007O38F8|1.0|This is by far the worst album I've heard.  I'd rather listen to the Ken Kaniff skits off of Em's albums.  This is ridiculous, this is the worse sophomore effort I have ever seen.  I think 50 could've done a lot better.  This was a huge disappoitment and I think some of his die hard fans would agree with me.  Nice try 50 but you are not good anymore.

0800128052|5.0|It's rare when a movie can affect the culture and vocabulary of a society.  Rudy is such a powerful and memorable movie that it has made such an impact.  The term \\"Rudy\\" is now used in reference to the bench-warmers on high school and college sports teams.  For example, if a team is getting blown out or is blowing out another team, at the end of the game, the coach might put in the scrubs who rarely get to play.  Seeing this, someone in the stands might say \\"Hey, look, the coach is putting in the Rudy,\\" or \\"The Rudys are coming into the game.\\"  There you have it.  A movie that has affected the way we speak and think about the players who spend most of the game on the sidelines.  Rudy (the movie) is entertaining, emotional, funny, and teaches a good lesson without being preachy.  The football scenes are great to watch too because they actually look real, unlike other sports movies.  And if you've ever warmed a bench (I have), you can take some solace in Rudy's plight.  I've never met a serious athlete who didn't love this movie.  A lot of people consider Rudy to be corny and cliched, but if you've been a Rudy, or if you've known one, then you'll see this movie for what it really is.  The casting is perfect, with Sean Astin giving what I consider to be the best performance of his career.  The music is also inspiring, and has been used in many other projects besides the movie. If you don't cry or cheer when Rudy puts the hurt on the opposing quarterback, then you might not be human.  Rudy is easily one of the best sports movies ever made, and continues giving comfort to mediocre athletes everywhere.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|So here I was wondering whether or not I would give this album a shot a couple of months ago...sure enough I did and I am very glad I did.     This Canadian act brings forth all types of musical genres into one simple unified entity. Part post-modern rock like Modest Mouse and Neutral Milk Hotel, to some elements that show influences from Gang of Four to Pixies and well...Talking Heads.     \\"Wake Up\\", an artsy rock track and the dreamy, according-laced beauty, \\"Neighborhood No. 2\\" are my personal favorite tracks. Frontman Win Butler and wife Chassagne, perform so elegantly together that their sweet vocals help establish the very distinct sound. \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" is a spastic, psychedelic delight, another track I am fond of, oh and of course \\"Neighborhood No.1\\".     The album is a demonstration of facing lifes' many perils but never being swept under with gloom. The life and death theme which is played out so heavily in music gets a new facelift here.    I am so impressed by this act and next to only Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\", I consider this THE best album of 2004.
0385510454|4.0|I basically liked the whole book, especially the part where marco was in Italy. Grisham managed to describe every sights that marco saw, and every food that marco ate very detailed. But when I read the ending, I feel like the ending was a bit rushed. Grisham didn't describe into detail of what happened after the meeting with the CIA. But overall it was a very good story.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I never thought Madonna could sing, and I especially don't think so now after this sad record. She's really gone down hill. Instead, I recommend a Beyonce Knowles or a Britney Spears CD. These two women are much more talented, and a lot easier on the eyes....
B0007O38F8|4.0|Anyone who likes what 50 brings to the table should go out a buy this album.  Filled with great hooks and flashy lyrics. If you are like me, you buy an album and listen to it from start to finish to get the full effect.  The best analogy for this album is what a great party is made of... This album starts off nice and slow (in reference to quality, not aggressiveness).  But it builds up to have some great tracks (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18 - are amoungst my favorite) and it finishes smooth and strong. The only reason why this does not get 5 stars is because only albums like \\"All eyes on me.\\" and \\"Ready to Die\\" get 5 Stars from me (just my opinion).
B00005ABX0|4.0|Really, I think these two so badly meeting expectations of the times have resulted in a slanted opinion of them.  Having the benefit of coming into the Beach Boys long after they were producing any new music, my perspective is different. <br /> <br />Smiley Smile was the hastily assembled album that came out instead of Smile.  Brian abandoned the project but had to do something, and honestly, as interesting as it is, its a mess.  The material can be broken down into three parts, the recycled Smile material, the rerecorded Smile material, and the newer stuff.   <br /> <br />The Smile stuff (\\"Heroes and Villains\\", \\"Good Vibrations\\", and the second half of \\"Vegetables\\") is all brilliant, extremely well executed, full of the expectations and complexity Smile brought. <br /> <br />The rerecorded Smile stuff (\\"Vegetables\\", \\"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\\" (a \\"Fire\\" rewrite), \\"She's Goin' Bald\\", \\"Wind Chimes\\", and \\"Wonderful\\") are all kind of a mess.  They're all really sort of underwhelming in their recording, in particular compared to the Smile stuff-- \\"Vegetables\\" is the worse of the bunch, the cut from the Smiley sessions to the Smile sessions brutal and easily noticed and makes the song difficult to digest.  \\"Wind Chimes\\" is performed in a bizarre creepy fashion (although it does have a stunning tag that ended up as an intro to the piece on Brian's rerecording), and \\"Wonderful\\" is so low key as to be soporific. <br /> <br />The new material sounds drug induced-- you get the impression that had the band not been totally stoned, this material could have been brilliant-- \\"Little Pad\\" and \\"With Me Tonight\\" in particular are just stunning, but both are marred by stoned inconsistencies. <br /> <br />\\"Wild Honey\\" is also a bit unappreciated-- it's really the Beach Boys do r&b-- much tighter and more focused music with dry harmonies.  The tracks that Carl sings (\\"Wild Honey\\", \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\", \\"Darlin'\\" and \\"How She Boogalooed It\\") are all incredible because of the strength of Carl's leads, and \\"Let the Wind Blow\\" may be one of the most passionate and beautiful pieces Brian ever wrote.  Bizarrely, the album closes with a leftover chant from Smile (\\"Mama Says\\" from the Smile take of \\"Vegetables\\"). <br /> <br />Bonus tracks on the twofer include the \\"cantina\\" edit of \\"Heroes and Villains\\", some early \\"Good Vibrations\\" material, H&V b-side \\"You're Welcome\\" (a great driving vocal chant), the a capella \\"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring\\", which is totally stunning, and five and a half minutes of \\"Can't Wait Too Long\\" sections, which was a later attempt at Smile-like music by Brian. <br /> <br />Overall-- the Smiley material is uneven but compelling, the Wild Honey stuff is a lot fun.  Highly recommended.
B000000H4V|4.0|I won't regurgitate every other review, but I will classify this CD as an \\"essential\\" for any metalhead. This was Sepultura, not becomming mainstream, but introducing new tribal sounding drums and themes within their music...which was a totally new sound, and a sound that Soulfly continues to use today very successfully.  <br /> <br />This CD holds up today as it's very aggressive and thrashy...but still tons of groove that seperate it from the faster speedy music of their previous albumns. Another CD that shows you could still be hateful and not blast 10000 beats a minute. Not only that, but the lyrical content is way above other bands, as they speak out against the oppression and stuff going on in South American.  <br /> <br />Roots had a couple of good parts, but a little too primative and tribal for me. ChaosAD was a great CD, and a good introducer into heavier bands. <br /> <br />
B000059QYB|4.0|The irony of punk - its prominence in the Billboard top-40, its safe-angst popularity and ubiquitous mediocrity - can trace its roots to the MTV staple and pop-icon that is Billy Idol. To wit: a movement all about rage and rejection, about being the \\"outsider,\\" would in a few short years be totally embraced by the mainstream, its image and aesthetic carefully packaged for those seeking easy rebellion; punk found the ultimate desecration in the man who sold out and sold big-time, the poseur who incorporated all the tics and trash-glamour, the posture and the sneer, swathing punk superficialities upon banal synth-rawk and deeming it good: Billy Idol epitomized the irony of punk - and the real punchline, of course, is that his music held more honesty in its playful hedonism, in its celebration of nothingness, than the resultant dirge-work of most of his \\"peers\\": the brute atonality of the Swans or the stupid misanthropy of the Fear; in that his music stands up stronger two decades later than all that oh-so-serious dross.  Pretty Vacant indeed!    Now that I've eliminated the hardcore faithful with these opinions, let us delve a little deeper into this fascinating figure, the man and myth that is the Idol.  It's been many years since I viewed Billy in his incarnation on MTV, gyrating suggestively on the stage, resplendent in punk clichs: the peroxided coif (so carefully mussed) and those crucifix-earrings, the leather pants and chest hair a-bristle, the Cali-tan and everpresent sneer augmenting his Aryan-worthy features: to those few of us that take pride in being pop culture navigators and sardonic social critics, Billy Idol is both a hero and a point of damnation, the savvy thief and hardcore necronerd Anti-Christ, someone to secretly worship and feel shameful about it.  It is thus interesting to note that Billy began as a \\"true\\" punk, attending Sex Pistols shows in his raconteur youth, playing part in seminal excursions like Chelsea and Generation X.  He left the latter band with one indelible single, 'Dancing with Myself,' power-pop with a lyrical punk motif.  Jury, turn your attention to Exhibit A: \\"Your empty eyes seem to pass me by/when there's nothing to prove and nothing to lose, I'm-a Dancing with Myself,\\" etc.  Spearheading the jaw-dropping oxymoron that is disco-punk, 'Dancing with Myself' refuted the origins of the genre (after all, punk began as a rejection of the soft rock sensitivity and disco-glut that dominated the late-70's) and established Billy Idol as the cartoon artiste, equal measure sex-swagger and romper-stomp, punk menace with a silly preen.  Simply brilliant!    *Rebel Yell* further refined the music and the stance, as Billy Idol embraced the Me-decade ethic of the 80's, defining the greed and excess and o'erweening confidence of the era via visual splendor and sublime lyrical poignancy.  Jury, I point to Exhibit B: \\"With a rebel yell, she cried MORE! MORE! MORE!\\" Says it all, folks. *Rebel Yell* contained the three-punch knockout of the title track, the blistering 'White Wedding', and the soulful 'Eyes Without a Face' that perhaps predict Billy's eventual incarnation as a Vegas crooner.  Indeed, examining Idol's roots and method - taking the sound of the downtrodden and exploited and using it as top-40 fodder - why, Idol was nothing short of a New Wave-era Elvis, a role he would come to embody and gleefully pay tribute to, climaxing with the 50's Stax/Volt mewlings of 'To Be a Lover' and 'Sweet Sixteen'.    The late 80's were not so kind to Idol: drug addiction put a low ebb to his creative fire, and this greatest hits package neglects the more edgy material of this period (such as a raging 'World's Forgotten Boy,' one of Idol's best songs) in lue of the borderline parody of 'Don't Need a Gun' or insubstantial fluff like 'Sweet Sixteen'...wait a minute, parody, fluff...perhaps I exaggerate, for it can be argued that ~all~ Idol's material is encompassed by these descriptive terms...but I digress.  Idolhad a major comeback in 1990 with the album *Charmed Life*, which produced the girl-writhing-on-the-bed video-hit of `Cradle of Love' and a cover of the Door's 'L.A. Woman' which (and I know this is considered unforgivable heresy) I prefer to the original: at least Billy comes off as sincere, in contrast to Morrison's very apparent drunken ramblings.    *Charmed Life* was Billy Idol's career peak, a fact given credence by this greatest hits package: only one song from the much maligned, ill-conceived *Cyberpunk* album makes the cut, 'Shock to the System,' and this compilation is rounded out by a live version of 'Rebel Yell' complete with acoustic guitar (!) and a hard-edged cover of Simple Mind's 'Don't You (Forget About Me).'  Yes, by all appearances Idol has now been relegated to `has been' status (greatest hits packaged are usually a sure sign of it), but then again, you never can tell... perhaps the current neo-retro trend that has dominated pop culture in the last few years will see a re-emergence of the Idol; the time seems ripe for ego-driven synth-rock to kick emo and sensitive-alternative in the seat of the pants, to establish male-centric posturing back into the Zeitgeist.       And I for one certainly hope so! It may seem by the tone of this review that I'm contemptuous of Idol's career, but I'm not so much disdainful as I am ~amused~, and, lest I forget, consistently entertained by the pop-gems the man has so meticulously forged.  Three-quarters of this packaged contains some of the most braindead delightful escapism the 80's have to offer, and I can never resist dancing with myself when the kick-drum hits and the guitars milk every last ounce of power-chord emotion; when coupled with Idol's catalogue of 'yeah!' 'babe!' and miscellaneous grunts, I find myself in nostalgia's seventh heaven.  It's certainly better than 90% of the power-punk on the charts these days: for Idol can be considered both the spiritual father and musical titan that these suburbia-hooligans, with their trendy tattoos and anatomically-correct piercings, aspire in vain to surmount.  Essential!
B0007GADZO|4.0|With time the ex-Zappa guitar wiz grows not just \\"wizzier\\" but Guru-ish. On this record he nothing short of lectures on the correct digital sound production, cute harmonization, spicy hot vocalizing, not to forget bursting out guitar and horns. The horn lines, for that matter, leave you gasping. Instantly bringing in memories of the early wonderful torch by Chase or Blood Sweat And Tears. The 70's vynil compilations on Warner label used to generate same tense erotic feel naturally, but Vai's might be its first implementation in modern computerized studio environment. What's even more important, this here seems the only instant of going to the extent of sparcing the trite hard-and-heavy formula with a twisted jazz-funk. Somehow, Vai has procured the longlost analog \\"presence\\" and eventfullness of encoded music. Vai's lineup are living and breathing guys, not a manipulated pulse graphic on a PC screen. I don't really know what stopped me from a 5 star rating. Probably, the derranged quality of an advance CD-R that Sony Music Russia forwarded for this review.
078322608X|5.0|This is the one of the very few that I will watch over and over again even though it is just so unfulfilling, does not live up to its promises, but produces such outstanding goods in the process, that the disappointment can be alleviated in knowing that not everything can be perfect... but some things do come close.<br /><br />12 Monkeys is probably Terry Gilliam's most mainstream film to date and certainly his easiest to watch, but that does not make it any the less twisty, arty, heady or off-the-beaten track, 12 Monkeys is absolutely all of that, and more power to it for being just that, with an A list cast of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, the question we are all left asking in the end is... why does Troy or Armageddon get all the best special effects? Not that 12 Monkeys lacks anything in terms of production values, or that we hate CGI in every movie we see, the stunning set pieces are jaw dropping, it never really does give us a kicker of an ending or the kind of budget finale that all its window dressing emanates, and even the more heady window dressing ending does not really stimulate the brain cells beyond saying - wow, amazing art, 12 Monkeys is that, but cloaked somewhat in a premise about the end of the world, the future, time travel, corporations, viruses, the Army of the 12 Monkeys, that is all very much worth seeing, but investing your time in answers turns out to be a big kettle of fish in the final few minutes. Not that it is a bad ending... just not what this kind of film really deserved, not that we mind things ending or a high or a low, but at least answering the questions poised would have added better closure to a great science-fiction masterpiece.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I found myself pleased with this cd after plenty of listens. However, this was mainly because certain of the songs are really awesome, while others are forgettable. The great ones: The Package, Weak and Powerless, Blue, The Outsider, and maybe Pet. Overall, a good album, worth owning, but no legend in the making.
6304884419|4.0|De Niro directs this. It is not perfect, but it is old and the budget is some restrained considering. It is nowhere near anything like Goodfellas, but works like Carlito's way. This film has smarts but it is old, independent and the film transfer is not perfect. Not everybody in this film is a professional actor, including some of the leads, making it a mixed bag at times, but none the less has its moments, and all these mobster movies are about those moments, and to be honest this can stand along side something like Casino from Scorsese no problem because of that.<br /><br />Chazz Palminteri who you know from The Usual Suspects, wrote the story about a boy who grows up between his straight family and the crooked mafia, learning the ropes from both, it is all about choices and consequences, and as others have rightly noted, whole heaps of morality minutes, as killer gangsters try to tell a kid how to hit on a girl, there are some background stories to this plot that work out quite well, not as soppy as let's say Steven Spielberg started tugging your heat strings with John Williams standing in the background with a violin, but it ain't as if Joe Pesci's Tommy would be teaching us how to dance if he didn't have a gun.<br /><br />It is worthy of any collection, but just don't go breaking out this DVD as the best mob movie ever. It is a long shot away from the classics but isn't as garbage as say Sly Stallone trying to do the mobster thing. Now there is 1, 2, 3 star territory.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I was gonna call my review \\"The Ghost of Thom Yorke\\" ('cause I'm clever like that), but other reviewers have all mentioned the similarity to Radiohead's sullen mumbler. So... <br /> <br />Let me say something. How ya sing is how ya sing. It's rather hard if your voice sounds naturally like Thom Yorke -- or Prince or Waylon Jennings or whomever -- to NOT sing like that person. So Muse's singer sounds like Thom Yorke. End of story. He -- and the band -- should not be slighted for it. (I remember reading about Pete Townshend striving to find a \\"different\\" voice because he didn't like the rather high voice he has. After a bit of struggle - and urging from others - he just figured \\"forget it\\" and went with his natural voice.) <br /> <br />Now the music. This album is SO oversized, huge, bombastic, dense, thick and ornate. It almost makes you chuckle sometimes -- like you can imagine the band being a bit cheeky and saying (in the studio): \\"Not theatrical enough. Put in another crashing piano and guitar filigree\\" -- just to get a rise out of the listener. Queen is another band that gets mentioned in reviews of Muse. And yes, Muse, like Queen, slip into purposeful histrionics sometimes.  <br /> <br />\\"Absolution\\" rocks. The musicianship is fierce and inventive all around. A real blast to listen to.
0446389234|5.0|Frank Miller opens this absolutely must own graphic novel classic from 1987-88 by telling us that if the only Batman we remember was Adam West on Saturday mornings, then we do not know the Batman he once met, a much darker batman, a more real batman, the kind of Batman that Tim Burton would succeed somewhat in bringing to the screen in 1989, but Batman: Year One is just so much better in so many ways, and probably will remain better than any movie or television program you can expect to see or have seen. If you want to know Batman, then you should really be meeting him right here.<br /><br />I especially like the Batman: Year one story. It is an excellent beginning, lots of in-jokes and capturing moments, even on-the-edge of the seat suspense, almost 100 pages of intense artwork. It is about the beginning of Batman like you have never seen it before, but also and probably more importantly, includes the beginning of Commissioner Gordon, a Lieutenant Gordon here, with a pregnant wife, who comes to Gotham City and finds his whole department on the take. The millionaire Bruce Wayne, has been training to become a vigilante since his parents where murdered by a gang of thieves. It is a psychological condition of revenge. He is trying to find the right formula to scare his victims. When he does, he goes up against the same criminals and kingpins that Lieutenant Gordon finds himself up against, no Jokers or Penguins here, but regular underworld types making it all the more level-headed, and thus a more accepting Batman and story. Batman fails in first few attempts, but manages miraculously to survive and continue on, both Gordon and Batman building their careers as crime fighters in Gotham City throughout the pages, a surprise bonus Catwoman introduced in the final act which sees the new crime-fighting duo of Batman and Gordon finally meeting up, without any sign of Robin among the 96 pages, this is certainly an alternative Batman and probably the best one. Miller's look is a murky color bleeding hard edges and smears, resulting in a Batman graphic novel that takes your breath away. The action sequences are better than any movie I can think off to date, your eyes go wide open from frame to frame as this is the kind of animate Batman you have always wanted to see in action. It is not the kind of high quality artwork you see in advanced graphic novels, this was a series character that had to meet publication dates, but is still gloriously presented none the less. Just check out the sequence with Batman in the burning building fighting the SWAT team. It is the end of Chapter Two and most of Chapter 3. That is some of the best action sequences you have ever seen committed to the page.<br /><br />I would suggest that you also try and get \\"Batman: The Dark Night Returns\\" as that was the other Batman graphic novel and \\"Batman: The Dark Night Strikes Again\\", totally different types of art to Year One, as these are both Frank Miller's work, the sequels to Batman: Year One, are mostly other artists, DC comics has a list at the back, very interesting ones at that also, like Alan Moore's Batman: Killing Joke, but get all of Miller's Batman before you try any other Year One or Year Two books. I would also recommend that you actually try a BEST OF GRAPHIC NOVELS before you venture down any path. And for those who are hearing that they must read and see some graphic novels to get to know Batman, let me ask you this. Do you like to read? Do you like movies? Then why don't you try Graphic Novels? Comics you say? Don't say that. This stuff is art. Do you like to read? Then why not Graphic Novels? Do you like movies? Then why not Graphic Novels? Why not?

0312305060|5.0|The Hours is an amazing piece of work.  Some reviewer down below stated that this was bold but not original because it was a copy of Woolf.  I think, if anything, this book is original.  It is a tribute to Woolf's genius, yes, but the story itself is all Cunningham's.  The writing style, the themes, the portrayal of characters, while being similar to those in Woolf's works, are very much Cunningham's own. <br /> <br />This book is really something-- I strongly recommend it to anyone who's got a few hours on his hands.  :)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I watched this at home, and had to wait a few days until I could watch it again.  This movie makes you think, and slightly disturbed me.  I had to allow for 'processing time' before I could give it a second go.  Do not get up to go to the bathroom, try to talk to your friends about the movie while watching this movie or anything.  If you have a fear of large rabbits, don't watch this.  If you don't fear rabbits, you may afterward.   <br /> <br />The basic story is about Donnie Darko, a sixteen-year-old boy diagnosed with schizophrenia.  He talks to a very large and very creepy rabbit named Frank that predicts the future.  That is what to tell people when you just want to give the short version of this story.  The long version requires a rabbit suit.  To really understand the story line, you have to watch the movie multiple times and listen to the commentary and all the extra stuff and the maybe, just maybe you might kind of understand what really happened.   <br /> <br />Please do not let this deter you from watching.  The movie is well acted and the story is intriguing.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance I have seen from a young actor in a very long time.  He utilizes his posture, voice and eyes to convince you that he is Donnie Darko.  His mother, played by Mary McDonnell, is excellent.  In response to Donnie's despairing question \\"How does it feel to have a freak for a son?\\"  she simply responds \\"It feels wonderful.\\"  That is the most reassuring thing any parent could possibly say.  Donnie's older sister is portrayed by Jake's real-life older sister, adding to the plot-necessary sibling rivalry beautifuly.  This is Richard Kelly's directorial debut, and he has made his mark.  I fear that his next flim will not live up to the expectation left by Darko. <br /> <br />Every character in the film serves a secondary purpose.  Frank the rabbit is Donnie's unconcious mind.  The teachers that Donnie likes (played by Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle) serve as guides to help him understand time-travel, responsibilty, girls and that nothing is simple.  The one teacher that thinks Graham Greene was a star on Bonanza is a reminder of the failings that all human beings have.  Kelly couldn'tfind a company to release the movie because no one was sure how to bill it.  The back of the DVD box says a 'psyclogical thrill ride', but that falls short of what the movie really is.  Of course, 'a sci-fi dark romantic horror thriller comedy fantasy religious story about being sixteen and having an imaginary pshchic rabbit freind that scares and intrigues you and makes you go sleep golfing' is too wordy for the back of a box. <br /> <br />This film has been released twice to theatres (both times limited areas) and didn't do remarkably well either time.  On DVD, it has become a cult classic of sorts.  IMDB lists Donnie Darko as the fifth most requested sci-fi movie of all time.  Simply, this is not a theatre movie.  I don't know anyone who hasn't watched it at least twice, usually more times than that in search of answers.   <br /> <br />Watch it, and then find a creepy rabbit to help explain it to you.

It's a much better overall collection than the single domestic CD, however I agree with the reviewer who noted the sound quality could be better on the older tracks.  Also, if you don't already own it, pick up Fullfillingness First Finale.
B000002H70|5.0|Just the third album I have tried, and I think I'll be buying more soon! <br />I love the sound they've managed to create on this. <br />\\" Lulluby\\" This song is so haunting, I can't stop playing it. Love the lyrics too. I can picture it so clearly in my head. <br />I also have : \\" Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me\\" and the types of songs seem to be quite similiar. <br />I have to listen to more of their earlier stuff, as I love the early singles on the greatest hits album, the only other album of theirs I own. <br />They definitley have their own distinct sound, and this is a great album, Worth a listen!
B00009V7P8|5.0|I've listened to this album now for 6 days! And I'm in love with it! It has some of the most beautiful songs, I've ever heard. I'm not a big musical genius - but I know what I like - and this I love. It's so varied and simply a work of art. Try Damien and you will not be sorry!  <br />By the way - great music to calm you after a stressfull day!
0743420373|4.0|I love wealth creation books, and character improvement books.  This one explores the common misconceptions about the habits of wealthy persons, mainly self-made millionaires and business people.  The book also gives results of interviews with some of these wealthy people answering questions like \\" How much did you pay for your most expensive watch, suit, car etc\\"  It also offers a fascinating insight into how many business people accumulated their wealth.  A real thought provoking book!
068987474X|5.0|<br /> <br />I just finished this book and it was well eye opening...I think because we know everything they say but we like to pull the wool over our own eyes and pretend, rather than think someone isn't that into us!  It was bold and to the point with humor mixed in and I enjoyed it.  It helped me understand that these rules should go for friends also, because if you are have mixed feelings about a friend maybe you should read this too, as I got a lot from it about my friendships too.  So I got double the dose from it.  I think it is a great book for people who just can't get over that guy.  And my favorite chapter was on shouldn't I be able to find out why he left me...and it is true if we pursue him it is just saying we are needy and are not strong enough to be on our own.  I know I kept asking the same questions as many of the people in the book, but I kept getting the answers I needed but were just to afraid to hear.  It is not the Holy Bible but it is common sense that most of us need to know in order to be strong and when the time is right our \\"Mr. Right\\" will come along.  We all have to learn patience and that not everyone we date will be our future husbands we have to realize some are learning tests.   <br />
0312995423|4.0|I found this book just as fascinating as \\" The Da Vinci Code\\" <br />The topic alone of Cryptology could keep me entertained for hours! All readers should bear in mind that Dan Browns books are fiction, readers have to decide what's real and what's not unless they are experts in that field. <br />I found the story highly plausible and imaginitive, and with continuing clever twists. As usual the decriptions of the settings were very entertaining. <br />Character depth can be notoriously difficult to create in thrillers without making the characters sound so corny. <br />It's probably one of the hardest genres due to the authors effort to create a fast paced novel that matches the topic. <br />A thoroughly enjoyable read for mine!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|i went in expecting a great movie and thats exactly what i got
B0007P3582|4.0|Well seeing as how I'm an upcoming producer (Working Underground In Oakland), I recognize talent. This album shows some of 50's talent, but with the guess performences he does on other people's Albums, I think his albums could be better. I guess that only applies to a few tracks to this album though.  <br /> <br />I didn't have any respect for 50 when \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" came out. I didn't like his flows. the only thing I liked about that album were the beats. I would slap that album over and over again because of the beats hoping that I would start to like him, but it didn't work. Then I heard this album. Now I'm not gonna lie, I'm still into the beats more than his flows, but he came alot better on this album. <br /> <br />There are a few tracks on here that I just can't stand, like \\"GATman and Robin\\", that song is just annoying. I also can't stand \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\", but only beacause they're singles and the get played out. \\"Gunz Come Out\\" and \\"I Don't Need Em\\" aren't really good either. <br /> <br />As for the songs I do like...or the best tracks rather, My favorite is \\"Get In My Car\\" I don't know why, but it is. I played it like 60 times after I heard it the first time, which was this morning so basicly I played it out and got kind of sick of it, lol. It'll be out of my head tomorrow so it'll be just like hearin it for the first time again, only I will only play it like....I don't know....twice maybe. Anyway, \\"Position Of Power\\" is a cool song. \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\", \\"Ski Mask Way\\", And \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" are cool too. I liked \\"Hate It Or Love It\\" from The Game's Album, but only for 50's rhymes and the beat. I don't like Game. So the remix is better on this album, just take out The Game and Tony Yayo, and the song would be better. <br /> <br />So I give this album a 4, which is suprising to me because I never use to like 50, but now.....well I'll just say I like this album....his next album might be wack so I'll just stick to saying I like this album. Yep 50, thats right. You gotta have at least two good albums to earn my resect!!! Good job on this one though.
B0007O38F8|4.0|After seeing J. Jones writing 50 cent wants to be like Ja Rule, I had to write something. First of all, Nobody needs to be insulted like that. Justin Timberlake is a bigger gangster than Ja Rule. Ja Rule had a good first album and then started making crap. I do like 50's new album, even though he dissed Jada and Nas. Oh yeah, another example on how Ja Rule is a dumbass, Murder Inc. rejected The Game when he approached them. I guess we know who the smarter group is.
B000021YQV|2.0|There is only 2 good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time. This is depressing dreadful music I wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead I broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
B0007O38F8|1.0|When you go into that record store you go to, and you see the new 50 Cent album, walk right past it.  It's wack!
B000005RFQ|2.0|There are only 2 good songs on this album. The rest of it is a bunch of anoying yelling and guitars. Why can't Tony ever give up on Black Sabbath and do something new. Without Ozzy Sabbath is a piece of crap.
B0007O38F8|5.0|75% of those reviews are probably people either pissed about The Game getting booted. PiggyBank really just being a slap in the face to those MCs in question to come at him, haters/ the same guy doing random reviews over and over. <br /> <br />Best CD, lyrically he is getting better and more tuned into what the people want to hear. Not as agressive as Get Rich, but thats what the mixtapes are for. Man can the same guy loggin into his 50 accounts quit being a lil kid and actually buy the album then review it. LOL bet u they dont even have it and they are dissing fiddy
B000001GQY|5.0|I had heard this was an excellent recording--and since Gilels is one of my favorite pianists, I bought this despite already owning two other versions of Brahm's two piano concertos. When I first listened to the opening movement of the first concerto, I was surprised. I hated it! I wanted my money back. It seemed way too slow, too ponderous and at times too sleepy and quiet. Then it occurred to me that I had had the exact same reaction that greeted this work at its premiere performance. As I recall, even the conductor didn't care for it, and the work was even hissed. Brahms got over it. So did I. When I listened the second time I couldn't imagine why I didn't like it. The more I listened, the more it agreed with me. This is indeed one of the best recordings of these works. The sound is excellent and has great range. It's full of sparkling clarity--never muddy.  From the angry and intense growl of the opening drums, through the hush of profound poetry that came in gentle waves of love and truth, the range and personality of the instruments is superb.<br /><br />Gilels playing is very moving. There is thoughtful subtlety and contrast here. The 2nd is full of the dramatic muscularity and passion that people have come to expect from this work. Excellent stuff. The Fantasien, capriccios and intermezzos make this 2 CD set a bargain. Buy it.
B0007P3582|4.0|One thing that stands out in 50 Cent's album The Massacre is how funky the album is!  Loads of club songs, especially on the first 7.  The Gattman and Robin song is so funky!  Piggy Bank sounds a little bit like P.I.M.P. and its Jamaican rhythms. I hope that 50 puts Outta Control as a future single--that should have been the album's first single instead of Candy Shop. Control has more muscle and 50 gets very much into it. I like that he has singer Olivia on Candy and So Amazing--this just builds momentum for her upcoming album on G-Unit. (I didn't like her J Records debut.) The typical gun-themed songs are here again, but 50 puts more depth in his lyrics instead of the tired themes of most gangsta rappers.  The album seems to be split into a few parts--the street songs first, the club numbers next, a few gun related songs, then to positive, clean spiritually driven songs before returning to his rough style on the final few songs. I also like Get In My Car, Ryder Music (good car driving song to cruise to), Disco Inferno, In My Hood, Supposed to Die.., Hate it or Love It and others. Baltimore Love Thing is very well done by him.  Liked Bring You Up with recent Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, but the song's too short for 2:55.  50 has a unique formula for his songs and that's why 3 of his songs are in the top 10. Dr. Dre and Eminem produced good songs here, but the Scott Storch, C Styles/Bang Out, Hi-Tek, and Jonathan Rotem (whose two songs on here I love) songs, give the big names a run for their money on this album! It's very diverse, funky and he has something for everyone on here, from the controversial and explicit to his more cleaner side on this album. He is one of the best in hip-hop at this moment.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'm a late comer to the Alice in Chains scene.  I never listened to any of their songs until 5 or 6 months ago.  After listening to their Unplugged album, I was hooked.  Now I have every album they've ever made (Except the Box set, I only have the Best of version).  And Dirt is definitely the best of the bunch, but that's not to say that the other albums are lacking.  Every one has its own moments of greatness. <br /> <br />Beginning to end, there isn't a single song that gets skipped.  They're all amazing. <br /> <br />And while Layne can never be replaced, hearing that Alice in Chains got back together to raise money for the Tsunami relief efforts just gets me all excited.  I'm really hoping they'll produce another album.  Maynard James Keenan did a great job with Layne's parts.
B0007O38F8|4.0|with all of 50s extra controversy, its hard to just listen to this disc for its musical content. But putting all of the other stuff out of the way this is a pretty good effort from 50. The content of the album goes deeper than get rich or die trying, its not just boosting about having it all but giving some insight on certain topics. Baltimore Love Thing and God Gave Me Style or evidence of that. I wish people wouldnt give to much credit to all the beef since 50 really doesnt sell of the beef records (in da club, Pimp, Disco inferno and candy shop are all club bangers not beef records) So the content goes further than all the contreversy and as a whole it is a decent album. <br />best songs <br />this is 50 <br />Im supposed to die tonight <br />outta control <br />ski mask way <br />gunz come out <br />god gave me style
B00074CBMY|5.0|Several years back when Tina Turner was winding down her fairwell tour, Joe Cocker was opening act for Tina Turner (imagine seeing those two legends all in the same night!) at The Staples Center...had to go, never having had the honor of seeing this great singer in concert whom I have enjoyed since classic masterpiece \\"Mad Dogs And Englishman\\". Phenomenal from opening number it was clear Joe Cocker a total artistic master in full command of his craft, Joe Cocker received numerous standing ovations on that great and memorable evening making it clear Joe definitely had another extraordinary recording forthcoming, this \\"Heart & Soul\\" is it and quite possibly the finest to date from this amazing singer whose brilliant career has spanned decades and still going strong! \\"One\\" is a tremendous and moving opener simply breathtaking in every way with Joe Cocker's deeply passionate vocal defining what great soulful singing is all about. \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\" is darkly haunting and another stunning masterful vocal going deep inside this standard with a brilliant arrangement featuring Jeff Beck making this smoldering then soaring version definitive, ultimately classic collection is filled with definitive great soul-stirring performances. Surprised reading some weird negative reviews of this great set that is filled with peerless performances, guess there are those around who can't comprehend deep performances as contained throughout this mind-blowing collection...great songs so incredible making it hard to get all the way through this stunning collection because of excessive use of repeat mode...were these people really listening to this soul-stirring collection of riveting performances? If so afraid something is really missing with the possibility of a much needed sound system update, whatever it is leave this fine collection to be savored and enjoyed by those who want to experience one of the greatest ever male performers captured in absolute peak form, giving wondrous soul-stirring performances making this a collection worthy of numerous \\"Grammy Awards\\", a timeless classic treasure to be enjoyed over and over again, this amazing collection of extraordinary performances is a stunning masterwork!<br />\\"What's Going On\\" has a wondrous ethereal arrangement flowing with an edgy feel, then that sterling vocal so extremely moving making this sound like a huge \\"hit\\" all over again...ditto a very soulful and rocking \\"Chain Of Fools\\" a totally wild & rousing funky jam. A soul-deep haunting vocal make \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" another Cocker masterful reading of a Beatles song that he makes completely his own much in the same way \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" became a riveting tour-de-force concert highlight at The Staples Center. \\"I Keep Forgetting\\" has never sounded quite as bluesy and great and \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" is a mind-blowing performance starting with stunning voice only opening flowing in to Joe giving the performance of a lifetime, great bluesy piano against majestic guitar work by none other than Eric Clapton, this stunning version of an old classic is the topper of them all, both Masters are in sublime peak form making this a truly riveting experience!  Throughout wonderful \\"Heart & Soul\\" magnificent arrangements match the great vocals, another example the stirring \\"Every Kind Of People\\" going straight to the heart of the song bringing it to life in a deeply moving way. Magnificent stirring edgy arrangement make the beautifully haunting \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" a bluesy classic with a sublime Chris Botti jazzy trumpet solo working magic with Mr. Cocker's amazing vocal, glorious in this brilliant multi-layered masterpiece that would get my vote for single release, tremendous performance is totally awesome!!! Never has James Taylor's \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\" sounded quite as soulfully magnificent as it does here, John Lennon is done proud with this funky and rocking \\"Jealous Guy\\", showing it would be great if Joe Cocker recorded an all Lennon-McCartney collection that would easily become an instant classic...PLEASE!!!!!!<br />Listening to the closing \\"Everybody Hurts\\" it is clear nobody around today can get inside a song with so much feeling and passion with a great sounding rough soulful voice that is a once in a lifetime treasure, now at its absolute peak this is truly \\"Heart & Soul\\" at its deepest and finest!  Thank you Joe Cocker, you really did it all this time, us music lovers are truly grateful!  As if this studio masterpiece isn't enough, a live concert Bonus Track of \\"One\\" becomes the stunning closer, showing nobody alive can do it quite like this guy...ENCORE with \\"More Heart & Soul!<br />HEART & SOUL TOUR UPDATE; Joe Cocker rocked LA at a sold out & soul-ed out performance at The Wiltern Theatre in totally awesome form singing old and new classics in really great voice that matched the quality of his vocals on this great new CD.  This is the tour to catch Joe on as he has never been better and his band is hot and really cooks making this event the party of the year!
0060763280|5.0|I know alot of people have different opinions about this book; however, I know several techniques that the author mentions that really work.  It is all about attitude.  My \\"adopted\\" mom once told me about how your subconscious mind must be trained to believe that you can be anything you want to be.  I kept telling myself that I was going to change my thinking about how my life was  to turn out.  It worked within a year.  I mapped out a plan that I would be a successful author and a business owner.  I now have a very successful business and my latest novel, \\"Leaving Lancaster County\\", sold more books that any other for my publishing house for November, 2004.  I am going on a two-week tour in Indiana and Illinois this month. So, believe me, if you only learn a couple of the techinques noted in this book, it will be well worth your buck.  People who don't believe-go ahead and laugh.  Those that want to dream- buy the book.  For dreams do come true!

B0007O38F8|3.0|Ok people, its obvious that this cd is not as good as get rich and die trying and to be honest with you is just a average cd. <br />Piggy Bank, Get in my car are good songs but the others lack lyrics and good beats all in all take it as a lost and work on new material.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the most intimate and truthful novel I have ever read. It is not often that an author can captivate a teenage reader, but I believe Stephen Chbosky has done it with his debut novel. Charlie is unique, yet incredibly easy to identify with. I know that I was certainly able to relate to several of his encounters. The intense crush you cannot get over; the unfamiliar, more mature experiences that come with high school; those two best friends and that infinite drive - I felt as if I were watching my own life happen on paper. Charlie seems to say everything I would like to, but can't express.  <br /> <br />Because the song was that great and because we all really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way. I have since bought the record, and I would tell you what it was, but truthfully, it's not the same unless you're driving to your first real party, and you're sitting in the middle seat of a pickup with two nice people when it starts to rain. 33 <br /> <br />That is one of my favorite quotes from the book and I'm sharing it because when I read it, I had a distinct flashback directly followed by a fulfilling moment, where I had finally found the words to describe my life. This type of moment continued to occur until the last page of the book. I loved how Chbosky tied every theme he touched on in with one another. What I took away from the book was a sense of comfort that at least one adult understands my generation and one kid goes through what I go through. Sure, he's fiction, but to be honest, I forgot that while I was reading because that is how realistic the novel is. Coming from a girl who normally regards reading as a burden, this book was different from any other I've read and I could not put it down, nor could I stop quoting it. The Perks of Being A Wallflower was a quick read that I wish lasted much longer. <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|The film was everything that the commercials made it out to be and better. Don't be one of the many of people who saw the film and took it for face value. If you've ever been in love, felt lost, been alone or wanted to fall in love at first sight, you will be able to find some emotion in this movie you can relate to. The movie can have the power to blow you away from the many emotions that they hit on, don't let it. If you're open (and chose to not let the funny/dirtiness get your prude side), then you'll love everything about this movie.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I have no problem with 50 cent. I enjoy most of his work from his beginnings on the 8 mile soundtrack to get rich. But this is crap. How about some NEW lyrics instead of g-unit and gats? The beats are junk compared to his last cd and it lacks any continuity at all. Do yourself a favor and check out Jadakiss or Obie Trice. They blow this clown away lyrically.
B000002KLG|5.0|George Benson's Qwest/Warner Brothers album \\"Give Me The Night\\" is a slamming album.  I heard this album when I was just a kid. <br />Love X Love is a slamming track.  \\"Give Me The Night\\" is just as good.  My favorite is \\"Star Of A Story\\".. Eerie sounds with heavenly vocals.  The background vocals which accompanied that sound was Patti Austin, Diva Gray, Jocelyn Brown, Tom Bahler and Jim Gilstrap.  With the heavenly vocal cameo of Patti Austin on \\"Star Of A Story\\"  it gives the song a holy type of experience.  If ya want to groove, then pick this up!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|i bought this CD 6 months ago and i STILL listen to the whole thing at least once a day. not to mention the incredible deal you get, (2 discs for the price of one,) but all the amazing talent here.....candy for your ears :)
0451163532|5.0|On Wings of Eagles by Ken Follett is a remarkable book that can truly be classified as a human-interest story.  Based on a true story, the book takes place in Iran during the Iranian Revolution of 1979 when two employees from the company EDS, Paul and Bill, are arrested for no apparent reason, their bail set impossibly high at 13 million dollars.  The only way to get them out was to set up a rescue operation and escape unnoticed over the border.  This book was definitely an edge-of-your-seat thriller that will captivate the reader and keep them turning the pages until they finish.Readers gain invaluable life lessons about friendship and heroism as the rescue team risks their lives for the sake of two people, as well as teaching people to be daring and never give up as the rescue team faces incalculable odds.I would recommend this book to anybody who is searching for excellent action packed reading material.  Ken Follett had an \\"eagle's eye\\" for an interesting story and turned it into a great piece of literature.
B000001Y42|5.0|Ok, I understand that alot of people hate \\"popular\\" music. Expcially when its a rock band. But you can NOT dis on this album. It has ground breaking lyrics and music. If you look back on this album you look back on it as one of the best if not the best Bizkit album to date. With songs like \\"counterfit\\" and \\"stuck\\" you gotta hand to it to Limp Bizkit. This is a totally rocking album. Sure alot of you have been saying Bizkit is a sell out ect. ect. but just listen to this album its got to be the best. Yeah I agree \\"significant other\\" and \\"chocolate star fish\\" are to very simular sounding albums. But this album was differnt. It was underground for a looooooooong time way before Mtv ever played \\"faith\\". If your going to rate this album on your hatred for Bizkit you should'nt rate it. Rate it on the music on the lyrics and on something that was new at the time. And looking back on it it is the best album bizkit has. Unless you look at \\"results may very\\" that shows that they are finaly progressing in their music and i'm sure their new album they are working on now will be even better. Fred i think has relized that \\"significant other\\" and \\"chocolate star fish\\" where mistakes and now i'm confident they are taking it to the next level. If you want to hear the real Limp Bizkit buy this album.
076790592X|5.0|People of ALL ages (if you can read fluenty) sohuld read this book because it has a great lesson in it. I am 13 and i believe that everyone should read \\"Tuesadays With Morrie.\\"
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I got the cassette for this one years ago from a friend (I don't even remember which one now), my second Rush album overall, and ended up really enjoying it start to finish. Unfortunately, I lost the tape when I left home and didn't replace it with a CD until recently. I was a bit hesitant, wondering if it would be as good as I remembered. I'm pleased to report that, after listening to it again many times, I still like it a lot; I may even consider it as one of my favorites thus far. The songwriting throughout is outstanding, displaying intelligence, wit, skill, and flexibility. There is definitely some groove on several of the songs - Chain Lightning, Scars, Superconductor, i.e. - providing ample hooks to interest the listener. There is quite a bit less metrical fluidity than on earlier albums, part of the trend towards simpler song structures (only Superconductor significantly strays from common time), but that only matters if you like that sort of thing, and the quality of the other elements of the performances easily makes up for this possible \\"deficiency.\\" A number of lovely melodies enhance Mr. Peart's lyrics - The Pass, Presto, Anagram, Available Light - and Mr. Lee's vocal performance is as good as it ever was or has been. Anagram (For Mongo) features lyrics that lead me to think that Mr. Peart, like John Lennon, sometimes writes lyrics simply for his own amusement, either as a word puzzle or to befuddle those who try to interpret lyrics too deeply. In this case, certainly the first and probably both are true. I don't really care to try and over-analyze lyrics myself - I like the music first and foremost. I'm usually content with a general feeling for the lyrical content. There are those who love to listen to Rush while studying the lyric sheet. These folks should find good fodder here in such songs as Chain Lightning, The Pass, Presto, and Hand Over Fist. <br />The general orchestration of the album is probably its greatest contribution to my subsequent understanding of Rush. Instead of limiting themselves to the standard trio they could have been, the band has generally felt free to expand their instrumental sound. Keyboards, including synths and piano, are tastefully used in almost every song. Acoustic guitars are also brought into play, especially Presto and Hand Over Fist. Mr. Peart uses the full range of his percussion arsenal. The result of all this is 11 highly individual songs, each a little gem in its own right. The album is not at all a tedious listen. <br />It is my belief, based on my own experience, that this album is one that would be a good place to start for someone exploring Rush anew. Aside from its overall quality and variety, the place it holds between two different so-called Rush-eras may be instructive for further investigations. Proceed to nineties or seventies albums if you want more guitar based rock, or look to the eighties albums for a more varied approach.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I was disapointed \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" was better \\"Guess Whos Back?\\" (2002) was better it just sounds all the same with a few good songs.   a baltimore love thing is good and gat man and robbin is good the rest of it blends together it dose not sound like anything on games ems or any other g unit album or the 2050 before the massacre mixtape.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The first rule of fight club is \\"you do not talk about fight club\\",  but i'm gonna risk both this and the second rule of fight club: \\"you do not talk about fight club\\". David Fincher is a funny guy. <br /> <br />FC is about an insomiac (Edward Norton in fine form). he has a crap job which involves daily menial tasks. but he is clever/cynical - you decide. He takes a bunch of pills to sleep but they dont work, then he finds the answer... <br /> <br />He attends help groups and by crying/letting others cry he can finally sleep. then <br /> <br />he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carta). She attends help groups (a 'tourist') including one for testicular cancer (dont ask). After meeting her he cant sleep. <br /> <br />Then he mets Tyler (Brad Pitt). Tyler Durden. Then his apartment is blown up and moves in with Tyler. Him and Tyler start Fight Club.  It goes national. Marla and Tyler have rocky relationship that falls apart, but thats a sideline to the main story. <br /> <br />The Edward Norton character becomes suspicious of Tyler and finds out the real reason..and target... for Fight Club. cue plot twist and jump back to the first scene of the film. <br /> <br />This film has everything from topless totty (HBC), to fights, to explosions reminiscent of McVey. Oh, it has a killer plot as well that twist every time you think you get it right up till the final not-quite-climactic scene. and it explains that you can make dynamite from soap and sell rich people's fat back to them. <br /> <br />Laced with irony, wit, and sharp dialogue this is David Fincher's Pulp Fiction. something for everyone. it is a must see film.
B0007O38F8|3.0|After reading the other reviews I was convinced \\"The Massacare\\" was garbage. Someone told me it wasn't that bad & gave me their CD to listen to. I have to admit I was suprised. Its no where near his first abulm, but it's not as bad as these reviews make it sound. If you're a 50 fan then you won't be disapointed. Out of the 22 tracks on the CD 12 are definatley songs that are hot ( lyrics + beats = hot track.  The other 9 (excluding the intro)are just ok, I've been listening to my favorite 12 tracks over & over. So, I would recommend that you listen to if for yourself & make your own decision. Because if I didn't hear it for myself I would've let the bad reviews cause me to miss out.  <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is the most experimental music I have heard in a long time. It would be cool if they were as big as led zeppelin was in the 70s. People keep saying it is too hard to listen to, and it is a little hard but it is genius and a great CD. I thought Interpol might be one of the best young bands out there, but M/V put that thought away. Greatest guitar work since Jimmy Page of Zeppelin, and the solos are a lot like Page's. Weakest song on there is The Widow, best is the hidden track Frances the Mute, or Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus. This is a genius great album.
B00067189O|1.0|I know it is a classic and I love miles but he has such better work and this album is way over rated. Don't get me wrong I love Miles and respect his work.
B00004TWZF|5.0|A toda la gente que no entienda, que lastima, soy mexicano y se friegan. Es la pelicula mas chingona que hay. <br /> <br />   BIGGEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME
B0007O38F8|5.0|To start with the album aint wat i expected! I was expecting the same ol' Dr. Dre & Eminem beats, this album however is more diverse. I admit 50's 1st album was good but there was no passion 2 wat he was sayin i.e \\"I Got Shot in da face.\\" On GRODT 50 cent was rappin about bout wat Dre and Em wanted him 2 say (To please the public/To sell records).  <br /> <br />On this album 50 has much more creative freedom (lyrically and choice of beats), he is sayin wat HE wants 2 say, remember 50's got nothing to proove 2 no1. HE DONT NEED 2 SELL RECORDS ANYMORE. This album is for tru 50 fans! It aint for people who just bought the album cuz of the hype generated from his 1st album (U will be disappointed).  <br /> <br />'Candy Shop', like 'In da club' was released to draw in the mainstream crowd (Dr. Dre Production) So when i heard that joint i was expecting the whole album to be full of the same mainstream-crowd-pleasing material. <br /> <br />Lets just say i was pleasantly suprised.
B0007O38F8|5.0|This is a badass album i dunno what kinna gay rap shi* these losers bashing this album are used too. News flash ladies Nsync and BSB isnt rap. If you want a badass album get this, if you want some gay wanna be rap be the losers you girls are and get some Jay Z shi*<br /><br />GET IT
B00006JIA4|5.0|This is a superb compilation. Even if you have all the best ofs, by QUEEN, the Booklet is a nice addition. <br />The remasters are not as good as what Brian May, and Roger Taylor did with other material ( The Crown Jewels), but it is mostly a good collection. Disc 3 is the exception in format; for one, they should never have included Elton John's Awful damage to a great song. And if you have ever read any of the Bios of Freddy, you will know that Freddy was a fan of Montserrat Cabelle, and the song he did with her shows just how well they worked  together. And a selection of Freddy's solo material is a nice afterthought. The material from MADE IN HEAVEN is a good thought, and shows just how poignant the album it comes from is as a work. It is, as was noted by QUEEN, very touching, and appropriate, that the last videotaped material that Freddy did was the line \\"I Still Love You\\". <br />As an introduction, the collection is great. <br />If you enjoy it, I can highly recommend, THE CROWN JEWELS, and if you want a Great Version of the Album, get the THX  edit of  A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. <br />If this collection is the start of your journey as a Queen fan, then I hope you buy some of the superb material that is out there, especially the Newly  done concert DVDs, and other material. QUEEN is not just another over the top band... it has produced some of the most enduring Popular music in the English Speaking world, and in it's tour time, showed it was a master of stadium rock anthems, and the use of QUEEN songs in many venues, shows just how culturally significant their work still is to the world.
1594200106|1.0|Reading this is a bit like biting into a gigantic cream-puff. One that somehow manages to be both undeniably stale and unreliably sweet. There it sits uneasily.  You paid for it. Now you've got to eat it. Or do you?  500 plus pages of derivative drek. With all the luminous reviews one can only conclude that people no longer know what they are reading or why they are bothering. And those comparisons...oh my Lord.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Or words to that effect; I think it was Woody Allen  who said that. and Forrest Gump embodies the \\"Just turn up\\" principle; that is pretty much the only \\"point\\" to this film. <br />There does not seem to be any statement in this film that Forrest has a purpose. He just follows his nose, and things happen. Maybe if more people did this, they might enjoy what they have in life, and get more out of the precious moments we have in life. <br /> <br />Without a doubt, this film is superbly entertaining. If you have a good script, and a Great cast, then all you need is a Zemeckis to create visually good material, and masterful special  effects  to back it all up. <br />The end result is that a very moving, dramatic, funny, and ultimately emotional film will result. <br /> <br />if you find something deep and meaningful in this film, then good for you, and if you find something else in this film, I would question why you would watch a film; at its heart, this film is superbly crafted. It cannot but be with the people who created this work. <br />The imposed meanings that some reviewers assert tell more about the reviewers than they do about the film. <br /> <br />Highly recommended as great entertainment.
B0007O38F8|5.0|People are just J.O.S.E. .  This album kicks ass!  I have two copies.  I do not agree with all his beef, but the album is worth buying.  Peace.
B00000BKI4|3.0|This is the band's fourth effort. Mercury Rev, at least on this CD reportedly changed from noisy psychedelia over to dream pop with more (how do I put it?) showy arrangements. In this case, it isn't all that bad of a choice. Tracks I thought were better are \\"Tonite It Shows\\", \\"Holes\\", \\"The Funny Bird\\" and \\"Endlessly\\". Also sort of liked the straight-laced \\"Goddess On A Highway\\". If you're in the mood for some new/er music that you might've not gotten to hear yet, this CD is a decent find.
0141301155|3.0|the screenplay to the 1917 movie is so much better the songs and the changes from the original are inspired breathing life into the book
B0000017CA|3.0|Review no. 62. I remember catching Acid Bath playing a dive awhile back. You really have to hand it to a band that would dare to use artwork for their CD cover that was ~actual~ done by the notorious serial killer John Wayne Gacy (R.I.P.). Acid Bath's music is decently penned hardcore / sludge metal - at least that's what I was getting from 'Kite String Pops'. The CD does grow on you, with the better tracks being \\"Dope Fiend\\", \\"What Color Is Death\\", the rocking \\"Cheap Vodka\\" and \\"Tranquilized\\". Line-up: Dax Riggs - vocals, Mike Sanchez & Sammy Duet - guitars, Audie Pitre - bass and Jimmy Kyle - drums. Just might appeal to some fans of Gravity Kills, Rosetta Stone, Crowbar, Down and Soilent Green.
B000669GAI|3.0|I hadn't heard anything by Pearl Jam, so I thought the two-disc set would be a good way to get into their music. Unfortunately I started listening and was left thinking, \\"What's the big deal?\\" <br /> <br />I do like a few tracks, but a majority of them sound identical to each other. The vocals are of the dry sort grunge is known for, the problem here being that the vocals in each song could be replaced with those in other songs and you wouldn't know the difference. Many of the songs are \\"sung\\" in a muffled, mumbling sort of way. I had a hard time understanding the lyrics - the fact that the CD booklet doesn't include them (as no Greatest Hits seem to) wasn't much help. <br /> <br />On top of that, because the songs all sound the same, I had a hard time separating them all due to the CD itself. E.g. on the back cover they list all the songs, but they're \\"cleverly\\" done in a scrambled way so that the only words you can read are \\"Jeremy\\" and a few others. So if you want to know the tracklist, you have to open the CD, get out the booklet (which is kept tucked inside rather tightly), look in the front, etc. - just to see which track is playing. <br /> <br />So I didn't like the music very much and the packaging was a disappointment. Superunknown by Soungarden is still my favorite grunge album, Pearl Jam just doesn't interest or impress me very much. <br /> <br />Plus, I really don't like grunge, so that might have something to do with it.
B000068R1X|5.0|Bark at the moon was a hard-rocking album.Jake e.lee had to replace a talented guitarist in Randy Rhoads.Ozzy really could have done a better job with the vocals,but it is still classic ozzy! Jake e.lee is a talented guitarist and he was a great addition for ozzy's band.If you are a musician or guitar player,I would get this album.Don't listen Dauglas Rausch,a.k.a piano wizard.He doesn't know what talking about.I also recommend The Ultimate Sin album.
B0006FFRW0|4.0|Fans will love this, it's got the videos, re-mixed music (in stereo and Dolby surround), etc. Although I must say the \\"Closer\\" video is really disturbing. I never want to watch it ever again. It freaked me out.
B000066I6N|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite Robert Plant releases. Sure I know its a cover album, but if that is bothering some people, they have to put it aside and grab this release. I have had this record since it first came out, and always seem to be coming back to it. What is amazing about it, is the restlesness of the songs. Very cutting edge psychadelics going on here. Seems like this record could have come out in the 1965-68 time period. Roberts voice is nowhere near the range he once had with Zep, but the songs match his strength on this record. I hope this is a continuing trend for him. Putting out discs that constantly challenge his audience ala Neil Young. And his band is top notch also.
B0007P3582|1.0|Rap/Hip-hop has taken the wrong turn thanks to peeps like 50 cent.  He makes people like me who actually cherish good music almost despise rap.  50 Cent raps about the same stuff, he has no game he barely even switches up his raps and if he does, he doesn't sound original or even good.  His voice has lil character, nothing like Jay-Z who has a million an 1 different types of flows.  Even Eminem has more lyrical character then 50 Cent.  50 Cent is never gonna be embraced the way that he once was.  I'm so glad people are over that finally.  I used to be a hardcore fan of his at that.  I loved the first CD, but since this is his sophmore CD shouldn't it be better then the first?
B0006ZE7G2|1.0|Pink Floyd is my second favorite band after Led Zeppelin. I got into rock music because of them. still, with all my love for PF, this is the worst movie I have seen in my life. Waters was either smoking crack, or he wanted to make some extra money, I dont know. How could this calm psychedelic band that created Meddle, Wish You Were Here and other masterpieces, make such a brutal, nasty and disturbing movie? If it was slipknot or mudwayne, I would not be surprised, but why PF?This was a huge disappointment and I got rid of it the next day. The soundtrack album is very good, though. If you want a PF video, buy Live At Pompeii, don't buy this crap!
B00008EY9G|5.0|I watched this movie one night really liked it,is like the old kind of movies back in late 70s and 80s..Really nice scrip and acting. Really enjoy it,and glad I bought the DVD..Don't miss it is a good thriller ride ,and great ending.!
B0002858YS|3.0|Las Vegas is a perfect fake place to be from, for fake \\"new\\" music to fill our retro-obsessed heads. Being a songwriter, I have an ear for melody and when it's not new. I like the sound of this band a lot, but I liked it also back at CBGB's in 1979 when I first heard it...  \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is the worst rip-off, the verse is almost an exact, word for word, copy of Bowie's \\"Queen B...h\\" from the album \\"Hunky Dory\\" and the whole chorus is Blondies' \\"Dreaming\\" - Sing along if you wish... \\"Dreaming is free...\\" Right?  So they even copied the \\"new wave\\" drums and guitars, how un-clever of them.  Do musicians think thay can do this, if it's just for \\"kids\\" who don't know any better?  A few vocal variations in a direct copy, don't hide the glaring truth.  Well, I noticed and others did too... Try learning melodic invention, it is possible.
B0007O38F8|5.0|k i gatta keep this short cause i gatta go soon but this album is great...not as good as his first but still good.  and y would i listen to someone's review that says bunk instead of junk....lol i just got to laugh people say this is bad...lol
B0000027F8|5.0|I bought this album on its release day back in 1990, I took it home and was a little disappointed, I wanted FAITH II, However, it didnt take me long to realize that this album is in fact 100% better musicaly, lyricaly and vocaly than FAITH. <br />George never ceases to impress me, I cant think of another artist with a voice so PURE, he can easily wipe the floor with other vocalist who are supposed to be his contemporaries. <br />\\"Praying For Time\\" for me is a song like no other you will ever here, somehow the lyrics just FIT,it is honest and downright beautiful.The rest of the album is just as good with the exception of Soul Free which although is good by anyone elses standards it isnt his strongest track by any means.His cover of Stevie Wonders \\"They Wont Go When I Go\\" still makes the hairs on my neck stand up and we are talking 15 years later here,and just to point out, if you check on the CD he actually recorded the song LIVE, no retakes or studio trickery here just pure smooth haunting vocals. <br />\\"Mothers Pride\\" couldnt BE any better, if any song HAD to be written about the perils of war and the loss a mother has to go through THIS IS THE ONE. \\"TIME WILL COME/WHEN HE HOLDS GUN/TIL KINGDOM COME\\" <br />Musicaly LWP is so hard to pin down, he covers all bases with ease, \\"Cowboys And Angels\\" is another winner, I absolutely love the Saxophone break at the end of this track it is such a beautiful peice of music,and the standard just carries on right to the end of the disc. <br />If you are thinking about buying this album, maybe you heard \\"Faith\\" and liked it or \\"Older\\" but havent heard this album and you are trying to make your mind up dont waste any more time thinking, THIS ALBUM IS A MUST,wether you like George Michael or not there is no getting away from the fact that there isnt a singer alive today that can match him vocally, You wont be disappointed TRUST ME!!! <br />Go ahead....LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE

0441009425|4.0|Plot Summary: For the first couple hundred pages there are three separate storylines: The crew of the starship Nostalgia for Infinity is searching for Dan Sylveste, a scientist and his A.I. father to help them cure their captain who is suffering from some sort of virus that the Sylvestes had earlier helped them with. On Yellowstone, in Chasm city, a Shadowplay assassin is drawn into something bigger. On Resurgam Sylveste is investigating an extinct race of aliens, the Amarantin, amidst several coups of the government there. By the halfway point of the book, the Infinity has stopped at Yellowstone to look for Sylveste but recruited the Assassin, Khouri, to be their new gunner then went on to Resurgam to get Sylveste. However not everything is as it seems. There is a secret that will be discovered about the extinction of the Amarantins that will tie into an even more ancient war which could have repercussions for the human race in the future. <br /> <br />Opinion: Very good opening novel. I love the way the plots start out separate then weave together by mid-book. Unfortunately once they combine, there is just one storyline from several different perspectives. Not much variety. Luckily, enough is going on that this does not hinder the novel too much, more just a personal preference towards diverse plot elements going deeper into the book. The characters start out pretty distinct but by the end of the book they all run together. For the last hundred pages the three main female characters could have easily been any of the others, I felt. None are really likeable as a person, they all have flaws, but that adds to the grittiness of the story. This is not a \\"likeable\\" type of story. I guess you could say that rather than pulling for any of the actual characters, I was rooting for \\"the facts\\" to win out. Certain revelations and truths are dropped early on then are basically ignored for long periods of time. One begins to wonder if something was missed. On the other hand, near the end of the book, all the characters are making their own revelations about whose deceptions and stories are true and whose are not. By the end, everything is eventually explained into place even if some great leaps of logic are required for certain characters. The ending sets up conflicts that I am sure will be explored in the sequels. This story is very large in scope and the timescale is immense. <br /> <br />Recommendation: I would give this 3.5 out of 5 stars due to the excellent story but some of the things I mentioned above seemed to hinder my full enjoyment of it. I will definitely read the sequels. Anyone who enjoyed The Golden Age trilogy by John C. Wright would do well to pick this up. It's the beginning of a grand epic.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I'm tired of it man, just plain tired. 50 Cent is talentless, he lacks the ability to flow, speak clearly & rhyme like the greats in the industry. His music is catchy, his hooks are catchy and that is the only reason that his albums do well. Lyrically he is one of the worst rappers in the game. Strip away the hot beat for \\"Candy Shop\\" and tell me what exactly is he saying, nothing. The beat is what prepelled the single to be as big as it was, and with a chorus, so simple that a 10 year old could have written it, it gets caught in your head. If I were 50, I would be embarrased to release these albums. How do you call yourself a man of the streets, a gangster, a thug when you are putting out the records you release. The facade, the image, and the pure horrible music have got to go. It's people like 50 Cent that bring unwanted, negative press to the industry. He is a media whore a la Britney Spears, only \\"in making himself look good\\", he is damaging a culture's reputation; one that true artists with great skill and determination built up. All their hard work is being destroyed and the once positivity & fun behind hip hop is gone.<br /><br />Sure 50 Cent isn't the only person that is responsible for it, but he is a great deal of it. Chris Rock put it best at the MTV Video Music Awards \\"I haven't heard anything good about the record, no reviews, nothing that would make me want to buy it at all; all you ever hear is HE GOT SHOT 9 TIMES\\". His debut album was decent, I'm not going to deny it, he brought it a lot harder than he did hear. I would be mortified to release this album, especially considering that Young Buck & Game (who is no longer a member of G-Unit) have released solo albums that are 10 times better than 50's, and they are supposed to be his protogees.<br /><br />First, do you honestly mean to tell me that you couldn't find anything better than \\"Candy Shop\\" to release as a single? Turns out that has miserable as that song is, its probably one of the album's better moments (due heavily to a fantastic beat & a guest appearence by promising RnB diva Olivia). \\"In my Hood\\" is laughable, but possibly the album's most comdeic moment comes in the form of \\"Piggy Bank\\". Besides a horific chorus, 50 disses & announces HE BELIEVES TO BE BETTER AT RAPPING than Fat Joe, Shyne, Jadakiss & Nas, the latter two are artists are questionably two of the best of all time. Is he kidding? He even goes after Lil Kim, who lets be honest, even though she is a female, lyrically she would tear him to shreds.<br /><br />\\"Everybody's listening, c'mon everybody's listening man\\" he boasts on \\"Piggy Bank\\", but I can guarantee that's not the case. An obligatory guest appearence by hip hop's former golden-boy turned has been Eminem on \\"Gatman & Robin\\" & Academy award winning actor turned singer Jamie Foxx on \\"Build You Up\\" still couldn't boost enough interest, so 50 had to stage a publicitiy stunt, this time being getting shots fired at him leaving Hot 97 radio station in NY. You can't be serious. It seems him and fellow exhibitionist Paris Hilton have the best luck when it comes time to increase media coverage when a project is ready to come out. Please, my guess is the whole thing was staged, hell it was the shots fired at him that made the people buy the first record. It's a shame that thats what it has come to.<br /><br />I can go on forever about how bad the record is and what a waste 50 is, but why bother, his music and actions speak for themselves. I couldn't imagine seeing him around for much longer.better moments (due heavily to a fantastic beat & a guest appearence by promising RnB diva Olivia). \\"In my Hood\\" is laughable, but possibly the album's most comdeic moment comes in the form of \\"Piggy Bank\\".

B0006SSOHC|3.0|Two men awaken to find themselves chained to thick metal piping at the opposite ends of an old abandoned bathroom. Adam (Leigh Whannell) is a photographer; Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, The Princess Bride) is a surgeon. Both men have no idea how they ended up in this room together. Nor how a dead body laying between them got there. In the dead body's hands are a gun and a micro-cassette tape player.<br /><br />They soon discover a micro-cassette tape in each of their pockets, and quickly uncover a creepy message that awaits them by their captor. The \\"jigsaw\\" killer has caught them: a psychopath who doesn't necessarily \\"kill\\" people, but helps them kill themselves . . . or survive by killing others.<br /><br />**********************************************************************<br /><br />The psychology surrounding the events is sound enough: the slow descent into suspicion of each other, the lack of external stimulation that leads to a decline in mental faculties, and the eventual near insanity that would insue if you found out you had to kill someone in order to save yourself and/or your loved ones. Do they deserve to die anymore than you do?<br /><br />Where this film fell a bit short was in acting and plot. The acting was subpar. Cary Elwes, who I absolutely LOVED in The Princess Bride, here comes off like an amateur (could be that they were pressed for time and money, filming on a budget of $1.2 million and in 18 days). Makenzie Vega, Elwes' wife in the film, was flat, uncharming, and a bore. As were the estimable Danny Glover (Grand Canyon), and Ken Leung (Rush Hour and Red Dragon).<br /><br />There were also enough plot holes to make this film resemble swiss cheese. There was the fact that the main antagonist turns out to be someone who could NEVER have pulled off such cases (mainly because he was deathly ill); Dr. Gordon was allowed to sit and watch the interrogation of a survivor of the Jigsaw Murderer (which NEVER would have happened if, as the film shows us, Dr. Gordon was an initial suspect); the \\"game\\" that is played out by this killer is given to the captives bit by bit, as if it were a simple video game and all you had to do to survive was to put the pieces together. But, what I didn't understand, is that if this psycho enjoyed watching people tear themselves or others apart, why would he give them a way out, with simple clues and instructions? Didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />For the horror fan, though, I'm sure this film will be coveted and hailed as a great film of 2004. For me, though, it's a pretty big disappointment.s the film shows us, Dr. Gordon was an initial suspect); the \\"game\\" that is played out by this killer is given to the captives bit by bit, as if it were a simple video game and all you had to do to survive was to put the pieces together.

B0007O38F8|4.0|SHUT UP!!! Stop dissen the album just cuz he goes after Nas, Jada, and Fat Joe. The album is not the greatest but it is still a pretty decent album. Stop judging it cuz he starts sh*t with other rappers. And stop crying that the game is gone. Dont worry you guys, life isn't over cuz game got the boot. The cd is good. And for people to say he doesnt have the right to go at nas,jada and joe, your kidding yourself. You guys are sitting there saying he sucks but last time i checked he single handely destroyed Murder Inc. He has the right to go after whoever he wants. So stop complaining. Its a good cd. Go get is you havnt already
0385513755|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book.  I thought the plot was wonderful, I cared about the characters & best of all I learned about things I never knew.<br /><br />Mostly I'm writing this to let others know that if you are going to buy this book, you might as well get this illustrated edition.  Because through out reading, I constantly had to get online and look up art & locations in France, etc.  This book will make it so much easier to really get in deep with what he's saying & not have to take the breaks to do your own image research.
0440237688|4.0|I have read this book many times in my schooling career and I believe it holds a great message that should be read by everyone.  Unfortunatly i think the book was written for a younger crowd and there are other books out there that better exemplify the plot and meaning of the story.  I would highly recommend this for an early reader around the eight grade.
B0002YLC24|5.0|There was alot of hype leading up to the release of this film, and with good reason. The original movie, &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; has achieved the status of being a cult favorite among movie goers, and many were leary about what would take place in a sequel. So many questions were left unanswered with the first flim: would Jesse and Celine ever meet up six months later in Vienna? Would they be able to move on with their lives after their one incredible evening together? Many people, myself inculded, were somewhat afraid to find out these answers, instead preferring to let our imagination run away with us. <br />But I give major credit to Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who all three cowrote this movie. They know what works, and they knew how to answer all the questions that were important to the fans, and I have to admit that I would not change one thing about this film. <br />This one is now set in Paris, nine years after the initial meeting in Vienna. Jesse is now on a book tour, a book which is of course about his night with Celine. She meets him in a Paris bookstore, where he is being interviewed, and they embark on a real time one and a half hour catch up session before he must go to the airport and back to America.  Their dialogue with one another is as though they never left each other, which in a way is very satisfying to see. The conversation relates to things they have talked about before, venturing into the philosophical issues of life, and the half written, half improvised script is very realistic, and very satisfying. <br />As much as I want to, I will not spill the secrets of this film, as they must be seen to be fully understood. What &quot;Before Sunset&quot; is is a brilliantly romantic movie about holding on to one's past, trying to keep heading for the future, and wondering what could have been. Everything here is perfect, and this needs to be considered one of the best movies of the year, without question. It is simple, quick and it gets to all the things we have wanted to know about for the last nine years. I also found that this movie had a very good ending, revealing just enough and leaving enough to the imagination to appease all viewers. This truly is a great film. For those fans of &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;, this is an absolute must see, and Jesse and Celine should be considered some of the great romantic characters of all time.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan since the early days of TNG (when I was little I often watched reruns of TOS though) and Star Trek: Enterprise truly has become my favourite.  The actors are very well cast, and despite some of them (Travis, Hoshi for example) deserving more use in the show, they really bring the Star Trek message across.  The stories have developped, especially season 4 - you'll see - will be very exciting!  I wish UPN/Paramount/Viacom hadn't cancelled this show, it's high quality TV and thousands of Trek fans worldwide want to save Enterprise together, because Enterprise deserves more than anything else to remain on the air (or should I say in space?!).  So thumbs up to this first season - it's wonderful!!! 'Shuttlepod One', 'Aquisition' and 'Two Days and Two Nights' are my favourite episodes of this season. You'll love them!!
B0007O38F8|1.0|Wow..what a disapointment! This can't even hold a candle to the \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" offering. The lyrical content is filled with trite bragadocious narcissitic lines. The beats are 3rd rate at best, they sound like they were made on an 8 track mixer in someone's basement. The hooks are redundant, and unoriginal. The production value is, well..cheap..there's no groove to this CD. And I'm somewhat turned off by 50's blatant disrespect for everyone else in the rap game. I suspect the bridges he's burning now will come back to haunt him in the future when it's time to ante up and put out an album that's near the caliber of \\"Get Rich or die trying\\" <br /> <br />I think 50 may have shot his load. I hope he's got some money saved up, because this album ain't gonna bring in the money that he's gonna need to make those payments on Mike Tyson's mansion.  <br /> <br />It sucks becuase I was really looking foward to his next creative project. <br /> <br />Save your money. <br /> <br />Download it from a file sharer! <br /> <br />It might be time for 50 to go back to selling crack.
B0002X314C|4.0|After reading a review in Entertaiment Weekly in which this CD was rated an A- and John Legends voice compared to Smokie Robinson and Marvyn Gaye.  I couln't wait to buy this CD.  Although I don't think he is as soulful as Marvyn Gay or as distinctive Smokie Robinson.<br /><br />Overall its an enjoyable CD and well worth the money.<br />I enjoyed these tracks the best:<br /><br />Let's Get it On<br />Stay with You<br />so high<br />Refuse<br />It Don't Have to Change<br /><br />It's the kind of CD that I can listen to without reaching for the remote to skip tracks. Which is why I rated it 4 stars.

0380733358|5.0|This book provides believable suspense of a German spy working in England during World War II. The book has plenty of suspense, historical relevance, a love story, and action all wrapped up in one not-too-long book. It is a great read. It is the book that turned me on to writing talents of Ken Follett.
0375422307|5.0|For some of us it is hard enough to deal with our growing pains and make sense of the world during our childhood, but things get even tougher when political crisis has swept the nation. <br /> <br />This book is full of expression of emotion, in every page and illustration, and it is all beautifully done.  <br />By the time you've read it, you feel as if you have watched a good short movie! <br />
0316172324|5.0|This book is about the power of quick, almost instantaneous, decisions that some people make with excellent results. It is about the value of intuition. Our subconscious mind can integrate small, even subtle, clues to very quickly make great decisions. Of course, not everyone can do this. This book, in part, is about who has this power, how valuable is it, and what can be done to acquire this power. The second part of the book is about how we often get these quick decisions wrong.
B0007O38F8|1.0|TERRIBLE... 50 is the worst rapper to date.... 50 thinks he is the greatest thing since g strings and tries to start unnessecary battles that we dont need anymore....just to let you know JADAKISS will kill 50 in a battle... HANDSDOWN!!!! <br /> <br />50 IS trying sooo friggin hard to be ja rule it does not make sense....and who does he think he is for runnin THE GAME out of g unit...   <br /> <br />basically in a nutshell... 50 is diggin his own grave he thinks he is invisible now... just wait his downfall is not too far in the future....
B0007O38F8|4.0|I understand that this album isnt quiet on the same level as \\"Get rich or die tryin\\" but damn!!! Everyone is murdering this album.  I can give credit where is is due, so thats what I will do.  First off, everyone has heard his first 2 singles.... Disco Inferno and Candy Shop.... both good tracks.  The album starts off good with \\"In my Hood\\" and \\"This is 50\\" and the next track \\"Im supposed to Die Tonight\\" is okay.  <br /> <br />The track that is getting most of the hype \\"Piggybank\\", becuase of it dissing Fat Joe, Kiss, and Nas; was a pretty weak diss track if you ask me, but none the less he said what he said and I think he made a big mistake..... this may be one reason why his fans are upset; because I like all 3 of those rappers and it also cost him a good artist in The Game. -- Dont think it was worth it 50!!! <br /> <br />Some more good tracks are \\"Outta Control\\", \\"Ski Mask Way\\", and \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\"---this track is one of my favorites because of the story telling... track about a relationship to drugs... good move 50.  \\"Ryder Music\\" is an okay track nuthin special.... \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" is hot to me, but some folks dont seem to be feeling it. <br /> <br />The production on this album was pretty diverse... he had a lot of different producers and that is one thing that I liked about this album.  This is a solid release from 50 but not his best... its not a great album but at the same time its not as bad as everyone is making it out to be.  I would think that fans of 50 would be pleased.... you cant expect the same thing on every album (just becuase this album was a little different doesnt make it bad).   <br /> <br />Some other good songs were \\"My Toy Soldier\\" - one of my favs, \\"Position of Power\\", \\"I dont need Em\\" and \\"Hate It or Love It\\" remix feat all of G-Unit (even The GAme) <br /> <br />I could go on all day and explain each track but I honestly think that fans of 50 need to put the thoughts of this new beef to the side... and listen to this album without any biased thoughts. <br /> <br />ONE THING THAT I REALLY THINK NEEDS TO BE SAID.... EVERYONES HEARD ABOUT THE BEEF BETWEEN THE GAME AND 50 AND ITS SAD BECAUSE I COULD SEE A TON OF GREAT ALBUMS WITH THOSE 2... BUT WE CANT AFFORD TO LOSE MORE ARTISTS....WE AS FANS SHOULD REALLY POST OUR OPINIONS IN ANYWAY POSSIBLE TO STOP THIS AND 2 KEEP THE BEEF IN THE MUSIC NOT IN THE STREETS... MUCH LOVE TO 50 AND GAME....CALM DOWN FELLAS!!!! <br /> <br />FANS OF 50.... buy this and be your own judge
0804115613|3.0|I ususally enjoy the book more than the movie , but when it comes to Fried Green Tomatoes I definiely enjoyed the movie more. I saw the movie about 12 years ago and instantly fell in love with it. I  think Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates are some of the most talented actresses ever. In the movie you get the impression that Ruth and Iggie are just great female friends, almost sisters.  In the book, it sound like they are homosexual lovers, or atleast that is what Iggie seems to want.  I was sad to see that once I read the book a year ago.  However, it was definitely an interesting and sometimes downright hilarious book.  You definitely get to know the characters better from reading the book. It made me want to take a trip down to Alabama. I think kids over 15 would enjoy it.
0671027344|4.0|I picked this book up one night and didn't go to bed until I'd finished it, it was just too hard to set aside.  An easy, fast read that nonetheless contains page after page of writing that's stuck with me long after finishing it.  As others have said, the main character Charlie speaks openly and honestly - often painfully so; his voice is a sweetly odd combination of naivety and blunt insightfulness that rings remarkably true.  Oftentimes he'd hit upon episodes or comments that took me immediately back to my own high school years, leaving me with a sweet sense of nostalgia despite - or maybe in part because of - some of the darker happenings he encountered.  The only part of the book I had any problem with occurs very near the end, there's a \\"revelation\\" that comes out that felt rather unnecessary in that it seems to try to \\"explain\\" things that to me didn't really need any explanation; even that revelation, however, works on some level and while not the most successful part of the story for me, neither did it take away from my overall enjoyment.  A great book overall and one well worth reading!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is the best album i've heard since...their last album.  Bout time a band broke the mold and started making music on an epic scale. 5 stars for this wonderful achievment of musical ability.
B00019GG1M|5.0|This Edition comes with a Bonus track of My Imortal in a slightly different edition.  This version of My Imortal starts up much faster and the flow of the notes is already consistant not somewhat skewed like the original.  There are many other mild newances to this version of the track it is definantly good.  I bought the Argentina Version which is the same as this.  It's a wonderful album.  I hear this version of this track may be avaiable on a single as well.  I'll have to see.  Enjoy.
B0006213WG|1.0|as with most major label pop-punk acts (like blink 182 and good charlotte), sum 41 started out producing power-chord pop songs with intoxicating chorus' and catchy lyrics. All killer, no filler was one of the greatest punk records to hit the early 2000's, and does this look infected? was a descent follow-up. HOWEVER, chuck is one of the worst albums I've bought in a long time. SUM 41 seems to have taken the gc route, meaning that they did away with all the punk influence of the previous albums and went straight for the sell-out experimental tactics of their peers. There is nothing catchy or memorable about chuck, and it rivals good charlottes horrid chronicals of life and death as the WORST album released in 04'. If you want some catchy, memorable pop-punk, check out the latest from yellowcard, fall out boy, bowling for soup, simple plan or lucky boys confusion instead.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|I found this film mildly gripping until the last act, and then I was sickened. Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss. There is never really any doubt (at least for the audience) of Dave Boyle's innocence of the murder of Jimmy Marcus's daughter, yet Marcus' thuggish character over-rides any such concerns. Marcus coerces a \\"confession\\" from Boyle after telling him he will let him live, and then once Marcus' pre-conceived notion is thus confirmed, he kills Boyle anyways. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) shows up just in time to tell Marcus that he has killed an innocent man, and Marcus' reaction can be summed as a \\"so what.\\"  The end of the film doesn't ask any gray moral or ethical questions--quite the contrary. Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served--the daughter was an innocent, Boyle was innocent, and they're both dead. It all \\"evens out\\" in some warped way. The pathetic Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) the only person who apparently cared if Boyle lived or died, is left unnoticed and marginalized. The last ten minutes of the film, thus, makes what transpired before filmmaking mendacity. <br />     What exactly was the message Clint Eastwood was trying to convey here? The only one that makes sense to me is  Dirty Harry-type vigilantism where colateral damage is a fact of life is acceptible under certain situations. I, frankly, find such reasoning appalling.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I was a fan of slipknot untill this release. I can't believe people can call this \\"metal\\". Only get this album if you can deal with soft rock.
B0007O38F8|2.0|This album sucked. GRODT was much hotter and did not have any skippable tracks. I am also angry at 50 for getting rid of The Game, who is a lyrically better rapper. Candy Shop is WAY overplayed and Disco Inferno is a retarded club anthem. He wants to prove he is the greatest rapper from NY, so he disses the other great NY rappers (Nas, Jadakiss, Shyne). So why not dis the fake NY MC's, such as Cam'ron, Mobb Deep or Fabolous?  The only good songs on here are God Gave Me Style, Gatman And Robbin' feat. Eminem and Outta Control. I was also hoping to get the second G-Unit album, but now that The Game is officially gone, I think I'll keep my $15 to 20 dollars.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I've been a 50 fan for a while, i have every album he ever put out and not put out (underground) and he is def. if not the one of the most talented rappers I have ever heard. Him and Tupac are my two favorite (and banks) lyrcists of all time. Anyway I kind of had a feeling this wouldn't be another GRODT from the first two singles released. First off the game is gone, S*** happens i brought the documentary and it's one of my favorite albums i always play in my car but game being booted has got absolutley nothing to do with this album so why doesn't everyone just talk bout the album? Which I feel he really slacked off on because he is trying to get his other artists/subordinates into the lime light. When I first heard it it didn't even sound like 50, and you can tell cause 50s got a really distinct voice and way of rapping which turned me off. And all the stuff about the beef, let him express himself , better he's honest than kiss the as* of the people he hates, but he could have made it a more diverse album than just talkin shi*. He's better than this and it's really dissappointing especially here in NY where rap fans hold him to a really high level and have high expectations when they hear a new 50 albums dropping. I hope he can redeem himself before all his new enemies start taking shots at this album cause with massacre he def. gave em plenty of ammo. Bottom line, I love 50 but this album is garbage, i thought i would never say that bout 50 but it has to be said and this is coming from a true fan born and raised in queens....... come on 50, turn it around man don't let people remember you for this, your better than that, you let a lot of people down man. -p
B0007O38F8|5.0|I got the album, it's tight, it shows progression, he addresses heroine, I think people were expecting Get Rich Pt. 2, he has grown as an artist and the Jamie Foxx track is mad tight.  People just hating on him, cause he about his money, the album is a classic and it takes you to a different level, you have to look at it as another chapter, not get rich2. SO ALL YOU HATERS, HATE ON, BIATCHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
0446677450|2.0|The slim pages of Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad contain a surprise: three books for the price of one!  The only problem is that none of these books is particularly good.    The first book lurking in Rich Dad, Poor Dad would have made a nice pamphlet, or about 20 powerpoint slides, describing the author's financial philosophy.  Some Kiyosaki's sound bites are on target(Americans need more financial education; working for your self is empowering; it's a good idea to acquire assets that generate positive cash flow), some are provocative (a house should be considered a liability, not an asset), and some are downright loopy (\\"pay yourself first\\", even when you don't have enough to pay your bills, so that angry creditors make you work harder).  Right or wrong, the basic ideas are all worth thinking about.    But you can't charge much for a pamphlet, so this thin layer of material is padded out to fill a second book, which strains to reach 195 pages of random transitions and endless repetition.  It's a bit like being stuck next to a talkative but slightly drunk businessman for six hours on a plane.  You don't need to worry about missing anything, because you're going to hear it again.     Just one example:    \\"In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary.  I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense.\\" (p. 59).    \\"If you want a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary.  Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average perion, it may as well be written in Mandarin.\\"  (p. 61).     Yes, folks, that's a mere two pages apart.  And it's hardly an aberration in this book.  You have to wonder what co-author Sharon Lechter and the editor of this book did for their paychecks besides press \\"play\\" on the tape recorder.    The third book contained in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the most interesting--andmost disturbing.  It's hard to tell how seriously to take the backstory behind the author's financial genius--one suspects a lot of embellishment to serve the clever title.  Still, there is an alarming genuineness to Kiyosaki's repeated trashings of his real father, whom he alternately refers to as his \\"educated dad\\" or \\"poor dad\\".  This fellow seems to have enjoyed a successful career as a teacher, government official and union leader (and supposedly acquired enough assets to be subject to the estate tax--not bad for a \\"poor\\" dad).  Nevertheless, his son views him as a pathetic failure compared to his \\"rich dad\\", the entrepreneur-speculator father of his best friend.  This vaguely drawn figure (perhaps based on a real person) gives Kiyosaki some helpful advice at a young age, but there's nothing to elevate him to \\"dad\\" status--other than Kiyosaki's all-too-real loathing of his own father.  Kiyosaki's own raging insecurities (centered on his lack of educational attainments and paternal disapproval of his career path) take center stage in this Oedipal drama.  This part of the book gave me the creeps.
B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein really have outdone themselves. The amazing thing was that this is only their second album, and one of their best. It's up there with Reise, Reise. This album has a perfect mix of electronic elements with the hard, driving riffs and forceful music that Rammsten so commonly uses. Note that I don't own this CD, but I have heard all of the songs and I will buy this as soon as I can. <br />The CD opens up with the title track-Sensucht (longing). THis is a pretty good song, introduced by a sample of a middle-eastern sounding humming, which introduces a very heavy riff and a good song. The next song, Engel (Angel), which is one of Rammstein's more popular songs, opens up with high whistling and develops into a great song. The chorus features German singer Bobo, who is used in later Rammstein albums as well. The next song is amazing. While Tier (animal/ beast) doesn't include much singing, the synth mixed in along with the light, almost punk-sounding guitar part that opens the song make this song complete. THe song opens up with the said guitar part, makes a few bangs, and introduces a very heavy riff, along with a catchy keyboard part accompanying the chorus. This is followed by the odd introduction to Bestrafe Mich (punish me). THe song is good, featuring a nice riff and some good singing, including some by the band without Till (the frontman/ vocalist). <br />The next song on this album became a major US hit, was featured in a few films such as \\"How High,\\" and was in the sountrack CD for \\"The Matrix.\\" It was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1999. This song is \\"Du Hast\\" (you have) which is a brilliant play on words, with a catchy riff, some great synth, and a very catchy chorus. It's a bit repetitive, however, so it's definitely not Rammstein's best song, just their most popular. Note that Du Hast means You Have, NOT you hate. The english version used you hate, but that's not a correct translation. You hate would be du hasst. <br />Thenext song was rather infamous. Bueck Dich (Bend over/ bend down, or as translating programs put it, Bend you) opens with some pounding and then a driving riff. The lyrics are commanding (Bend down, I command you), and there's some great synth in this song. Especially in the part where Till's voice slows and sounds like it's going haywire, when he says \\"Bueck Dich, das gesicht interessiert mich nicht\\" (Bend down, your face doesn't interest me.) The live performance became infamous, because of simulated rape. <br />The next song is also rather lewd, speaking about incest. The music, however, is brilliant, with some great, but strange, synth. The song is \\"Spiel Mit Mir\\" (play with me). <br />Klavier (piano) is slow, and dramatic, with some great lyrics. It's completely sung, and one of the better songs on the album. <br />Alter Mann (old man) has a catchy chorus and beautiful lyrics, but other than that it's nothing special. <br />Eifersucht (jealousy) is one of their stranger songs, with rather odd lyrics and heavy synth. It's an awesome song tho. Again, one of the album's best. <br />The closing track (on some versions), is extremely heavy on synth, featuring a purely synthetic interlude. The sfx mixed in are strange, and the chorus is extremely catchy. The result? A brilliant song that probably formed the foundation for another great song, Sonne (sun) on the Mutter album. This song is called Kuss Mich (kiss me). THe lyrics are, again, lewd. <br /> <br />On some versions, you will find a cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Stripped\\" as track 12. THis is an awesome song to begin with, so it's hard to screw up. The cover is an interesting take on it, with an awesome result. Definitely worth a listen. Till, despite having a very heavy german accent, makes this song sound great. <br /> <br />The two bonus tracks on the American version are nothing to speak of. They're merely english versions of \\"Du Hast\\" and \\"Engel\\". Keep in mind that these are incorrect translations, and Till's accent really doesn't work. We could have done without these. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this album is great. The best songs are hard to choose, so I've narrowed it down to Tier, Spiel Mit Mir, Klavier, Kuess Mich, Eifersucht and Stripped. This is a great album to get, but keep in mind that if you're not a Rammstein fan (or are but haven't heard their earlier stuff), you may not like the album at first listen. It's great, but it's a bit of an acquired taste. Especially the stranger songs like Eifersucht, Kuss Mich, and Spiel Mit Mir.
B0007O38F8|3.0|This can't touch \\"Get Rich or Die Try'n\\".  All his disses and self-created drama start to sound stupid.  What's he so angry about???  Dissing Nas is crossing the line.  How do you expect anyone who is a true fan of rap music to respect that?   <br /> <br />Album not bad -- just a case of over-hyping and under-delivering.   I will lose all the filler and put good tracks on my Ipod.  Songs where he is on other people's tracks have been better recently  (The Game, Eminnem and Snoop Dog). <br /> <br />I would recomend The Game's new album (Documentary) or Em's (Encore) over this one if you were to buy only one Dr. Dre protogee album.   <br /> <br />Of course if you haven't heard 50's first album I would reccomend that. <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 Cent thinks that he is god's gift to rap--which is far from the truth.. Some of the beats are decent, but the rap itself is bunk. It's all the same stuf from all 50's other songs being said over and over again. <br />He has no right dissing Jadakiss who is twice the MC that 50 Cent. Bottom line...IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE SAME OLD CRAP THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD MANY TIMES OVER then buy this piece of crap album.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I grow up leasoning to priest and have been longing for a new great Priest record.  When the trendy Turbo album hit, I lost faith in priest.  But now Angels of Retribution comes out swinging with Rob at the helm.  This CD is a cross between Sad Wings of Destiny and Defender.  It's great that Priest didn't try to reinvent themselves or try to put a modern twist on this CD but simply continue where their great ones left off.  IF YOU LIKE OLD PRIEST BUY THIS CD!

B0006IIPIK|3.0|The opening robot attack had me agog with delight, reminding me of the old \\"Mars Attacks\\" bubble gum cards, as well as old favorite movies like \\"Kronos\\" and \\"War of the Worlds\\" (whose ray gun sound effects are utilized here). After the robots leave, however, the movie kind of drags. Although the visual effects are worthy of the phrase \\"like nothing you've ever seen,\\" there's an overall darkness to the picture that doesn't let up, even when strolling through supposedly idyllic Shangri-La. But the poorest aspect of the film is the human element, or lack thereof. The characters are somewhat less than two dimensional. Law and Paltrow play their parts very low key, if not somnabulistic, and Ribisi's character has no personality at all. The addition of Laurence Olivier's ghost is pointless. And apart from one milk of magnesia gag, which gave me short-lived hopes for engaging, ironic characters a la \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" the people in this movie never do anything human: they don't smoke, drink, eat, look in a mirror...They are merely ciphers there to move the plot along at a sketchy, breakneck pace. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this mix of retro nostalgia and CGI-candy. I also enjoyed the many allusions, which included, apart from those already mentioned in other reviews here, \\"King Kong,\\" \\"Lost Horizon,\\" \\"Iron Giant,\\" and even \\"Godzilla.\\" The DVD is flawless. The gag reel is an unfunny waste of time. And if you like \\"Sky Captain,\\" try \\"The Rocketeer\\" if you haven't already.
0743454537|5.0|This book presented the characters as people you could relate to.It was one of those novels you could not put down.Feelings ranged from happy to sad for the reader. <br />The real emotions of the characters came though.When I finished <br />I felt apart of this family. <br />I recommend this book and think it is the best novel I have read in a long time. <br />Sincerely <br />Leah <br />
B0006284JQ|1.0|brittney needs to put on some clothes in the first place.  No, i'm not jealous of her, so don't think that i envy her.  Her main sellers are girls.  No straight girl wants to see brittney concealed by only a bra and undies.  What a role model!!  As far as her music, it sucks, not to mention all of her music is computer generated, along with her voice.  Obviouly modest is a foreign word to brittney.  No wonder why many teenage girls are walking around like they are worth $5.00.  What happened to the 50's and 60's modesty?  It is a shame that people have become primitave in their clothing again, wanting only to parade around in next to nothing.
0345308239|5.0|What makes Ms. Tuchman's writing so relevant is how it forces the aware reader to apply the lessons learned onto today's contemporary issues.  Moreover, the detail of British perspectives during the Revolutionary War was worth the price of the book alone.  Anyone looking for some original work about how the dangers of groupthink and the echo chamber continually lead to ultimate failure should purchase this book.
068987474X|5.0|I have actually never felt moved to write a review for book on the net before, but have to make an exception. <br />I have been in the most heartwrenching situation for an entire year because of a guy who seems to come and go from my life whenever he feels like it, and I know that I'm not alone there. I couldn't even count the number of hours I have spent crying about it, the number of friends who are tired of hearing about it, and the number of excuses I have heard for the way I've been treated. The extreme effort I have put into restoring this relationship has been so consuming that I have been unproductive in all most other areas of my life during this time. <br />I have to admit that I am writing this review only the day after starting on this book, and am only part way through. But even in that short amount of time, I have deleted this persons contact details (which I know I will no longer need) with the only regret being that I wasted so much time over the last year. I have also started to review my priorities and have so many positive things to start putting that previously wasted energy into... like finding a better job, studying, and meeting new people. <br />If your situation sounds anything like mine, please give this book a go. I don't know how much longer I would have gone on, not really even living my life, if I hadn't picked this up and started reading it.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I've never lost my taste for Heavy Metal, and JP is the ultimate Heavy Metal band.  I bought this as soon as it was available, and have listened to it several times already.  A very good album, and there is no denying that it is very good to have Judas Priest back.  This is what makes it hard to be nit-picky on this album, because though it isn't earth shaking, it is so good to have them back that you embrace it.
B0007O38F8|2.0|Forget the diss track the new cd is ok but when you think 50 cent you want great. he even sed that if this cd sells one copy less than get rich it was a failure. Sorry buddy you failed this cd has 22 tracksat least 10 tracks are decent and only 4 tracks are hot. When you have 8 songs on a cd that are garbage you're cd sux. Young Bucks cd was better than this one. Plus the reason he dropped Game is because people where gonna know he was better than him once his cd dropped and people saw how horrible it was. To be hones Artist who have dropped a cd have failed to equal theyre one before it, Nas cd wasn't as good as God son, Ludacris Cd was also crap to me to two hottest albums that have dropped in the last couple of moths are T.I urban Legend, & games gift wich I think is a classic ( don't get me wrong it isn't as good as get rich or dye trying but it was better than every G-unit album that dropped after it). JAdakiss is better, Fat joe is better and Nas is better than this Clown. (...)
0440237688|1.0|I read this book in my 8th grade English class and I was thoroughly disgusted. I had recently read 1984 the summer before and found the elements of Lowry's community more than curiously similar to Orwell's. It seems to me as if Lowry watered down Oceania into a book suitable for children, forfeiting the intensity and powerful writing in the process. If you're going to teach children about what it is to live devoid of joy or pain, use a good book for once. I did like \\"Number the Stars\\" by Lowry and was dissappointed that she would stoop to this level of imitation.
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge-One Day Remains is a great cd 2 have if ur a hard rockish metalish kind of person. If you liked Creed or even disliked them, you'd probably fall in love with this cd. <br /> <br />The way I got this cd was because I had a bunch of money left on my Wal-Mart gift certificate and I wanted to waste it on something. Hmm... How bout I just buy the Alter Bridge cd (again, I only wanted to waste my money)? I didn't even know how good they were. The first time I listened to them, they were my favorite band. <br />Here are my reviews: <br /> <br />Find the Real-10/10- Awesome guitar. Great chorus. You might have heard this on WAAF or something. <br /> <br />One Day Remains-8/10- Good song. Not great, but good. <br /> <br />Open Your Eyes-9/10- Most famous song. Good, but still not one of my favs. <br /> <br />Burn It Down-10/10- Exellently written song!!! Starts out slow and gets a little heavy. I love songs like that. My second favorite song. <br /> <br />Metalingus-10/10- The fastest song. Great opening. <br /> <br />Broken Wings-Don't remember? <br /> <br />In Loving Memory-8/10- I don't know why I like this song. It's so mellow and the singer has a great voice. Ha...Coolioolio!!! <br /> <br />Down to My Last-7/10- The only bad song. <br /> <br />Watch Your Words-10/10-       THE GREATEST SONG IN THE UNIVERSE!!! I don't know how they did it. Metallica fans would love this song. The best guitar, awesome chorus, oh and          THE GREATEST SONG IN THE UNIVERSE! I would have gotten this cd just cause of this one song. <br /> <br />Shed My Skin-8/10-Good but not great. <br /> <br />The End Is Here-10/10- The only reason this song is so good is cause of the ending.  It blew me away. <br /> <br />People who like Ill Nino, Spineshank, Creed, Metallica, Seether, Chimaira, Crossfade, Chevelle, and other rock bands... BUY THE CD!!! Even people who don't like the bands should buy it anyway. Myles has a great voice, but you should worry most about the guitar. Remember, Ijust bought it for no good reason and it turned out great. Take my advice and buy Alter Bridge's- One Day Remains.

B0007P3582|3.0|Ok, we all know 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin' was a gangsta classic and put both 50 n G-unit on da map, but let's just say The Massacre slipped just a lil below everyone's expectations 4 50 to top his 1st cd. On this cd, there aint no supa hits like Many Men, Wangsta, In Da Club, PIMP, or What Up Gangsta (partly because Dr. Dre isnt makin' mos of da beats). In fact a lot of da tracks on this cd sound alike. But its not just the beats, 50 somehow downgraded from his clever lyrics that were on GRODT. It's not all bad though. The songs that really stand out on The Massacre are: I'm Supposed to Die Tonight(a lil like Many Man), Ski Mask Way(unique beat), Dicsco Inferno(club hit), Outta Control(Dre does it again), Baltimore Love Thing(he's addicted 2 girls addicted 2 drugs), Postion of Power(can u say egomaniac?), and Hate It Or Love It Remix(G-Unit). Considering there's 21 songs on the cd, that's not a lot. However, songs like Gatman and Robbin'(Eminem) and Piggy Bank(beef track but no Back Down) are kinda growin' on me. Overall, The Massacre is a gritty album that still doesn't live up 2 50's 1st masta piece:GRODT. <br />Bottom Line: The Massacre shoulda been called The Mediocre.
B000009RC2|5.0|There are just some experiences you NEVER forget, and for me, at age 15 was hearing this groundbreaking disc by The Mahavishnu Orchestra! My initial impressions were of complete awe, even a bit of terror, wonderment, curiosity and a determination to get my brain around this frighteningly intense yet very spiritual and lofty music.  Years later, it STILL stirs many of those same feelings for me.     One of the most striking things aside from the music itself (a very natural, unforced vet fierce melding of Coltrane, Hendrix, blues and Indian ragas) was John McLaughlin's choice of musicians. Jerry Goodman was the only member of MO Mk I that had no previous jazz experience, yet was able to integrate his classical, folk and rock sensibilities into the mix very beautifully! Jan Hammer bought to the table an incredibly varied and colorful piano style and even turned in some SMOKING organ and Rhodes (a shame he didn't play more organ, he sounded GREAT on it!). Drummer Billy Cobham had just the right balance of sheer technique and soul (having logged in time with Miles Davis and James Brown among others). Bassist Rick Laird provided a solid bedrock for the others to build on, yet if you listened closely, he played very melodically in an understated way. Five VERY headstrong musical personalities like this coming together made for some exciting musical fireworks AND for some serious personal tensions (which would blow the band apart a couple years later), but in that brief time, revlutionized music!    1. Meeting Of The Spirits - Beginning with a powerful introduction of mysterious chords and swirling sounds, the band calls us to higher loftier realms, with McLaughlin playing EVERY NOTE as if his life dpended on it. Great opener with mesmerizing power and ferocity!     2. Dawn  - Starting off low key with Hammer chiming away on his Rhodes, the band lets forth a gently soaring melody that gradually builds intensity to some fiery interchanges between Goodman and McLaughlin before winding back down.     3. Noonward Race - Full throttle for John as he leads the band through a funky raga-ish wild ride, interesting solo from Jerry Goodman and one just marvels at how they play this fast and STILL land on the right spot!     4. A Lotus On Irish Streams  The romantic/classical side of McLaughlin Goodman and Hammer comes out with this dense yet very beautiful piece, conjuring up vivid images of rural Ireland and Britain.     5. Vital Transformation - Billy Cobham leads the charge at an insane tempo as McLaughlin and Goodman come in with a raga-ish figure that builds to frightening intensity and just as you think it's going to blow up, the whole band scrreches to a near halt and delivers a rousing melodic chorus before picking up steam again. McLaughlin's solo here is not only notable for its intensity but also tons of melody takes place at frightening speeds. I LOVE the edge of the seat flavor of this piece!     6. The Dance Of Maya - The blues holds sway here, as McLaughlin's deliberate and ominous arpegiated figures give way to an equally ominous melody from Goodman's violin, and then the band gets down to DA BLOOZ for abit before coming back to that ominous main theme and blowing the roof off the joint with a rousing ending. Call this blues from another dimension!         7. You Know, You Know - In a quieter more introspective vein, McLaughlin paints the scene with a minor key blues-inflected figure as his bandmates weave in and out interjecting a key moments. An understated masterpiece of building something very complex off a relatively simple figure. This would sound great in some parts of a detective flick!        8. Awakening - With all the subtlety of an air-raid-siren going off next to your bedroom window, the whole band unleashes a ferocious raga-like fusillade at a frighteningly fast tempo and then Jerry Goodman lets forth a soaring yet fierce melodic Middle Eastern-inflected solo on his violin. The band miraculously comes back at fullthrottle and then Hammer gets his turn, the tempo slows down a bit as he unleashes brilliant ideas which are gradually mutated and twisted beyond recognition with a ring-modulator on his Rhodes, and without warning, that raga figure roars back, and this time McLaughlin takes it out (and I mean OUT!!!) into space with his ferocious yet melodious solo and thenm somehow manages to bring the band back in as it lands on its feet with ungodly precision!    At first, all I could say was HOLY (...), HOW DID THEY DO THAT?     Years later, that feeling STILL happens when I pull this disc out.     Want mindblowing? Listen here!
B0007O38F8|4.0|I read all of these reviews before I went to get the 50 cd to see what other people thought and realized that most of you don't really know what you want.  If you bought the 50 cd thinking you were gonna get uplifting, thought provoking music, you must be crazy, because thats not 50.  Basically, the massacre is the same type of music 50's been coming out with since he's been out and if you thought he was gonna change it you are mistaken.  His music sells because WE buy it.  I just think the market is driven to build and destroy successful artist.  And to those out there that say Buck, Game, or Banks cd's are better than this, you need to take a second look.  50's influence is all over there stuff.  The only reason people think this cd isn't as good as GRODT is because its not.  But based on what is in demand, its HOT.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|The concert tour was amazing and the range of Michael Jackson classics is amazing

B0007GAEW6|5.0|It's official &quot;The Mars Volta&quot; defy genres, seamlessly blending a huge base of musical styles and pull it off where very few could succeed in &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;. Frances the Mute is not De-loused in the Comatorium (which I believe had a much more aggressive tone)this album plays very differently (more psychedelic, more creative) and builds on the Mars Volta as a band. Mars Volta is lined with such excellent musicians and concepts that they can create different music using their personal sound e.g. Omars psychidelic/funky guitar style, and Cedric's really high registered singing. <br />Breakdown of Songs:<BR>1) Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus: Starts off with a sweet little quiet part and enters into a hard section with Spanish lyrics before turning to English. then you get as close to the most basic verse section as you're likely to find on this album (and it isn't basic)then you get a 2 1/2 min. breakdown, with some sweet guitar. Then it hits a bridge-like section which absolutely blows me away every time (wicked drums and really high vocals, and weird guitar) chorus, followed by an &quot;on the run&quot; (Pink Floyd) like section of driving cars and such (really cool) which leads into song 2...<br />2) The widow: The only song on the album capable of being a single i.e. under 4 mins (without trance ending) amazing song. go to [...] and check it out if you havent heard it... awesome guitar, lyrics/singing, drumming, and trumpet!<br />3) L'via l'viaquez: like nothing else the Mars Volta has done ever easily their most inventive song to date. starts out with a short but sweet guitar solo. This song goes from Spanish to English frequently and is amazing even if you dont understand. The Spanish part is the harder part, while the English is almost rhymically spoken/whispered to a really funky beat (you really have to hear it). Incredible... really sweet leader into the next track...<br />4) Miranda that Ghost just isn't holy Anymore: beautiful piece of music. Miranda is led in by either singing guitar or Cedric singing (I honestly can't tell listen closely before trumpets you'll understand)this song has amazing lyrics and the singing is so high it'll send a chill down your spine. Amazing drumming right before final chorus, trumpets, bass, guitar, everything melds together for this song flawless outro leaves your guard and almost lulls you to sleep however...<br />5)Cassandra Geminni: Hits you hard right off. wicked intro solo's and singing, followed by distorted vocals and an amazing, this song is huge roughly 30 mins.. and features everything youd come to expect from the Mars Volta. Amazing vocals, guitar, bass, drumming. And elements you would rarely find in modern music hack* cough* almost a full orchestra! Amazing sax solos amazing lyrics, really inventive movements (yes musical movements!!) This song is longer then many modern CDs alone and is light years away from most pieces of music made by artists currently. This entire song is absolutely amazing! And I absolutely love the ending... everything goes together perfectly and forges a perfect piece of music.  <br />When I first heard this CD I pretty much lied there listening for the full 76 minutes, time seemed to fly by... If you want to chill out and hear an amazing piece of music buy Frances the Mute for probably less then 10 bucks. Sit down and listen, go ahead waste your life... I know I will!
B000000OUJ|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST WU SOLO EVER PRODUCED. IT HAS SO MANY CLASSICS IT'S CRAZY. THIS ALBUM IS CONSTANLY PLAYING IN MY CD PLAYER. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE \\"LIQUID SWORDS\\", \\"DUEL OF THE IRON MIC\\", \\"SHADOWBOXIN\\".
6305426651|2.0|This movie took me completely by surprise. It went from goofy to just ODD. The beginning wasn't too bad, but there was far too much time spent introducing the characters. Too many of the characters \\"disappeared\\" throughout the movie as well. And I don't mean they were killed off. What happened to Guido's friend in the beginning? What ever happened to Dora's fiance? What was the significance in the grandmother's reappearance? And what about the doctor and \\"It has to be the duckling!!\\"? Wasn't he reintroduced to the story in order to help and play some part in the outcome? But he really didn't at all. And personally, I hardly think there's anything funny about Nazi death camps. (Which, by the way, were not portrayed as severe as in actuality. I realize the movie was not meant to be historical, but I don't find myself very comfortable with this sugar-coated version of a camp, especially when so many people have actually denied the existence of them all together, it just seems too touchy -and important- a subject to overlook its seriousness.) Although the father may have had good intentions continually lying to his child, in reality that kid would have just turned out really MESSED UP, not to mention Guido would have been killed nearly 10 times throughout the movie. The movie drags on too long for a plot with no real climax. Two stars for good actors and a cute kid. But a more appropriate title for this movie would be \\"Life is Strange and Unrealistic.\\" I suppose that wouldn't be a big seller..
B00006690G|5.0|EVERYTIME EM PUTS OUT A NEW ALBUM IT SEEMS TO GET BETTER AND BETTER EXCEPT FOR \\"ENCORE\\". THIS ALBUM IS A CLASSIC EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST 3 YEARS OLD. DON'T GOT THEN GO OUT AND GET IT NOW. I LIKE EVERYSONG ON THIS CD.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|As much as I would like to champion an independent movie made on a small budget, in this instance, I cannot. <br /> <br />The movie suffers largely from being plotless and the characters being unlikeable and largely unfunny. The uncle in the movie has some occasionaly funny moments but the rest of it is bland and lifeless.  <br /> <br />Don't get me the wrong. The acting is excellent... but the Characters are so fatally annoying that watching the movie becomes a burden. <br /> <br />Reading through the reviews it seems obvious that the majority of people who have given this movie 5 stars are geeks who can relate to the characters in the movie.  <br /> <br />If you are not a geek or not being bullied then the film is quite frankly urinatarily microscopic in its pisitional farcance of blimpish follery.
B000002WPI|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS DIFFENTLY ON OF MY TOP 3 IF NOT #1 ALL TIME. THIS IS THE BEST WU TANG CD EVER PRODUCED. IT IS CONSTANTLY PLAYING IN MY CD PLAYER.

0684859106|5.0|Though I've only made the Traditional Vanilla Birthday Cake with the Traditional Vanilla Buttercream in cupcake version twice, I still love this book. I've never tried the cupcakes from the bakery, but a friend who has said they taste exactly the same. To be honest, I wasn't impressed with the cupcakes at first, but the more I ate them, the more I craved them. Now I'm addicted to them! I can't wait to try out more recipes from this book. I just wish they had more pictures... (I'm a sucker for yummy pictures.) But overall, I love this book.
B0002YLC24|5.0|FAO: Richard Linklater - please don't forget to make the next one in the series (in 2014?). <br /> <br />The sheer number of reviews for these films gives an indication of how they reach people. <br /> <br />Not perfect - sometimes the characters are a little too focused on giving their own thoughts, rather than really listening to the other - but the extraordinary qualities of this film totally outweigh such criticisms. For example, just wonder at her face in the car when he talks about his dreams...  And the final scene... <br /> <br />Tremendous and wonderful.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day <br />\\"American Idiot\\" <br />Reprise Records <br />2004 <br /> <br /> <br /> Green Day is considered to be a punk-rock band. Punk is a kind of music that is simple and has a little bit of rock. Punk-rock has a little bit more rock to it. Even though \\"American Idiot\\" is very different from their past albums, but they do have St. Jimmy and She's a Rebel that sound like they came off of Green Day's 1994 \\"Dookie.\\" With the exception of Whatsername and Wake me up When September Ends, which sound like it came off a Jessica Simpson album, this album still rocks. With hits like American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams, this album is for any kind of music fan. <br />  <br /> What I really like about this album is how easy the songs are to play on guitar, bass, or drums. The cool thing about that though is that they are still awesome songs. Another thing is that people can relate to this album. Billie Joe Armstrong (the lead vocals and lead guitarist of Green Day) sings about a lot of different things that are for everybody. For example, he sings about how he doesn't like Bush, and also about some of his problems with his past girlfriend. I recommend this album for ages 13-21. Parents should beware because they do swear a little bit, but not that much. I think everybody should get this or any other Green Day albums for their collection of CD's, especially this one. If you get this one, I would try to get \\"Dookie,\\" because that album is awesome too. These guys are just so awesome!
B0006399FS|3.0|I can't believe the idiocy of most of these reviews.  The negative ones spend as much time bashing Bono's personality as the music itself, worrying about how much money U2 made from this (who cares?!?!?), or calling on the band to \\"Please quit now before you ruin your legacy!\\"  How would you know whether they have another great album in them?  Are you God?  If they quit we'll never find out.  And if they produce more bad albums you can just ignore them.<br /><br />On the other hand are 5-star people gushing about how wonderful this is, how life-changing, etc.  I'm really happy for anyone that can find that much enjoyment in this album but I don't belong to that camp either.  I've also noticed that half those people bash Pop as U2's biggest mistake.  What a joke!  Have you listened to the lyrics on Pop?  There are probably 5 tracks on Pop that are lyrically stronger than this whole album.<br /><br />This album isn't atrocious (by pop music standards), nor is it good (by U2 standards).  In sum, it is BORING.  There are some good songs and some pretty bad, but even the good ones are not great.  I think every single song on this album is marred by at least one bad moment, embarrassing lyric, production flaw, or something else that makes it disappointing.  It's not as if U2 has never released mediocre songs, but somehow things are different here.  I'll take October as an example of their oft-cited worst album (not agreeing or anything...)  October definitely has weaknesses, but it makes up for it with some soul, some kind of message, passion, desperation, rawness, unity, or ??? that this album lacks.  And remember that October was released just a year after Boy, that the lyric notebook was stolen right before they recorded, and that they weren't even real musicians yet.  Understandably, it has weak moments.  This album, on the other hand, has been 4 (!?) years in the waiting, over-hyped as the best one yet, etc.  I can't think of any excuses for it being as blah as it is.<br /><br />I love U2 and will continue listening to their music, being interested in what they're up to, possibly attending concerts... However, the main impact this album has had on me is making me appreciate Pop a whole lot more (in part because of all the reviews on Amazon.com refering to Pop!!!)<br /><br />One final thought: despite being a Christian, I can't stand the song \\"Yahweh.\\"  I don't want to bash Bono's expression of faith but I find it downright painful.  Any other Christians out there who feel like gagging when they hear this song (you either get me here or you don't), take heart.  There is a whole range of U2 songs that are much more spritiually moving (for me):Drowning Man, '40', Scarlet, Bad, One, Wake Up Dead Man, When I Look at the World, Still Haven't Found, Gloria, With a Shout, Until the End of the World, even Playboy Mansion.  Those songs have all moved me closer to God in some way.  Yahweh just moves me closer to the 'eject' button.
B0002234LS|4.0|Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) a writer in a remote house in upstate New York, encounters an \\"apparent\\" fan, a character named Shooter (John Turturro). Shooter has accused Mort of stealing his story and threatens to kill Mort and everyone he may have ever known if he doesn't fix the situation.<br /><br />Mort hires a special investigator (Charles Dutton to locate Mr. Shooter and try to stop him.<br /><br />Shooter begins affecting Mort and his life almost immediately, Mort's dog is killed, a man who saw Shooter talk to Mort is found dead, and crucial evidence that Mort could use to clear his name is destroyed. It is at this point that we start questioning what is real and what is not.  As a matter of fact the movie may have been inspired by a recent Russell Crowe movie.<br /><br />The movie motors on to a climax that is different from the normal genre and that is why I rate it so high.  Both Depp and Turturro give excellent performances and look for Timothy Hutton in a lesser role as the boyfriend of Depp's estranged-wife.
B000002H6C|5.0|In 1988, two years after Metallica bassist Cliff Burton perished in a tragic bus accident, the band release its final album of the '80s, ...And Justice For All. In addition to being their last release of the decade, the record marked an unfortunate turning point for the band that would lead them astray down the path of lame-ass alternative rock. ...And Justice For All marked the end of Metallica's progressive heavy metal years. The killer solos, complex song structure, and fast tempos would all be gone when Metallica resurfaced in 1991. Why the band felt they had to change I'll never know, but I and many others wish that Metallica had stuck to their guns and continued making the excellent thrash metal that made them famous. <br /> <br />Among the group's four albums from the 80's, this is the most peculiar. Sonically, Metallica sounds different - the heavy, thundering guitars now buzz thinly, the drums click more than pound, and newcomer Jason Newsted's bass is pretty much inaudible. Some may be turned off by the strange production, but Metallica more than makes up for it with their most ingenious and ambitious songwriting ever. This is their darkest, most intricate album, with the central theme of justice manifesting itself in James Hetfield's bleak, angry lyrics. Much of the guitar work, drumming, and songwriting on ...And Justice For All is simply unmatched. Though opinions of the album are somewhat divided among Metallica's ever-dwindling fanbase, I view the album as a masterpiece from a band in its prime. Sadly, just two albums later, Metallica had become a shadow of its former self, and has never quite recovered from its commercial breakthrough. But if all good things must end, then ...And Justice For All is the perfect way to bring Metallica's glory days to a close. <br /> <br />The tracks: <br /> <br />Blackened - After a truly excellent guitar fade-in, the opening track picks up into a headbanging storm. Everything about this song rocks. The chorus is great, the bridge is great, the lyrics and vocal delivery are captivating, and the guitars and drums are top-notch. Outstanding. <br />...And Justice for All - Talk about a 1-2 punch. The title track somehow manages to live up to the awesome Blackened. This song is incredible - nearly 10 minutes in length, its lyrics paint a chilling picture of a society in decay. The complexity of the song structure makes it difficult to effectively descibe, but rest assured that it is a spectacular and highly satisfying listen. <br />Eye of the Beholder - The band employs another fade-in here. While it's not up to par with the first two tracks, this is still a very good song. I love the chorus in particular. The solo is nicely done, too. <br />One - A nearly 8-minute epic, One starts off on a melancholy note as Hetfield tells the tale of a soldier stripped of nearly all his senses by a landmine. Near the end, the song becomes heavy as hell as Hetfield voiced the anger and agony of a man permanently suspended between life and death. Not only is it a superb headbanger, its powerful lyrics make it a starkly moving song. One of the band's best ever. <br />Shortest Straw - Listeners of Michael Savage should be familiar with this one. It's a solid track, though personally not one of my favorites. Still a good, heavy song. <br />Harvester of Sorrow - I love this one. A slow, menacing track about how child abuse gets passed down through the generations. The guitars are sweet. <br />Frayed Ends of Sanity - Another one I like a lot. It just rocks. Very cool song. I especially love the lyrics and Hammet's guitar work. Oh, and it has an amusing musical in-joke at the beginning. <br />To Live Is to Die - I heard the band wrote this instrumental as a tribute to Burton. Seems likely, as it conveys both sadness (the beginning, middle, and end) and anger/despair (everything in between). The acoustic guitars and strings on this song are very well done. Another deeply emotional track. <br />Dyers Eve - Just awesome. Hetfield screams of parental neglect and indifference as the power chords roar and the drums fly at breakneck speed. A perfect way to conclude Metallica's glory years - with a kick-ass headbanger. <br /> <br />And that's it. One wonders how many more great albums the band could have made if they had only repeled the forces of commercialization. What could have been... <br /> <br />Steve Sweeney <br />
B0006J28KU|3.0|I think Heat is a great movie, but the DVD trannsfer was not that great. The picture quality was nothing special, but the sound was terrible. The effects track was alot louder than the dialogue and the bass track was absent in all the scenes except for the scene at the airport where the bass track seemed to be way too high. I'm sure I'll love the extras, but the DVD was a lackluster transfer.
0385504209|5.0|Fasten your seatbelts.  This book is one heck of a ride.  _The Da Vinci Code_ is more than a journey in search of the Holy Grail and far more than your typical murder mystery/who-dun-it.  It concerns the history of the Priory of the Scion, an extraordinary brotherhood formed in the middle ages and perpetuated to the current day to protect the mystique and secrecy of the Holy Grail.  The Church is terrified that the Grand Master and his colleagues know of the existence of ancient documents which if revealed could shake the church down to its very foundations.  One past Grand Master of the Priory of Scion was Leonardo Da Vinci, whose \\"Last Supper,\\"  \\"Mona Lisa,\\" and other masterpieces contain clues pertaining to the relationship of Jesus and the much slandered Mary Magdelaine, and how certain powerful and reactionary forces have a vested interest in suppressing the importance and meaning of their bond.  The book explains the dual meaning of the term \\"Sangreal\\": San Greal or Holy Grail vs. Sang Real or bloodline.<br /><br />First and foremost a crime mystery, _The Da Vinci Code_ begins with the murder of the curator of the Louvre.  The victim is the current Grand Master of the Priory of Scion and grandfather of Sophie Neveu, who together with Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of symbology, endeavor to locate the Grail and to understand better its deeper meaning, or what the book refers to as the attempt to recapture \\"the Sacred Feminine\\" that was eradicated by power hungry male religious leaders (possibly starting with Jesus disciple, Peter).  The book is packed with puzzles, cryptograms and poetry containing clues as to the whereabouts of the Grail.  Conspirators--and their identities shocked and surprised me--ensure that those who do not serve their purposes are promptly disposed of.  _The Da Vinci Code_ presents great works of art and structures of historic architectural splendor as vital \\"characters\\" in a riveting thriller that I found impossible to put down.
B00006879E|5.0|I've just read some positive reviews written before mine and I do agree: Maroon 5 is refreshing and very good. I also want to ask everyone's opininon about something that struck me while I was listening to \\"Songs about Jane\\": does anyone else, besides me, finds similarities between Maroon 5 and Jamiroquai?
B0007O38F8|2.0|I managed to hear this album about 2 weeks before it was released to the public and I'm very thankful that I did...So I would not be one of the millions that are going to be sadly upset with the content of the album.  I only found 2 tracks on the entire album that I would not use the \\"FF\\" button on...\\"Get in my Car\\" and \\"Die tonight\\" the rest are just horrible...if not the beat then the lyrics.  50 has lost it and when he dropped The Game from G-Unit he dropped the best one from the G-Unit including 50...He should have been dropping Young Buck and Lord Banks, I know I am not alone when I say that I am feeling The Game for than both of those artist.  The entire thing with Piggy Bank is just something to help 50 sell records and everyone is buying right into...When your album is \\"sub-par\\" you have to find a way to make it sell and that is just what he did.  We all know that Jadakiss will kill 50 on the mic...it's going to wild when \\"Time is MOney\\" drops and Jadakiss \\"Airs Him OUt\\"...I predict that when the next 50 album drops we will be beefing with Eminem and DRE, dropped for Shady Records, and using the beef with Em to sell records.  This album was a Joke.  My best advice is find someone that has it and burn it...save your money.

Civil disobedience is an option that occured far beyond the days of civi disobedience,  But it has a vital point.  We, as tax payers are not regulated by tax without repensentation.

B0007GAEW6|4.0|It's nice to see that Frances the Mute is envoking such strong feelings in people -- albeit from polar opposites.  However, there is something that should be kept in mind when analysing this album ... it is unfair to grade it based on previous albums from conventional artists, as it wasn't painted with the same canvas.   <br /> <br />Firstly, stop trying to push The Mars Volta any number of genres.  On FTM, they complete the genrecide they began hurtling toward on Deloused.  I had a nice giggle when I read a review on here that said Dreamtheater would run circles around TMV.  Virtuosity is hard to quantify -- But if it's safe to say that John Petrucci is twice the technical guitarist that Omar Rodriquez-Lopez is, it's safer to point out that Dreamtheater's songwriting is a bead of sweat on The Mars Volta's giant jock strap.  And Cedric Bixler vs that sweating hog of a opera singer that ruins every non-instrumental Dreamtheater tune?  Well, it's 2-0 folks. <br /> <br />As for this album ... It's not that TMV singularly do anything that hasn't been done 4,864 times before, it's that they blend so many of these things together and do it so well that you can't help but be left in awe.  And by \\"you\\", I mostly mean musicians.  I'm sure there are a ton of other Mars Volta fans out there, but this isn't an album you'd give to your laymen buddies, lest you vomit at their ignorant response to music that doesn't play like so many Linkin Park albums. <br /> <br />I gave this album a 4 simply because there isn't a 4.5, which is what I feel it deserves.  If you want 5 stars, you'll pick up De-Loused, an album with twice as many songs and of quarter of the ambient effects.  Beautiful and haunting as these soundscapes are, they still only contribute to five total tracks, and I'd prefer to hear more. If this were a double album of 10 songs that played of for 154 minutes, it would be a 5.   <br /> <br />On the whole, these five tracks are hot, heavy, rock songs with aspects of all the genres and lovely titles we've gleefuly attached to them.  Punk, prog, space, alt, jam, metal, blues, jazz, salsa, etc.  They're here.  All of them.  If you buy this album and find the ambience annoying -- cut some tracks out and make your own CD.  But before you crucify these innovative and insanely smart musicians for being over-indulgent, listen to this album in its monsterous entirety, alone, in the dark -- and repeat it for a week.  You'll find beauty here like nothing you've heard before. <br /> <br />Or maybe you'll hate it.  Either way, you're right.
0679735259|4.0|To be honest, I had a little trouble wading through _Dispatches_ for several reasons.  First, and I believe foremost, I am simply too young.  Herr's book is steeped in place names and cultural references, as he takes you on a hypnotic wild ride through the forests of Vietnam.  Herr manages to pull off a conversational, stream-of-consciousness narrative.  The only problem is, I wasn't old enough for the conversation.<br /><br />Yet despite the fact that I lacked the historical knowledge to appreciate the book's references, one immediately gets the impression that it does not matter.  Herr's insightful commentary can exist on any battlefield, during any time, yet particularly manages to capture the particularly absurd circumstances of Vietnam.  As other reviewers have commented, _Dispatches_ is not a philosophical treatise on war.  It is not an impassioned political statement.  It is not conservative glorification or liberal backlashing.  Instead, Herr manages to cipher the images, steeped in the language of psychedelics.  The disoriented feeling the reader experiences while digesting these pages is akin to an acid trip:<br /><br />\\"We were all strapped into the seats of the Chinook, fifty of us, and something, someone was hitting it from the outside with an enormous hammer.  How do they do that?  I thought, we're a thousand feet in the air!...I was new, brand new, three days in-country, embarrassed about my boots because they were so new.  And across from me, ten feet away, a boy tried to jump out of the straps and then jerked forward and hung there...As the chopper rose again and turned, his weight went back hard against the webbing and a dark spot the size of a baby's hand showed in the center of his fatigue jacket.  And it grew-I knew what is was, but not really-it got up to his armpits and then started down his sleeves and up over his shoulders at the same time...and it was running slow, heavy drops off his fingertips.  I thought I could hear the drops hitting the metal strip on the chopper floor\\" (177-78).<br /><br />One really cannot describe this book, do justice to its narrative, or even truly examine the book from a literary perspective.  I do not believe that it was Herr's intention to create a novel \\"in the great line of Crane, Orwell and Hemingway,\\" as the Washington Post's review states.  This novel has to speak for itself.  It must be read like one would take psychedelics; it has to be absorbed by the reader in a frenzy and experienced for what it is.  It is journalistic prose delivered with the emotional impact of heart-wrenching poetry.ing the metal strip on the chopper floor\\" (177-78).   <br /> <br />One really cannot describe this book, do justice to its narrative, or even truly examine the book from a literary perspective.

B00000I07R|4.0|After the commercial smashes SLIPPERY WHEN WET and NEW JERSEY,the New Jersey-based Bon Jovi failed this time to repeat that success. Only two songs from this album,BED OF ROSES and the title track appeared on the 1994 compilation CROSSROAD. This album was released in the fall of 1992,four years after the release of NEW JERSEY. Frontman Jon Bon Jovi(legally Bongiovi) was at this time beginning to break into Hollywood. So,he and his band were slowing down on writing,recording and touring.
6305603847|5.0|This movie is amazing! But, I must say, I've seen it 3 times, and it is best watched in the dark, alone. That way you can take it all in without distractions. Having a snack is also good. <br />Okay, so this movie is about Roger Water's alter-ego, Pink, who slowly begins to alienate everyone and go insane. It takes us through his past, from his father dying, to his heartbreak with his wife. This movie is excellent, and despite other remarks, you DON'T have to be an expert at Pink Floyd to like this movie. Definitely no. And, you don't have to be on any hallucinagenic drugs either.  <br />No one has mentioned this yet, they all just talk about the band, but Bob Geldof (Who plays Pink) is so unbelievably awesome! He should have done more acting. I loved him in this movie!  <br />So, this movie is for anyone who likes a good flick that really makes you think. WARNING: You may be a little depressed after watching it for the first time. (I decided after watching this that I needed to decorate the Christmas tree- it was 2 in the morning by the way...) But, watch it more than once, you'll begin to love it!
B00000I07P|5.0|After two albums which were popular primarily with hard rock/heavy metal fans,this 1986 platinum smash spawned three Top 10 hits. YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME was one of the top hits of September 1986,when this album was released. The next hit was LIVIN' ON A PRAYER. Hey,is that Peter Frampton's \\"talkbox\\" on loan heard in the song? The other is WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE,which debuted on the radio in the spring of 1987. All those songs appeared on the 1994 compilation CROSSROAD which would contain a new version of LOAP entitled PRAYER '94. The other songs are great. Bon Jovi's 1988 follow-up NEW JERSEY would be a platinum smash as well.
1400032717|5.0|I rarely write a review for books that already have hundreds of reviews, but I wanted to express how this book is so incredibly moving.  This was the rare book that I did not want to finish.  It is one of the most innovative stories.  Imagine writing a book from the perspective of an autistic teenage boy.   <br /> <br />The author is experienced with developmentally disabled children, according to his bio.  I guess that many of his anecdotes are taken from real life experiences with youths of this type.  I do not work with this population, but there is little in this story that does not appear realistic.   <br /> <br />The author artfully uses secondary characters to further explain the boy's choice of action and his thought process.  I would, though, have preferred if the father's character could have been better explained as to why he made the decisions that so deeply affected his son, Christopher.   <br /> <br />Also I found it very accurate for an autistic child, that while one can be engrossed in his story, the reader is unlikely to fully understand this child since Christopher is never able to truly understand the other people he encounters.  One can enjoy the autistic-protagonist of this story, but one can never expect the protagonist to ever accept the other person other than from his restricted perspective.   <br /> <br />I would strongly support this book for high school age students and adults.  I would recommend it for even younger audiences, but for the occasional severe language of several characters in this book.  I will certainly look for this author's future novels, which will hopefully soon come. <br />
6305537321|5.0|I have wanted to see this movie since I found out what Tiffany's was....and I completely agree it also calms me down right away...<br /><br />Is she or isn't she?  That is the question that everyone seems to keep asking.  Is the kid (Holly Golightly) a fake or a real fake?  She's a real fake.  Holly Golightly is a very stylish girl, alligator shoes, long fancy dresses, and shades.  It can be determined that she's a call girl based on the amount of money she receives to go in the restroom, and the amount of male companions she has.  Not to mention her own reference to playing the field.  Holly is a very irrational young woman.  As Paul Varjack rings the bell in hopes of using her telephone and instant friendship is forged.  Paul a writer and a kept man himself with piercing blue eyes glimpse what the inside of Holly Golightly is all about.<br /><br />\\"We are friends aren't we?\\"  Holly asks Paul who she associates with the looks of her young brother who is in the Army that she misses dearly.  As the two partake in a friendship that opens the eyes of the other one it is apparent that love is in the air.  But can Holly Golightly in her urgency to find a rich husband overcome her case of the \\"reds?\\"<br /><br />This is another movie that captures the power of LOVE!
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|\\"I've Seen It All\\" is very inspirational, if you saw \\"Dancer In The Dark\\" you can almost see Bjork-Selma Jeskova tilting her head sideways and saying \\"What is there to see?\\".  \\"107 Steps\\" never made any sense to me until AFTER I saw the movie, I just thought it was fun, then when I saw the movie it brought tears to my eyes.  \\"Cvalda's Song\\" is touching, too, even if you didn't see the movie.  As you listen to this Soundtrack you'll hear Bjork's innocent \\"I Only Did What I Had To Do\\", though it is not worded that way.  This CD is based on the movie, but is different with the words.  Another Bjork sensation.  Buy this one.
B00006879E|1.0|And  bland beyond belief. I can only hope the Best New Artist Grammy Award Curse befalls this group. Look back in Grammy history and you will see the likes of Starland Vocal Band, Tracy Chapman, and Arrested Development as winners of that particular award whose careers went nowhere FAST. Maroon 5 are watered down, fourth division white boy blue eyed soul of the worst kind. Jamiroqui rip offs ( who themselves are Stevie Wonder rip offs ). Maroon 5 are so safe and  so corporate. The lead singer has an annoying whine of a voice and his lyrics are akin to reading the poetry diary of a \\"sensitive\\" high school freshman. Just terrible, and unfortunately, all over the place. THIS IS WHY I DON'T LISTEN TO THE RADIO !!!!
0385510454|1.0|Does anyone edit John Grisham's books, or do they just typeset whatever garbage he hands them and bind it up with his name on it in time for the annual release?  Seriously, NO ONE could have read this \\"book\\" and thought it deserved to be published.  The people at his publishing company DID NOT read this before selling it.  Absolutely no way.    The first sentence is a dead giveaway.  A presidency is described as one which would arouse less interest than any presidency in history other than the one-month term of William Henry Harrison---and then we are told that the incumbent president lost all the states but Alaska in his re-election bid, following several scandals caused by the president and the First Lady.  Call me---I don't know, LITERATE?---but it seems such a presidency might arouse just a little interest among historians.    And it gets worse.  It's as though Grisham wrote a 50-page novel and needed 307 more pages, so he decided his personal obsession with Italy and the Italian language would hold people's interest for 20 pages at a time before he moved what little story there is along.  I mean, Grisham has gone from brilliant (A Time to Kill, Runaway Jury, The Partner) to merely bad (virtually everything else) to god-awful (The Chamber, The Street Lawyer, The Testament), but this is definitely his all-time low.  Of course, it's possible the whole thing got better in the last 100 pages---life is too short to read this whole book.  Good thing I was given a copy for free.  Made me feel less bad when I tossed it in a trash can in downtown Chicago, to save the next poor sap who made the mistake of picking it up.
0140177396|5.0|George and Lennie, poor wretches traveling the country in search of work, dream of owning their own piece of land, their own piece of liberty. Never having to depend on someone else, never having to listen to what their bosses tell them to do, seems to be their ultimate goal. It all seems unachievable when they start to beg for work on yet another ranch in California. But then suddenly it all seems like a miracle is about to happen. In the face of their final redemption, they cannot help but start to plan their new life. But if they do not watch out, they might get in trouble again. Serious trouble.<br /><br />Like his other works John Steinbeck gives in Of Mice and Men voice to the lonely and deprived people struggling to survive in the American society at the time of the Great Depression. Although the setting of the story is quite sober and the characters do not have a lot of room to develop within the few pages this novella counts, the message is all the more convincing. The strong friendship between two men, linked together by fate, is heart-warming and honest, which contrasts even more with the violence of their surroundings. The controversial conclusion of the book reads almost as an invitation to reflect upon the true values of life.<br /><br />Is this book a historical illustration of the past (Great Depression) or a prophetical vision of the future? Many different opinions can be voiced, but isn't the American Dream still floating through our lives? Maybe our modern world is full of people like George and Lennie?<br /><br />The kind of critique voiced by Steinbeck is not always well received in the land of the Brave and the Free. It is quite sad that even today this book is banned from some schools and public libraries in America.
1586217194|3.0|I had occasion to drive to Austin from East Texas (4 hours, one way) and thought an audio book on CD might be a good way to break up what is a fairly monotonous drive. I thought I might like a science book, but after reading some reviews of the \\"professor\\" series and hearing that they were sleep inducing, I decided that may not be a good idea for a boring drive. I found \\"Blink\\" in audio at the bookstore and became intrigued. Like most scientists, I am a bit skeptical of pyschology in general, but I am also open minded. Gladwell's book proved to be perfect for the drive, almost like having an articulate and educated companion along for the ride--albeit the conversation is one-sided.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book in this venue. I would not have had the same opinion of the written version. The only reason that I don't give him more stars is that the cover is slightly misleading--the power of thinking without thinking--made me hope that he was going to offer a way to empower the subconscious. Anyone who has ever taken a test thinks about that \\"initial choice\\". So why doesn't that always work? In other words, shouldn't you be able to walk in to an exam, read the question, let your subconscious work for a second or two, write the answer down and move to the next question? Gladwell doesn't offer us anything here and he can't, he is a science writer, not a scientist. He can only report what he has researched. Excellent reporting, but no meat other than that. Get the audio book and listen on a long trip--but don't bother buying the paper.
B000088E6D|5.0|My wife asked me to look for this album because she heard Buble's version of Sway and loved it.  She hasn't been able to listen to the whole album yet because I keep stealing it to play in my car.  If you love the Big Band sound and the classic pop standards, this is WITHOUT A DOUBT, a MUST HAVE ALBUM.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I'm not much of a typer so let me say what I wanna say.  I love TMV.  Been a huge fan ever since the very beginning.  The first song I ever heard was Eunuch Provacateur, and I was hooked.  For some reason I love bands that don't play with what the industry has told them is the formula for success.  These guys are brilliant musicians, and they aren't even known to many people who would consider themselves savvy about music.  As far as Frances the Mute goes, I love this album.  That being said, it is not a perfect album.  There is a couple, but only a couple instances I felt that they could have used a bit tighter production (if Rick Rubin had done this album, I would have probably given it a 5), and there are a couple of times where everyone in the band seems to be going in different directions at once.  But the majority of the time, they do have it together, it is NOT De-Loused in the Comatorium, which is a great thing.  Only 5 songs, but each one seems to fly by (except for parts of Miranda and Cassandra Gemini).  Cygnus is a brilliant way to say \\"We're back\\" to the entire world.  The Widow to me is like their half-hearted commercial effort.  Still better than anything else on MTV.  L'Via is my second favorite song on the album, with TMV showing what they do best, which is bringing in many genres together to make beautiful music.  Miranda is a hauntingly beautiful song, yet they rock out.  Cassandra Gemini is a masterpiece.  They could have cut this down to about 26-27 minutes, and it would be even more outstanding.  But still, a 31 minute song, and I listen to it all the way through pretty much everytime.   <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent, excellent follow-up album.  It could have been better, but not much better.  Next time, allow Rick Rubin to produce again, because Omar is almost too creative for his own good.
B000002UAO|5.0|For those of us in our formative teen years when this album came out it was like an old mule looking at a new fence.  We didn't know what to make of it at all.  We knew the fab 4 had forsaken live performances but we had no idea that they were about to change the musical landscape forever.  There were no more \\"She loves You\\" songs here.  There were new instrumentations and incredible use of counterpoint in these new tunes.  And all the time they were just readying us for the awakenings to come with Revolver and Sgt. Peppers.  It was an amazing time and every listen takes me back to that wonderful feeling of discovery and adventure.
068987474X|4.0|He's Just Not That Into You... is a cute, yet humorous book.  In confession, I saw me in a lot of the pathetic behavior of the women, whether fact or fiction.  The classic is: Nikki.  She can't be real!  But then again... <br /> <br />Take it like a grain of salt.  If some of what was written burns you, then run some cold water over the wound and move on.  It's more like a lesson learned, not the new mantra for women in general.   <br /> <br />The book will definitely suit women who've been in some of the predicaments in the book.  For the other 20% who've NEVER experienced anything remotely similar to what was written, I suggest you write a book giving your secrets.  Be sure to add some credibility to it to make it \\"sellable.\\"  The writer/consultant/whoever of Sex in the City sold me...and Oprah played her part too.  Having actually read it confirmed the more positive reviews for me.  Ahaha!
B000001FDQ|1.0|Lots of fast classical riffs. This is an album meant to impress not inspire. Id rather listen to someone with deep soul than someone who just practiced scales for a few years and then decided to record an album. If you want a great instrumental album buy something from Eric Johnson, Steve Vai, Jeff Beck, or Steve Howe. This is just guitar masturbation.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|This movie is absolutely incredible. I loved this movie so much that I went out about an hour after I watched this movie and bought it. This movie will keep you guessing throught the movie. Once you think you have everything figured out, you don't have the least bit of clue to what is happening. I have shown this movie to a few of my friends, who are very tough on their movie ratings, all of them immediately told me that it was a great movie. I have the supreme confidence to tell anyone and everyone that this film is definetely guranteed for you to want to watch again.
B000001DQG|4.0|I share the common belief that Caribou (named after the Colorado ranch where Cpt. Fantastic, etc. were recorded) is largely a 2nd-tier retread of Yellow Brick Road. Elton earns 4 stars because he is, underneath the ugly glitz of the production's sound, a superior craftsman of the highest order in popular music. But one reviewer panned somewhat the best song here, \\"Ticking\\", mentioning the \\"overdubbed piano\\" as being somehow better than the vocal in capturing the mood.  Elton himself said he recorded this song without overdubs--that he couldn't otherwise do it justice [Actually,there's a bit of overdubbed synth and Elton's own harmonies on there].  The result is one of his top 5 all-time songs, and that is high praise indeed!  Being a pianist myself, I have to rate Elton's playing here as among the greatest performances of the instrument ever recorded.  I must be in the minority here, but Bernie Taupin's lyrics have nearly always come across to me as both overreaching AND trite; this album represents one of his worst efforts. But \\"Ticking\\" is in his storytelling milieu, which produced some of his better lyrics.  I similarly find the orchestrations/arrangements of Elton's albums at this point becoming increasingly overreaching and trite.  But the world can thank Elton for not letting them touch \\"Ticking\\". If you're not moved by this song, you may want an MRI.    Footnote: Why did I spend an entire review and your precious time talking about one song?  Because \\"Ticking\\" is really very much like many songs Elton wrote since the beginning, except that we hear Elton stripped to (almost) just voice and piano.  It's really the best way to hear his ballads, as anyone who's seen him in his solo acoustic piano concerts can attest [hear \\"Skyline Pigeon\\" on the live Here And There album].  NO orchestra or synth or studio effect can top Elton and a piano--our eternal regret is that his \\"people\\" didn't get that.  By the way, it's no coincidence that I rated Tumbleweed Connection to be Elton's best album--it contains Elton's only studio song with just voice and piano [\\"Talking Old Soldiers\\"].
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|This was a great film... until the end.  As I was watching it, it was easily a 4-4.5 star film.  It was suspensful and very well shot/directed.  Sean Penn, Tim Robins, and Kevin Bacon all play their roles marvolously.  The story line was a great one, and all the technical aspects of the film were perfect.  Then, the film started wrapping up.  It was at this point that I saw perhaps the worst, most bizar ending I've ever seen in a movie.  It had as little to do with the rest of the movie as part of a movie could possibly have.  The ending alone is what knocked my rating from a 4.5 to a 3.  It's a great movie, and definately worth a watch, but you'll be shaking your head as the credits start to roll.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|This album is the best of Anastacia! this rock's style is awesome. The best: left outside alone, seasons chages, sick and tired.
B00005O5UA|5.0|Well I am only 16 but I already love Queen. My mum always listened to them and I wasn't bothered but since I've found their music I haven't looked back. 'Made in heaven' to me is one of the most beautiful albums in the Queen collection. Every fan should have this album. The opening song titled 'It's a beautiful day' is a very beautiful song. Full of emotion. 'Made in heaven' previously off Freddie Mercury's solo album is a very good song. My favourite song has to be though 'A Winter's Tale'. It was the last song Freddie wrote but it is the best last song anyone could ever write. It really make you feel as if your in Montreux which is what the song is about. The untitled instrumental track is a very heavenly song. Alot of people have called it a musical journey to heaven and I agree it is very moving. Anyone who is a Queen fan should buy this album. Full of emotion and sadness but full of magic.
B000059XUO|2.0|The Crow was certainly a landmark film of Burtonesque ambience, and has understandably become a cult classic since its release.  However, despite the emotions the film inspires through its visuals, I fail to see what all the commotion is about.  To say that that the acting is sub-par, particularly on the part of Brandon Lee, is being gentle.  Lee's performance in particular is strikingly unconvincing, seeming overly contrived and forced, not to mention downright cheesy in places (I'm sure you all remember the hysterical scene of Eric playing a guitar on a rooftop in the middle of the night in all its histrionic glory).  Furthermore, the plot itself is trite and overdone, and to tell the truth, not particularly absorbing.  The \\"revenge from the beyond the grave\\" concept has been employed time and time again, not only in cinema, but in litterature as well.  The characters, while decently developed, are not believable.  Eric is simply too powerful, so much so that I found myself simply unable to willingly suspend my disbelief.  Overall, The Crow is a directionless movie, and hardly worthy of all its hype.
B000286S8S|5.0|This collection has almost all of their greatest hits except for a few semi- important ones. They could have and should have taken out the live songs and replace them with songs like Ice Cream Man. Overall this is a great collection and if you want the missing songs, then just download them.
B000005Z0E|5.0|This is 2pac's first ever solo album when he used to run with The Underground. This album isn's his best work but spark the doors for the start of a new chapter of the West Coast/East Coast Era. It was a good start but to tell you the truth it really is work bumping in your sterio or in your car you kinda get that 80s and 90s feeling and i really love that feeling. go get this if you dont get it its pretty damn good and its a very rare album to come buy.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Okay, I've seen a lot of movies, and this is definately up there, but I wouldn't have said that after the first time I watched it.  The first time, I was talking to my girlfriend, blah blah blah, and basically had NO clue what was going on at the end of the movie, and hence, hated it.  The second time, though, I paid attention and it was a totally different experience. <br /> <br />You will enjoy this movie if you pay attention.  I mean close attention.  Like don't go to the bathroom attention.  If you have ADD, move on now.  But this is a teen movie like none you've ever seen before.  It has time travel, violence, craziness, love, and a slew of other ideas going on.  It's a very psychological movie, and is made all the better by my personal favorite actress, the beautiful Jena Malone.   <br /> <br />You might want to keep your friends out of this one.  Lock yourself in the room after going to the bathroom, eating, whatever you need, and dont come out until it's over.  Believe me, it's worth it and you will NOT be dissappointed.  Enjoy!
B0006284JQ|2.0|I do not think  britney is prepared for a greatest htis, this album does not make any sense.

B0007TKNL0|1.0|A horrible disaster on almost all counts.  As it is easier to list the positive points I will concentrate on those first.  Emily Rossum does an admirable job singing and Miranda Richardson does a very good job of adding quite a bit more color to the otherwise limited role of Mme Giry (She also notably maintains a French accent throughout - not something that most U.S. actors are capable of).   <br />However, such bright points in the film are few and far between.  The direction is muddled between maintaining a respect for the stage musical source material and creating a perfume commercial background for Emily Rossum to sing in.  The art design is colorful and spectacular yet confused and deeply anachronistic.  The masquerade scene was completely butchered by the monochromatic costume design and anachronistic choreography.  <br />However, most dissapointing was the portrayal of the phantom.  The role was inextricably miscast.  The unfortunate thing about this is that much of this musical relies HEAVILY on the actors within it.  It is not a strong enough vehicle on its own to suffer such a crucial mistep in performance (particularly the lack of a strong, or emotionally persuasive singing voice).  Furthermore, and perhaps because the story is by now so well known, the Phantom [Gerald Butler] is given a much more central role.  This may have worked better if the actor were more captivating, but it will take more than an unbuttoned shirt to convince me that there is anything emotionally tortured or mysterious about this individual.  <br />In short this is the product of a most unfortunate misadventure in filmaking.  The most crushing dissapointment being the almost certain lack of a remake in the very near future, as this is a sorely inadequate representation of the stage musical or even of Gaston Leroux's story.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I am a woman in my 40's, extremely conservative (politically), so I'm probably not considered a member of the target audience for this film.  That said, this was perhaps the funniest movie I have ever seen.  I was probably the only one in the theater who laughed hysterically during the entire vomit scene.  I rarely go to the movies, but I saw this one three times in one week!!!!  I bought the soundtrack immediately after seeing the movie.  During my morning commutes to work, which are over an hour, I listen to the soundtrack and it puts me in the best mood.  Buy the DVD and buy the CD.  And if you don't like them, you need to lighten up and quit taking yourself and everything else so seriously.
B0007O38F8|1.0|wack. i got the bootleg of this. and i'm glad too. because i'd be kicking myself if i bought this trash. 50 cent is the biggest phony in rap today. he depends on gimicks to sell. his first album it was i got shot nine times. and now it's i'm going to diss every rapper from ny who's better them me. dissing jada is you crazy. and you ain't gangsta. getting shot and getting stabbed don't make you gangsta it means gangsta ni**as made you their victim and tried to kill you and you didn't do nothing. all you do is snitch and then hire millions of security to protect yourself. you cant even step foot in ny without the whole police precint. that ain't gangsta rolling with the cops.     with that out the way let me talk about the new album. in one word trash. game's cd had better beats and 50 lyrics have gotten to a pitiful low. and why he singing on every last track? didnt he diss ja rule for doing that? hypocrite. he dissed ja so he could become the new ja rule. and that chick he got singing on candy shop is wack.
B0007O38F8|2.0|This is pretty much an average CD it starts of with a good song In MY Hood. i have to tell you. i was pretty happy with the first 7 tracks. then when i got to Disco INferno, Candy Shop, Baltimore Love THing. then it got bubblegum. as i can see it. the first tracks are gangsta then it goes to being a love album. the beats were pretty good but im pretty much mad at him and i really dont like 50 as a person anymore. after he started beefing with Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne, all over sum stupid Sh*t. and he aint the next pac. he isnt even as great as pac. he is kinda repeating himself with what pac did but at least when pac rap he wasnt an ignorant F**k like 50 is. pac still rapped about problems in the hood, society. pac diss anyone who was with biggie, as 50 diss everyone associated with ja rule. when pacs career started, he rapped about black power and how his life is bad. and 50 started off his rap career with beefing with the top rappers. and to tell you the truth, do i really wanna buy records from someone who brags about how much money he has and how he is better than me? at least when pac was rapping he was telling everyone how he feels and he had sumthing to stand for. what does 50 have to stand for? his anger at ja? is that really something to stand for? hes 28 years old and acting like a jealous high school kid. if you wanna get the album, just download it dont buy it,50 doesnt need anymore money and i dont want him getting anymore money just rip the Cd and download he doesnt need money cuz hes wack. i want to see him broke and out the rap game.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Idealistically, there are few things more appealing than the apocalyptic notion of complete isolation. Large scale worldwide end-of-the-world apocalypse or small, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type trapped-on-a-deserted-island seclusion, we have all been occasionally aroused by this type of all-alone-in-the-world separation. Ever since the dawn of mass civilization and the overwrought hustle and bustle of the modern world, being The Only People/Person on Earth has inspired thousands of years worth of art and literature for its romantically serene notions, dating back to and beyond the fable of Adam and Eve from Christianity. Usually a combination of loss and innocence- first the loss of power, whether it take the form of god, government, or even parents, and second, a perceived \\"return to innocence\\" because of this loss- the one thing that our art has taught us is that, basically, the apocalypse sucks. It's cool for a little while, but ultimately loneliness sets in, we freak, and begin to want more than this nothing, having come from a society where we are conditioned to want Everything. Even on South Park the kids couldn't last long without their parents, and in 28 Days Later, Jim can't get on without believing that \\"society\\" still exists somewhere. <br /> The opening menagerie from the Arcade Fire's debut album, \\"Funeral,\\" plays out a frosty mini-apocalypse, complete with icy parents, tunnels under the snow, a vampire brother, and a year of darkness. \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" introduces the metaphorical End Of The World, as snow buries the houses and our narrator and his lover make their way alone (\\"we let our hair grow long and forget all we used to know\\"). Forgetting their parents (\\"whatever happened to them?!\\") and all the names that they were going to name their baby (\\"we forgot...\\"), their \\"skin gets thicker from living out in the snow.\\" This all goes down beneath a gorgeous piano and xylophone twinkling, like a patient, classical version of Interpol. The second neighborhood tune (Laika) introduces us to perhaps the progenitor of the metaphorical apocalypse, a brother named Alexander, bit by a \\"vampire\\" and forced to drink a years worth of his \\"tears in a cup\\" for his own good and for the sake of the neighborhood. Emotionally driven and resonating beyond this realm, singer Win Butler makes like Ian Curtis, encouraging the neighbors to \\"dance in the police disco lights\\" brought on by Alex's fights with their father. Only the next to last track, \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" comes close to matching the emotion of the opening couplet, but you'll need the rest.  <br /> The opening quintet concludes with a mellow, half French soiree about \\"Une annee sans lumiere,\\" with darkness enveloping the hood for a year. Finally, our narrator wakes up with the neighbors \\"all shoutin' that they found the light,\\" only to find the power out \\"in the heart of man.\\" The neighborhood tale is concluded with a pensive realization about the frightening sadness and regenerative power of time- \\"time keeps creepin' through the neighborhood/ killing old folks, wakin' up babies.\\" <br /> The second half of the album breaks from the neighborhood theme, but not from a lack of thematic cohesion. \\"Haiti\\" is a love ballad to the homeland of Regine Chassagne that \\"she'll never see\\", complete with a spookily transparent synth line and rushing waves that ache and break like John Lennon. Crying for the children in their \\"unmarked graves where flowers grow,\\" she spiritually exorcises the demons of war and violence, promising that \\"all the tears and all the bodies will bring about our second birth.\\" <br /> Already legendary, the bands mystique only plays up the emotional weight of the debut. After the marriage of Butler and Chassagne and during the recording of \\"Funeral\\", the band lost nearly ten family members amongst them during the \\"terrible winter of 2004,\\" according to liner notes (hence the title as well). This is dealt with on the album's denouement, a bjork-like send up tosurvival amidst emotional despair. \\"My family tree's losing all its leaves\\" Chassagne laments, before realizing that she has been \\"learning to drive my whole life.\\" <br />
B000002LLC|4.0|This album by Madonna features \\"Music from and inspired by the film [[ASIN:B00005T7I1 Dick Tracy]]\\".  It is not the actual Dick Tracy [[ASIN:B000008F1H soundtrack]], which is a different album featuring the likes of k.d. lang, Jerry Lee Lewis, Brenda Lee and Ice-T (but not Madonna).  Madonna's album has a few songs that were in the movie (the ones that were written by Stephen Sondheim), and other songs that were \\"inspired\\" by the film.  The \\"inspiration\\" mostly means that the songs are kinda sorta done in a 1930s style, although a few of the songs have lyrics that relate to the film.  Of course, the biggest hit from this album, \\"Vogue\\", is completely contemporary in feel, although the lyrics include a list of old time movie stars.  The other hit from this album, \\"Hanky Panky\\", is an ode to the joy of spanking.  Overall this is a fun album, although it's not one of Madonna's most important albums.  Serious Madonna fans will want to get it, but casual fans may want to get her other albums before this one.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|There are very few artist that could appeal to the masses, but is safe to say that Shania Twain is one of them.  From kids to seniors, Shania always play it safe to the ear and hearts.  And for the treats of many of hard core fans comes the collection of hits in one single cd(truly appreciated), as many would say there are some singles that were missed, but truly not the essentials.  The song that truly inspired from miss Twain are here.  The simple thing is that Twain and her husband knew how to blend pop-rock-country & ac in one song.  This greatest hits package include the country mix of the songs, a very nice touch in some songs that simply variated in a wrong way in the mix, like the UP remix version, wich was kind of anoying.  But here are some melancolic strong songs that just clame their place in the history of music like YOU'RE STILL THE ONE, the classic TWAIN song, and her most memorable.  FROM THIS MOMENT ON still holds that strong love feelin', MAN I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN it's a funky beat song, with an female freedom theme. I'M GONNA GETCHA GOOD one of the best rock-a-billie songs of TWAIN a very strong song, one of her best.  FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS, a very AC song, sweet and simple. UP uplifting, but a lil' repetitive.  COME ON OVER pure country. LOVE GETS ME EVERYTIME  a nice lyrics one, a very danceable. DON'T BE STUPID, the violins are hot, her voice great, THAT DON'T IMPRESS ME MUCH although I never thought this was one of her best, I must say the words are really funny(but easy laughs ones), ANY MAN OF MINE still her most country one.  And many more songs in this cd, the one thing you can say, is that the new single is weak, the collection is HOT, and Shania Twain is a big female ICON in the history of music.
B00005JKN9|1.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" is almost pointless. Oh sure, there's something about xenophobia and the shabby treatment of Catholic immigrants in mid-19th-century New York, but this point is never developed. Actually, nothing much is developed in this movie. Characters and situations are introduced, then dropped altogether or forgotten about for long stretches before being awkwardly dragged in again.     The main story is so old and stale I couldn't believe Scorsese would stoop to using it: Young boy sees father murdered, comes back years later to avenge him, infiltrates murderer's circle, begins to waver, gosh will the young avenger ever carry out his plan? Unless you have some really original twist to put on this hoary old plot, you had best stay miles away from it. Sad to say, Scorsese and his scriptwriters have absolutely nothing original in mind. It's just a dull, ineffective framing device for the movie.     Then there's the totally anachronistic feel to the movie, starting from the very first scene. A big gang fight is staged like a scene from Mad Max full of garishly got-up freaks and scored to a hard-rock electric guitar soundtrack. There are the token black members of the Irish gang (yeah right, I'm sure that's historically accurate). The absolute nadir, though, was the depiction of the notorious New York City Draft Riots as some kind of glorious uprising of oppressed peoples against their racist oppressors, when in fact it was a vast lynching rampage in which pro-Confederate whites murdered dozens of black Americans. In the midst of this riot, we get a rather anti-climactic \\"duel\\" between hero and villain.     Not since \\"Titanic\\" have I seen so much money and effort poured into such a lame, trite, ridiculous story. (Funny that they both starred this DiCaprio kid, who's also in Scorsese's latest snoozer. Are they lovers or something?) I don't know what has happened to Scorsese. He was once one of our brightest cinematic hopes. Maybe he's just going through a slump and will pull out of it soon. But after seeing \\"The Aviator\\" this weekend, I fear he may be in permanent decline.
0156907399|5.0|Virginia Woolf's lovely, poignant novel based on her own family is one of the great novels of the twentieth century. Basing the novel's central character of Mrs. Ramsay on her mother and Mr. Ramsay on her father, the well known philosopher Leslie Stephen, Virgnia Woolf strove to recreate artistically the mysteries and vagaries of time. The novel is divided unevenly into two sections, both of them dealing with possible or actual trips to the lighthouse in the vicinity of the Isle of Skye where the Ramsay family has a house that they use on summer holidays. Rarely in English fiction has the inner dynamics of a family been laid so completely bare as in this.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable things about this book is the way Virginia Woolf so probingly explores the personalities of the individuals, though three stand out above all others, the aforementioned mother and father, and the unmarried amateur painter Lily Briscoe. By the end of the novel, we feel that we know all of these characters on the deepest possible level, and while the two women are sketched more lovingly, it is the father, Mr. Ramsay, who is etched in his essence. Brilliant, but with striking emotional and intellectual limitations, he is both the head of the family and its bane. It isn't that the author dislikes him, but she is acutely aware of his vices and virtues (in her own life, Virginia's father despaired over his wife's early death, creating an atmosphere of gloom over Virginia's teen-aged years). The two women are plumbed less deeply, but we come away from the novel having a sense of their worth.<br /><br />TO THE LIGHTHOUSE was revolutionary when it appeared as one of the first attempts to profit from many of the lessons to be taught English language fiction by the extraordinary work of Marcel Proust. Woolf had a love/hate relationship with Proust, on the one hand recognizing very early on that he was the great literary genius of the century (Joyce, on the other hand, the other titan of the century, she thought less highly of), but finding his work so brilliant as to paralyze her. She famously remarked that after reading Proust she felt incapable of writing anything. But the fact is that TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is in many ways a Proustian work. Like Proust and unlike almost no one prior in English literature (with the notable exception of Butler's THE WAY OF ALL FLESH), Woolf fictionalized her own life (she herself appears in the novel as the girl Cam) and produced a profound analysis of the nature of passed time. Also like Proust, she attempts to break down traditional narrative and present her story impressionistically rather than historically. While she may have felt that Proust kept her from writing, the fact is that she produced the first literary masterpiece following in the footsteps of Proust.<br /><br />But in the end, what makes this most remarkable is the rich detailing, the marvelous nuances, the lush delineations. This is a book to be read slowly and savored, much as one would read a long poem. Indeed, this comes very close to being at times prose poetry, such as the wonderful section \\"Time Passes,\\" that is sandwiched between the first section of the novel \\"The Window\\" and the final section \\"The Lighthouse.\\"<br /><br />After having confessed my love of this novel, I will add that I adore this book despite being less than overwhelmed by some of her other fiction. I love Woolf's nonfiction, but ORLANDO I sometimes regard as my least favorite work of fiction by a major writer. This novel, however, easily rates as one of my favorite twentieth century novels. I would urge anyone who has similarly found some of Woolf's other work unpalatable to give this one a try. I would be astounded if many will find it in any way less than brilliant.of the century, she thought less highly of), but finding his work so brilliant as to paralyze her.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta isn't just a band you listen to, it's a band you fall deep into.Frances the Mute could be considered the 2005's Dark Side of the Moon. It's nice to hear a new band maintain the 70's prog-rock spirit, and adding a new sound to it. Totally original. A real masterpiece. Just as you thought they couldn't get any better with their debut album, De-loused in the comatorium, they actually did.
B0007P3582|3.0|Aside from a couple of shining moments, you're crazy if you've ever thought 50 was lyrically that good. His success is mainly due to his style/swagger, stellar beats, and undeniable hooks. Not like I'm trying to take anything away from him, but if you're expecting a whole lot of solid rhymes, let alone ones that don't involve guns & sex, 50 never has nor will be the place to go. He hasn't changed a whole lot in two years, but is he still doing it as good as he has?     \\"In My Hood\\" gets the album off to a solid start, it's a typical 50 Cent hood song and has a great beat by C. Styles & Bang Out. Overall it's good, but it's nothing special (although the Saxophone part that closes the track is real nice). \\"This Is 50\\" has a pretty grimy beat, but 50's drawl at the end of every line seems all too formulaic, taking a page right out of \\"Blood Hound\\" from \\"Get Rich...\\". It could easily grow on the listener though. Lyrically 50 copies his previous effort again with \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" (aka \\"Many Men\\" Pt. II). That being said it's one of the better tracks on the album with Eminem's production being the perfect marriage for the 50's subject matter.   \\"Piggy Bank\\" is Massacre's diss track, where the clunky beat won't really draw you in as much as the venom he spits at Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne, & Nas. To be honest this is not a big winner, the beat's not really that great but the big thing is while he disses these rappers he doesn't really say anything remotely harmful/embarrassing/clever/whatever. All this track is gonna do is make enemies & create some buzz, but he didn't have a single diss line that was memorable at all. This is a soft diss track at best, sorry no memorable \\"Back Down\\" on here.     Em produces and drops a verse for the great concept track \\"Gatman & Robbin\\". Both Mcs fit the quick paced beat quite well, Em's verse in particular will take several listens to break down.  Say what you want about the `hit' \\"Candy Shop\\", but the Scott Storch beat is simply hypnotizing and will be in the clubs for a long time. The subject matter gets a bit old (it's basically \\"Magic Stick\\" Pt. II), but the masses aren't even gonna listen to the lyrics anyway.     There is one serious problem you can see from reading the liner notes. While his previous effort was driven by four incredible Dr. Dre cuts, the producer's presence is greatly missed here as he only contributes two tracks. A Dre beat tends to bring out the best in 50, it did on \\"Get Rich\\" and the same holds true here. \\"Outta Control\\" is another classic shoulda-been Detox track and 50's hook comes off incredibly well, as it matches the high-pitched organs in the background. The strings and thumping bass in the background only add more intensity. While 50's verses aren't nearly as catchy as the hook, they certainly don't take away from this stellar track.     For \\"Get In My Car\\" Hi-Tek used a slight G-funk sound too it, and accompanies typical 50 pimping rhymes. The hook definitely has the potential to be used by every guy by the end of the summer. Disco D provides the stellar beat for \\"Ski Mask Way\\" which sounds like the score from an old Blaxploitation film, with its creative use of an O'Jays sample. This proves to one of the best tracks on here, and 50's Kool G Rap robbin' style rhymes works better than almost any other verse on the album. It's only further complete with the great hook that's doesn't have a hint of radio play in it. \\"Ski Mask Way\\" is definitely 50 at his best and most respectable.     50 actually shows some creativity on the concept \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\". While it's not a new concept to compare Drugs with Love, 50 pulls it off quite well (to spell it out for you, he's rapping as if he were heroin). Plus it's such a huge change of pace for him it's almost a shock at first. \\"Ryder Music\\", while not bad, just sounds completely uninspired. It's pretty much just lazy filler, and it doesn't even fit the title very well.     Dre somehow does not produce \\"Disco Inferno\\", instead again it's C. Styles & Bang Out. The beat and 50's hook really make this song. It's already a club hit and you either love it or hate it. Unlike that track, you can tell from the opening seconds that \\"Just A Lil Bit\\" is a typical Scott Storch production. 50 kicks some seductive rhymes (all too similar to \\"Candy Shop\\") to fit.     The final Dre track only makes you want more from the two. \\"Gunz Come Out\\", which is your less than typical Dre track, is just that dark hard-thumping gun-talk track that worked so well for \\"Heat\\". Slow horns play throughout that sound like a processional march and pounding pianos come in to compliment it. Overall it's another classic Dre & 50 track, but kinda unsatisfying knowing this is the only other spot from Dre. More of the same gun talk, comes from the high energy \\"My Toy Soldier\\" that you can't help but compare to \\"My Buddy\\" from the G-Unit album. Tony Yayo drops the all to frequent quick verse at the end of the track.     \\"Position of Power\\" has a pretty nice piano loop, although the hook is not the best. 50's typical lyrics fit nicely with the beat and are slightly more light hearted (more of a hustler song).     The album, which was carrying along pretty well, has a lot of faults towards the end.     The Scott Storch \\"Build You Up\\" has a pretty nice beat, but the Thug Luv type track is defiantly gonna be another love it or hate it track. Jamie Foxx's chorus isn't nearly as memorable as the one for \\"Slow Jams\\", it basically could have been sung by any typical R&B singer.   \\"God Gave Me Style\\" is pretty forgettable, though some might argue his cheesy lyrics here show \\"depth\\" or whatever... I'm not buying it.  \\"So Amazing\\" is SO much like a Ja Rule/Ashanti track it's sick. How could 50 possible put this song after he ripped JA for releasing this same garbage? This track is a huge disappointment, I'm not sure at all what he was thinking (nor how could Dre or Em let him put this out.)     If that wasn't bad enough,the \\"I Don't Need Em\\" COMPLETELY jacks Ghostface's \\"Metal Lungies\\" on the Pretty Toney Album. Did he think that no one would notice?? I cannot believe 50 did this, considering Ghostface's album wasn't even released more than a year ago. This really leaves the album off on a sour note for a real rap fan.     Both regular & collector's editions have the 'bonus' track \\"Hate It Or Love it (Remix)\\". The original is a great song and both the Game and 50 brought some great lyrics. Here, both 50's verses are the same, the Game's first verse is different (and actually better), the rest of G-Unit adds on a small verse, but they really sound out of place. They don't work well on the track, making this Bonus not very rewarding.     Before concluding the review of the album - despite the fact it doesn't cost much more, THE COLLECTORS EDITION IS NOT ANY BETTER. You're better off saving the $5 bucks or so and skipping the nude photos included (which is really the only difference i can see).    As good as this album can be at times, it equally falls flat in other areas. The album is just too long (1 hour and 17 min!), especially when it has more than it's fair share of duds. The Massacre would get some serious help if it was a bit more picky with the track selection, in paticular towards the end.  Fans can expect the same from 50 lyrically for the most part, which is either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Another slight problem is you almost can't help but compare a lot of the tracks from \\"Massacre\\" to 50 or G-Unit's previous work, because they just sound like they fit the same formula all too well.     Bottom Line: There's plenty of material on here that is good quality (from 50 Cent standards) and fans will end up loving the album because of this. Despite the fact that there are way too many weak tracks, the strengths will satisfy just as they did on \\"Get Rich\\", and \\"Massacre\\" will probably go at least 4x Platinum. This album as a whole is merely ok, because the good and bad balance out pretty evenly, but even knowing ahead of time won't stop anybody from picking up \\"The Massacre\\".
B00005JMAH|5.0|Hummm..the third delivery of the Potter saga, it's out of this world, the coolest thing that happen in the movie are, well Harry Potter is mad, he's not taking it anymore, Hermayoni? and Ron are getting in love, Hermayoli? got a cool time travel device, and this movie is very dramatic but without falling in truly odd moments like the second one.  Directed by Cuarn(The Little Princess) the vistosity of the movie is higher and the euro feelin' is more established, although there are some different outlets like Hagrid shack, but still the movie is a *****FIVE STARS, the story, the film and the acting are top, the kid who makes Harry finally can really act.
B0007O38F8|3.0|At fisrt, I was pretty pumped to get the album (regardless of \\"Disco Inferno\\" and \\"Candy Shop\\"; those are way overplayed by the radio). Well, I got the Collector's Edition, which is $2 more for a nice lil' cover and a few extra photos. The package is nice and all... but, the CD itself falls short of my and probably many of you other 50 fans. Tracks like \\"In My Hood\\", \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\", \\"Gunz Come Out\\", and a few others were pretty good. The others are just a bunch of fillers. I don't really get why there are so many diss tracks. Dissin' Nas and a few others; Nas is so much better than you.  Compared to Get Rich or Die Tryin', The Massacre isn't all that great. Get Rich had a bunch of real hardcore tracks that were at least 4 minutes; Massacre is filled with a ton of tracks that are around the 3 minute mark and they aren't all that good.  50, much respect to you, but you should've gone with quality rather than quantity. Overall, the CD is alright; could be so much better, but we'll see if 50 has a comeback in the future.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I had been waiting for about 10 months for this album to come out and finally got my hands on the Japanese version around Feb 10th so I've been listening to Frances the Mute for almost a month.   <br /> <br />This album is nearly flawless.  It isn't as consistent with the intensity as Deloused was but when the whole band is actually playing it is absolutely amazing.  The band has gotten much tighter since Deloused and the production is much better (Deloused always sounded muffled).   <br /> <br />Some notable changes within the band is that Cedric has officially become a rock GOD.  He is absolutely breath-taking on this album.  He consistently hits killer high notes which are never painful to your ears.  He also whispers in an extremely tormented voice, yelps, makes some of the strangest vocal effects I've ever heard and even slurps at one point of the album (it sounds really cool).  Also the addition of Juan (bassist) adds a lot to the band...especially since the bass on Deloused was so quiet...now you can finally hear the deep bass lines behind Omar's insane guitar playing.  The rest of the band is also amazing...Jon never stops pounding away at the drums and Ikey is The Man on the keyboards.  I can't really talk about the newest member, Marcel, because I'm not sure if I heard him really. <br /> <br />I would try to describe the sound of The Mars Volta but unless you have heard them before it's kind of hard.  If you have then I can tell you that Frances the Mute sounds a lot like their live shows (which can be heard on thecomatorium.com).  Frances the Mute is a lot more spacey than Deloused...it will kick you in the face for minutes straight and then slow down for a couple minutes before coming back in full force.   <br /> <br />Cygnus sounds like a psychedelic-funk-punk-progsplosion.  The Widow is a slower ballad which is the only really bad song on the album...well, it's not really that bad but is nothing compared to the other songs.  L'Via is an incredibly addictive song sung half in spanish.  Miranda is a slower ambient song which finishes strong and has a catchy metal chorus.  And Cassandra is a 32 minute tour de force which knocks you down right at the beginning and doesn't let you up to breathe once.  It only has about 5 minutes which I think could have been cut out...but that's not bad considering it's over half an hour long. <br /> <br />All in all I would give this album around a 4.75 because it isn't as easy to listen to as Deloused was (which is why I think some people don't like it).  It has slow-downs at the end of almost every song which kind of takes away from the excitement.  If they had just cut about 15 minutes off of the album it'd be, quite possibly, the best release in decades.  But paying $7.00 for 60+ minutes of music is a fantastic deal.  And those 60+ minutes are absolutely mind-blowing...pure adrenaline combined with one of the best voices in music, some of the strangest sounding guitar effects, haitian-trained voodoo drumming provided by one of the best drummers around, sweet keyboards and killer bass lines. <br /> <br />If you like any music that strays away from the ordinary then definitely give this album a shot because it really does grow on you and is incredibly interesting...it's a must-hear for everyone. <br /> <br />and by the way...all of the sound clips and song titles are mixed up so don't go by them.

In the second the candidate was kidnapped.  The main characters are the agents who provided the protection for the candidates.  Sean King was next to presidential candidate Ritter when he was killed.  Joan Dillinger was also on the scene.  Michelle Maxwell was the agent in charge when candidate Bruno was kidnapped.

The latter part seemed to add confusion rather than contributing a lot to the story. I probably would have given a four or five star rating if the author had seen fit to wrap up the story about one-hundred pages earlier. <br /> <br />Overall though, it was an interesting book to read with much mystery and interesting characters. <br />
B0000VCT7Q|5.0|I heard a song on the radio that I liked, and I thought the announcer said it was called &quot;Air&quot; by Mike Mills.  When I went online to buy it, I discovered the SONG was &quot;Mike Mills&quot; by a group called Air, who turned out to be two French guys who record in Paris, but sing in French-accented English.  <br />When I started listening to it, I fully expected that the only track I would like would be the one I had heard on the radio (which is what usually happens!) -- but imagine my delight in discovering that, not only is the whole recording a treasure, but there are several songs on it I had heard before and loved but hadn't known who the artist was.<br />There's the odd song like &quot;Cruising on a Rocket&quot; that is up-tempo, but most of the tracks are beautifully hypnotic.  Their gentle voices combine with the floating, ethereal melodies to create an effect that is incredibly soothing and peaceful.  After a stressful day, I just put it on, and tracks like &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; and &quot;Universal Traveller&quot; make all the cares of the world melt away.
B0007O38F8|3.0|To each its own with this latest cd.  Get Rich or Die Trying was an instant classic, you could listen to the whole cd through without skipping a song.  The Massacre on the other hand has a handful of songs that I didn't care for so I skipped the track.  The cd is cool, but the hype killed it, and 50 put too much pressure on himself to create another masterpiece.  The bad thing is this fell just a little short of a masterpiece.  50's still the hottest rapper out though.   <br />CHECK OUT T.I. cd URBAN LEGENDS!!!!!!!!!!
0743454529|1.0|I picked up this book because of all the buzz surrounding it, and the premise actually sounded compelling.  This was the first Piccoult book I had read so I had nothing to compare it to. <br /> <br />Here are the main flaws:   <br /> <br />1) The characters are completely cliched, everyone from the rebellious son, to the cold-hearted lawyer's bimbo secretary.  Then if that's not bad enough, several of the characters have complete personality turns mid-stream to tie everything up neatly at the end.   <br /> <br />2) The writing itself leaves a lot to be desired.  There was little originality.  Everything felt pre-written or rehashed.  Worse was her constant need to hit the reader over the head with her \\"main moral point\\" of a particular chapter.  Banal stuff like: \\"Sometimes life is hard.\\"  Okay, so maybe not that bad, but she certainly doesn't give her readers any credit for their abilities to infer themes/symbols etc.  She just whacks you over the head with it. <br /> <br />3) The Ending.  Obviously I won't give it away, but I agree with the other readers that she completely builds the story up to a point and then doesn't have the nerve to bring it to a hard decision.   <br /> <br />I just don't like books like this. The book feels pale and lifeless and devoid of life, or spark, or something that makes a book really compelling. <br /> <br />It does, however, raise an interesting moral question.  But I believe it's raised on the back cover.  So my suggestion to you is: Read the back of the book and call it a day.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|1.0|Take a typical hip hop CD with typical cuts <br />Add a song about Jesus <br />This invites those who listen to Christian music to get this otherwise secular CD <br />Sell millions of copies <br />Kayne bends over and takes it to the bank, laughing all the way. <br /> <br />Kayne is a genius who otherwise has released a pretty standard hip hop and rap album. By adding a song about God, he figured out a way to add many new fans and consumers. Way to go Kayne, I still find you to be a smug, arrogant performer who throws hissy fits and temper tantrums, but good move to milk this album for the most money possible.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Many have attempted to tackle the cliche topic of addiction on film. Many valiant attempts have been made. Yet somehow no other film has ever hit me so hard. I witnessed this incredible movie at the theater, and when it ended an uncomfortable, unforgettable aura and silence lurked in the theater. All those in attendence were blown away and unable to even move immediately after. I was paralyzed, trying to grasp what I just witnessed. This is a heart breaking, wonderful, and TRUE movie. To lump this in with other drugs films is to belittle it. Sheerly from a cinematic stand point this movie is amazing. The cinematography is truly gripping. I love how this movie spirals down with increasing intensity like a runaway locomotive. Aronofsky is a true visionary. This movie was not suppossed to make you feel good. I am glad there are not more movies of this nature. This film should be seriously shown to all high school kids so they can obtain a realistic perspective on the spector of drugs. This amazing film was not just about drugs. It was about dreams and the fragile nature of humans. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie. Support those who make bold and daring art.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Like many Clash fans, I too made a tape in the 80's, editing out the irritating tracks. I have been going through a major Clash / Mescaleros thing in the last six months and decided to repeat the exercise on CD. Following are the tracks that made it on to my very enjoyable Sandinista- Edited! disc:<br /><br />Magnificent Seven, Hitsville U.K., Junco Partner, Ivan Meets G.I. Joe, Leader, Somebody Got Murdered, One More Time, Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice), If Music Could Talk, Sound of Sinners, Police on My Back, Call Up, Washington Bullets, Charlie Don't Surf<br /><br />Two Caveats:<br /><br />I filled out this disc with bonus tracks: Live versions of Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice) and Magnificent Seven from the box set and the This Is Radio Clash single plus Torchlight from the Ellen Foley record because they were from this era.<br /><br />I perhaps should have included Broadway, Corner Soul and Street Parade. Not because I particularly like them but because the Clash was performing these songs live at the time.<br /><br />Lastly: Is One More Time the most underrated Clash song of all time or what?
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Wow, I'm not really sure how to start a proper review on this album. Most of you checking this out already know that the Mars Volta the project taken on by former At the Drive-In members Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez. You probably also know that they brought their vision of fusing prog, metal, Latin, free-jazz, and almost every other genre together in their critically acclaimed debut album, De-Loused in the Comatorium. <br /> <br />I strongly agree with other reviewers who have warned that is album is little to nothing like De-Loused. In fact, at times it sounds like a completely different band, more akin to the likes of Boredoms or even the insane Mr Bungle. <br /> <br />One of the big differences between the two albums are the song structures. Yes, De-Loused did have a couple marathon songs, most notably the 12-minute \\"Cicatriz ESP\\", but what Omar has written here is one 78-minute track, divided into 5 pseudo-distinct \\"suites\\". What this does is force the listener to try and wrap their minds around almost an hour and a half of music, which is next to impossible, even for the most eclectic listeners. This also means that more than just a couple of listens are required to understand how truly monumental this is as an album, hence the reason you see so many 1 or 2 star reviews on the first day. <br /> <br />Finally, and most importantly, it forces this album to become a \\"love or hate\\" kind of thing. It's impossible to simply think of this album as \\"okay\\" if you actually listen to the entire thing; it's simply too diverse yet too well fused together to like some parts and not like others. And that's exactly what The Mars Volta wanted to accomplish here. This isn't for fans of the structure and boundaries (and catchiness) of modern music. <br /> <br />So having got all of that out of the way, let me say...this is the best guitar-playing I've heard on any album. Does it descend into wankery at points? Of course, but as previously mentioned, Omar views silence as a distraction, and TMV are huge fans of the fade-to-ambience-and-back-to-an-explosive-chorus method, so some sort of noise is needed to bridge the gap.  <br /> <br />A perfect example of this is the opening suite, entitled \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cyngus\\". It opens with acoustic strumming and Cedric's beautiful, yearning croon and then explodes into a tight-laced riff with some slamming keyboard notes and Cedric wailing in Spanish. After about 4 minutes, \\"Cygnus\\" descends and then rises from the ashes again, and with Cedric's cry of, \\"WHO DO YOU TRUST?\\", explodes with a killer baseline. <br /> <br />Omar, who produced this album, absolutely shines throughout the entire course. Bass player Juan Aldrete and drummer Jon Theodore (one of the most underrated drummers out there) have more prominent roles on the album as well. Check out Theodore's ridiculous solo on \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\", which also features Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante with a couple of unbelievable guitar solos. <br /> <br />Yes, this is a mess of sound. It's noisy the whole way through, and may frustrate you. But take heart, because everything will click when you hear \\"Cassandra Geminni\\". The only real similarity between this and De-Loused is that both albums require repeated listening in order for you to make a connection; this one, however, takes up more time and is a more demanding listen. But other than your time, money, and energy, The Mars Volta aren't asking much...they just want to bash your brains in and re-form them with innovative, balls-out rock.

She even advices you on what to buy in the way of cookware, a big boon to many a wedding list!<br /><br /> It is a touch evangelical, Delia is always prone to giving you advice like a stern School Marm (so it feels like something you have to do rather than might do!) and this is reflected in her slighty dry, bossy and occasionalyy dreary writing, think cooking with a St Trinian's Head mistress if you have never seen Delia on TV. But I have to hand it to her, if you follow her recipes to the letter YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG!<br /><br /> Just curtail the cookware shopping list or do as she says and get a MUCH bigger Kitchen!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|the main thing you need to think about when listening to ftm is that all the tracks relate to one another and to the story that tmv is trying to convey. with that said, every little ambient nuance that many have complained about didn't bother me as i knew it had some sort of reason. and i'm not trying to go in deeper and find the literal meaning, but in the grand scheme of things, the whole album seems very important and every second seems worth listening to because i know it has some sort of meaning in the end

B0006Z2LH4|4.0|The title of my review really sums it up. This is the \\"Cube\\" (1997) sequel you wanted instead of getting \\"HyperCube\\" (2003). We saw the inside of the Cube throughout the whole first film. After watching the original didn't you want to know more about the cube? Who's on the outside doing all of this? Yes, sometimes it's best not to touch the unknown in some films, but that obviously was the mistake that HyperCube made by just giving us more inside the cube and a very vague ending outside the cube.<br /><br />Cube Zero not only gives us the in Cube action that we liked so much in the original... but it also answers those questions about what the cube is and who's on the outside looking in... or are they?
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Watching MTV, I saw the video for The Widow playing, while the TV was on mute...as it often is when MTV is on... But I saw the creativity in the vid and thought, I must hear this song... and that is indeed the way I feel about it, I must hear more! I am pleased with what I have heard from them. I tend to like non-mainstream music, the stuff that no one else is listening to, but I am aware that if MTV is playing it, all the \\"cool kids\\" will be listening to it too! OH well, I am not a cool kid I am a grown folk and I like this music, its very artistic and makes me think of a \\"gumbo\\"; has everything in it with a lot of flavor, a bit of spice and some surprises. I must say, that for ONE second...only one, when I heard the voice, I thought that there was some \\"unrealesed\\" Zepp flying around out there. Rock on Guys! Sounds GREAT!
B0007TKNL0|1.0|As an avid theatre-goer, I have seen many musicals throughout my life.  The first musical I ever saw was \\"Phantom of the Opera\\".  So I became enthralled when the movie was to be coming out.  However, to my disappointment, the movie is lost in the visual spectacle that isn't even all the great to begin with.  Why Lloyd Weber chose Schumacher as the director for this film is beyond my reasoning.  Did he see \\"Batman Forever\\"?  Honestly, the entire movie lacks the emotional power of the stage production, as well as the talent.  The voices are bad, the acting is horrific, and the overall structure is slow moving and robotic.  The actors knew nothing about musical performance.  This is why I give this movie such a bad rating.
B000035P7X|5.0|I last saw Don't Look Back when I was a kid. I've always like Dyaln's music and his importance in changing pop culture. 35 years had gone by since I saw the film. I bought the film on a weekend whim, figuring it would be entertaining, and perhaps a bit nostalgic. <br /> <br />The film is far more than just a candid, grainy black and white behind the scenes chronicle of Dylan's last acoustic tour in 1965. It was the birth of cinema verite. Don Pennebaker spoke at a film class I was in several years after the film came out, and described how he had a devised a system that used the quartz movements of the Acutron watches (one of the world's first electric watch movements) which were accurate to 1 second a month, and used them to sync film and sound recording independent of each other. This meant that film and sound no longer needed to be tethered to each other via cable to provide synced sound with images; and *that* allowed the filmmakers to be far less obstrusive than documentarians had been to that point. Most of the people in the movie have little awareness that they are being filmed, let alone filmed for posterity, and the results are wonderfully candid. <br /> <br />But most striking is observing Dylan's maturation as an adult and cultural icon over the course of the film. On his arrival in England, he's a bit feckless and precious. Clever and immature. Under the wing of Joan Baez, who at that point must have thought that she might be invited to share the tour with her young protege. But it's soon clear that Dyaln is the hippest person in any room, his appeal and intellectual depth transcending his entourage and every situation he enters. By the time, later in the film, that he has the famous encounter with Terry Ellis (the Science Student) and the man from Time magazine, he's a different person from the first scenes. Baez has disappeared with no explanation. Albert Grossman has moved to the background, after his great confrontation with the hotel manager earlierin the film. The Dylan at the end of the movie is sharper, more acerbic, and looks older... and it's just a few weeks later. Somewhere during this tour Dylan eschewed his folky roots (as seen in archival footage of him singing Pawn in the Game early in the film) and explodes as a genuine pop star... the man everyone wanted to be. Amazing. <br /> <br />Just as amazing is that when this film was made in 1965, Bob Dylan already had a substantive body of work, and had just turned electric (there's an early scene in the hotel listening to a test pressing of Maggie's Farm). He was just becoming the rock star Dylan that caused so much controversey at the time. And here it is 40 years and 30 albums later, and he's *still* discussed almost as much as he was then. I can't think of any other entertainer whose career has been as relevant for as long a time as he has. Amazing... <br /> <br />This film is a must for anyone who wants to understand how our music and culture took a sharp turn many years ago. Pennebaker's methods were a revolution in film making that caught a revolution in the making. Great stuff.

0786852550|5.0|This book was given me as a present (often the best way I discover new authors.)  I finished it in a span of days, despite a busy schedule.  The djinni Bartimaeus is the unusual  character with a witty and sarcastic take on events who- this is important- isn't always correct in his interpretation of said events.  Too frequently authors use such characters to offer their own views or interject their own philosophical musings in a world of the authors' own creation, where they are, of course, correct.  Bartimaeus' view is enjoyable reading, but it is a testament to the author's skill that you don't become bored or irritated when the less powerful and far more mortal Nathaniel's point of view takes over.  The writing is clever, the plot moves quickly, and the characters are well drawn.  I will note that while there is little by way of language or sexuality in the book (aside from moments where Bartimaeus sneeringly tells his young summoner that he should take up an interest in girls or other, healthier subjects) there is some violence, including a few deaths, which might be disturbing to very young children.  Some parents might frown upon the demon-summoning themes inherent to the book, but then, some parents have their springs entirely too tightly wound.    P.S.  I can't resist mentioning that I interrupted reading Robert Jordan's 10th Wheel of Time book, _Crossroads of Twilight_, to read _Amulet_... And then interrupted it again to read _Amulet_ to my wife aloud.  Yes, this book is _that_ good, and Jordan's book is _that_ bad.  You can find my review of that here as well.

Hey 50, you kicked out da game for not having your back on your beef with fat joe, nas and jada...Jennifer Lopez did a single with joe! So she must be takin sides! You gonna diss her on your next cd? I'm sure that will give you some more street cred to diss jlo, I mean shes hard core! And your boy Eminem did a single with jada...wanna explain that one? The only reason he's popular is cause of the hype everyone makes about him, so what..he's from the streets, that doesn't make him a good rapper. 90% of rap sucks anyway, very few good rappers left. it's all POP rap now, it's sad. Candy shop...god that has to be the worst single this year! Don't buy this CD, you will regret it
B0007O38F8|1.0|First off let me start by saying that I am a 50 cent fan. Since \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" dropped I have been feverishly anticipating his next LP. However \\"The Massacre\\" is nothing what I expected. The beats are really the only thing keeping this CD from being the worst album of the year. The whole \\"diss err body and they momma\\" thang is played out and his ABC rhymes are worse than ever. I knew that 50's negative attitude toward other artists was kinda shady but I always thought that him being talented would give him clout to do so, but that is no longer the case. COME ON 50!!!
068987474X|2.0|When Greg Behrendt uttered the now-famous words \\"He's Just Not That Into You,\\" cash registered jingled in every bookstore in America.  Or they should have.  Behrendt was a \\"consultant\\" to \\"Sex in the City\\" where Liz Tuccillo was a writer, and Behrendt spoke the memorable phrase in a writers' meeting.  Since consultant and writer for \\"Sex in the City\\" are as good credentials as any for dating advisors, Behrendt and Tuccillo went ahead and did an advice book made up of variations on a theme: Eleven chapters that all start with \\"He's Just Not That Into You If...\\"  Really.  Talk about a one note symphony...<br /><br />Well, clearly, Behrendt and Tuccillo hit a nerve.  Or more precisely, Behrendt did with his off-the-cuff utterance.  It's likely the smartest thing he ever said -- certainly worth the most.  Behrendt looks like an over-baked surfer who took too many drugs.  But he does seem to have the male mind nailed down.  Or at least, some of the male minds.<br /><br />Behrendt and Tuccillo's theme is if a guy is \\"into\\" a woman, he'll pursue her, keep in close contact, want to have sex her, and essentially be on his very best behavior.  He will NOT not ask you out, not call, not date, not want to have sex, have sex with someone else, only want to see the woman when  he is drunk, not want to marry her, break up with her, disappear, be married, or be a jerk, a bully or a freak.<br /><br />OK, that's the book.  Now you know, and you don't have to buy it.<br /><br />P. S.  I also found the layout too cutesy for words.

6305511055|5.0|Every time I re-watch this movie I feel very sad and then very angry at the same time.  The reason being that many of the  location shots were taken in and around the World Trade Center.  Don't know about you but I haven't forgotten about that fateful September day as many seem to have.  That aside, if you think about it, this movie is ever so contemporary in its main plot.  Kind of makes you wonder what really is going on.  Thinking what Director Higgins said at the end of the movie regarding food, oil, etc., &#34;Don't ask people now, ask them then&#34;!  No politics here, just think with road rage and stupid attitudes of today along with the tremendous number of cars on the road: How would America deal with the gas shortages as with the mid 1970's oil embargo?  Food for thought.<br /><br />UPDATE! 10.12.06<br /><br />Well, I got my answer.  The summer of 2006, everybody just paid the $3 bucks a gallon and went about business as usual.  But then again the long lines from the 70's never appeared either.<br /><br />UPDATE! 03.26.08<br /><br />Well, here it is two years later and gas is OVER $3 bucks a gallon heading towards $4.00 making this movie more contemporary every minute! (IMHO)<br /><br />UPDATE!  08.08.08<br /><br />Well, gas did make it to over $4.00 a gallon.  Down a bit but it could go up in a heartbeat.  Wouldn't you just love to see this movie back on the big screen?  It would make a mighty pertinent statement in this election year.<br /><br />UPDATE! 01.25.16<br /><br />Gas at less than $1.50 a gallon.  What a weird economy and another election year here in 2016...
B0006U4UAU|1.0|I checked out the samples from napster, amazon, wal-mart.com.  (amazon loaded fastest)  And I have to say...this is pure unadulterated crap.

But the main difference between those pieces of trash and this piece of trash is that none of those had a bald white guy with a sinus infection spitting a whining monotone over what sounds like someone beating the crap out of a '72 ford pinto to express his dissatisfaction with modern music.   <br />

B000009DUY|5.0|John Williams' score for Saving Private Ryan is different from most war films.  Yes there is action and the music reflects that, however most of the cd is filled with understated music that makes a powerful impact on the listener.  Perhaps the most enjoyable tracks are the first and last called Hymn to the Fallen, which is a touching memorial to those who died both during D-Day & during World War II. It is these two tracks that are the most memorable on this cd.  Overall, I have to say that I found this cd to be totally enjoyable and a touching tribute to both the fallen and the survivors.
0380789019|4.0|Mr. Gaiman writes in a genre all his own (though I did read a story about the Rat King and his son saving the world from the Pied Piper, which is sort of along the lines  Mr. Gaiman writes).  This is a story of London underground and the lost people who live there.  The interesting part is that the hero is some ordinary bloke, who does not act like a hero, or trys to be a hero, but the essence of heroism is that he is there and is true to his people.

B000696RIY|5.0|The bestselling artist in the 21st century Britney Spears summarizes with this collection first six years of her outstanding career and shows her story from teenage sensation to icon of pop-culture. She started with simple catchy pop songs which were written for her just to be hits, but in the 21st century she was converted to less commercial r'n'b and club music instead of selling incredible amount of records and above all she began to write her own songs. This album is a certificate of evolution from manufactured teen idol to professional artist.    Spears has as many fans as anti-fans, so there are varied opinions about her music. But we must to admit that facts are on Spears' side, because her music achieved not only commercial success with 60 million sold albums and almost twenty hits all over the world, but above all artistic with numerous nominations to the most prestigious music awards including Grammy. And no words can take it back from her. It's simply high quality pop music, that's all. Isn't it ridiculous that such innocent music causes so much anger or even hate in some people? Thanks to this strange mystery these people make Spears' music uncommon in some way.    Spears with all these hits took over the throne from Queen of Pop Madonna and Queen of R'n'B Janet Jackson. That's why she sold much more records during her career than Madonna and Janet put together in the same period of time! And such hits like: \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\", \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" or \\"Toxic\\" are classics in history of pop music already.     This is the best, because the most expanded edition of this set. That's why in this version it's a perfect compilation. It contains 20 songs - all Britney's 17 international hits and 3 brand new songs as well. In this special edition you can also find a bonus CD with 6 very interesting remixes and \\"Megamix\\" of her biggest hits.    And it's only beginning...
B000004286|5.0|I have written many reviews over the last several years, and very few have been kind to him.  In the case of Braveheart, James Horner writes a triumphand and beautiful score.  It is among his most original and deserved an Oscar.  Full of Scottish and Irish pipes as well as a touching love theme along with a powerful main theme, Horner's Braveheart is among the best score's of the last twenty years.  It is significant that Horner's Oscar winning Titanic score sounds very similar to Braveheart, and that since Braveheart his music has become less and less original.  I believe that Braveheart marks the pinnacle of his career, despite Titanic's Academy Award win for best original score.
0380789035|4.0|Mr. Gaiman is a really good writer.  This is one that is hard to put aside.  Starting from the introduction of the hero in prison, to the end, you feel that this could happen.  The oddest part of the story is that when you reflect on the happenings, you feel that to describe them a person would be thought insane, these things can not happen in real life, yet, in the story, it is very real and possible.<br /> It may be trite, but his reference to Greek girls is funny.  (Who does he hang out with that he heard this?  I did not hear this until I was 45 or so.)  The little poke at modern pagans is truly interesting.  I really got a jolt when he had a bit in there about a genie who was not like the one in 'Aladdin'.  I wrote a story in that genre, but, alas, he beat me to the publisher.  The ending is rather unusual and a surprise.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What more is there to say? The combination of scripts, production, direction, cast, and FX are the best I've ever seen on a TV series. Not just fans of Joss or sci-fi but anyone with an eye for quality should love this show.
B00065DWCW|5.0|The bestselling artist in the 21st century Britney Spears summarizes with this collection first six years of her outstanding career and shows her story from teenage sensation to icon of pop-culture. She started with simple catchy pop songs which were written for her just to be hits, but in the 21st century she was converted to less commercial r'n'b and club music instead of selling incredible amount of records and above all she began to write her own songs. This album is a certificate of evolution from manufactured teen idol to professional artist.    Spears has as many fans as anti-fans, so there are varied opinions about her music. But we must to admit that facts are on Spears' side, because her music achieved not only commercial success with 60 million sold albums and almost twenty hits all over the world, but above all artistic with numerous nominations to the most prestigious music awards including Grammy. And no words can take it back from her. It's simply high quality pop music, that's all. Isn't it ridiculous that such innocent music causes so much anger or even hate in some people? Thanks to this strange mystery these people make Spears' music uncommon in some way.    Spears with all these hits took over the throne from Queen of Pop Madonna and Queen of R'n'B Janet Jackson. That's why she sold much more records during her career than Madonna and Janet put together in the same period of time! And such hits like: \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\", \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" or \\"Toxic\\" are classics in history of pop music already.     This is the best, because the most expanded edition of this set. That's why in this version it's a perfect compilation. It contains 20 songs - all Britney's 17 international hits and 3 brand new songs as well. You can also choose its special edition with bonus CD containing 6 very interesting remixes and \\"Megamix\\" of her biggest hits.    And it's only beginning...
0804106304|5.0|Why 'Joy Luck' Brings Me Misery <br />©2001 Julia Oh <br /> <br />China doll. Meek, submissive, mysterious and sultry. White man's geisha. She shrieks at the sight of a mouse. She takes insults as a reminder to improve upon her flawed self. She is the survivor of abuse by Asian men from her past, just as she watched her mother abused by the hands of her father. She endures. She sits quietly alone, waiting for her white knight to come untie her from generations of misery. Who is she?  <br /> <br />The answer is simple. She is a creation. She is a fantasy Asian woman crafted by the minds of White men and bought without question by Asian women. <br />Be Real <br />I am a real Asian woman. I don't see myself fitting the synthetic mold by any stretch of the imagination. Fortunately, I am able to separate myself from this Asian female persona, as I am aware that she is a third-party creation, an amalgamation of laughable stereotypes. My life, while filled with many goals and driven by a multitude of ambitions, has undeniably been shaped by my constant battle with fighting racism and stereotypes. As my life experiences have taught me, many people mistake the myths about Asian women for reality. I realize, however, that those who hold misconceptions about Asians cannot be placed entirely at fault. Asian Americans currently comprise only 4% of the total US population. Therefore, those who have little to no daily contact with Asian Americans have only the media and second-hand accounts to rely on for their images and perceptions of Asian Americans.  <br /> <br />The disturbing element in all of this is the flagrant inaccuracies attached to the media-constructed image of the Asian American woman. And the consequence that I suffer due to this is that I am viewed as an aberration from the supposed \\"norm\\". I am an aberration because I speak my mind. I am an aberration because I assert my preferences. I am an aberration because I choose to date Asian males exclusively.  <br /> <br />In thinking of ways in which to combat stereotypes, I came upon the following conclusion: If people who have little to no contact with Asians continue to rely on the media as their source of information, then the media image should at least be a more accurate reflection of reality. It is with this determination that I came upon a certain idea.  <br />Campaign against Joy Luck Club <br />My campaign, or better put, my goal is simple: to either replace or supplement Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club from the reading lists of high schools and universities across the nation with works written by other Asian American authors who more accurately portray Asian Americans. JLC is currently used by institutions of learning across the nation, and is referenced as a novel that is \\"representative of the AA experience\\". Its recognition is so mainstream, in fact, that it comes along with study guides by Cliffs Notes. Furthermore, JLC holds the record for the highest gross sales for a novel written by an Asian American author, and even hit the silver screens in 1993, directed by Hollywood big shot Oliver Stone. Through Amy Tan and JLC, the images of self-loathing Asian women and abusive Asian men have reached the minds of thousands across the nation.  <br /> <br />In my campaign to replace JLC from school curriculums, I have enlisted the support of Asian American groups of every feasible nature. I am not looking to wipe out all works written by Asian American authors. Nor am I looking to censor Amy Tan. If academic institutions would even supplement their reading lists with other more representative works by Asian American authors in addition to JLC, I feel that many misconceptions that non-Asians hold about Asians could be clarified.  <br /> <br />My angst with JLC is that it plays upon all of the Asian stereotypes that were described in my opening paragraph. Asian women are depicted as lonely miserable characters whose ultimate salvation comes when united in marriage with a White male.Furthermore, the author mercilessly smears all of the Asian male characters, confining them to the role of the wife-abuser, or the nit-picking egomaniac. That a novel inclusive of such detrimental stereotypes is touted as the representative of the AA experience, that it is highly acclaimed by critics, and that the concerns regarding its portrayal of Asian Americans comes only from other Asian Americans is as puzzling to me as racism itself. When Amy Tan (who is, in real life, married to a White man) herself asserts that she would never date an Asian man because she would not date her father or her brother, how can anyone not question the impetus behind the fiction she creates? If a prominent White figure claimed that she would never date a white man because he would remind her of her brother, or even if a prominent Black figure claimed that she would never date a Black man because she would never date her father, the public would certainly question the mental well-being of the individual. But in Amy Tan's case, neither the personal comment nor the dynamics between Asian men and women in JLC are questioned. Could this be because the public believes that she represents the collective voice of Asian America? In such a \\"PC\\" country, certainly no one would dare object to the morale of an entire ethnic group.  <br />Who Are These Guys?  <br />In my countless correspondences with Asian Americans of every background, the overwhelming consensus is that the story is NOT representative of the Asian American experience. I must confess that there were parts to JLC that I could relate to, such as the generational and cultural gap the protagonist felt with her immigrant parents. But alongside these anecdotes came, what I felt, were flagrant generalizations. I especially never felt that abusiveness and arrogance were traits exclusive to Asian men. <br /> <br />So long as JLC and Amy Tan are the only widely recognized products of Asian American literature, the strife for equality of Asian Americans will continue to be stifled. The kung-fu evil master and the white male's sexual servant stereotypes will continue their reign as the foremost images attached to Asian Americans. And if the only contact that many non-Asians have with Asian Americans is through television or literature, we must, by all means, do our best to provide a clearer, more comprehensive and affirmative picture. <br /> <br />[...]
B00005JLD4|5.0|There can be little question that, were the shoe on the other foot --that is, if the government of the United States or England decided to take away the children of an entire demographic, say the children of southern whites or of people living in one of England's numerous rust belt ex-cities of the sort that seem to give ingrown rise to skinheads and white supremacists-- we would be reading some very different views from the racists on the topics explored in Rabbit Proof Fence. Can you imagine your neighbor's two kids being being carted away by the local sheriff without a fight? It wouldn't happen. Yet some people keep posting reviews that urge common, decent folk, like you and your neighbors, to support the sort of policy depicted by Rabbit Proof Fence. Incredible.    As bleak as Rabbit Proof Fence is at times, the story is, as many here have noted, really one of hope, of the triumph of the human spirit. It is a beautiful demonstration of resisting and overcoming gross social injustice. THAT'S the LESSON of this film. And besides being a great adventure trek story in it's own right, the film stands as a reminder: the only thing necessary for something like this to happen again -- to any race, any place, any moment-- is for the human capacity for empathy and seeing things FROM the other person's life-vantage to pass away without resistance. THAT'S why the voices of haters and racists deserve not censorship, but simply to be drowned out-- smothered completely-- by the voices of reasonable people who HAVEN'T lost their ability to empathise and identify and feel compassion for people who aren't exactly like them. To haters, empathy is a mystical process. They don't get it, and they hate it because it poses THE central threat to their ability to induct the disenfranchied and gullible into their intellectually and emotionally stunted army of the Got-It-All-Wrong.    This film is great, and the DVD contains some very fine supporting material,  in the form of the audio commentary and making-of documentary. It will make an absolutely superb addition to any  library or school DVD collection. Five stars+.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|So the new cd comes out, and of course they melted our faces off with true-to-form metal. How could I have thought otherwise? After all, they made a deal with the devil to rock this world of its axis. Me and my slutty girlfriend blast this cd while peeling out. Anyway, the only bad song is \\"Revolution\\". Why? Because the riff is the EXACT SAME RIFF FROM JANES ADDICTIONS MOUNTAIN SONG!! And the vocal phrasing is way too Manson-y, which doesnt work with stadium rock anthemic lyrics like \\"Revolution!\\". DONT RIP OFF THE PEOPLE WHO RIP YOU OFF, GUYS! Just smash metal into my eardrums. AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!! <br />I just skip over that track and basically am left with my new favorie Priest CD!!!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Simon Pegg plays Shaun who doesnt have a great life. He just got out of a relationship with Liz, played by Kate Ashfield and he lives with two roommates, one being his best buddy Ed, played by Nick Frost and the other roommate is an uptight ponce. Shaun doesnt know the world around him is changing and soon the people of the town are zombies walking eating the flesh from the humans. When Shaun realizes this, him and his buddy Ed race to go save his family and his girlfriend. Way better than expected and way hilarious....too much memorable parts, though one being the scene where Ed and Shaun chuck Vinyl records at a zombie in the back yard. Also starring Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Underworld '03, I Capture The Castle) as Shaun's step father. If you wanna laugh yourself to death, Shaun Of The Dead hits the bullseye. A bloody good time and hey...dont forget that cricket paddle. Cheers and enjoy.
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I didn't discover \\"MacGyver\\" until I was in junior high (around 1990) but loved it instantly.  The idea of a hero who got himself out of tight situations using only his tremendous smarts and the things around him (including the ever-handy Swiss Army Knife) always appealed to me, and the show was far more entertaining than most action shows on TV.  I wondered why it took so long for it to come out on DVD.  Though I like the later seasons a bit better-- some of the early episodes were pretty farfetched-- it was fun to see Season 1.  I'd forgotten half the great one-liners and stunts, and laughed really, really hard.  On a more serious note, I appreciated the wisdom that Mac offered sometimes, and also the message that violence never solves anything, and still love those aspects of the show.  I would agree, however, with the complaints cited by other reviewers: the picture and sound quality isn't the best, and I was really disappointed by the lack of extras.  It would have been a lot of fun to see interviews with the cast, and maybe some behind-the-scenes stuff, bloopers, outtakes, etc.  I hope Paramount does a little better with Season 2.
B0007O38F8|1.0|This album is terrible.  50 Cent feels that he can put out anything and it will sell.  There are no songs I can vibe to except \\"Hate It or Love It Remix.\\"  \\"Piggybank\\" is the worst diss song I have ever heard.  Please do not buy this album, the only reason I gave it one star is because that was the lowest I could go.
0596007124|4.0|I always hear the term of \\"design pattern\\" in programming books and magazines, e.g. factory pattern, singleton pattern. This takes my attention to know more about them. Therefore, I have looked for a book of \\"design pattern\\" for a long time. But most of them are boring and hard to understand as common computer books and web articles. Fortunately, I found this book. <br /> <br />The beautiful and funny book cover gives me a good first impression. After I got the book, woo~ what a thick and heavy book! I felt afraid because I guessed it would be full of text and I may need several months to complete it. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, boring is not the truth. With a lot of funny stuff (big font size, graphics, photos, hand writing stretches), exercises/games (crossword puzzles, match games), story like format, elaborate content, I couldn't stop to read. I am able to get a clear picture of each pattern in easy and interesting ways. It does not deeply explain the detail of each pattern, but gives you a well introduction to each pattern with sample codes. It is suitable to people who are getting start to learn about \\"design pattern\\".  <br /> <br />However, the thickness of the book brings inconvenience. I cannot put it in my briefcase, carry it on the way and read it in bus. I think it will be better if the size can be reduced. <br /> <br />In conclusion, the book is cool and smart. I will recommend it to my friends.
B0007O38F8|1.0|This album is the biggest dissapointment. Theres nothing new or unique, just plain old garbage with weak beats and poor lyrics.(two Dr. Dre beats...THAT'S IT!!! and the song with Eminem sucks ass!) This doesn't compare at all to GET RICH'. This isn't even worth downloading. It's pure crap!!! If you want to listen to real rap, listen to The Game, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Jay-z, Nas, or NWA, or anything but this crap. Im sorry to tell you this 50, but your time is up as a rapper. Just give up, it's over, go back to Queens and don't ever come back without all Dr. Dre beats.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This is hilarious movie, you all should take a revolver to your heads!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Hey, did you hear about the one-star reviewer who accidentally shot himself in the head? Although brain-damaged, he lived to write a review! Nyuk nyuk. Band of Brothers is obviously the best film work ever done about World War II. And there's a lot of good stuff out there: Charles Guggenheim's D-DAY REMEMBERED, Thomas Lennon's THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, THE LONGEST DAY, PATTON, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, and many, many more. In English language film (based on what I've seen--I've got to work and sleep, too, you know...), I can only think of Ken Burns' THE CIVIL WAR and Herbert Wise's I, CLAUDIUS, as being close in quality and ambition.

B00005JNNL|5.0|All the other reviews do such a great job at either describing the film itself or the essence of the film, so I won't get into that. All I want to say is that when the movie ended and the credits began to roll I felt incredibly good. Yes, it is a depressing movie, but at the same time it reinforces the idea that life is beautiful and those who are able to appreciate life should! I was silent for a while after the movie ended, only being able to think of this very fact.  <br />
B00000DCHD|5.0|Billy Joel's fifth album, \\"The Stranger\\" was a landmark album for the man known as \\"The Piano Man\\".   It established him as not only a critically acclaimed artist, but one that could be a major commercial selling one as well.   Top to bottom, \\"The Stranger\\" was as good an album as any in the 1970s.   The question would be whether or not Billy Joel could follow it up.   This question would soon be answered when Billy Joel's \\"52th Street\\" would be released.   Billy would use much of the formula that worked well on the \\"The Stranger\\" and produce a product that would be another legendary album. <br /> <br />I look at Billy Joel's career as having three phases.  The first phase is what I call \\"Old Billy Joel\\".    This basically includes all of his material from \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\" through \\"Turnstiles\\".   These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound, but they also contain most of Joel's least heard material.   The next phase is what I call \\"Middle Billy Joel\\".  This was his most successful period and covers from \\"The Stranger\\" to \\"Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2\\".  Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues.  The final phase is the \\"Later Billy Joel\\" phase - this covers \\"The Bridge\\" to \\"River of Dreams\\".  In this phase, Billy would start to incorporate some of his older styles of music while not abandoning his desire to continue to explore new avenues.  \\"52th Street\\" definitely is a Phase 2 album that continues Billy's desire to broaden things beyond just the piano. <br /> <br />On \\"The Stranger\\" Billy Joel incorporated two main themes:  1) An \\"Old New York\\" style of music that can best be described as a street-sounding jazz sound;  2) A Melting Pot Theme - a mix of various cultural themes (Latin, Italian, Viennese, etc).   From a musical standpoint, Billy provided a balance to his trademark piano playing with guitars and horns.    In a lot of ways, \\"52th Street\\" continues thesethemes - without any loss of quality.   Like its predecessor , Billy's \\"52th Street\\" will also provide the same high quality lyrics for the songs.  The big difference I find between the two albums is that many of the songs on \\"52th Street\\" don't get the attention like the ones from \\"The Stranger\\" got - and that just isn't fair. <br /> <br />Here is a review of each of the tracks: <br /> <br />\\"Big Shot\\": This is one of the better-known songs.   This has more of a guitar edge than a jazz sound, but it still has a \\"New York\\" sound to it.  There are some nice horns in it.    Billy provides almost an Italian-American/New York (\\"melting pot\\")  sound when mid-way through the song he sings \\"You had be a big shot, didn't you\\" with a heavy accent. <br /> <br />\\"Honesty\\":  This is a very powerful song that builds up as it goes along.   This is more of a piano based song and can easily fit into it.   The one thing that gets overlooked is some of the powerful percussion later in the song - especially some of the crashing cymbals.  Lyrically, this song is as good as any Billy Joel song. <br /> <br />\\"My Life\\": This is a signature Billy Joel song.   Billy piano is the more dominant instrument, but there is some nice guitar work.  Many people forget this became the theme song for the TV show \\"Bosom Buddies\\".   Many people don't realize that one of the terrific background vocalists is none other than Chicago vocalist, Peter Cetera. <br /> <br />\\"Zanzibar\\": After the first three songs, most of the songs are forgotten about.  This song is in this category and is probably one of the best on this collection.   This song has a terrific \\"Old New York\\" flair to it.  There is is almost a piano bar feel to this song.  I love Billy Joel songs with \\"characters\\" (i.e. \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"Anthony's Song\\").  This song introduces us to two characters - Ali and Rose. It starts out as a fast paced song.  There is a beautiful soft interlude almost 3 minutes into the song with some horns, then the pacepicks up again.  <br /> <br />\\"Stiletto\\": This is also one of the best on this collection.  This is another overlooked song.   Once again - a definite \\"New York\\" feel to it.  It starts out with some nice horn work, then has some of Billy's best piano work.   There is also outstanding percussion in this song.   A Stiletto is some sort of a \\"dagger\\" and this song deals with backstabbing.   Terrific track. <br /> <br />\\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\": This song is a Latin influenced song - keeping with the \\"Melting Pot Theme\\".  References to \\"Herald Square\\" keep to the \\"New York\\" feel.   Ralph MacDonald who performed on \\"Saturday Night Fever's \\"Calypso Breakdown\\" provides percussion.   Billy does a great job giving the vocals a Latin feel as well. Another great track. <br /> <br />\\"Half a Mile Away\\": This song has a great balance of piano and guitar as well as horns.  It has some terrific background vocals.  It definitely has an \\"New York\\" sound to it.  Ralph MacDonald also contributes percussion <br /> <br />\\"Until the Night\\": This is perhaps the most underrated of all the underrated songs.  It starts out with a retro sound - something Billy Joel has always been interested with.  This is one of Billy's first songs with a true late 1950s sound to it.  This is a sign of things to come (i.e. his 1983 \\"An Innocent Man\\" album). <br /> <br />\\"52th Street\\": The title along is New York sounding and the song lives up to this.  This is almost the perfect New York/Street sounding jazz song - perfect way to wrap up the collection. <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics as well as musician and production credits.  This is truly a magnificent collection.  If you like \\"The Stranger\\", this album is sure to equally satisfy - as well as provide some \\"forgotten\\" Billy Joel tunes.  Highly recommended.
B0007O38F8|5.0|if you're not bumping this disc, you're either a die-hard 50 hater, or you just can't get your personal feelings past 50 to enjoy his music. the disc is great, as are the beats, and the lyrics are exactly what i expected them to be: violent, confident, challenging, and funny. he may not have the lyrical skill of his peers, but he is becoming the same media giant that eminem has become. not sure where the 'piggy bank' diss will go in the rap industry though. he's either pulled a magnificent publicity stunt, or 50 may be the next martyr similar to tupac or biggie....dilate your mind
B00005JMFQ|2.0|The cast, headed by Hugh Grant, was so promising that 5-10 minutes into the movie you figure the movie must have cost an arm and a leg to produce...<br /><br />Though funny at many points, the movie starts to get diluted very early in the game, with so many different plots, that you start \\"missing\\" characters until they come back much later into the movie. The biggest problem with this plethora of plots is that most of them are resolved quite poorly, or left unclear. Barely a couple of the stories kept me engaged all the way through, specially since so many of them had such a weird ending.<br /><br />As much expectation as we had for this chick flick, it turned out to be quite dissapointing. Save yourself the time and rent some other Hugh Grant movie. As for this one, definitely not his best or a good movie worth checking out.
630460291X|5.0|Swashbuckling adventure abounds in this fun version of the story of Robin Hood. Starring Kevin Costner as the title carachter and Morgan Freeman as his trusty Moorish sidekick, Azeem, this movie flat-out rules! There is a lot of fun action and adventure, with a fair share of humor, too. Also, Sean Connery has an uncredited cameo as King Richard. This is one of the greatest swashbuckling adventures ever filmed!
B00004T9UF|5.0|YES! this is eminem's BEST album in my opinion, this album is pure genius, his lyrics r just really good and meaningful and the beats were perfect!(thanx 2 dre) and all 18 tracks (including 4 skits) are great and listenable. It's abit hard 2 pick my favourite songs out of dem all considering the whole album is good but! ill name the best ones... <br />Fav Songs : \\"The Way I Am\\" \\"The Real Slim ShadY\\" \\"Bitch Please II\\" \\"Stan\\" \\"Kill You\\" ah look, i can honestly name the whole entire album so ill just leave it at that. <br /> <br />\\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" will always be a classic and also i recommend this album for you all!
0800141601|4.0|First Knight is a entertaining version of the Arthurian legends, but there are a few detractors. Sean Connery is hardly in the film at all, giving Richard Gere as Lancelot WAY too much time on screen. And Sean Connery's name is listed first. Go figure. And Richard Gere as Lancelot is a pretty bad choice. I would have picked Viggo Mortensen or Kevin Costner. However, this is still a fun swashbuckling movie which can hold it's own against other of this genre. It's a great movie to watch with lots of popcorn.
B00005JKGV|5.0|I'll make this short... <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest, strangest, creepiest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br />The problem is, people try to analyze this movie waaay to deeply.

1563898586|1.0|This was one of the worst books i have ever read and i am a big reader. I'm telling all people who read this do not, i repeat DO NOT waste your money on this book it is terrible, no its beyond terrible. I don't know how people can say its better then the movie because their is no comparison, i mean the movie is not one of the most popular but its still a really good movie and compared to the book the movie show will as many oscars as possible. Adding Dorian Gray and Tom Sawyer to the movie was a very good idea, the book is terrible, it you want to know the story just watch the movie most people are not giving it the credit it deserves. Mina's character was not the most well thought out one and like someone said earlier, back in 1898 they would not have put a women in charge. Plus Dorian Gray isn't even in the book yet his picture is on the cover, and in my opinion there are to many rapes in this book the parts there in its just not nesecery to be there, its doesn't hold the story together they could have found griffen some other way. Just please don't waste your money on this just watch the movie leave the book in the dark where it belongs.
031286504X|4.0|What a great airplane read. I bought this at LAX and it kept me devotedly busy for the next couple of days.  I'm not much of a vampire-reader... not into the whole Lestat/Ann Rice scene or style.  What I liked about this was the narrator's scientific, blunt approach to his highly macabre predicament.<br /><br />Don't want to give away too much of the plot, and I'm sure most of the other reviewers already gave you what you need in terms of the general story line.<br /><br />My main criticisms:<br /><br />1) The ending is too swiftly delivered to us. I wouldn't mind a little longer denouement to pay me off for my patience throughout Neville's ordeal;<br /><br />2) Mr. Matheson uses too many adverbs. There are some real clunker descriptions sprinkled throughout, but luckily they seem to fade into the background once the pace picks up.<br /><br />But on the whole, a very cool book.  Written in 1954 -- it must have been revolutionary.  The whole genetics/epidemic storyline was way ahead of its time, and contemporary monster lore and hit movies -- most recently, \\"Twenty-Eight Days Later\\" -- owe it a huge debt of gratitude.<br /><br />If you buy the Orb Book edition, copyright 1995, you get the added bonus of a handful of short stories at the back of the book. Most of those were fun, though \\"Dance of the Dead\\" annoyed me and tested my patience a great deal. Actually, a few of the stories tested my patience. But to finally read \\"Prey\\" --the story forming the basis of the Devil Doll segment of Karen Black's classic, \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" -- was a real treat for me.<br /><br />\\"The Near Departed\\" is an amusing gag story, and \\"Buried Talents\\" is suitably mysterious and satisfyingly unresolved.<br /><br />Matheson is an interesting writer, responsible for a whole heck of a lot of Twilight Zone episodes -- so if you're a fan like me who can sit in front of the marathons for days at a time, it's in your best interest to read this novel and the stories that come with it.  You won't be disappointed.it.  You won't be disappointed.
B0007O38F8|2.0|yes people r mad at 50 for booting game and so am i...this album isnt that good though.. serously these songs show how big of an ego he has...hes dissin like 8 rapper. sayin hes the best...i dont even like Ja rule or Jada or Fat joe...its just the fact that even they are laughin at him..4 thinkin hes the KING OF RAP..which he is not...50 cent is just gettin luaghed at....he says that he the most  best at writing lyrics.he said he even tops tuapc and biggie...GET THE DOCUMENTRY...the game is a rapper who pays respect to other rappers.
B00008H2LB|1.0|I really dont get this new music. Screaming in a microphone about breaking a habit is not what I call music. I have so much to say...but I know Ill just piss you guys off. This music sucks....ok? Rap sucks too.... got it? Real rock music was at its perfecting in the early 70's. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix all saw the meaning of music and life. This meaningless Linkin Park crap...is just....loud and irritating. Plus they are sell outs! God damn this band sucks....
0385512058|5.0|Great read.  On top of the interesting anecdotes that tie it all together, this is one of those books that is just loaded with practical advice to advance yourself personally and professionally.  I sometimes doubt the effectiveness of business best practices, \\"how to\\" or self-help type books, but I can tell you the networking tactics and truths revealed in this book have already helped me in significant ways in my own career.  A must read for every working professional.
0393960188|5.0|This review is for the Norton Critical Edition of Persuasion, and has two parts: a review of Persuasion itself, and a review of Norton Content.    No educated person disputes Austen's contribution to the literary world. While her particular craft may not be palatable to all types (whose is?), I maintain that of all Austen's works, Persuasion is the one to hold the most appeal to those unfamiliar with her literature. It could be a `gateway drug', introducing the reader to Austen, or it could be a delightful `one-book stand'; whichever way works for the reader.    Concealed within Regency trappings is a universal story: there is a `mythic' quality to it in the sense that C.S. Lewis defines myth. The story reaches through space and time to grab the heart and attention of the reader, compelling her both on and deeper. When the novel opens, Anne Elliot faces the prospect of meeting once again a man with whom she was compelled to break off an engagement nearly eight years prior. While relatively little outward action takes place, Austen builds tension through Anne's inner conflict. Peripheral issues, such as the nature of the change in social systems in this turbulent time in Britain and the place of women in society, serve as complementary fare that highlights the mounting dilemma that Anne faces. In Austen style, the resolution and denouement are highly satisfying and truly ingenious, and the reader is left with meaty material to savor for days to come.    The Norton contribution to Persuasion is indispensable. Though I was previously familiar with Persuasion, a favorite professor of mine introduced me to the commentary and contributions within this edition. The preface lays out a road map of sorts for the rest of the book. Included immediately after the conclusion of the novel is the original ending-something that even the non-lit majors in my class found interesting. A fabulous selection of backgrounds and contexts follows, with items such as Henry Austen's \\"Biographical Notice of the Author\\", and a selection from Richard Whateley's \\"Review of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion\\", entitled \\"A New Style of Novel\\".    Additionally, modern critical commentary is included from Austen scholars Marilyn Butler, Ann Astell, Claudia Johnson, and others. Appearing at the end are a helpful chronology and selected bibliography. Patricia Meyer Spacks did a fabulous and much appreciated job in editing and pulling the work together. This edition is highly recommended, both within the classroom, and without.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|What an excellent movie!  If you had any interest in \\"Garden State\\" or \\"Rushmore\\" then you will really be able to crawl into this movie.  And crawl you must.  Sorry, no express trolley to the underlying theme, or spoon feeding of plot here.<br /><br />Bill Murray has always been an interesting choice to star in movies that don't sport a hard-core comedy theme, but he is seemless in this movie.<br /><br />I wish I had more time to work on this review (my apologies, as the movie truly deserves serious accolades) but again, if you had any interest in either of the two movies above, then you should have no problem grooving to this slow-burn beat. (Oh, and the music is fantastic!! Again think Garden State / Rushmore)<br /><br />Kudos Bill.
B00005V1Y0|2.0|I will say this movie had good dancing and at times was very sweet with the love story, but that's about it.  I guess it's the cinamatography that I really don't like, the way it is filmed feels almost unprofessional.   <br /> <br />The acting is over the top at times and it seems like the people acting are forced and not natural.  There is almost no back story to the whole plot, it barely touches on the past of this dance foundation or whatever it's called.   <br /> <br />This could have been much better.  It was nice to watch once, but I don't need to see it again.  I'd say rent it from your library.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|At age 45 I'm just getting around to seeing a lot of the classics I'd always ignored.  All I knew of \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" until this week was that it was a high society comedy with James Stewart.  Sounded a bit blah to me.  Imagine my surprise to find a screwball romantic comedy that happens to take place in high society, and to find Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant as well.  I guess I never paid the film much attention because of its boring title; sounds like a Revolutionary War film about the history of the city.    Instead we have a hilarious picture based on a stage play.  It ends just as I expected it would from the opening scene, but, with all the glorious twists and turns in between, who cares if it's ultimately a bit predictable?  The joys of the film include some unexpectedly fall-down funny moments of both verbal and physical comedy, wonderful lighting (it seems films in color can never quite get the lighting to be a character in the way they could in these old B&W flicks), and the wonder of how director George Cukor managed to make this stage play look quite un-stagey.    Other Amazon reviewers may grouse about the Oscar awarded to Stewart (I agree that had to be a make-good), but the film was nominated in several other categories, including a Best Actress nomination for Hepburn.  This is a lady who deserved every bit of attention she ever got; history has borne out her brilliance even in the days when she wasn't appreciated.  Kudos to Warner Home Video for such a great package, with all the extras attached, to maintain the status of \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" as one of the greatest films ever made.  Just wish that title had even 1% of the pizzazz of the movie itself.
B0007O38F8|2.0|Im a true and true g-unit fan.  been to the concerts, buy the cds, not just the ones you can buy in kmart.  im talking about underground stuff, g-unit radio.  i woke up on march 3rd at 8:30 am so i could be one of the first in the store to purchase the massacre.  i had looked at the cover and was dissappointed a week before on amazon.com and could only hope that the tracks on the cd wouldn't disappoint me like the cover.  i popped it in my car cd player as soon as i got in.  i had a frown on my face until track 5 which is piggy bank.  and unlike GRODT i had no expression on my face for the rest of the cd.  this is a cd that i will burn with the 4 or 5 tracks that i really like and the rest can be thrown in the garbage.  im a sad g-unit fan, i can only sit and wait for the new g-unit cd and hope that its not trash like this one!
B00005JKEZ|3.0|Errol Flynn's \\"Adventures of Robin Hood\\" was the \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" of its day, a roller coaster ride, a thrill a minute, etc.  Of course, \\"Raiders\\" took its inspiration from films like this and from the serial thrillers of the '30s, so that's no surprise.  Today our cultural remembrances of Robin Hood spring from this film, so great is its fame and so deep is our love as a society for the character who reputedly defended the defenseless against heartless oppressors.    And one cannot fault many of the performances in this relic, my personal favorite being Claude Rains as the amoral Prince John; not a bit of overdone melodrama on his part, in spite of his opportunities to chew the scenery.  Rains plays the character as smoothly as anyone could wish.  The cinematography is beautiful and often the shots are inventive, including the famous shadowed climactic swordfight between Robin and Sir Guy.  The story is generally well written and the pace is just right.    It's easy to see why this is such a long-time favorite.  But as a first-time viewer to this film I'm not overwhelmed.  Another reviewer on this page gushes, \\"If this movie is not a five star film, then none are.\\"  So, I suppose none are, though I could name about 100 better movies (Lawrence of Arabia, Local Hero, The Philadelphia Story, The Lady Eve, Treasure Of the Sierra Madre, The Matrix, Streetcar Named Desire, Casablanca, Double Indemnity, the aforementioned Raiders...OK OK, I'll stop there, but that list took only about 30 seconds to come up with).    The flaws in this film almost outweigh its positives.  Consider the too-convenient story logic that says, first:  \\"How do we get the word to Robin and his men?  Don't worry, he has ears in every bush, he'll find out.\\"  But later Maid Marian has to sneak out of the castle to get word to his men that he's been arrested and will be hanged.  What happened to ears in every bush?    Consider the early scene with Robin in Sir Guy's castle as Prince John's \\"guest.\\"  He has to shoot his way out, and while his quiver initially carried about four or five arrows he manages to get off seven or eight shots.....and still leaves the castle with at least three arrows in that magical quiver.    Consider also the poor editing when Robin \\"welcomes\\" Sir Guy to Sherwood Forest:  Flynn turns to his left as if about to leap out of the tree, which he does in the next shot, but the closeup goes on too long and we see Flynn stop in midstep awaiting the director to cry \\"Cut!\\"    Consider also the lame mockery of swordfighting that often goes on behind the main characters in the climactic battle between the men of Richard and John:  Extras clearly just trying not to hurt themselves or each other.    Consider again the fight between Robin and Sir Guy:  On the stairs the bad guy's sword is right in Robin's gut for a full beat before he's pushed over the stairs, whereas a moment like that in reality would have meant immediate death for our hero, ah, but this is Hollywood.    Consider, finally, the scene where Robin and Marian declare their love:  Their noses an inch apart, the director chooses to insert closeups, each of Flynn and de Havilland, that feature several inches of blank air in front of each nose.  She also tilts her head in a different direction in each shot.  Laughable.    Silly, absolutely silly errors of continuity, staging, writing, and editing that unnecessarily mar some really brilliant moments of early cinema.  I'm sure there are more charitable souls than mine who are willing to overlook such sloppy work, or at least to simply overlook it as the residue of the early years when Hollywood was still perfecting the craft, but I can think of earlier films that were more perfectly made (Modern Times, Svengali, The Kid, Camille, Les Miserables...oh, I do go on).
B0006J28KU|5.0|After the commercial and critical success of The Last of the Mohicans, filmmaker Michael Mann made his most ambitious film up to that point in his career with Heat. He cast legendary actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino as the leads in what would be their first the on-screen appearance together in a movie (they were in The Godfather: Part II but never appeared in the same scene). Mann returned to a 1986 draft of a screenplay that originated before he made The Jericho Mile. A few years ago, Warner Brothers released a bare bones DVD of Heat. To celebrate the 10th anniversary, Mann has revisited his movie and assembled an excellent collection of extras.<br /><br />Mann contributes a characteristically solid audio commentary. He provides a lot of details into the backgrounds and motivations of the film's characters. Surprisingly, there is very little overlap from the featurettes as Mann's comments start off strong but become more infrequent after the 90 minute mark.<br /><br />The strongest extra is \\"The Making of Heat,\\" an excellent 54-minute retrospective documentary that can be viewed in three separate featurettes or altogether. Many of the major and minor cast members are back for brand new interviews and offer insightful comments, including Al Pacino, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore amongst others. This is in-depth look at how Heat was put together and provides the whole story for casual fans and fascinating insight for devotees.<br /><br />\\"Pacino and De Niro: The Conversation\\" explores the famous on-screen meeting between these two actors. Mann subverts our expectations by delaying their eventual meeting and then, when it does happen, it is at a diner over coffee and not what one expects with this kind of a movie.<br /><br />\\"Return to the Scene of the Crime\\" features location manager Janice Polley revisiting many of the locations used in the movie. Mann wanted to find locations in Los Angeles that had never been put on film before in order to create a distinctive look.<br /><br />Finally, there are 11 deleted scenes that include the most revealing excised bit of footage in a scene where McCauley and his crew get ready just before they enter the bank while one of his gang is interrogated by rogue psycho, Waingro that should have been kept in. There is nothing terribly earth-shattering about this excised footage but there are a couple of good moments.<br /><br />The scale and star power of Heat was unlike anything Mann had ever tried before and firmly announced him as force to be reckoned within Hollywood. This two-DVD set is a fitting tribute for this important film. The transfer and sound are very well done with extras that are substantial and plentiful, providing a really good look at how this epic movie was put together.create a distinctive look.<br /><br />Finally, there are 11 deleted scenes that include the most revealing excised bit of footage in a scene where McCauley and his crew get ready just before they enter the bank while one of his gang is interrogated by rogue psycho, Waingro that should have been kept in.

B00005JL9B|5.0|Someone wrote a review on here saying it cannot be viewed in the U.S. the reason is because it is region 3 not region 1, most dvd players are region 1, the cheap ones. You must get a all-region dvd player. If you have a ps2, i recommend gameshark 2 v4 because it has an all-region.
B0007P3582|1.0|50 cent basically embodies everything that is wrong with the world these days when it comes down to music. he proves that selling massive amounts of albums and getting loaded with all kinds of dubious music-awards really doesn't have anything to do with any form of musical ability, or creativity for that matter. Just like his previous album, this one is also filled with drowsy, monotonous bores that should pass as 'rappy jazzy'  <br /> <br />That's not to say that this music is 'inoffensive'. For most people it IS inoffensive, just pleasant musical wallpaper that doesn't disturb a family dinner or an half an hour of washing the dishes, which declares the ridiculous amount of sales. For me, and thankfully many others who appreciate good music, this music IS offensive. It's mindnumbingly bland easy listening that doesn't even deserve to be labeled as music, but is seen as such, which is an insult. Yes, every song sounds exactly the same as the song before, so why do people spend their hard-earned money on this drivel? It really has some kind of brainwash-effect: after an hour of 50 cent's easy listening-horror, you'll likely feel like all the blood is sucked right out of your body. If they're looking for something that's inoffensive yet beautiful, why not check out the pianoworks of McFly, or a collection of gorgeous jazz-ballads by Gary Barlow?  <br /> <br />I didnt enjoy the experience of listening to this album one little bit. Unless your a 50 year old woman going through a mid life crisis i wouldn't recomend this to you.Yes, that pretty much describes it. Auditory valium might be another. Although I might have liked some of her work in the past, the chronic over play on the radio has pretty much doomed that forever. Monotone, no range and all the songs just sort of all blend together after a while into sort of a hallucinatory collage stream of consciousness thang. The difference between this album and the last are hints of country music, which come off as totallycontrived and as an attempt to appeal to a different audience, rather than the authentic article. This is what happens when the critics give an undeserving artist too much praise - they believe their own hype and are lazy about their own craft.  <br /> <br />50 cent is a loser...he cannot sing, dance, is fake, and an MJ wannabe What happens when an over hyped very naughty rapprt gets with an over hyped producer? You get Massacre! I am so sick of hearing people stick up for this kid, it's wack. He has no talent, please just go and listen to his music! This is just another Gayr Barlow act that brings white suburban kids to the record store. This music is safe kids, you don't need to worry about not fitting in, everyone is buying it! An over hyped Gary Barlow, act this kid makes me sick. Rich little brat who buys all the good producers and then makes even more money, more and more money. Rich people getting richer not really giving us anything important or artistic, just making a few bucks off of worthless garbage. This guy has no talent, he has no soul at all, his voice sucks. If you ask me, Nick Lachey would sound much better singing these lyrics.  <br /> <br />Let's take a look at the songs: \\"Candy Shop \\" gets off to a decent start with mariachi-inspired guitar and an infectious beat, bu, and 50 cent's melodramatic vocal weakens the track as well. \\"This Is 50 \\", is such a blatant attempt to copy Barlow's \\"Open Road\\" that copyright charges could stand in court - the difference is that the innocuous vibe of Barlow's song is replaced with typically randy, raunchy lyrics from 50 cent. Speaking of which - the lyrics on the duet with 50 cent, \\"Gunz Come Out\\" makes this album unacceptable for 50 cent's younger fans - smart move, alienating your core audience. . The rest of the album reveals an egomaniac who loves name-checking himself and boasting about his prowess with the opposite sex - this in turn basically alienates everyone with the exception of teenage girls. This album is the sound of a self-absorbed prima donna who may be talented but has achieved too much success too quickly and consequently releases overproduced meaningless drivel, like this album. Did I mention that 50 cent CANT EVEN DANCE! Watching 50 cent gyrate and try to keep in rhythm is comical. His Stevie Wonder impression is tacky, worthless and hysterical.Can't wait to see him attempt to \\"out-dance\\" the self-proclaimed \\"King of Pop\\" MJ. If sex appeal were like dynamite, he couldn't blow the cobwebs off his own balls! His singing is like moaning, expecting a woman to solve all his problems. If he ever got with a girl, I don't think he'd have the slightest clue what to do with her. There's really nothing more loathsome than one such as he who constantly wallows in self-pity. A very repulse creature that is. He's so dense he's developing a horizon from which not even a clue could escape. If he doesn't tell the truth about himself in his music, then how can he can tell it about others?? His songs may be sweet and loving, however, neither of these traits do I hold in high regard. My mother used to think he was cute, back in his good looking days in '02 & '03. But now she hates his whole new look and the way he's trying to be a bold boy, he's only making a fool of himself and there I must concur. what's with that? black boy tries to be bold? ugh, as the saying goes, don't try to be what you're not! as he's not bold , not a real singer, nor even a good dancer. Sniper the assclown. He souds like a cross between a retarded elephand and a mentally unstable woman.
B00005JMAH|1.0|Let me start by saying this is a very disappointing piece of garbage and it was doomed to be so from the beginning.Now let me explain why,I seriously doubt the person who wrote the script for this movie even read the books.The book itself was completely ignored in the making of this film,and what wasn't ignored was changed for stupid marketing reasons.Although I did not like the movie too much blame cannot be placed on the movie industry.  if they had stayed true to the book the movie would have probably been 16 hours long.if they had to leave out that much of the third book, the fourth movie will be even worse.the proper thing to do is quit making these movies and spend more money promoting the books.  These books are truly works of art and to see them mutilated by some big conglomerate movie company is really disheartening for the true fans.
B000001Y42|5.0|In the mid-to-late 90's, alternative metal bands found they could make it big by jumping on the rap/rock bandwagon. Soon after, legions of upset metalheads and their wannabe cohorts decided to create a bandwagon of their own--to dis rap/rock, and most notibly, Limp Bizkit and their frontman Fred Durst. <br /> <br />I can understand why so many people hate Fred Durst, but that has little to do with this album. If you aren't into rap/rock at all, this CD isn't for you. But if you don't mind the genre's more talented selections, there isn't a reason to dislike this one. With the exception of the goofy cover of George Michael's \\"Faith,\\" this is an actually good CD. While it still is HEAVILY rap/rock, you can tell Durst's lyrics are truly heart-felt on this CD. Not until the album \\"Significant Other\\" did Fred Durst start churning out dull rap cliches like \\"N 2 Gether Now,\\" filling songs with too many guest appearances and mentioning his own name repeatedly. <br /> <br />Aside from Limp's later disasters, this CD strikes big with open-minded listeners with songs they can relate to--about breakups like in \\"Sour,\\" bum friends in \\"Leech,\\" two-faced people in \\"Counterfeit,\\" and so on. Yes, the CD seems to center around the general theme of having conflicts with those around him, but each song delivers a different angle on the subject. Unlike the rest of the Bizkit CDs to come, this one offers Sam Rivers' funky hip-hop bass groves that mesh surprisingly well with Wes Borland's contrasting unique metal guitar style,  John Otto's heavy rhythmic drumming, and DJ Lethal's sometimes psychedelic spins and samples. The album hits the listener full-forced and straight on, with the exception of the interesting musical interludes between songs and the lenghty acid trip at the end called \\"Everything,\\" which all add to the dynamics of the disc. <br /> <br />While many bands have banked off--or tried to--the now generic rap/rock formula, Limp Bizkit pulled it off in a way that many other bands (and themselves on later dics) have failed in. Please don't let their lastest works, the single \\"Faith,\\" or the ever popular Durst-bashing bandwagon steer you away from checking out this diamond-in-the-rough called \\"Three Dollar Bill, Y'All.\\" If you're open-minded enough to form your own opinion of it, you might find yourself satisfied with another good CD in your rotation. <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|3.0|This album in a nutshell was a slight dissapointment. Being a Music Producer myself i was expecting quite a folllow up to the success of Get Rich Or Die Tryin and as hard as it is to top that album i was expecting a decent attempt. The main problem with this entire album is the production. There are entirely too many kanye style sampled beats which are too complex and meaningfull for fifty's rhyme style. If you've heard 50's \\"Power of The Dollar\\" album before he was signed with aftermath this album would most closely compare to that. It seems that the 11 mil sold on his last album and the constant media attention has almost made him greedy and over zealous. it sounds like he approached this album with less energy and motivation. In all honesty I have noticed a gradual downfall in 50's performance since Beg For Mercy and it's clearly evident on this album.  <br />   Im not all about negatives; the album does have some cuts that are solid tracks with a little bit of a different feel. In my opinion one of the best produced tracks (beat wise) on the album is \\"position of power.\\" the piano loop and the bass line invoke a feeling in you thats hard to describe. \\"Piggy Bank\\" asside from all the hype is nothing more than a media stunt to boost sales nevertheless a good song.\\"Im Supposed To Die To Tonight\\" is a good song and a good concept probally the best hook on the album too. \\"Ski-Mask way\\" is another well produced track..more for the harder crowd but a really good song. Both the singles were good but already played out by the time u get the album. \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" probally the most clever record on the album is a story about heroin addiction in which 50 portrays the song speaking as the drug itself. Everything else in my opinion is pretty much mediocre and not standoutish...Dre's \\"Outa Control\\" was a dissapointment from a production aspect after hearing an absolute banger like \\"how we do\\" The song \\"Gatman and Robin\\" is yet another goofy eminem song and i thoughtit was really cheezy to be completely truthfull..Overall, if ya like 50 buy the cd cause your already a dedicated fan and u know you'll find the tracks u like on the album...hip-hop critics, people only slightly into rap, and those who hate the discussion of hood antics shootings, robbery, and comin up, do yourself a favor and save the $15 bucks for a Tim Mcgraw CD. <br />DanielJameS
B000005J56|3.0|The best thing about this CD is the publicity it gave to Cuban music. Most of the musicians on Buena Vista were good in their day, but many are way passed their prime.     For example, listen to Compay Segundo's singing and tres playing on the classic 1950s recordings compiled on Tumbao's \\"Balcon de Santiago\\". You'll find that Buena Vista sounds pretty second rate in comparison.    Eliades de Ochoa was never very good, and Ry Cooder and his slide guitar sound very out place. If you're setting out to make a recording of classic Cuban music, I'm not sure why you'd want to add American slide guitar. Cooder sounds good on blues, I wish he would stick to what he knows.    Finally, the production is too washed out sounding. They've added so much reverb that the music lacks vitality.     So, balancing the good and the bad, you won't regret having bought this CD, but you probably won't love it either. I strongly urge anyone interested in this kind of music to seek out the original recordings - many of which are available on Amazon.    Further Recommendations:  If you're looking for a better CD with a similar concept, I recommend trying Super Uba's \\"Tierra Lejana\\" - a collection of classics from the Dominican Republic. The Afro Cuban All-stars - \\"A Toda Cuba Le Gusta\\" is also good and has some of the same musicians as Buena Vista.
B000001EL3|5.0|Let's be honest here; this is probably the only album in this band's career that I am drawn to (and even *that* doesn't say very much.) I consider Kiss to be, overall, a joke of a band that had some talent, but it was nothing too earth-shattering, and that the biggest thing they had going for them was their silly makeup. It was their gig in order to get payed big bucks, and obviously, it worked. Gene Simmons seems to be getting everything he desires, by way of the money that many of his fans are putting into his pocket.<br /><br />1976's _Destroyer_ is probably the band's best album, and it's considered so for a reason.<br /><br />Big changes occured with this album. Kiss were pretty big by this time. But, their success wasn't the only thing big. When listening to this album here, we hear some major things that weren't heard on their earlier studio albums: choirs, strings, extra bombast, lush ballads; big leaps were made in the production alone, as the guitars are louder, and echo with more reverberation, and as mentioned above, strings and choirs are added to the mix, and as a result, _Destroyer_ is a much more lush, diverse Kiss offering.<br /><br />This leap forward in sound could have been largely due to the fact that Bob Ezrin (someone who has claimed to have his bouts of \\"delusions of grandeur\\") played the role of producer - his credits include Pink Floyd's _The Wall_ - and when listening to this, you can hear some of the theatrical lushness and bombast in production that would pervade albums like _The Wall_.<br /><br />So, with rockers like \\"Detroit Rock City,\\" and \\"King of The Night Time World,\\" we already hear the big production jumping out of the speakers. The former track is a Kiss classic, and deservedly so, while the latter is a Paul Stanley album track that has it's own mystical and melodic charm. When listening to it, the piece evokes images of a fantasy \\"night time world,\\" and Paul's mystical vocals help a great deal in adding to this atmosphere.<br /><br />\\"God of Thunder\\" is perhaps the one track that features Bob Ezrin's grandiose productions in beautiful extremes, well, at least out of all of the hard rockers found here. It's a monstrous track with crunching guitars and effects that seem to conjure of frightening images of the Mezosoic era coming to a resurrection, and dinosaurs are running rampant, destroying everything in their paths. Gene Simmons' vocals sound superhuman and goofy at the same time, which make me marvel at the superhuman-like quality of the sounds, while laughing hysterically at the same time.<br /><br />\\"Great Expectations\\" is something of a puzzle to me; it causes me to feel strongly ambivalent. Here, we have quite a classy, European-influenced track - complete with lush strings and choirs - which seems to reference a few of the greatest artists of our time: Charles Dickens and Beethoven. There's no telling if the title of this song was intended to reference the title of the novel written by the former, but Beethoven's \\"Pathetique\\" Sonata seems referenced. However, Kiss' usual tasteless, and unimpressive sleaziness is the thing that keeps me from enjoying this track to the fullest.<br /><br />Other songs on here like \\"Flaming Youth\\" feature some catchy choruses, and this song even features a brief instrumental jam in an odd time signature (7/8), while \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" earns a spot right next to \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" for featuring one of the most infectious, melodic choruses (even moreso here) that will want to get you to sing along. \\"Do You Love Me\\" seems like a change of pace for Kiss, as we see Paul Stanley reflecting on how his fans really feel about him. It's done in a semi-tongue-in-cheek way, but there seems to be a bit of seriousness behind it all.<br /><br />_Destroyer_ is classic, and considered by many to be Kiss' best studio album. This is my favorite studio album from Kiss, and probably the only one from them I won't be selling back to the local used bins.one track that features Bob Ezrin's grandiose productions in beautiful extremes, well, at least out of all of the hard rockers found here.

Other songs on here like \\"Flaming Youth\\" feature some catchy choruses, and this song even features a brief instrumental jam in an odd time signature (7/8), while \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" earns a spot right next to \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" for featuring one of the most infectious, melodic choruses (even moreso here) that will want to get you to sing along. \\"Do You Love Me\\" seems like a change of pace for Kiss, as we see Paul Stanley reflecting on how his fans really feel about him. It's done in a semi-tongue-in-cheek way, but there seems to be a bit of seriousness behind it all.    _Destroyer_ is classic, and considered by many to be Kiss' best studio album. This is my favorite studio album from Kiss, and probably the only one from them I won't be selling back to the local used bins.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I'm in awe of the musicianship & artistry that's present from beginning to end on this album. It far exceeds all expectations -- THANK YOU, JUDAS PRIEST!
B0007O38F8|5.0|After 50's first release, i didnt think he could top himself, But he did with this new album. Dre and Em came through with some of the sicket beats ive heard in awhile, and 50 thrilled me with his cuttin lyrics. this niggas fo real.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|Before you blast me as \\"retarded\\", \\"stupid\\", or tell me \\"just give them a chance man\\", let me say that The Mars Volta is my favorite band.  I have seen them six times live, and everytime has been awesome. <br /> <br />Anyways, upon hearing this album I was very dissapointed.  The Widow and L'Via L'Viaquez are some of the worst tracks by volta.  L'Via would be decent if it weren't for the untimely salsa solos that seem to take away all the driving force that the song could have.  The widow, well just listen to it... completely goes against what the mars volta regularly does. <br /> <br />Sure, the band shows a lot of technical skill, but technicality does not equal a great album.  They are each individually skilled, but the misplaced and random guitar solos, the untimely breakdowns, and the noodling help make this album mediocre isntead of great. <br /> <br />The two-three songs that do shine are Cygnus, Cassandra, and maybe Miranda.  However, I wonder if these songs only shine because of the low quality of the other two song.  This is something the album should have been filled with, except with less noodling.  The widow seems like it just got thrown in there because they had no where else to put it.  It fits nowhere on the cd.
B0007NFL1S|5.0|Yo, 50 done really did it with this CD. This CD is crazy. The best song in the album is \\"Piggy Bank\\". My friend just gave me this CD today and I was so anxious to listen to it, I couldn't wait til' school was over. Every single song is crazy. If I could I would give this CD 10 stars.
0316926345|5.0|Short & sweet because other reviewers have provided wonderful descriptions already: reading such a book as this is an education in itself.    Brideshead is a classic novel by a genuine master of English prose.  Well-worth reading not once, but many times, to understand the depth of the story itself as well as appreciate Waugh's obvious mastery of language.      Also highly recommended is Mortimer's adaptation of the book as a mini-series starring Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Anthony Andrews and Jeremy Irons.  It is the definitive Brideshead on film, from the opening lines spoken by Jeremy Irons (as usual, his speaking voice is flawless) to the final scene of Charles in Brideshead chapel during WWII where Charles prays \\"an ancient prayer, newly learned.\\"    (There are some reviewers who've given it a low rating based on their dislike of the underlying theme of the book.  Evelyn Waugh was a convert to Catholicism and his novel revolves around the characters' wandering away but ultimately back again, to faith: for the Flyte family, it is a return to their heritage (two of the most moving scenes are Lord Marchmain's death-bed conversion and Julia's painful but utterly noble decision), and for Charles Ryder (not \\"Simon\\" as a one-star critic mistakenly called him!  Have you read the book, sir?), it is a newly found conviction.  Hence, Book III's title \\"A Twitch upon the Thread\\" (quoting Chesterton), the thread referring to the fine, but strong pull of the Catholic faith over these individuals.  If this is the book's only 'flaw', as some assert it to be, perhaps this line from a Capra film will help: for those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not, no explanation is possible.  Agnostic, atheist or believer, the workings of grace is a mysterious thing.)
6304698526|4.0|This is definately one of Steve Mcqueen's best films.  McQueen play a dective assigned to protect a star witness who will be testifying about the criminal organiztion he once belonged to. So as not to spoil anything I will suffice it to say that the plot becomes action packed very quickly and includes what is probably best car chase that will ever be put on film, and made the 60's Mustang an icon in muscle car history. Long story short Steve Mcqueen is an amazing actor, and this is an amazing film
0316172324|1.0|I picked up Blink solely on Gladwell's prior work, The Tipping Point.  I should have allowed thin-slicing to work and passed this by. <br /> <br />Oh, if you wish to read what dozens of other researchers have to say about snap judgements and why we make them, it is a passable read.  However, if you are looking for the application in your own life...look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Along about page 100, I wanted to put it down because it seemed to have little to say.  Another thin-slice I missed.  By the time I got to the end of the book, I felt like my time had been wasted...not to mention the money.  The good news for me is that I got the book at a considerable discount. <br /> <br />I agree with one of the other reviewers here, i.e., \\"take a nap, instead...\\"
B000005H40|5.0|I'm sorry. It's 5 stars again!. I couldn't do less with this one.  <br />This is only apt for cheering you up!. Loads of swing and power. Difficult to find a better hard-bop music example. So don't waste your time and have this one!.  <br />First reason and above all, we're talking about Coltrane here. 'Hello?'. Yes. In the same league with the 3 monsters of Jazz: Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Duke Ellington. And the next on my list is probably Coltrane. <br />But he's not alone in here: Curtis Fuller ('oh my gosh!') and Lee Morgan. 'Oh!. We keep talking, man!'. Those two lads have been essential in the spread of hard-bop everywhere ('Art Blakey?; Jazz Messengers?; sounds something to you?'). And they're all very young here starting their promising careers. Now they belong to the great legacy of music. With the Gods of Jazz. <br />But there's even more in \\"Blue Train\\"!. Mr. PC on the bass using the bow quite often. Kenny Drew on piano; doing wonders. And Philly Joe Jones in one of his best performances. <br />'But yes!. I'm guilty. I'm an old-fashioned regarding jazz'. I don't trade a classic for anything. And \\"Blue Train\\" is truly a classic. I don't have a job in Amazon or something like that. And I don't get any money from them for just writing 5 star reviews ('Just my luck!') but you're silly if you don't buy this one. Or just a lazy bird like I am. Get in locomotion!. You can fly on a blue train!. I did.
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|Yah gotta love the creaters of X-Men in any form. <br />I would never have picked Hugh Jackman for Wolverine [One of my top favorites from the comics] but he tends to be excellent in the part. <br /> <br />It is so hard to translate comic characters into human form but they sure did it.  The X-Men come alive.   <br />With the lose of Jean Gray do we now look forward to The Phenoix [?] <br /> <br />I hope these guys don't wait forever in bringing the X-Men stories up to date -- too many years pass inbetween and we lose the ongoing line of our characters. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- for us comic buffs - great to add to the comic collection.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|In my opinion, I thought this CD was MUCH better than her first. It really seems like she's grown a lot. Instead of being this petulant little whining kid, she's actually grown into a full blown angst-rocker. Plus, it's undeniably catchy. She sort of sounds like Alanis Morrisette's little sister. A little like Ariel S. Lee. (she's good but unknown, check her out!) <br /> <br />Song-by-song review. <br /> <br />1. Take Me Away: 7/10, a good track to open with. It's very rock-ish and upbeat, not too emotionally in-depth though. <br /> <br />2. Together: 9/10 My FAVORITE song. It's great; it's got dual vocals that mesh perfectly on the chorus, and it's about a couple falling apart and feeling seperated. If that's happened to you before, you know how that feels. <br /> <br />3. Don't Tell Me: 7/10 The first radio single. It's basically an anti-Britney anthem of, \\"don't try and sleep with me or I'll kick your a**.\\" For those who like that kind of girl power, it's good. <br /> <br />4. He Wasn't: 3/10 This has to be the MOST ANNOYING SONG I have EVER HEARD. The chorus is just a racous yammering and the whole point of it is basically her getting rejected over the phone. Or something. Who cares? Fast forward! <br /> <br />5. How Does It Feel: 6/10 This is a refreshing slow song, and it actually works! It's just sort of a reflection on walking in other people's shoes, accompanied by cellos. <br /> <br />6. My Happy Ending: 8/10 My second favorite song...super catchy, lyrically and musically. It speaks plain sense..\\"Let's talk this over, it's not like we're dead...\\" and goes on to a spoiled-fairytale rant of a chorus. <br /> <br />7. Nobody's Home: 7/10 I really liked this one at first, then got tired of it. It's catchy too, but it gets old fast. Plus..the meaning is kind of obscure. <br /> <br />8. Forgotten: 3/10 This is like a bad Alanis Morrisette copy. She sounds angry, but for no good reason, \\"Have you forgotten everything that I wanted?!\\" She just sounds spoiled, and not very scary. <br /> <br />9. Who Knows: 7/10 Hey! A cheery Avril song! Who knew they could exist! But here it is, and it actually works pretty well. <br /> <br />10. Fall to Pieces:8/10 This is a great slow one...catchy, and romantic. It talks about being in love with someone and just wanting to sit there and capture the moment. Nice song. <br /> <br />11. Freak Out: 6/10 Very Avril-esque. The chorus tells you just to \\"freak out let it go.\\" Actually, that's pretty much the whole song. Catchy and fun, but not too deep. <br /> <br />12. Slipped Away: 2/10 I'm sorry...I know this is for her dead Grandpa, but it's a horrible, horrible song. The limp lyrics, the nonexistant tune...it sounds like someone in 6th grade wrote it.  <br /> <br />13. I Always Get What I Want [Bonus]: 5/10 Very punk-ish. <br /> <br />So, that's the review. She did a good job, considering nobody's perfect! But...remember P!nk? You've gotta wait until the third CD comes out to really judge anything.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|First off the music on this CD is Judas Priest at their best, classic Priest with new twists.  But beware when buying the \\"Dual Disc\\" version.  There is a diclaimer sticker on the back of jewel case stating that the audio side may not play on all CD players.  So, just a suggestion, pay the extra money and buy the normal 2 disc version and enjoy.....The Prest is Back
0553579908|5.0|In \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" George R.R. Martin's first novel in his \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, the tenuous peace of the Seven Kingdoms was shattered with the murder of King Robert and his right-Hand man, Ned Stark.  A mad scramble for power ensued, both on the battlefield and in the royal courts, but despite carnage, betrayal, and death, nothing was resolved, and the novel ended with an already war-torn nation contemplating its riven future.   <br /> <br />\\"A Clash of Kings\\" spins the complex yarn of the various pieces in this magnificent chess game . . . and one wonders how Martin himself can keep things straight.  Like the first novel, \\"Clash\\" uses each chapter to tell the story from a different character's perspective.  This daring scheme works, and works well.  Martin gives each character a unique voice as well as perspective on events, and he is even able to \\"simplify\\" the story whenever a younger person is providing that perspective.  The scheme also works because as Martin jumps from character to character, each chapter offers another opportunity for a tantalizing cliff-hanger.  Sure, it can be difficult to say sayonara to a character for 80-odd pages, but the reunions between reader and character are fun. <br /> <br />The Seven Kingdoms are a martial land, to be sure, and most of the characters are rather grim -- not surprising, given the circumstances.  Fortunately, Martin allows the dwarf, Tyrion Lannister, to tell much of this story, and Tyrion is a blessedly conflicted combination of Falstaff, MacBeth, and Dr. Evil, and the reader can delight in Tyrion's clever wickedness and his shreds of honor.  The novel allows few opportunities for humor, but Tyrion insists on finding them even under the most dire of circumstances. <br /> <br />Martin proves himself to be a master of writing vivid battle scenes as well as dialogue, as the epic battle of Blackwater comes to horrifying life.   <br /> <br />And through it all, while the Seven Kingdoms are torn apart bycivil war, the feuding warlords ignore two separate-yet-lethal looming threats -- the rise of the Dragonqueen in the lands across the sea, and the growing drumbeat of war rising in the North, where the undead Others are emerging from legend.   <br /> <br />Combining the mythic scope of Tolkein with the crisp writing style of Bernard Cornwell, Martin continues to build his masterpiece, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\"  While it may stress your patience with its 700-odd pages, a reader should definitely read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" before diving into \\"A Clash of Kings\\" -- this is a story much too rich to cut corners.  A must read!
B000002J0G|5.0|Testament has changed it's sound and lineup many times over the years. This album was the pinnacle of their carrer. After the disappointing \\"Souls of Black\\" and \\"The Ritual,\\" the band needed to fuel that fire burning deep inside of them.<br />Enter guitarist James Murphy and drummer John Tempesta, 2 outstanding musicians indeed. Now combine riff writing ferocity and tremendous creativity from Eric Petersen with some well placed and never before attempted death metal style throat techniques from Chuck Billy and you've got a miracle waiting to happen. All they had to do after that was step into the studio. Well, they did and the result was pure brilliance. If anyone is still debating on whether Alex Skolnick or James Murphy was a better guitarist, just listen to the solos in the title track and \\"Dog Faced Gods.\\" Alex is definitely a very good guitar player, but I think he and Murphy came from different schools. Alex was more jazzy but James I think fit the band better with his aggressive style. It was also nice to hear more complicated beats and fills, as opposed to the drum machine known as Louie Clemente. It's sad that they never did live up to the energy of this album afterward. Even \\"The Gathering,\\" with drummer Dave Lombardo (shame on you if you don't know who that is), bassist Steve DiGiorgio (Sadus, Death, Iced Earth) and the return of James Murphy, was subpar.<br />Not a single weak track on this one. A thrash classic that the band could be and should be most proud of.
0061015725|2.0|Read this one on a glowing recommendation from my CS 511 prof - which just goes to prove just how stupid the academic elite can be.  (Hey, I just proved Dr. Crichton's point and I didn't even have to create a race of super-powered machines to do it.)  I'm just glad I got it out of the Borders bargain rack instead of paying list for it.    WARNING - HERE BE SPOILERS...      1) The characters are flatter than lavash bread.  Jack is the put-upon saint, Julia is the career-chasing harridan, Ricky is the too-slick corporate type, and so on.  I've read better characterization in \\"Xena: Warrior Princess\\" fanfiction.    2) Oh-so-convenient plot twists.  The techie gurus involved in the Xymos project just happen to need an expert on evolutionary programming, which Jack just happens to have pioneered, so they just happen to fly him out to their top-secret research lab which just happens to be 160 miles from nowhere in the Nevada desert.  Sorry, that's just a little too much coincidence for my diet.  Oh, and by the way, Dr. Crichton:  You've done the science run amok thing many, many times before, and considerably better.  Find a new hobbyhorse, please.    3) Shoddy research - and since this is allegedly Crichton's forte, this upset me more than anything.    * Please pick an element - either the nanobots are carbon or silicon.  If they're C, there's no reason to eat the memory chips; if Si, no reason to eat bunnies/snakes/humans.  (Then too, if silicon was all they wanted, why only take the memory chips and leave the CPUs and such alone?)    * The 'bots should never have been able to survive their own manufacturing process.  We know from the first few chapters that a hospital MRI will kill them, and those typically run at 1-3 tesla.  A 33-tesla magnetic field, pulsed or not, would fuse any nanoscale metallic assemblage into unusable slag, to say nothing of frying pretty much any electronically based memory storage system.  (My Palm gets scrambled whenever I walk inside the 10-gauss limit of the chem building's NMR unit - that's only .001 T.)  All they would have had to do to kill the 'bots permanently would be to pulse that sucker a couple times.    * Phage viruses do ugly things to bacteria, but they wouldn't touch any non-bacterial organism - like, oh, a 'bot.    * Crichton's handling of computer programming hasn't improved any since \\"Jurassic Park.\\"  When Jack goes code-diving into the 'bots' programming, I was painfully reminded of the BS hacking displayed by the kids (it was Tim in the book, Lex in the movie.)    4) As a previous reviewer said, plot holes a T. rex could stroll through.  The last chapter (I refuse to call it a conclusion) raises more questions than it answers.  The just-happens-to syndrome also recurs in full force.    The only thing that saved this book from a complete pan?  One of the programmers is depicted as wearing a \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" T-shirt.  (For those who've never hung out with an anime otaku or watched late-night Cartoon Network, GITS is a famous Japanese animated drama, which began as a graphic novel and spawned two animated movies and a TV series.  It deals with a computerized world in which a rogue program evolves to sentience within the Internet, and how it interacts with the human world.  GITS was the inspiration for \\"The Matrix,\\" and it's also one of my favorite anime series.  Dumb, but true.)    Speaking of which, I think I'm going to go throw my copy of \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" into the DVD player.  At least Mamoru Oshii dealt with intelligent machinery, well, intelligently.
B0007P3582|1.0|50 sucks, he's gotten paranoid from the steroids, nas, fat joe, jada, shyne etc. are going to crush him!!
B0007O38F8|4.0|eh yo, right here, this album is hot. Why are people haters, i know its not as good as the earlier stuff, but hes tryna go back to it. The track wit Eminem is hot, the fast rapping, raw, you can't help but respect that. Most the tracks are decent, if you're lookin for some classic 50 cent, get this.
B0007NFL1S|5.0|50 cent has done it agian and oh my does it blow the roof off! I haven't heard a cd like 50's all year and that's including \\"the game\\" cd. This kid is sick wit it and he ain't playin on this album. He's back to his blasting and killing hard style from the street on this cd. I love it. The song \\"Gatman and Robbin\\" with Em is just flat out ridiculous both of them spit hot flame! NO DOUBT SON! And songs like \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" and \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" the beats on these tracks is hot, makes a dude wanna wile out and do a backflip. Basically, the cd is hot, its the real stuff straight from the streets! Brooklyn wassup, holla at the son, kid. 50's back at it again the cd is definitely worth the money. It's sick, son!
B00005OWEG|5.0|Just to let you know, I'm not a huge fan of war movies.  I checked out this classic film for the very first time and I was totally mesmerized with the dark character study of a war film.  The acting was top-notch, the story very moving, and the settings of the film very wonderful.  \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is one of those films where it will stay with you for a very long time after the ending of the film.
B0007O38F8|5.0|okay, someone here is being a moron with no life. quit judging this cd from the basis of \\"oh he fired Game.\\" okay, get over it, just because he dropped The Game, doesn't mean The Game is not gonna rap anymore, someone else will pick him up, Game is a hot rapper, leave that alone. <br /> <br />secondly, why is this cat making 50000 accounts just to diss 50, is he like The Game's momma or something? chill. <br /> <br />now, basing this album off of what it is, it's dope. he has WAAAAY better lyrics here than he did on Get Rich. he has definitely grown in terms of lyrical flow, not content. content wise it's the same 50, gangsta, drugs, sex, all that good stuff. the beats are so-so, it's not the best beats ever, but it's okay. he does credit to some of the beats by rapping over them, because there are honestly some really whack and terrible beats on here. not terrible because they sound bad, but because they are repetitive. i'm giving this CD 5 stars because that loser with 50000 accounts is downing this cd, so i have to try and make it higher. honestly, this cd is 4 stars.  <br /> <br />some gems, not all gems. the diss track isn't really that big of a deal, i was excited over this album because i thought 50 was gonna be ill on the disses like he always is, but he's w/e on piggy bank. i've heard him do better.  <br /> <br />buy this album, it's definitely worth it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until a few weeks ago when a friend recommended it to me. I will be grateful to that friend for the rest of my life because this movie is honestly the most amazing film I have ever seen in my life. Words cannot describe it. It was put together SO well, and Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is remarkable. It's extremely hard to understand. The first time I watched it I just sat there staring at the screen thinking... what just happened. But after watching it again, and looking up some info on the movie, it makes more sense. But I think the movie was put together perfectly. The mystery of it is what makes it so unforgettable. The soundtrack is amazing as well. Wouldn't change a thing... although the \\"smurf\\" scene was a little too raunchy for my taste. Still pretty funny though. :) That's another good thing about this movie. It's got drama, comedy, horror... everything. Watch it, and really pay attention, and you will NOT be disappointed. :) By the way... to those of you who \\"fell asleep\\" during this film - what does that have to do with anything?? I've fallen asleep during many awesome movies... call me crazy, but that COULD be a result of not getting much sleep??? Hmmm..
B000001EAQ|5.0|Happy Birthday to this undeniably brilliant and timeless work of Avant-Garde ART. This monumental masterpiece has been bashed even for the own band, POP is one of those albums that is extremely underappreciated, despite being much better than anything else the band has produced since ATYCLB. The truth is that POP, Zooropa and Achtung Baby are fifty times better than anything U2 has made since 2000 or will make for the next 10 downhill years.  <br /> <br />Whether you like POP or not, no one can deny the sheer talent of this album. This is such a spectacular achievement of Electrifying Rock, Awesome Soundscapes, Dark Emotions, Eccentric Electronica, European Musical complexity and Art. There is no other album out there that is like this one. <br /> <br />My personal favorites are 'Discotheque', 'Do You Feel Loved', 'Mofo', 'If God Will Send His Angels', 'Staring At The Sun', 'Gone', 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress' and 'Please'.  <br /> <br />Overall POP is the epitome of perfection. The last geniune great U2 album. It's a pity U2 are wasting their midlife years selling out behind dark glasses, behind their 80's and 90's legacy, Bono's long hair back, Rolling Stone magazine, Grammy Awards, IPod and Apple Tunes, cheap overhyped and overrated fake 'Classic' recycled albums, Super Bowl, Crappy unexciting Tours and 'Live' DVD's, etc. <br /> <br />HAPPY BIRTHDAY POP !!!!!. <br /> <br />
0671027387|5.0|With all of the new novels coming out, it is certainly hard to find a thriller that is actually thrilling. However, Dan Brown has again wowed audiences with his novel Deception Point.<br />  The novel is set in present day, in the middle of a close presidential election between The current President Herney and his opponent Senator Sexton. The main issue, NASA's overspending, has been hurting Herney's campaign to the point where failure is clearly on the horizon, So when Herney receives news that NASA has found a meteorite in the Arctic that contains fossils that prove the existence of extraterrestrial life, he is elated. However, when he sends scientists to research the find before he goes public with the announcement, the scientists encounter a startling discovery of their own: the meteorite is a fake. Chaos ensues, as the people who put the meteorite in place will do anything to protect the secret, and the scientists who uncovered the truth try to stop the press conference that will most likely end their President's career.<br />  This novel sheds light on the \\"darker\\" side of politics. The reader will learn just how far a candidate, or their supporters, will go to get that auspicious title put in front of their name.<br />  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone and everyone looking for a great read, but I must say that this novel provides an extremely in-depth look at politics and the scientific aspects involved in the discovery. It is not for someone looking for a simple beach read, but if you have the time and interest, Deception Point most definitely goes above and beyond the definition of a worthwhile read.

He's a collection agent for a loan shark, and tries, even then, to treat his clients right, giving them the chance to pay up.<br /><br />When Creed makes his offer to Rocky, Rocky realizes this is his door to freedom, to all he has dreamed of reaching. Creed, though, is the best, and Rocky knows it. He trains hard, but can't forget how good Creed is. His goal isn't to win; that seems unachievable. It is to go the distance, to last through every round. No one ever lasted that long with Creed.<br /><br />Subplots that help provide depth are his love interest with Adrian, perfectly played by Talia Shire, and Paulie's (Adrian's brother) temper and sense of feeling disenfranchised. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer, Mickey, is a stereotypically sour old man who talks in rough phrases from one side of his mouth who sees Rocky as the embodiment of his own failed dreams.<br /><br />Rocky's relationship with Adrian is classy. He is a gentleman, albeit simple, and even slept on the couch when Adrian stayed at his place. That kind of class is refreshing to see.<br /><br />Meredith, perhaps best known until this as the Penguin on the 1960s' Batman TV series, is a great compliment to Sylvester Stallone's Rocky, bringing a father-like wisdom and care to their relationship.<br /><br />Stallone's own comment on Rocky says it is, \\"All about: pride, reputation, and not being another bum in the neighborhood.\\" I saw it as an American dream. He worked hard, had a dose of luck, and when it mattered, was all heart.<br /><br />The music is as strong as the movie. High school bands played the \\"Rocky Theme\\" by Bill Conti for many years. Watching Rocky's workouts, especially the running and pushup scenes, is inspiring. Mixed with the music, you might catch yourself suiting up and hitting the streets for a few miles after the final credits roll.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Rocky.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com.

B0002UXBD6|5.0|I would like to start out this review by noticing something.  Don't you just love how nothing is about the music anymore?  I mean, people hate songs and musicians because they \\"sold out.\\"  If you weren't so f***ing obsessed with whether the things you like are popular or not, then you would get past it and see things for their true value. <br />Now that I'm beyond that, I think this CD is excellent.  I just can't get the songs out of my head.  Normally, that bothers me when I go around humming a tune for hours on end.  However, I didn't mind this.  In fact, I kind of make it a point to enjoy this CD. <br />I love Green Day.  They have such a great sound and the just keep getting better and better.  This is one of my favorite Green Day CDs.  Those who don't like it, don't listen to it.  I don't really care.  Just don't tell me about how \\"gay\\" I am for enjoying it. <br />I hope this isn't Green Day's last CD.  If it's not, I have little doubt that their future albums will be even better.
B000002H72|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time and must be in any serious music listener's collection.  There aren't many works that you don't skip the odd dodgy track on, but believe me this is one where you will lap up every one and come back for more!
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore is taking on the most powerfull regime in the world- America's government. Or to be more precise-Bush. This film is awared in Europe for the best documentary, but i bet Bushes made it sure that this year it doesn't get the Oscar! <br />Please watch it, it is funny and accurate....
B0000542DH|5.0|a great indictment of a seemingly ubiquitous american pop culture media that glorifies and perpetuates human vice (namely violence).  though the focused antagonist is the media, stone isn't too shy about pointing the finger at all of us as well; that we all maintain the \\"demon\\".  the sybolism is over-catered and pretty thickly blatant (stone, as always, would have done well to use a subtler approach), but his point is no doubt driven home.  and perhaps such a conspicuous rendering was intentional and serves more as a mirror of the overwhelming barrage and adornment of violence in this society (maybe not).  anyway, watch this movie.  hopefully someday it, and others like it, can be taught in schools and america can finally break free of its soul stomping capitalistic love of violence. i doubt it.  and i doubt it.  stone seems to suggest as the picture comes to a close that the \\"death\\" of media will be the death of violence.  and though that serves well cinematically, philosophically the problem is deeper and much more ingrained in us (a mere less-than-fortunate-consequence of evolution).  anyway and in any case, this is an achievement.  visually and artistically.   <br /> <br />.
B000002MY3|1.0|Who is Alanis Morissette tryin' to fool, we all know about her Tiffany-wannabe years, how could a person change so quickly, surely she was TOO HOT on her last album as the Debbie Gibson of Canada, it's obvious that this album was perfectly crafted by Mr. Glen Ballard, so they could sell us a supposed angry woman like Alanis was tryin' to be.  I don't understand it?....of course the music here is okay, but the autenticity of the performer not that much.  No wonder after this Alanis found it hard to return to the top of the charts, and she could never match the success of Jagged Little Pill, cos she simply didn't cooked this. <br />

6305696071|5.0|With enough said about it being such a fairy tale, all I have to say is that it is still a great movie. Sure there's no such thing as a beautiful, clean, dignified hooker with a good-head on her shoulders, nor a rich businessman that respects hookers. But who cares? Quite simply it's a fun movie.  I've probably watched Pretty Woman more than a million times over the years and still do not tire of it.   Why I like it so much, you ask?   Edward and Vivian have such a great chemistry between them. How can you resist?
B00009V7T2|2.0|Progressive?  Hardly.  There's absolutely nothing new on this album.  Essentially, this sounds just like At The Drive In except the songs (and song titles) are longer.  Oh, and totally unemotional too.  I forgot that part.  At The Drive In always sounded remarkably ferocious and physical...you know, like a BAND should.  The Mars Volta don't sound like a band, they sound like a science experiment.  Now, that could be cool if this album was truly experimental or if its chilliness served some greater musical purpose, but really, the Mars Volta strive for emotion and fail miserably here. This gets two stars cus that song \\"Inertiatic Esp\\" is still pretty cool and no matter how boring this album is, it's not as boring as the other post-At The Drive In band Sparta.  All in all, I guess this album means well and gets points for trying, but I'll just stick to \\"Relationship Of Command,\\" thank you very much.
0060763280|1.0|This book is full of plattitudes and short on real solutions one can put into practice in his or her life.<br /><br />An example, is the advise to \\"Own your own business,\\" which sounds good on the surface, but what about the 80% of new businesses that fail their first year?  And no other direction is given regarding owning one's own business.<br /><br />More hyperbole and old \\"country saying\\" permeate the book.  While these may make one \\"feel good\\" for a while and could provide some intrinsic motivation, any benefit is short-lived and quickly dies out once the \\"feel good\\" mentality wears off.<br /><br />The book reads like a commercial for the author's seminars and camps. If I could get people to pay me to read advertising for my business rather than me have to pay to advertise, I guess I would be a millionare also.  Maybe that is the real genius of the book.<br /><br />My advise: Skip the book and spend the $25 on a steak dinner.
B00005U2LM|3.0|The first two songs alone make this album miles ahead of \\"The W,\\" which was practically unlistenable except for a few songs. The rest of \\"Iron Flag\\" however, follows the same lazy, half-baked pattern of \\"The W.\\"  It's slightly better than that because of quality songs like \\"Uzi\\" and \\"One Of These Days,\\" but for the most part this is the same lazy, erratic Wu Tang Clan we've grown accoustumed to in the years since their Enter The Wu Tang/Liquid Swords/Cuban Linx glory days.  RZA needs to spend more time crafting solid beats and stop relying on gimmicks, GZA and Inspekta Deck need to get on the mic more, and the whole group really needs to get together and work on recapturing the energy, intelligence, songwriting skill, and attitude that made them great in the first place.  That will probably never happen again, but we can dream, right?
B0007O38F8|5.0|Why are you still reading?  I just told you to go buy Krayzie Bone because it is the sleeper album of this year.  If you think Bone hasn't been hot since the mid 90's your Krayzie.  If my word isn't good enough for you go download \\"Don't Know Why\\" and I guarentee you will go buy the rest of the cd.  Since Balla Records refuses to promote his album I going to take it upon myself.  Clearly after 262 reviews in one day 50 doesn't need any promoting.  But I will say this: WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE MASSACRE DON'T COMPARE IT TO GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN'.  Listen to the album as if your hearing 50 for the first time.  If you compare it to GRODT the whole time you will only be dissappointed because you will be waiting for tracks that sound like \\"What up Gangsta\\", \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"Many Men\\", ect...  The beats are amazing and 50 is probably the catchiest man alive so you need to let the album grow on you.  Anyone that reviewed the cd after one or two listens and wrote a review you need to ignore because their opinion is worthless.  I've had the cd for over a week via the internet and it gets better after every listen.  I am also going to go out and buy the cd because I don't burn classics.  If you don't think this cd is a classic wait six months and look at the billboard charts and see \\"50 Cent - The Massacre\\" still in the top five.   <br /> <br />P.S. As with all 50 Cent releases, if you are a 50 hater or G-Unit hater don't listen to the cd once and try to write intelligently about it.  Go write poetry or watch the O'reilly factor, whatever it is you whiners do when your not complaining and save your two page piss and moan reviews for one of your two friends...G G G G G G G G G - UNIT!!!
B0000C8AVR|5.0|I've been wanting to write a Dylan review for a long time since he's one of my very favorite artists, but i wasn't sure how to approach it.  Dylan's music has been analyzed, argued over, referenced, memorialized, criticized, misunderstood, and loved for years and i don't know if i could really say anything that hasn't been said before.  I guess I should start by talking about the first time I heard \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" because that, to me, really sums this album up.  I don't have a good story about the circumstances around it; i randomly decided to download it one day when i was in high school.  What i can tell you about, though, is just how much it blew me away.  Dylan's intricate, funny, imaginative word-play and storytelling created a whole world within the song itself, but that wasn't even the most amazing thing.  The best part of the song is the performance.  Dylan spits his words out rapid fire while the band clatters behind him and he bashes out a simple rhythm on his guitar, slightly off beat with the rest of the band.  The mix of the words, the delivery and the music behind them gets me everytime.  Dylan delivers his words like he invented the english language and he and his band play like they invented rock n roll.  It's as incredible as it is difficult to fully describe.  And that's just one song.  The rest of the album is almost as great.  \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" has a great organ part (Al Kooper is awesome) and wonderful, wonderfully bitter lyrics.  \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" mixes that bitterness with a deep sense of understanding and acceptance and sums up the feelings around an accrimonious break up perfectly.  \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry,\\" besides having one of the best song titles ever, is a great piece of laid back blues and \\"From A Buick 6\\" is the most furious garage rock Dylan ever recorded.  The title song has a nice siren-like kazoo and and typically great, surrealistic lyrics.  \\"Ballad Of A Thin Man\\" is a dark, possibly self-deprecating character study with almost gothic piano behind it, and \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is a vivid depiction of an American in Juarez, Mexico.  \\"Desolation Row\\" closes the album on a truly epic note.  I know this review has been rambling, gushing, and borderline incomprehensible so let me sum it up right here: front to back, this album is brilliant. Don't deny yourself the pleasure of listening to it.  And now for the Dylan newbies, other top albums by the man are: \\"The Freewheeling Bob Dylan,\\" \\"The Times They Are A-Changing,\\" \\"Another Side Of,\\" \\"Bringing It All Back Home,\\"  \\"Blonde On Blonde,\\" \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" \\"Blood On The Tracks,\\" and of course, \\"The Basement Tapes\\"  I know that's a lot, but believe me, once you hear this, you'll want to get em all.
B0007O38F8|4.0|After a little more then a 2 year break since his classic \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" 50 is back with a good album, but not as good as his other 3 solo's.  Why people hate on this is beyond me, just becasue it doesn't match up to a classic doesn't make it garbage, and half the reviews tallk absolutely nothing about the album.  It has 21 songs, 1 is a classic, but I'd say 4 are ok, 3 are near classics and the others are good, but it could have been a classic as a 16 or 17 song album.  Production is handled by 12 different people, so the souds vary from track to track. Eminem & Scott Storch each do 3 songs, C Styles & Bang Out, Needlez, Dr. Dre, Hi-Tek and Jonathan R each do 2 songs, and Buckwild, Cool & Dre, Sha Money XL, Cue Beats & Disco D each do 1 song.  He gets on a few people like always, and has a death certificate on the inside with Irv Gotti's name on.  Guests are few and are G-Unit members and Eminem as well as Olivia & Jamie Foxx.  He has his radio friendly songs on here as well as his husling, dirty, and gangsta songs.  A good album to have for his fans but don't expect another \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\", the sound is a little different as is his style on this one.    #2 - 8 (about his hood)  #3 - 7.5 (good beat, bad rapping)  #4 - 8.5  #5 - 8.5 (dissin Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Nas, and Shyne)  #6 - 9 (f/ eminem -- upbeat Batman theme sample is used as the beat)  #7 - 7 (f/ olivia -- gets overplayed for an ok song)  #8 - 9 (good beat)  #9 - 9 (good beat)  #10 - 9.5 (good beat)  #11 - 9 (relaxing good beat talking in first person as heroin)  #12 - 8 (another relaxing beat)  #13 - 7.5  #14 - 7.5  #15 - 9.5 (good beat)  #16 - 9.5 (good beat -- f/ Tony Ya Yo)  #17 - 10 (CLASSIC --- relaxing good beat)  #18 - 8 (f/ jamie foxx -- only 2 verses)  #19 - 8 (only 2 verses)  #20 - 8 (f/ olivia -- only 2 verses)  #21 - 8.5 (only 2 verses)  #22 - 8 (f/ Game, Lloyd Banks, Tony Ya Yo, Young Buck)    Curtis Jackson -- b. 7/6/76 -- Jamaica Queens, NY  check all my reviews
B00000I14Z|5.0|Mingus composed some of the most amazingly catchy, vibrant, emotional songs you'll ever hear for this album and his band absolutely slays. \\"Better Git Hit In Yo Soul\\" is a blast from start to finish with elements of big band and gospel coming right out to slap staid, classy jazz fans in the face and make them dance.  Those put off by the intensity of that song will be more at home with the gentle ballad \\"Goodby Porkpie Hat\\" which swoons along beautifully.  Most of the songs fall somewhere in between those extremes with \\"Boogie Stop Shuffle,\\"  \\"Bird Calls,\\"  and the carnivalesque \\"Fables Of Faubus\\" being my particular favorites.  This is not only Mingus's most accessible album, but one of his very best.  As both a bassist and a songwriter/composer, Mingus is truly one of the greats and his genius is on full display right here.
B00005JLEX|5.0|One of the funniest shows ever is on DVD!  This is the one show i can honestly say there is not a single bad episode.  If you've seen this show its not hard to understand why they say its based on Nothing.  Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer are always getting into predicaments over the most trivial things!  The second season on this dvd has unforgetable episodes like the one where George goes to tell off a pregnant woman at her own baby shower and the one where Jerry offends an old Polish woman by saying he hates people who had ponys while growing up.  If you love Seinfeld you've probably seen all of these but buy this dvd set anyway it has excellent picture and has tons of extras!
B000002I4W|3.0|Most of the reviewers here are trying to discount the ridiculous notion that this album that this album is \\"difficult.\\"  And I agree with them.  This album is accessible to the point of being tame.  Its historical significance and influence is truly undeniable, but compared to Coleman's later recordings and the Coleman-influenced work of Sun Ra and late-period Coltrane, this just sounds dull and academic.  I gave this three stars for \\"Lonely Woman\\" alone because truly, that song is undeniable, but the rest of the album puts me to sleep.  Jazz for the library, not the night club.
0440213525|4.0|This is a page-turner of a book.  It's not exhausting like \\"The Firm,\\" but continually interesting and the characters are lovable.<br /><br />This is the story of an 11-year old boy who happens upon a suicide and confession about mob activities.  The mob doesn't want the boy to repeat what he now knows.  The boy has few resources; he lives in a trailer park with a single mom and a little brother.  He finds a middle-aged, chain smoking lawyer lady who helps to protect him while the system tries get what he knows out of him and the mob tries to stop him altogether.<br /><br />Very well written and great character development.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|'West Side Story' is one of the greatest musicals to come out in the past 50 years. The story is clearly taken from ' Romeo and Juliet' and put into mordan setting ( basically 1960's ). The Sharks ( Puerto-ricans ) and the Jets ( Whites ) are two rival gangs in 1960 New York. When Tony ( a gang member of The Jets) falls in love with Maria ( sister of lead gang member of The Sharks ), all trouble falls through, and leads to a saddening ending. <br />      <br />        The picture quality is good, but the starting scene at the gym is a little fuzzy. But the sound quality on this DVD, is wonderful and sometimes you feel like as though you are there. The songs and dancing sequence are always wonderful like usual, including the in-famous 'I feel pretty,' ' America', ' Somewhere ' etc. Great movie for children of all age and adults.  <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 is just like totally like soooo totally wack, yo! Like, 50, like totally just like is so mad wack, word is like bond!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Man, the originals were so boring.  I'm glad they've been so thoroughly jazzed-up with extra effects and whatnot.  And for those who disagree, you still have your precious little plastis figurines to cuddle with every night, and keep trying, maybe someday you really will use the force to mind-trick an actual female into going out with you.  Until then, you can hide your shame behind a bobo-fett mask and pine away, pretending that the real problem is some new effects added to some 70's b-movie about aliens, robots, rubber masks and spaceships.  Oh, and magic powers.  Don't forget that.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Ok all these haters dissing this cd, dissing 50...I have a question.  Are you guys all rappers? If so why aren't you selling as much as 50....I think its maybe jealousy on your part. Stop hating on 50 just because he made it and you didnt. And for that sorry fool that created like 50 accounts just to bash 50 needs to get a life. This album is not as good as \\"Get Rich\\" but it is good, although I don't like him dissing Jada, and Fat Joe because those guys are both good rappers and its not there fault that 50 hates Ja so much. The hating needs to stop as it is just making you guys look like envious rappers who never made it. Just my opinion.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|This is a very exciting movie.  You won't feel bored from the beginning to the end.  It has a simple story, good acting.  I give 75-80 marks.  I recommend this movie to most of the people here.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was never the type of person that would sitdown and watch a 'series'.  There are tons of TV shows, but very few interest me enough to sit and watch.  One day a friend of mine introduced me to the Firefly DVD set, and after some nagging I finally watched the first episode.  I was suprised, the quality was incredible compared to the quick glances I've seen of other shows.  The characters also seemed to have a depth and a reality that really interested me. <br /> <br />After my initial viewing of episode one, I actually asked my friend if I could come over and watch the next episode!  Something I've never done!  Right now it's been a weekly ritual.  Every week we get together and watch a new episode, and we're currently on disk 3.  Every episode just interests me in the characters more and more.  There's something about the crew of the Serenity that just makes you feel like cheering for them.  Even though they're such a mismatched bunch of folks, they somehow fit together.  I know there's only one disk left after this, but I ask myself how TV stations can dump this show?!  It's one of the best TV series I've seen period.  I found out more information about Firefly's creator, and was suprised to find out that he also made Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I never really cared for that show personally, but Firefly is something different.  It 's really something special, and I'm glad to hear a movie is coming out.  I'm certainly going to watch it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|My husband & I first saw Gavin DeGraw last year as an opener for BNL and I was hooked! He is awesome in concert, going back & forth from guitar to piano, in mid-song! A couple of songs are kinda kitchy (Chemical Party) and are definitely for the college crowd, but on the whole, he is just a talented artist and I can't wait for his next album! I wish they'd play some other songs from the album on the radio. \\"Chariot\\" is my favorite. Definitely not a manufactured sound.
B000001FTQ|4.0|I'm still a bit mystified that this is in print in the same format.  It's really just an EP, and has about as much music as a maxi-single.  They should really drop the price or add some more tracks.<br /><br />Nevertheless...<br /><br />Here we have an officially released live version of Bad.  Note that this is not the Live Aid version.  It's still very good, much more pumped up than the studio version (excellent on its own, though).  The sequencer and synth effect (practically inaudible on the studio version) is loud and clear, and the band proved they could take Eno's tinkering out on stage and make it work.<br /><br />A Sort of Homecoming is a bit quieter than the rumbling original, and in excellent quality.<br /><br />The other two tracks are outtakes from The Unforgettable Fire, or rather, they're B-sides from the British singles, thrown on here to make an enjoyable EP.  Love Comes Tumbling is a quiet, somber track, but very well done.  Sounds like a drum machine in use, the echo effects are kept to a minimum, and Bono's voice is strong.  Three Sunrises is the opposite--one of the most boisterous, sing-out-loud U2 songs ever.  Excellent.<br /><br />Recommended, for sure.  Tracks every fan should seek out, though it's a bit pricey for 20 minutes of music.

B00006LLLN|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD and I've owned it for over a year since seeing the CMT broadcast. We are experiencing history...believe it! There is rarely a collection of musicians this talented for ANY generation.
B0007O38F8|2.0|this CD had alot of pottential and was over hyped. the first thing i realized when listening to this cd was, 50 cent can't carry a cd by himself, a song or two sure. it's fairly common knowledge that 50 is probly the worst lyrically in g-unit. this cd show's it more then any, even tony yayo kills him on his own track. compared to the game's documentary, lloyd banks's hunger for more and young bucks straight out of cashville this CD is by far inferior. this album also seems a little to pop rap for 50, yeah his last album had some club hits. but i don't remember some chick singing the hook. he should have stuck with the west coast tried and true formula to success. nate dogg on the hook, and feature 16 bars from other rappers on almost every song.  <br /> <br />all in all the cd is ok, but i wouldn't got past that, just ok
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna may not have the best voice, but she is someone who puts her heart and soul in each of her songs. This cd starts off with \\"I Want You\\" a remake of the Marvin Gaye's classic and she actually holds her own here. There is also another R&B remake, \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" and again, she sings the song with passion. Another one of my favorites is \\"One More Chance\\", this song features Madonna with a guitar and some strings and she convincing as heck. But the song that really surprised me was \\"Something To Remember\\". It was this song alone that made me get her \\"I'm Breathless\\" cd. Who knew that Madonna could sing torch songs of the 1940s? I also LOVE her \\"You'll See\\" song. There is something sad and yet strong about her performance...she sings it like she knows what she is talking about. Despite this cd being slow, it holds your attention because the songs are so different from each other. Pick this cd up today.
B0002X314C|5.0|As described by the dictionary: having many facets or aspects. John Legend certainly falls under that definition as well as many others. He is just not a singer, songwriter, but a musician as well. His music has the rare combination on braun and beauty. It's heavy enough for you to stand on, yet light enough to carry you away. And that's how music should be. That's why this debut stands superior to so many others. John Legend gets it right the first time. <br /> <br />

0670033375|4.0|Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse - How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" is a good discription of how people's choices result in the success or failure of their societies. Unfortunately the collapses he describes are of small societies on the fringes of the habitable world. He doesn't investigate the really big collapses, like the Roman Empire, which were mostly caused by external invasions. And his view is somewhat US-centric. For instance, he doesn't notice that Montana's big problem is not that it is short of resources, but that it borders on three Texas-sized Canadian provinces with vastly greater resources. Montana prospered when it had the biggest copper deposits on the planet but now all it has left is big holes in the ground, and everything else it produces is much more plentiful and cheaper north of the border. His last example, California is a really good example of really bad choices. California did well when it was relatively empty, but now it is populated to European densities. He considers the problem to be overpopulation, but the density is fine if you adopt a European lifestyle - live in small townhouses or apartments, take public transportation to work, and high-speed rail to nearby cities. However, it is too high if people want to drive big SUV's enormous distances down the freeways. The problem is that, like the Greenland Norse, Californians would rather die than change.<br /><br />As I was taking Calgary's wind-powered electric train home from work today, I considered the choices we have made. While we here north of Montana have vastly greater oil reserves than are left in the US, we find it more efficient to sell them to the US than use them ourselves. That way the air pollution goes to California and the wealth goes to Canada. As Diamond says, it's an opportunity to learn from other people's mistakes.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|All the elements are there; the shredding, the hooky sing along choruses, the immortal size riffs, the super tight rhythm work, the best voice in metal (sounds fantastic), the clear coherent drum thunder, and most of all the great songs. Basically; AOR is Painkiller 2.<br /><br />I recommend to all Priest fans; you will not be disappointed by this one! And the bonus DVD was also excellent! Thanks Priest!<br /><br />KaaosMachine
B0007P3582|5.0|You really have to listen to the whole cd more than once to appreciate it....I was expecting the same beats as the first, so the first time I heard it I was disappointed...listening to it a second and third time around, I really liked this cd...my favorite songs were : \\"God Gave Me Style\\", \\"So Amazing\\", \\"This is 50\\", and \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\"...The beats are different from Get Rich, but they are different and sound fresh...I think 50 cent set this cd up as follows, first the raw street songs and club bangaz, ending off with clean, positive songs with \\"God Gave Me Style\\", in which 50's basically talking about being blessed, and at the same time giving a positive vibee,  and \\"So Amazing\\" , in which he talks about that one special girl. This shows that 50 cent can rhyme grimey and aggressive, and switch it up to something positive...He also broadens his topics...\\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is something different as 50 rhymes from the cocaine's perspective, and what it does to the abuser...50 brings somethin different with this song...It's still grimey and rough, but it does send a strong message..As for the beats, they were real different and funky for the most part..It sounds as if some of the beats were influenced by Indian and Asian music and instruments...Real fresh and new...different from the norm, but still tight...As for it being better than the first, I wouldn't say that...Although he still keeps it as rough and grimey as he wants, he still covers other topics like he did in Get Rich or Die Trying, just different topics, and in a different way..It's like comparing apples and oranges...It's a great cd, and you really have to listen to it more than once to appreciate it...To all those people who are pissed after listening to it the first time, go back and listen to it again...ITS TIGHT...YOU'LL LOVE IT
B000002OCP|5.0|a friend bought this album when it came out...and we damn near wore the grooves out... <br /> <br />sadly...that original vinyl went up in smoke in 1970... <br /> <br />if for nothing else but to hear \\"Herbert Harper's Free Press News\\" again...i had a cassette tape dub made from an old copy of the vinyl lp... <br /> <br />since it's release by MCA...i've bought two copies...one for myself...and one for the friend who bought it in 1968... <br /> <br />no...contrary to the beliefs of some...Muddy did not think that the album was awful... <br /> <br />listen to the man...his in his prime...and the FORCE of his vocals are better than anything he did before or after... <br /> <br />and...he's having fun... <br /> <br />no...the man was a consumate artist and there's no way in hell anyone forced him to record \\"Electric Mud\\" <br /> <br />if he did depreciate it in later years...i think it's because he had so many misguided individuals telling him it was no good... <br /> <br />so where else are you going to listen to such a heart-felt rendition of \\"The Same Thing\\"? <br /> <br />i'm giving it ten stars... <br />
0380778556|5.0|I always read the reviews at Amazon before I spend money and shipping to buy a book.  When reading the reviews for this book I was pissed.  I was reading through the reviews and thought, \\"WOW I've got to read this!\\"  Then I got to Barbara's review and she ruined it for me.  Why on earth would you spoil the book for potential readers by giving away the ending??  Barbara defends her actions......Bull!  There is no defense!  I just hate it when someone tells the ending of a book or movie. Suffice it to say...I'm not going to buy the book now!
B0007O38F8|4.0|Let me preface my review by stating that I am by no means a big fan of 50 Cent. However, I must admit that Get Rich or Die Trying was an amazing debut album. Historically speaking, all rap artists have been challenged in their ability to produce sophomore albums that are equal to the debuts that brought them fame. To his credit Fiddy doesn't try to match Get Rich punch for punch. Instead, he opts for a greater variety in production, and flips his flow to match the array of aggressive sounds. 50 is far from a lyrical genius, however it isn't what he says, but how he says it. He has mastered the art of kickin' catchy choruses. The Massacre has plenty of head-bop sing along crisp tunes. With 20 cuts not including the intro, the album may be a little too long, and the collection would have benefited by addition through a bit of subtraction. All-in-all this album is far from disappointing, even for a marginal 50 Cent fan such as myself.
B000683VI4|5.0|The movie begins with  a man reading from a faded notebook to a woman in a nursing home. The story he tells follows the lives of two North Carolina teens from very different worlds, Noah the son of a poor farmer, and Allie the daughter of a rich family from the northeast who summer in Noah's hometown. Despite their economic differences, after much persistence on the part of Noah, Noah and Allie spend one summer together before they are separated, first by her parents, who were disgusted that she fell for a man like Noah, and then by WWII. <br /> <br />After the soldiers come home, everything is different. Despite the letters Noah wrote Allie everyday when he was away, Allie is engaged, to a man more in sync with her parents wishes, and Noah lives alone with his memories in a 200-year-old house he lovingly restores. (The house he promiesed to buy for Allie and fix up that summer) But when Allie sees an article in a local paper about Noah's handiwork, she knows that she's got to find him and make a decision once and for all about the path her life and her love must take.... <br /> <br />And so they meet again... and the truth about Allie's family comes out... Allie, all these years, has believe that Noah forgot about her, having not recieved any of the letters he sent. Come to find out Allie's mother took all the letters from the mail and hid them away before Allie saw them (we later learn this is because Allie's mother had a similar relationship with a poor man when she was younger).... but now things are complicated... Allie is engaged to a man who loves her so much, and whom her parents aprove of... <br /> <br />Noah has loved Allie for all the years they were seperated. He could have been with other women but he never had the desire to, Allie owned his heart... Now that she is back in his life he does not want to let her go... <br /> <br />What will Allie do? <br /> <br />This story is amazing. The power of the love is felt through the incredible cast of actors.The emotions are so powerful and the characters so full of life. I am usually not such a sap for romantic movies but this one was different. I cried and cried... in the theatre! So ladies wear that waterproof mascara for this one.  <br />
B000005HFH|5.0|The music of Chet Baker is nothing short of amazing.  No disrespect to Mr. Miles Davis, John Coltrane, or Charlie Parker, but for me, no other jazz maestro can evoke a strange mutual feeling of lament and happiness as Chet Baker. Listening to this cd makes me feel like I'm in the smoky backroom of a great jazz bar in San Francisco, sitting next to Jack Kerouac.  Don't get me wrong, Miles Davis was brilliant but can be a bit flashy and overly abstract.  With Chet, what you hear is what you get-a lamenting love fool still waiting to get over that one girl.  For me, the brilliance is in the music's innocence.  It is naive charm at its purist.  No other jazz artist can come close to this innocence.  For critics of Baker's voice, I always like to compare it to that of John Lennon's.  It is what it is.  For me, it is both powerfully haunting and sweet at the same time- no other jazz vocalist has this trait. He does not possess the prowess of Nat King Cole or Billie Holliday, but neither of those two has ever made me shed a pearl drop like only Chet can.   <br /> <br />Thank you Mr. Baker for leaving us the best legacy any jazz maestro can leave behind-your incredible music <br />

B0007MVXQG|4.0|Just a quick note here, the deluxe version gives you two discs - one CD and one DVD and is easier to handle. It also has better inside packaging artwork. If you don't mind putting out the extra dollars, it's definitely a better set. Now on with the story...<br /><br />I've loved Judas Priest for a long time now, so I was hot to pick this up on release day. While it is far from flawless, it's the kind of classic heavy metal that proves what so many of the current crop of heavy metal bands completely miss - just because you can play loud and fast, it doesn't make you heavy. \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" (what a classic album title!) delivers that message with accelerant.<br /><br />From the ascending guitars and Rob Halford's inimitable scream that tears the album open for \\"Judas Is Rising,\\" it's clear that the band is in stride. Tipton and Downing blaze through classic riffs in such standard fare like \\"Demonizer\\" and \\"Hellrider,\\" and there is plenty of the kind of badman posturing that got the old PMRC in cold sweats back in the day. Especially good is \\"Revolution,\\" the kind of in-your-face rock that made \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" an anthem.<br /><br />\\"Angel Of Retribution's\\" other big surprise is \\"Angel,\\" a tragic love ballad that could easily be attributed to Rob Halford's personal orientation (this guy's more a gay icon that anyone wants to give him credit for!), and it strikes a personal note on an album that is otherwise filled with aggression (\\"Revolution\\"), testosterone (\\"Judas Rising\\") and mythology (the overlong and album low point, \\"Loch Ness\\").<br /><br />For the bonus DVD materials, the live cuts are all great snapshots of the band's 2004 tour. High points are the acoustic version of Joan Baez' \\"Diamonds And Rust\\" and Halford delivering \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" from a motorcycle. The \\"Reunited\\" documentary part is fun to watch, but not memorable. But all in all, Judas Priest is delivering the goods.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I can't wait to see them live opening with this song! Can anybody give me an example  of a 30-year old band  coming back and delivering one of its best albums!  The  younger metal bands SHOULD LISTEN to this album- Judas Priest sound younger than the majority of the new bands which  concentrate on technical virtuosity (if any) and not giving a damn soul about the music! This is especially true  for the  most American and Canadian bands from the last 10-15 years which sound  so cold, trivial and void of emotion. There is so much power and passion in each Priest song!   <br />\\"Judas Rising\\" is one of the best songs Priset have ever made. <br />\\" Deal with the devil\\" is a classical heavy rocker  reminding of  Halford's \\"Resurrection\\" album.   <br />\\"Revolution\\"-one of my favorites-monumental, it carries the glory of \\"Heavy Duty\\"/Defenders of the Faith\\", but it's even better. <br />\\"Worth Fighting For\\"-ironically, not a perfect song,  reminds me of my least favorite Priest albums (\\"Point of Entry\\"/\\"Turbo\\"), but I respect their decision to put it on the album, because it contains elements of everything they have done the last 30 years. <br />\\" Demonizer\\", Wheels of Fire\\", \\"Hellrider\\"-could have been taken from \\"Painkiller\\", with surprising operatic chants from Rob Halford on the third song. Magnificent, totally stunning Priest <br />\\"Angel\\"-one of Priest's  finest ballads. Beautiful vocals from Rob (not like  Demolition's \\"Lost And Found\\", which was dreadful) <br />Eulogy/Lochness- a majestic,  epic closure of the album with heavy guitars and supreme vocals from Rob. Reminder of the   prog-metal first  Priest albums from the seventees.  <br />Overall, one of the best  metal albums you have heard in years and one of Priest's best! Ten stars!

B0007P3582|1.0|This was a horrible piece of work. It sounds like he just tried to get the roughest beats he could find, take 15 min. to write a few verses and said hey put it on the album.  It was just an all around horrible album and it was boring on top of that. I fell asleep listening to this. The only bring spot is his duet with Olivia on \\"So Amazing\\" which brings me to my next point. Didn't he just get on Ja Rule for singing with Ashanti yet he goes and does the same thing with Olivia. Well, just know that Ja Rule and Ashanti did it better. You'd be better off going out and buying his first album again and pretending like he re-released it or something cuz The Massacre is a very good description for this album.
B0007O38F8|4.0|I think most people can agree that this isnt as good as GRODT. But give credit were credit is due. This CD will be one of if not the best rap albums of the year. Every song is hot and his lyrics are sick, espceially on Baltimore love thing, piggy bank, hate it or love it and the list goes on and on. Mad props to 50. <br />GGGGGGGGGGG-unit!!!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This is simply one of the best \\"rock\\" albums of any year.  So much pap is being sold as \\"music\\" today that I fear that the oldie-but-goodie classic \\"Rock & Roll Will Never Die\\" was wrong after all.  If you want to hear where rock came from and the direction in which it should go, buy this album (CD) now.  My experience has been that when we listen to European and, in this case, Australian rock artists we listen to the best of American music repeated and paid homage to 5 to 10 years after it fizzled here.  Sweden has amazing rock music currently.  Americans tend to have a short memory for what constitutes great rock music especially since the mind numbing hip hop/rap catastrophe began to corrupt \\"real\\" band music.  Loud bass, ignorant/foul ramblings praised as ghetto \\"poetry\\" by patronizing critics and fans does not music make.  Fortunately we still \\"breed\\" bands like Train, Matchbox Twenty, Fountains of Wayne (?) et.al.  Also, Aerosmith continues to be relevant even after its drug dazzed brain-cell killing past. Listen to Jet and learn what U.S. rock music should sound like.
B0007P3582|5.0|Seriously, this cd will grow on you...I am a huge G-Unit fan, and this disc is right up there with anything they have all put out...even \\"Get Rich ORD\\"...its packed with classics, and is a bit harder than 50's first disc...Track #4 could be possibly the best song 50's ever done IMHO...I honestly got a leaked copy of this cd a week ago, and it didnt blow me away at first, but as days went on, I am at the point where nothing else even interests me to listen to....i went and bought the real copy of the disc today, simply so i could have the best sound quality...I will tell you, if you like 50 and G-Unit, you'll love this disc, its a true classic IMO....50 is still on top of the rap game, and i dont see him leaving any time soon....

B00005HYHB|4.0|I originally bought this album in 1977, and after having nearly worn out my Dark side of the Moon and Wish you were here albums, wasnt sure what Animals would be like. <br /> <br />There had been rumblings from the media that it would be vastly different, and indeed it was. Somewhat more commerical than expected it still had tremendous guitar work fron David Gilmour. <br /> <br />Many reviews bag this album as being troubled by internal band rifts. This may well be the case, however I am more intersted in the music. <br /> <br />It was a little difficult to listen as the style was nothing akin to earlier albums, but I have since come to appreciate this work for what it is, a very tongue in cheek putdown of the political scene of the day. <br /> <br />The music is as unique to Pink Floyd as ever and the blend of tracks is excellent. This album should be a must in any Floyd lovers album collection.

B0007N1AI6|4.0|I've never been a devoted Judas Priest fan.  I bought  \\"Angel of Retribution\\" just because I was curious as to what this bunch of 50-yr-olds would sound like in this day and age.   <br /> <br />And I have to say that  \\"Angel of Retribution\\" offers some amazing heavy metal material to satisfy any Heavy Metal fan out there.  I've been playing the CD nonstop since I got it and it really gets better with every spin. <br /> <br />There is heavy stuff like `Judas Rising', `Demonizer' and the amazing `Hellrider'.  There is some good' ole classic metal like `Deal w/ the Devil' and `Wheels on Fire'.  Experimental metal like `Revolution', `Worth Fighting For' and a beautiful ballad called `Angel'.  And then the CD ends with a classic metal 13-minute operatic (either you'll like it or you don't) song called `Loch ness'. <br /> <br />Some may not like this CD but consider this, for ANY band that has survived 30+ years and still sound this fresh, powerful and energetic, \\"Angel of Retribution\\" deserves a buy.   <br />
B00006690G|5.0|This 3rd album by Slim could be his best, but I can't really decide because this has alot of good songs, but I liked the ton of controversial statements on his first two CDs, and its not close to as controversial on this CD.  It easily beats Encore, but that's not that hard. I understand how hard it would be to make Encore, but it was still terrible.  Here's my song by song review.    Curtains Up: A pretty good start although just a skit.     White America: 4/5 Great opening track, very controversial but the anger in it stands out and sounds great.  I can listen to this song over and over. This song is not a masterpiece though.    Business: 3/5 An okay song, it gets repetitive pretty quick because of the repeating sirens in the beat and the rapping isn't GREAT.    Cleanin' Out My Closet: 5/5 I can't find any faults in this song, there is alot of emotion and sadness in this song.  The video for this song (not included) is great too. This song really flows well and gets its point out.    Square Dance: 4/5 This song is pretty good, its not great but it is really catchy and a good combination of anger, happiness, adrenaline, and his \\"kiss my ass\\" attitude in this song.    The Kiss: Cool skit, it sets the stage for the next song.  Soldier: 4/5 Marshall trying to be gangster, its a good song but none of this is real and thats what most of his songs are about.    Say Goodbye Hollywood: 3/5 A song about him starting to finish up his career and how he is trying to balance his life.  Not great, but it is kind of catchy.    Drips: 4.8/5 This song has so many swears and sexual subject matter, it's taken off the edited version, but I DONT CARE. The chorus is great and so is Slim's verse.  The only reason this didn't get 5 is because Obie's verse isnt really that intresting, catchy, and its just about him having sex.    Without Me: 4/5 Really catchy and cool beat, nice work with the voice changes, a very good song just not great.    Paul Rosenburg: A skit about Shady running around firing his gun off and his manager trying to stop him.  Pretty funny.    Sing For The Moment: 5/5 Great flow, good point, and the Aerosmith excert for the hook fits in perfectly.    Superman: 6/5 GREAT SONG!  A slow and fast song about his relationship with women, it has a great hook, flow, and beat.  I think it is easily the best song on the album.    Halie's Song: 4/5 A really touching song about Em's daughter, Halie Jade Mathers, and how she is keeping him together.    Steve Berman: A pretty pointless skit where Slim kills one of his sales reps.    When The Music Stops: 3/5 D-12 song, kind of hard to tell what this song is about but I know there isnt much point.    Say What You Say: 4.5/5 Really good song, Dr. Dre saved this song with his amazing beat and his raps in this song.    'Till I Collapse: 3.9/5 An okay song, the background is pretty good but the rapping is only okay.     My Dad's Gone Crazy: 5/5 Great song about how Em is crazy and nothing can save him.  Really fast and cartoonish. Flows nicely.    Curtains Close:  Funny skit about Ken Kaniff imitating \\"Without Me\\" where he sings \\"Ken is back, tell some men, rub my back, rub my back, rub my back\\"    This CD gets a five, even though it isn't perfect. I bought it in 2003, (not really an Eminem fan), I listened to it, the in depth songs like Cleaning out My Closet were the most interesting.  I now am an Eminem superfan, not a groupie, but I'm like a Stan without all the suicide because of this album.  I'm still listening to it 2 years later, and I have listened to it SO much. Definetely buy this album. I would pay 30 dollars for it, its so good as with all his albums with the exception of Encore.  This CD is hard to compare to his first two, because it is still great, but doesnt have all of the controversy and wit from the first two, or the craziness or murder talk like the song Kim on the MMLP. BUY IT THOUGH!
B00005YU1O|3.0|'Waking Life' would be more interesing, seen in the context of the up and down and up of the career of director Richard Linklater, one of the most innovative filmmakers in America.  Before making this film, he experienced a very bitter taste of Hollywood and a commercial failure with 'The Newton Boys' which was attacked, or at best ignored, by the fans and critics alike.  Then he went back to his indie origin, and this film is born. <br /> <br />[VIRTUALLY PLOTLESS] The film follows a young man's spiritaul journey, you can summerize.  But more precisely, it comprises of a string of many digitally-animated images showing various people talking about life, or our existence.  The traditional concept of story or characters are not needed, or just troublesome to enjoy this film. <br /> <br />Anyway, that's what many people say rightly.  But the impressive part of the film is that it deals with a wide range of topics -- from Plato to Nietzsche.  The real professor of philosophy appears (in digital animatation), and teaches a thing or two about one sect of pholosophy. <br /> <br />Two things must be remembered.  First, this film was released immediately after the attack of September 11th, the moment we most needed something substantial even in films.  And 'Waking Life' provided it to many people, a springboard to think about the meaning of life again.  But some people thought otherwise; after all, they might say, Why watch, when you can read? <br /> <br />[MEMORABLE VISUALS]  Why watch?  The second merit os the film is this.  Even the most sceptical would admit that the film's images are impressive in its own way, with the real-life hand-held camera's visuals which are digitally painted later.  The results are nothing you have ever seen.  But again, opinions may divide.  Some say it's epoch-making; others say it's sea-sickness.  I say both sides are right. <br /> <br />Steven Soderbergh appears as cameo, but it's very brief.  You see many others (including Linklater himself as a Man at the pinball machine) but it is Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, the stars of the director's 'Before Sunrise' who would be most well-known to us.  One inexplicable thing is that Linklater decided to let the couple show up together in bed, totally ruining the endearing feeling that they exuded in 'Before Sunrise.'  This is unacceptable, for I fondly remember these likable characters in charming 'Before Sunrise.'  Thank God that Linklater made the right sequel to their story in 'Before Sunset.' <br /> <br />The film is exactly what it is -- philosophical journey through the digitally painted world.  And what would Linklater say about 'Waking Life' now, after the success of 'School of Rock'?  I don't know, but the status of this film seems now secured, at least as visual innovation.  It turned out not to my taste, that's why 3 stars, but it is still worth trying for once or more.
B0007P3582|4.0|This cd has alot of great hooks in it. Every one expected a lot of 50 cent with his next album. Nothing is going to follow get rich or dye trying. He came out with some just as great. Buying this cd is worth it.
B000089QEN|4.0|\\"Vanity Fair,\\" first published serially in 1847-48, is William Makepeace Thackeray's tale of the fortunes of two women.  On the one hand we have the ambitious and amoral Becky Sharp, the orphaned daughter of a struggling painter and a French opera singer, and on the other the passive Amelia Sedley, the wellborn but sheltered daughter of rich merchant. The two young women meet at Miss Pinkerton's Academy for young ladies, where Becky is a tutor of French and Amelia a student, and become friends. We then follow their intertwined lives as Jane tries to climb the social ladder and Amelia follows the dictates of her heart.<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is celebrated for Thackeray's disparaging and negative portrait of the upper classes of early 19th-century England. The characters are rather vile, the relationships are hopelessly doomed, and readers who were not the targets of Thackeray's pen have enjoyed it ever since.  Like others I watched this BBC mini-series version of \\"Vanity Fair\\" after watching the recent theatrical film from director Mira Nair with Reese Witherspoon as Becky Sharp.  Ironically, Natasha Little, who plays Becky in this mini-series, plays Lady Jane Sheepshanks in the movie version.  I was bothered by the decision to make Becky nicer, because stripped of her amorality the point of the character is lost.  By the end of the first scene on the BBC version I knew that Little's Becky was indeed an amoral vixen.  The problem is that she does not seem to be smart enough about it to really win our sympathies, and that results in us being detached from the story emotionally.<br /><br />Becky Sharp has long been considered the prototype for Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara, which is an apt perspective in terms of the character's literary heritage.  But whereas we root for Scarlett to save Tara, win Rhett, and overcome all her other obstacles, Becky goes her merry way without our really caring about her one way of the other.  True, the subtitle for \\"Vanity Fair\\" is \\"A Novel Without a Hero,\\" but there is a sense of irony since the focus is primarily on the two young women, and all of the men are ultimately orbiting around them one way or the other.  Still, even in such a social satire I want to at least enjoy the anti-heroine's progression, even if I find her unsympathetic (Shakespeare's \\"Richard III\\" is unsympathetic, and I find him fascinating).<br /><br />This mini-series was written by Andrew Davies and directed by Marc Munden, and the fault in Becky Sharp's characterization belongs more to them than it does Little's performance (Frances Grey plays Amelia).  There is a scene early on where Becky impulsively decides to steal some things as she is sent packing, and I found myself thinking not so much that she was bold but that she was being stupid.  What you have to remember is that Becky Sharp is disingenuous to one and all.  The only point in the entire drama where I felt she was stripped to honest emotion and thoughts about anyone other than herself is when on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo her husband, Rawdon Crawley (Nathaniel Parker), otherwise known as her entrance into high society, is telling her what she needs to know if he does not come back.  At that moment she has the good graces to pay attention, treat the matter seriously, and not let what might be her husband's last memory of her be anything other than honest concern for his safety.<br /><br />The script certainly is faithful to Thackeray's novel, but time and time again I found the acting to be a bit too formal, even given the conventions of the time and place (David Bradley as the Sir Pitt being the exception that proves the rule).  Maybe I made a mistake watching the mini-series so soon after the theatrical film, because I tended to favor the performances in the latter, which is usually not the case when I am talking about a BBC version of a literary adaptation versus a theatrical release.  Davies makes a major decision, understandable but still a major mistake from my perspective, in deciding to forgo a narrator, since that is the only way to get a lot of Thackeray's satire and wit into the proceedings.  Since this is a BBC production so we are talking the same level of production standards we always expect to see from such period pieces.  However, if you are looking forward to any extras on this DVD, forget about it.still a major mistake from my perspective, in deciding to forgo a narrator, since that is the only way to get a lot of Thackeray's satire and wit into the proceedings.

B0007O38F8|3.0|Get Rich or Die Tryin was a classic.  Every track was tight.  But making one amazing cd and droppin good rhymes on a couple of guest spots doesnt make you a legend.  50 needs to understand that popularity does not equal respect.  I like 50's flow and his gritty lyrics, but the shots he takes at other rappers on The Massacre are pointless and disrespectful.  50 goes on TV or into the recording studio and verbally attacks these rappers, then he goes on and on about \\"Em's got my back\\" and \\"We ain't gon' back down.\\"    COME ON MAN! YOU STARTED IT! WHY SHOULD THEY BACK DOWN?!  50's like the neighborhood bully who starts fights with kids who simply look in his direction, and when they fight back, he goes and whines to his daddy, Eminem. <br /> <br />You got beef with Ja Rule? Fine.  Oh, now you're helping Em with Benzino? Alright.  Fat Joe? Ehh..  NAS?!?!?! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?! <br /> <br />50 made Get Rich or Die Tryin' = Instant classic because of his flow, the production, and shallow but entertaining lyrics <br /> <br />Nas made Illmatic = Timeless Classic because of his flow and timeless, introspective lyrics <br /> <br />Both are to be enjoyed.  Only one is to be passed down through generations.
B00005K9LK|5.0|This album was released in 1982, and I must say I am biased for this album, because it was the 1st JP album I heard and it was the one I listened to the most.  That said, biased or not, this is either the first or second best album JP has released.  This is by far the best album JP has done since 1980.  What can I say about this album other than \\"get it if you don't have it!\\"  This is a must!  One of the most perfect albums ever released, and what makes it even more remarkable is that it follows \\"Point of Entry\\", a more melodic JP record.  My ratings of the songs are out of 5 *****:<br />  The album begins with \\"The Hellion\\" an instrumental lead in for \\"Electric Eye\\",  one of the best songs ever done by a rock band. Sadly, this song is more relevant now than when it was released. After all, we do indeed now live in the age of the \\"Electric Eye\\".<br />Rating - *****<br />  \\"Riding On The Wind\\" - a great tune.  From the opening drum roll to the furious chords and solo - this song flat out ROCKS! Rating - *****<br />  \\"Bloodstone\\" - I really love this song.  I find the sound very haunting and Rob's voice and emotion comes through tremendously.  A great song I would love to have them play live.  Rating - ****<br />  \\"Chains\\" -  I also love this song. This is the most melodic of the tunes on the album and JP does it perfect.  This is a perfect rock song.  I wish they would put it in their live set. Rating  -  *****<br />  \\"Pain & Pleasure\\" - A pure S&M song.  Rob is really letting it out on this tune.  His emotion is transparent and chilling.  Another slower tune but played perfectly.  The guitar solo is great.  I really like this song.  Rating - ****<br />  \\"Screaming For Vengance\\" - The titular song and it indeed screams!  The hardest and fastest song on the album.  It grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Pure adrenaline! Rating - *****<br />  \\"Another Thing Coming\\" - The most popular song on the record.  \\"In this world we're living in we have our share of sorrows.  The answer now is don't give in, aim for a new tomorrow.\\"  Great guiter solo, great song.  Rating - *****<br />  \\"Fever\\" -  I love this song.  Please put it in the live set.  Another haunting song of desire.  Rating - *****<br />  \\"Devil's Child\\" -  I think the weakest song on the album.  But it is a hard hitting, crunching song.  Rating- ****<br />  I would LOVE for JP to play the whole album live.  This is something they should think about doing.  The fans would love it and the older fans would come back in droves to hear it.

B00004Y6O9|2.0|Yeah, the Kid's review on this page a couple reviews back is one of the few reviews that speak the truth.  This band didn't even come close to saving rock 'n' roll.  They're NOT EVEN rock 'n' roll.  THEY'RE POP, THEY'RE 80's HAIR METAL, and THEY'RE EXTREMELY OVERRATED!  Led Zeppelin is Rock 'n' Roll.  Deep Purple is Rock 'n' Roll.  AC/DC is rock 'n' roll.  Hell even Iron Maiden is more Rock 'n' Roll than this band.  I can't stand to hear and see all the lavish praise that this band receives, all the high placement on 'greatest rock bands' charts, all the people who think that Eddie Van Halen is a god and that he and David Lee Roth saved Rock 'n' Roll.  If anything this band drove rock down further into its grave.  This isn't what rock is.  This is just a bunch of watered-down riffs, empty lyrics and flahsy show with the intent of appealing to mainstream society and the pop-music masses rather than hardcore rock afficionados.  They're music makes me sick, not even because its that terrible, just because of the inflated description of their sound as classic rock 'n' roll genius and all this other overrrated praise.  It's really not that great an album or that great a band at all. <br />The only reason this album gets 2 stars is the work of Eddie Van Halen.  While he's no god, he certainly did know how to play guitar, and his work on this record is particualry excellent, especially on the song \\"Eruption\\" quite possibly the only Van Halen song worth anything.  Seriously, the name says it all: the only thing worth something in the band is the guitarist.  Roth can't sing worth a damn, the songs are vaguely catchy at best, the lyrics are mediocre, and the other instrumental work is nothing special.  To reiterate, massively overrated. <br />If you like rock 'n' roll and true hard rock, steer clear of this overrated junk.  Listen to what the kid says.  Van Halen is garbage.  Anyone who doesn't think so probably also listens to Motley Crue, and we all know that Motley Crue fans don't count.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Richard Sarafian's 1971 film \\"Vanishing Point\\" is, for starters, a fascinating study of those persons anthropologists sometimes term \\"marginal men\\"--individuals caught between two powerful and competing cultures, sharing some important aspects of both but not a true part of either, and, as such, remain tragically confined to an often-painful existential loneliness. Inhabiting a sort of twilight zone between \\"here\\" and \\"there,\\" a sort of peculiar purgatory, these restless specters cannot find any peace or place, so they instead instinctively press madly on to some obscure and unknown destination, the relentless journey itself being the only reason and justification. <br /> <br />Disc jockey Super Soul (Cleavon Little) and delivery driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) are two of these specters, marginal but decent, intelligent men who can't or won't live in burgeoning competing cultures which in reality have offered them very little of worth or substance, despite their own personal sacrifices. Kowalski himself had tried to \\"fit in\\" with the Establishment as a soldier and police officer and later, attempted to do the same with the blossoming 1960s counterculture, but soon disappointingly found that they both were ridden with their own various forms of dishonesty and insincerity. Personal honor, self-reliance, honesty, justice and genuine respect--Kowalski's stock in trade--were tragically valued very little by either, despite each one's shrill and haughty claims to the contrary. <br /> <br />Moreover, it's no accident Newman's character has a Polish surname; the Poles throughout their history have created a very rich and unique Slavic culture largely based upon just such a \\"marginality\\"--being geographically jammed between two powerful and radically different historic enemies, Germany and Russia, and never being able to fully identify with either one, at often great cost to themselves. It's also no accident Little's character is blind and black, the only one of his kind in asmall, all-Caucasian western desert town--his sightlessness enhancing his persuasiveness and his ability to read Kowalski's mind, the radio microphone his voice, his race being the focus of long simmering and later suddenly explosive disdain--all of the characteristics of a far-seeing prophet unjustly (but typically) dishonored in his own land. <br /> <br />The desert environment also plays a key role in cementing the personal relationship between and respective fates of these two men--to paraphrase British novelist J.G. Ballard, prophets throughout our history have emerged from deserts of some sort since deserts have, in a sense, exhausted their own futures (like Kowalski himself had already done) and thus are free of the concepts of time and existence as we have conventionally known them (as Super Soul instinctively knew, thus creating his own psychic link to the doomed driver.) Everything is somehow possible, and yet, somehow nothing is. <br /> <br />Finally, \\"Vanishing Point\\" is also a \\"fin de siecle\\" story, a unique requiem for a quickly dying age,a now all-but-disappeared one of truly open roads, endless speed for the joy of speed's sake, of big, solid muscle cars, of taking radical chances, of living on the edge in a colorful world of endless possibility, seasoned with a large number and wide variety of all sorts of unusual characters straight from the minds of Mark Twain and Nelson Algren, all of which had long made the USA a wonderful place. \\"Vanishing Point\\" poignantly shows us that such a world was already slipping away in 1971, and now, over 30 years later, it sadly is but a fond memory, having been brutally supplanted by today's swarms of sadistic, military-weaponed cop-thugs, obsessive and intrusive safety freaks, soulless toll plazas, smug yuppie SUV drivers, tedious carbon-copy latte towns, and a infantile craving for perfect, high-fuel-efficiency safety and security, rather than individual liberty, at all costs, a \\"brave new world\\" where simply wanting to be left alone amidst Orwellian chants of \\"it's for the children\\" and \\"either you're with us or against us\\" is now tantamount to near-treason. <br /> <br />The DVD contains both the US and UK releases of the film; the UK release, I believe, is a much more satisfying film, as it has the original scenes deleted from the US version. As an aside, Super Soul's radio station call letters, KOW, are in fact the ones for a country & western station in San Diego.
B0007O38F8|2.0|50 Cent only has a three good songs on here. I was very disappointed when I purchased this album. 50 Cent needs to stop trying to make his own beats. He needs to let Eminem & Dr. Dre produce all of his beats until he gets the hang of it. I hope the next aftermath cd is better than this.

B0002XVQNU|4.0|As a huge fan of the Daredevil comics, the abuse that the original cut goes through makes me sad.  And I'll admit, I walked out of the theater feeling let down.  There are so many great stories that could have been told about Daredevil, but instead, the movie made an unorginized (and unsuccessful) mish-mash of all the favorite Daredevil plots.  But, after seeing the director's cut, all I have to say is that it's a shame this version didn't make it to the theaters.  This is more along the lines of how Daredevil should be. <br /> <br />As you probably already know, the movie is 30 minutes longer, scenes are rearranged, expanded and even cut from the film entirely.  So I won't go over what other reviewers have already done, with explaining what's new and what's not in anymore.  Instead, I'll go over what I liked and didn't like about the new material. <br /> <br />The new subplot with Coolio was what I probably like most about the entire movie.  It did a wonderful job showing Matt's life in the courtroom, and how Foggy handles himself when Matt doesn't show up.  Like any scene with Foggy, it's all very funny.  The director's cut also spends more time exploring Matt's faith (and often times, lack of).  It's an echo of the story that Kevin Smith wrote (and actually finished!) called \\"Guardian Devil.\\"  It doesn't add up to much, and the scenes involving a mysterious nun watching over him will leave those not familiar with the comics confused.  Perhaps the true nature of who she is was meant to come through in a suquel. <br /> <br />To put it simply, the director's cut is the version of the film worth watching.  It's a shame that most won't watch it because they were so unimpressed by the original.  The movie still isn't great, and feels uneven (going from dark to light so frequently).  But whether or not you've seen the original, watch this.  I wasn't sorry.
B00005JNNL|5.0|This film that deserved with all the possible honors the Prize as Best Foreign Film deals with a delicate and very personal ethic crossroad: Can you decide your lifetime under these awful and painful conditions?<br /><br />Obviously the omnipresence of the death is a motive of fear and anguish for a great number of human beings. But my personal reflection is this: the death is the last stage of your life, so I think it's better to re formulate the question for another one. The real important aspect is how have you lived? and not focuse exclusively in how you will die. We are in the world for living and doing everything what we can make, according our natural gifts and talents: the rest of the issue has no importance. If you have had the opportunity to follow your bliss what's the problem with dying in an early age?. I consider it's better to live a short life and productive instead a long life and improductive.<br /><br />So in this point I believe you must respect the personal decision of every person to turn off the light of his private existence under these horrible conditions.<br /><br />All the ethic considerations seem obvious while you are from the other side of the issue. It is so easy to judge the outer decisions arguing words but Do you think it is enough to talk and only for a just moment to assume his terrible position?.<br /><br />Amenabar built a supreme film where he presents a huge portrait about the different ethic positions; the beloved brother who denies the final solution arguing his point of view, till his lovely lawyer who will suffer a secure death.<br /><br />San Pedro is clearer about that issue than many of us. He got and tried to exhibit all the possible arguments and was not heard at all under legal circumstances. The discussion among the priest and Bardem is one the highlight issues of the film.<br /><br />Javier Bardem at this time is one of the best five actors in the Cinema world. His facial expressions are a real master class for all the acting students and the rest of the audience. His face is a real rainbow which shows all the possible frecuencies in what anima concerns.<br /><br />What was the unexpainable reason which avoided he was not nominated for the Academy Award by this acting? Because if you argue the theme is delicate I could remember you the Academy Award to Hanks by Philadelphia for instance, or the most recent Prize to Benigni in Life is beautiful and Adrian Brody for the Pianist. Anyway, the past now belongs to the story and this default will never hide the astonishing presence and sublime performance of this talented actor who caught with admirable eloquence the personal tragedy of a sensitive and extraordinary human being.<br /><br />The rest of the cast worked out to perfection level. There is no any fissure, and the edition and photograph are simply overwhelming.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece film and being Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar a very  young film maker, it would be risky to affirm this is his masterpiece, but if not it will be one of the three major achievements in his promising career.<br /><br />An artistic triumph all the way!ce.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I grew up on old country music. I'm a big fan of Loretta Lynn and Tanya Tucker. I hate to see country crossing over to the pop side of things and it's refreshing to see a greatest hits collection from someone who is true to her country music roots. The music of Shania Twain takes me back to the times my uncle would take me to the grand ole opry to see real country. Now you've got posers like Gretchen Wilson who aren't old school like Shania and Faith Hill. <br /> <br />You want memories? My buddy .47 cent and I used to cruise Omaha in my renault alliance playing tunes like \\"The Auctioneer\\", \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"Dude looks like a lady\\". We were totally country. I spraypainted the words, \\"Cowboy UP!!\\" on both doors of my car and had a gun rack mounted on my back window. I had two muskets on it in case trouble arose. .47 and I would compete in rodeos like Lane Frost. We didn't have big bulls where I grew up so we rode bucking donkeys. If you stayed on for a half hour, you won. So many great memories and nothing brings it back like REAL country music.

I'm so thrilled to have found out about this fun series!  <br /> <br />One more thing. What I think was so refreshing about this \\"Chick lit\\" novel is that for once, it did not revolve around men or boyfriends or trying to get married. Those are all fun topics, and there are lots of great books out there on them, but for once, this wasn't the driving force in the book - or even in the next one, when she does have a boyfriend. There is a good balance.
B00000C28M|5.0|Glenn Gould played this Brahms's piano Concerto in the most irreverent possible way. With this approach G.G pretended to prove there' something sick in the heart of the romantic mood. Maybe you remember the celebrated series Civilization's Kenneth Clark concerned with the Romanticism. The camera shows a turbulent sea beating on the rocks in the middle of a tempest with the Pastoral Symphony's Third Movement as musical curtain. And suddenly a picture is seen in a museum's wall showing the scene of a torment but now it's Brahms `s Third Symphony's third Movement the musical support.<br /><br />In few words, Bernstein makes an important forewarning: He doesn't share the vision of Gould respect to the whole conception of the extremely slow tempos, but he respects Mr. Gould and Bernstein, in a obvious example of tolerance - an magnificent example of democracy in action - accorded to join in this anti climatic and sophisticated performance. This reading will divide the audience in just two: you'll love it or hate it , but there's no space for a neutral position. This approach plays hard with the passionate listener usually accustomed to the tearful faces and the exacerbated melodrama sense of the last half of the Century specifically in this firework concerts - as the famous and well known musical match between Franz Liszt and  Sigismund Thalberg in Paris- or so many and documented cases of overindulgent pages of Romantic dullness. Gould above all wants to unmask the persistent atrophy and lack of sincerity of great portion of the audience who goes to the concert in search other interests absolutely divorced of the authentic reason who joins them, and in the other hand to prove the Romanticism in excess is a sign of lack of force . So consider the attack is not about Brahms specifically due the fact he recorded two CD of this composer years later after this recital, making a special inflexion in the gesture without transcended will. I guess Gould must not have been a passionate reader of  Proust or Victor Hugo.

B00005JN4H|2.0|This movie of a bumbling policemean (Jimmy Fallon) and a go-getter taxi driver (Queen Latifah) sounds good when you read the blurb.    The movies has its moments, especially when Queen Latifah appears on the screen. But, on the whole the movie does not deliver what it promises in the blurb. I would not recommend this movie. See the movie if you have no other options when you go to rent it at your local video store.
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 is/was my fav rapper, now hes acting like a lil baby.  He kicked the game out of G-unit just cuz he doesnt want to be involved in 50s beefs...which is just about every single person in rap.  Hes now the cockiest person ive ever heard.  This cd is no where near Get rich or die trien.  Gatman and robin with eminem is the best song on the whole cd, and even in that song 50 makes it very clear that hes the best and he cant be killed cuz hes the best.  He also needs to learn that there is more to life than ice,drugs,guns and hoes that all he talks about and in the rap game these subjects are kind of worn out
B000063DFQ|5.0|I remember listening to Maiden for the first time about 10 years ago, and after that, there was no helping me, I was hooked. To tell the truth, i didn't like their first couple of albums, killers was good, but other than that, nothing special. But then they launched Piece of Mind, Number of the Beast, and all those other great albums which led to Brave New World and a sellout crowd of 250,000 ot Rock in Rio. All in all, I think Maiden is a great band, and songs like The Trooper and Flight of Icarus prove just that
B000001ABD|4.0|Stevie Wonder's career is among the most successful in music history. From his years as boy genius in the 1960s' to his groundbreaking 1970s' albums to his 1980s' career, right up to today, Stevie has been consistently a force to be reckoned with, both artistically and commerically. Which makes it extremely hard to compile his best work into a one or even two - disc set, because technically (and this is just an opinion), he's never really done anything bad. 1996's \\"Song Review - Greatest Hits\\" tries to put Stevie's best on 2 discs, with mixed results.<br /><br />For a solid two disc collection of all Stevie's \\"biggest hits\\", \\"Song Review\\" is a good start for beginning Stevie fans. Boasting classics such as \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\", \\"My Cherie Amour\\", \\"Sign, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours\\", \\"Master Blaster (Jammin'), \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" and \\"I Wish\\", it features some classic hit singles. Also, some lesser known works such as \\"Hey Love\\", \\"You Will Know\\" and \\"These Three Words\\" have been included to entice hardcore fans.<br /><br />Now, here are my problems. For starters many of Stevie's biggest hits singles aren't here. They are all great songs, including \\"You Haven't Done Nothing\\" (a number one hit), \\"Fingertips\\" (Stevie's first chart hit and another number one single), \\"If You Really Love Me\\" (possibly my all time favorite), \\"Heaven Help Us All\\", \\"For Once In My Life\\" (a number two hit), \\"Shoo - Be - Doo - Be - Doo - Da - Day\\", \\"Yester - Me, \\"Yester - You, Yesterday\\", \\"Go Home\\", \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\" and \\"A Place In The Sun\\" - and these are just the omissions that made the top ten. There are numerous top forty hits missing, too many to name.<br /><br />Another problem is that may of the songs are edited from their original versions. Part of the beauty of Stevie's songs is that some can stretch out into seven, eight, nine or even ten minutes, but Stevie would always add something new to keep it from getting repetitive. Which means there's no reason to cut \\"Part-Time Lover\\", \\"Ribbon In The Sky\\", \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\", \\"Living For The City\\", \\"For Your Love\\", \\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\\" and \\"Higher Ground\\", which are ten times better in their long versions. I guess you can say the edits on disc one were to include all ten minutes and twenty seven second of the excellent \\"Do I Do\\" (one of my all time favorites), but the ones on disc two should have been definitely been kept in their entirety.<br /><br />For a far better representation of Stevie's career, try picking up the four disc boxed set \\"At The Close Of A Century\\". This set features almost all of the songs on this compilation as well as lesser known gems like \\"I'm Wondering\\", \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"Never Dreamed You'd Leave In Summer\\", \\"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\\", \\"I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)\\", \\"Creepin'\\", \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\", \\"Pastime Paradise\\", \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", \\"Ngiculela-En Historia-I Am Singing\\", \\"If It's Magic\\" \\"As\\", \\"Another Star\\", \\"Rocket Love\\", \\"Happy Birthday\\", and \\"How Come, How Long\\" (a duet with Babyface).<br /><br />The only reason to buy this collection if you already have \\"At The Close Of A Century\\" is for four songs that are on \\"Song Review\\". First, there's the smash Paul McCartney duet \\"Ebony And Ivory\\", which I guess can also be found on a few Paul McCartney albums. Then there's three songs only available on here. First, there's the gorgeous ballad \\"Stay Gold\\", from the 1983 movie \\"The Outsiders\\" (great movie, by the way). Then there's the pretty \\"Kiss Lonely Goodbye\\". Following that is the uplifting hip hop number \\"Hold On To Your Dream\\". Finally, there's an excellent cover of Bob Marley's classic \\"Redemption Song\\".<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good collection of Stevie's best. My advice is if you can't afford the four cd boxed set, pick up \\"Song Review\\" and it will do...for now. However, the songs are great nonetheless and should be cherished for many more years to come.er\\", \\"Ribbon In The Sky\\", \\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\", \\"Living For The City\\", \\"For Your Love\\", \\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\\" and \\"Higher Ground\\", which are ten times better in their long versions.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|this is the greatest cd i own. next to atreyu's \\"the curse\\". waking the fallen is a mix between metal and screamo that is addictive and filled with great lyrics and great guitar riffs. i definently reccomend this cd.
B00005LANG|5.0|Abosolutly amazing! In my opinon Bob's best. I havent found anything better. Ever song is amazing, atleast on the orginal release (without bonus tracks).
B0007TKNL0|1.0|In spite of the lavish sets, vibrant costumes and visually appealing cinematography, this filmed-version of Phantom is hopelessly dull, leaden and uninspired; and, unlike the soaring and luminous chandelier in the opening sequence, regrettably earthbound, and emotionally unsatisfying.     Many missteps, and unfortunate miscastings leaves this phantom \\"dead-in-the-lair\\" and a dismal disappointment. Schumacher would do well to view films by masters, e.g. Cukor, Wyler, Minnelli, etc., should he ever be re-hired to direct another screen musical. (Shame on Weber for recruiting him in the first place.)    One star for Rossum who succeeds where Butler fails. Overall, this film pales in comparison to the sensational musical play  millions of people will continue to relish and enjoy in theatres across the globe.
067101756X|5.0|Having read the TOP Four books in the UFO/Alien/ Government Coverup Genre;  <br />Alien Agenda by the best selling author of 'Crossfire' Jim Marrs (Best reference on UFOlogy) is my favorite; followed by 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger (Great fiction-soon to be a movie), co-authored by a real black program insider; and the scientists UFO Bible,  `Unconventional Flying Objects,' by the scientist Dr. Paul Hill (NASA UFO Investigator for 30 years).  <br /> <br />I'd say Corso's book is a MUST READ! Why would a respected, decorated, connected Military Officer swear in a Court of Law that the UFO Conspiracy is real and that the facts and agenda in these books ARE TRUE.  <br /> <br />Why? If you read this excellent book and the others, you will know that they are indeed true. Two well respected American Astronauts have come forward to proclaim they had seen evidence of the Roswell UFO crash and stated they know the cover-up is real. Was Corso's sudden demise a product of this conspiracy? You be the judge.  <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|I brought this CD based on the fact that it was 50 Cent as will the other (at least 1) million people did. After waiting for so long and listening to the buzz that was going on as far as the \\"Piggy Bank\\" song, I was hyped to how the CD was going to be. \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin' \\" (I wont lie) was a great album. But 50 has proven that there is a sophmore jinx. This is the worst album I have heard in the last 5 years (please take note that Chingy has dropped 2 cd's in that span of time that I havent even heard)!!!!!!!! Out of 22 tracks there about 4 songs that are ok. I felt that he was more lyrical on the first album then he was on this album. I think 50 has gotten cocky after selling 11 million (on the first cd), that now he feels that he can put his name on anything and it will sell crazy like it did the first time. This album will sell no more then 3 to 5 million copies after the new buzz going around will be that this sh*t is horrible.
B00005JNQQ|5.0|I haven't seen this movie but it ranks w/ the all time classics like Gone With the Wind, Gladiator, Braveheart, Casa Blanca, Star Wars, Terminator, Toy Story and Santa Claus conqueors the martians! Wow! <br /> <br />Truely an epic tale that I haven't seen yet.  I believe everyone should review movies they haven't seen yet and rate them 5 stars.  <br /> <br />
B000066NW0|3.0|You're probably not really looking for a real review of the CD, which I, unlike many of the other \\"punx\\" here, have actually heard. So I won't waste my time. It's a catchy, pop rock CD, nothing spetacular, and that's that. I just wanted to tell all your PUNX RAWKERS, who say Avril and Blink 182 and Good Charolette and Simple Plan are all so POSER and to \\"go listen to real punk like the Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, NoFX, Bad Religion...\\", that you're no better than the Hot Topic shoppers. Because you obviously consider yourself very punk rock, and that defies the whole point of punk. Punk is not dead and it's not being ruined, but none of you are understanding it.  <br /> <br />Let me give you a little run down of your bands, first. The Ramones are classic POP PUNK. The Clash, aside from London Calling, is actually a lot more SKA and RAGGAE sounding than any thing else. NoFX is trendy POP PUNK pretending to be real punk. Bad Religion is actually really MELODIC punk. Sex Pistols might be a real classic, but I doubt any of you have even heard much of their songs. You just learned to name drop at an early age.  <br /> <br />There are other punk bands out there and there are other fantastic genres, but if you keep thinking about your PUNK ROCKNESS and only listen to your tiny range of music, you're not going to get to hear any of it. So please, stop it with the POSER crap. You're more of a poser than anyone else.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|From start to finish, this album captivates you to keep listening and keep feeling the experience that the Mars Volta have created.  For those who loved DITC and listened to it straight through the moment they purchased it, this album is the same way.  Starting with the quiet intro of Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus and then blasting right back into outer space with Jon Theodore intense drums, Omars mind boggling solos, and the shrieking vocal prowess of Cedric.  The album never loses impact from start to finish.  Each song transitions seemlessly almost making the album into a one song 77 minute masterpiece.   <br /> <br />If you have already listened to the cd and feel disappointed, listen again and I am sure you will start to realize the genius placed inside this work of art <br /> <br />Con_safo out...
B0007P3582|1.0|well,all i can say is that this is NOT his best work. I'd rather listen to chingy or fat joe. If you're looking for some good 50 cent, then i highly reccomend you get \\"Guess Who's Back?\\". Heck, even \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" tryin was better then this garbage.
0767834739|1.0|There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.<br /><br />For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.ple who expect and deserve something else.    Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons.

B000002I25|5.0|The first album for the doors is amazing.  What I really love about the doors is that they could debut today in 2005 and sound new and original.  This album is timeless.  The only music I can recommend over this album is anything by Robert Johnson, or anything by Muddy Watters.  Cream's Disraeli Gears comes close to this one as well.  Although many Doors fans will hate this, I think there is way too much focus on Jim Morrison when people talk of the doors.  The Doors couldn't have been the doors without him, but all of the other members were just as essential to the band.  The only flaw with this album in my opinion are the lyrics towards the latter part of \\"The End\\".  I think when Jim Morrison goes into \\"The killer awoke before dawn...\\" it interrupts the mood of the song.  The End musically conveys the concept of time and love in my opinion and adding death and incest just doesnt work!
B00008EYA5|2.0|Ugh! SWAT is a miserable film. I remember when I was a kid and I'd play at Cops and Robbers with other kids. We'd run around with invisible guns indiscriminately shooting at each other. SWAT has that same mentality and is aimed at the same age group. It's not a movie, it's shamefully disguised pro-NRA propaganda. For all the gun glorification and random violence (PG-13 rated violence remember, as they want to expose this drivel to the little kiddies) there is not one subtle moment that tells us guns are dangerous. Here they are just toys and shooting people is just fun.<br /><br />I shouldn't really complain so hard as for the first whole hour of this film NOTHING happens. It's all devoted to pointless character building which never rises past cliched stereotypes (Michelle Rodriguez expands her range by playing an unhappy, scowling Latino-something she hasn't played before) and is totally ditched with the abrupt, anti-climatic ending.<br /><br />SWAT promises action and the not-quite high concept plot of a crime-lord offering anyone who can break him out of custody a $100 million reward is never fully realised. We could have had 2 whole hours of excitement but we barely get 45 minutes. It's a slow, boring film with absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. Plus it all seems very 70's. I felt embarressed watching it.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are extras but do I care?
0451527046|5.0|I re-read this recently, after first reading it as a child about twenty years ago. I liked it both times, but enjoyed it more this time. As a child I remember frequently being stalled by the unfamiliar nautical terms, looking them up in the dictionary and <br />feeling little wiser. Many of them refer to pieces of equipment and, without a picture, the best dictionary in the world isn't going to let you visualise it. But as anyone who's read Patrick O'Brian without being a naval historian knows, all those nautical terms might just as well be made up grobblebems and bindledums, because the story isn't about them. It's about the people, and about treasure, and what people will do to get some, and that's all we need to know about to understand everything that goes on. <br /> <br />This time I was more focussed on the colourful characters and swashbuckling adventure. I found I'd almost entirely forgotten the opening chapters, with the inn terrorised by the wonderful horrible old pirate, and the procession of progresively more terrible visitors, but they were one of the highlights on this reading. Long John Silver is by far the most interesting character, narrator Jim Hawkins being something of a colourless \\"good boy\\". And perhaps Jim should be called Lucky Jim, for the chief weakness of the book is the extent to which blind luck saves the day, and the number of times that some inexplicable, irrational act of Jim's turns out to be just what was needed to make everything all right. But all that is more than made up for by the genius of Silver's character, and the unpredictability that he brings to the story. <br /> <br />One thing that raises this above a lot of other adventure fiction is that the characters live in a world of economic reality, driven by the need to earn a living and the desire to not have to earn a living any more; whereas so many adventure characters seem to live in a rent-free fantasy world. Possibly this aspect of the book contributes to its greater appeal for me as an adult reader; to a child the pirates were just bad people who did bad things because they were bad, but as an adult who has to earn a living I can better understand why they want that treasure so much.
0316172324|5.0|The reason it doesn't always work is because it isn't about guessing, it's about listening.  Often when it's our first impression in a situation, we don't realize that we didn't conjure up the answer.  It simply came with no mental prodding.  That is, it didn't come from the mind, but through it.  No doubt, that's a hard one to swallow for someone who's rigidly geared to left-brain thinking.  But this is what I have come to know is the truth, and that enlightenment did not come from a science book...or \\"logic.\\" :) <br /> <br />When we scramble for the answer, we are conjuring up one out of fear.  Things we create from fear are generally inaccurate...and it also creates really lousy supposed \\"art,\\" but that's another point...  When we put less thought and more \\"feel\\" into it, we're more likely to be accurate.  When all you have is a split second, \\"feel\\" is all you've got.  Hence, in those situations, we don't have time to muddy up the answer with our fearful thoughts, the answer will come and there's no time to analyze it and change it to a more \\"logical\\" answer. <br /> <br />But if we have a few seconds or moments to think, infuse our fear and supposed logic into it, then it may seem that it was our first impression, but it wasn't.  We didn't \\"hear\\" the first impression, because we had just enough time to jump in and be all logical, hee, hee...   <br /> <br />We've been given the keys in biblical text, \\"be still and know.\\"  When the mind is racing with fear, it isn't still, we aren't calm.  That true first impression comes before we have time to introduce that element that generally gums up the works (fear).   <br /> <br />When you do have time, get still (mind and body) and listen, don't conjure or guess, just listen.  When you don't have time (split-second situations), no time to question or analyze, not even an instant for fearful guessing...when there's no question that it came without thought.  Feel it, trust it, go! :)  I'd trust that in a heartbeat over long,laborious, fearful thinking. <br /> <br />Ultimately, lighten your grip on them there science books and know that there's a lot more power in your \\"heart\\" than you seem to realize.  Your right brain/heart will serve you well.  Balance it with what you seem to believe is the totality of your power (left brain), and you'll see...   <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|I am not impressed with 50's latest album.  <br /> <br />I remember hearing his last album 2 wks before it was released and I thought it was good rap; cool rhymes over great beats, but this new crap is anything but. <br /> <br />The first 2 singles have done well and are actually GOOD based on the fact that he's 50 alone and THEY ARE radio friendly rap tracks. <br /> <br />The rest of the album leaves much to be desired. There are about 2 other tracks that I could see the record company releasing to help sell the album. Regardless, This album will top next week's Billboard Charts with huge sales. <br /> <br />I hate the fact that this album TRULY SUCKS but it will STILL SELL.....such a shame. <br /> <br />The only reason why this album might sell includes all those wankstas who will buy it for the sake of having 50's album because it's a 'COOL' thing to have. I bet half those consumers won't even LISTEN TO IT (other than the singles). <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and purchase a better rap album like Ludacris, Nas or even some older classic JayZ. THE GAME's album is waaaaaay better than 50's yet 50 talks all that crap about making his album hot. I guess he used all the good material on GAME's which must be WHY his sucks a$s. Heh. <br /> <br />1/5 stars because I AM NOT IMPRESSED. HEAR IT on Mtv's The Leak b4 you buy it or just don't purchase at all. HORRIBLE. <br /> <br />He got shot 9 times? I got shot TWICE in my ear after hearing the whole album (at least I gave it more than 1 chance before I wrote a review). <br /> <br />WARNING - BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. <br /> <br />
B0001DI0FI|2.0|Come on people how can you stand this movie. I have a cousing who hasn't ever seen more than 20 minutes of it because he falls asleep. It's not worth the time. theres no plot, no real purpose to the movie!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicca was another fine animated movie from this studio.  The movie carries you on a journey through physical places as well as emotional.  I still say \\"Spirited Away\\" is the best work from this studio.
B00079ZACM|5.0|This is probably one of the best classic action/adventure movies ever made.  Once you get past the sentimental/romantic sub plot and get to the action, it really takes off.  The desert locations make you thirsty and the heroism displayed by the main character makes you want to cheer.  Finally, the dungeon scenes show a side of torturous prison life that will turn your stomach.  All in all, a wonderful film, depicting a side of war most films of this era avoid.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I know that so many people see this movie as about spiritualism and art and I want to add my two cents to the debate. That may be true but the love story itself says it all. When Satine sings at the beginning of the film she is yearing for Christian but doesn't have a name for it. Christian is yearing for Satine but doesn't know true love until he meets her. Enter the Duke. Satine must perform for him but the secret song is sung for Christian. The moral of the story is that sometimes when we feel or say or do or sing we aren't sure for whom until we find the true object of our affections. Then and only then can we name it. That is why the people saying the music is no good are just missing the point. The music is not the point but the singing of it to the special person we love. And just like the world would think the Duke was a strong and powerful man and Christian a fool the world thinks pop songs are just plain stupid. Sometimes the world is wrong. Just what we used to think isn't. Satine realizes that her ideal of a Duke type lover was wrong. Get over it people! The music is supposed to be dumb. Just as dumb as demanding that musical theatre must try to imitate Verdi or something or die as a flimsy American pseudo attempt at opera.
B00006SFBD|5.0|After the bleak and icy sojourn of 2001's \\"Blackwater Park\\", Opeth, masters of progressive death metal, returned to their homeland to recooperate and reinvent themselves, reincarnate themselves, and bring another new surprise to the face of metal as they have since the beginning of their existence... And here we are once again. <br /> <br />Opting for a more death metal-oriented sound, Opeth adding a savage tone to this album with VERY personal (almost misanthropic) and dark lyrics, while Mikael's growls grew greatly in their deliverance, projection, and power. His vile shrieks, growls, and yells are the most aggressive I have heard on any Opeth album to date, and add a bitter and unforgiving edge to the crunchy guitars and battering drumwork. But at the same time, his clean voice is still as haunting as ever, sometimes soaked in effects such as echo to acheive an empty atmosphere. I can honestly say that the album cover perfectly depicts the music. Whereas \\"Blackwater Park\\" was a relaxing autumn morning trip through foggy forests with dew sprinkling on the leaves of dead trees, \\"Deliverance\\" is like a nightmare, dragging the listener through blackened ancient memories, torment, and hatred. Just look at the album cover, and you'll understand. <br /> <br />However, this isn't to say that Opeth have taken the route of technical wankery or ridiculous obscruity, nor simplifying themselves to proto-typical \\"cookie monster\\" metal. In fact, they've done the opposite. Song structures and technical abilities of all the musicians (especially Martin Lopez, the drummer) has skyrocketed, and the songwriting technique seems much more intent on atmosphere than being heavy. (Ironic, isn't it? This is most likely Opeth's heaviest album.) There are still of acoustic passages coupled with jazzy solos (ala \\"Morningrise\\") with Akerfeldt's smooth vocals overlapping it all, but there are fewer of them than previous outings. The sound is all-around more ferocious with crushing leads, complex drumming rhythms with pummeling double bass, and the almighty growl. If you're used to the sound of the eariler albums, this album may not be for you. <br /> <br />The highlights of the album are, to me at least, \\"Wreath\\", with its strange polyrhythms near the end (bongos?) and outstanding drumwork, as well as the headbanging title track. But the big moment comes with \\"Master's Apprentice\\", boasting ballsy guitars, mercyless drumming, and absolutely hateful vocals, but also keeps the classic Opeth formula intact. In short, this is one of my favorite Opeth song and sums up the album well. After that comes \\"By the Pain I See in Others\\", the most experimental track with its haunting atmosphere, constant tempo changes, and displaying of top-notch musicianship. Also, after you think the track ends, there are some VERY strange and creepy backwards vocals being sung... A bit un-nerving, really... <br /> <br />Opeth have compiled yet another masterpiece, which has my eternal praises. This may not be for the older fans of thw band, but is definitely a great starting point for any new fans, despite the complex and inaccessible song structures. But believe me... Once you really \\"understand\\" this album, you'll be grateful you made this purchase. Highly reccommended. <br /> <br />Highlights: Wreath, Deliverance, Master;s Apprentice
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Three years after their incredible 1st album, APC has done it again. With the addition of Jeordie White and James Iha, (did not record on the album though) APC has a new, bolder, dynamic sound. Getting right to the point, it's an amazing album. The brightest moments being 'The Outsider', 'Weak and Powerless', 'Pet', and the single cover, 'The Nurse Who Loved Me'. It's different enough from Mer de Noms to make us wonder what the next original album will sound like.
B0007O38F8|5.0|The only thing holding this cd back is the greatness of the game's cd. if 50 didnt just get rid of game, then e wouldn't be comparing as much as we are. the thing is game's cd is better than 50's. but this cd is not as bad as some people are rating it (1 star?) this cd has some very interesting songs on it. gatman and robbin is one of the funniest songs i have heard in a while. and outta control is one of the best dance songs ive heard in a while. 5 stars for me.
B0002O7XW2|3.0|John Carpenter's \\"Christine\\".  Based upon the novel by Stephen King.  The good news is, this isn't a \\"bad\\" adaptation.  That shouldn't suggest its a good one either.  Anyone who has read the book can tell you the movie jumbled a lot of things around.  But you can't expect a movie adaptation to be perfect.  For that, I graded this loosely.<br /><br />Keith Gordon plays Arnie Cunningham.  A student who's commonly picked on, and tries (too hard at times) to be popular and fit in with the crowd.  John Stockton plays his best friend, Dennis Guilder, who sticks with Arnie through all the good and the bad.<br /><br />When Dennis is busy taking Arnie for a ride home, Arnie spots a busted down 1958 Plymouth in a horrible looking yard.  This soon becomes the biggest obsession with his life.  The cars name is Christine.  To us, she's just a normal car.  To Arnie, she's his lover.  But the reality of it: She's a demon on wheels.<br /><br />The movie starts off fine at first.  The way the characters are portrayed in the movie is disturbingly good.  The casting was great too.  I'm impressed with how people got into their rolls, and how the movie played out because of it.  It made watching it better, at least.  Arnie, I felt, was a little overdone in the beginning.  He looks almost too nerdish.  So nerdish that when he begins to cuss at his parents, it almost looks completely out of character for him.  But as the movie drags on (and he later loses the glasses) his character becomes deeper, and better.<br /><br />The problem I had with this film was the pace.  It doesn't move too slow, it rather moves too fast.  When Arnie first gets the car, everything is fine and dandy.  Then, as he becomes obsessed with his car, he changes.  The problem is, we know he's changed, but we didn't get to see him undergo that change long enough.  You had to adapt to the fact that he had changed before we even realized he had changed.<br /><br />The music was nice, but the death scenes weren't up to par with how gruesome they were in the book.  The book was much more exhilerating and heart pounding.<br /><br />Lastly, the movie just wasn't scary.  There's too much build up to the point where one can't be frightened.  The important parts it zips through so fast that there's no suspense build up.  In fact, the only surprise is near the end of the movie.  Sadly, it's only a surprise because it's so incredibly different from the book.  \\"The Shining\\" was scary, even if you read the book.  \\"Carrie\\" was scary, even if you read the book.<br /><br />\\"Christine\\" is not scary in the slightest.  It tries so hard to be but it really isn't.  Fine performances, fine characters.  But on the horror scale it gets a zero.weren't up to par with how gruesome they were in the book.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|In an age of stunning CGI films, I was afraid that Nausicaa of  the Valley of the Wind, with its hand drawn animation, might be showing its age. I am happy to report that I was wrong.<br /><br />With lush landscapes that will come to no surprise to devotees of Miyazaki's work, Nausicaa is filled with a vivid palette of colors, and vivid colorful characters.<br /><br />The English dub is fantastic, as well. Alison Lohman is perfect as the gently brave Princess Nausicaa. Patrick Stewart is a perfect fit for the wise and revered Lord Yupa. Edward James Olmos is utterly believable as the loyal and feisty Mito. And Uma Thurman is fabulous as the cold and cynical Kushana.<br /><br />And the story still stands the test of time, being itself an ageless tale.<br /><br />The extra features are also worth the time and energy, especially the interviews with the voice cast, and the brief history of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.<br /><br />This is a movie for the whole family to enjoy.
B000002552|5.0|This is my #1 desert island album. It's just... Words fail me.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />...More or less... <br /> <br /> <br />If you like so called \\"alt country\\" music and you don't have this, shame on you! This is the first and best example of that genre. It's also some of Dylan's most timeless stuff. Mark my words! I've got the 5 disc set, too, but I always reach for this collection. The Band songs that aren't from the basement are some of the Band's best songs and they are completely at home here.  <br /> <br /> <br />Total classic.
078322804X|5.0|So says John Belushi's character, Joliet Jake Blues to brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) after he \\"sees the light\\". The Godafther of Soul, James Brown, plays a high-spirited reverend leading the choir and congregation on \\"The Old Landmark.\\" Before all this, Jake is released early from prison, and him and Elwood visit the Penguin, Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman) at the orphange where they were raised. They learn that the Church is no longer interested in keeping the orphanage, and the only way to keep it is if $5,000 is paid. They offer to help, but she doesn't want stolen money. The other part of their \\"family' is Curtis (Cab Calloway) who says that they need a little \\"Churching up\\". Once they experience Reverend Cleophus is where Jake gets inspired and joins the congregation dancing to the high-spirited gospel number. Him and Elwood are going to reunite their rhythm and blues band. They start recruiting and along the way, we see them jam with legendary musicians like Aretha Franklin who tells Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy to \\"think\\" before he goes back out with his \\"hoodlum friends.\\" Yep, she breaks into that song. Play it loud! Before that as they ride through some sort of a street fair, they catch John Lee Hooker and his band playing that hot electric blues on \\"Boom Boom.\\" I'd love to see him and his band in my town jamming. It sure looked like he was having a good time. These made music the way it was supposed to be: fun! Anyway, the Blues Brothers make an I.O.U. with Ray Charles at his music exchange on an electric piano. Ray and the B.B. band fully recruited jam an shake it up on \\"Shake Your Tail Feather.\\" That is one of the best musical numbers ever in this film. There are people dancing in the streets and doing dances as Ray calls them off. Listen to the driving bass line. If that doesn't have you up and moving, you've lost the rhythm. Their first gig is unappointed and is at a country bar. They start on \\"Gimme Some Lovin\\" but the crowd grows angry. So they decideto \\"Rawhide\\" and \\"Stand By Your Man,\\" which calms them down, sort of. The real \\"Good Ole Boys\\" arrive later and try to get back at the Brothers. Their real gig that's going to draw in the money is at a huge 5,000-seat auditorium. Cab Calloway and the band entertain the audience with \\"Minnie the Moocher\\". Watch when the song gets faster and Calloway scat sings with audience repeating the scats. Fun and funny. The Brothers finally arrive and the band plays \\"I Can't Turn You Loose.\\" Oh, yeah, watch for an audience member similing directly at the camera. Look at me! They cut loose on \\"Everybody Needs Someone To Love\\". Oh, man, hot stuff! After the \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" number, a record deal is made and they escape without being seen but bump into Jake's furious girlfriend (Carrie Fisher) and it's back to Chicago with the money with Nazis led by Henry Gibson, and a huge police force hot on their trail. Those are what enemies these pair of Robin Hoods make on the way. Watch the car stunts in this huge chase scene and the mammoth number of policmen, SWAT and armed forces clamoring into the destational office building. UNREAL! It's only a movie and they sure went all out on this with a mountain of a budget, but it paid off at the box office. What started out as a Saturday Night Live sketch became one of the most popular movies ever. For all music lovers; this has one of the most musically diverse soundtracks from blues to gospel to soul to R&B to latin to rock to country and even classical. Look out for the falling Pinto! Most memorable for the music. They made it fun and you'll be smiling and dancing through the musical numbers. Electrifying! \\"I need you, you, you...\\"
B00008J4P5|1.0|Beyond the cadaver-esque \\"look\\" and the hype, what is the appeal of this? Terrible musicianship is not cool, it's pathetic. And they're already recycling riffs from their last album???!!! Sad.
B0007P3582|2.0|It seems that the diabolic trio (Dre, Eminem, and 50 cent)  are having some rough years.  Eminem first came out with \\"Encore\\", an album that might as well have been just a remake of everything good about \\"The Eminem Show\\".  Then, 50 comes out with his latest, \\"The Massecre\\", which has just thrown the train off the tracks and into a hurdling ball of fire.<br /><br />\\"The Massecre\\" is a fine example of 50, who must think he is unstoppable, showcasing one of his greatest marketing techniques, controversy.  Listening to this album is very irritating because 50 states in his song \\"Disco Inferno\\" the following line: \\"don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'\\"  Does he even know what he is saying in his songs?  I bring up the question because in the quite luminous song \\"Piggy Bank\\", 50 goes after everyone from Fat Joe to Lil Kim, to even a plugg in on Michael jackson.  So, can you say, hypocrite?<br /><br />As for the album, 50 sells one of the most horrible music of this time.  Why?  Because everything on the album has already been said, has already been talked about, its all already been done.  50 just says what he has already told us on \\"Get Rich Or Die tryin\\", something that gets boring and repetitive, especially after 22 songs.<br /><br />\\"Candy Shop\\", a song that has no meaning or real effort put into it, is the best example of why 50 has gone from street to commercial music, just for money.  Greed seems to be driving him these days.  And when listening to the album, you get a sense that 50 is only 15 years old, as he sits around and bashes everyone he can think of.  Woman, famous rap artists, etc.  The sad thing is, everyone has grown up and moved on from that phase, except him.  50 cent is like Michael Jackson, a child trapped in a mans body.<br /><br />So, to summarize everything, \\"The Massecre\\" is just commercial crap at its best.  Its a shame becasue on \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\", you got the sense that 50 has had struglle and determination to get where he is.  Youknow that he has come from a very hard street life and is determined to make it.  However, on \\"The Massecre\\", you just come to find out that 50's ego is larger than imaginable, and what could possible lead to his demise. At least Eminem has grown up and matured some over the years, maybe 50 should take a lesson......
B0006GAOBI|1.0|Terrible acting, no pacing, incoherent tone, incoherent script, obscenely self-important and humorless (except for a patheticly Tarantino-esque pop-cult conversation about Smurfs)...  <br /> <br /> <br />What is the appeal of this movie beyond the hype?

0399143904|5.0|Tom Clancy is the most talented author of the modern times. He writes novels that combine entertaining action and suspense with a lot of realism. They can be long, but are very much worth it. The characters are all very human and their personalities are flushed out in great detail. The plot is great as always: a team of radical environmentalists decide that the human race is destroying the planet, and must be removed. Therefore, they have created a virus called Shiva that they will spread all over the world (with an anti-virus exclusively for them) starting with the summer games. Meanwhile, John Clark, the ex-Navy SEAL introduced in Clancy's previous novels has started a new top-secret international counterterrorism commando unit code-named Rainbow (for the rainbow of different nations involved) headed by him, a coupla British guys from the SAS, and his son-in-law and ex-Army Ranger Domingo Chavez. There is also an ex-KGB officer who unknowingly works for the environmentalists, and is handed tasks of terrorism designed to keep peacekeeping forces busy. Rainbow deals with these threats, each one growing in severity, effectively, but suspense is kept up not only during the missions but afterwards as they try to discover the reason for these attacks for themselves and stop these biological terrorists before its too late. A highly entertaining read for anyone who is willing to read it (after all, it is a lot to read). I highly recommend it.
B000089CPF|5.0|Could it be: GOOD... NEW... MUSIC???!!!!! Hallelujah!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br />Just when you thought there wasn't any good new popular music, along comes Calexico with the best album (thus far) of their career. Great stuff. Keep up the good work, boys.
B0007O38F8|3.0|of course there's the expected controversy to go through with this release, which caused the bootleging, which caused the release to be moved up 5 days (however in the intro it still feels kinda empty with that girl saying \\"happy valentines day\\") and I know that everybody has their opinions on the 50 vs. nas, jada, fat joe and 50 dismissing the game, and the game's hits, and G-unit in general but here's what i think of the situations. <br /> <br />1 Piggy Bank) Yeah it's weak. The beat is fire but everybody knew what people lyrically expected of 50 now around 6 years in the game. With all the hype I was just waiting to hear this (even though I'm a fan of all the MC's he dissed on this track) however I got very disappointed. I know they all can destroy him but it's a matter of how much they put into it. Will the real massacre begin April 26th, as Fat Joe said? <br /> <br />2 The game) I like the dude (and I'll review his CD soon) however I don't think 50 cent should have dismissed him. As much as Yayo shined on this CD I think Game is the best member of G-Unit and I was hoping this was just a rumor. <br /> <br />3 the album itself) <br /> <br />Anyway, this album isn't all that. Either the reviews say 'Overrated, horrible, produced for the masses drivel' or 'Stop hating, he did it again'. Well, mine doesn't say that because some of the songs are great. 'gatman and robin' is a great theme-fueled track featuring eminem, who spits some of his best lyrics since 02 (although I really wish he would stop calling D12 D twizzy.) 'disco inferno' is hot, as well as 'position of power' with its piano loop and the remix to 'hate it or love it.' 'my toy soldier' also has a nice verse contribution of Tony Yayo. <br /> <br />however it's not all good. 'gunz come out' has one of the worst Dre beats I have ever heard, and I like him as a producer. the country-fueled-ness of 'get in my car' doesn't work either. and 50 saying 'you know how I grind/you know that I shine' in every other song gets tired as well, as well as the few obligatory I'm-from-the-hood songs, however the opening track 'in my hood' is a highlight. <br /> <br />we'll hear from stat quo, obie trice, proof & bizzare this year, plus tony yayo, olivia, and lloyd banks from G-unit (I respect Buck for taking another year to work on his sophomore album) and that should be enough for any Shady fan. 50 should come back in '07 or '08 and drop a classic album. however he'll never do that unless he starts improving his lyrical skills to the likes of 'baltimore love thing' (which is by the way, the best song on the album.) <br /> <br />here's hoping
B0007O38F8|5.0|Here's my review: <br /> <br />1. \\"Intro\\" <br />2. \\"In My Hood\\" 2/5 The rhyme construction is good but the lyrical content is a bit too heavy and the chorus is dragging. <br />3. \\"This Is 50\\" 2/5 This song is just kinda broing and all he talks about it what he buys and it doesn't seem to go anywhere. <br />4. \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" 5/5 The beat and backgroung have an excellent sound and the rhyme is hot. It's glaringly apparent this is a track produced by Eminem. <br />5. \\"Piggy Bank\\" 4/5 I like the beat and the lyrical content but after hearing Jay-z Turnover and Eminem blast people on tracks this pales in comparison. It almost seems like 50 created beef just to have a little controversy surround his album...Free publicity. <br />6. \\"Gatman and Robbin\\" ft. Eminem 5/5 This song is hot the rhyme is perfect and the idea surrounding it is awesome. Eminem's verse is definitely the best part of the track. <br />7. \\"Candy Shop\\" ft. Olivia 5/5 Good club tune Funkyish beat with a sexy and catchy chorus. <br />8. \\"Outta Control\\" 5/5 Amazing beat the slowly pulls you in, another good club track. <br />9. \\"Get In My Car\\" 4/5 Good Chorus and the ryhme is pretty good but I just feel the beat could be better. There is a line where 50 blasts Vivica Fox. <br />10. \\"Ski Mask Way\\" 3/5 just average song seems like filler. <br />11. \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" 5/5 Interesting Beat and very slick rhyme. Nice Chorus <br />12. \\"Ryder Music\\" 4/5 Chill Song, slick rhymes.Chorus a little weak. <br />13. \\"Disco Inferno\\" 5/5 Awesome Beat, slick rhyme great club song all around. <br />14. \\"Just A Lil Bit\\" 5/5 Hot beat, clam chorus that works well with the feel of the song. <br />15. \\"Gunz Come Out\\" 5/5 Awesome song very forified and commanding. <br />16. \\"My Toy Soldier\\" ft. Tony yayo 4/5 Good Beat but the chorus is practically invisible and the song really doesn't go anywhere. <br />17. \\"Position of Power\\" 5/5 Good Beat and the chorus and bridge are both catchy and smooth flowing. <br />18.\\"Build You Up\\" ft. Jamie Foxx 5/5 Different song then what I'd expect from 50 but it's bizarely catchy and Jamie foxx is always awesome. <br />19. \\"God Gave Me Style\\" 5/5 Cool song, great chorus and a nice lay back feel from the beat. <br />20. \\"So Amazing\\" ft. Olivia 5/5 The chorus is awesome and I love Olivia's second camio on the record. <br />21. \\"I Don't Need Em\\" 1/5 The beat sucks although it seems like it's about to get better throughout the entire song. The lyrical content is just a rant by 50 that isn't that good. \\"You's a Busta\\"...naahhhh not really feelin this song it's the worst on ther album <br />22. \\"Hate It or Love It remix\\" ft. G-unit 5/5 Good song with a cool message of the underdogs. <br />5 stars overall
B00005JMXX|4.0|This movie was great as i saw it thrice in a theeter and once at home, partly because other people hadnt seen it and wanted to see it with me. Great effects.. The wolves freaked me out cuz they looked so real and i basically hated wolves after the movie.. The effects was just awesome from the very beginning to the very end...
B0007O38F8|5.0|i ditched class to wait in line for this cd, and it was worth it. just like alot of people, i thought it was ok at first but when you listen to it again, it is perfect. how could you not give it a good rating.the reason why i give it a perfect is because dre didnt even have a hand on this and 50 still found a way to produce something that people can bump in their cars. my favorite songs are: i'm suppised to die tonight, out of control, just a little bit, and hate it or love it(remix). i will buy every album that 50 cent is associated with because he is the real deal and he knows how to make that money. g-unit 4 life
B0002XNSY0|4.0|A byproduct of the cold war is that it provided Hollywood with enough fodder to celebrate espionage in a string of political thrillers. Some took the threat of Russian invasion quite seriously. Others chose a less credible, but wholly more satisfying route into pure farcical escapist entertainment. Of particular interest in this latter category is Stanley Kubrick's intense black comedy about the nuclear age; &quot;Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb.&quot; &quot;The film, frequently adorning &quot;all-time best&quot; lists, is a vapid spoof that teeters on political insanity and military incredulity. The story begins as homage to the Cubin Missile Crisis, with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), an obsessed relic, launching his own personal assault on Communism. Ripper commissions a squadron of B-52s to bomb the USSR. Naturally, the big bad Russians launch their own counter offensive - the so- called &quot;Doomsday Device.&quot; While the world holds its excess gas, U.S. President (Peter Sellers) enters into riotous hot-line negotiations with his Commi-counterpart. Always fascinating to watch, Sellers also interjects his own inimitable brand of craziness into two more roles; a British military attaché with a humorous tick and the psychotic bomb-maker, Dr. Strangelove. This trio of psychotics is fleshed out by Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants loose canon whose military advice boils down into two parts mass hysteria and one part factoid meaningless statistics. <br />This is the third outing for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; on DVD. As with its predecessors, this disc exhibits a just above average  visual presentation. Working backward from second and third generation elements, blacks are sometimes velvety deep and smooth. There is some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but nothing that will distract you from enjoying this classic. There's also alot of film grain. Multiple aspectratios are in keeping with the film's original theatrical presentation. The movie also boasts 5.1 DTS. This 40th anniversary edition also embellishes its extras made previously available with two more short subjects. Overall, there's little reason to run out and re-buy this title, although die hard fans will ultimately want the very latest from the military board room in the cockpit of their own libraries. Either way, brace yourself - its blast off time for the neurotic age!
0783235380|4.0|The traveling plot seemed like a take-off of 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles' - traveling from NY to Savannah vs traveling from Chicago to NY. Same sequence: airplane delays, then train occurrence, then bus, then jalopy-type car. But, since I totally enjoyed the Steve Martin movie, I also enjoyed 'Forces of Nature'. The writer even threw in some weather and fire, same as 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles'. Because of the similarities, I rated it four stars instead of five.    I thought the movie was cute and I like both Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck. I saw the movie as being typical of infatuation with a good-looking person to whom we've been thrown together with for a brief unlikely encounter and of indecisiveness prior to the marrage ceremony , but Ben was, indeed, committed to his fiance and to his future, which was a positive attribute on his behalf.    Unlike some other reviewers who stated commitment was void, I felt it was very much stated in this movie, in spite of other's around them having their own relationships fall apart.    Sarah's life was to be her son and her relationship with him - to build it up after some years of absence. The movie ended correctly. Everyone got what they wanted.

B0001NBMEE|4.0|Director, Henry Hathaway's film version of cartoonist, Hal Foster's Scandinavian hero, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; is one of those over-blown, wacky-tacky epics that is impossible to take seriously, but so much fun to watch. Robert Wagner is the rather effeminate looking title character who takes Camelot by storm. Determined to regain his own throne, Valiant uncovers the treachery of the Black Knight (James Mason, in a toss away role) and challenges him. Of course, there's also time for love with bombshell, Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh - who quite often found herself squeezed into a corset during her 1950s film tenure.) The film veers between comic book pulp and self-conscious seriousness, but Hathaway's direction ensures that neither become the vice to sink his epic. Brian Aherne (as a credible King Arthur)and Sterling Hayden (a not so credible, Sir Gawain) costar.<br />THE TRANSFER: Pretty good. Colors are generally bold, vibrant and well balanced. Flesh tones seem a bit pasty but that's in keeping with early Cinemascope/Eastman color dye transfers. Shadow, contrast and black levels are generally solid. Rear projection photography is more obvious than it should be. Pixelization and edge enhancement are present but do not terribly distract. The audio is 5.1, delivering a nice spread in the music tracks. Dialogue is not natural sounding, but again, this was usually to be expected for the vintage of the film.<br />EXTRAS: Sorry. Nothing but the film.<br />BOTTOM LINE: This prince is worth a second glance, but its not quite as glamorous as, say &quot;Scaramouche&quot; so much as it belongs as the bottom half of a double bill at your old-time drive in.
0316666343|1.0|This book is the very reason I avoid 'popular' novels. I had heard so much good about it, that I rushed out to get it and started reading it on the way home. <br />I admit, the few few chapters were really good, and I liked the writting style, then it started to get slow, and slower and started to drag on. <br />I usually finish a book in a few days, and this one took me a month. There was no reason to read it, cause it was boring, and I didn't like the characters.  <br />Not to mention the horrible ending.  <br />
B0001GF2DS|5.0|&quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot; is Sergio Leone's ultimate spaghetti western with a plot centered on a gold treasure buried in a cemetary. It stars Clint Eastwood as the &quot;Man With No Name&quot; a gunfighter in the amoral/lawless American west who engages in actions that are not always legal, but never wrong. Naturally, Eastwood butts heads with Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef); a murderer without a conscience, and Tuco (Eli Wallach); a conflicted bandit who remains beyond redemption. Like most of Leone's great masterworks, visual style and long stretches of seemingly silent moments tell far more than any amount of dialogue could. Thus, the film is a rare example in which style is transformed into substance.<br />THE TRANSFER: The previously issued DVD of this film was excessively troubled by age related artifacts and a non-anamorphic transfer. Although we have been given an enhanced 16X9 transfer this time - the age related artifacts are still present - if slightly tempered. Colors remain dated, though, unlike the previous incarnation, are not as faded. Many scenes remain softly focused with minimal grit and dirt. The Techniscope widescreen process (an absolutely inferior widescreen format)dillutes the film images. The &quot;restored&quot; scenes are not terribly well integrated into the film. At one point the entire image turns jaundice yellow, which is obtrusive to say the least! Fine details and definition are sometimes poorly rendered, that its best to say that this visual presentation is true to its shoddy original film stock. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 but is nevertheless strident and very unnatural sounding.<br />EXTRAS: Audio commentary that is very informative, and several fine documentaries about Leone, the film's composer -Ennio Morricone, the civil war and the Leone's style. Also, some deleted scenes.<br />BOTTOM LINE: This is by far the best that the film has looked on any home video format. But the improvements, while substantial, still do not bring the video quality of this presentation up to par with films of the same or similar vintage.

B0006Z2KX4|5.0|&quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;(1938) is the adventageous screwball comedy about a madcap New England heiress, Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) who, after accidentally running into stuffy zoologist, David Huxley (Cary Grant) is determined to land him as her husband. Not that David would notice. He's too concerned with acquiring a bone for his museum collection - go figure. But a gregarious little terrier named George (actually Asta from &quot;The Thin Man&quot; series) intervenes in David's plans, burying the irreplaceable fossilized bone somewhere on Sue's country estate. Meanwhile Baby, Susan's leopard, threatens the whole show by tearing up the scenery, as leopard's will do, after escaping from her cage. Naturally the whole mess winds up in front of a local magestrate, who lacks the ability to put two ideas together and come up with one coherant thought. The supporting cast is a who's who of crazies, including Charles Ruggles as Major Applegate, a pompous big game hunter, May Robson as Sue's dotty rich aunt, Elizabeth Random, and Barry Fitzgerald as the congenial scatterbrain, Mr. Gogarty. Director, Howard Hawks infuses his artistic mileau with every screwball gag in the book - and a few never before seen - illiciting the overwhelming and riotous laugh a minute that has made &quot;Baby&quot; one of the unique highlights in film comedy history. Not that anyone knew it at the time. On the contrary, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; was widely panned by the critics and did only modest box office on its initial release. But hey, what did they know? Time has proven that &quot;Baby&quot; is the one to beat; a high water mark of comedic prowess that only the likes of someone like Preston Sturges could hope to match. <br />Warner's 2-disc special edition of this vintage comedy is a welcomed treat for DVD-philes. The black and white image is astoundingly solid. The gray scale has been impeccibly mastered from very clean film elements. Contrast levels are superb. There's a hint ofedge enhancement now and then, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are fully realized. Film grain is kept to a bare minimum. Aside from the very thorough commentary track by Peter Bogdanovich, disc 2 of this DVD contains two feature length documentaries; one on Howard Hawks, the other on Cary Grant. There's also a couple of vintage short subjects and a gallery of trailers from other Howard Hawk's films. Very nice. Bottom line: &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; is a sheer delight and this new DVD expounds twice the good time in its beautifully rendered picture and sound quality from the good people at Warner Brothers.
B0007O38F8|3.0|50 Cent is a great rapper, but he seems to feel the need to have beef surround his c.d's... This album is by far the most hyped and anticpated c.d since his first one... BUT, it isnt too good.. i mean, he put alot of effort into it, he advertised it to perfection, it has everything a mainstream hip-hop junkie could ever ask for, But its not so good. its VERY repetitve. Baltimore Love Thing is probably the most interesting tracks on this disk, but really this album is quality over content. The beats are amazing, but 50 fails in the lyrically catagory. He sings half the album, and the rest is Guns and Money, and if its not that, its sex and drugs. The Piggybank track, which served as the main attraction, would probably be the worst song on this disk if it wasnt for Ski Mask Way. <br /> <br />But if all your looking for is an Album to get you past until somthing goods comes out, you should get this. Its not a classic, and dont expect it to be either. He's obviously very confident in his work, and feels he is on top, and that can be heard throughout the album. In the first one he was more Humble and Hungry. I give it a 4 out of 5 in production and a 1 out of 5 for lyrics, and that 1 star is for baltimore love thing. <br /> <br />3/5 in total..
B0002KPHXS|4.0|Intermezzo (1939)is the brilliant American adaptation of the Swedish film by the same name. Enamored by her on screen presence in that film, producer David O. Selznick imported Ingrid Bergman to Hollywood; a rare an ever-lasting find that audiences the world over should be eternally grateful for. As in the Swedish version, Bergman plays Anita Hoffman, a gifted piano teacher who comes in contact with violin virtuoso, Holger Brandt (Leslie Howard). Though Selznick wanted Howard in the film, Howard only agreed after Selznick acquiesced to giving him co-producer screen credit for his efforts. Brandt's world tours keep in away from his committed wife, Margit (Edna Best) and children. The realization that his own life is passing him by is spurred on when Brandt discovers that he is falling in love with Anita. A bittersweet Riviera tryst reforms the illicit lovers to their separate destinies. Selznick's impenetrable commitment to top of the line production values and his way of concocting dreamy gloss from human stories, make &quot;Intermezzo&quot; a viscerally moving poignant experience. Bring Kleenex. <br />MGM's DVD is rather impressive. The B&amp;W picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up but pixelization is kept to a minimum. Overall the picture will surely not disappoint. The audio is mono but more than adequate for a film of this vintage. There are no extras.
B0002RNXNM|5.0|I've read some online reviews that slag on this album as being unoriginal or derivative of other bands.  But I say Kasabian sounds better than 99.9% of the so-called \\"original\\" bands out there.  And besides, you're kidding yourself if you think The Strokes or White Stripes are anything but derivative. <br /> <br />Kasabian is a welcome update of the late 80's/early 90's Madchester sound.  The album is absolutely flawless from beginning to end, and I can say that about VERY few that I've heard or purchased in recent years.  Trust me, I would never take the time to write a review unless I truly felt this way.     <br /> <br />The critics can have their totally-esoteric-Icelandic-electro-atmospheric-flavor-of-the-week-BS. I'll take Kasabian any day.
6304696566|3.0|John Ford was a master craftsman of the American cinema. Though he dabbled in melodrama and action during his directorial career, his everlasting contribution to the movies remains in those galvanic distillations of the old west put forth by an unparalleled series of legendary films. &quot;The Searchers&quot; ranks among his most finely wrought and meticulously hand crafted projects. Indeed it seems to be the film in which the culmination of Ford's own commitment to the power, beauty and frailty of the western frontier tragically come together in a revisionist perspective that exposes both its grandeur and its flaws. The film stars the iconic John Wayne as Ethan Edwards - a strangely majestic antihero who vows bloody revenge after his cousin and family are slaughtered by marauding Comanches. But Ethan's search for his surviving niece (Natalie Wood) becomes a sinister and all-consuming obsession when he learns that she - having been abducted while still a child - has now adopted the ways of her captors and, at least in Ethan's mind, has become one of them. The film tackles racism in the form of Ethan's distrust of one time family friend (Jeffrey Hunter) who is part Cherokee and the sweep and spectacle of Death Valley has never been quite so poignantly captured on film.<br />THE TRANSFER: While Warner Home Video has made &quot;The Searchers&quot; available in anamorphic widescreen in a print that is light years ahead of anything the film has looked like before for the home film enthusiast, compared to more current DVD releases, the visual splendor of the transfer falls short of expectations. Though colors are rich there's something of a muddiness and lack of balance to them in many of the indoor scenes. Also, several scenes appear to be suffering slightly from color shrinkage, creating a slightly out of focus image quality that is distracting. Age related artifacts are present but do not distract so much as the digital anomalies of pixelization and edge enhancement which greatly plague the background information in most of the long shots. A slight shimmering is inherent in all of the scenes. Black and contrast levels can be solid at times, while sometimes appearing slightly pasty. Ditto for the unnatural flesh tones which are either overly pink or a ruddy orange. The audio has been remastered and delivers a nice expansive presentation which is in keeping with the vintage of the original sound elements.<BR>EXTRAS: Not this time around. Sadly, this film deserves a documentary.<br />BOTTOM LINE: &quot;The Searchers&quot; is a masterful western, on par with &quot;Stagecoach&quot; and &quot;High Noon&quot;. Definitely one to add to your film library.
B000065U1N|4.0|BLACK HAWK DOWN is Ridley Scott's and Jerry Bruckheimer's cinematization of author Mark Bowden's phenomenally dynamic retelling of the Battle of Mogadishu (October 1993) in which 100 U.S. peacekeeping troops tasked to neutralize Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid were attacked by thousands of armed Somalis. I have never seen a book translated to film so faithfully.<br /><br />The film, like the book, is riveting and disturbing. From its opening scenes of malnourished Somali corpses to its closing moments as we discover the fate of the soldiers involved in the operation, BLACK HAWK DOWN never falters in its depiction of warfare as the collective fate of individuals: \\"You fight for the guy beside you.\\"<br /><br />What the Somalis fought for is less clear, and why they fought the Americans at all seems at first glance to be a puzzle; that is, until the American incursion is seen through Somali eyes, not as a peacekeeping mission but as an incursion against the Somali social bulwarks of clan and faith. Their rage is palpable, and if only a very few Somali voices are heard  castigating the U.S. for its role in BLACK HAWK DOWN, the scenes of mob violence speak their own language. The ongoing battle scene that makes up most of this film is so relentless that it is disorienting, but such is the true nature of war.<br /><br />Aidid and his minions were able to inflame such a vast proportion of the population that it appears that the entire city of one million is gunning for the pinned down Rangers. And as with any mob, mindlessness is the rule. As the Americans battle their way out of Mogadishu none of the Somalis decides to engage them in an intellectual discussion.<br /><br />But in showing us the battle BLACK HAWK DOWN asks why, and the answers are not comforting for Americans, used, as we are to a global perspective. The lessons of Somalia seem self-defeating. Better a bloody violence than a peace with one's enemies. Better a tinhorn tribal warlord than a paternalistic U.N. delivering food and medicine. Better the clan and tribe than the nation and the world. Better to die than to tolerate one's enemies.<br /><br />Somalia today is a failed state, broken into innumerable tribal territories. It is a fate which even the best-intentioned action could not have avoided. That is the lesson of BLACK HAWK DOWN.rnalistic U.N. delivering food and medicine. Better the clan and tribe than the nation and the world. Better to die than to tolerate one's enemies. <br /> <br />Somalia today is a failed state, broken into innumerable tribal territories. It is a fate which even the best-intentioned action could not have avoided. That is the lesson of BLACK HAWK DOWN.
B0002OXVDW|4.0|Upon its release &quot;That's Entertainment!&quot; became the biggest and brightest money maker of 1974...and it's no wonder. For a little over two hours one had the enchanted experience of being teleported to a world just this side of over the rainbow. Here is a cornucopia of magical scenes and snippets from MGM's most magnificent musicals. Directed with adroit - if self congratulatory - wit and concision by Jack Haley Jr. (son of Oz's Tin Man), &quot;That's Entertainment!&quot; is the sort of blindingly spellbinding extravaganza that reinforces MGM's once galvanic mottos of &quot;art for art's sake&quot; and &quot;more stars than there are in heaven.&quot; At its gala premiere Jack Haley Sr. was heard declaring, &quot;This isn't nostalgia. This is art.&quot; Rightly so, by 1974 the MGM musical had been dead for some time and the studio itself was on the verge of a restructuring that would ultimately reduce its holdings to garage sale status. But at least in this film such forgotten treasures were resurrected from oblivion to their rightful place in film history. Variety gave &quot;That's Entertainment!&quot; a glowing review, trumpeting, &quot;That while many may ponder the future of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, no one can deny that it's had one heck of a past!&quot; <br />Naturally, MGM just had to have a sequel. Two years later &quot;That's Entertainment II&quot; came out. But David Melnick's follow up was decidedly a let down on several levels. First, it removed the star cameos that so poignantly buttressed the original's vintage clips. Second, it presented the footage in a seemingly hap-hazard chronology. And finally, it interrupted the musical performances with a showcase from some of the studio's non-musical performers in a string of disjointed word play that neither enhanced the memory of their original performances or the film experience that was to be had. Though not nearly as successful as its predecessor, &quot;That's Entertainment II&quot; was nevertheless a box office titan. <br />In 1994 MGM once again revisited its vaults for &quot;That's Entertainment III&quot; the final installment in the series. But by now the experience was vaguely beginning to resemble grave robbing. The new film's primary selling feature was that, in addition to showcasing another round of classic performances, it also dug deep into the coffers of outtakes for a series of deleted musical numbers which, until 1994, had either never or rarely been seen. Despite these innovations the final installment to the trilogy was the one most poorly received. It's the original that continues dazzle us all and it's the original that remains the cornerstone of this newly minted DVD box set. <br />Warner's DVD transfers of all three &quot;That's Entertainment!&quot; films is a welcomed delight. After years of viewing parts one and two with poorly mastered vintage clips, these newly minted discs appear to have been the benefactors of some digital restoration. Beginning with the original film, there is a decide lack of grain and grit on this transfer that is most becoming. Colors (during the Technicolor clips) are vibrant, rich and deep. B&amp;W images are very crisp, nicely balanced, with an often stunning gray scale and superior attention to fine details. There is only the slightest amount of edge enhancement for a picture that is very smooth. The audio has been remixed and remastered to stereo for all three films. Part II seems to suffer from slightly lower contrast levels overall, but the same review for Part I applies. The most outstanding example of digital mastering comes in Part III - a marvelously vibrant array of clips remastered (as they were for the theatrical engagement) in high def that positively glows off the screen. The audio is 5.1 surround and is remarkably aggressive throughout. <br />Extras include a bonus disc of musical outtakes and extras, audio only catalogue of songs and dances, the original footage of the LA premiere with all of the oldtime musical stars in attendance and a series of short subjects that collectively perform like a documentary on the series. There are also the original theatrical trailers for each film to be had. In the immortal words of George Gershwin...&quot;who could ask for anything more?&quot;
0694003611|3.0|I got this book after hearing so much about it and I must admit---I don't \\"get it\\".  I don't understand the love or the hype over this book.  I find it terribly boring, and don't particularly find the illustrations very interesting. Call me crazy....
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is the album we all knew one day would come, and that day is today.  At The Drive In is finished, and it took this cd for Mars Volta to really explode into their own personality.  This cd is a concept cd about a diary they found in a car a year back - listen to the lyrics and you will understand.  It is progressive yet catchy in the style that the great progressive artists (pink floyd, etc) can only do.  I highly recommend.
B00005OC0G|5.0|Mutter provides us with another stunning interpretation of the most transcendental Violin Concerto of all time. Unlike her contemporaries, she never looks at this concerto from a purely violinistic standpoint. As learned from Karajan, she looks only from an \\"eagle's eye view\\". So call it mannered, call it showboating, but you can never deny the transcendental depth, that she probes into this music. Simply stunning. <br /> <br />Thanks, Mutter!!
B0002UOK04|5.0|last Night i went and got this CD strictly on impulse. <br />I could tell by the artist it was Finnish & my favorite  <br />genre is Finnish metal, so I picked it up and noticed  <br />it was a Nuclear Blast release.. hell yeah. <br /> <br />i didnt really know what to expect, but i was  <br />already amazed after listening to the first song. <br />It's like you're listening to Rhapsody and Children <br />of Bodom at the same time, which is sooo cool. <br />all the musical elements used in this production are  <br />great. <br /> <br />there was not one track on here that I hated, they <br />are all really good and extremely catchy. my <br />favorite song is Sleeping Stars, the tempo changes <br />in the quickness and the ochestral work is simply <br />flawless. Wintersun is not well-known, but should  <br />be without a doubt. this is a definite must-have for <br />any Finnish metal lover. <br /> <br />You should also check out: <br /> <br />Rhapsody- Tales From the Emerald Sword Saga <br />Children of Bodom- Hatebreeder <br />Black Majesty- Sands of Time
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I actively hate \\"prog\\" rock, so I don't know what you call this - but it's an amazing swirl of rock, funk, latin, jazz....sure some of the transitions are too long, and sometimes they abandon a great groove when maybe they shouldn't, but this is a work of art in the best and least pretentious sense of the word.  The more you listen to it, the more rewarding it becomes.  I can't stop listening to L'Via L'Viaquez...makes me want to turn the volume to 11 every time I hear it (esp. the drums....WICKED).  As one reviewer said, strap yourself in & enjoy the ride.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I first saw him on Austin City Limits and was hooked.  Ran out and got O.  I honestly listen to it over and over.  It is so moving...everything...the music, the lyrics, the voice - the voice - the voice.  I may need a 'twelve step program' to get free.
B00008EY65|4.0|Sorry bout the corny title... I am a punster at heart.  This movie was an excellent comic book adaptation. I think that too many folks are expecting everything to be handed to them in their movie experiences these days.  With sci-fi, fantasy and this type of movie... sometimes we have to give a little as the audience too.  I think this movie gave just enough background to paint the palette and let us use our imagination to fill in the rest of the story universe.  The story (for the most part) stayed true to the comic and was decipherable with a minimum of effort.  It was easy to be sympathetic to Hellboy and to know who the good and bad guys were.  And in the end, isn't that what we want from this kind of movie... a little ethical conflict tossed in with some great butt whipping emotional release???  Just my two cents.  Last thought - this may not have had the special effects or gloss of x-men or other movies, but I thought the story line and acting carried the movie just fine.. A good movie in which to invest a Friday or Saturday evening!
B00005J6SZ|3.0|Previously to this album, Madonna released a self titled album, which wasn't too big until this album hit the market.<br />This is the album which made Madonna a star and a worldwide name.<BR>This is the album that gave her first US #1 hit out of her 12. That hit was none other than the title track &quot;like a virgin.&quot; Almost controversial being that her name is Madonna... But it worked!<BR>It also spawned off a hit which would give her the name which she would later regret to have and rebel against. Material Girl, which had a rockier edge to it while remaining an 80s pop anthem. <BR>Other hits include Dress You Up, and Angel. <BR>During this era Madonna was big but was still in heavy competition with none other with Cyndi Lauper. In that time they said Cyndi would outlast Madonna do to her better voice.<BR>So much for that, as Madonna had become a marketing genius to be reackoned with.<BR>This was also the era when Madonna made her big screen appearance with &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan,&quot; which spawned off an 80s anthem and arguably her greatest dance hit, &quot;Into the Groove.&quot; Into the Groove is famous for being the b-side to &quot;Angel&quot; rather than the #1 hit it was destined to be. Although it could never chart, it still managed to get massive radio airplay and is still recognized as a huge success for Madonna.<br />Although this album made Madonna a huge success, aside from the singles, a lot of weak songs are present. Pretender and Shoo Bee Doo just don't stand out and aren't that great. <BR>Over and Over is catchy, but still very shallow and not too inspired. &quot;Stay&quot; however, is a great song with a great heavy sound and great lyrics.<BR>All in all this album doesn't deserve more than a 3 out of 5.

B0007G89G4|5.0|STAND BY ME- a golden movie.  It is the story told in flashback by an adult form of one of the main characters, and set in the late 50's.  Four boys, Chris Chambers (played by the magnificently talented River Phoenix) Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern tessio (Jerry O'Connel) decide to sneak off from their sleepy Oregon town to find the body of a missing boy their own age.  Along the way they get through leeches, an evil tempered junkyard man and his dog, and numerous way-too-close train encounters.  The film is full of all those little details, like old song tunes and show jingles, that make a movie classic. <br />All four boys are varying misfits, so there's the dynamic of their personal struggles as well as that of four 13 yr old boys hiking through the wilderness of Oregon.  With a wonderful core cast, and a supporting cast of Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, and Bradley Gregg. <br />I remeber my brother and all his friends watching this movie when they were little, and me, even smaller, just watching quietly from a corner.  The movie always stuck in my mind.  I love STAND BY ME; so skin it.  Deffinately check this movie out.   <br />
B000660UN0|2.0|Yes, we all know these songs are sub-standard renderings of Johnson's material. The added acoustic element of the CD+DVD package bumps up the value for money (slightly), but it is still somewhat dull.    I'd like to concentrate here upon the DVD. Firstly, the conceit of having Clapton visit the sites of Johnson's recording sessions is interesting - if you didn't see John Hammond do it back in 1990 for his documentary 'The Search for Robert Johnson'. Clapton labours for authenticity, but the sight of him being handed guitars by his guitar techs and aides, and the undoubted preparation that went into his recording in the dilapidated warehouse district building, just seems so staged and - to be honest - so pig rich, that it irks. In Hammond's documentary, he is filmed playing in a railroad sidecar, on the streets, at crossroads (!) and the Gunter Hotel - just him and his National. It's a more honest depiction of how Johnson would have presented his music in the everyday, without the help of an entourage. (And Hammond seems to handle all the parts of Johnson's guitar work fine - debunking Clapton's insistence that he play with another guitarist [Doyle Bramhall II] in order to 'capture' the full range of what Johnson was doing).     Clapton also needs to accept a little bit more of the so-called 'revisionist' work of authors like Elijah Wald, who does a terrific job in his 'Escaping the Delta' of providing some much needed context to Robert Johnson's work. Clapton also needs to publicly state that Johnson was very much a product of records as much as everyday experience and the so-called 'juke joints': he openly lifted entire arrangements from other players that came before him. His music did not spring fully formed from his own fingers.      So, be wary of this release. The additional DVD is certainly intended to bump up sales ('Me and Mr. Johnson' is already being tossed out for $9 at my local music store), and the acoustic material is nice to listen to given the quality of the guitars, but I'd recommend John Hammond's 'The Search for Robert Johnson' if you want some general background to Johnson, and even his own CD ('At the Crossroads: Blues of Robert Johnson') which collect's Hammonds attempts at recording Johnson over the years (recordings that indeed pre-date Clapton's 60s Johnson work).     But, of course, the real place to go is the new releases of 'The King of the Delta Blues' (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2), which will give you Johnson as he's never been heard before. After that, the later, mid-90s release of 'The Complete Recordings' will give you all the alternate takes so far located.    So, this CD + DVD is best heard - and seen - once. Then discarded. Like bubblegum.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Buy it and be amazed. You won't be bored with this one.
B0000029AP|4.0|This was a pretty good album. I mean it's one of Aerosmith's best <br />records of all time, i tell you most of the tracks were good. <br />My favorites on this album were Adams Apple, Walk This Way, Big <br />Ten Inch Record, & Sweet Emotion. I also recommend Get Your Wings <br />in addition to this album.  <br /> <br />1. Toys in the attic: 3/5 Kinda repeats itself.  <br /> <br />2. Uncle salty: 3/5 Not much to say but okay and good. <br /> <br />3. Adams apple: 4/5 This was a really cool track. It rocks. <br /> <br />4. Walk this way: 5/5 Instant classic. One of their hits <br /> <br />5. Big Ten Inch Record: 4/5 Good but not the greatest. <br /> <br />6. Sweet Emotion: 7/5 One of the best songs ever. <br /> <br />7. No More No More: 2/5 Nothing to say on this. <br /> <br />8. Round N Round: 3/5 Not too good. But to say it's not to much <br />heavy as Sweet Emotion or Walk This Way. <br /> <br />9. You See Me Cryin': 2/5 This is the weakest song on the whole <br />cd.  <br /> <br />Overall good album.  <br />A must have for any CD collection. <br />Get  <br />Get Your Wings <br />Aerosmith <br />Permanent Vacation
B0007O38F8|3.0|Before reviewing 50's latest effort, I just wanted to say that I think he's acting like a freakin' idiot right now. Dude's seriously looking to get shot. He's got beef with The Game now just because The Game doesn't want to get involved in 50's petty little battles with Jadakiss, Nas, Shyne, and Fat Joe. And the reason 50 hates Jada, Shyne, and Fat Joe are retarded too (Jada and Fat Joe rapped with Ja Rule on \\"New York\\"; Shyne tried to get signed by Murder Inc., Ja's record label).    50's attitude in a nutshell: If you don't hate who I hate, then I hate you too. What is this, the hip-hop version of \\"Mean Girls?\\" C'mon, how old are we?!?!? Now I understand why the guy's been shot 9 times.     Okay, enough with the drama. Let's get to what should be the focus: the music.     The album is pretty hot. But it is not as good as 50's initial release \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\". When I got that album, I loved nearly every song on there and said, \\"Wow, if I didn't download this illegally, this would be worth paying money for!\\" I'm not saying 50's new album is bad. It's just not great. Instead of lovin' all the songs, I'm pretty ambivalent to some. I'm just like, \\"Eh. It's okay.\\"    Maybe the lack of Dre tracks is the reason. 50 complained about how Dre didn't have time to work on his album, 'cause he was busy producing The Game's. I think 50's just whining. Except for Eminem and Hi-Tek, most of the producers on the album I've never heard of. But they do an awesome job with the beats. I thought \\"Disco Inferno\\" was Dre-produced, but it's not (produced by C. Styles and Bang Out). I have no clue who these guys are, but that's a hot beat.     Another standout producer priorly unknown to me was Scott Storch. Yeah, his name's not as flashy-sounding as The Neptunes, Timbaland, Just Blaze, Dr. Dre; he just sounds like some normal, everyday guy. But the man's got beats. They kind of have an Indian flavor to them with some tribal percussion. This is the guy who brought us the sexy rhythmof \\"Candy Shop\\". His stuff makes me wanna run out to the dance floor and shake what my momma gave me.    The song I play 15 times in a row on my iPod is Dre's \\"Outta Control\\". I LOVE THIS FREAKIN' SONG. It's got this driving, pounding rhythm to it, reminiscent of \\"Encore\\" from the same-titled Eminem album. Maybe 50's right; maybe with more Dre, this album would've been better. The only other new Dre track on this album is \\"Gunz Come Out\\". It's not even 1/10th as good as \\"Outta Control\\". I guess Dre felt 1 out of 2 was good enough, and figured 50's grown up enough to handle the rest without him (He's not! 50 needs his mommy!).    Speaking of Eminem, he produces 3 songs here. I was expecting better. At least he's trying to stray a bit from his usual pattern of what I like to call \\"Evil Church Music\\", although not much (\\"Evil Church Music\\" is kinda like the music you'd hear in a movie featuring a creepy church or a funeral. For example, listen to: Jay-Z's \\"Moment of Clarity\\" and \\"Renegade\\", Em's \\"When the Music Stops\\", The Game's \\"We Ain't\\", Em's tracks on 50's last album). He's still stuck on minor chords. Luckily I like songs in minor. \\"I'm Supposed to Die Tonight\\" retains his usual dark sound and slow tempo. It doesn't really do much for me, however. The tempo's slowed down too much, and it makes the song feel dragging.    \\"My Toy Soldier\\" (a reference to Em's song \\"Toy Soldier\\", I'm guessing) does a much better job. It still has a bit of that Evil Church melody, but faster and more intense with fuzzy synths instead of typical churchy instruments (strings, harpsicords, choirs).     I really wish Em guest-rapped more; he only raps on one song, \\"Gatman & Robbin\\".  Here he puts a little twist on the ol' Batman theme song (\\"Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, BATMAN!\\"). I didn't think it was anything special at first. But the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me.    What else is good: The Scott Storch-produced \\"Just a Lil' Bit\\". My only problem with it is it comes immediately after \\"Disco Inferno\\", and the 2 songs are way to similar. Laid-back rhythm, with choruses telling girls to shake that ass. Here, take a look for yourself:    Disco Inferno:  \\"Lil mama, show me how you move it  Better yet, put your back into it  Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it  Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!\\"    Just a Lil Bit:  \\"Damn baby all I need is a lil bit...   A lil bit o' dis a lil bit o' dat  Get crackin' in the club when you hear the sh**  Drop it like it's hot when you're workin' that back  Girl shake that thing yeah work that thing,   Let me see it go up and down  Rotate that thing, I wanna touch that thing when you make it go round and round... \\"    I mean, he could've at least changed it up by throwin' in between them a song about selling crack or buying Escalades or something.    Tha album slows down towards the end. In \\"So Amazing\\", Olivia sings a hook that sounds like the type of thing you'd hear Ashanti and Ja Rule do (I'm sure 50 would appreciate that comment.)    At least the CD ends with a great song, even though it isn't really anything new. \\"Hate It Or Love It\\" is one of my fave tracks from The Game's album, and it makes an appearance here as a remix featuring additional vocals from other G-Unit members. I'll agree with 50 here; I think he owns this song more than The Game does. When I first heard this song on the radio, I thought it was a 50 song featuring The Game. The same goes for \\"How We Do\\" (I am so sick of that freakin' song by the way. I was sick of it way before that album dropped. You know a rap song's been overkilled when they start playing it on Z-100.).    Anyway, my final verdict: It's definitely worth a download. It's definitely iPod-worthy. There's just enough good songs to entice people to buy it, but it's not good enough to make you say it really deserves all of your $12 - $17.     At least he's kinda living up to his name:  50 cents = half a dollar  50's effort = half-ass effort
B000089RV6|5.0|This is AC/DC's best CD. I guarantee that it is. A lot of these <br />songs are really great, I mean you better get this if you are <br />a fan to hard rock/heavy metal like me.  <br /> <br />Hells Bells-Great bells opens a great Angus riff.  <br /> <br />Shoot To Thrill-One of the best songs ever. One of my favorites <br />on this album.  <br /> <br />What Do You Do For Money Honey-The riff rock? Go ahead the beginning in this song is really cool. <br /> <br />Giving the Dog a Bone-Okay now I'm talking to you. This song rocks so hard. The best out of heavy metal dream. This is the <br />best god damn headbanger in the world ever. <br /> <br />Let Me Put My Love Into You-Skip it. <br /> <br />Back In Black-The riff in this song is so awesome. The vocals <br />by Brian arn't to bad. Instant radio classic. <br /> <br />You Shook Me All Night Long-Great song. Delivers the best riff <br />ever. Vocals by Brian are even better. Another instant classic. <br /> <br />Have a Drink on Me-One of my favorites on this album. This is one <br />of the best songs ever. I like Brian in this song. <br /> <br />Overall it's a really good album. <br />Get these albums if you like this. <br /> <br />Appetite for Destruction <br />Nevermind <br />Get Your Wings <br />Toys in the Attic <br />& More.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Before purchasing Frances the Mute, it is good to know that there are technically only five songs on the CD. However, the album goes for about about 72 minutes. Some of the songs, namely the first, fourth, and fifth, are divided up into movements that help make sense of something that otherwise might look frighteningly long, especially if you're the kind of person who doesn't like progressive or experimental music. There are 12 tracks on the CD I got a hold of; the first four songs are counted as one track each, but the fifth (\\"Cassandra Gemini\\") gets a track for each separate movement. However, I have a feeling that, like what happened with Tool's Undertow (69 track/10 track/13 track versions...), there may be a lot of variation on the CD tracking over time, especially as new pressings are made.    \\"Frances the Mute\\" won't be as enjoyable for someone who doesn't like a challenge when first listening to new music. It is not formulaic by any stretch, and some would even brand it self-indulgent in its exploration of musical boundaries. It may well be: after \\"The Widow\\" seemingly finishes, halfway into the track, three additional minutes of ambience ensue that are little more than annoying, at least for the first couple of listens. Like I said, it can be challenging at first. However, I find that music that challenges usually winds up being the most enduring and the most enjoyable.    No track in particular sticks out above the rest on this album, each its own unique statement and feeling. However, they are not a simple amalgam: one can immediately tell that they belong together. \\"Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus\\" is drenched in feral intensity and lust for experience and truth, while \\"L' Via L' Viaquez\\" takes a more tragic look at the album's unfolding plot. \\"The Widow\\" seems inescapably doomed with regret, and \\"Cassandra Gemini\\" (which I was disappointed to find has a strange beeping sound as a signal between each movement, detracting from the overall feel) fights to pull apart the album's psyche after \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" just finished trying to reassemble it. Unfortunately, the song that may have been meant to explain these other five (title track \\"Frances the Mute\\") could not fit on the CD, so it will only be released on the LP and a separate CD at a later date. The Mars Volta dangle the carrot on the stick in front of us by leaving this lost track's lyrics behind the CD in the packaging.     In contrast to previous albums Tremulant and De-loused in the Comatorium, Frances the Mute embraces Cedric and Omar's Spanish influences, where previously it took on the role of artistic backdrop only, never appearing in the forefront of a piece. Not only do many of the lyrics employ liberal use of the Spanish language, but much of the music has embraced the salsa feeling that was almost latent by comparison in previous recordings. This in no way spoils or changes The Mars Volta's sound beyond recognition; in fact, it seems that they have only become more of what they originally were. It is as if this transition in style and writing was inevitable, at least for one album.    Frances the Mute is quite a bit more challenging than previous Mars Volta albums, for both newcomers to and veterans of the band. While the majority of the album is quickly accessible, as a consecutive piece, there is so much transition and ambience that someone unfamiliar with progressive music may feel an intense disgust. However, after only a few listens (as with every good exploratory album) through, most anyone should be able to make sense of the transitional pieces and how they play a role in the dynamics of Frances the Mute. No one should be mistaken: this album may be very beautiful, but it also requires much thought.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the best song ever. I guarantee, this is Nirvana's best <br />album over all. It's so great. There's lots of heavy metal in <br />IN BLOOM, and the greatest vocals ever on SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT, and great guitaring on LITHIUM and more. COME AS YOU <br />ARE, SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT, and LITHIUM are instant classics <br />on this album. I suggest you get this album, I'll recommend you <br />Appetite for Destruction or Use Your Illusion I, if you like <br />this CD.

B000003CKH|4.0|Cake became popular on the university circuit several years ago, but I'd personally never purchased any of their albums prior to this one. But after hearing several sections of this new album being played on NPR while John McCrea (Cake's lead singer) got interviewed, I went out and bought this CD. I felt compelled to hear out the remainder of the songs, and wasn't satisfied with just the few stanzas that were allowed on the radio program/interview. I was particularly drawn to Cake's remake of Gloria Gaynor's \\"I Will Survive\\". This was a song that my mother loved and I found it refreshing to hear it played at a more modern level.<br /><br />Many might call Cake's music new-wave or some form of pop, but to me it sounds like a blending of 50's instrumentation with modern lyrics and a low-down beat, similar to a blues melody.<br /><br />My favorites are the aforementioned \\"I Will Survive\\", \\"Frank Sinatra\\" and \\"Race Car Ya-Yas\\".<br /><br />There are some definite \\"explicit lyrics\\", including a few added to Gaynor's classic (Mom! Close your ears!), but this didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the songs.<br /><br />A cool album. Now I've gotta go out and buy a few of their older one's.
0380973839|4.0|Chronicles is less a novel and more a collection of short stories, some just a single paragraph, tied together by an overall narrative. There are Martians and the planet is portrayed with flowing water and an Earth-like atmosphere. This isn't realistic but it doesn't matter since the planet is a backdrop for the colonization and abandonment of the planet by humans. In fact, the book is mostly a character study of the humans who come to Mars and the impact they have on the planet. Some are adventurers, some idealists, some are just running away from something. <br /> <br />The stories also have a distinctive flair to them and reflect the 1940s in which they where written, several deal with 'atomic war'.
1592400876|4.0|I recently had the honor of editing a portion of a book and found myself wanting for a resource on punctuation. I already had Strunk and White: The Elements of Style, but its lessons are decades old (but still relevant on some levels).<br /><br />To my amazement, one day I opened up my local paper and found Eats, Shoots & Leaves on the national nonfiction best-seller list. A book on punctuation? A best-seller? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's true (Quick! Find a seat if you're feeling faint!).<br /><br />So why is this book an international success?<br /><br />I like to think it's because some readers, writers, editors, and publishers have grown weary of seeing error after error show up in popular literature, billboard signs, grocery store windows, and on homework assignments (I threw that in just for you teachers out there). Ms. Truss calls herself a punctuation stickler; but I don't see it that way. She's simply trying to \\"write\\" (ha-ha)  the wrongs out there! And she's found an effective tool in her new book.<br /><br />Most books on punctuation are bland, barely readable tomes that many-an-author keeps on his/her shelves as a resource guide; flipping to it only when they need a refresher on certain rules (I certainly do this with Strunk and White. Don't you?). But Eats, Shoots & Leaves takes that resource a lot further. Here Lynne Truss moves us into our literary past, showing us when, where, and why such things as the semicolon and the question mark came into use-a fascinating historical recounting you won't find in those \\"other\\" punctuation guides. This book also differs in that the author utilizes some mildly entertaining humor (much of which-unfortunately- will be lost on those who don't know a lot about punctuation to begin with, or are unfamiliar with many British-isms) that keeps the book light and enjoyable without sinking us into the \\"hard and fast rules\\" of punctuation, making it sound like we're being preached to by our eighth grade English teacher.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Ms. Truss' (sorry, but I'm not adding an \\"s\\" onto the end of her name) ability to give us the various rules, the history behind them, the rationale for their use, and then tell us that, sometimes, there is no right or wrong way; just differences of opinion. She also shows us how these \\"opinions\\" can cause a serious rift between author and editor, even at the prestigious New York Times and London Times.<br /><br />A fun read, and not just for the sticklers among us. But be warned, once you read this you might become one!teacher.  <br /> <br />I also enjoyed Ms. Truss' (sorry, but I'm not adding an \\"s\\" onto the end of her name) ability to give us the various rules, the history behind them, the rationale for their use, and then tell us that, sometimes, there is no right or wrong way; just differences of opinion.

B0006IIPIK|2.0|So much promise, and yet so many, many things that just had me at first whispering \\"No,\\" then shaking my head, then asking all kinds of questions, and finally just wishing for it to be over.  I wanted so badly to dig this film, to really get into it and enjoy it, and by even the mid-point I couldn't help but catalog all of the confusion, contradiction, questions, and junk thrown into and onto this story and film.  It was a significant let-down.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br /><br />- I didn't pay to see it in a theater.<br /><br />- Some very cool general visuals, mainly the backgrounds and panoramic shots of the city, the island, the Shangri-La valley, the robots inside the city, the Union Jack-spangled aerial aircraft carriers, etc.  Beautiful artistic vision.<br /><br />- Neat story, idea, and general sci-fi approach.<br /><br />- Both Law and Jolie had excellent characters to work with, and it looks like they were having fun.<br /><br />On the negative side:<br /><br />- Complete abrogation of the laws of physics.<br /><br />- Dull, washed-out colors, sometimes even looking like bad, early 90s colorization.<br /><br />- New York City doesn't have a massive, snow-capped mountain range within 30 miles of the city.<br /><br />- What exactly is the time frame here, and how have we gotten to a 1940-ish world in which Nazi Germany, expansionist Japan, and World War II have not come to pass?  This is a pretty huge aspect of the story, driving a good part of the action, and would benefit from a modicum of explanation.<br /><br />- How come the good ol' USA is allowing a major privately operated global mercenary force (the Sky Captain's private little group) to occupy space and conduct military major military acquisition, training, and operations within its borders?<br /><br />- Where were the armed forces of the USA in all of this action, especially the attack on NYC?<br /><br />- If Sky Captain runs a global mercenary force, who are they fighting for, and for what goals/objectives?<br /><br />- The street confusion/panic during the robot attack on the city was screamingly inadequate.<br /><br />- How can a 1940s vintage fighter aircraft power-dive a good 10,000 feet and smash into the ocean and not be obliterated into tiny little chips of metal and paint, yet go shooting through the ocean completely unaffected?<br /><br />- How is it the bullets of the robot aircraft stitch-up Law's fighter, but he still flies the living hell out of it, dives it into the ocean, flies it up and out of the ocean, and home?<br /><br />- How come only the Sky Captain's plane managed to get off the ground in the robot attack?  Doesn't he train his people?<br /><br />- How do our heroes manage to outrun an explosion of a few dozen tons of dynamite inside the contained space of an abandoned uranium mine, and then manage to suffer no contamination effects?<br /><br />- What exactly is the doomsday device that is going to incinerate the world, and how is it tied to the rocket ship?<br /><br />- How schmaltzy is it that they had to let all of the animals in the rocket ship loose?  What kind of humans in 1940 had even the slightest inkling of the concept of conservation?<br /><br />- Gwyneth Paltrow may have won an Oscar, but in this movie, describing her performance as \\"wooden,\\" \\"hollow,\\" \\"monotonic,\\" or even \\"flat\\" would be very high praise indeed.<br /><br />- Ribisi came off like a sycophantic little nerd.<br /><br />- If one of the kidnapped scientists was so hot that he could build miniature elephants in his home lab, how is it none of that technology ever got out to the larger world?  This is essentially a very lame \\"Spy Kids 2\\" leftover.<br /><br />- What in the world do the manufactured dinosaurs on Totenkopf's island have to do with anything in the film?<br /><br />- In the ultimate, gag-inducing plot device, Ribisi has already stolen an anti-gravity barge of some sort, and everyone just escapes, shooting maybe 60mph down a tunnel for a good minute.  Then Sky Captain goes back on his suicide mission as the barge zaps down the tunnel some more, maybe a total of about 2 miles away from where they started.  And yet, only 40 seconds later, there's Paltrow saving Law's butt on the big, scary catwalk.  That would mean that Paltrow could run somewhere around 180mph-wow!<br /><br />- Okay, Ribisi and the liberated scientists are two-odd miles away straight down the escape tunnel, and they find Totenkopf's lab, with the windows looking right out into the rocket bay, from which they just escaped.  Uh, slight bending of logic here.<br /><br />- Law and Paltrow blow the bottom of the rocket out to let all the animals loose, and the rocket is essentially empty-so where is the fricking fuel to power the thing?<br /><br />- Once they empty out the rocket, why don't the atmospheric and aerodynamic forces of a rocket traveling at escape velocity over 50,000 meters in the air rip the rocket to shreds?<br /><br />- First there's only one aerial aircraft carrier, and it's hinted that the existence of it is a major secret, but at the end of the film there must be about a dozen of them in the sky, having arrived at the Totenkopf island in the space of what, maybe about 2-3 hours?  Weak.<br /><br />- Jolie's prop-driven aerial aircraft carrier takes a direct hit to one of the four main engines, yet an hour later for the big finale, it's all fixed up and working just fine.<br /><br />- What exactly was in the oh-so-important vials which were needed so badly?<br /><br />In conclusion, rent it for the pretty pictures, and for a cutting-edge example of the future of digital filmmaking and effects.  But don't expect logic, continuity, or coherence.  It's sci-fi, sure, but this sci-fi effort sadly throws out physics, time, and space in order to fit its poorly constructed, device-dependent story.tal of about 2 miles away from where they started.

B00005JLF5|5.0|DS9 broght to the screen a concept  whic had been unfimiliar in the Star Trek realm until then - a series about the lives of people on a space station, rather than on a space ship.<br /><br />After the original Star trek 7 & Star trek TNG, the concept of a space station may have sounded boring. But as it turned out, Deep Space 9 was the most interesting one for one major reason: since the characters were stuck on a stationary space station instead of a space ship that could zoom about the quadrant, we got better & deeper characters, a better look at their interactions, a better look & understanding of new or rarely handled races, but mostly - a much bigger picture of the politics of the era.
B000001FQQ|3.0|HITS is one of the better non makeup Kiss albums. With 15 tracks total, there was bound to be a little filler, so I can deal with the occasional clinker. HITS comes off as an album of Demos and unfinished songs, it is what it is, and at times its very good. Its not nearly as wimpy as some of the other 80's releases, and at the time when it came out, was actually a breath of fresh air for Die hard makeup era Kiss fans, as some of the songs where tougher and not just Bon Jovi type knock offs.  <br /> <br />Regarding the songs themselves, they are allover the place, so many different styles, and basiclly non produced, the sound is very raw and unpolished on a lot of tracks, but this is part of the albums charm. \\"Love is Like A SlapIn The Face\\" does not have one drum fill or cymbal hit in the entire song, it could very well be a drum machine or better yet, Gene on the drums as he played in many of his demos anyway. A lot of Gene on guitar as well of the other demo songs included. \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\\" is a good example.  <br /> <br />Hide Your Heart was a Crazy Nights Throwaway. Many bands tried their hand at this one (Molly Hatchet as well as Ace on trouble Walkin), very Bon Jovi-ish. Prsoner of Love is Great! Betrayed & Rise To It are cool Kiss Songs! Silver Spoon has a great hook as well. Forever gave Kiss a much needed BIG HIT! Some very good material here.... <br /> <br />Overall, HITS has a bum rap among Kiss fans, yet its much better than at least 3 of the Non Makeup albums (Personally, I feel its better than Revenge as well), and ranks as one of the FUN Kiss records. People ofter forget that it has one of their biggest if not the biggest hit in \\"Forever\\", which is a very cool song. It was a step in the right direction, following 3 of the wimpiest, weakest albums of their career. They toured with a huge stage show, and brought back some of the classic Kiss tunes in the process. I saw Eric's last concert at MSG in 11/90 as well.  <br /> <br />I havegreat memories of this album, this is when I Finally accepted Kiss without the makeup, because the music is GOOD!
0792833260|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I was 14 and would've loved any film Tom Cruise was in, regardless of its quality.<br /><br />Looking bakc at this movie, it's hard not to look down on it as 'kitch'- after viewing so many other movies that had used the same techniques to squeeze some more emotions from the audience.<br /><br />Once all that 'background noise' is out of the way, this movie i's pretty good. It has a great cast - Dustin Hoffman deserved an oscar for his performance, while Tom Cruise (even at such an early stage of hisw career) &iacute;s a pretty good actor, too. And once we ignore the cliched 'a road trip is a metaphore for emotional journey' and 'at first I wanted the money, now I want my brother', the message is nicely laid out.<br /><br />There are no special features on this DVD, even though some (including a commentary) would've been nice.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I am glad and relieved to see that there are more than a few people who can see through the lies of the Church and Mel Gibson and his right-wing, neo-conservative religious cronies who would have the masses believe that believing in Jesus is the only way. The truth is that Jesus' name has been used by Christians to extort and bribe and convert millions across the globe against their will. Think about it! What better way to get someone to convert to Christianity than to promise them eternal salvation in the after-life if they simply convert to Christianity and accept the teachings of the fictional character of Jesus at face value. These impoverished souls in the Third World are being basically bribed to join the Christian cult, and this particular cult thrives off of films like \\"The Passion\\" as propaganda tools in order to achieve their goals. Jesus never existed in a historical sense; he was invented by the powers within the Church in order to promote Christianity. Thus, Christianity used Jesus as a marketing tool in order to convince the masses (most of whom were not well-read at the time). Films like Gibson's promote this type of fiction and perpetrates this desire for conversion of those who don't believe in Jesus. Fortunately, people are starting to wake up (there is an increase in anti-missionary work) and realize that the Church has been brainwashing them and has been using fictional Jesus to promote a conservative right-wing agenda. <br /> <br />
B00006SFLV|5.0|Ever since TV was invented, there were shows about the trials & angst of being a teen ager. What makes 'My So Called Life'so great?<br /><br />Lets start with the performances - which were great, especially considering this was an unknown cast - from everyone - not only the main  characters, but also from the supporting cast, no matter how small their part was.<br /><br />Then there was the writing, that somehow managed to perfrctly describe what being a teenager feels like.<br /><br />Then there were the situations - these weren't kids that were only obsessed about sex, nor were they aliens - they were normal kids, just like most of us, dealing with love & sex, but also with relationships with parents, with old & new friends, with drinking & drugs, driving, learning disabilities, and teen homosexuality and its possible reprecautions. Not only did it deal with the lives of 15 / 16 years old, it also involved the story of the Chase family parents, and of little sister Danielle - so it appealed to many group levels, not only to tenagers in a very narrow age range.<br /><br />The only thing wrong with this set is the lack of special features, which would've helped it be more than just a recording of one of the best ever TV shows.
1594200106|5.0|I started this Novel about 7 in the evening on Friday night and couldn't put it down till i finished it at 5 o clock the next morning. I loved the idea of a cemetary of forgotten books, and i found the characters realistic and the mystery element about Julian intriguing. The end could maybe have been more dramatic, but it sorted out all the loose ends well. Altogether i would recommend this book!
B00005JNPZ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Will Smith was great and there was plenty of laughter coming from the audience.  I laughed throughout the entire movie.  It's a must see movie for those who like comedies.
0679879269|4.0|I read \\"Northern Lights\\" as part of my course ot University, and was hooked, so i immediatly went out and bought the next two. This, in my opinion, is the best of the three books. The bittersweet ending, with the poignancy only a true love can leave behind, the expertise with which Pullman brings all the threads of narrative together, and makes the reader realise that non of his characters are either \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" but are more true to life, and are a bit of both. The imagination, and the suspense is amazing.
B0006J28KU|5.0|One of my favorite moments in cinema from the past decade?<br /><br />Val Kilmer emerges from a shiny L.A. bank with roughly $700,000,000,000 in a sack on his back.  Elliott Goldenthal's \\"Force Marker\\" clicks and bumps and pulses on the soundtrack.  Kilmer's in a grey suit, he's got his shades on, he's grinning, strutting a little, he's roughly eight feet away from being the last man into the getaway car and, oops, he spots a flash of an ambush waiting on the other side of a passing bus.  Boom, in 0.8 seconds he just lets rip with the AK.  And then we're off into a live action \\"Grand Theft Auto\\" inspiration, a truly staggering sequence that absolutely must be seen in widescreen.  Turn it up.<br /><br />Finally we have a decent DVD edition of the best cop movie of the 1990s. One of the great pleasures of moviegoing in this century is to see the way Michael Mann points a camera at city nightscapes, clothing, guns, vehicles, wrist watches, cash, blueprints, helicopters, crime scenes, power tools, telephones, cars and the eyes of men and women doing hard work.  All of that is on display here.<br /><br />I could go on forever about the extas here (praising the cool commentary by Mann, slamming the \\"deleted\\" scenes, sending out minor gripes about non-juiced-up picture and sound) but others have already done that better than I could.  Great movie.

B000025XKM|5.0|Bewitching beauty is the inescapable retreat that is Nick Drake's Pink Moon. Pleasantly melancholic tunes of one gentle voice singing heartfelt lyrics accompanied by the strings of a lone guitar that creates a slowly winding road of peace and serenity around you, total relaxation, and if you truly listen you will get lost in its beauty. <br /> <br />This is an absolutely amazing compilation of brilliance! <br /> <br />\\"Pink Moon\\" Opens with its title track, lightly versed, but accompanied by some incredibly corpulent acoustics with a bit of piano on the side for flavour. \\"I saw it written and I saw it say, Pink moon is on its way, And none of you stand so tall, Pink moon gonna get you all, It's a pink moon, Yeah it's a pink, pink, pink, pink, pink moon\\" Even though the lyrics are somewhat dismal, the strong feelings delivered by the combined voice of Nick and guitar on this one leaves you singing along while possibly playing a bit of air guitar and tapping out a few on the invisible ivories. <br /> <br /> \\"Place to Be\\" (My absolute favourite!) Is enough to melt the heart of the hopeless romantic, but is emotional without getting too weepy, beautifully poetic without becoming pretentious (\\"Now I'm weaker than the palest blue, Oh, so weak in this need for you\\") Sit behind your sweetie, wrap your arms around them, and sing this one softly in their ear. Guaranteed meltdown! <br /> <br />\\"Road\\" Brings on a change in mood here and introduces you to the incredible talent of Nick's playing. Although this tune is lyric'd, I always find my self lost in the manipulation of strings. Incredibly this is one man with one guitar. <br /> <br />\\"Which Will\\" Is cloud soft and rain gentle in accompaniment, melded with introspective questioning lyrics. Beware, this one could be cathartic! <br /> <br />The instrumental \\"Horn\\" is extremely simplistic yet deeply complex, Drake doesn't need words to convey what he's feeling, and the mood comes across loud and clear. <br /> <br />The only way I can describe \\"Things Behind the Sun\\" would be a solemn rainy autumn day with contemplative breaks of sun within the glower. You almost have to wonder if this was the type of day that inspired this song because Drake captures the feeling so expressively. Great tune! <br /> <br />A simplified \\"Know\\" slows things down a bit with an almost painful southern spiritual sound backed by a seven note riff  \\"Know that I love you, Know I don't care, Know that I see you, Know I'm not there\\"  <br />  <br />The naked honesty of this album is at its most tortured on \\"Parasite\\", in which Drake sings one of the most gorgeously miserable, vivid depictions of the sensitive, self-loathing outcast. He plucks his guitar strings mournfully, deliberately, as he sings verses that are almost uncomfortably blunt \\"Changing a rope for a size too small, People all get hung.\\" When he delivers the song's payoff line, it's soul-crushing \\"Take a look you may see me in the dirt, for I am the parasite who hangs from your skirt.\\" <br /> <br />Drake's deft guitar playing shines on \\"Free Ride\\", a song with one of the more memorable pop hooks on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Harvest Breed\\" Is just a nice light little acoustic ditty that seems to clear the mind and begins to bring you back into the light, but the lyrics definitely contradict its melody. The mystifying genius behind this work as a whole. <br /> <br />As Pink Moon closes with the hopeful strains of \\"From the Morning\\", it's like seeing the first rays of sunlight glow on the horizon after the saddest night of your life, as Drake sings, almost optimistically \\"So look see the days, the endless colored ways, and go play the game you learnt, from the morning\\" <br />  <br />Pink Moon is one of the most musically stripped-down and emotionally naked albums I have ever heard. It is about us all, one of those rare works that truly speaks something to everyone. <br />
0440180295|5.0|One of the great aspects of Slaughterhouse Five is its ability to challenge the reader's idea of reality and various social norms, namely war.  Billy Pilgrim, the main character of the novel, is born in Illium, New York.  At a young age, Billy enlists to fight for America in World War II and claims witness to one of the biggest blunders of World War II, the bombing of Dresden, Germany.  After Billy gets out of Germany and the war alive, he claims to have been abducted by an alien race called the Tralfamidorians, a species far more advanced than the human race.  As he shares his outrageous experiences and the ideology of the Tralfamadorian race with the reader and other characters of the novel, his credibility and sanity soon become skeptical, landing him in a mental institution.  While the character of Billy Pilgrim is simply an intermediary through which Kurt Vonnegut displays his ideas, the reader can not help but wonder if Billy and his beliefs are valid, or a figment of the imagination.  Even if you do not enjoy anti-war or science fiction novels, this book will bring the reader far more than what is expected opening up a world of new ideas and endless possibilities.

B0007O38F8|4.0|...do not start dissin 50's album because of the beef he has with The Game. It's not that serious. Yes, we all know that 50 Cent is a cocky person who seems to have a deathwish. But, then again, so are Eminem, 2Pac, Biggie, and pretty much every other rapper out there. They ALL like flaunting what they have. What rapper doesn't prophesize their own death in at least ONE song? <br /> <br />Anyway, I like 50's album better than the Game. In all honest truth, I really don't like the Game. I've always been a fan of 50 Cent and I won't ever stop being one. No, this album is not better than Get Rich or Die Tryin, but it isn't completely horrible, either. This is a really good cd. I've heard both 50 and the Game's cds, and I think they are on the same level of each other. Even though I don't like the Game, he still has some hot songs, just like 50. So, don't dis this cd because of their beef outside of music. It'a really all about the music. <br /> <br />So, stay focused on the reviewing of the MUSIC, not 50's beef with other people. I recommend this cd to anyone because the beats are hot and so are the collabos (especially the two with Olivia).

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Finally,  (after seeing the stage production) the movie gives me the beginning, middle and ending.  I loved it.  I thought the Phantom being younger added so much to the story.  Emmy Rossen, Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson were exactly the right choices in my opinion.  The beginning was great when the chandelier brought the old opera house alive again.  The music, acting, and the story became so real to me I actually cried when Christine showed him compassion in spite of all the evil things he had done.  I came away thinking how being cruel to someone can make that person scared, sad and ultimately cruel beyond the point of no return, except through forgiveness from God.  It was truly awesome, soul searching and it truly made my heart sing.  Thank you to all who brought it to us via the movie theatre.<br /><br />For all the criticism I've read of Gerard Butler in the role of the Phantom - I would submit that he made the Phantom real and compelling.  When I saw Michael Crawford in the stage production I thought he was her father or at the very least a father figure.  Gerard Butler brought emotion and you could feel the intense attraction that he felt for Christine and she felt for him.  I really believed if he hadn't become obsessed to the point of killing people - she could have really loved him.  But alas, that's what makes the story so compelling.  Raoul was her first love and her heart ended up where it belonged - with him.  I never had the feeling during the stage production (which I saw 2 times) that she might never have forgotten the Phantom.  I did have that feeling in the movie, which I saw 3 times and pre-ordered the DVD.  Also purchased the musical sound track.<br /><br />I think sometimes the critics look too much for perfection - when what most of us really feel are the emotions of real life and our imperfections.  I think all the actors were amazing and did an awesome job with very difficult and demanding roles.<br /><br />It was so refreshing to see some new faces and talent that I'm sure we'll be hearing alot more about in the future.  Kudos to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher.t that I'm sure we'll be hearing alot more about in the future.  Kudos to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|Like most people reviewing this release, I was looking forward to hearing what Judas Priest would sound like with Rob Halford resuming vocal duties.  While it's great to have him back in the fold, the album leaves a bit to be desired.<br /><br />The album opens with a song that could easily have come from Painkiller.  Rob is definitely in fine form here and the band sounds tight.  The song definitely rocks and for me the best line appears when he sings(roars?), \\"Judas is Rising!\\"  Yes, Judas Priest is back.<br /><br />The next two songs, \\"Deal with the Devil\\" and \\"Revolution\\" are run-of-the-mill JP rockers; lots of chugging power chords with little to make the songs interesting.<br /><br />The fourth song, \\"Worth Fighting For\\", is a nice change of pace with Rob actually singing and not screaming (which certainly has its place), but this is a nice diversion.  Again, no new ground is covered, but this song works nicely.<br /><br />The following song follows a trend that goes back to their very first album where the title refers to a person or thing and ends in \\"-er\\".  \\"Cheater\\", \\"Dreamer Deceiver\\", \\"Sinner\\", \\"Exciter\\", \\"Invader\\", \\"Grinder\\"... you get the idea.  Well, this album includes the imaginative song title, \\"Demonizer\\", another metal-by-numbers tune that doesn't make much of an impression.<br /><br />When I read the title of the next song, \\"Wheels of Fire\\", all I can think of is the Painkiller album cover.  Sadly, this song contains the all-too-clich&eacute;d line \\"Ride to Live, Live to Ride\\".  Can you say \\"Wheels of Cheese\\"?  I thought so.  Next...<br /><br />\\"Angel\\" is an interesting song in that it uses mostly acoustic guitar.  If my memory serves me, it's been a long time since they've used acoustic guitar and it sounds good here.  Nice singing, mellow, and builds nicely.<br /><br />Next up... Oh, boy, another -er song!  This one is titled \\"Hellrider\\".  I'm channeling the Painkiller album cover again.  OK song, nothing special.<br /><br />\\"Eulogy\\" starts off nicely enough, until the lyrics kick in.  As others have mentioned the lyrics on the album can be a bit cheesy side and these are no exception.  Keyboards can be heard throughout the song, but you have to wonder why they brought in an outsider to play them.  Glenn Tipton certainly could have played the lines without any trouble.<br /><br />\\"Lock Ness\\".  Why, oh, why?  What were they thinking and why did they record this mess?  What you get here are 13+ minutes of droning boredom with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  They could have omitted this song and included two decent songs instead.  If they ever do this one on tour, I'm heading for the bathroom.<br /><br />Thumbs down:<br />1.  The double-kick drum thing has been done to death.  Yes, Scott, we know you know how to use it, now give it a rest.  It's not always about what you play, sometimes it about what you DON'T play...<br />2.  The guitar tone sounds way too processed on a number of songs.<br />3.  An over-abundance of some really juvenile lyrics.  Painkiller suffered the same fate, this release doesn't improve the situation much.<br />4.  The DVD was LAME!  The \\"Documentary\\", such as it was, was 40 minutes long.  No problems there, but too much of the interview footage was interspersed with performances from a show in Europe (Spain? Italy?), but they don't show the entire performance.  Of the songs that are shown, you see anywhere from 50-75% of each song.  This is fine, but the  kicker is that when you play the chapter showing their concert performances, you see the EXACT same perfomance shown during the \\"Documentary\\".  It would have been fine had it been a different show or different songs from the same show, but the same material?  What a joke.  As it turns out, there is too little documentary and WAY too much duplicated concert performance.  This was a BIG disappointment.  The interviews, while amusing, weren't terribly revealing.<br /><br />Thumbs up:<br />1.  The band sounds very energetic and inspired and it's nice to see them together again.<br />2.  Nice mix of mellow songs played with acoustic guitar.  It's nice to see them breaking out of the mold and trying some new stuff.  They should continue to expand the boundaries of what is expected of them and continue in this vein (e.g., more variety in song styles, acoustic guitar, keyboards, etc.)  It would also be nice to have Ian Hill toss in a song or two.<br />3.  Great vocal work from Halford.  His voice still sounds great after all these years and is used creatively on a number of songs.<br /><br />Hopefully, this is the first of many future releases from a re-invigorated band.nice to see them breaking out of the mold and trying some new stuff.

6305079811|3.0|For those who haven't seen this movie, read any of the other reviews.  It's a great movie, with terrific sets, sound, everything.  The problem I've got with it is that this DVD was very poorly produced.  Queen's soundtrack sounds like it's coming out of a cell phone speaker, and with all the opportunity they have to put extras on the disc, the studio did very little.  I'll happily go buy the SuperBit/Criterion version if it's ever made, just to enjoy the soundtrack the way it was meant to me heard.

No details on what the extras are yet, but it's about time this hysterical flick gets some SE treatment! So, if you don't own this already (or even if you do), wait until August and we'll all be able to see this movie with the Flair it deserves instead of the no-frills version currently available.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Having seen the stage production twice and the movie 3 times I say you can't compare the two.   Both were brilliant in their own way --  <br /> <br />But the cast of the movie was exceptional.  Gerard Butler - brought the Phantom to life.  Emmy Rossum was totally believable as Christine.  Raoul, Mdm. Giry, Meg were well played.   <br /> <br />One small quibble - the Masquerade scene.... why such dreadful costuming and dancing?  The stage production was astounding as the cast danced down the staircase in brilliant color. <br /> <br />Go see it!  The critics are useless. <br /> <br />
B00005LQ04|5.0|I can't believe that I'm almost done working my way through Dario Argento's filmography! It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere in any format let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated versions. Unfortunately most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. Out of all of his masterpieces--\\"Deep Red,\\" \\"The Bird With the Crystal Plumage,\\" and \\"Tenebre\\" among them--the one that stands head and shoulders above all others is \\"Suspiria.\\" I recently sat down to watch this after a long period of anticipation. Everything you've seen and heard about it is true; this is Argento's epic masterwork.<br /><br />It doesn't start out that way, though. American Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) is a gifted ballerina arriving in Europe to attend a rather elite German dance academy in Freiburg. The opening sequences of the film find young Suzy arriving at the airport, hailing a taxi, and heading out to the school in the pouring rain. \\"O.K.,\\" you say to yourself, \\"I've seen horror films open with similar sequences before.\\" And you're right--you have seen movies begin in such a mundane way. Then Argento throws out one of his massively disturbing murder scenes, i.e. a young girl from the academy perishes when a knife plunges into her heart. Again, no big deal, right? Wrong. If you've seen a couple of Argento films you know full well how he displays onscreen carnage. It goes on and on in gooey close-up, and the same happens here. The stabbing is so gruesome that even this extremely jaded horror fan cringed repeatedly. I cringe now just recalling the sequence. The killing is a rather inauspicious incident marking the arrival of Suzy, especially since the young ballerina happened to witness a few clues that explain what occurred. Of course, she doesn't know that yet. Nor do we. Argento will remind us of these clues at the horrific denouement.<br /><br />And what a denouement! Stylish, haunting, colorful, and deeply frightening; these are the hallmarks of \\"Suspiria,\\" not only in the conclusion to the film but also in the lead up as well. Everything is weird at this academy, slightly askew in an ominous and vague way. Suzy's fellow students seem oddly aloof, the instructors possess a shrill and vicious temperament that occasionally breaks through their carefully constructed facade, and the building itself oozes menace. Strange noises permeate the floors of the building, footsteps are heard shuffling about late at night, and Suzy soon begins to feel ill. What's going on? Well, it's got something to do with the sort of women we normally associate with pointy hats and broomsticks. Yep, you heard correctly: Suzy Bannion walked into a building housing a coven of witches. These are powerful women with an ancient past and a horrific record of murder and mayhem. Suzy's investigations into the bizarre events at the academy will soon find her face to face with these malefic old biddies in a series of hidden rooms that positively reek of evil. Will Bannion triumph over the witches? One thing is for sure--one must be careful with creatures that can kill with the wave of a hand.<br /><br />I could literally provide a scene by scene breakdown of this film without revealing any significant spoilers because \\"Suspiria\\" whizzes by in an anarchic way that defies logical description. It's all about style, really, as Argento beefs up the color schemes to frenzied levels. He also imbues the film with his trademark violence, violence that sees a man's throat torn to shreds, a heart repeatedly perforated with a very sharp knife, and a cruel scene involving a room of barbed wire that one must see to believe. Most importantly, Goblin provides yet another immensely haunting score--an eclectic mix of strings, drums, and disturbing voices--that increases exponentially the sense of impending doom the viewer feels as he or she watches the proceedings. \\"Suspiria\\" even manages to cast veteran actor Udo Kier in the role of a psychiatrist who knows quite a bit of disturbing information about the dance academy. \\"Suspiria\\" is Argento's first and best entry in his venerated \\"Three Mothers\\" trilogy (the third installment has yet to appear), and it's far, far better than its follow-up \\"Inferno,\\" an even more confusing film than this one. Without a doubt, all of Argento's trademark techniques find perfect expression in this tour de force.<br /><br />A big movie requires a big DVD, and you can pick up a three disc \\"Suspiria\\" set that gives us the film in all its colorful glory. We also get a lengthy documentary about the making of the film, production notes, trailers, an entire disc devoted to Goblin's chilly soundtrack, and plenty of other goodies to whittle away the hours. I read recently that someone plans on remaking this film, apparently in an attempt to cash in on audiences willing to see updated versions of Hooper's \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\\" \\"The Exorcist,\\" and several other genre staples. I can't imagine anyone creating a better version of Argento's classic film; it's a movie in a league all its own and should stay that way.els.

B0006Z2LH4|5.0|This is the best of the 3 movies by far, it gives you all the information that you wanted to know from the first two movies.  You finally find out why they have been placed into the cube, and it shows some of the people that are controlling it.

I don't need to tell you about the other 7/10 DVD's in the box  - heck, you may even own some of them. So what. Go red.<br />The brothers have created two completely new commentary tracks for all three movies, this alone is worth the price to the package: The first with two philosophers who liked the movie (and 1 of the 2 was in the movie) and the second soundtrack with three critics who hated the movie. Whiz bang - so much fun  - hit me. Listen and learn: Each sound track is as good as the original movie: thank dog for capitalism or you would be eating your great grandmother's pudding and cranking a 78 rpm phono. <br />The more life changes the more you realize what stays the same - and then you like change because everything is so predictable. <br />Add to the list that includes Lawyers and Politicians  - the Movie Critic: On this DVD you will listen to the parasites use Catapillar Back Hoes to shovel mounds of buffalo cookies to new heights. Funny how after they yap for 30 minutes and then suddenly exclaim &quot;I didn't really understand that scene&quot; - over and over. There is a reason why won't wear your father's tie; feel good about it.<br />SPECS: The new digital transfer is extraordinary. This is perhaps the most beautiful movie I have ever watched on my fity inch.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Yes, they have returned with the Best Heavy Metal Sound YET!!!!! <br />I come from the old school of Heavy Metal of the 1980's. <br />Judas Priest have never sounded better!!! \\"ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION\\" <br />I have been playing the new cd non stop... To me, sounds alittle like \\"Ram It Down\\", and \\"Demolition\\". And not to for get, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and one of my all time Best \\"Turbo\\". Songs like \\"Worth Fighting For\\". Puts a chill down my spine, and \\"Angel\\", Rob Halford always did have a softer side of his Fabulous Voice. And best of all, Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing, both on lead and rythum guitars, These guys know how to play a guitar. The sound they make on this cd, is so \\"Awesome\\". <br />They should be place in the Top 5 guitar players of Heavy Metal. <br />I am so glad Rob Halford got back together with Judas Priest. This cd was worth the waiting for. The 1st song on the cd, \\"Judas Rising\\" tells it all. And \\"Eulogy\\", is so great. What I like about this cd, it sounds like old Classic Judas Priest, with alittle new twist of different types of sounds, like he used keyboards and piano on \\"Angel\\". And like \\"Revolution\\",and \\"HellRider\\" sounds differnet in some ways. I have no doubt, The sound of the new Judas Priest \\"Angel Of Retribution\\", no new band today, can come close to this group. The true sound of \\"Heavy Metal\\" comes  <br />\\"Alive\\" on this cd. Buy this cd today, It will be playing on your cd player for a long time.  <br /> <br />One of your greast fans, <br />Ever, <br /> <br />P. Scimemi <br />Lake Charles, La.
B000002KCI|5.0|When I was in college in the mid-1970's I owned a vinyl copy of 'Zuma'.  Back then it was a disc that I skipped around a bit on, mainly to avoid the longer, darker tracks, 'Danger Bird' and 'Cortez the Killer'.  Neil never gave up on 'Cortez...' however, and so the song has grown on me.  'Danger Bird' is still too depressing, although lyrics such as \\"and we use to be so calm, now I think about you all day long, 'cause you've been with another man, there you are and here I am (that's the moment that he cracked, long ago in the museum with his friends)\\" certainly cannot be forgotten nor dismissed.  If you're looking to wallow in misery, Neil almost always includes a wallowing track on all his discs, and 'Danger Bird' answers the call here. <br /> <br />The remainder of the disc is replete with winners, some dark, some hopeful.  The album opens with 'Don't Cry No Tears', a rationalized defense (\\"but there's nothing I can say, to make him go away, old true love ain't too hard to see, don't cry no tears around me\\") against emotional pain set to a splendid country-rock melody.  'Pardon My Heart', in contrast, investigates rather than exercising our emotional defense mechanisms (\\"it's a sad communication, with little reason to believe, when one isn't giving, and one pretends to receive...\\") and interpersonal avoidance.  The tender, soft melody creates an atmosphere of sincere reflection and openness. <br /> <br />Aside from the closer, the remaining songs kick up plenty of dust.  'Lookin' For a Love' is another country-rock number, this one generally optimistic about finding a new love and wanting \\"to live and make the best of what I see\\".  'Barstool Blues' recounts an encounter with a lost love in a bar with great regrets.  The line \\"I have seen you in the movies and those magazines at night\\" would seem to suggest Neil is singing about his first wife, actress Carrie Snodgress.  It's got a great electric guitar riff and chorus (\\"burn off all the fog and let the sun throughto the snow, let me see your face again before I have to go\\"), but to really get an idea where Neil was going with this one, check out the live version on 1996's 'Year of the Horse' live disc, which really kicks. <br /> <br />'Drive Back' is, in retrospect, perhaps the most interesting cut on the album, as it presages Young's use of squelching feedback on tracks such as 'Fountainbleu' (from 'Long May You Run') and 'Hey Hey My My' (from 'Rust Never Sleeps').  It's either an indictment or celebration of the power of emotional withdrawl, depending on how you interpret lyrics such as the chorus \\"drive back to your old town, I wanna wake up with no one around\\" and \\"you won't know me, I won't call you, I won't be there, to remind you\\".  A frighteningly powerful guitar riff frames this schema of rejection. <br /> <br />The closer is a rather odd inclusion of a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young song, the atmospheric 'Through My Sails', exploring a smorgasbord of feelings (\\"into paradise I soared\\", \\"total confusion, disillusion\\", \\"it feels like I'm gone\\", \\" but love takes care\\").  Just before recording 'Zuma', Young had agreed to tour with Crosby, Stills and Nash, but a hoped-for reunion album never materialized.  Given what Stephen and Crosby and Nash were working on at the time (the album 'Stills' with 'Turn Back the Pages', and Crosby and Nash's 'Wind On the Water'), it's compelling to think what the quartet could have put together.  'Through My Sails' is perhaps just a taste, along with 'As I Come of Age' from Stephen's 'Stills' album. <br /> <br />The cover of 'Zuma' offers a sketch from Young, illustrating what would seem to be a combination of impressions from 'Danger Bird' and 'Cortez the Killer'.  'Zuma' may also be the first album cover to feature an upraised middle finger, this one just barely veiled as a cactus.  Lyrics are included, which is a welcome bonus with any CD. 'Zuma' is a central componant of any comprehensive Neil Young collection, and a worthy additionto any collection of what was best in 1970's rock and roll.  Don't rest until you have this one!
B0006U4UAU|5.0|lcd ss makes genius references, while still keeping this album completely innovative.  some people won't get it, but that's okay.  <br />if you like bowie, eno, t rex, the fall, siouxsie, and disco disco disco, then you'll get this. i love that the first disc spans several different genres; i think most people were expecting only a dance record. i think james murphy has proven himself with this. it's an important record.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|im not going to try and sound super sophisticated because ill be frank, im not.  after watching this movie i was motivated to create an amazon account for the one intention of reviewing it.  this movie came to me highly reccomended by a friend.  this friend had mentioned that this was the only movie that had made her cry.  i thought it cant be that bad...then i watched it for the first time.  i started watching and nothing seemed too special the main character harry taking his mothers tv with his friend tyrone, getting high, having a good time  then the characters started to develop i started to see how lonely, desperate, kind, and caring sara was.  i started to see the heirarchy of her friends and everything develop...now my reviews going to take a change...i dont want to summarize the plot of the movie and what happened but rather the emotional bombardment that i underwent.  after the first view i was more angry at marion ( sorry i didnt mention her before, harry's g/f), harry, and tyrone because they knew the effects addiction could have and still pursued it, however i was touched by what had happened to sara.  i was also shocked and a little suprised by some of the sexual content.  however on the second viewing everything changed.  sexual content became an unreplacable element to the storytelling showing how truly desperate a human can be.  also everytime a character would shoot heroine a peice of me would die.  while watching this movie i was able to pinpoint the last truly happy moment in the movie which was about 30-40 minutes into it, one could also chart the downfall of each character, you could plot it on a graph and watch the slope plummit into hell, it is impossible to put the immotional impact of this film into words...i just have to add the climax about the last 20 minutes of the movie will make your life outlook so dismal you will have to look at everything in a new light, if you want to be truly moved by an overwhelmingly brutal exhibition of humanity at its worst this movie is it, the movie itself is intoxicating after one view i put it down and said i would never watch it again, 3 days later i watched it again it is so well directed, im rambling now and i cant put whats left to say about this film into words so this will have to do, IT IS LIFE CHANGING
B0007O38F8|2.0|First, I am not a big fan of 50 Cent or G-Unit.  Personally, I think he does not have the lyrical content that other artists have.  He makes a lot of dance music in my opinion. <br /> <br />His second album \\"The Massacre\\" is what it is.  50 Cent still lacks the lyrical content that other MCs have.  Also, his rhymes just do not flow like other MCs.  This album to me is more like Pop Rap/Clubbin' music than anything. <br /> <br />The disses on Nas, Jadakiss, and Fat Joe from \\"Piggy Bank\\" were wack.  When you wanna battle/diss someone, say something meaningful or funny.  It was neither of those things.  And when you take on someone whose lyrical content is miles above yours (Nas and Jada's rhymes), you gotta bring it. <br /> <br />I liked \\"Gattman and Robbin\\" mainly for Em's verse. <br /> <br />I liked the \\"Hate it or love it\\" Remix because of everyone else's verses except 50.  When I first heard the beginning, the beat was the same and 50s lyrics were the same.  I thought I have this freakin song on the Game's album, but then the Game dropped a different verse and other G-unit members dropped verses too.  Thank God. <br /> <br />Every other song is very mediocre.  There are some catchy beats, but not enough to save or avoid the massacre. <br /> <br />If you like pop rap/hip hop clubbin music and this album is perfect for you.  If you want lyrical content and real hip hop, I suggest you look elsewhere. <br /> <br />I gave this 2 stars because it is catchy hip hop clubbin music so it should appeal to some people. <br /> <br />

B0002KVUKM|2.0|And there were lots of them. Dracula walking on walls was a good one, as were the transformations and the CG harpies.<br /><br />I think the women's costumes count as special effects, too. Anna's exaggerated hour-glass figure says a lot about Kate Beckinsale's ability to endure a corset. Also, her blouse managed to cover her quite properly and still convey the idea of not being there - that was pretty special. I think some strategically placed pink pectoral patches enhanced that illusion. Those brides of Dracula had some very special effects in their bodices as well. (BTW, after seeing where the spawn of Dracula comes from, I really don't want to know much about their home life.)<br /><br />Plot? I guess there might have been one. Sort of. The lead character, Van Helsing, goes around shooting bad guys with a sort of crossbow/Gatling gun kind of thing. I suppose I could say more, but it still wouldn't add up to real story line.<br /><br />It's an exciting movie in a bland sort of way. You could do worse - but you might have to try.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002UA0|5.0|Miles away from most anything they did later on, Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn is a delightful slice of late 60's British psychedelia. Sometimes fun and playful, at times sinister and frightening. I  still listen to this one all the way through ( something I can't manage with many other Floyd albums, especially the last two, post-Waters, studio albums Division Bell and Momentary Lapse of Reason). An incredible, lasting debut. If all you know of the Floyd is their big-sellers like the Wall and Dark Side of the Moon, I would approach this one with a very open mind, as it is NOTHING like the harder, more traditional \\"rock\\" sound. Roughly half of this is twisted, psychedelic pop, the other half experimental, instrumental, spacey jams. The very best I can say is that there is literally no touchstone here, nothing it can be compared to. It is a world all its own.
B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory is one of the best industrial/aggro/metal bands out there. This CD proves it. I cannot stop listening to \\"Replica\\", the best track on this CD. When I downloaded that song, this introduced me to Fear Factory and how great of a band they are. These guys know how to make the most brutal industrial metal out there. You will not regret buying this. Other great tracks are \\"Zero Signal\\" and \\"New Breed\\". Fear Factory kicks ass and you know it.

B000002P2W|5.0|The Who By Numbers (1975.), the Who's seventh studio album<br /><br />The Who By Numbers is definitely up there with the Who's top efforts. This is by no means a hard rock album but it still achieves in transmitting music of great energy, passion and imagination. With this album, we see the Who return to a singer-songwriter effort, having 2 years earlier put out the remarkable and successful 'Quadrophenia' rock opera and my do they do it well. Townshend certainly proves why he is one of the great songwriters with this album and just shows how well he can move from concept album to an album of separate songs. The Who had been producing albums for 10 years by this stage and certainly show no signs of dropping in standard with this album.<br /><br />So what is 'The Who By Numbers' all about? The answer to this is both simple and complex. The simple way to put it is that with this album we see the music move onto a theme of 'mid-life crisis' as opposed to the 'teenage wasteland/lifehouse' themes of previous discs. However, within this crisis theme are plenty of complex issues which were certainly annoying and depressing Townshend (in particular) at the time - you can see Townshend spilling his guts with his songwriting just by some of the song titles (i.e. 'However Much I Booze' and 'How Many Friends'). I don't personally have a problem with these themes (some people who have listened to the Who dislike this songwriting direction which Townshend took, for some reason) and they certainly work well with the Who style (they had a similar if slightly lesser success with this in their follow up 'Who Are You'). There is no repetitiveness on this album, each track gives you something different. The current available CD edition is also good from the point of view of the extras it gives you on top of the original 10 tracks on the album. Included at the end are 3 excellent live tracks which they performed at Swansea Football Ground in June 1976 - they do a fantastic version of 'Behind Blue Eyes' here. The album also has a great cover showing the band as 'joining the dots' characters. John Entwhistle was working on his cartoon history of the Who at the time and this was one of his drawings - a great idea for a front cover.<br /><br />So onto the tracks on the album themselves. The whole thing starts off in a great rocking fashion with 'Slip Kid' and is followed up 'However Much I Booze' a track with a catchy riff and some powerful lyrics. 'Squeeze Box' is one of the more amusing tracks and also one of the more commercial efforts on the album. 'Dreaming from the Waste' and 'Imagine a Man' are both typical Townshend songs which are very effective with the lyrics they give. 'Success Story' by John Entwhistle and 'They are all in Love' a slower effort are both worth a good listen. 'Blue Red and Grey' follows these, its probably my least favourite track on the album but it is still an intersting acoustic effort with a brass band sound incorporated in the later stages. 'How Many Friends' is a fantastic track and certainly one of my favourite songs by the Who and perhaps one of their most underrated tracks. For me it epitomises the Who's music, with a great guitar sound in the background - for me it is the strongest effort on the album. 'In a Hand of a Face' makes a good finish.<br /><br />So certainly this is another great effort by the Who. With this 1975 they again showed listeners that they never needed to hide behind their mask of concept albums as this work contains some excellent songs which make it worthy of 5*'s anyday. It may need a few listens for the work to start to appeal but that in no way detracts the album's overall standing. This is ceratinly the kind of Who album to get after listening to works such as 'Who's Next' and 'Tommy'.here. The album also has a great cover showing the band as 'joining the dots' characters.

I'm suppose to die tonight is my favourite.... take a listen... its a good album... it will definitely grow on you..
B00005JM0B|1.0|Following the advice of a co-worker, I decided to finally rent \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\". I was kind of avoiding it, because Schwarzenegger once said that he would only do T3 if James Cameron were involved.<br /><br />Well, Cameron must've transmogrified into the giant dump truck of money driven up to Arnold's place.<br /><br />Where do I start with just how awful this movie was... wooden acting, revisionist continuity almost on par with \\"Highlander 2: The Quickening\\", no sense of fear or danger, I mean, I think the T-1000 could slap around the T-X just by staring at her. And too many: \\"Hey look, this is a reference to the last two movies!\\" moments.<br /><br />And the ending, oh geez, I won't spoil the oh-so-huge twist ending but was the most anticlimatic piece of dreck I've ever seen. And frankly, I wouldn't trust my life to somebody who killed my future self not too long ago, thank you.<br /><br />I thought this movie was iffy when I first heard about it. And this is a true story: when I went to \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" on opening night some executives from Warner Bros. were in the audience and asked us to do a survey afterwards. One of the questions asked our opinion of the T3 trailer shown beforehand. I let them know exactly what I thought given the limited responses available: \\"It it highly unlikely that I will see this movie.\\" I mean, I just sat down to see a movie where machines have taken over the world and the T3 trailer made Terminator start to look like a Matrix ripoff!<br /><br />I wonder if you can file class actions against state governors who made bad movies to get our money back.<br /><br />Well, I finally watched \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" and I can't unwatch it. Now any future viewings of T1 and T2 have been tainted, thank you so very much mister director-man. Thank you for running a once-respected action franchise into the ground. I won't be back.

0316779237|2.0|I read Sedaris' \\"Dress Your Kids in Curduroy and Denim\\" *I think I got the title right) and found it hilarious. So when I saw this by the same author in the bookstore, I bought it. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.  <br />The first story, \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" is hilarious, though. The best story in the book. I probably liked it so much because it was based on his life, (at least I think so), while the other stoies were unclear and coming from another person's point of view. I guess I like Sedaris' writing because he turns his own experiences that seem so ordinary and well, sometimes odd experiences, into such hilarious stories. So when I read this, I was expecting to read another compilation of funny stories like those he wrote about in \\"Dress Your ...\\" But I guess not. If you want to read the \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" I suggest you buy the other book that has it nd not spend the money for four other stories that aren't his best.

Just a Lil Bit - Good beat, not feeling 50's flow, hook is weak and annoying - 2/5 <br /> <br />15. Gunz Come Out - Great beat, 50 comes good, hook is good - 4.5/5 <br /> <br />16. My Toy Soldier (Featuring Tony Yayo) - Good beat, 50 spits real fast and hard, Yayo's verse is a little above average...nothing spectacular, hook is real hard - 4.5/5 <br /> <br />17. Position of Power - Good beat, 50 comes pretty nice, not really feeling the hook - 4/5 <br /> <br />18. Build You Up (Featuring Jamie Foxx) - Good beat, 50 spits pretty well, Jamie comes pretty good on the hook as well..not my type of song though - 3.5/5 <br /> <br />19.

I Don't Need `Em - Good beat, 50 comes pretty good, hook is weak - 3.5/5 <br /> <br />22. Hate It or Love It [G-Unit Remix] (Featuring The Game, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, & Lloyd Banks) - Finally the first (and probably the only track) with all 5 G-Unit members, Good beat, each of them come good, hook is good - 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Overall: 83.5 /105 <br /> <br />4 Stars <br /> <br />This album isn't as bad as people say it is but it didn't meet my expectations. 50 may be the leader in G-Unit but he definitely isn't the best. Don't get me wrong, the album is hot but would have been way better if it had more productions by Dr. Dre and Eminem. <br />
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah is just amazing in this album!  She has amazanly strong vocals, and amazing song writing.  There is not one track on here I don't like.  It is really one of those CDs that you can listen to all the way through.   <br /> <br />Truly a work of genius, and HIGHLY recommended!!
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I didn't think that it was too bad, except for the Russians. When a Mexican or Spaniard appears in a film, they hire a Mexican or Spaniard. When a German appears in a film, they hire a German. When Russians appear, they hire some bums off the streets and have them speak with horrible accents. Honestly, in Washington state last year 55% of the new immigrants were Russian or Ukrainian. New York gets tens of thousands of Russian immigrants per year. They can find some real frickin' Russians. <br /> <br />The one main Russian character wasn't too bad until the end. He started mispronouncing words. Simple words like 'car'. They even had Bourne refer to a woman as a man!! He asked her if she understood, but he asked it as if he was addressing a man (Russian conjugates past tense verbs according to the gender of the subject). Those were only the glaring oddities. Other misuses of a beautiful language were only minor, but enough to take me completely out of the film.

B00000IMTH|5.0|This is is a absolutely brilliant album that now would be called power metal or classic metal, but back in the day was just called metal or hard rock.    I played this many, many times back in 1985-86, and I think it is a phenomenol album throughout, consistently great in every song.  Rainbow Rising seems to be regarded nowadays by many people and fans as the best and most famous Rainbow album, and a lot of people foolishly and wrongly disregard this one.  In fact it is very hard to even find a cd copy, and I don't have one.  Some second hand shops have 12 inch LP versions.    Long Live Rock and Roll itself is a fantastic power anthem about rock and roll.  True, the lyrics aren't very deep, but it really rocks.  Fantastic tune.  My favorite song ever about rock and roll, along with ACDC's For Those About To Rock (We Salute You).  On this song, Ronnie Dio's vocals are very good as usual, strong and powerful, and perfectly complimenting the music.  I certainly can't imagine another singer doing this song better.    The lyrics are also (slightly) less mystical and more realistic on this album than on Rising.  I don't mind that at all.  It works here.  For example, the lyrics to The Shed sound more akin to ACDC.  Its about a night prowler (no talking/ Street Walking).  You can read the complete lyrics at [...]  Those that like the mystical lyrics will especially enjoy Lady of the Lake and Gates of Babylon.      Dio is at his absolute best on this album, full of power, strength and with a little tongue in cheek humor as well, which has always been characteristically his style, and something which has always endeared him to the fans.  Love to hear Dio deliver those lines in The Shed such as \\"I'm a wildcat, Don't need to prove that\\" and \\"It takes a strong hand to be a mean man\\".  Sure it sounds macho, but you can feel he is also trying to hide a laugh as well.    My other favorite tracks are Kill The King and LA Connection.  Absolutely Fantastic.  No singer could rival Dioon these tracks.  I think Kill The King is based on a bible story in the Old Testament where a jealous queen tries to kill a young boy king in a power struggle, but I'm not sure on this.    This album features the classic line up of Ronnie James Dio (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jimmy Bain (bass) and Cozy Powell (drums), and what a line up of heavy metal jouneymen and great musicians that is.  Bain later joined Dio on his 1980s albums such as Sacred Heart.  Overall, I can't recommend this album highly enough.  It is under-rated, sadly ignored and deserves much more credit than it ever gets.  Ronnie Dio's vocals here are stamped with authority and class, and he really makes each and every song uniquely his very own.  While Rising kinda feels like Blackmore's album, LLRR certainly feels like Dio's.  PS.  Loved the ballad Rainbow Eyes as well.    FOOTNOTE (added 9 June 2006):  Two other reviewers state that the bass player on this album was Bob Daisley.  I had always thought that it was Jimmy Bain - if wrong, I stand corrected. It's a great album regardless.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love this set, especially the documentary, which informed me a lot about the chaotic journey that Star Wars had before becoming so successful. I own the original versions on tapes as well as the DVD set and I have to say that I prefer the DVD version. Looking at alot of \\"special effects\\" in the original had me laughing out loud at how crappy they looked.

So go out and get this and the spirit of Pearl Jam...TURN IT UP AND ROCK OUT!!
B000063DHK|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out in 1985, as I was a huge Maiden fan back in the day.  Its hard possibly for some younger fans to understand how huge Maiden were back then, 1984-85.  They were definitely the biggest metal band in the world.  Metallica were still largely an underground band prior to the success of Master of Puppets which was released in 1986. <br /> <br />Maiden sold out five nights at LA's Long Beach Arena on their World Slavery Tour, and three of the four sides of the original LP version of this album were recorded at those LA shows. <br /> <br />The song listings here feature material from the first five studio albums, but mostly from the Bruce Dickinson era that began with the Beast album in 1982.  All the fan favorites are here and I admit I never much listened to Powerslave after this album came out, and I never bought Peace of Mind.  (Note: I still listened to Beast, because great songs such as Invaders, The Prisoner and Gangland appear on the Beast album only.) <br /> <br />Live After Death shows the band and the five members of what most fans consider the classic line up (Dickinson, Harris, McBrain, Murray and Smith) at their absolute peak in terms of creativity, energy and passion.  They are much a better live band than they were in the studio, because the energy and the passion are raised to a much higher level but the technical brilliance of the musicianship does not noticeably suffer. <br /> <br />Dickinson is great on this album, and you hear him stirring up and chatting to the Long Beach fans for extended periods of time with the classic lines such as \\"When I go back to England, I want to say to the hearing doctor Doctor, Long Beach f***ed up my hearing for good, alright\\" etc.  Vocally on the songs himself he is a powerhouse.  Only Halford and Dio can compare in my opinion. <br /> <br />Another great feature of the original 12 inch LP version was the thick color souvenir foto booklet and the fotos on the inside pages of the LP cover, which include large numbers of shots of the band taken on the World Slavery Tour.  For serious and younger fans, it might be worth picking up a copy of the 12 inch LP version of Live After Death from a second hand shop for the tour pics alone.  Btw, if you live in Perth, Australia, you could probably pick up a copy from Replay Records in Royal Street, Kenwick.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is a true hip-hop classis and is one the finest buys of 2004. When I first heard \\"Slow Jamz\\" it was an illegal bootleg and even though it was taking money away from the artist it intrigued me to maybe buy this album. Then I was in Chicago and all I heard on the radio was Kanye and R. Kelly. This made me realize I had to buy this album. Now when I bought this I expected a great hip-hop cd, but i didn't get that I got an excellent trip of hip-hop soul than just hip-hop. Kanye is a very soulful brother with purpose and vision behind his music. He felt he needed to make this album for his life and he did it in stunning fasion proving all the critics who said \\"oh he can make beats but he can't rap.\\" This album will definatly have catchphrases that you'll be saying for a while. Of course he has beats that carry a message behind them saying you are taking a part of his life and his struggle but he is confident that you will enjoy it. The first track is proof of his hip-hop soul fusion that will make you feel uplifted. Next is the Classic \\"All Falls Down\\" in which he is accompanied by the beautiful voice of Sylenna Johnson. This song is built around an acoustic guitar with a big thumping hip hop beat and all of his verses contain memorable lines like \\"(She) couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexis (A Lexus).\\" Tracks 5-10 range from the infamous \\"Jesus Walks\\" in whice he display his point of veiw of religion and music. Then he take us to new Gospel/Hip-Hop/Soul with \\"I Get Down\\" feturing legendary rapper Jay-Z and a spirital poem by John Legend. He also has the craftiness to include the Gospel Hymn \\"I'll Fly Away.\\" Then he delives \\"The Work-out Plan\\" another song with a acoustic guitar and the violin and a fast paced hip-hop beat which will have you dancing and clapping your hands. The next track is one of the biggest hits of 2004 \\"Slow Jamz\\" which brings the emergence of another Chicago rapper Twista and the vocals of Jamie Foxx creates a true hip-hop classic masterpiece with a sample from a Luther Vandross. Tracks 13 - 17 are songs like a rap duet with lyracist Ludacris with the sound of a dirty south grity song led with horns. Then he goes on a four track skit about how his life would have been if he went to college, which is hilarious! Then the next track \\"Two Words\\" is a pulse pounding hardcore rap hit with Freeway and Mos Def. Then he delivers his more personal side with the hit \\"Through The Wire\\" which he does his take of Chaka Kahn's \\"Through The Fire\\" in which he discusses his tragic auto crash which hampered the release of this album and almost took his life . Then the next track is a trip down memory lane with his family called \\"Family Buisness\\" in which some families can relate to. The final track of the album is a toast to his pre-meditated success called \\"Here's To The ROC\\" in which he tells the stuggles in which made him stronger and got him to the point where he is today. This is definatly a graduation for a drop-out from just being a \\"beat boy\\" to one of the biggest artist out today. I will end my review with a statment from Kanye himself \\"Many pepole asked me what will happen if I didn't make it...I guess the world will never know.\\"
B000002B1M|5.0|This classic has it all, from knocking beats, to street anthems, to a classic diss song \\"The Message\\" which rips 2pac to shreds! Anyways, this album was hated on by some purists because they didn't feel as though it lived up to the expectations after \\"Illmatic\\". But real hip hop heads know that this album is one of the top five albums of all time!
B0007O38F8|2.0|If you take 50's debut CD and all thats he's been saying about how great this new jaunt is, you'd obvioulsy expect it to be hot. I was way beyond dissapointed when I heard this CD. Its pretty much just average, the songs are alike, and it all just kinda runs together. The lyrical content is just not there. I dont know what happened with this, but I really wouldnt bother with it. It kinda makes sense all the beef with Game just started going down before he dropped this. It's gonna sell records. Cause after people hear this, his sales aren't gonna be so good. Thats my opinion, but I think he coulda done much better. If you wanna hear this CD, get a bootleg or download it, dont waste your money.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|D12 is the group of 6 people that there is. Good tracks like my band, 40z,I'm going to get my gun, and pshyo killer part2.Its been all round album to have. The album gets 5 out of 5
B000268QB2|1.0|Nothing on here that interests me at all except for that sunshine song, that's fairly good. All the other songs play it extremely safe.
B0000029GA|5.0|Although not quite as good as \\"It Was Written\\", Nas' first albun \\"Illmatic\\" is one of the best albums in hip hop history. There are 10 songs and none of them are fillers. There aren't many guests which means that we get to hear Nas rap about street life and growing up without any wack guests. Anyways, this should be in the collection of anyone who considers themselves a hip hop head!
B00030590I|5.0|This 2002 Chinese movie is an epic extravaganza in the best action film tradition.  It is much more than that, however, as it was conceived with a bigger purpose in mind.  It is not just about the swordplay.  It is about just what it takes to be a hero.  There are themes of love, vengeance and redemption as well as personal dramas inside of all the action.  This is the most expensive Chinese film ever made and I understand the Chinese army itself is cast as the extras.  It was filmed in a remote area of China where it was very windy.  And the scenes all reflect this.  For example there is one action scene with two women engaged in swordplay where golden leaves are blowing all around.<br /><br />The plot seems simple at first.  A swordsman is being honored for conquering a king's enemies.  But as the story unfolds, it is much more complicated than that and we see the same story told over again from several different points of view.  Each time our understanding of it deepens.  And although it is not realistic and could never quite happen this way (especially the choreographed action scenes) the theme is universal even though the plot is a little hard to follow.<br /><br />I have nothing but accolades for the people who brought this to America.  I understand that Quentin Tarantino was involved in this project.  He's seen in one of the extras on the DVD in an interview with the star, Jet Li.  There's also an excellent extra about the director, Zhang Yimou, which really enhanced my appreciation of the film I had just viewed and kept me up long after my bedtime just to relish every moment of it.<br /><br />I loved this film and give it a high recommendation.  It might not be for everybody.  But those who appreciate the art of filmmaking and the complexity of ideas will love it.

0143034901|3.0|That it's so tempting to read SHADOW OF THE WIND is a tribute to clever marketing. Comparisons to Marquez, Borges, and Dickens mix with gushing tributes from Stephen King and references to best-sellerdom in Spain. The literary come-on is hard to resist.<br /><br />In the end however, the way you respond to this book will depend on what expectations you bring to it. If you anticipate a reading experience worthy of those heady literary comparisons, you'll be sorely disappointed - Zafon is little closer to Garcia Marquez than Stephen King is. The closest he comes is having the temerity to give a minor character, a boyfriend of Beatriz Aguilar's, the family name Buendia, the prolific clan from ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE. If you plan, however, on a fantastical romp through a mid-century Barcelona converted wholesale into a gothic swamp of ghosts, shadows, haunted houses, malevolent, revenge-seeking, jilted lovers, swooning virginal maidens, improbably picaresque characters, unbelievable coincidences, parallelisms, and twists of fate, and a host of pseudo-Freudian relationships, you'll love every minute.<br /><br />The story line of SHADOW OF THE WIND is so complex and convoluted, it's nearly impossible to relate in less space than the book's own 487 pages. Suffice to say, the premise is drawn from the search of a teenaged boy named Daniel for the truth about the fate of Julian Carax, the author of a mystery story (also named \\"Shadow of the Wind\\") that Daniel has adopted and read after his bibliophilic father takes him on a \\"coming of age\\" excursion to the aptly metaphorical Cemetary of Forgotten Books. Carax has apparently written a number of other books, all of them commercial failures, yet someone has been traveling Europe to find and burn every extant copy of Carax's works.<br /><br />With twists and turns that would make the Minotaur's head spin in his Labyrinth, Zafon spins multiple parallel tales of Platonic love, blind love (both literal and figurative), failed love, enduring love, filial love, forbidden love, and unrequited love. Through it all looms the mystery of Julian Carax. Is he alive or dead? Who is burning his books, and why? Who is the char-faced phantom? Why does the evil Fumero seek such hate-filled revenge? Will young Daniel ever find his true love?<br /><br />Zafon's book could be easily parodied or brushed aside as little more than a Barbara Cartland romance, but his writing is better than that despite being too often over the top. From the opening page where Daniel describes his mother's death as \\"a deafening silence I had not learned to stifle with words,\\" Zafon mixes searing images and thoughtful observations with engagingly quirky characters such as Fermin Romero de Torres who capture the reader's imagination and heart like 20th century Sancho Panzas and Dulcineas to Daniel's idealistically questing Quixote.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these pluses are offset by unrelenting and heavy-handed atmospherics in which every page is marked by clouds, shadows, mists, flickering candles, twilights, smoke, rubble, ruins, twisted heaps, blood, and \\"glutinous darkness,\\" and the like. Florid prose abounds: \\"The white marble was scored with black tears of dampness that looked like blood dripping out of the clefts left by the engraver's chisel. They lay side by side, like chained maledictions.\\" Readers must also contend with two laughably miraculous conceptions, both occurring after first night trysts (a tribute perhaps to the ineffable virility of Spanish males?), and an unfortunately anachronistic request by a Barcelona doctor in 1954 for a \\"brain scan\\" of an injured Fermin (page 288).<br /><br />Net net, SHADOW OF THE WINDS is entertaining escapism with modest literary pretensions. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it to be more than it is.filial love, forbidden love, and unrequited love. Through it all looms the mystery of Julian Carax. Is he alive or dead?

6303014100|3.0|If your expecting God and Generals your not going to find it here. Lee is different, Jackson actor comes back as some hokey guy at the camp... I mean it bummed me out. Theres this one shot scene that shows Howe, and the guy that played Dumb and Dumber and its very artificial the background etc.,.. I know they are thinking they are being dramatic but we sorta had like this huge laugh over it. I think our society gets dumbed down because we watch so much junk daily... so many people will rate this pretty high. If your standards are Gods and Generals your going to be pretty bummed you paid 15 bucks for the dvd. If your standard is the common TV level movie fair...youll be full on for it. For me and my house... Id rather read a good book !
0743244249|4.0|I was reluctant to read this novel even though it was highly recommended.  That's because five years ago I read and reviewed \\"Underworld\\", another of this author's novels, and while I thought that the writing was brilliant, his world view was very disturbing. But I was curious about Cosmopolis. And it was short, a mere 209 pages long, a book I knew I could easily read in one sitting.  It took me more than one sitting to read however.  It actually took me several weeks.  That's because every time I put it down, I was reluctant to pick it up again.  Perhaps that's because it rings so true and its blows fall so close to home.  And, of course, the disturbing world view I had expected was there in all its glory.<br /><br />The characters aren't real.  They're not supposed to be.  Everything in this book is larger than life.  And everything has an exaggerated bitter sting to it.  The setting is New York City and the geography is familiar.  It's some time in the very near future, when big-moneyed corporate executives rule the world even more than they do now.  Eric, a 28-year old billionaire is one of them. The storyline is about him setting out to get a haircut and all the action takes place in a single day.<br /><br />Eric is in a white limousine which is equipped with every convenience the author could think of.  He has several bodyguards too, and a market analyst who interprets data from world markets constantly.  People visit him in his limo, including a doctor who gives him a daily physical.  Eric also manages to have romantic encounters with three different women as well as his wife.  He makes choices that have him lose his fortune in the stock market.  His car is attacked by anarchists.  He has to pause and watch a funeral for a rap musician. And he even gets involved in working as an extra in a strange and upsetting film. And, early on in the book, the reader knows Eric is hurtling towards real disaster.<br /><br />But the book is more than this storyline of course.  It is an indictment of the capitalist system that once held out such hope.  It shows the shallowness of the people, making every single character seem like a little marionette on strings and the whole tale one big puppet show.<br /><br />This is a fine book.  It is a worthwhile read.  I just can't help it though.  I hated it.<br /><br />Recommended only for literary buffs who relish discomfort.of course.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kayne West is good rapper. He has good tracks like jesus walk, workoutplan,Breathe in breathe with ludacris,. Jay-z is also on the album. I would give this album 3 of 5.
B0007O38F8|1.0|alright this cd is as plain as this, boo. this nigga 50 is talkin bout how he changed the rap game with his great albums. listen he only got one cd and he thinks he is the best ever, and that first cd wasnt that great. and trust me this new one is wack. he got the nerve to go on radio and tell out rappers record sales when this nigga only got record sales off a one album. this cd will probably sell off of hype and thats it cuz once people pop it in its disappointment. so straight up buy The Game's album because its the most diverse cd on the market right now!
B0000TLA9G|1.0|this is the worst g'n'r album yet. Does it just get worse and worse? AFD awsome, Lies still good, UYI1 good, UYI2 o.k., SI what???!!!! now this? If your a radio fan of G'n'R, then buy this, 'cause its got all the &quot;hits&quot;. Wheres Mr.Brownstone??? Used to Love Her?? Why the slower songs?? G'n'R is about rock, not ballads and power ballads and Axl Roses self indulgence. Wanna a G'n'R compilation? Make your own, save your dollars on this and buy Velvet Revolver. This is the album that the gunners should have released. Imagine Axl on Sucker Train Blues... beautiful
B0007MVXQG|4.0|I am an old metal head.  34 and I long for the days before Nirvana and grunge.  Give me AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Dio, Black Sabbath, even Cinderella, and I'm happy.  It's nice to see these old Brits back in action.  I liked Painkiller, and this new album is good.  My favorite song is the haunting LOCHNESS, which I swear I have played 20 times since I got the album three days ago.  Maybe with the continued popularity of Ozzy, the return of Motley Crue, and the continual return of things once popular, METAL will reemerge!!!!!!!
B00006JJ51|5.0|One of first group to tell us about the gangster live. Hits likes F _ _ _ tha Police, Gangsta Gangsta and Straight Outta Compton.I give it 5 out of 5.
B000000P17|4.0|Just recently purchased this album and listened to it all the way through. <br /> <br />Good points: <br />Slash still remains fairly strong with the solos <br />Duff surprisingly sings alot more this time, he too is a great singer <br />Some decent songs like New Rose, Black leather, hair of the dog etc <br /> <br />Bad points:  <br />No Izzy this time, Gilby Clarke stands in for him, Don't get me wrong Gilby is also a great guitarist but he's just not the same as Izzy. <br />No original GN'R material <br />They show their punkier side this time which isn't exactly what guns were previously about. <br /> <br />Overall this album isn't too bad.  The best description I can give is that they seem to have covered a selection of punk songs and made it sound more like GN'R.  Punk fans will love this album.  You have to really appreciate punk to like this album, I have nothing against punk but its not what I am into as much as rock or metal.  If you want to know what it sounds like then try and imagine 'Get in the ring' type tracks 12 times.  The thing with this album is that it doesnt seem to be the GN'R that everyone knew and loved in the previous days.  I personally think GN'R were pretty much over after the use your illusion tours.  I am a huge fan of the band, but when you have their previous albums you will find it is the most disappointing album.  If you already have their classic albums and don't have this then its up to you-take my advice if you like.  But if you are new to Guns, just make sure you steer clear of this album for now, and just get Appetite and the illusion albums first. <br />
0201721481|4.0|[A review of the 4th EDITION 2005]<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the most distinguished of the numerous books on C++. Its authors have a long involvement with the development and teaching of the language. The book presents itself as a definitive text on C++, much like Kernighan and Ritchie's C manual is for C. So it teaches exhaustively on the attributes of C++ and also on what you can do at the preprocessor and compiler level.<br /><br />The presentation style seems to echo K&R and is roughly at about the same level of difficulty, in terms of how concepts and syntax are explained. No flashy multihued graphics in the book. The authors have eschewed these in favour of a few schematics to illustrate key ideas like pointers, where you really do need some diagrams.<br /><br />As a very useful aid, they have included many exercises, sprinkled through each chapter. Some exercises are rather simple. Which is perhaps deliberate; to give you confidence in items you can easily tackle.<br /><br />Not having seen an earlier edition, I am unsure how substantive the differences between this text and its predecessors really is. C++ has been pretty stable for several years. Unlike still changing languages like Java and C#. So if you have an earlier edition of the book, you may not necessarily need to upgrade to this edition.
B000067G3C|4.0|Yes, SPEED Is one heck of a ride, from its tense elevator opening to the sheer agony of riding on a bus that could explode at any minute.  Yes, Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper and Sandra Bullock are great in their roles, and the movie moves along at warp speed, a rare exercise in adrenaline-inspired action.  My problem with the movie ultimately is SPEED should have ended after the bus exploded.  The writers could have come up with a more interesting and definite ending for Hopper's character.  The addition of the speeding train only proved an excess to what had been a crisp, fluent movie.  By going this far over the limit of audience tolerance, DeBont and crew sabotaged what should have been a five star movie.  But up until the poorly conceived ending, SPEED is one fun ride.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I can't don't even have much to say besides the fact that it sucks.  SP has a mixtape out called Super Mario that is hotter than this album.  He has about two tracks on this album that are good.  But this album is a dissapointment to fans and the hip-hop community.  Spend your money elsewhere.... If you buy the album you'll wish you hadn't.  The first album was hot.  This one is a dud!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I first discovered Muse while browsing my local record shop where they have \\"Listening Stations\\" set up throughout the store featuring unknown bands.  I came into the store set on bringing Keane's album home with me. But the Muse CD caught my eye at the listening station, and when #1 Intro and #2 Apocalypse Please (which I thought were 1 song) came marching and dancing into my ears, I fell in love.  It just took that one (or rather 2) song(s) to catch my attention and my heart.  I knew I had to take this album home just based on that first song.  Apocalypse Please is a rare gem of a piece that captures your heart and parades you through an ocean's deep of emotions and music.  There were so many layers of waves washing over me I could only stand still with my eyes closed and let myself be taken out to this writhing sea called Muse.  Apocalypse Please truly is a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album proved just as monumental.  It immediately captured me.  I promptly purchased it and took it home to listen to loudly in the safety of my own room.  I simply had to play the CD on repeat over and over again, lying still on my bed and allowing myself to be marched on this musical journey.  I personally do not notice much similarity between Muse and Radiohead.  My friends have even mentioned how they sound alike, but I never heard it.  I used to be a Radiohead fan, but I still do not notice it.   <br /> <br />With pieces such as Time Is Running Out sinking into your mind with a constantly changing sound, Sing for Absolution begging you to sing along with all your soul, and Ruled By Secrecy drifting you along through the clouds, you are in for one amazing ride as you listen to Muse's \\"Absolution.\\"  <br /> <br />Stockholm Syndrome has a heavier, more rock vibe. But it's just as addictive.  Matt's voice sings beautifully over the full and complex music composed of heavy guitar, drums, and even piano. <br /> <br />I find my whole body responding to this music.  It seems impossible to simply listen to Muse. Your body responds with movement and you truly feel as if you are moving on a journey with the music as it serenades you into a land that I never want to leave when I'm there. Matt's range is incredible and he exercises it on almost every song.   <br /> <br />Falling Away With You lets you catch your breath as you relax into a sweet serenade at the beginning of the song.  Don't let the music fool you--the lyrics still reach the depth that the rest of \\"Absolution\\" plummets to.  As the song picks up, you move along to Matt's emotion-filled voice and \\"bitter love story\\" lyrics.  It ends with a quiet and moving goodbye, which leaks into #7 Interlude. Then you enter immediately into #8, Hysteria.  Immediately you brace yourself for a real rock anthem.  The beginning drum beats remind me of Silverchair's \\"Anthem for the Year 2000.\\" But you quickly realize Muse has carved out a sound all their own.  This is their current reigning single, which is climbing the charts both on radio and MTV here in the States.  This up-beat tempo gives you inspiration to dance, or even mosh if one so desires. <br /> <br />After the rush is over, #9, Blackout, is there to lift you up on a magic-carpet ride over the clouds. This is one of my favorites on the album.  <br /> <br />#10, Butterflies and Hurricanes picks up the speed slowly, allowing you to enter back into the rush after the sweet, slow ride of Blackout.  The message of the chorus is both encouraging and overwhelming: <br />\\"Best, you've got to be the best <br />You've got to change the world <br />and use this chance to be heard. <br />Your time is now.  <br />Don't let yourself down. <br />...your last chance has arrived.\\" <br /> <br />#11 Small Print reminds me of a charged punk rock ballad. The lyrics are dark and brooding and thought-provoking.  <br /> <br />#12 Endlessly is the only song that begins like it may not belong on the Muse album. But that thought is quickly brushed away as Matt sings of an endless love. This song is the only one where I can imagine a similarity between Muse and Radiohead.  <br /> <br />#13 Thoughts of a Dying Atheist carries a theme that is drifting throughout this album. It seems to me that the lyrics and song titles leak out little hints that perhaps the song writer is searching for a religious truth that they're on the brink of discovering.  That perhaps they are actually exploring the possibilities of God and death and Hell, etc. and may not be entirely secure in their beliefs at this point, but have a curiosity and a question in their minds. (Matthew Bellamy penned all the song lyrics.)    <br /> <br />Ruled by Secrecy brings this ride to a close as you gently float on still waters, drifting further and further out to a dark, deep sea.   <br /> <br />Muse has burst upon us in America with a unique and mind-blowing album that simply cannot be left untouched.  It must be played.  It demands to be listened to and experienced.  I feel I can only oblige.
B0007P3582|5.0|Before I tell you what an amazing album this is, stop giving 50 1 star reviews cuz he's having problems with other rappers. GET OVER IT! 50 probably just doesn't like them we've all had people we just didn't like. And as for all the apologizing he didn't put them up to it so all that proves is they just breakdown in tough situtaitions. Take you hatin somewhere else. <br /> <br />Anyway, this album is truly amazing. Nearly every song on here has the potential of becoming a single. The CD is a combination of all emotions. It'll fit any mood you're in. I expected this album to be like a Nelly CD. A few good hits and that's all, but it turned out to be so much more.
6305181772|5.0|I've viewed this classic over and over, and it continues to amaze me that Ethan Hunt never killed one person in this version,\\"Zero body count\\" nor did he ever fire a gun.  Excellent scenery in the always BEAUTIFUL Europe.  Excellent story, excellent excitement, excellent entertainment.  Enjoy!
1400082773|4.0|I didn't take Professor Obama's courses in law school.  They seemed too nebulous - \\"Voting Rights\\" or \\"Racism and the Law\\".  But now I wish I had taken his classes.  Very few people, and extremely rare for a US Senator, have the kind of upbringing Mr. Obama had.  Hawaii, Indonesia, back to Hawaii, LA, NY, Chicago, Kenya.  The people of these places play different roles and shape Senator Obama's thinking on poverty, racism, blacks in America and so forth.  While this book was written after his stint at law school, he doesn't write about law school.  I would be very interested to read about his experience in law school, his adventures as a lawyer and state senator in Illinois and his life as a US Senator.  But I will have to wait a few more years for that book.<br /><br />Overall - read this book - it is an inspiration to humanity and a step to learning about one of the most important political figures in the 21st century (or so I predict).
0767834739|3.0|Resident Evil 2 was quite a good seqeul. It had enough action in it to keep me satisfied. The story although quite lacked in originality and was quite flat at times. But the movie did have some good scares and had way more action than the first movie. <br /> <br />Pros: More Action Than The First, Scary, Suspensful, Enjoyable Cast, Watchable. <br /> <br />Cons: Unoriginal, Flat At Times. <br /> <br />Overall: 2 1/2 stars
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Wow! This album is a reflection of a woman that takes life and her career seriously. She's unlike those other broads who talk about shakin their ass & things that don't mean a damn thing in the real world.It's true life from a strong, independent woman. Definately need this one.
B0007O38F8|2.0|All that sh*t talking and nothing to back it up. I thought for sure all the hype about this albumn that this was going to be another classic. WRONG. \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying\\" was it. 50, in my opinion rushed this one. he helped put out The Games cd at the same time he was trying to do his thing and his own CD flopped. This CD could have been 10X's better than what it is. This sounds more like mix tape material, not his real stuff. 50, I'm disappointed!!!! what a dissapointment to everyone!!!!
B0006FO8RA|5.0|The bestselling artist in the 21st century Britney Spears summarizes with this collection first six years of her outstanding career and shows her story from teenage sensation to icon of pop-culture. She started with simple catchy pop songs which were written for her just to be hits, but in the 21st century she was converted to less commercial r'n'b and club music instead of selling incredible amount of records and above all she began to write her own songs. This album is a certificate of evolution from manufactured teen idol to professional artist.    Spears has as many fans as anti-fans, so there are varied opinions about her music. But we must to admit that facts are on Spears' side, because her music achieved not only commercial success with 60 million sold albums and almost twenty hits all over the world, but above all artistic with numerous nominations to the most prestigious music awards including Grammy. And no words can take it back from her. It's simply high quality pop music, that's all. Isn't it ridiculous that such innocent music causes so much anger or even hate in some people? Thanks to this strange mystery these people make Spears' music uncommon in some way.    Spears with all these hits took over the throne from Queen of Pop Madonna and Queen of R'n'B Janet Jackson. That's why she sold much more records during her career than Madonna and Janet put together in the same period of time! And such hits like: \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\", \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" or \\"Toxic\\" are classics in history of pop music already.     Unfortunately this is a US edition of this set, which means the poorest one. It has only 17 songs (14 international hits and 3 brand new tunes), because it omits these two hits from standard international version of this album, which were released on singles only overseas \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"I Love Rock'n'Roll\\". But why Britney's record company didn't put here a million-seller US hit \\"From The Bottom Of My BrokenHeart\\" and chose little hit \\"Outrageous\\" instead of much bigger \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\". There is also a special edition of this album where you can find a bonus CD with 6 very interesting remixes and \\"Megamix\\" of Britney's biggest hits.    Like you see it's better to buy the most expanded version of this album, which contains 20 songs (with both non-US singles and \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" as well) and which is also available in special version with bonus CD with all 6 remixes and \\"Megamix\\".     And it's only beginning...
0064471837|5.0|As a book lover, my teacher, who shares the same interests in books as me, introduced me to the series. I read Sabriel, and loved it. When I found out there were two more to the series, I couldn't wait to get my hands on them. To anyone looking for adventure and mystery, I recomend this book, and the entire series to you. Please enjoy, as I have.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I learned about India Arie after seeing her perform live on TV.  Soul doesn't begin to describe this girl.  She's everything that old school, honest, bluesy soul music was about and then she added guitar riffs.  Her voice is hands down one of the best with unique twist and her lyrics actually say more than \\"I hate men...my boyfriend sucks.\\"  I'm pretty confident if you get this album you'll never feel the need skip past a song.  Each one is for the most part awesome.  I'd say my favorites would have to be Promises, Brown Skin, I See God in You, and Beautiful, but again, I could pretty much listen to each of them when I put the CD on.  Why this girl isn't more commercially successful is beyond me.  Buy the album.  It's insane.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|This film is about Mr. Clark who has a boring life with wife and daughter, until he by accident sees a girl (Jennifer Lopez) by a window outside a dancing school. He follows his intuition, which tells him to start ball dancing. What he really wants is to catch a glimps of Paulina. This is a beginning of... I don't know, a following of Mr. Clark mainly and a few glimpses here and there of the wife and Paulina and a little this and that.  <br />I like Jennifer Lopez and use to think her acting is rather good. I went and saw this on cinema with a friend because we had free tickets, but truthfully I feel that it wouldn't have been worth it to pay a lot of money for it, when you can just rent it. Well, it would be the thing that it's nice to see the dancing on a big screen. So I don't regret that I saw it. I liked it even though some things were pretty dull.  <br />Firstly I found the plot rather weak. Ok, Gere has his problems and he starts ball dancing accidentally and this obstinate, in-misery-J.Lo is a bit of a confused character, but the acctual PLOT has gone missing somewere!  <br />But since I love dancing, and part from the sham plot and the various clichs, it was an enjoyable 147 minutes because there was a lot of dancing and wonderful dresses and clothes! I just fell flat for Jennifer Lopez simple skirts and dresses in graceful, following fabrics. All that was so appealing that I don't mind the bad plot and Gere's clichs (even though he was very good as an actor, as always) and all that. I can't complain over Susan Sarandon's part either, even though she had a weak and boring character.  <br />And you can work the end out on your own, right?
B000683VI4|5.0|Let me take you back to a time when love was all around, but so was stereotypes.  This story centers around a couple that grew to love eachother during a very short period of time (Summer). Against her parents wishes (mainly her mother) Allie falls in love with a boy that does not have the status that the family wishes he had to date thier daughter. Even through Allie and Noah separating, she off to college, and he staying in town, Allie falling in love with someone else, and planning to marry him, the question of true love is always in the forefront.  In the end, Allie finds out who her true love is and will always be...Noah! <br />An endearing film of love, The Notebook is something no one should miss.  <br />Oh yeah, and at the end...get your kleenex....it is going to be a tear jerker!!
B00000AFHM|5.0|This music reminds me of my parents music. It is so melodic and I can just sing along. The lyrics don't matter. I don't even get them and I don't care. This is just good music. It's so fun. My kids think I am cool now.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|\\"Frances the Mute\\" is a great second effort. While it is more listenable and coherent than \\"Deloused in the Crematorium\\", it is still a very incredibly complex and intense effort. This is the kind of CD that should be listened to over headphones while under the influence of some kind of illicit substance. If you like and miss the classic works of Pink Floyd, Rush, or the odder Zeppelin tunes, you simply must own this disc. <br /> <br />Many people will undoubtedly compare Bixler-Zavala's vocals to Robert Plant, but to this listener, it is the drumming that truly evokes shades of Zeppelin. Has anyone hit drums so hard since \\"Bonzo\\" met his untimely end? I think not.  <br /> <br />All in all, its a virtuosic effort by just about every member of TMV. Imagine, if you will, a world where the Pink FLoyd of \\"Dark Side\\", the Zeppelin of \\"Physical Graffiti\\", and the Rush of \\"2112\\" all decided to collaborate on one incredibly trippy record. That, I think, sums it up in a nut shell.
B00018D44U|4.0|This is the next big great American voice. Like a Whitney and so much hipper than Madonna.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Richard Gere has everything going for him--a loving wife, two good kids, a beautiful home, and a career as a lawyer.  What is it then that causes him to look up each night from his commuter train and watch dance instructor, Jennifer Lopez, through the window of Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio?  Something is missing in his life and he is determined to find out what.  Soon he succumbs to the attraction of Lopez, and begins taking dance lessons.  Teamed with an oversized, good-natured man who hopes to win his dream girl (Omar Benson Miller), and a man who looks at dancing as a way to meet girls (Bobby Cannavale), Gere looks stiff and out-of-place in his lawyerly pin-striped suit.  In spite of a rough beginning, the three men make real progress and are soon enjoying their dancing experiences.  The supporting cast in this movie is delightful, from Gere's wife (Susan Sarandon) to the \\"closet dancer\\" (Stanley Tucci) to the over-the-top, loud-mouthed blond (Lisa Ann Walter).  In the course of the dancing lessons, each character begins to discover his true self, and to be able to express that self to others.  A real sense of comraderie develops between the characters which is separate, but no threat to their lives outside the dance studio.  This is a delightful movie!
B00005QK3B|5.0|If you have heard Marillion at some point in your life, chances are this is the album you've heard. \\"Kayleigh\\" and \\"Lavender\\" became pervasive songs of their time, and forever after. But truth be told, they only tell part of the story of this, one of the best prog rock albums ever to be released.<br /><br />Marillion started in the early eighties, with a strong influence from Genesis and Pink Floyd, and a lead singer (Fish) who imitated Peter Gabriel both visually and sonically. \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" was the band's third full length album, following \\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\" and \\"Fugazi\\". With this album they showed everyone what they were capable of, by displaying a concept album telling the story of Fish's broken heart through the album's ten songs.<br /><br />From the opening chords of \\"Pseudo Silk Kimono\\", all the way into the famous \\"Kayleigh\\" and \\"Lavender\\", the album prepares you for the musical trip that lies ahead, broken into two main parts (which constituted sides A and B of the album). \\"Waterhole\\" starts a fast-paced 'side B' leading into the album's high points, with the multi-part \\"Blind Curve\\" standing out above the rest for its change of rhythm and melody in a way that had long become part of the Marillion signature sound by the time of this release.<br /><br />If you want to start your Marillion collection, this is an excellent place to do it. Plus it's also a fabulous starting point for a prog rock collection too, if you haven't started yours by now. Other references to look for: in Marillion discography, \\"Brave\\" and \\"Marbles\\" (both post-Fish); other modern pro rock bands, IQ and Flower Kings.

B0001ENY6M|5.0|This Soundtrack is so beatiful. When I hear it, it is almost as if I am seeing the story. The music is just so powerful that it takes me back to the time of Jesus and I see the whole story as depicted in John through this music, it is wonderful. Although it does choke me up when I hear it sometimes, I can't help but listen to it. Amazing Score.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|The re-releasing of the 70's-80's albums of George Harrison's solo carrer does come as a tremendous gifts, not only to his hardcore loyal fans, but also to casual music listeners. This album is a great example of that.  <br /> <br />Without receiving the tremendous airplay that All Things Must Pass had gotten in 1970-71 (and deservedly so!), nor getting the bad reviews that albums like Dark Horse or Extra Texture had gotten in the previous years, and having quite good sales, even climbing onto the Billboard Top 20 in the United States, George Harrison was an album that didn't have that many resonance in those days. Its soft-rock, laid-back approach was perhaps not as attractive to late 70's music fans as some other new movements in music. <br /> <br />But the songs have aged so well, mostly because most of them are really good. \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\", the opener, is quite modest musically, featuring guitar work by Eric Clapton and some simplistic lyrics about the availability and universality of love, a theme which Harrison would explore further in upcoming releases, but it sets the tone to the album very properly. Its soft nature and relaxing mood fits perfectly the upcoming tracks: the Beatles' leftover \\"Not Guilty\\", which had been recorded by the band in a rocker approach, with no less than 100 takes before being dumped and not released in 1968's White Album, receives here an 'unplugged' treatment, with acoustic guitars and synthesisers replacing the distorted electric guitars and harpischord in the original. The change also affects the tone of the lyrics, which in this time do not sound that offended, but rather, more clever. In the same way, \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\", with its psychedelic references about hallucinogen mushrooms and oniric trips comes in handy when taking the spot for the typical Harrison humour, with a very ironic arrangement which ends up in a Beatles-reminiscent manner, too. The top-20 single \\"Blow Away\\" might be one of Harrison's best contributions to the charts since \\"Give Me Love\\", with its uplifting and optimsitic lyrics, combining with adequate dosis of acoustic guitars, slide guitars (already a trademark of his albums) and synthesisers, with great results in a precious nature imagery. The other single, \\"Faster\\", does not reach the same results, perhaps suffering from a little bit of overproduction, being a great song nonetheless, talking about the racing sport and exploring candid metaphores about competitions in life. <br /> <br />Nothing could really be considered \\"rock\\" here, it's more a pop album with some rock elements, like the Oberheim synthesiser placed in the uplifting \\"If You Believe\\", a great optimistic closer to the album (\\"everything you thought is possible / if you believe\\"). But overall, the mood is dominated by the softness of the more delicate compositions. Harrison's newly found spiritual life is joined by two precious acoustic ballads tributes to his wife (\\"Dark Sweet Lady\\") and son (\\"Soft Touch\\"), which sort of remind of the climate of Hawaii, the place where they were actually composed; and the omnipresent search is found on the beautiful sequel to The Beatles' \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", \\"Here Comes The Moon\\", which is a little more obscure than the predecessor, but still a nice song. <br /> <br />Another paragraph must be taken to speak about the one that is probably George's greatest ballad (and one has to remember that it's Harrison the one who wrote things like \\"Something\\" or \\"Beautiful Girl\\"), and probably his most underrated tune ever, \\"Your Love Is Forever\\", which comprises moving arpegios of electric/acoustic guitars, with an overdubbing that makes them more emotional, and delicate touches of synth, bass, snare drums and piano, with a carefully arrangement of the lead and backing vocals and dreamy, glorious lyrics (\\"I feel it and my heart knows you're the One / The guiding light in all your love shines on / The only lover worth it all / Your love is forever\\"); which, as always,present the duality between spiritual and human love, which shouldn't be excluding necessarily. <br /> <br />This edition includes a new cover (small change: the title of the album being replaced by a hand-written George signature), a remastered form which rescues the softest tracks (particularly \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\") from oblivion and low volumes of mix, and a demo version of \\"Here Comes The Moon\\" which is a nice bonus treat since George was a fantastic acoustic guitar player and here we get the pleasure to hear him strumming the chords to provide the basis of a gentle melody. <br /> <br />Overall, I think George Harrison reached peace of mind while composing and recording this album, and this pleasure of living comes through the listeners' ears while hearing it, giving him comfort and a relaxing experience, adorned with beautiful lyrics and arrangements. A delicate and underrated gem.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|This album is pretty decent, but like other reviewers noticed, the actual content of this album is a little sparse. The songs that are there are very good, but lets face it, Pink Floyd has already tapped out the psychadelic arena. All the wierd, trippy sound effects and samples sound like they were copied and pasted from any number of PF albums. Deloused was definatly much much better, more satisfying and even the mix sounded a little better.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|After the sales failure that his 1982 album Gone Troppo was, George Harrison decided to retire 'to be a gardener'. When he came back five years later, he returned with a winner, and a big contender as the best album of his carrer: Cloud Nine (1987), co-produced by Jeff Lynne, features some of his best work, in lyrical terms, adorned by exquisite instrumental ornaments and great production skills.  <br /> <br />This is an album in which George Harrison uses positively his Beatles/rock'n'roll background and takes advantage of the innovation on sounds and songwriting that he had been experiencing in the previous years. In lyrical terms, his words are honest as always, talking almost all the time in the first person, singing about that complete love that he defined as \\"both divine and human\\", and thus writing precious love songs that can also be thought of as prayers (\\"That's What It Takes\\", \\"This Is Love\\"), and vice-versa (\\"Fish On The Sand\\", \\"Just For Today\\"). In other tunes he uses the perfectly acid sense of humour to make criticisms about the modern society, or the lifestyles that he condemned (\\"Wreck Of The Hesperus\\", \\"Devil's Radio\\"). And in some other tracks he just wants to have fun (\\"Got My Mind Set On You\\") or to laugh at himself (\\"Wreck Of The Hesperus\\"). Sound-wise, this is a typically 80's album, with a big amount of synthesisers and synchronized drums (played live nonetheless, by Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner). The key is that the instruments are perfectly distributed into each track to make them sound tight and solid. Here, the synthesisers are used as an extra ingredient and not as the main part of the songs, and each track is carefully thought as a radio-friendly track. And it works perfectly: this album had at least three very succesful singles, and made George return to the top 10 albums list after a eight years. <br /> <br />The sincere and simple work of the sincere and special man that George Harrison was is evident throughout the complete album. \\"Cloud Nine\\", the album opener, featuring a breath-taking guitar duel between Harrison and friend Eric Clapton, sets the mood with a bluesy pattern, as a very special invitation to the lover (\\"take my smile and my heart / they were yours from the start\\"). You can see here the maturity of George, a man who had already lived a lot, and now appreciated the estability and happiness that his family life had brought to him. In \\"That's What It Takes\\" (tune co-written with Jeff Lynne and Gary Wright) we have a perfect sample of what great pop music is supposed to sound like, joined in by a gorgeous lyric about the search for spirituality. \\"Fish On The Sand\\" and \\"Wreck Of The Hesperus\\" both feature interesting rock arrangements, but discuss very different themes: whilst the first one is one of the spiritual/material love duality ballads, the second one is one of the most ironic tunes George ever wrote, laughing at himself and the issues regarding growing old. \\"Just For Today\\" features a message to everyone (\\"don't try to deal with everything all at once\\", as George said in an interview), and it's one of those emotional tunes, perfectly crafted and produced to make you feel comfortable and moved at the same time. \\"This Is Love\\" (co-written with Lynne) is another perfect example of a great pop song, again speaking about the solemnity of earthly love when it's compared to heavenly love, and featuring a mesmerizing slide guitar solo that has to be the best that George ever did, in his calm stlye of course.  <br /> <br />Other highlights include the perfect Beatles parody \\"When We Was Fab\\" (another Lynne/Harrison collaboration which was a worldwide hit), which uses all the machinery needed to reproduce a Beatles song from the psychedelic years (including elements from songs like \\"I Am The Walrus\\", \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\" and many meta-references which are just too fun to point out); the very serious (but also tongue-in-cheek) tone of protest against gossiping that \\"Devil's Radio\\" is (\\"gossip is devil's radio -- don't be a broadcaster); the moving ballad \\"Someplace Else\\", which was written specifically for the much maligned Shangai Surprise movie featuring Madonna and Sean Penn and has a nice arrangement; and the highly underrated \\"Breath Away From Heaven\\", to me, the best song on the album, an overwhelming oriental imagery with bright lyrics (\\"like an opallescent moon all alone in the sky of a foreign land\\") and precious musical arrangements. <br /> <br />And to put just a happy ending to all of this you get the latest HUGE solo-Beatle hit, \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\", the last #1 single for George Harrison, a cover of an old Rudy Clark tune that had a fantastic vocal/instrumental arrangement, which made it such an unexpected success song all over the globe. <br /> <br />Contributers include producer Jeff Lynne on bass, guitars, keyboards and background vocals; Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner on drums; Eric Clapton on guitar (notably on the title track and \\"Devil's Radio\\"); and Elton John and Gary Wright on piano among others. And although the album already had a great, clear sound, this 2004 remaster also helped to make it a little bit better, adding two bonus tracks from the Shangai Surprise movie (the title track, sung by George with Vicki Brown, mother of Sam Brown who sang \\"Horse To The Water\\" in the Concert For George tribute in 2003; and the nonsensical crazy instrumental Lynne/Harrison instrumental \\"Zig Zag\\" which was used as the B-side to \\"When We Was Fab\\"), albeit excluding other tracks from the very same soundtrack (like \\"Hottest Gong In Town\\" and alternate versions of \\"Breath Away From Heaven\\" and \\"Someplace Else\\") and from other contemporary sources (\\"Cheer Down\\", \\"Cockamamie Business\\" and \\"Poor Little Girl\\" from the already out-of-print compilation Best Of Dark Horse 1976-1989; \\"Lay His Head\\" from the B-side to \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\"). The inclusion of these songs in some other form would be fantastic to music fans and especially for collectors.  <br /> <br />But this album is already complete with the primitive soundtrack, which allows the work to be completely developed and delivered to the listener. It's actually a pleasure to one's ears to hear this music, with George in the maturity of his vocals and slide guitar talent skills, and a production of superlative quality. Undoubtedly the best album of the 80's, and of course, a must have.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie tells the story of Salvation in an impressively real manner, which should be very close to the way things were done at the time of the Roman occupation of Israel. The love of God for Humanity and the sacrifice of His only begotten Son for the Salvation of Mankind provides a glimpse of the Infinite Nature of God's Compasion towards His creatures. This excellent movie is a call to reality, because Christians are used to a sanitized version of the crucified Christ which must be very far from the reality of that time. Knowing what Christ and His Mother really went through, as well as the way in which other followers were affected by the Passion, sheds a lot of light on events we tend to take for granted or at least see in an merely abstract fashion.  <br /> <br />
B0007P3582|4.0|the massacre was a pretty good album from 50 cent. that has songs that is very gangsta. and is the most anticipated cd of 2005.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I don't know what Diana Krall was thinking when she made this CD.  Maybe she thought shifting away from jazz would increase her popularity.  Well, I don't think so... not if this is the result.  Its a very boring, uninspiring CD with unremarkable songs.  Thankfully, she has started to move back toward jazz with her CD \\"The Girl In The Other Room.\\"
B000069HK2|5.0|I bought the used' newest cd first and it was so good i had to check this one out, sure enough its even better. now if your looking for anythign groundbreaking or original don't look here, they have a unique style but are just like AFI and many other punk sorta bands this being said, they do have soul and burt seems to deliver a great deal of passion when singing definetly worth a listion!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Here we go again.  Another incredible chapter in the continuing musical saga bestowed upon us by the Pat Metheny Group. <br /> <br />An incredible poignant musical journey.  Remarkable musicianship.  With each listening to this opus, new discoveries abound. <br /> <br />
B00000I01A|5.0|I was not aware of this soundtrack, until I seen it on Amazon, so I bought it (Along with the original Rocky). The training session in Siberia, with Rocky running up the mountain is a classic, and \\"Heart's On Fire\\" really fits the scene perfectly. Throw in \\"Eye Of The Tiger\\" (From Rocky 3), and you have an unbeatable CD. A must have CD, and it will be a favorite of mine and I have over 200 CDs. Rocky Balboa is one of the greatest characters in the history of cinema, and the music really enhances the films even more. I can't wait until it arrives, it will be played over and over at the gym.
B00005JN0T|5.0|First of all, if you're an Asimov fan, you're probably aware that the script of \\"I, Robot\\" is only tangentially based on Asimov's robot novels and stories.  The screenwriters, though, make no attempt to disguise that, claiming the script was \\"Suggested by Isaac Asimov.\\"  If you are not an Asimov fan, I should warn you that, for example, his \\"starter\\" robot book, \\"The Caves of Steel,\\" is so totally different from this movie, it's like they're not even from the same universe.<br /><br />My work schedule is such that I can only see movies during the summer, but each summer I see dozens and dozens.  Last summer, for example, I saw practically everything playing at the theaters within the space of a few days.  \\"I, Robot\\" was the film I liked the most.  I vowed I would get the DVD as soon as it became available.<br /><br />What I liked most about this movie was the script.  It was by turns funny, suspenseful, thought-provoking, etc.  In fact, it's a really good script to study if you're into writing your own:  it can boast textbook models of how a writer should handle reversals, foreshadowing, payoff, character arc, etc.  And the conclusion and the prelude both made sense, total sense!  In short, not a line out of place.<br /><br />Other things that could sink the movie are held in check: Will Smith, while perhaps not the ideal candidate for the job, delivers a believable and versatile performance.<br /><br />The special effects shots help the movie along, rather than drag it in their wake.  What noticeable shots there are really do more to creep you out than overawe you (e.g., the horde of evil robots scaling the USR building).<br /><br />I was very surprised to read many reviews of this movie (after I saw it), which panned it.  It is very difficult for me to see how somebody could see this as a stinker, and I'm the kind of guy who usually only likes about 1 out of every 20 movies I see.<br /><br />Naturally, there's zero depth to the film, of course; as long as you know this beforehand, you'll be unlikely to regret investing a couple of hours in this movie.as you know this beforehand, you'll be unlikely to regret investing a couple of hours in this movie.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This was worth every penny. Mav and Lisa's vocals stand out the most to me. 15 Year old Chloe has a great clarity to her voice, but can seem thin at times. Great traditional Irish music, and modern music. Mirad Nesbitt soars on fiddle just as she did in Maichael Flately's \\"Lord Of The Dance\\" and \\"Feet of Flames\\".  I totally recommend you see the DVD and then get the CD for the music. If you are a fan of angelic voices and celtic music then you will not be disappointed.
0375703861|3.0|If you're familiar with the film \\"Wonderboys,\\" you may remember the giant opus and monument to post-modern self indulgence that once successful novelist Grady Tripp had been working on for years. It was a book that took on an unfocused life of it's own, growing like untended weeds to the extent of including complete genealogical charts of a families horses and fattening itself to an unmanageable weight before finally blowing away in a harbor wind. \\"White Teeth\\" could very well have been that novel.<br /><br />  First time novelist Zadie Smith is nothing if not ambitious, as \\"White Teeth\\" is the type of book where you will come to dread the simple act of a man walking into a grocery store to buy some chips. In the following pages it's quite possible you will be bludgeoned with the history of the currency the customer produces, the unseemly hygenic habits of the cashier, or the love life of the architect who designed the building. If a child so much as glances at a cathedral you can be sure that a complete hagiography will soon follow. Ultimately this type of exhaustive information succeeds only in quelling the natural momentum the story might have gathered under the knife of a more scrupulous self-editor. As it is, \\"White Teeth\\" stands as one of the least intimate books I've read, at times being more of a pyrotechnic display of Smith's obsession with her own cleverness than an actual story of believable flesh and blood characters.  I'm assuming that with the advance she apparently recieved, editors were too cowed to actually change anything, and the book's the worse for it.<br /><br />  Although \\"White Teeth\\" is ultimately frustrating, and in my opinion quite overrated, at times Smith does write beautiful prose (the dialogue is another matter) and it makes you wonder how good this book could have been had she written it when she was a little older, didn't have quite so much time on her hands, and tired of constantly reaching for strange \\"teeth\\" analogies.
B00005JL1C|5.0|Back in 1987,my daughter had seen this movie..& advise me to see it.Well..I wasn't really in \\"teen\\" movies..so I went to see it.I loved it.The music in the opening just put you right for the coming story.Producer,John Hughes(from Michigan)was great. <br />But when the beauitful Mary Stuart Masterson came on the scene..it was nothing short of PURE Lovlyness.From that moment on...she had my heart locked up..& still does.Eric Stoltz was great taking out Lea Thompson..only to really fall for Ms.Masterson.I wish movies could come back again this way.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Well first off I should mention that The Mars Volta is probably my favorite band since Jane's Addiction. So yes my opinion is biased.  <br /> <br />This album is basically like one long track. You can seperate them out by hitting the \\"next\\" button on your cd player. But all the noise and music does flow into each song. Something I don't think alot of people know about these guys is that they wanted to do the same thing with \\"De-loused\\" in making it one long song but Universal wouldn't let them at the time. I guess this time around they got the creative freedom they desired. They're a selfish band that makes music that THEY want to hear. Which is why even \\"The Widow\\" had to be cut in half from the album version to make it a single. <br /> <br />The first 3 songs on the album are very much like what was on Deloused. Pretty much to the point with all kinds of tempo changes and time changes. The last two are basically like a salsa/rock/punk/jazz jam session. <br /> <br />Its a great cd and $6.99 at some other retail outlets. <br /> <br />PS there is also one more song called \\"Frances The Mute\\" that was released as a single. It doesn't appear on the album (kind of like Houses Of The Holy not being on the same album by Zep).. but it does complete the album so check that out as well.
B0000029GA|5.0|That's all I have to say.  Best hip hop album ever to be produced, best Nas's has ever done, even over the lost tapes collaboration, and It Was Written.  This was Nas at his finest.  He was so hungry on the mic. He has been getting props from all over from past to present on this album, and had the underground sound and word play which got the real hip hop heads crazy.  This had all the magic.  The great beats and cuts by the great Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip before he fell off, and Large Professor.  Not one track that needed to be skipped over.  The only complaint that I had was that it was too short, 9 actual tracks no including the intro.  But hey, they say it's short but sweet.  If you like real hip hop, you need to get this.  Best all time album.  And the two featured guests are a young AZ (when he had the hunger), and Nas's father jamming in the background on Life's a B**ch.  (I'm not going to attemp to spell his name, I never get it right.)  And it had a Michael Jackson sample on It Aint Hard to Tell, which is song 10.  The old MJ ish.  Get this.  This is hip hop at it's best.
B00006FR47|2.0|Beginnings? Hardly. This album was to signal a detour for the once and former cutting-edge group called 'Chicago' nee 'The Chicago Transit Authority'. A suttle change to some, for the better to others...that they went on to satisfy another audience is well and good but circa Chicago V and thereafter their quite singular and originality-tinged magic was lost forever (and rather quickly), at least in any superlative sense as had been indicated by their first three studio releases. Perhaps 'twas just that others passed them by, though if you are a fan of the post '71 and latter-day incarnations then enjoy this you likely will. If not, shed a tear and remember an earlier time - and 'make me smile'. Personal opinion? To be sure, yet shared by many fans and formers. Was it record company edict? Personal choice? Or perhaps boredom and circumstance? Irregardless, a demarcation clearly took place...truth be told, even before Terry Kath's demise a bit later and with it Chicago's resultant and quite precipitous fall, the band was already a tired sounding and sad caricature of its former self, morphing toward their future in pablum ballad-land. <br /> <br />Not satisfied with quick-death but content to linger and wallow in musical-mediocrity (albeit dollar making mass-superiority), the past 30 plus years to date in this once devoted (since 'only the beginning') CTA and early Chicago fan's/reviewer's opinion has been nothing less. Hey guys, maybe a couple more hits 'compilations' to go with the other 65 ad nauseam already out there will bring some back into the fold, huh? A new release is in the offing I hear...to expect the clock to be magically turned back to the former halcion days is unrealistic from these now (predominantly) 60 something guys, although the similarly dinosauric-age out here like myself still embrace such. Considering the equally decrepit and barren musical landscape circa 2005 that is still ever decaying, it probably wouldn't make any difference. Hopefully the new release is better than the unreleased SOS album of the early 90's, which despite bootleg fans claims is NOTHING on par with the early creations but (again) merely simple caricature. <br /> <br />Onward and backward then, let's revisit Chicago V. As a mid- teenager in 1972 and on current listen again as we speak, I searched for that early rough-cut 'CTA/Chicago' sound - it is not to be found. True enough, 'A Hit By Varese' explodes out of the chute at #1, 'Now That You've Gone' presently and the big commercial hit 'Saturday In The Park' is also here, as well 'Dialouge' (parts I & II) and the rest, but it's all a little too polished (and yes, I saw Chicago many times in the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's.) <br /> <br />With the 60's in retreat by the time of this release perhaps so too was the incredible energy, spontaniety and any way of ever getting back musically...which is to say advance to decline,  progress being replaced by mere perseverance. First Terry Kath, then Peter Cetera and finally Danny Seraphine - with their departures the 'heart and soul' of Chicago was no more. A former band member once suppossedly said Chicago could sh*t on a record and sell a million copies. Not today, and not for many years before now have they sold me...
B0001UL7RY|1.0|You want a genuine teen angst album...listen to Twisted Sister's Under the Blade, You Can't Stop Rock n Roll, or Stay Hungry albums.  Thats rock n roll and most people seem to have forgotten what that is, and believe me...Avril Lavigne is definatly not Rock n Roll.  Dee Snider would eat her dead...
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Tom Cruise plays heartless killer who blames abusive, alcoholic, presumably Irish father for his pathology. Sob. Jamie Foxx plays virtuous black cab driver who speaks fluent english and knows and actually employs shortcuts. Foxx is cabletied to steering wheel and seeks assistance of group of youths who proceed to rob him...they are white, and the setting is Los Angeles. Uh-huh. White cops are dismissive and uncaring, leaving lone Hispanic cop to piece together Cruise's modus operandi. Not a bad action flick aside from the PC (...), but I'd imagine most people would prefer something that respects its audience's intelligence a little more, regardless of race, color or creed.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I started to really get into music with Spanish influences a while ago. A friend got me into The Mars Volta and they've just been a completely amazing group that gets better and better. Frances The Mute is a masterpiece of music. It blends Spanish and psychadellic music to make this phenomenon that I cannot stop listening to. I can't say that this is better than their other music because it's all so different and wonderful. I highly recommend this CD to ANYONE who appreciates fine musicianship. This album will blow you away. <br /> <br />~AmbulanceX

B0006M4SO6|5.0|i'm a long time metheny fan...i listened to this cd and to be honest it wasn't as acessible to me as some of his earlier recordings...and then i had the pleasure of hearing it last night live in oakland california...all i can say is if you have a chance to see them perform this live-do it...this is one of the few times in my long time concert experience that the live performance was far superior to the recorded version...they put on an absolutely fantastic show...enough said!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I write this as a devoted fan of both the O'Brian novels and of great filmmaking.    Master and Commander is an extraordinary piece of work - a tribute to the vision of the director, the skill of the actors, and the brilliance of the screenwriters.    Nothing is perfect here.  There are some annoying technical errors - the Surprise sailing quickly with her sails essentially backed, for example (non-sailors won't see it, but it will rankle those who know sail).  Paul Bettany, who gives a marvelous performance as Steven Maturin, is just too damned pretty to play O'Brian's prickly surgeon/spy.  It's a concession to Hollywood, I suppose.    This may prove to be the finest performance of Russell Crowe's career.  Crowe has always impressed me with the upper end of his range, but he's never impressed me with the incredible subtlety he displays here; the level of detail in his work here is mindblowing.  He IS Jack Aubrey, who may be one of the most intriguing characters in modern literature.  Aubrey's compassion, hubris, arrogance, passion and sensitivity are positively nailed in Master and Commmander.    Now, a word on the writing.  O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin tales are too complex to be rendered on film - think Lord of the Rings, five times over.  So instead, Peter Weir chose to crystallize the  essence of the O'Brian books into one movie.  He and co-writer John Collee succeded beyond hope.  The movie takes its primary guidance from two of O'Brian's books but grabs snippets from all of them - and comes up with gold.  There are visual throwaways throughout - this is as reverential and, in its way, faithful a screenplay as I can think of, and it manages to be so despite the fact that the source material is a challenging and daunting read.    This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  Small-minded O'Brian fans may feel cheated by some of the shorthand; there are some technical and continuity errors; people who believe that movies should contain romance will feel cheated; those who look for continuous slam-bang action will get bored and if one really wanted to parse one could probably find lots of other things wrong with it - considering what passes for great movies nowadays (I confess I read a number of the one-star reviews here and just shook my head - this ain't Star Wars, folks - there's a real story here).    So be it.  Look for a thumping wonderful yarn, real emotion, an impressive presentation on the hardships of life at sea in the 19th century, great writing and above all, incredible performances from everyone in the cast.      This is an amazing piece of work.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Finally a guitar group that not only sounds great but has mastered the ability to put together a great album matched with soulful empassioned lyrics. Interpol is as in touch with the past as they are with today's new alternative pop... So strong is this correlation that you cannot deny hearing the eary cry of the late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis in songs like Obstacle 1 and PDA. ...But that's where the similarity ends and Interpol begins. In short, Interpol reminds us of the early, honest days of alternative music intrepreted through the cynicism and desperation of today. \\"Yours is the only version of my desertion that I could ever subscribe to.. that is all that I can do\\" (PDA) -Interpol
140004281X|5.0|\\"Runaway\\" is a compilation of short stories that can be very sad, I'll say that up front.  There wasn't a happy ending in the bunch.  Still, Alice Munrow captures the souls of the women in her stories, truly revealing their vulnerability, their hearts laid bare.  As she does this, she seems to get inside your thoughts and makes you look closer at your own life.<br />\\"Tricks\\", the most notable story, still occupies space in my mind..  It's a story of a chance meeting, hope, anticipations, despair, and then possibly, understanding.  All this takes place between just a few short pages which I find amazing.<br /><br /> I think this book is about discovering yourself.  Alice Munrow has a knack for making you look deep inside yourself and ask some hard questions AND she does it while entertaining you. I highly recommend \\"Runaway\\" if you're the type to stay put and take at look at your own life.

B00000099Y|5.0|If any metal album contained within this entire metal library deserves 5 stars then it is this one.  Tool is not a band that is going to appeal to all audiences, but what they do, they do brilliantly and this is perhaps their strongest showcase.  It is no wonder than many people looking to fine tune their hi-fi stereo systems for metal music use this album.  Not only is the production top notch but the musicianship and songwriting are above anything else I could think to recommend in this genre.  Some people have complained about the lyrics on this album.  I personally them to be a perfectly suited to the music and a compliment to songwriting in general.

B0007N1AI6|5.0|I'm amused when I read reviews from people who claim to be 'old-school' JP fans, and then they say 'from the 80s'. Well, I am an old fan from the Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny and Sin After Sin days - now THOSE were masterpieces!<br /><br />I quit listening to JP when I heard 'Breakin the Law' - I felt that a once-great heavy metal band had sold out to pop mtv.<br /><br />So disenchanted was I that I didn't even bother to listen to their later albums, some of which, I hear, were actually good.<br /><br />Well, I was excited about their reunion, and bought Angel of Retribution the day it came out. Dared I hope that they would not pull a Metallica and try to copy the current 'trendy' sound?<br /><br />Thankfully, I was NOT disappointed! They have masterful musicianship, and manage to sound as heavy or heavier than any of that growly crap that is so trendy. They have proven that you don't have to growl to sound heavy!<br /><br />Loch Ness is a masterpiece - majestic, epic. Slightly reminiscent of Mountain's 'Nantucket Sleighride' for all you old-timers out there. My 16-year-old son has never liked Halford's voice (sacrilige!!!) and he LOVES 'Judas Rising'. And my favorite? 'Angel' - just exquisite! Profound and deep! The best lyrics of any song on the album.<br /><br />All the songs are great. A couple are more commercially accessable, without being predictable or pop, and the rest are not commercial at all. Yea!<br /><br />I won't quite say I am blown away, but hey, I'm pretty damn picky. Sad Wings will probably always be my fav JP album, but I am just absolutely thrilled at how great Angel of Retribution is! It's AT LEAST as good as Resurrection and Crucible, and maybe better!

They meet with riders of Rohan that where banded from the city by Wormtoung a survant of Saruman the White. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas learn that these riders destroyed the Urak-hia but did not notice the hobbits. They continue to find the remains of the Urah-kai in hopes of finding the two hobbits. Aragorn uses his leadership skills and found traces of the two hobbits that lead them into Fangorn Forest. The three travelers went warrily into the old dark forest.<br /><br />In the forest they meet up with a wizard assuming he was Sarumon, and attempted to attack him.

Treebeard sees that the white wizard has torn down several of his trees, and is greatly disturbed by this. He calls the other ents and wakens the trees and attacks Isengard. <br />  <br />Frodo and Sam finally meat Gollum, and to Sams dislike Frodo orders Gollum to lead them to Mordor. Sam never trusts Gollum, who later plots to kill both him and Frodo to take the ring back as his own. On the way to Mordor the cross a swamp land called the dead marshes. They then go through a forest and meet the captin of Ithilien another son of the stuard of Gondor, Faramir. He attemps to take the ring to save Gondor but realizes that the ring does no good. He realizes Sam, Frodo, and Gollum and they continue to Mordor. <br /> <br />It has all of the same stars as the Fellowship also stars new characters: <br />Bernard Hill as King Theoden, Brad Dourif as Wormtounge, Maranda Otto as Eoywen, David Wenham as Faramir, and Karl Urban as Eomar.
B0007P3582|5.0|He has hot joints on this album..you wont be dissapointed trust me..
B0007P3582|4.0|The Massacre, 50's album following the success of his first major album, Get Rich or Die Trying, hits the spot but leaves definite room for improvement. Track by track rating: <br /> <br />2. In My Hood (4/5)- good beat, the same old lyrics though. Just another gangsta track. <br />3. This is 50 (4/5)- Black Jeruz and Sha Money XL deliver a sick beat. Nice chorus too. <br />4. I'm Supposed to Die Tonight (5/5)- Eminem is coming around as a producer just as much as 50 is not coming around as a lyricist. <br />5. Piggy Bank (3/5)- The Fat Joe, Jadakiss, and Nas diss. I doubt Nas will respond but Jada and Fat Joe are going to tear 50 to pieces after this. It's a good song, but once again same old crap lyrics. <br />6. Gatman and Robin (5/5)- Eminem is on this track and he and 50 ride the beat like a wave. Another hot production from Eminem. <br />7. Candy Shop (3/5)- Very similar to the Magic Stick track from yesteryear. Olivia has a nice voice, kinda of like Ashanti *cough* *cough* <br />8. Outta Control (4/5)- Club joint with a sick beat from Dr. Dre. <br />9. Get In My Car (4/5)- Hi-Tek on the beat is grand. 50 does his part. Another hot chorus. <br />10. Ski Mask Way (5/5)- One of my favorite tracks. Just hot.  <br />11. A Baltimore Love Thing (5/5)- 50's most excellent lyrically. He compares himself to a drug, pretty deep metaphor for commercial rap. <br />12. Ryder Music (3/5)- 50 rapping with such a calm voice just comes off as lazy. <br />13. Disco Inferno (2/5)- Too commercial for me. Even more mind numbing than In Da Club. <br />14. Just A Lil Bit (5/5)- The beat alone from Scott Storch scores a 5 out of 5.  <br />15. Guns Come Out (5/5)- 2nd best track on the album. Dr. Dre and 50, I hope this combo doesn't fall apart over this Game beef. <br />16. My Toy Soldier (2/5)- Weak beat from Eminem but 50 and Yayo better here together than they normally do. <br />17. Position of Power (4/5)- Monotonous yet straight up gangsta. It's bumping in my car. <br />18. Build You Up (1/5)- 50 dissed Ja Rule for making songs like this and then he turns around and makes his own. <br />19. God Gave Me Style (2/5)- blah. blah. blah. <br />20. So Amazing (4/5)- Olivia sounds great on this track. <br />21. I Don't Need Em (4/5)- sick beat and 50 grinds it perfectly. <br />22. Hate It Or Love It Remix(5/5)- Game is no longer part of G-Unit so this will probably the last time he and 50 will be caught on the same track. Lloyd Banks is sick. Oh my god, Banks could take on any rapper right now. Young Buck drops a great verse and Tony Yayo drops a verse above his average too. <br /> <br />Regarding the beef between Game and 50: it's going to get real ugly real fast. Someone already got shot.
0062502182|4.0|The second read through this book.  I enjoyed it just as much as the first time!  Good story, interesting philosophy and intriguing Biblical allusions. <br /> <br />This work appeals to me on many levels.  Certainly I enjoy the adventures of the boy's life.  I find myself more of the man in the crystal shop dreaming of adventure, rather than living the dream.  But perhaps this the greater appeal of the book itself.  One is able to see themselves in many ways, whether it be strengths or faults, throughout the course of the adventure unfolding.  The book is full of quotes and ideas that cause one to stop and ponder for a moment (or at times longer).  The reader is drawn in by the idea of simple complexity.  The twist at the end even brings a smile to my face as I read it, simply delightful. <br /> <br />As much as I enjoyed this work, I still find it second to another Paulo Coelho work titled \\"The Fifth Mountain.\\"  I love Biblical fiction that portrays Biblical figures as real people (as such that they were).  \\"The Alchemist\\" has several such musings of the author on Biblical people.  This was my only complaint, if it can be counted as such, that those allusions were too few! <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more from this author and would highly suggest it, giving it four out of five stars!
1400043662|5.0|This author is such a beautiful story teller, and he develops his characters so well, that when you finish the book, you miss them.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|there's obviously plenty of good, long reviews here. i'll just say that i caught most of this on pbs (why? i don't know, but it was on tv, i swear) one summer when i was a teenager (it was still a newish movie then), and the flying scenes blew my mind. i couldn't get it out of my head for years! i lived in a small town and didn't have the resources to find out what it was. i ran across the manga ten years later and a bootleg of the film shortly after that. i've been a devoted miyazaki fan since. this movie is beautiful, despite any gripes about massive plot compression (read the manga!), voice dubs (watch the japanese version!) or comparisons to later ghibli films (watch them all!). just watch this movie and it will make you feel good.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|This movie is about a seriel killer that tries to get his victims to kill themselves or someone else. Unique idea, but the story - although not much of one - doesn't hold up. <br /> <br />I won't ruin the ending, but if you ever see it, you'll be a little mad because it ends up making most of the movie nonsensical and preposterous. Instead of making the serial killer into something believable, he ends up being something like a Jason or a Freddie. <br /> <br />Based on how this movie ended, you can almost guarantee they'll be a sequel that I'll be sure to miss.
0393035158|3.0|I had a difficult time with this book. The argument for the removal of religion as a guide for behavior was well stated, and while I agree with Harris' thesis of the danger of pre-19th century mythology in a world awash in 21st century weaponry, I can't help but think that the validity and importance of his main issue (the danger of belief) is clouded by his embrace of reason as a method of solving all of our problems. I found it Ironic that Harris did not see the obvious contradition in his condemnation of the Inquisition and his sanction and subsequent rationalization for torture (the ticking time bomb fallacy) in the \\"war on terror\\". This reasoning is dangerous and counterproductive. I read this book in conjunction with John Ralston Saul's \\"On Equilibrium\\" and found Saul's argument against the pure use of reason (and the reasons for it) evident in Harris' own theses.The attempts at finding spiritual balance (the last section of the book) also failed to convey the sense of humanist spiritualism that Saul eloquently illustrates. I highly suggest \\"On Equilibirum\\" as a companion (and perhaps) as an antidote to some of Harris' more shocking and anti-humanist rhetoric. I believe that while the danger of ancient mythology as ideology (fundamantalist religion) is likely to mean the end of human civilization, it can only be matched (or outdone) by the dangerous (il)logic of pure reason. Only by finding a balance in the nature of our universe (scientific truth) and the humanist ideal can we hope to survive as a species.
B000000H66|5.0|Amazing Progressive Death Metal album, every song on here is mind boggling and will provied many hours of listening pleasure. Death's best album in my opinion. If you like this, you will probably like Pestilence's last disc, Cynic, and Disincarnate.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The second the movie was over, I was dumbstruck, and I wasn't the only one. When the movie ended I thought there would be a big round of applause but when I turned around I saw that about half the audience was still in their seats. I looked at a couple of people, some were speachless and most were crying. Nonetheless I didn't hear a word. When I thought about it, i realized an applause would have been ridiculous. <br /> <br />When someone asked me how the movie was I was going to say it was amazing, but that wouldn't have done the movie justice. The movie was an extremely moving, emotional experience. <br /> <br />The cast was absolutely flawless, Jim Caviezel gave a powerful performance as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern as Mary brought me to tears, and even though Monica Bellucci spoke only a few lines, her performance and beauty astonished me. The score was incredible. It had a middle-eastern feel to it, and was timeless and beautiful. <br /> <br />Most aspects of the movie were perfect to me. Instead of a squeaky clean version of the life of Jesus it was a realistic and heartbreaking portrayal of his final hours. The Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew languages, and wonderful cinematography made you really feel like you were in first century Jerusalem. The flashbacks truly had an emotional impact on me. <br /> <br />While watching this movie I forgot about everything else in the world. Mel Gibson did an incredible job as a director and he truly was brave for taking on this project despite all the controversy. <br /> <br />As for the two main concerns of most people, the ultra-violence, and the alleged anti-semetism these are my views on the two. <br /> <br />Everything people are saying about the violence is true. It is brutal, gory, and quite possibly the most violent work in cinematic history. This R-Rating is very well justified and an NC-17 would have made sense. If you are the type of person that cannot bear violence, this is definately not the movie for you. Some scenes oftorture last about 10 minutes when you feel you've seen enough after 30 seconds. But, the violence I feel was absolutely necessary. The movie is about the suffering/passion of Jesus, and turning the camera away would not have an impact on you. The movie shows what Jesus actually went through for all of mankind's sins (according to Christianity). Mel Gibson did not exagerate the violence or make it look like horror movie or Kill Bill violence. As Jay Leno said on his show the other night, when Jesus was hit it felt like WE were being hit as opposed to other violent movies were you feel like YOU are the one hitting the person. I don't think anyone can say that every single hit upon Jesus didn't affect him/her somehow. <br /> <br />As for the anti-semetism in the movie, I didn't find it was as bad as everyone is making it out to be. The thing that made me see why people were criticizing Mel Gibson for was that instead of spreading the blame somewhat on the Jewish high priests (Sanhedrin) and mostly on Pilate, 99% of the blame was put on the Sanhedrin, which seemed false to me considering that historically it is known that Pilate was a vicious monster, and in the movie he seems like a gentle person and reluctant to crucify Jesus. I simply didn't buy the fact that Pilate would be so nice. The movie can be considered anti-first-century-Romans, and anti-Sanhedrin, but I did not feel the movie was attacking the Jewish religion, or the entire Jewish people. But the movie is not anti-semitic for these reasons: 1. It is made evident that it was Jesus' prophecy and destiny is to die. He could probably have escaped from Gethsemane or even the cross (if he truly had ''powers''). He was born to die, and there is no blame to be placed on anyone. If anything, the Romans of that time are portrayed horribly (though realistically), and they are the ones that made him suffer tremendously before his death. 2. Basically all the ''Good Guys'' in the movie are Jewish. Jesus himself was a Jew, Mary was, The man that helped Jesus carry the cross was Jewish, Veronica the woman that brought Jesus water and wiped his face was, and many Jews were screaming in the crowd against the torture and crucifixion of Jesus. (Personally, I don't know why Pilate was portrayed so nicely. It's not like the Jews had the ultimate power. It was ultimately HIS decision to have Jesus crucified.) <br /> <br />An aspect of the film that intrigued me was the character of Satan, and the demons in the movie. When I first found out Satan was in the movie, I was scared it would be a red man with horns and a pitchfork, but he/she is portrayed subtly. Everything about him/her was very Eerie. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for making this film. He made the movie the way HE thought it was and though most historians or even religious figures would not agree completely to what happened, it is a general idea as to what those final hours were. When reading the new testament or hearing the story of Jesus, it's hard to understand what it was actually like for Jesus to go through all that pain, and what it was like for Mary to watch her son get tortured and crucified. The movie really put things in perspective for me. <br /> <br />Some people are criticizing him for adding things never written in the gospels such as demons harassing Judas Iscariot, most scenes with Satan, and the torture from Gethsemene to the Jewish court, but he had to fill the blanks in the Gospels with what he thought might have happened. <br /> <br />In conclusion, not everyone will like this movie. Some will love it, and some will hate it. But, I think that if you can endure the extreme violence and torture you should at least see it before you judge it. My opinion: 10/10  <br /> <br />
B00005J6SZ|1.0|The songs of Like A Virgin and Material Girl are the only worth listening songs here, the rest of the album is pure filler.  No wonder she promoted by the VIRGIN years two tracks that were not on the album, such as the superior dance song INTO THE GROOVE and the melting sweet ballad CRAZY FOR YOU, LIKE A VIRGIN  produced by CHIC crooner Nile Rodgers falls so far behind from his clever years with the DISCO act...fact is that Madonna dislikes MATERIAL GIRL, and LIKE A VIRGIN sounds classic but extremely overplayed. So IF you're plannning to start your Madonna collection with this(Cos it sold more than 10 million records in the US alone), you are truly misinformed and will end up not listening to this, buy the DEBUT stand out album, is more street more real.
0783227434|4.0|Props to Sam Raimi for making a film that defies the typical conventions of horror. As he did for the last two Evil Dead films (even though the second was a higher budget remake of the first) he was poking fun at the horror genre. Moreover, let's face it, there's a lot to be made fun of. <br /> <br />When I read the plot description, I was certain that this film would be disastrous. Ash, going back in time, to the Middle Ages nonetheless, to help King Arthur win a battle against the \\"army of the dead\\". It was preposterous. Yet somehow, he pulled it off. The same irreverent wit that fueled the low budget first film, and the slightly higher budget second film, was in full display here. In addition, I understood why horror buffs are interested in an Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason film. Actually, the only reason I watched Evil Dead was to understand why Ash would play a pivotal role if that film was ever made. Now I know. And I hope that they make it - and I hope that someone talented writes the script and directs it. Freddy vs. Jason was a complete disaster. <br /> <br />Nothing about this film made sense, and that was the brilliance of it. Where did Ash come up with a Chemistry 101 textbook that taught him how to make gunpowder? How was he able to escape the first Necromonicon book when it sucked him in with (apparently) the force of a tornado? And how was Ash capable of teaching many of Arthur's knights how to \\"really\\" fight? Seriously - this may have been the Middle Ages, but these guys knew how to handle a halberd, and knew how to handle it better than Ash. <br /> <br />But that was the brilliance of the film. It poked fun at just about everything, and when it wasn't poking fun it was paying homage. When Henry the Red's forces aligned at the top of a hilltop to fall upon the Army of Darkness, that was straight out of The Lord of the Rings. And I'm not talking about the movie, which was made almost a decade later. I'm talking about the book, which was written thirty yearsprior. However, that's not a criticism. It's part of a hysterical script that was not supposed to be taken seriously. Horror films fall into two categories: those that are meant to be taken seriously, and those that poke fun at themselves. Army of Darkness fell into the latter, and did a marvelous job. I found myself laughing aloud at *several* points. It was ingenious. <br /> <br />Even non-horror buffs would find this amusing. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Most brilliant collection of music to have ever graced my ears... it has so much feeling and emotion to it, I just cant get enough. I didn't think it was possible for them to top Deloused in the Comatorium, but they have surpased any boundaries of music if there ever were any. They are the best sounds of Pink Floyd, Queen, and maybe even Yes. These guys are the most talented band to hit the music scene in a long time. This band is what we need to bring REAL rock back into the picture. This album exists within a whole new dimension. This album definately has a beautiful unique sound to it. Best album ever. Ever.
B0002NRRAG|3.0|I listened to Mademoiselle Peyroux's album three times yesterday. I think it is generally a pleasant album and it is vastly superior the latest efforts of that Sinatra-wannabe, Michael Bubl&eacute;!<br /><br />The selection of songs is quite interesting and the accompaniment from her ensemble of musicians is tasteful and appropriate. However, this is not an album that explores the depths of the human soul. It would, however, make for very pleasant light-listening on a lazy Sunday afternoon or make quite stylish dinner party music.<br /><br />Ms Peyroux's vocal sounds rather derivative to me. She is clearly a fresh young woman and yet, she sounds a little like an old lady on this recording! An old lady trying to sound like Billie Holiday!<br /><br />I just wish that Ms Peyroux's conspicuous fascination with Billie Holiday was quite so darn obvious as it is on this recording.<br /><br />However, as I said, this is a pleasant recording that doesn't bother me in any major way - even after several listens. Lovers of Jazz and Jazz-styled voices shouldn't hesitate to give this CD a go!
068987474X|4.0|I first heard about this book on TV and found the idea intriguing, perhaps it would even be informative.  After all, we women sometimes need all the encouragement we can get.  Even more, we need someone to help us understand men and what their mixed signals can mean. <br /> <br />Mostly, from what Greg Behrendt, the male of the team, says, mixed signals mean \\"he's just not that into you.\\"  But what about compromise, getting to know one another, giving a little, taking a little?  Nope.  There's no encouragement here for the woman hoping to find true love and a long lasting relationship.  It's easier to hope that Greg is looking at the negative side of things and is blinded to the possibilities. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Liz Tuccillo expresses what most of us have felt or hoped when confronted by a man who's never there for us, or is loving one moment, cold the next.  Surely, if we are patient and loving, he will realize what a wonderful catch I am and everything will end happily ever after. <br /> <br />Greg tells the reader often that he's found the woman of his dreams, and that even he treated women ambiguously before that.  Does that mean there is still hope for the rest of us women, that one day the right man will come along?  Given the negativism of the bulk of this book, it's almost impossible to believe. <br /> <br />This book can give some insight into the minds of men who are giving us signals we can't read.  But taking the whole as the entire truth, may be self defeating.  Surely there is a middle ground, between what the man says and what we hope for.  Otherwise, we might be too tempted to either settle or just give up.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Before Disney started releasing absurd movies that justifiably performed poorly at the box office such as \\"Brother Bear\\" and \\"Home on the Range,\\" and the ridiculous \\"Teacher's Pet,\\" which couldn't even hit $10 million, they stuck to what they were best at -- taking classic children's stories and making them into grand animated movie musicals. People speak with their wallets, and the animated musicals mostly hit $150 million and above. Now, with the era of computer animation hitting it's peak, mediocrity (compared to films such as The Little Mermaid) such as the vastly overrated \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\" flourishes. <br /> <br />But we can be nostalgic, right? <br /> <br />My parents brought me to and then bought me all of these classic Disney movie musicals. My first Disney movie in theaters was \\"Aladdin\\" in 1993, when I was three years old. My first on video was this, The Little Mermaid, which my mom had bought previously. I've still watched it multiple times every year since I've had it. And it will weather the test of time far more than movies like \\"Finding Nemo.\\" <br /> <br />The musical numbers are superb. \\"Kiss the Girl\\" and \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\" are probably the best of them (Sorry, \\"Under the Sea\\" purists, it's just not workin' for me here!), for they have the most theatrical feel. The wickedness oozes out of Ursula, who is easily the most sinister of any Disney villain, during the latter. The former is Sebastian, Ariel the Mermaid's little crustacion sidekick, rallying the sea creatures to push Ariel and Prince Eric to kiss, for only if they kiss in three days can Ariel regain her voice she gave up through her pact with Ursula to become human. It's almost good enough to be called, dare I say, intense? <br /> <br />The tweaks to the story are top-notch. It flows perfectly enough without any confusion for the little ones and with enough emotion for the older crowd. The voices serve each character perfectly and the length is perfect for a quick movie (around an hour and a half). Of course, though, the highlight of the movie is the fabulous music. <br /> <br />So before Disney resorted to fart jokes, they had films such as this. Parents, if your kids were born past 1995, they almost certainly are missing out on the musicals of Disney's golden age, 1988-1994, where they cranked out classic after classic. Who am I to talk? I'm a fifteen year old guy who loves great movies of all kinds, and Disney's old movies are certainly that. <br /> <br />- 3/5/05
B0002UOK04|5.0|If you know Ensiferum you know the guy that broke off and formed Wintersun.  That said, if you are not a big fan of Ensiferum do not automatically turn a blind eye to this release.  This is different from Ensiferum.  More Celestial and less Viking.  That said, this smokes both Ensiferum releases to ashes.  Much faster and the production is so clear and powerful it makes your jaw drop almost immediately.  I have been listening to metal for 22 years and I can tell you this still blew me on my ---.  I cannot believe how spellbinding and unbelievable this release is.  You see so many reviews on Amazon that have 5 stars that it no longer means anything so let me just paint you a picture.<br /><br />Style wise I think the best picture I can give you is this.  Think of releases such as:<br /><br />Norther - Dreams Of Endless War<br /><br />Skyfire - Mind Revolution<br /><br />Skyfire - Spectral<br /><br />COB - Any<br /><br />Now, I am not a huge COB fan but the Norther and Skyfire releases I listed are favorites of mine.  That said I can tell you straight up that this Wintersun release easily kicks the crud out of all of them.  So if you are interested at all in this style of metal Wintersun is simply the top release in the genre and it is not even close.<br /><br />M the P
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is 1 of the rare R&B albums of Gen X and Y that soothes the soul, instead of getting us \\"CRUNK\\" throughout the entire CD.  Although I feel he channeled Stevie Wonder for the cut Ordinary People, he did a great job on the album.  This CD is going to be talked about all year hopefully.  Unless of course, since most of his music isn't sampled or using every drum machine and synthesizer known to man AND he writes his own damnded music, this CD probably won't be appreciated like it should be I.E. Jill Scott, Faith Evans, Kelly Price, all of whom write their own material.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Like many people, I bought the Franz Ferdinand album on the strength of the first single, Take Me Out. This despite the fact that I have been routinely disappointed in the past with albums by other bands (that shall remain nameless) consisting of a strong single and eight or ten throwaway songs along with some arch liner note material and garish artwork to distract from the sub-par music. <br /> <br />Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by the strength of this record. That's not to say that there isn't some mod-ish liner note material included here (there is), but for once it's nice to see that an equal amount of care and focus has gone into crafting songs that you actually can bear listening to. <br /> <br />What I probably like most about Franz Ferdinand is the way that their songs seem to be assembled with a sense of balance that's pretty rare to see these days. No guitar solos or self-indulgent lyrical forays to overwhelm the listener; only a tight harmony among all band members and a straight-ahead style that engages rather than overpowers. This is a band in the true sense of the word, rather than a collection of supporting players built around a singer or guitarist. <br /> <br />And for those who like to listen to a CD right through, Tell Her Tonight / Take Me Out / The Dark of the Matinee form the best set of back-to-back-to-back songs you're liable to find anywhere. <br /> <br />Happy listening.
0783114893|5.0|Some call the original Hitcher a horror movie, others classify it under the suspense genre, etc.  All that aside, this little flick did more than turn a few heads back when it came out in the mid-80's, featuring Rutger Hauer's ice cold performance as a psychotic killer who hitches a ride with a young man (C. Thomas Howell) whom he terrorizes and frames for his crimes as the film rolls on.  Considering the time the Hitcher was made, it's surprisingly not predictable, and loaded with taut suspense, with great performances from Howell, Jennifer Jason Leigh (whose character has the most infamous death in the whole film), and especially Hauer who is disturbingly perfect as psychopathic killer John Ryder.  Hopefully the Hitcher will be re-released on DVD with loads of features and a much better picture transfer (the one on this disc is terribly grainy), and considering all the DVD double dipping of late, that possibility isn't entirely unlikely.
B000002L9J|5.0|First, a disclaimer: <br /> <br />I can't presume to place The Queen Is Dead in some carefully thought-out position among the all-time great albums by British bands, let alone in some rank-ordered slot of the best Smiths material. <br /> <br />Having said that, the genius of this record for me is its easy scope and ambitious range. There's something worthwhile to suit most tastes: darkly brooding melancholia (this is Morrissey, after all) on I Know It's Over; reggae-tinged dancehall on Frankly, Mr. Shankly; lighter, breezier pop inflections on Cemetry Gates; sheer marginalia to bring the listener some appreciated levity on Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others. <br /> <br />And throughout, Morrissey's lyrics, far from detracting from the impressive musicianship, help to put a finer point on each song and lend the record a sometimes uncomfortable sense of urgency. This immediacy extends easily from self-directed vitriol (\\"If you're so very entertaining / Why do you sleep alone tonight\\") to the castigation of artless hacks (\\"If you must compose prose and poems / The words you use should be your own / Don't plagiarise or take on loan\\") to the suffocating presence of the monarchy (\\"Her very Lowness with her head in a sling / I'm truly sorry / But it sounds like a wonderful thing\\"). <br /> <br />This is a fantastically crafted collection of songs, and as an compelling an introduction to this band as one could hope for.
B000005RSW|5.0|this in my view is one of the best EVER, it is awesome from start to finnish, a diamond in the rough and a little known classic, manowar rule, period, but they oudo themselves here, this IS AWESOME, BUY!!!!, i mean no insult to the reviewer, from one brother of metal to the other, i just disagree, fight on, hail
B0002858YS|5.0|When their first single \\"Somebody Told me\\" first reached the radio, my first reaction was that they were just another mainstream rock band in the crowd, nothing original. I was very wrong in thinking that! Something about the Killers...when their music grows on you, it really stays. The more i listened to their second single, \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" I fell in love with the beat with that tune.  Then, when I bought their CD, i finally got what their music is all about:    1. Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine -Just the beginning of what this cd is all about. Brandon's \\"oh oh ohs\\" sound really energetic, making you appreciate his interesting vocals.    2. Mr. Brightside -For some reason, this song gives me the overwhelming urge to dance and spin around. I really can't get sick of listening to it eitheir.      3. Smile Like You Mean It - I love the lyrics, I love the beat. I can listen to this song on repeat and not get sick of it. Nothing bad about this at all. One of the best on here.    4. Somebody Told Me -alright. Perhaps overplayed like Mr. Brightside, but blame the radio for that. Nonetheless, its a catchy fun song.     5. All These Things That I've Done -A stand out from there other tunes. A bit slower. The part where there is a gospel choir singing \\"I got soul but I'm not a soldiar,\\" actually adds in really well, and tends to uplift the song.     6. Andy, You're A Star  -My favorite tune on here. It may be slower as well, but its an interesting song. The guitars are just totally awesome.     7. On Top -Very synth at the beginning. This songs a bit different in lyrics, but I very much loved it. This would be a great one to dance to.     8. Change Your Mind -A pop track, but It's filled with pep, catchy, so it's hard not to like. Sound's very 80's.    9. Believe Me Natalie -Couldn't get this one out of my head, but it didn't really bother me beacuse it's good. If you liked Mr. Brightside, then I think you'll like this one. It also has that dance spinning vibe Mr. Brightside gave you.    10. Midnight Show  -Really cool track here, with a suspense kind of energy to it I can't quite put in words. Awesome synth, and the lyrics are different. Kind of a sort of continuation of Jenny Was a friend of mine.     11. Everything Will Be Alright  -different, softer, but one of my favorites. There is a music box thing going on in here thats extremely pretty, its also a comforting song too though.     What I got from the Killers music is this: . All of their tunes are different from the other. Great sounding synths, guitar, drums, and vocals the whole way through. I cant deny this band has a lot of talent, and the more I listen to them, there not just like everyone else. They are in fact very original. Sure, as i read from other peoples reviews, the lyrics aren't completely amazing, but they do make you think, and Brandon uses his imagination in them, thats for sure. Why I like this cd is because the Killers are very creative, all the songs are good, and there trying something new in music for a change (which everyone truly needs) thats working out very well for them. It will be great to see what The Killers do next.
B00065LY1I|3.0|Alright, I am an average American who didn't know much about Kylie's music except for the Fever album, which I owned, and \\"Slow\\" and \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" which I heard on the radio here in the states, and also \\"Spinning Around\\" which I downloaded about 2 years ago, but that was about it. Yesterday I bought Ultiamte Kylie because I was really interested in her earlier music and i actually found it for pretty cheap! Anyway, I have to say that I am a hardcore Madonna fan, and I know there's been a sort of rivalry between fans of the 2 pop stars, but I din't want to let that affect what i thought about this collection. 33 songs is a lot to take in in 1 day, so I'm basing my review on first impressions upon hearing most of these songs for the very first time. Perhaps some of the songs will grow on me in time. <br />1. \\"Better The Devil You Know\\" Wow, this song caught my attention right away, i think it's FANTASTIC and a great opening to this collection. Very modern disco-ish. 10/10 <br />2. \\"The Loco-Motion\\" sorry, but i just can't get into this one. I feel guilty even listening to it. 2/10 <br />3. \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" ok, this is a cute song, very catchy. It's very 80's but i rather enjoyed it. 8/10 <br />4. \\"Step Back In Time\\" I REALLY like this one, it's a great dance track and very infectious. Very retro/disco/funky. This one along with \\"Better the Devil\\" are my 2 faves on disc 1. 10/10 <br />5. \\"Shocked\\" I like this one too, but the only thing that bugs me is the rap, which is very dated. but anyway, the song has a fantastic beat. A great house track 8/10 <br />6. \\"What Do I Have To Do\\" Another dance track, this one's a little less memorable to me, but it's very listenable. 7/10 <br />7. \\"Wouldn't Change A Thing\\" This one's nice enough, it's not remarkable, but it's good. 7.5/10 <br />8. \\"Hand On Your Heart\\" the beginning reminded me of a Wilson Phillips song. This one's a little too generic for me. 6/10 <br />9. \\"Especially For You\\" The beginning vocalizing is very nice, but as soon as the song actually starts, i start to cringe! I'm sorry, but i can alost swear i heard this song in a Folgers commercial. Can't you just see someone sitting down at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee while the announcer sings \\"especially for youuuu\\"? Can't dig it. 3/10 <br />10. \\"Got To Be Certain\\" another 80's song, they're starting to sound very similar at this point. This one doesn't stand out too much, but it sounds ok. 6.5/10 <br />11. \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" hmmm, not really feeling this one either. it sounds REALLY dated. 5/10 <br />12. \\"Give Me Just A Little More Time\\" I'm not too sure how I feels about this one yet. It's kind of corny, but also kind of enjoyable to listen to at the same time. 7/10 <br />13. \\"Never Too Late\\" yet another 80's song. Again, this one's not too remarkable 6.5/10 <br />14. \\"Tears On My Pillow\\" hmmm, kind of cheesy, but worth a listen every once in a while i guess 6/10 <br />15. \\"Celebration\\" I am sorry but this one is totally karaoke. 100% grade-A cheese. 2/10 <br />16. \\"I Believe In You\\" This one's pretty good. It was kind of strange to me at first, but I'm getting more into it 8/10 <br />17. \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" great track. 9.5/10 <br />18. \\"Love At First Sight\\" i've loved this song ever since i first heard it in 2002. GREAT 10/10 <br />19. \\"Slow\\" it's alright, i still think it sounds like an 80's video game. It's not as great as the songs on FEVER 8/10 <br />20. \\"On A Night Like This\\" this one's ok, it doens'stand out to me too much, but it's enjoyable 7.5/10 <br />21. \\"Spinning Around\\" Another great track, i love it 9.8/10 <br />22. \\"Kids\\" ok, i love Robbie Williams, but this song's not one of my favorites of his, although it's not bad. 6.8/10 <br />23. \\"Confide In Me\\" this one's pretty cool,very mysterious-sounding. great strings, i like it 7.5/10 <br />24.  \\"In Your Eyes\\" another good songs from the great FEVER album 8.5/10 <br />25. \\"Please Stay\\" this one sounds alright, not spectacular but decent 7.8/10 <br />26. \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" i don't think this one's that great, but it's kind of catchy i guess 7/10 <br />27. \\"Giving You Up\\" this one sounds cool. i think this one will grow on me more 7.8/10 <br />28. \\"Chocolate\\" I'm liking this one so far, this seems tobe the better of the BODY LANGUAGE singles 8/10 <br />29. \\"Come Into My World\\" another song i love, not sure about this remix though. 9/10 <br />30. \\"Put Yourself In My Place\\" sounds good. need to listen to it more, but i'm liking it 7/10 <br />31. \\"Did It Again\\" I'm really digging this one. it's cool to have a rock-ish song in between all this disco! 8.5/10 <br />32. \\"Breathe\\" Another one I'm liking. this one's cool 9/10 <br />33. \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow\\" I thought I was going to hate this one but I'm actually really liking it! Very intereting 8/10 <br />so in the end, i'm glad i bought this because i do like Kylie but I wasn't about to go buy all her albums. this is a good collection, some GREAT tracks, some filler. I feel like i know a little bit more about her and what she's all about. i do wish the tracks had been in chronological order so i couldn't gotten more of a sense of her musical evolution because it does seem like she's been through a lot.  <br />Anyway,i'd recommend this.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Blondie is one of those bands where the more you hear their songs on the radio you finally realize, wow, I love everything by them so far. I never grew up in the 80's, but after hearing hits like \\"Heart Of Glass,\\" \\"The Tide Is High,\\" and one of my favorite tunes ever by them \\"Call Me,\\" I took a jump and bought their greatest hits. I'm being honest when I say there isnt a bad song on here. \\"Dreaming\\" is a dreamy song, and \\"Atomic\\" is just plain cool. \\"Rapture\\" really takes you in, and of course, \\"Maria\\" that song is just plain catchy, but not a bad catchy, a good kind. Also, there a bio of the songs inside the cd, hits from the Usa, as well as the Uk. I highly reccommed this cd, Blondie will catch ears of millions for years to come.
B0007O38F8|5.0|the massacre is a mixure of \\"power of the dollar\\" and \\"get rich or die trying\\", this album proves he hasn't lost his street knowledge, and has also shown that he has learn from the rap game, and that he can accomplish more. Every song has a little something for everyone, from the gangster, the hustler, the pimp, and the joker. with 21 songs on this CD he has shown that he can make a full album for the everyone from the hood to the burbs. ofcourse there are some songs that could use some improvement, but listening to this album repeatedly they all fit into together like a glove.
B000002BQK|5.0|To think i bought this album over 5 years ago, and I still find it beautiful each time i hear it. Mariah probably has one of the most beautiful, impressive voices I have ever heard. Butterfly is my favorite Mariah Carey Album though, because it has some of the most inspiring, soulful, and heartfelt tracks you could ever ask for. \\"My all,\\" she sings her heart out on, and her voice just goes right through you. \\"Butterfly\\" is very R&B but completly inspiring. My favorite tune on here thoug would have to be \\"Close My Eyes,\\" which really gets inside your emotions. \\"I still feel like a child when I look at the moon, maybe I grew up a little too soon. Mariah also writes her own songs, and I have to give her credit for that. What this cd offers for you is heartful, soulful, heartpouring emotional tracks. Along with funky, dance r&b hits. This cd was definetly one of the best from the 90's, and is a classic pop album.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This album is in my opinion the best of Slipknot, It has al versions of Slipknot selftitled album (Purity is almost the same as  dispise), some mixes, some demos and comes in a very well disigned digipack. <br /> <br />742617000027 10/10 It's a f**king insane intro. <br />(sic) 10/10 It's the heaviest, has the same base as \\"Slipknot\\" in MFKR, this song is one of my favorite songs <br />Eyeless 10/10 It's a very good song <br />Wait And Bleed 10/10 It's a perfect song with a mix of heavy and soft voice, It's simply perfect <br />Surfacing 10/10 It's a way to get out of the system in which we live F**k it All! <br />Spit It Out 10/10 It a rare song in which want the people of the radio make silence! <br />Tattered And Torn 8/10 It's a rare song with no much injection, but I like it <br />Me Inside 10/10 it's a way to show that life is just to f**king hard!! <br />Liberate 10/10 It's one of the best, its a fully injection of madness to liberate it! <br />Prosthetics 9/10 Its really good but you have to wait like 2 minutes to see the best of the song <br />No Life 9/10 Another song against way of life <br />Diluted 10/10 Another of life: What the hell did I do to deserve all of this! <br />Only One 10/10 a song of MFKR, full of hate, Only one of us walks  away! <br />Scissors 10/10 a song with all!, heavy, soft, fast and slow! <br />Get This 9/10 Fast song, Get it or die! <br />Spit It Out (Hyper Version) 10/10 Same spit it out but faster!! <br />Wait And Bleed (Terry Date Mix) 10/10 really good mix! <br />Interloper(Demo) 9/10 realy good son I rate 9 because the sound quality is not the best (It's a Demo) <br />Despise(Demo) 10/10 almost the same as Purity, It's basically a clip of Purity (young girl) telling a story to the young boy who took care of her while she was buried. He would bring her food in exchange for her telling him extravagant stories. <br />Surfacing (Live) 10/10 it also comes with the hidden track Eeyore (10/10) that is fast and very good song <br /><br />This album if you like metal, have to be in your collection, also if you have the previous version of 14 tracks you need it,it have more tracks and well well designed Digipack,its simply F**KING PERFECT ALBUM. <br /> <br />I'm a MAGGOT and every song of this insane band it's perfect to me, it got a lot of sense and its part of me. Stay SICK MAGGOTS!!
B000000OQF|5.0|This was the first CD I've ever bought that I like almost every <br />song on. This CD is so awesome. Guns N' Roses are typically one <br />of my favorite bands of all time. All of these songs on this album are really great. The weakest songs on this album maybe <br />You're Crazy, and Rocket Queen. But both songs are still really <br />good. Here's how I feel about every track on this great CD.  <br /> <br />1. Welcome to the Jungle: 10/10 This is the best starter album <br />ever. The opening is really great. Axl makes me laugh in this track. Great song.  <br /> <br />2. It's So Easy: 8/10 This song is also good. But the end to me <br />dosen't get boring at all. It's just a good song.  <br /> <br />3. Nightrain: 9/10 One of my favorite songs on this album. Typical heavy metal style with a great opening. The whole song <br />is great.  <br /> <br />4. Out Ta Get Me: 9/10 This is a great rocking song with Axl <br />talking about getting away from the cop.  <br /> <br />5. Mr. Brownstone: 10/10 This is my favorite song on this album. <br />This is one of the best songs ever! The beginning in this song <br />is really great. It should have been on Greatest Hits. <br /> <br />6. Paradise City: 10/10 Yet another awesome song! This one delivers the best rock you'll ever hear. The beginning is really <br />great with Steven at his best.  <br /> <br />7. My Michelle: 8/10 Possibly the heaviest song on the album. <br /> <br />8. Think About You: 8/10 Not much to say on this song but great. <br /> <br />9. Sweet Child O' Mine: 1,000,000/10 Possibly the best song on <br />the entire album, one of GN'R's best songs ever behind November <br />Rain. Slash rules on solo in this song and Axl rules on vocals. <br /> <br />10. You're Crazy: 6/10 Like I said before, this is the weakest <br />song on this album but is still a pretty good song. This song <br />goes fast, maybe too fast. But is a track I'd skip after 2 minutes.  <br /> <br />11. Anything Goes: What the, not much to saybut good. <br /> <br />12. Rocket Queen: This song opens great and goes great til four <br />minutes then gets sadder and sadder. This is the weakest song <br />on the album though still a really good song. I usually skip <br />it after 4 minutes.  <br /> <br />This is the best album ever. I also recommend these other items <br />in addition to this album. <br /> <br />1. On Every Street       (1991) by Dire Straits <br />2. Sultans of Swing      (1998) by Dire Straits <br />3. Toys in the Attic     (1975) by Aerosmith <br />4. Get Your Wings        (1974) by Aerosmith <br />5. Nevermind             (1991) by Nirvana <br />6. Fool for the City     (1975) by Foghat <br />7. The Ragpicker's Dream (2002) by Mark Knopfler <br />8. Greatest Hits         (2004) by Guns N' Roses <br />9. Back in Black         (1980) by AC/DC <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UAO|5.0|This is an outstanding, brick solid rock & roll album, with some seriously melodic tunes and one of the greatest rhythm sections that I have ever heard on one record.  It's also a major blast by the way.  People often talk about the great song writing of Lennon & McCartney, and songs on this album such as Lennon's magnificent \\"In My Life\\" which brings to mind just about every fond memory that I have from childhood, and McCartney's rich, warm, and wonderfully melodic minor key marvel \\"Michelle\\", are stellar examples of just what great songwriters they were, (Harrison's \\"If I Needed Someone\\" is just as good by the way). But, the thing that stands out most to me about this album in particular, which I never hear anyone mention, is the spectacular rhythm section throughout.  Just check out the rhythm section on \\"Drive My Car\\", \\"You Won't See Me\\", \\"Think For Yourself\\", etc, etc...man that is some good stuff!  I did a review of this album about six months ago and I was not so kind to \\"Rubber Soul\\" and I now realize my gross error in judgment.  I say that just to say that if you are a younger listener who is not already familiar with this album, you may have to give it a few listens before it grows on you.  Once it does, this album is totally contagious, but I was turned off by this album at first because number one, it sounded very dated, much more so than their last couple of albums (which now that I think about it was kind of silly of me because an album's age or release date has nothing to do with how good it is or isn't). Number two, the songs sounded much too poppy and cutesy to me.  I had a particular thirst for further reaching, inventive concepts and ideas at the time.  If that is what you need, then \\"Revolver\\",\\" Sgt Pepper's\\" and \\"The White Album\\" are especially strong in those areas, and maybe you should start with one of those.  (\\"Abbey Road\\" is just flat out brilliant and there is nothing that I can say in a single sentence here to sum it up, but you can go back and read my review if you're a glutton for hyperbole and you've got way too much time on your hands).  This album truly is an amazing listening experience with a magnificent and undeniable groove.  It also has major, major replay value which is one of the primary marks of a great album.  But,  like most great albums, it is not completely flawless. \\"What Goes On\\" & \\"Girl\\" are not exactly examples of great songwriting in my view (they are both stellarly composed actually, it's just that the lyrics and the vocals aren't up to par with the rest of the album), but overall, this is one of the most compelling, whole, and complete listening experiences that I have ever had.  And once again, Paul McCartney really out did himself with the bass guitar on this album.  He provided what could be the most detailed and meticulous yet fluid and melodic rhythm section ever captured on a single album.  I can see why many people consider this to be The Beatles' best album, and it is certainly a respectable proposition, but this album and every one that follows are all so unique that opinions are bound to vary.  Either way, this is an essential classic album that all music lovers should give themselves the opportunity to experience!
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Collateral, brings to the screen the story of an LA taxi driver who finds himself driving a hitman across the city as he takes care of his contract killings.    <br />Overall, the acting is very good (both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx do a good job), but it's Jada Pinkett-Smith that really steals the show for me. <br />As for the plot, it is interesting, though not without flaws as the previous reviewer has very correctly pointed out. <br />In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it. <br />
B0006SSOHC|3.0|\\"Saw\\" is movie about a serial \\"killer\\", who doesnt actually kill his victims himself, he finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Which is actually a pretty interesting idea, and this movie had tons of potential. But its bogged down by marginal acting and holes in the plot. I really cant elaborate on the holes in the plot because it would give away the ending, but in the end you really dont get any resolution or closure. This is a decent movie to just sit around and watch with your friends, but dont expect anything oscar worthy.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I have to say that I am not a MAJOR fan of horror or of any video games related to Resident Evil, so I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the \\"details\\" I have to say that the movie was very good! <br />It is an action-packed Nine Monkeys/Tomb Raider type of adventure combining significant elements of horror.  <br />Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, with the exception of the female soldiers who are sooo \\"butch\\" and \\"tough.\\"  Have mercy on us please... Enough with that!  They are simply not realistic and therefore not convincing in their roles.   <br />Aside from that setback, the plot, the setting, the special effects, and the battles are all very good! <br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch! <br />
B0000C7GG2|5.0|Radiohead has been my favorite band since 7th grade and will always like them better than Muse. But this album in particular has many qualities people like about Radiohead (the angst, conspiracy theories, lashing out against society) without some of the thing people dislike about Radiohead (namely Thom Yorke's singing). <br /> <br />With that aside, this album is good not only because it sounds similar to one of the most impressionable bands of our time, but because it just rocks out. This band presents sadness, love, terror and regret all in about one hour's time. Songs range from grinding, gritty guitars to a beautiful Mozart-like requiem at the end. <br /> <br />Definitely an album every lover of rock needs to hear.
B00001IVOR|5.0|The lyrics on this album is the best Wu collection of conscious lyrics.  The production is near-best of all Wu albums.  This is a must have.<br /><br />Alot of exercise on this.  RZA shines, U-God shines, Meth shines, Ghost can't lose, Masta Kill shines....this is just one of the best efforts put out from the group.  Only thing that comes close to this, as far as Wu-tang as a whole, is the collaborations on Liquid Swords and the Ironman album.  But Forever is beyond all that.  Just get it.

B00005JN0T|5.0|I loved this movie. The graphics were amazing, and like all Will Smith movies the story and action were on point!  <br /> <br />The movie takes place in the future where owning a robot is just an ordinary thing. They do everything from cooking to babysitting and everyone trusts them, because afterall they are only machines they can't think or feel right?  <br /> <br />Those who developed the Robots made 3 simple laws for them to follow: <br /> <br />Law One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law.  <br /> <br />Law Two: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.  <br /> <br />Law Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law.  <br /> <br />So with the rules in place it is safe for humans to own robots... right? ...But when a prominent scientist dies after taking a fall from his high rise office suite Detective Spooner begins to think that a certian Robot is behind it all. He does not trust the machines (and for good reason which is later revealed in a flashback scene) and begins questioning a robot whom he thinks is involved... <br /> <br />Then the unthinkable, the robots go nuts and try to take over!  It is up to Spooner and his men to stop this... and they just might need that special robot they don't trust to help them... <br /> <br />This movie is based on a book written in the 1940s. It is simply amazing. The graphics are stunning, and the action is well choreographed. I reccommend this movie highly as you will not be dissappointed...  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Many people whose first language is English don't seem to like their favorite foreign films dubbed in English. Well, that's understandable; here in Japan, we have Eddie Murphy speaking Japanese---in dubbed movies, of course---and most Japanese people don't seem to like it either; it simply doesn't sound like 'Eddie'. However, I don't think that necessarily means that dubbed films are always bad. In fact, there are exceptions---maybe, not too many, though---that the dub is as good as the original. And I do believe this English 'Porco Rosso' is one of such exceptions. Personally, I even think the voice acting of Porco is better than the original, except for the added 'grunts', which are not in the Japanese version.    So, if you have a bias against dub, I advise you to discard it, as far as this film is concerned; you can enjoy this wonderful gift from Miyazaki in English on this DVD---as well as in Japanese with subtitles if you would still like to.    Arigato Disney for the wonderful job!!
B00005JMXX|2.0|While I enjoyed the special FX on this one the story was a bit too far fetched for me... I usually hate when people say that because after all it is a work of fiction but this was out there. I feel like what the characters did and said were contradictory EX. the man tells everyone how they couldn't go outside because they will instantly freeze, yet he and friends proceed to walk from DC to NYC... ya...  <br /> <br />Basic story... world is ending... mans son is in NYC on class trip... man wants to save him... man travels in the killer weather to save son... lots of people die... man reaches son... man and son live... blah blah blah the end... all admist some cool special FX <br /> <br />The movie wasn't that lost on me. I enjoyed the special FX as I stated above. Some parts looked as if we were watching a news peice and the disasters were happening... but the FX alone weren't enough alone to save the movie for me. <br /> <br />I suppose its message was to take care of the earth.
0780628551|2.0|Yes. This movie rips off Rosemary's Baby. I didn't like Rosemary's Baby. This movie is worse. Compared to this film, I highly recommend Rosemary's Baby. I enjoyed Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron's performances. Forget the story. These two people drive the movie. These two very beautiful people.     Spencer (Depp) is an astronaut. His wife, Jillian, (Theron) is a loving wife and second grade teacher. They are the epitome of all-Americans. While he's in space, his ship loses contact for 2 minutes. These 2 minutes end up changing their lives forever. No kidding. 2 minutes. This is the movie. 2 minutes. What happened in those two minutes? Jillian begins to worry. He won't talk about it. His flight partner died afterward because of it, and the guy's wife killed herself. When Jillian becomes pregnant with twins, she learns that the other wife was also pregnant with twins when she killed herself. Odd. Jillian digs deeper into this mystery until she uncovers a horror that she never imagined.     The ending. Nope. Didn't like it. Didn't like the end of Rosemary's Baby either. No vindication! Not for Rosemary or for Jillian! What happens to Jillian makes me even madder, though. See for yourself. I hope none of you watch it and say, \\"Oh, how poignant.\\" Ick!! I recommend this movie solely based on the perfomances. Those are worth (I suppose) at least a look see. And, hey, if all you want to do is stare at Depp (Or Theron), by all means, get this movie. It's great for that.
B00009P1MP|5.0|I must emphatically disagree with Amazon.com's reviewer, who seems to be paying Don McLean a left-handed compliment.  This album is a classic!!  It takes its place, in the folk genre, right alongside the great albums of folk and rock history.  <br /> <br />It's true that this album isn't as caustic as the best that  <br />Bob Dylan produced.  Yet, every song here--with the possible  <br />exception of the last two, added for reissue on CD--will strike <br />a responsive chord.  Beginning with the title track and  <br />continuing on through, the songs touch the listener on a deeply <br />contemplative level.  They leave an impression long after the  <br />final notes have receded into silence.   <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|These men have made some great albums.  This is not one of them. <br /> <br />It has no substance.  It is a total waste of time/money. <br /> <br />If your money comes hard skip this one. <br /> <br />It is so sad.  This could have been a great collection.
B00000DG1R|5.0|\\"Duran Duran\\" I feel is one of the most underrated bands in history. These guys have cut two number one hits and numerous top twenty classics. Though they rely more on synthesizers and image more than many other bands, the music is still catchy and packs a punch to it. They have recently made a comeback of sorts with \\"Astronaunt\\", which itself is a pretty solid album. \\"Greatest\\" packs together all their hits from the 80's up to the mid 90's. <br /> <br />The CD is not ordered chronologically, but you can still tell the evolution of the band from listening to the CD. Songs like \\"Rio\\", \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\", \\"Girls On Film\\", and \\"Planet Earth\\" were helped in popularity thanks to their very creative videos that were played back in the day non-stop on MTV. More than that though, they are strong songs that'll make you dance. \\"A View To a Kill\\" was the James Bond theme from the movie with the same name starring Roger Moore in 1985. It is a very cool song and it hit number one. The other number one, \\"The Reflex\\", is also included, though personally I find the song to get annoying and I don't like it as much as the other cuts on the CD. Other cuts from the early 80's that you probably will recognize and enjoy include \\"New Moon on Monday\\", \\"Wild Boys\\", and \\"Is There Something I Should Know\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Notorious\\" signals a transition in Duran Duran. Two of the members left the band, creating a trio. Still a strong song (sampled by the late Notorious B.I.G. in a song), it does have a different sound to it than the earlier cuts. Some of the stronger cuts in this period (the late 80's) besides \\"Notorious\\" include \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\", \\"Union of the Snake\\", and \\"Skin Trade\\". <br /> <br />The 90's were relatively a quiet period for Duran Duran, but two songs did hit the top 40 and make some noise on radio stations. \\"Ordinary World\\" sounds much more mature and mellow compared to the glam, synth driven songs of the 80's. Though it is different, I like the song a lot. It'sa pretty reflective song and a good one to listen to if you are in a thinking mood. \\"Electric Barbellia\\", a song named after a famous villiness, is the other song from the 90's. The song is a dance hit, but sounds much more modern since there are not many synthesizers used and has a more calmer sound than their dance hits from the 80's. <br /> <br />If you are a casual fan of Duran Duran and don't want to spend money on all the albums, interested in seeing what Duran Duran is about, or just looking for music to add to your 80's collection, \\"Greatest\\" is a great (no pun indeeded) album to pick up. If you have gotten into Duran Duran recently with their reunion comeback (the original five together for the first time since 1985!) and want to see what their past work is like, pick up \\"Greatest\\" to hear one of the video pioneers: musicans with synth soaked beats and lots of glam to entice their image. Ah, to be young again.

B0001AP12G|5.0|God, girls, guns, and game. Those are the four G's that Kanye West raps about in his debut \\"College Dropout\\". A highly regarded hip-hop/R&B producer, he stepped back from the board and stepped in front of the microphone. With a strong group of collaborators (ranging from Ludacris to Jamie Foxx to a boys gospel choir), Kayne sets himself up for a good hip hop album. Here are some of the stronger cuts and a description of each:    1. All Falls Down- A popular radio cut, Kayne sings about the confusion and difficulties that he faces with the opposite sex. A song that many guys who don't understand girls could relate to!    2. Jesus Walks- The song that has been discussed and debated over and over again. Many think it's Kaynes attempt to \\"sell out\\" to a Cotemporary Christian Music audience. Some hardcore Christians believe it's Kaynes way to make this a Christian album. My opinion is neither. I think Kayne is just giving props to his religious beliefs, like a guy would give props to his best friend. This isn't a Christian album, and Kayne didn't have that as his intention. Rather, he just included a song that shows what he believes in religious wise. Many other rappers have done this before to on secular albums like 2Pac, D.M.X., and even MC Hammer back in the day. There are two types of Christians: the bible belt, evangelical, fundamentalist Christians and the living life, keeping quiet, more laid back Christians. I think Kayne is a part of the latter, he isn't trying to win converts over, he is just sharing his beliefs.     3. Slow Jamz- Maybe my favorite song on this album, the silky smooth beat and lyrics make for a more upbeat love song in the vein of \\"Billie Jean\\" by Michael Jackson. It was initially released as a single by Twista on the radio with Kanye and Jamie Foxx providing assistance, but luckily it makes it's way onto this album.    4. Through the Wire- A pretty upbeat, almost retro style song, infamous for Kanye putting up the money himself to create the music video since it wasn't very popular among the record company at first.    5. Breathe In, Breathe Out- This hardcore dance like song (with the help of Ludacris) shows Kanye at his most upbeat and also shows his sense of humor coming out with jokes throughout the lyrics.    The album overall is a solid hip hop album. A lot of variety in the music. It isn't anything too new, which is why I'm glad it didn't win album of the year grammy, but still a solid album for hip hop fans to pick up and deserving of the eight grammy nominations it received. With his big ego, wide ambitions, and love of variety, I sense that a sophomore slump is not in store for Mr. West, \\"most unlikely to not be famous\\".
0671027344|4.0|I probably wouldn't have written this, Amy, unless I thought you'd read it as well, so here it is... <br /> <br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower <br />(four stars)  <br /> <br />\\"A Technical Flop and a Great Read\\" <br /> <br />First off, I will say that this is pulp. It's not high literature. The fact that this is being treated as such by the reviewers on this site confuses the hell out of me. If you want downer brilliant art, try reading Doesteovsky's Brother's Karamazov, or Hemingway's Farewell to Arms... or any of the books that Charlie reads off of Bill in the course of the book.  <br /> <br />So I wouldn't call it art. To think it is is to sort of miss the point. This book fails terribly on all technical levels.  <br /> <br />The prose are weak and simplistic. They are written by a 15 year old, but he's supposed to be a literary genius. He reads Fountainhead by Ayn Rand in less than a week while maintaining a 4.0 grade average, and hanging out with his disfucntional friends nearly every day.  <br /> <br />The problems are all straight out of after school specials.  <br /> <br />Teen abortion: Which was done as a boring plot device to waste pages and didn't do much to move the story along.  <br /> <br />Drug use: (Which the author portrayed in the most ridiculous over the top manner. The LSD scene involved something as absurd as someone doing a line of crystal meth and then taking a nice relaxing nap. But this is not Electric Koolaid Acid Test or a Timiothy Leary book, so this misses the point.)  <br /> <br />Homosexual love affairs/homophobia/hate crime: Out of all the teen melodrama stuff in the book, this part really works. It's been done to death, but done well here.  <br /> <br />Sexual abuse: done in the standard hackneyed manner  <br /> <br />...and so on...  <br /> <br />But here's the rub for you high browers out there that were giving this one and two stars... you didn't get the point.  <br /> <br />This book, like The Stranger and all the other books,  if you folks didn't get it, had a large part to do with the structure of the book.  <br /> <br />Ludwig Wittgenstein used to say that pulp books had more and richer philosophy than that which came from the ivory towers of academia.  <br />You just have to look for it.  <br /> <br />Let's take one of the books Bill gives Charlie, and look at it briefly.  <br />The Stranger by Albert Camus.  <br />All the complaints against this book can be put on to The Stranger, and those of you that maligned Perks and say you liked The Stranger probably only say so because you think you should like it.  <br />The plot of The Stranger can be summed up almost entirely in three sentences.  <br />A man commits a murder.  <br />A man goes to trial.  <br />A man is executed.  <br />Now this is the important part of The Stranger and Wallflower.. (even though I wouldn't actually compare them directly on merit. I highly doubt that Wallflower will be taught in university literature or philosophy classes a hundred years from now, but it's the same idea)  <br />The important part is that you're seeing these cliche events through the eyes of the narrator. In both cases deeply disturbed people in very different ways.   <br />Charlie, the main in wallflowers, is weak, nervous, frail, and has no self perspective. If people hate him, he hates himself. If people love him, he feels great, etc. He sobs very often at what would be fairly trivial events for most people. He's hyperliterate to almost the point of absurdity. He's frightened by many things. And he finds exaltation in things as simple as a song by the Smiths or how a friend looks dressed up as Doctor Fraken Furtur...  <br />The story isn't about the plot, it's about seeing the cliches that we're used to in this current zeitgeist (as was the case with Camus and the then over used cliche of the murder/trial novel) through the eyes of a truly unusual individual.  <br /> <br />That's the art, and that's the philosophy.  <br /> <br />So stop complaining about the prose or the lack of originality in the plot. That's not the point.  <br /> <br />
0451191153|5.0|If you are interested at all in art, creativity, individualism, the masses vs. the individual, etc., you should read this book. You would find it very intriguing. Ignore what other people have said regarding Rand's philosophy...just read the book and make your own decision. I thought it was quite interesting (and also very satisfyingly fast-paced), but now that you've read my review, you should read the book yourself. That's it, really.

B000084T18|3.0|The first 6 tracks or so are awesome.  If you want to buy a cd with a few great tracks, this is worth it.  The first half of the CD proves that 50 is still 2nd to the king of NY, LL Cool J. The production is good and the beats flow well. It's worth the $10, if you are using the foot locker coupon that I'm going to re-gift.

Every day, a neighbor (Garner) comes to read to her from a handwritten notebook that tells the story of a romance between a couple named Ally and Noah.  Ally loves the story and the company--and sometimes she remembers who her companion was.  Both Garner and Rowland did an excellent job acting in a poignant tale about loss, love, and not letting go.  This is definitely a five or six hankie story, but well worth it if you are interested in the romance genre.   <br /> <br />
B00004XOWM|1.0|One day I found myself a victim of nostalgia and decided to listen to this CD again.  Unfortunately, this was a dreadful mistake and I unknowably subjected myself to a very practical form of torture.  Usually I would discuss the components of the record first but the intro lacks so much I have to discuss it.  The intro is some garbled alien voice imitating an alien transmission.  Fine I can deal with odd music, but the next track is unforgivable.  \\"Hot Dog\\" boasts an undisputed record of 52 something \\"F\\" words along with other disgusting dialogue.  Not only is it composed of trash but Fred Durst takes shots at Nine Inch Nails, One of the most talented bands of today.  After this passes, I am so thoroughly disgusted with this record I think of flushing it down the toilet as it might be animal feces in disguise.  The next eight something songs pass by and almost induce me to a cationic state.  The only attempt to save itself is with Xzibit mediocre rapping and the interesting \\"Boiler\\".  I usually would not attack someone's musical interests but if you find this record entertaining in any prospect I have two words.  Grow up.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|I doubt I would want to watch \\"Collateral\\" more than once.   <br /> <br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cabdriver who dreams of owning a top-flight limo service.  He's just driving a cab til he can get the cash to do it right.  He drives at night:  the traffic's better, the tips are higher.   <br /> <br />He picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), who offers him double his shift pay if he'll break the rules and take him to visit five 'friends.'  First stop, when a body lands on the cab, he realizes his passenger is a sociopathic killer performing hits for a drug dealer.   <br /> <br />This begins a surreal ride down the dark side of men's souls.  Max tries to get away, to stop what's happening, and is foiled at every point.  <br /> <br />Until the last hit.  It's Max's previous fare, a lovely US Attorney.  Will he be able to save her?  Himself?   <br /> <br />While the movie's premise was interesting and the action for the most part flowed well, there were long gaps of dialogue that took away from the action going on.  Further, one character who I had thought was going to be on Max's side got killed quickly.  What was the point of developing a character to that point and blowing him away?   <br /> <br />Overall, I think that was my major question about the movie.  What was the point?  My opinion, this film is not worth owning.

0679446230|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It starts off a little difficult to read but quickly it starts to flow smoothly with its own rhythmic style. The story is about a man, Okonkwo, who has dreams of being important and powerful in his clan. He seems stubborn and hard, void of emotion, but you begin to see the true depth of the man who is so set by what he has to do, what is expected of him by his clan's traditions and his own self-judgment. When the clan comes to take the young slave boy who has been in his home for three years, he does not object even though the plan is to kill the young boy. Okonkwo really likes the boy and even though he takes part in the boy's death, he is troubled by that act. His duty in following the ancestral traditions shows its' strength in the rules that guide their lives.  <br />There is so much that happens in the book, so much insight into the lives of the clan you become absorbed and fascinated by the simple, yet very complex lives.  <br />Because of an unfortunate incident in which Okonkwo accidentally kills one of his clansmen, he and his family are exiled to his mother's homeland for seven years. When they arrive, his uncle and family take him in and show him he is part of the family, even though he has been exiled from his own clan. No questions are asked and no judgments are made. At first Okonkwo is withdrawn and bitter about being there, but the explanation his uncle has as to why he should be sent to his mother's homeland it worth the whole book-it is written so nicely I couldn't even try to explain it.  <br />When the seven years are up and Okonkwo returns to his clan, he is faced with a new hurdle, the changes that have taken place including the arrival of a white priest and the conversion of some of his clansman to the new religion. The clan and its ways are falling apart. This is such an excellent story about a man who is struggling to make a place in the world he knew and seeing its coming death. A fabulous book! <br />
B000002N3J|5.0|-Something to Remember (1995)-<br /><br />Released back in 1995, one year after Madonna released \\"Bedtime Stories\\", she decided to release a collection of some of her greatest ballads, and many people looked at it as an attempt for her to win back some of the fans she lost during the sex controversy. Whatever her intentions were, the album peaked at #6 in the US, and managed to sell about 3 million copies, which is more than both \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories\\". The album has songs like \\"I'll Remember\\", one of her best ballads, which was the theme song from the movie \\"With Honors\\", and was a big hit for her, peaking at #2 in the US, and \\"This Used to Be My Playgroud\\", another great ballad, which was featured in the movie \\"A League of Their Own\\", was a #1 hit for Madonna. Madonna also made 4 new songs for the album. \\"I Want You\\", a very haunting and beautiful techo ballad, wasn't released as a single, but had a video, \\"You'll See\\", kind of like the sequel to Take a Bow, an amazing song, peaked at #6 in the US, \\"One More Chance\\", a good acoustic ballad, wasn't released in the US, but peaked at #11 in the UK, and \\"I Want You [Orchestral]\\", which is the same as \\"I Want You\\", except the techno sounds have been removed.<br /><br />1.

0743454537|5.0|I have never read any of Picoult's books before, and I thought this one was wonderful and a great book to start me on more of her books.  I actually cried at the end. For those reviews that have said the ending was disappointing, in a way it was, but not how they viewed it.  I was disappointed in not getting all the view points like we had throughout the novel.  It starts off with Anna's viewpoint (the sister initiating the lawsuit), and then alternates with either Sara (mother), Brian (father), Jesse (brother), Campbell (lawyer) and Julia (guardian ad litem).  But we don't hear from Kate (sister that is ill) toward the end of the book.  But at the very end we only get one view point and I would have liked to see them all again.  Although, this ending was not one of the \\"expected\\" outcomes, it seemed to give the book more closure.  I am extrememly glad I read this book and highly recommend it.  However, like I said keep some tissue handy,
B00005J6T1|5.0|-Madonna (1983)-<br /><br />Released back in 1983, when Madonna was still relatively unknown, this album helped her on her way to becoming the icon she is today. It's easy to see after the first time you listen to the album, that it's definitely a dance album. Not all of the songs have the best lyrics, but they definitely make up for that with how catchy they are. After \\"Everybody\\" became a big club hit in 1982, Madonna released \\"Holiday\\" as her first single, which gave her her first US Top 20 hit (#16). Madonna then released \\"Borderline\\", which gave her her first US Top 10 (#10), and \\"Lucky Star\\", which gave her her first US Top 5 (#4). The album was a slow seller at first, but ended up peaking at #8, and has managed to sell 5 million copies in the US alone since it's release.<br /><br />1. Lucky Star  (10/10)<br />2. Borderline (10/10)<br />3. Burning Up (10/10)<br />4. I Know It (9/10)<br />5. Holiday (10/10)<br />6. Think of Me (8/10)<br />7. Physical Attraction (10/10)<br />8. Everybody (10/10)<br />9. Burning Up [12\\" Version] (8/10)<br />10. Lucky Star [New Mix] (8/10)<br /><br />All in all, this a good, solid debut album. The unreleased songs off of the album, with the exception of \\"Think of Me\\", are very good. Especially \\"Physical Attraction\\". And although I'm not a big fan of remixes, the remixes of \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" are quite good. But I definitely prefer the originals. Who would have known back in 1983, that Madonna would become the biggest female artist in history. Considering so many people were quick to write her off as a one-hit wonder.<br /><br />My Top 5 off of the album are...<br /><br />5) Everybody<br />4) Burning Up<br />3) Borderline<br />2) Holiday<br />1) Physical Attraction
B00001W9G0|5.0|People love Barbra or hate her. There is not a  position in between. Well, I love her. And evidently I love this film. Some could think this is only another romance film, but I have always thought that The Way We Were has that extra something that makes it a great movie. Basically this is the story of a what could have been. What could have happened if Katie and Hubell were diferent and the circumstances also. Katie is one of those characters everybody, no matter if male of female, can identify with. Because we all have been in her situation, have felt like outcasts, like eternal losers. So we just love her. And also admire her because she has principles, and she follows them till the end. Hubell, on the other hand, is not only a handsome lucky man. He is an interesting character that tries to pass through life making the slightest noise possible. And here is where both clash. He has the talent but not the courage, while she has the courage but not the talent requested. <br />Love here is something that both see from diferent perspectives. She understands it in a total sense. When you love someone you give everything, and here is where the story becomes so tender and appealing. Because Katie is ready to give everything, and Hubell only to  a certain point. It is  a bittersweet romance with two people that love each other but that cannot make their love survive in the world they are living. <br /> <br />Apart from the outstanding performances. The talent of Pollack is evident. He has a grace and elegance in this film that is hard to find in other films. He lets the characters introduce themselves. And the score is simply fantastic. It seems that all elements that create a film are here together working in a perfect combination. The last scene is still as moving as the first time I watched it. <br />This edition is definitively a keeper. And I recommend it to anyone who loves a good story and good performances.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|-Like a Virgin (1984)-<br /><br />Released back in 1984, this is the album that made Madonna the icon she is today. It had gone on to become her biggest selling studio album in the US, selling well over 10 million copies, and peaking at #1. The title track is one of the 80s most recognizable songs, and along with it's controversial video, gave Madonna her first US #1 hit, where it stayed for 6 weeks. Other big hits from the album include \\"Material Girl\\" (which is probably best known for it's Marilyn Monroe inspired video) (#2), \\"Angel\\" (#5), and \\"Dress You Up\\" (#5), all of which are very catchy and upbeat.<br /><br />1. Material Girl (10/10)<br />2. Angel (9/10)<br />3. Like a Virgin (10/10)<br />4. Over and Over (10/10)<br />5. Love Don't Live Here Anymore (10/10)<br />6. Dress You Up (10/10)<br />7. Shoo-Bee-Doo (9/10)<br />8. Pretender (9/10)<br />9. Stay (10/10)<br />10. Like a Virgin [Extended Dance Remix] (8/10)<br />11. Material Girl [Extended Dance Remix] (8/10)<br /><br />With this album, Madonna proves why she's become the biggest female artist in history. Other than the singles, you have great songs like \\"Over and Over\\", which is one of Madonna's best dance songs, \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\", which proved that Madonna could make excellent ballads, and \\"Stay\\", which like \\"Over and Over\\" is one of Madonna's best dance songs. \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\" and \\"Pretender\\" are also great, but not some of my favorites. The remixes of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Material Girl\\" are also quite good, but I still prefer the originals. All in all, a great sophomore album, and one of the classic albums of the 80s.<br /><br />My Top 5 off of the album are...<br /><br />5) Like a Virgin<br />4) Love Don't Live Here Anymore<br />3) Stay<br />2) Material Girl<br />1) Over and Over

B000002MFN|5.0|-Erotica (1992)-<br /><br />Released back in 1992, this is the album that caused a national backlash against Madonna. In 1992, Madonna released this album, which peaked at #2 in the US, and has only sold around 2 million copies to date. Madonna also released the box office bomb \\"Body of Evidence\\", and the international smash \\"Sex\\" book. This was when Madonna was at the peak of her sexual assault on the world. This is definitely one of my favorite Madonna albums of all time, and it's also one of my favorite albums of all time. The first single to be released from this album was the title track, and it's definitely one of the sexiest songs of all time. It's also a very dark song, which just makes the song even more amazing. The video that was released with this song caused even more controversy than \\"Justify My Love\\", and was of course, banned from MTV. Again, the video was released on VHS, and sold millions. The other singles released from this album were \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", which peaked at #7 in the US, and is one of Madonna's best dance songs, \\"Rain\\", an absolutely beautiful ballad, which only peaked at #14 in the US, \\"Fever\\" which is an amazing cover of Peggy Lee's 50s classic, wasn't released in the US, but peaked at #6 in the UK, \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", which also wasn't released in the US, but peaked at #15 in Australia, and \\"Bad Girl\\", which is one of my all time favorite Madonna songs, and is my favorite Madonna ballad. Just an absolutely stunning song, but so underrated, only peaking at #36 in the US.<br /><br />1. Erotica (10/10)<br /><br />2. Fever (10/10)<br /><br />3. Bye Bye Baby (10/10)<br /><br />4. Deeper and Deeper (10/10)<br /><br />5. Where Life Begins (10/10)<br /><br />6. Bad Girl (10/10)<br /><br />7. Waiting (10/10)<br /><br />8. Theif of Hearts (10/10)<br /><br />9. Words (10/10)<br /><br />10. Rain (10/10)<br /><br />11. Why It's So Hard (/10)<br /><br />12. In This Life (10/10)<br /><br />13. Secret Garden (10/10)<br /><br />This is another one of the few albums I own where I would rate every song 10/10. \\"Where Life Begins\\" is a slow and jazzy song, and I love the analogys it uses. \\"Waiting\\" is another great song. It's another jazzy song, but a lot of the songs on the album are. \\"Theif of Hearts\\" is one of my favorite unreleased songs, where Madonna uses the word \\"b****\\" quite a few times. My favorite part is where Madonna sings \\"You do it, you'll take it. You screw it, you'll fake it. Undo it, you'll break it. You're over, you can't take it\\". I love it! \\"Words\\" is definitely my favorite unreleased song. Everything about this song is just great. \\"Why It's So Hard\\" is kinda reminiscent of \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" from \\"Like a Prayer\\", where it's upbeat and catchy, but the lyrics are more dark and depressing. A great song. \\"In This Life\\" is a sad and stunning ballad about some of the friends Madonna has lost to AIDS. Another one of my favorites. \\"Secret Garden\\" is probably my least favorite song on the album, but it's still a great song. The lyrics are very poetic, and it sounds like a song about Madonna longing to be a mother. Now, there are lots of people that have said that this album is just about sex, but that's not true. There are only about 2 or 3 songs on here about sex. All in all, the is definitely one of Madonna's best albums, which deserved so much more recognition than it ever recieved.<br /><br />My Top 5 off of the album are...<br /><br />5) Words<br /><br />4) Rain<br /><br />3) Erotica<br /><br />2) Deeper and Deeper<br /><br />1) Bad Girl/10. \\"Where Life Begins\\" is a slow and jazzy song, and I love the analogys it uses. \\"Waiting\\" is another great song.

B0006399FS|4.0|I have listened to the CD about three times and it is growing on me. Not many first-time listens make me say any CD is great. It's not love at first \\"play\\" most times. Instead, it is a getting-to-know process that leads me valuing a work. <br /> <br />For me, U2's appeal has never been in the lyrics, but in the powerful melodies and Bono's voice. This music is right there on those accounts. <br /> <br />Vertigo, in one man's humble opinion, is tiresome already. Coming from most other artists, I wouldn't give it a second thought, but I have higher standards from this band. <br /> <br />But there are the typical powerful U2 cuts that remind you how satisfying their music really is, and why I always look forward to new releases. <br /> <br />Right now, I think the value for the cost is good and in time, I know the enjoyment I will receive for the price will be great. <br /> <br />If you are a longtime U2 follower, this is a worthy addition to your collection.
B00005J6T0|5.0|-True Blue (1986)-<br /><br />Released back in 1986, this album made Madonna an even bigger superstar then she had become with \\"Like a Virgin\\". It peaked at #1, and has gone on to sell more than 7 million copies in the US alone. The album contains 5 huge Top 5 singles, 3 of which made it to #1. \\"Live to Tell\\" for 1 week, \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" for 2 weeks, and \\"Open Your Heart\\" for 1 week. \\"True Blue\\" made it to #3, while \\"La Isla Bonita\\" made it to #4. I often regard \\"Live to Tell\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" as three of Madonna's absolute best 80s songs. \\"Open Your Heart\\" and \\"True Blue\\" are both also very good.<br /><br />1. Papa Don't Preach (10/10)<br />2. Open Your Heart (10/10)<br />3. White Heat (8/10)<br />4. Live to Tell (10/10)<br />5. Where's the Party (10/10)<br />6. True Blue (10/10)<br />7. La Isla Bonita (10/10)<br />8. Jimmy, Jimmy (8/10)<br />9. Love Makes the World Go Round (10/10)<br />10. True Blue [The Color Mix] (8/10)<br />11. La Isla Bonita [Extended Remix] (9/10)<br /><br />While quite a few of the unreleased songs on this album are pretty weak, when the songs are good, they're great! The best unreleased song is definitely \\"Where's the Party\\", which is one of Madonna's absolute best dance songs. \\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\" is also very good, with a very good message. \\"White Heat\\" is one of the rockiest songs Madonna has made, and is pretty good, but I really don't like the spoken parts. \\"Jimmy, Jimmy\\" is just pure pop, and is definitely my least favorite song on the album. Like I've said before, the remixes are good, but I prefer the originals. I do happen to like the \\"La Isla Bonita\\" remix more than I like some remixes though. All in all, another classic 80s album from the Queen of Pop.<br /><br />My Top 5 off of the album are...<br /><br />5) Open Your Heart<br />4) Where's the Party<br />3) La Isla Bonita<br />2) Papa Don't Preach<br />1) Live to Tell
B000075BFK|5.0|Songs like Street Fame, Thugz Mansion, and Catchin Feeling make this album great. Tupac brings us a great album once again. If you like Tupac, this album is a must. If you don't, it's an excellent introduction to his world.
B000002MUW|5.0|-Bedtime Stories (1994)-<br /><br />Released in 1994, two years after Madonna released \\"Erotica\\", the world was still outraged. Madonna released this album, which again, only peaked at #2, and sold 2 million copies since it's release. This album, along with \\"Erotica\\" and \\"American Life\\" are probably Madonna most underrated albums. Madonna decided to go with more of an R&B sound for this album, and it turned out amazing. This is another one of my all time favorite Madonna albums. The first single to be released from the album was \\"Secret\\", and it put Madonna back on the charts, peaking at #3. It's a really great song. And then Madonna released \\"Take a Bow\\", which put her back on top of the charts. The song peaked at #1, and stayed there for 7 weeks, giving Madonna her biggest US single to date. The song is definitely one of Madonna's greatest ballads. Two other singles were also released, \\"Bedtime Story\\" and \\"Human Nature\\". \\"Human Nature\\" is a very bass heavy song, directed to the critics that bashed her during her sex phase, and is another great song. \\"Bedtime Story\\" is just absolutely amazing, and along with \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\", one of my all time favorite Madonna songs. The song was co-written by Bjork, and was years ahead of it's time when it was released. Everything about the song is just amazing, and the video is one of the best I've ever seen. Also, at the time of the videos release, it was the most expensive video ever made.<br /><br />1. Survival (10/10)<br />2. Secret (10/10)<br />3. I'd Rather Be Your Lover (10/10)<br />4. Don't Stop (9/10)<br />5. Inside of Me (/10)<br />6. Human Nature (10/10)<br />7. Forbidden Love (8/10)<br />8. Love Tried to Welcome Me (10/10)<br />9. Sanctuary (10/10)<br />10. Bedtime Story (10/10)<br />11. Take a Bow (10/10)<br /><br />As with \\"Erotica\\", every song on the album is great. \\"Survival\\" is a great way to start of the album, and is very R&Bish. It talks about how Madonna felt about how she was backlashed, but how she survived. \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\" is another great song, that features a guest rapper. \\"Don't Stop\\" is a great dance song, but it isn't one of my favorites. \\"Inside of Me\\" is my definitely my favorite unreleased song. It's amazing. I love the way Madonna uses her breathing like an instrument. It's a song about her mother, but it could easily be interpreted a different way. \\"Forbidden Love\\" is probably the worst song on the album, but it's still a good song. \\"Love Tried to Welcome Me\\" is one of Madonna's most beautiful ballads, and could have easily replaced \\"Forbidden Love\\" on \\"Something to Remember\\". \\"Sanctuary\\" is an amazing song, that follows along the same lines as \\"Bedtime Story\\". All in all, this is another one of Madonna's best albums, which wasn't as successful as it should have been.<br /><br />My Top 5 off of the album are...<br /><br />5) Love Tried to Welcome Me<br />4) Human Nature<br />3) Take a Bow<br />2) Inside of Me<br />1) Bedtime Storyfeatures a guest rapper. \\"Don't Stop\\" is a great dance song, but it isn't one of my favorites. \\"Inside of Me\\" is my definitely my favorite unreleased song.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I am not a huge Green Day fan, but have enjoyed their earlier music in the past.  I have a few friends that had the album and once in a while I would hear it in the car for a block or two,  Not much said.  However, one day I decided to take a careful listen and this is what I found out after I bought it myself.    The music scene in my estimation has been horrible since the decline of hard rock and alternative-the world has been subjected to mindless power rap and pretty boy/girl poster music since 2000 started.  I haven't even purchased an album since this time because of the horrible illusion of music out there today.  However, when I played American Idiot for the first time I played it 4 times in succession-it was that good.  If you are a connoisseur of really good music, you will absolutely love this album. This album is a truely wonderful mix of different styles of genius.  Classic headbanging, with pulsating punk, infused with fun and clever pop songs, and just when you thought that was all it offered, Green Day surprises you again with wonderful ballads.  Not since Guns n Roses, Use Your Illusion have I ever heard such a varying, brilliant combination of successful style of songs.    Yes, this is a political album to some sorts that can be construed as Bush bashing, if you really want to look far into it.  I myself am a Bush backer and troop supporter yet have fun with the lyrics of the album, everybody is entitled to their ideas.  What it really comes down to is the music is fun to listen to and catchy, but in a good way.  People in this world need to lighten up a little bit and allow for differing opinions and don't take things so seriously, it is what made this country great!!!!!    Those who do not like this album are either talentless wannabes who are trying to make a name for themselves in the music industry and are simply jealous of Green Days success, or they are the type of American Idiot liberals who continue to try and manifest the overused and meaningless term of \\"sell-outs\\" for lack of a reasonable explanation, as if the term sell-out really means anything, or they are just brain-washed mannequins who can't overcome a differing political opinion with an open mind. Green Day is not selling out but branching out into what the music industry is asking for and what the public wants to listen to.    This album is a must get.
B000002LLC|5.0|-Dick Tracy: \\"I'm Breathless\\" (1990)-<br /><br />Released back in 1990, this was a very unique sort of soundtrack to the movie \\"Dick Tracy\\". Madonna sings every song. The album peaked at #2 in the US, and managed to sell over 2 million copies since it's release. The first song released from the album was \\"Vogue\\", and is just an amazing song. Probably Madonna's best dance song to date. It's one of my favorite Madonna songs, and it's probably her biggest hit ever. It peaked at #1 in the US for 3 weeks, and even went 2x Platinum. The second single was \\"Hanky Panky\\", a song about spanking. It peaked at #10 in the US. which I find quite surprising.<br /><br />1. He's a Man (10/10)<br /><br />2. Sooner or Later (10/10)<br /><br />3. Hanky Panky (9/10)<br /><br />4. I'm Going Bananas (7/10)<br /><br />5. Cry Baby (8/10)<br /><br />6. Something to Remember (10/10)<br /><br />7. Back in Business (10/10)<br /><br />8. More (9/10)<br /><br />9. What Can You Lose? (8/10)<br /><br />10. Now I'm Following You, Pt. 1 (10/10)<br /><br />11. Now I'm Following You, Pt. 2 (10/10)<br /><br />12. Vogue (10/10)<br /><br />A lot of the songs on the album are very good, while others just aren't. \\"He's a Man\\" is a really great song. \\"Sooner or Later\\" is just amazing. A really relaxing jazz song, that even won an Oscar! \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" and \\"Cry Baby\\" are both really silly songs, but I don't care for them too much. \\"Something to Remember\\" is another amazing song, and is one of my favorite Madonna ballads. Madonna's 1995 collection of ballads was even named after this song. \\"Back in Business\\" is a great song, and it kinda reminds me of \\"He's a Man\\". \\"More\\" is another great song, but it isn't one of my favorites. \\"What Can You Lose?\\" isn't one of my favorites, and I actually find it rather forgettable. The guy singing with Madonna should just leave the singing to Madonna. \\"Now I'm Following You, Pt. 1 and Pt. 2\\" are two more great songs, but I prefer Pt. 2. It's a lot more fast paced, and it sounds like a mix of all of the songs on the album. All in all, other than a few low points, this a really good soundtrack.<br /><br />My Top 5 off of the album are...<br /><br />5) Back in Business<br /><br />4) He's a Man<br /><br />3) Something to Remember<br /><br />2) Sooner or Later<br /><br />1) Voguebum. All in all, other than a few low points, this a really good soundtrack. <br /> <br />My Top 5 off of the album are... <br /> <br />5) Back in Business <br />4) He's a Man <br />3) Something to Remember <br />2) Sooner or Later <br />1) Vogue
0800141601|3.0|Yes, it's King Arthur color-coordinated, and it's cheesy pretty much beyond belief.  Nonetheless, these cardboard characters are still fun to watch. And, from a literary perspective, it's kind of neat to see the film-makers take the trouble to include a cart a la Chretien de Troyes and the conflict between Logres (Arthur's England) and Gorre (the traditional land of the evil Meleagant -- here titled Malagant and made a former Knight of the blue formica Round Table). Yes, it's hard not to make fun of this movie -- well, maybe that's part of the pleasure. My guess: it's going to get even campier and more hilarious as time passes.
B000002LGQ|5.0|-Like a Prayer (1989)-<br /><br />Released back in 1989, this was really Madonna's first album to recieve as much critical success as it did commercial. And rightfully so. This is definitely one of Madonna's best albums. For me, it was one of those albums that I didn't like right away. I had to listen to it quite a few times before it all clicked. The album peaked at #1 in the US, and went on to sell over 4 million copies. The title track, is one of Madonna's most controversial singles, and has an amazing video to match. It's also one of my favorite Madonna songs of all time. It peaked at #1 in the US for 3 weeks, and was Madonna's first Platinum single. Other singles include \\"Express Yourself\\" \\"Cherish\\" (both of which peaked at #2 in the US, and are both really great songs), \\"Dear Jessie\\" (which wasn't released in the US, but peaked at #5 in the UK), \\"Keep it Together\\" (#8), and \\"Oh Father\\". \\"Oh Father\\" is another one of my all time favorite Madonna songs, and was the song that broke Madonna's long string of Top 5 hits in the US, only peaking at #20. It's an absolutely beautiful song though.<br /><br />1. Like a Prayer (10/10)<br /><br />2. Express Yourself (10/10)<br /><br />3. Love Song (9/10)<br /><br />4. Till Death Do Us Part (10/10)<br /><br />5. Promise to Try (10/10)<br /><br />6. Cherish (10/10)<br /><br />7. Dear Jessie (9/10)<br /><br />8. Oh Father (10/10)<br /><br />9. Keep It Together (9/10)<br /><br />10. Pray for Spanish Eyes (10/10)<br /><br />11. Act of Contrition (8/10)<br /><br />All of the unreleased songs are very good actually, especially \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\". It's amazing. It's very catchy and upbeat, but the lyrics are very dark and depressing. \\"Love Song\\", a duet with Prince, is a strange song. It's very good though. \\"Promise to Try\\" is a song about Madonna's late mother, who passed away when Madonna was only 5. It's a really sad song, and has even brought me to tears. \\"Pray for Spanish Eyes\\" is another amazing ballad, with a spanish flavour. \\"Act of Contrition\\" isn't even really a song. More like an interlude I guess. It's alright, but definitely not one of my favorites. All in all, this is definitely one of Madonna's best albums, and her best of the 80s.<br /><br />My Top off of the album are...<br /><br />5) Pray for Spanish Eyes<br /><br />4) Cherish<br /><br />3) Till Death Do Us Part<br /><br />2) Oh Father<br /><br />1) Like a Prayera song. More like an interlude I guess. It's alright, but definitely not one of my favorites. All in all, this is definitely one of Madonna's best albums, and her best of the 80s. <br /> <br />My Top off of the album are... <br /> <br />5) Pray for Spanish Eyes <br />4) Cherish <br />3) Till Death Do Us Part <br />2) Oh Father <br />1) Like a Prayer
B0006Z2LH4|2.0|It occurs to me that the previous reviewers have missed the point of Cube Zero. This is a comic book view of the idea.  Look at the control room with its wires and gizmos, two regular Joes doing their jobs in overalls and very dim lighting.  The Chess wiz gives away the comic book motif with his drawings of superheroes.  Mysterious overlords and archaic elevators mixed with ultra high tech killing devices inside the cube maze.  All that is missing are thought balloons and men in tights. <br /> <br />That said, I find it a step sideways, if not backwards.  Mixing various doses of Terry Gilliam, Batman, Twilight Zone and X Files, the resulting stew lacks the necessary hot sauce to satisfy the palate.  The ethical debate within the film is a stale distillation of George Orwell's dystopia Britain tinged with an Ayn Rand hangover.   <br /> <br />In short, it takes itself too seriously to be enjoyable. The characters within the Cube this time are paper thin; their duty is to die in grisly manners.  The two characters in the control room are fleshed out, yet superfluous.   <br /> <br />The ending is intended to tie into Cube itself, with thick layers of irony, but it was uncovnincing to me.  Overall, I find Cube 2 the best of the series (I know, I'm strictly in the minority on this view), Cube runs a tight second, and Cube Zero a distant third.  The inevitable 4th installment will have to go far deeper into the whys and wherefores of this strange America in order to keep the tale going.  I'll gladly stay tuned, no matter my distaste for this current episode.
B000002LND|5.0|-The Immaculate Collection (1990)-<br /><br />Released back in 1990, this was Madonna's first Greatest Hits albums. It includes some of her biggest hits from the 80s and very early 90s. It only made it to #2 in the US, but has sold over 10 million copies to date, and continues to be her biggest selling album 15 years later, usually selling anywhere between 3,000-4,000 a week. The album has \\"Crazy for You\\", a song that could only be found on single and the \\"Vision Quest\\" soundtrack. It was Madonna's 2nd #1 hit, and is one of my all time favorite Madonna ballads. It's absolutely beautiful. \\"Into the Groove\\", while not released in the US, hit #1 in the UK, and is definitely one of Madonna's best dance songs ever. The album also has two new songs, \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\". While \\"Rescue Me\\" is a great song, but to me, it can't compare to \\"Justify My Love\\", which is one of my all time favorite Madonna songs. The song was the one that started Madonna's infamous sex era. It's a very sexual song, and Madonna's spoken vocals are amazing. It was Madonna's third single to go Platinum. And the video to the song is one of the most controversial of all time, and is absolutely amazing. Filmed in black and white, it was a very sexual video, that caused a national uproar. It was banned from MTV, and released on VHS, and sold millions!<br /><br />1. Holiday (10/10)<br /><br />2. Lucky Star (10/10)<br /><br />3. Borderline (10/10)<br /><br />4.

0689865384|5.0|Pretty. Not just an adjective but a state of being. A world unto its own. A world entered on your sixteenth birthday.  <br /> <br />    The first book in an enticing new trilogy, Uglies by Scott Westerfeld catapults you into the high-tech future, a world separated by the uglies and the pretties. These people live in a society designed by the idea of a utopia, where everyone would be equal, happy, and most importantly to them, pretty. On the day of your sixteenth birthday the idea of getting a license is nonexistent, because that is the day of your operation. The day you leave Uglyville and move across the river to the party towers, to spend years doing nothing but have a really spectacular time. <br /> <br />    Tally, an ugly rapidly approaching her sixteenth birthday can't wait for the operation. She'll finally become just how she had always imagined herself to be as a pretty; or at least how she imagined to doctors would make her look. Being one of the only uglies her age left to turn, she's elated to become friends with Shay, another ugly that shares her exact birthday.  <br /> <br />    But Shay isn't sure if she wants to be pretty, and she'd rather risk leaving the world they know. After Shay runs away, the \\"specials\\" come looking for Tally. They know she can find this place called the \\"Smoke\\" where it's rumored many unwilling pretties-to-be escape to. They offer her an ultimatum; either she finds Shay and turns her in, or she'll never become a pretty. Shays faced with a decision that will alter her world forever, no matter which choice she makes.  <br /> <br /> This novel instantly captivated me into a world of high-tech gadgets and twisted views on how society should be maintained. It also got deep into personal morals and really makes you think about how your government or society can brainwash you into having certain beliefs that are so obviously absurd. It truly is one of the best books I have had the opportunity to read and I couldn't set it down foran instant. With its adventure and even a touch of romance it will instantly become a favorite of any reader. <br />
B000002NJS|5.0|-Ray of Light (1998)-<br /><br />Released back in 1998, this is the album that put Madonna back on top of the world. The past 2 years had been very busy for Madonna. She stared in the box office hit \\"Evita\\", which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and she also gave birth to her first child, daughter Lourdes. The album peaked at #2 in the US, where the only thing stopping it from going to #1 was the Titanic soundtrack, and has sold over 4 million copies to date. Not only did this album get some much deserved commercial success, it also got Madonna some of the best reviews of her career. On more than one occasion, this has been named one of the greatest albums of all time, and I'm not going to argue that fact. This album is definitely my favorite Madonna album, and one of my all time favorite albums. It also helped Madonna win her first Grammys. It took Madonna in an entirely new direction, which was electronica. The first single released from this album was \\"Frozen\\", which is my all time favorite Madonna song. The song is just amazing. It peaked at #2 in the US, giving Madonna her biggest hit in years. The video for \\"Frozen\\" is definitely one of the best ever. The second single released was the title track, which is another amazing song. Definitely one of the best dance songs Madonna has ever made, this song won Madonna quite a few Grammys, and the video is one of Madonna's best ever. Other singles released were \\"The Power of Goodbye\\", one of Madonna's all time greatest ballads, which peaked at #11 in the US, \\"Nothing Really Matters\\", which is another of Madonna's best dance songs, which peaked at a disappointing #93 in the US, and \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\", another great song, which wasn't released in the US, but managed to peak at #10 in the UK.<br /><br />1. Drowned World/Substitute for Love (10/10)<br />2. Swim (10/10)<br />3. Ray of Light (10/10)<br />4. Candy Perfume Girl (10/10)<br />5. Skin (10/10)<br />6. Nothing Really Matters (10/10)<br />7. Sky Fits Heaven (10/10)<br />8. Shanti/Ashtangi (10/10)<br />9. Frozen (10/10)<br />10. The Power of Goodbye (10/10)<br />11. To Have and Not to Hold (10/10)<br />12. Little Star (10/10)<br />13. Mer Girl (10/10)<br /><br />This is another one of the few albums that I own, where I would rate every song 10/10. \\"Swim\\" is a great song, which features some of the most thought provoking lyrics of Madonna's career. \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" is the rockiest song on the album, and it's just amazing. The beat and Madonna's vocals just fit together perfectly on this one. Definitely my favorite unreleased track. \\"Skin\\" is another one of my favorites, and is an amazing dance song that's almost haunting. \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" is another amazing song, and I just love the chorus. \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" is the weirdest song on the album, and a lot of people seem to hate it it, but I love it! I'm not sure what language Madonna is singing in, but it's very spiritual. \\"To Have and Not to Hold\\" is another great ballad, and the \\"ba ba da ba ba ba's\\" are my favorite parts of the song. \\"Little Star\\" is another one of my favorites, and is a song written for her daughter. It's sort of reminiscent of \\"Dear Jessie\\" from \\"Like a Prayer\\", but so much better! \\"Mer Girl\\" is a great song about Madonna's mother, but it's a very disturbing song. It makes me almost uncomfortable to listen to it. All in all, this is definitely Madonna's best album. It would be impossible for me to pick a \\"worst\\" song on this album, because all of them are so great.<br /><br />My Top 5 off the album are...<br /><br />5) The Power of Goodbye<br />4) Skin<br />3) Candy Perfume Girl<br />2) Ray of Light<br />1) Frozenhtangi (10/10)  9. Frozen (10/10)  10. The Power of Goodbye (10/10)  11. To Have and Not to Hold (10/10)  12. Little Star (10/10)  13. Mer Girl (10/10)    This is another one of the few albums that I own, where I would rate every song 10/10. \\"Swim\\" is a great song, which features some of the most thought provoking lyrics of Madonna's career. \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" is the rockiest song on the album, and it's just amazing.

B00003CXI1|1.0|Words Can't express just how aweful these movies are compared to the books.  I have been a Harry potter fan almost since the begining.  The books have and continue to be a beautiful source of inspiration for me.  But the films fall utterly short of even mediocre.  I understand that there must be changes when a book is adapted for film but too many vital complex characters, such as Hagrid and Ron, are reduced to one-dimensional comic relief.  Every character lost at least one-dimension - even harry.  I felt that if I hadn't read the book I probably wouldn't understand the movie. <br />Not is only a horrible adaptation, it is horrible as a film.  The actors feel as if they're either trying to hard, or don't know what they're doing.  Daniel Radcliff has to gasp before every line!  The corniness was almost too much to bear.  I felt embarressed for the actors. <br />The special effects sucked.  The troll in the girls bathroom should have at least  looked convincing.  The trees in the forbidden forest were too far apaart to be menacing. <br />I  will say though, that Argus Filch the caretaker was portrayed beautifully.  The one star I give this film is for him.
B0007O38F8|2.0|i expected this cd to not be as nice as any of the other stuff 50's put out, but idk this cd was exceptionally whack...just way too long and everything on it was filler...a few stand out tracks, but nothing to spend 15 bills on. but what's sad is this is gonna go about 5x platinum and some cats are gonna still say it was the best release of 2005

B0007O38F8|1.0|I WISH I COULD PLACE A -5 STARS BECAUSE THIS CD IS STRAIT GARBAGE. ID RATHER LISTEN TO KELLY CLARKSON INSTEAD OF THIS CRAP!!! ITS A GOOD THING THE GAME IS OUT OF THE GAY-UNIT HE'S BETTER OFF GOING SOLO.
B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Drive Your Car\\" does not belong on this album, it was not on the original US release, it is out of tune with the other songs on this serious adult album.<br /><br />My favorite song of all-time is \\"It's Only Love\\", which apparently was originally released in 60's-style on various album without concern about later-day consistency, but it belongs on \\"Rubber Soul\\" because of the music and lyrics, it is adult and is revelant to my own marriage, so I love it, \\"Rubber Soul\\" as a whole is an adult document on the relationships of men and women (well I suppose politically correctly I should say people and people).<br /><br />Afterwards in the Sgt Pepper/White Album/Abbey Road days The Beatles talked about cosmic stuff,  not so much about marital relationships.
0060763280|1.0|Right off the bat Eker gives bad advice.  The best way to become wealthy is not to save or educate yourself or study the stock market. No, the easiest method is giving seminars to desperate folks and writing schlock like this.  Degree, investments and skills are optional.  <br /> <br />This book is so bad it is almost good and if you are serious about literature or prose you are barking up the wrong tree.  I have a deep aversion to tomes of this type, you know the ones that claim some \\"secret\\" pathway to wealth and then are purposely vague so as to avoid any legal ramifications.  Yet someone lent me a copy and in my spare time I gave it a quick once over.  I'll even admit, to my utmost humiliation, that a long time ago I attended one of those crappy seminars where a cheerleader got all the poor fools excited about swimming in cash. <br /> <br />The author, probably president of his high school pep club, delivers the goods in that it is exactly like all the 19 zillion other books similar to this, only with an expanded group of \\"experts\\" cited. As one reviewer notes, they are cited endlessly, either with or without quotes. It goes without saying that there is nothing original here - no secret formula, hidden meaning or a jump start on the journey to success.  The name says it all, the \\"Inner Game\\".  People like this view wealth accumulation as a \\"game\\" (God save us from these endless sports metaphors) that must be played by rugged all-American men (and women they hastily  add). <br /> <br />There IS no mindset that leads to wealth except one that values hard work, discipline, education and the capacity to take risks. And despite protests, I can only think that this was one long advertisement for his seminars.  It is amazing the money that Joe and Jane fork over for someone to tell them they need to save, cut expenses and make better investments.  I am normally against forcing labels on products but in this case I will make an exception.  \\"WARNING, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH\\".
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This is pure, unadulturated metal. It's harsh, loud, fast, and angry. To those who think Vol. 3 Subliminal Versus, or even Iowa, was hard, they need to listen to Slipknot's self-titled album. If you're not familiar with Slipknot, they are a group of 9 extremely talented artists. Although they may appear to have a stereotypical stigma of hatred and anger (which is present), they go much deeper than that. Their lyrics go much deeper than just fighting and killing, as the songs have great philosophical and political meanings (believe me or not). Their self-titled album is not the coming-of-age album Vol. 3 Subliminal Versus thuogh, and doesnt have the level of maturity Vol. 3 has. Consider that, as I've said previously, that Slipknot goes well beyond their anger stigma. <br />The album starts off with \\"742617000027.\\" The number is the barcode from Slipknot's first album M.F.K.R. (which stands for Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat. Note that 7 of the 9 band members in their first titled album were involved in M.F.K.R, as ). The whole song is someone saying \\"I think its sick,\\" as it talks about a Charles Manson documentary. Then the album gets more serious with \\"(Sic).\\" The song is rather simple in theory, but is really a much more complicated piece. (Sic) shows what Slipknot's metal is. If you're into heavy music, it's great. The album shifts to an even more serious song \\"Eyel Ess,\\" which was inspired by the band seeing a man yelling around saying \\"you cant see california without marlin brando's eyes!\\" but the song is also about Corey's (the lead singer) father. Probably the most popular song from the album, \\"Wait and Bleed,\\" is less tense but still kicks a**. It seems more melodic, and has a more fluid rythm, but in my opinion its not as good as \\"(Sic)\\" or \\"(Prosthetics).\\" One of my favorites comes up next, \\"Sur Facing,\\" which starts off which a high-pitch guitar riff, then comes down to the melodic hard metal that Slipknot is known for. It's a great song.  <br />Next comes \\"Spit it Out,\\" which would seem to be their rap inspired song. I wouldnt really say that it is rap inspired, and just because Corey flows like no one else out there doesnt mean its rap. Or does it? Be the judge. Back to the manner, its another great song, and mixes Corey's great vocal talents with that great Slipknot rythm. \\"Tattered & Torn\\" is one of those tortured and psychologically damaged songs, as the title explains what the song is like, but it is a good song nonetheless. \\"Me Inside\\" is another fast and angry song, and isnt one of my favorites from the album, but its still a good song. The album goes through songs like \\"Liberate\\" and \\"Diluted\\" which continues that hard, fast, and thrashing Slipknot sound. Songs like \\"No Life,\\" and \\"Only One\\" continue the rap-core sound mixed with the metal sound and rythm (like in Spit it Out). \\"Get This\\" does the same, but I would say its definatly the weak point of the album because it is really a pointless song in my opinion, and you get a chance to read the lyrics without hearing the song it will probably make you laugh (not because the lyrics are purposefully funny). But \\"Get This\\", as with every other song, has strong meaning, as it is about how screwed up and sold-out the music industry is. \\"Prosthetics\\" takes the thrashing sound to a more refined and mature level. It isnt as hard or fast as the other songs, and is really all the better for it (not saying the hard and fast songs arent good, as they are very good). \\"Scissors\\" is one of the best songs they ever did, but is also probably the most emotional and tortured. Some compare the emotional level of this song with Korn's \\"Daddy,\\" which is in my opinion the most emotional rock/metal song ever made (that along with \\"Kill You\\" which was also made by Korn).  <br />With the Digipak album, there's the 5 extra songs, which include Spit it Out (Hyper Version, it is an even faster version), Wait and Bleed (Terry Date remix, which I would say is superior to the regular version),Interloper and Despise (both album demos made in '98), and Sur Facing (Live. ALL of Slipknot's live songs are AS good or BETTER than the recording songs, which go to show how talented these artists are. Remember that there are NO studio added effects in Slipknot's music, it is all made by Slipknot alone).  <br />Overall, Slipknot's self-titled is very strong, as it is their heaviest album to date. It may not be as mature as Vol. 3 Subliminal Versus, but it's superior to both Vol. 3 and Iowa in my opinion. Plus, Joey (the main percussionist) doesnt show off his skills in Vol. 3. Hey, Joey was voted to be the best percussionist of the 1990s, and in my opinions kills every other drummer out there today with no problem. Slipknot is an extremely talented band that goes beyond their \\"nu-metal\\" or \\"thrash-metal\\" stigma. Slipknot is the best metal band of the 1990s and 2000s.  <br />1. 742617000027- 8/10 <br />2. (Sic)- 9.5/10 <br />3. Eyel Ess- 9/10 <br />4. Wait and Bleed- 9.5/10 <br />5. Sur Facing- 10/10 <br />6.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I will admit that this is a film I had decided to hate based upon the hype surrounding it and the insipid title.  Yet I persevered and was aptly rewarded with a scintillating performance by all concerned and in particular Uma Thurman who, as a bride, was brutally beaten while her groom was being murdered.  And what a beating it was - kick, pow, bam!! In fact, throughout the movie, one can't decide if it is a comedy, mystery, farce, drame  or arte nouveau.   <br /> <br />I remain ambiguous about Quentin Tarantino as a director but in this film he delivers the goods.  The comic book presentation was another \\"juvenile\\" element that worked perfectly, the fights a combination Matrix, Bruce Lee and Live Studio Wrestling. (The Oriental sword scene made me want to stand and cheer.) What WAS important were the things left unsaid: Why the horrific beating?  What about the child?  What was her past? For heaven's sake, what's her friggin name???  (Or did I miss that?) Of course  the ending sets us up for Episode II in which our Supergirl / Jane Bond delivers an licking that won't stop.  But that's for another review.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|Aphex Twin (Richard D. James) is known for many things. He is known for making great ambient music, as he has showed his talent at making ambient music in several of his albums and singles. His first full-ambient album is a success, and shows his mastery of ambient music. I have to admit, it isnt his best album, but it is great. Strangely enough, many of the songs, such as \\"Actium,\\" \\"Ptolemy,\\" and \\"Pulsewidth\\" take on a dance sound that, despite what many people say, is rather rare in Richard D. James' music. But he still does a good job, as even the dance-sounding songs sound great.  <br />1. Xtal- 10/10- A very beautiful piece. Blends ambient with the dance sounds that surprisingly is abundant in this album. Probably the best song on this album. <br />2. Tha- 9/10- Definatly more ambient sounding than some of the other tracks on this album. Broad and probably boaring to some people, it is still a great song. But hey, thats what ambient electronica is. Broad, sometimes boaring in some ways, but very rewarding in the end. <br />3. Pulsewidth- 9/10- If Aphex Twin released a dance-oriented album, this track would be on it. It's not overly dancy, as it has a blend of that slower ambient attitude. <br />4. Ageispolis- 10/10- Sounds like a mixture of Autechre's \\"Lowride\\" and Pulsewidth. Ambient mixed with a hip-hop beat. It's made by Richard D. James, so it's great. <br />5. I- 9/10- Slow and progressive. It's definatly an ambient song. Once again, may be boaring to some, but is very rewarding in the end. <br />6. Green Calx- 8/10- Probably the most active song in the album. Strange noises, catchy beats, ect.  <br />7. Heliosphan- 10/10- One of my favorites. A true mix of ambient and dance techno. End result-a involving song that lets your mind float freely. Not something to dance to, but something to sit down and think to. A little more ambient than dance, and all the better for it. <br />8. We Are the Music Makers- 9/10- It begins with Gene Wilder saying \\"We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams.\\" Then for seven minutes it travels on and on with good beats and an ambient attitude. A good song, not the best but not the worst. <br />9. Schottkey 7th Path- 8/10- Finally, another ambient song! Like the others, its long, broad, sometimes boaring, but rewarding in the end.  <br />10. Ptolemy- 7.5/10- Takes the hip-hop beats of Ageispolis and adds some cheesy hip-hop sound effects, then cheesy techno effects. But it's better than it sounds.  <br />11. Hedphelym- 8/10- Another ambient song, but with a twist. This song has a distorted, high piece noise in the front while having a bursting bass sound in the back. It's interesting, but not the high point of the CD. <br />12. Delphium- 8.5/10- Like Ptolemy, it has that hip-hop beat, but to a lesser extent. There's some ambient sounds added in there, as well as some techno sounds added in there. Overall its a good song, but once again not the stongest song. <br />13. Actium- 10/10- Actium is dance meets ambient (again). It makes for a great mix. <br /> <br />Overall I was surprised by the dance/hip-hop theme that Selected Ambient 85-92 brought me, but in the end it was a very rewarding experience. I would say Xtal is definatly the strongest song of the album, and is on the list of those beautiful masterpieces Aphex Twin has been able to come up with during the past few decades of his music making career.  <br /> <br />Strongest song- Xtal <br />Weakest Song- Probably Ptolemy.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I have moved from initially hating the very idea of the movie to loving the first one and now absolutely adoring this concluding film. This is one of the rare instances where the sequel topped its predecessor.  We all know what happened in Volume I so are more prepared this time.  Tarantino uses a past/future approach, providing the historical perspective mission in the first.   <br /> <br />We return to the beginning when Uma is accepted into the corp of Bad Guys, her training with the Oriental master, her relationship with David Carradine (I use the person not the persona) and others.  Switch to the present and she begins her revenge only to be caught and buried alive.  This is only a brilliant segue into training from an Oriental master which comes to her aid.   <br /> <br />The scene with housewife Vivica Fox scored on so many levels, not the least of which was black humor.  But it is Darryl Hannah who nearly steals the show with an incredible performance as the amoral Elle.  Her stumbling, earnest recitation of snake facts from scrawled notes as poor Michael Madsen dies of venom was the stuff of legends.  And how better to follow it up than a fight with Uma in which Elle is left blind, her only companion the viper...absolutely skin-crawling. <br /> <br />But it is the interaction with Carradine (and the daughter) that is the icing on the cake, Carradine, by the way, seems almost made to order for the part of \\"Bill\\".  Not seen in Part I, he is almost likeable in his matter-of-fact evil incorrigibility.  The film comes full circle as she dispatches her arch enemy/lover using techniques taught by the Oriental master.  Bravo!
B000001OAA|3.0|I heard they were releasing a new album some time soon but have yet to hear any details. Oh well,.... <br /> <br />Garbage was a great punk/pop/rock band (much like No Doubt except ND doesn't take themselves as seriously as Garbage). This cd was a great punk/pop/rock cd, the highlight obviously being Only Happy When it Rains.  <br /> <br />When I first heard the song I couldn't believe how sexy the vocal was. Then I saw the woman singing it and couldn't believe how uniquely sexy she was. Shirley's vocals on Milk and Queer are even sexier.  <br /> <br />Gwen Stefani is most often compared to Debbie Harry but personally I think Shirley Manson was much more Harry, vocally. Debbie had an odd sexy/haunting voice -- traits that Shirley shares. Stefani has more of a Madonna/Minnie Mouse voice (which isn't neccessarily bad -- I'm a Stefani fan). <br /> <br />I'm going to go against the tide and give Stupid Girl a slightly negative review. I'm just not a fan of the song probably because I don't find it remotely interesting.  <br /> <br />All in all a really catchy (and hugely successful) debut album. <br /> <br />
B00005QZWI|5.0|I bought this music after watching the movie because the music was so smooth and relaxing to listen to. I find listening to the music helps to alleviate stress, and will remind you of that great part of the story. <br /> <br />Even if you didn't like the movie or the book, this soundtrack is a must buy, it's beauty must be heard and remembered by everyone.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I give this disc credit for the sound quality. However, I just don't understand these #1 collections. Greatest Hits collections are so much better for the consumer. There are many great Beatles songs that never reached #1 (and in some cases weren't even released as singles) that are just as memorable if not more than some of their actual #1's. <br /> <br />Save your money. Buy the Anthologies or the Beatles' Greatest Hits collection.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|The definitive version of Sally Bowles, the original Christopher Isherwood's 1939 book about life in Pre War II in Berlin. Liza Minelli proved she could act better than her mother (Judy Garland) . Minelli made a bravura performance and the inspired rapture of Bob Fosse makes of this film an absolute must to acquire it.
B00005QDW1|4.0|The problem with ND's albums is that it takes a while for me to really like them. There are only a few ND songs I actually like upon initially hearing them (some examples being SKOL, Bathwater, Just a Girl, and UIA).  <br /> <br />The first time I heard Hey Baby it was at the end of an episode of Making the Video on MTV, so I also had a visual to go with the song. I absolutely HATED it. I thought it was so pop, and although ND has a history of making catchy songs, this was a little too commercial for my tastes. However, I saw the band perform the song live on SNL and it grew on me. The exact same thing happened with Hella Good. I loathed it but then saw them perform it live at the Grammys and loved it. It even encouraged me to go out and buy the whole cd. <br /> <br />Rock Steady was a sweet opening to the cd, however, I don't think Hey Baby should have followed it chronologically. Perhaps the band wanted it to be one of the firsts on the cd because it was the first single but I don't think sound-wise it was a smart move. <br /> <br />Songs I liked: Hella Good, UIA, Running, Start the Fire, Don't Let Me Down <br /> <br />Songs I didn't like: Making Out, In My Head, and Waiting Room. I think they should have left one of the those three off the cd and instead put New Friend in it's place. I think the sound and vibe of New Friend goes a lot better with the sound and vibe with the rest of the songs on this cd. <br /> <br />ND usually has a look to go with their albums (much like Duran Duran) and Rock Steady was no acception. However, it looks like they put more effort into their clothes then they did the actual songs and album artwork.

However I can say that this book gives a very good account of history on one of the most diffcult mathematical problem and leaves you all inspired for the effort & ingenuity of the men and women in history who attempted to solve this...and also who actually made it. Very good indeed...
B00006879E|1.0|\\"Songs About Jane\\" is Maroon 5's first album, and it will also be their last.  This boy band that appeared out of nowhere will also get nowhere with this \\"album\\", even though almost every song has become a single.  This worthless trash is enough to scare the living daylights out of anything, even an inanimate object.  Try placing a rock in front of the speaker while you play this album.  It will grow legs, jump up and run out of the room.  It is songs like \\"This Love\\" and \\"She Will Be Loved, \\"Must Get Out\\", and \\"Tangled\\" that make this CD the junk pile it is.  Monotonous drumbeats, false guitar playing, and their goddarned \\"keyboardist\\" go to show that people in the music industry will fall for anything to turn into a CD.  I would also like to add that it remains a mystery why good bands, including little local garage bands do not have record deals.  I have a feeling it is because they are not like Moron 5, and have the sense not to get involved with this.  I wish that Songs About Lame would go away, and take Whoreoon 5 with them. <br /> <br />If you rated this review helpful, put it in your signature.  Songs About Jane haters unite!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have been monitoring the discussions on this movie for some time now. I originally heard about how original and inspired the conversation had become a few years ago in a local bullitin. That all seems to have died down. <br /> <br />I am an old Hollywood insider. I did production work in the 50s and 60s. Things have changed but some things have not. I am fascinated by the discussion of religion and eastern mysticism and what not. My master agreed with most of it actually. <br /> <br />My problem is that no one is talking about how this movie plays with time and nostaglia. Very basically, it is an attempt to clothe nostaglia in new sounds and costumes. We are taken back in time and it seems like we're there for the first time. That is a technique that is done very well and not often discussed. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time.
B0002OERI0|1.0|American Idiot is a perfect description of <br />a. The people who consider this trash \\"music\\" <br />b. Green Day's dope-smoking, sex-hungry members who are getting much to old to do things like this. <br /> <br />Back in 1991, Green Day released their first album, \\"1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\".  This album wasn't exactly what you would call perfect, but it was only their first try.  A year later, the sophemore album, \\"Kerplunk\\" was released.  This was about the same, with a remake of My Generation on it. <br />Next, Green Day pushed themselves onto top 40 radio with Dookie.  The re-release of \\"Welcome To Paradise\\" was already a sign that they were running out of ideas. <br />As the music continued going downhill from there, we reach 2001, when Green Day released the highly anticipated \\"Warning\\".  When I first bought this album, I couldn't believe this was the same Green Day, when I listened to songs like \\"Blood Sex an Booze\\", \\"Misery\\" and \\"Macy's Day Parade\\".  Sad to face it, I must say Green Day had sold out.  A year later, Green Day released a greatest hits album.  They had gone too far.  Now they were no longer a rock band, but an overpowering industry. <br />Which leads me to September 21, 2004 when Green Day released American Idiot.  I was very reluctant to buy this new album, fearing it would be a letdown just like \\"Warning\\".  However, when a friend of mine played \\"Holiday\\" for me, this drove me to making a big mistake: Buying American Idiot.  I couldn't believe it.  9 and a half minute storylines, slow songs, and Boulevard of Broken Dreams, perhaps the most overplayed song in the history of the world. <br />Songs like \\"Are We The Waiting\\" and \\"Wake Me When September Ends\\" will put anybody to sleep, even if they are on steroids and have just finished 2 gallons of Turkish coffee.  The monotonous tune, repeated drum beat and irksome singing will make anybody want to scream. <br />I never did appreciate the lyrics of Green Day songs, but in this album, BilleJoe is singing babyish, annoying stuff, and trying to use curse words to make him look punk.  A song with a title like \\"Give Me Novicaine\\" is a sign that a band is going downhill.  I think I'll need novicaine to cure my bleeding ears. <br /> <br />In conclusion, American Idiot is yet another overhyped pop album that only little teenage girls will enjoy.  Please do your ears a favor and do not buy this album. <br />If you do, however buy it, please note it is too small to use as a frisbee, too dull to be a pizza cutter, and smells too bad to use as an air freshener.  About the only thing it is good for is clogging up the toilet.
B00005JMUA|5.0|This movie had double the fun , gore , action , and plot of vol. 1 and I thought it was excellent. Hellz Yeah.
B00005QK3B|1.0|I have been a fan of surrealistic Marillion music for more than 20 years. I especially enjoyed the early releases. However it puzzles me why any fan would rate this compilation \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" by more than one star, if any. I purchased it without looking at its track titles, only to discover repeated tracks in a two-disc, pricey CD set. Out of 20 songs in the set, 15 are repeatitions, two of them are recorded three times!!! This is  unacceptable and I would say, shows lack of respect for fans who buy the CDs.  <br />Yes I love Marillion music, but I'd rather use my stereo player to replay my favorite tracks as many times as I want. The repeated tracks in this CD set are slightly different but this is not a good justification and there is no value for money here, especially at a price of $19.99 plus shipping. I do not recommend this CD set. You're better off buying the original releases, or pay $0.99 to download each individual song.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This is one of my all time faves. I loved the war scenes and had to follow this flick because it is gripping.
0689865384|5.0|Uglies is a wonderful book. Its about a girl named Tally, and she lives in a futristic society. In this society on your 16th birthday everyone has a surgery that turns you supermodel gorgeous. Everyone else who hasn't turned 16 is ugly. Uglies live in seperate cities and count the days untill they can be pretty, well... almost everyone does. Tally's new friend Shay doesn't want to be pretty and generic, so she runs away to join other who don't want to be pretty. The \\"specials\\" know Shay has run away, and that she isn't the only one. The Specials know they run away to a place called Smoke only they don't know where it is. They offer Tally a choice, help them find Smoke, and betray her friend, or never become pretty, ever. Tally wants to be pretty, how can anyone not want to be a \\"pretty\\"? You get to party all the time with no responsibilties. When Tally goes in search of Shay, she finds a whole new side to her world, and find out something improtant that the \\"specials\\" have been trying to keep secret. When you have the opperation to become beautiful, they don't just change your looks.  <br /> <br />This book is wonderful! It really makes you think about the cost of beauty. Uglies reminds me of the The Giver. It is really good. It makes you think about how a society can brainwash you into thinking that your not good enough. Uglies has action, adveture, its science fiction so if you like that genre you've got your technology fix, but if you aren't really intereseted in that genre it doesn't matter because the book has a much deeper meaning. Also girls, their is a little bit of romance spliced in. Check it out, you'll love it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is a bounce back from Jackie Brown and why it wasn't as good as pulp fiction the movie is so cool and I really really thought it was just an entertaining and fun flick.
0784011206|4.0|Rambo 2 seems to get the most attention, but I've always thought that the original First Blood was the best of the Rambo movies.<br /><br />In the latter two movies, Rambo sort of became a super hero. There's nothing wrong with that, but in the first movie he was more of a regular person who was dealing with extreme circumstances. I think that's one of the main reasons I prefer this one over the sequels.<br /><br />Stallone is often underrated as an actor. He gives a great performance in this movie. Also very good are Brian Dennehey and Richard Crenna.<br /><br />Even though First Blood is now over twenty years old, it still holds up very well and is definitely worth watching.
B00000J2KX|5.0|I loved this movie and thought it was a great horror movie. Just absolutely perfect.
B00000490M|5.0|Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) , has just moved with his mom from New Jersey to California, and has trouble fitting in. He is being mercilessly victimized by the local gang of Karate champs-the all blonde Germanic looking Cobra Kais, while he romances bubbly blond Ali Mills (Elizabeth Shue) who happens to be the ex-girlfriend of cobra lead-boy Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).<br />He is rescued from the Cobras by the caretaker of his block of flats, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) who just happens to be a karate expert. After Mr. Miyagi enters Danny in the local Karate championship where he will be pitted against Johnny and the Cobras who are trained to be ruthless by their psycopathic trainer John Creese (Martin Kove), it is all about Danny's training to win the tournament, and to win the girl-Ali.<br /><br />Beautifully done , I loved the 80's atmosphere and the 80's music. I first saw it when I was 12 , and watching it again recently brought all the memories flooding back!
B00005UW9T|5.0|This is a classic movie.  Yes, \\"classic\\" has been overused by Disney, but I want you to know that this IS a TRUE classic.  It's right up there with Snow White.      The animation was so astounding I can't even attempt to put it in words.  The 3D and 2D mesh isn't as good in some places as one would like it to be, but (a) it was 1997 and (b) we still can't pull it off now in 2005!  If this isn't amazing animation, then what IS?    The music was as good or (dare I even say it?) possibly even BETTER than the animation.  \\"Once Upon a December\\" is just.......  It's useless to describe it.  Words cannot express how mysterious and haunting and amazing and joyous and creepy and astounding every second of listening to it is.  The rest of the songs, while not quite as good, are still enjoyable.    And the writing...Oh, the writing was fantastic.  To those of you who wanted a historically accurate Anastasia, I have two words for you: TOUGH BEANS.  Did you REALLY expect a historically accurate Anastasia.  and besides, the rest of the movie is so amazing that you HAVE to just let it go.  Every scene was exactly what it was supposed to be--take the dream sequence.  It was SO darn creepy seeing the reality played against what was happening in Anya's mind, it was just-----insane.  Completely and totally IN-SANE!  DO YOU HEAR ME! ALL OF IT IS COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE AND POWERFUL AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!!!!!    Bottom line:  If you are an inhabitant of our universe (preferably above age 5, but that's okay too), you should watch this movie.

B00066N8JS|5.0|By looking at this CD set I'm sure you're aware of what a masterpiece TDS is. This is an absolute must for any hardcore nin fan with a high end stereo system. The 5.1 support adds another dimension to an already revolutionary work. The bonus material is up to par with any other Reznor remix album. The cover of 'Dead Souls' is amazing and I'm very surprised it didn't make the cut on the final album. With this collection TR immortalized this album.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I did not really know Anastacia's music until recently. A few weeks ago I saw her in concert in Slovenia and was just amazed at the voice, the music and the fantastic person behind it all. I bought this CD and have listened to it constantly ever since. It is a really great piece of work! I especially enjoy sick-n-tired and heavy on my heart.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|<br />\\"This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon.\\" <br />\\"I know.\\" <br />\\"What do we do?\\" <br />\\"Enjoy it.\\" <br /> This dialogue between the two main characters of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel and Clementine, played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet could apply to how I felt watching this movie just as easily as it does the fleeting memories of their romance.  Kaufman has delivered a screenplay that fits in with his style, as seen in Adaptation and the other film he did with director Michel Gondry, Human Nature.  It's creative, challenging, and the there are a lot of voice-overs, any fan of his work could tell this is Kaufman's work, and probably his best, thanks in large part to the directorial work of Michel Gondry.  This Film is completely original while being an exceptionally enjoyable theatre experience. <br /> Eternal Sunshine is a love story, but a very unconventional one.  Joel and Clementine, the two in the relationship, have a bitter break up.  Clementine, in an impulsive act of anger gets her memories of Joel erased.  When Joel discovers this through a mutual friend (played by the great David Cross) he decides to do the same, frustrated by not being remembered by the woman he still loves.  During the procedure Joel realizes he does not want these memories of Clementine erased, much of the film takes place in the mind and memories of Joel.  While he is reliving the memories of his time with Clementine he realizes he doesn't want to erase her and struggles unsuccessfully to save his memories by hiding within his mind.  Although for a time it appears that they might end up together even afterwards, they then learn of their history together and Clementine decides to not pursue another relationship with Joel. <br /> Kaufman has written some great screenplays before but this is the first time it has really resulted in an exceptionally great and accessible film.  For this he can thanks his maturation as a writer as well as the great directorial work of Michelle Gondry.  This is their second film together, the first being the mediocre Human Nature, which was ambitious but just didn't work.  Gondry really captured Kaufmans screenplay on the second try, in a way even Kaufman's other director of choice, Spike Jonze, has so far been unable to.  Obviously, Eternal Sunshine, was a much stronger script then, Human Nature, but it was as difficult to create in film as any of Kaufman's work.  Gondry, who has much more experience in mainstream American music videos (imdb.com) then films, did an amazing job of capturing this story.  The scenes in Joel's mind while it was being erased were incredibly creative.  Gondry is exceptionally talented at using light in his shots and shows off his ability in the shots where Joel's memories are being erased.  He uses a spotlight to show the part of the memory that Joel still remembers while putting the rest in darkness.  This is much more effective at showing Joel's rapidly deteriorating mind then any expensive special effects could be.  He also uses bird's eye shots to show Joel's powerlessness against the erasing that is taking place despite his desire to stop it.  Gondry shows off his impressive directorial skills in this film and hopefully it will open the door for him to do many more films. <br /> The acting of Eternal Sunshine is also phenomenal.  Kate Winslet delivers her usual outstanding performance, this time in a great role, which makes her even more impressive.  Most famous for her role in the Titanic, Winslet has appeared in many films, most recently in Finding Neverland alongside Johnny Depp.  A great performance was not a surprise, even expected from an actress of her caliber.  Jim Carrey's performance on the other hand was not as expected.  Carrey is best known for his zany roles in comedies such as Dumb and Dumber, The Cable Guy, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.  He has attempted a serious role before in Man on the Moon, the story of Andy Kaufman (imdb.com) and TheMajestic.  The actor that played Joel in Eternal Sunshine can not possibly be the same guy who was in The Majestic!  Well it seems Jim Carey's dream of being a good actor, or at least giving a good performance has finally come true.  Either he really got better since The Majestic in 2001 or he got fed up and sold his soul to the devil in return for the ability to act.  Carey's really good in this film and his unusual comedic personality works well for him in his role as Joel, who himself feels out of place at times.  While you can usually see Carey as the ultimate extrovert in his usual roles, Joel is completely introverted and this makes the performance even more impressive.  Carey of course didn't get an Academy Award, which was unfortunately expected, but he did do a great job and I would love to see him in a serious role again if he could deliver a performance as good as he did in Eternal Sunshine. <br /> Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a great film.  Kaufman has always written great films, but they have never resulted in a film as accessible as this one.  Gondry does a great job in creating the world in Joel's head, where much of the film takes place.  His creativity as a filmmaker is unusual and should be embraced.  I enjoyed this film  tremendously, its probably my favorite and it really reveals something else every time it is watched, so I recommend seeing it multiple times.
0792846443|5.0|Misery is a peak in King's ability to write amazing thrillers and thus in the right hands we might have a good film, so lucky for us that the director of \\"Stand by Me\\" did this one also, much like The Dead Zone, there is not a lot of horror here, going for the psychological frights, everyone including James Caan scores in aces with this #1 fan gone on the rampage via the form of Anne the wrestling nurse who drugs up the missing writer Paul Sheldon after finding him a car crash, very few characters, mostly just the two, suspend this book till the final shell-shocked writer flashback syndrome, Misery just shows how crazy good King is at his craft. It is also one of his best books and although this is a great movie, you should READ MISERY.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|How can any reviewer, except someone with a vested interest in the film's financial well being, give this tripe anything other than the minimum of one star. The story was historically inaccurate and why, oh why, did the entire film have to revolve around the hero's homosexual tendencies? I, and the majority of the people watching this film, physically moaned out loud when the most mundane of moments had to evolve into highlighting his propensity for sexual partners of the same sex. It was addressed over and over and over ad nauseum. What a waste of time, money and extreme talent.
B000002MP2|3.0|I will admit it. This was the second cd I ever purchased and I loved it. This album opened the door to punk music for me. Shortly after I bought albums from Rancid, Bad Religion, and the Offspring (Not bad for a 9 year old kid whose only connection to the 90's punk rock scene was MTV and alternative radio.) I eventually got sick of this cd and gave it away. 11 years later I feel I can review this cd properly. Overall, it is a catchy pop punk record. There is nothing groundbreaking here, the reason it got the hype it did is because it brought pop punk into the mainstream and launched a million pop punk copycat careers. (The riff in the middle of Basket Case has been tweaked and warped to create thousands of generic pop punk songs by thousands of generic pop punk bands)I eventually grew out of my pop punk phase and started listening to bands with a little creativity and talent aka 311 which is directed to the idiot 11 year old who posted the last review. Oh yeah, dummy, don't talk crap on Unwritten Law because they were at their prime before you were born. You want a classic pop punk record then by Dude Ranch by Blink. There's an album that will never get old. Peace
B00000IAU3|5.0|It's no news to anyone that Dido was shot out of relative obscurity into worldwide fame when Eminem used a portion of her song 'Thank You' in his huge hit 'Stan'. However, she should not be pushed aside and thought of only as \\"that girl who sang a couple lines in a pretty good rap song\\". Dido is an amazing talent, and definitely deserves all the publicity and success she receives. If you're a fan of amazing lyrics, genuine beauty, and simple - though still amazing - music, 'No Angel' is not an album to pass up. A voice that is beautiful, pure, and soulful all in one, helps to set Dido apart for the crowd of other \\"pop-stars\\" her age. She also has true talent (which is oftentimes quite rare in the music industry), which can be adored by music lovers of all kinds. She writes as though she has experienced life from many perspectives, and it seems impossible to doubt that she has when listening to any of her lyrics. <br /> <br />The album begins with 'Here With Me'. It starts out softly, and sets a calm, although dark and mysterious, mood. When Dido's vocals come in, they suit the music perfectly. Her tone is eerily beautiful and soft, and the emotion she evokes makes it sound as though she's explaining something to the listener. After about one minute and 20 seconds, the drums really kick in and speed the song up. However, Dido's vocals remain gentle and her pace stays the same. 'Hunter' is unquestionably a standout track off of 'No Angel'. One of my personal favourites, Dido's vocals begin mere milliseconds before the music kicks in. The acoustic guitar guides listeners through the first verse before the other instruments are introduced at the beginning of the bridge. The vocals on this track are absolutely beautiful. They're not flawless, which (frankly) is what makes them so amazing. Dido's voice is extremely distinct and smooth, which makes her a radio favourite. There are some amazing notes Dido hits at the end of the song which really help to finish it off with abang.  <br /> <br />'Don't Think Of Me' was considered the worst track on 'No Angel' by most critics, but I really enjoy it. I'd say this is probably the \\"angriest\\" Dido song I've heard thus far. From the very first line (\\"So you're with her/And not with me\\"), we can hear the bitterness in the vocals. With no attempt to cover her resentment up, Dido really wears her heart and her anger on her sleeve in this track. I find it's this honesty about her emotions which helps to make it a standout on the album. The vocals are very drawn out in the chorus, which adds depth and intensity to the song. About halfway through the song, it slows down and is kept together simply with vocals and the occasional drumbeat, before speeding up again. It then moves into an instrumental break where the listener can hear livid muttering in the background if they listen closely. The drums really speed up before just falling off to complete the song magnificently. The CD slows down quite significantly with 'My Lover's Gone'. It opens with spine-chilling music, and Dido's eerie vocals sound ghostlike and haunting. I really love the drums throughout this song, and Dido's voice throughout this entire track is amazing as well. The fact that she can sound so strong and powerful whilst also giving off a fragile, weak impression is astounding.  <br /> <br />'All You Want' begins with innocent, simple vocals. This is an extremely sincere and heart wrenching track. In it, Dido calls out to an ex-lover, attempting to convince him that she's all that he wants and needs. I find that it's sad at first as she's broken and willing to forgive him for cheating and abandoning her. However, nearing the end of the track, Dido gains an extra bit of strength and confidence, suddenly changing the tone of the song and making herself into the powerful one. 'Thank You' was the song Eminem sampled for his huge hit 'Stan', and it went on to become a huge hit on it's own as well. It starts out loosely and beautifully with what sounds like bongos before the piano, drums, and guitar come in, and then Dido jumps in with her vocals. Her voice is soft and naive, while also possessing intensity and sexiness. This is a stunning and modest love song. Completely void of pretension and fussiness, it's the simplicity of the track that makes it so genuine and heartwarming. 'Honestly OK' has an absolutely stunning introduction. This song is undoubtedly a very instrumental track. Dido's voice is soft, sad, and distant, which adds to the dark mood of the song. This song could be described as a delicate, deeply emotional track. There are no huge musical or vocal surprises, but it works and makes this poignant song unforgettable.  <br /> <br />'Slide' begins softly with a piano and then bongos. Throughout the first verse, Dido's vocals are almost too soft to hear before they slowly gain command. By the time the first chorus comes in, her vocals are at the height of their power, demanding complete and utter authority over the song. Nearing the end of the song, the music gains speed, and Dido's voice becomes very throat-y and haunting. My personal favourite song on 'No Angel' is 'Isobel'. With deep drums and flawless vocals, this is a stunning track. The tone of the lyrics suit the accompanying music perfectly. Both are filled with remorse, hope, and guidance. Nearing the end of the song, a harmonica kicks in silently. It's actually so quiet that one probably wouldn't even notice it was being played if they weren't listening for it. Dido's last line in the song ends with just a whisper, and she barely even finishes it before the music starts to fade away to end the song gorgeously.  <br /> <br />'I'm No Angel' begins like 'Thank You', but their similarities soon end when the vocals kick in. This is a beautiful track, but definitely not a standout. Dido's vocals are very interesting, almost as if everything she's saying is a statement and she's not willing to discuss it further. She hits some exquisite higher notes a few times on this song, which help it out quite significantly. 'My Life' is a very slow track. It begins so softly that it actually makes me want to close my eyes and fall asleep. This song enforces strength and independence. The piano on this track is simple, but magnificent. I find that it and the vocals really hold the song together and also intertwine with one another beautifully to result in a laid-back, subdued work of art. I love the lines \\"And I'm tired, and bored/Of waiting for you/And all those things/You never do\\". 'Take My Hand' is a bonus track, and it completes the album perfectly. It begins with unadorned vocals, sounding eerie and distant, as though they're echoes from somewhere far away. The music then starts to speed up, and builds beautifully before Dido begins to sing again. This is a sweet and charming love song, filled with sincerity and openness. The string arrangements come in about halfway through the song and build up beautifully and add stunning depth and splendor. <br /> <br />Music fans who have heard and liked singles of Dido's on the radio should buy this album. Also, fans of musicians such as Sarah McLachlan and Sinead O'Connor will also appreciate Dido's talent. Her music is put together beautifully, including many different elements which come together perfectly. Her lyrics are honest and suit her vocal ability, and accompanying music flawlessly. 'No Angel' is truly a haunting, memorable, and beautiful debut album, highly recommended. <br /> <br />THE FINAL VERDICT: 98%
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Good battle scenes, though few; beautiful sets; exquisite scenery, however...  First of all, why does Menelaus die?  Why does Paris stay alive?  Why doesn't Cassandra ever make an appearance?  Why does Briseis kill Agammemnon?  Why the heck are ALL THE FACTS from Homer's epic changed?  I don't understand why Orlando Bloom (Paris) is featured as a starring actor in epic films, when his acting sucks.  Brad Pitt (Achilles) isn't too bad, however I'm sure that most women were mostly concerned with his \\"physique\\" rather than his acting.  And the only actor I was actually looking forward to seeing, Sean Bean (Odysseus), was always in the background.  Eric Bana (Hector) was great, and Peter O'Tootle (Priam), as expected, gave a performance worthy of a king.  The movie was beautifully made, but was ruined by its inconsistency.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I was willing to believe, for a moment, that Madonna was a far more meaningful, goal-driven, relevant, and even ARTISTIC artist in her \\"old age\\" than anyone had given her credit for - and I firmly believe that 2000's MUSIC nearly proves this, it remains her greatest post-Like a Prayer accomplishment, if not her best record.  So, American Life wanted to be a protest album, or a highly personal album, or a political respite of kinds, or... the first recording ever to use the word \\"profusion\\"?  I'm afraid it fails at nearly all of its goals.  While I think there's more to the galvanic single of \\"American Life\\" (that oddity that rhymes \\"Mini-Cooper\\" with \\"Super duper\\") than most gave it credit for, the rest of the album offers little that's not a chore to listen to.  Her political lyrics don't seem to interact at all with Mirwais's over-the-top dance productions on songs like \\"Love Profusion,\\" and, for the most part, her protest seems to take the form of... rejecting materialism and embracing soccer-mom-dom.  That tends to make her concept a tough swallow, and the songs of personal revelation clunkers that require trudging through - I can think of few less-effective lyrics than \\"I always wished that I could find/ someone as beautiful as you/ but in the process I forgot/ that I was special too.\\"

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I've fallen in love with Mr. Buble for all the obvious reasons a girl could    he's cute   he's sexy   he's talented   he's rich   he's available  he' young  he's just perfect! <br /> <br />Actually now that I've got my sillyness out, he's a handsome young man who has a magnificent voice singing songs the way I love them sung. From the first perfect note on the song called Feeling Good and on thru this is an outstanding mix of contemporary music initially made famous by the likes of Steve Wonder, James Taylor, Englebert Humbperdinck and Sinatra himself. Buble has made them reborn classics and it's time!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|This CD is Slipknot's highly anticipated 2004 release. It is good, but compared to the band's older work it sucks. The CD is good. Its just that nothing on it surpasses any of their older works. The accoustic guitar songs on the CD are suprisingly great (especially \\"Circle\\"), and its heavier tracks, like \\"Vermilion\\", are great. But, really there is just nothing special here. \\"Opium of The People\\" and \\"Three Nil\\" are great songs. Other good songs include the album's lead single (\\"Duality\\"), \\"The Blister Exists\\", \\"Vermilion, Pt. 2\\", \\"Nameless\\", and \\"Before I Forget\\". Well, if you are a hardcore maggot than this is definetely a must have. If you aren't a really big fan of the band, than you'd be better of picking up Iowa instead.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I finally tuned in to what my friends had said about this cd and I'm glad I did. This is good and good value. Norah, sorry it took me so long.
B000002UAX|5.0|Hey kid, you have no clue what the beatles are about, revolver, although no where near as popular as the white album, was possibly the beatles greatest, and arguably their only \\"rock and roll\\" album.  The white album songs which you have neglected to put on your list of 13 are equally good, and in some cases better than your list.  Go take some history lessons and look at what was going on with the beatles when they made their albums, and don't judge the ones you don't like because you are looking at them through eyes that have no clue what the beatles are about.
0060005688|5.0|Truly outstanding.  Rigorous analysis, impeccable organization and logic, clear writing.  Rich but not complex in its interweaving of economics, psychology, sociology, anthropology and applied wisdom.  Rewarding to read in full, unlike so many books with a single excellent idea that a one-page synopsis could express.  One of my favorite books of the last several years, suitable for anyone with intellectual curiosity or a personal need to make decisions more easily or with greater satisfaction.
0385510454|5.0|John is defintely back and I'm so pleased! For a while there it seemed like he lost interest or was distracted and the story lines seemed to wander and never reach the peak of the earlier books. But The Broker has restored my faith. Let's hope for another run by the master.
068987474X|5.0|Great Book!  I wish this book had been around years ago when I first started dating!  It's got some great advice.  Some of it I knew but a lot of it I didn't know and some of it I needed clarification on.  I like the author's friendly and understanding way of writing.  It's an easy and fun read, and many parts were funny.  If you're a parent with a teenage daughter it would be a great book for them too.
0804106304|4.0|Personally, I thought the book was going to be better than expected, seeing that it was a reading requirement for English. Amy Tan has a knack for writing, espically in this style. I enjoyed the fact that the reader had the ability to go into the minds of each of the characters and knowing the whole situtation. Also, the story-line was great because it was something that people could have emotion towards. I also liked the fact that it wasn't a fairy-tale type story, where everything was happy, and nothing ever goes wrong.  However, I believe many people over-critize this novel. This story is something that is not  limited to Asains and thier struggles. In fact, this is a story that EVERY PERSON can relate to, not just Asians or minorities in general.  This story is about mothers and thier relationship with their daughters as well as being a part of a certain culture. The main idea is mothers passing down their life experiences to their kin and hopefully, them using the advice to their advantage. Everyone has gone through a period of time when they believed that their parents didn't understand them and visa-versa.
0743454537|5.0|The ending of which I do not want to give away to future readers, albeit painful, triggered much thought in me.  Here's a family, living each day wondering if it will be the last for one of them. Because of this, they cherish \\"moments\\" with this family member rather than days or hours, respecting her time on earth like fragile glass, even to the neglect of other members. They become used to the dreadful expiration and wear it like a second skin, giving her doses of time, love, and attention in the process.  Picoult's ending left me feeling devastated and blind-sided when a different member of the family dies than the one with the terminal illness.   It was unexpected. The reader had not spent time lamenting with the family over her possible passing. The family had not cherished each moment of her life as if it might be her last.  They were not prepared for this tragedy ...And such is life.  Shouldn't we cherish each of the ones we love as if it may be the last moment?  <br />     All this to say, the ending sent a chilling and poignant message that altered my thought processes a bit. The sign of a great writer! The only other book that has come close to \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" in emotional intensity is \\"Cries of the Orchids,\\" by Terri Bailey.  RabidReader will want to stay away from that one, too!
B0007O38F8|2.0|this cd wasn`t good  it only had a couple of good songs but bad production,dre only produced 3 songs.the only good songs are in my hood, and i`m supposed to dye tonight.He also tryied too hard to diss nas i dont care about ja ,  jada or fat joe but he is not on nas` level what was he thinking. NOT SMART  <br /> <br /> DON`T BUY THIS CD BUY THE DOCUMENTARY BETTER OR STRAIGHT OUTTA CA$HVILLE
1591391105|1.0|Did Mr. Watkins write this book because he had something to say or he just had to say something? <br /> <br />Lots of words compressed in very little thought that offers any value...  I wonder who these folks are giving this book a rating of higher than a star.  If Amazon allowed negative ranking I would have done that as I feel I wasted my money and time reading pure garbage.. Harvard Press needs to be a little more picky in terms of what it publishes associations with books like these will diminish the message of any good ones they come out. <br />The following is culled out from the book;  <br />\\"The root causes of transition failure always lie in the pernicious interaction between the situation, with its opportunities and pitfalls, and the individual, with his or her strength and vulnerabilities\\"  <br /> <br />Please draw your own conclusions. <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|50 Cent got a second wind a couple years back with \\"In Da Club\\" which was Catchy&worked. but He trys so hard here to re-capture the magic&falls flat.He got sucked into the Eminem/Dr.Dre Lab Formula&it takes it's toll on his creativity here. He isn't able to drop that one cut that you go now this is gonna be the cornerstone of the Album.instead of finding a 50 cent piece this Cat goes digging into the Penny Jar&finds nothing but Lemons that are dated&tired.this Cat is selling off Wolf Tickets,Hype&Association more than on his own Skills. 50 understands how to work a Hook&do something catchy,but He ain't making nothing that moves me.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|this is a great dvd and expresses the exact feelings that pink floyd was trying to express through this album. alot of people dont understand this movie and thats why they give it so few stars but they just dont understand what pink floyd is about. Buy it today
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Jamie Foxx&Tom Crusie have real good chemistry in this film that feels sometimes like a virtual Reality film in spots.Michael Mann does a Good job here with the pacing after a while. Jada Pinkett Smith ain't bad. 04 was Brother Foxx's Year. He was on Point in all his works last year.Tom Crusie was cool in this film though certain things didn't make sense,but overall the film was cool.
B000000YG5|5.0|Don't mind other reviews that place Rollins at at position behind Coltrane and Miles in skill and relative importance. Rollins, who is far too different stylistically from Coltrane and Miles to compare, has been utterly successful at producing the most melodic and thematic jazz of its history. \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" is a MASTERPIECE, and without a doubt is as perfect a jazz album as \\"Kind of Blue\\" or \\"Blue Train.\\" Each song contributes proportionally to produce a versatile, impressing, and beautiful album. For those who would like to get into jazz, they should first delve into this Rollins album even before \\"Kind of Blue\\", because patience is required for jazz, but less so for Rollins and than for Miles. I also recommend the film about Rollins that goes by the same title.
6300271447|5.0|My rating is for the original version.  I'd give the \\"director's cut\\" 3 stars.  I invite all newcomers to the Woodstock experience to compare the original cut (if you can find it--it's not yet on DVD) to the \\"director's cut.\\"  I only ask that you see the original cut first (if possible, more than once).  The two together may form a more complete picture of the whole festival, but in my opinion, the original cut is far artistically superior, in regard to its editing, to the \\"director's cut.\\"  One point of reference: note in the original cut how the crowd chanting \\"no rain\\" and beating on various objects segues so artfully into Santana's \\"Soul Sacrifice.\\" (one of the high points of the film for me.)  That and many other precious moments are lost in the director's cut.  True, the original could have dumped Sha Na Na in favor of more Joplin and Jefferson Airplane, but overall, the cadence and pacing of the original are, in my opinion, far superior to the cut available on DVD.  I only hope the original cut becomes available on DVD.  In the meantime, I'm going to spring for the VHS version.  For those who deplore the sound quality of the original, think of it as a piece of precious history that will never happen again.  Consider the time and the available technology and just enjoy the experience.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is by far the best album I have ever listened to in my entire life. His songs are so pleasing to listen to, with lyrics that will open your eyes. His songs speak of love, and his lyrics are full of such brutal honesty it brings tears to my eyes to listen. He has the ability to make his audience feel exactly what he is feeling, which is an extremely rare and extraordinary gift. I really cannot stress just how poignant, thoughtful and touching his lyrics are. Almost anyone can relate in some way to his lyrics. For me, his lyrics opened up my eyes to things I hadn't seen before, especially concerning my feelings about people. Best songs on the CD: The Blower's Daughter, Volcano, Cannonball, Cheers Darlin', The Professor, I Remember...Not in that order, of course. But really, every song is wonderful and pleasing to the ears (as well as the mind). Buy the CD, you won't regret it.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|The only reason I even heard of the Arcade Fire was because I'm as big of a Bowie fan as they get, and the way he was talking them up made me think this was serious. <br /> <br />\\"Funeral\\" is not total sludge, but it is a bit of bore in many areas. It is not brilliant. It is not the best album of 2004. The band is not the best thing to come along in the new milennium. I think rock has been degraded to such a low point that any attempt at introspective rehashing of the 70's and 80's is considered a masterpiece. If this was a different time period the band as a whole would not have received nearly as much hype. I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Funeral\\" is forgotten about as quickly as it was hyped in the indie world. Some of the Pixies comparisions on here annoyed me. <br /> <br />The album DOES have hints of potential. And they do manage to put on a mean live performance. They have an EP that's only available at their shows (but some people are wrongfully spending $150 on Ebay for it) that is pleasant. A modest debut, but I await their next effort.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|While listening to this album all the way through it creates a sense that the listener is hearing the music while traveling through space. Well, thats just me. With a vivid imagination and an incredibly open mind (due to the 77 minute length) the listening experience can be quite rewarding. It reminds me of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd's best elements infused with latin passion with a near overdose of ambition. I strongly reccommend this spectacular album to any serious music fan.
B0007P3582|2.0|50 Cent produced an instant hip-hop classic with the relentless \\"In Da Club,\\" but he's sadly fallen victim to the sophomore slump here. This album was overall a disappointment-nothing here can even hold a candle to his debut smash, but there's a minimal dose of airy club fun anyway. The album's anthemic closer, the G-Unit remix of \\"Hate It Or Love It,\\" is one of its few perks. It's hooky and has upbeat lyrics. The overrated \\"Disco Inferno\\" and repetitive \\"In My Hood\\" do little to deviate the listener's attention away from the album's overall mediocrity. Dr. Dre produces some cuts here, but if his classic `2001' album taught me anything, it's that he saves the hottest beats for himself (not to say that that's a bad thing-I'd probably do the same). The crunky bounce of \\"Piggy Bank\\" is alright, one of the better tracks here. The thumping march of \\"Outta Control\\" verges on anthemic-a predictable single, but yet again nothing spectacular. The disc's highlight, however, is the titillating \\"Candy Shop.\\" This doesn't mean it's a stellar track on its own-just the best one here (which isn't saying much, because this album is wholly not too impressive). The lyrics rise barely above juvenile (despite their suggestive tones), but it is catchy, nonetheless. The thumping, club-friendly backing track and production are what really make the song work. When I first heard it, I assumed its guest, Olivia, was just your typical rap video wannabe backup hoochie-I was not impressed by her vocals. I was pleasantly surprised when I gave her solo offerings a try, however (I'm shocked infectious anthems like \\"Bizounce\\" and club jams like \\"You Got The Damn Thing\\" didn't make this girl a diva). \\"Candy Shop,\\" sadly, is not a good representation of Olivia's skills-she actually *can* sing, and her velvety voice can make even the most foul-mouthed raps sound smooth. Regardless, this song is some 50-accented sugar, created mainly for its beat to be enjoyed and to get the ladies' asses moving. 50 definitely has talent as a rapper, but he has apparently regressed since his debut, which was a potential rap classic. Either way, he has some work to do before he can be compared to true hip hop greats such as 2Pac or Dr. Dre.
B0002YLC24|5.0|It seems to usually be a mandate in Hollywood (and its' various filmmaking extranneous entities) that all sequels to any movie, good or bad, must stink, and do a grievous injustice to a prequel that was perfect left alone. Examples from this year extend to Bridget Jones' Diary: The Edge of Reason, Shrek 2, and other such excuses for entertainment, but this mandate has managed to surpass a precious few: Toy Story 2 and Before Sunset. <br />The thought of a sequel to such a benignly lovely story may have instilled fear in the hearts of cult fans of Before Sunrise, but the sequel was not only a breath of fresh air for those of us holding our figurative breaths, but an equally well done masterpiece as its' forefather that explored in depth all of the potential mistakes the movie could have made before casting them away in favor of a lovely, realistic conclusion(?) to the romance of Delpy and Hawke. For instance, Delpy and Hawke, who have parted and led haphazard lives since their parting nine years ago, acknowledge their respective social positions and divergent lives before admitting to their love to eachother that has burned brighter the years they've been apart. I won't give away the ending (oops- I guess I already did. You could have guessed it anyways by one glance at the cover) but nothing is hokey or surreal about Before Sunset, and it is just as beautiful and well done a film as Before Sunrise.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|''THE MATRIX'' saga will never be forgotten.The amazing storyline,the inner messages,the great action sequences,the ground-breaking special effects...But I believe that the best of all is the ending.By their opinions about the DVD's commentaries,and the opportunity that ''THE MATRIX ONLINE'' video-game gives you to change the story of the Matrix,I think that the Wachowski bros. want the viewers to have and keep their own opinion about the strange ending.By that,I think they give the audience the opportunity to end the trilogy as they like.Since in this review I write my opinion about this product,I will also write my opinion about the ending.Attention,SPOILER!!! <br />Smith is destroyed right after he clones Neo because his purpose is fullfiled,which is to kill Neo.A program can't exist without a purpose.This is something that we hear in two conversations from ''THE MATRIX RELOADED'':Neo-Oracle,and Neo-Smith(for the first time).But then if Smith and the Oracle knew that,why did Smith cloned Neo?And why didn't the Oracle told Neo before the final battle?Well,I believe that they already knew that,but they didn't actually understood it-neither did we when we first heard it,right?
B00002E224|5.0|Before Sunrise (and it's sequel, Before Sunset) is the kind of movie you can watch again and again and again and never get tired of its' beautiful script, Hawke's and Delpy's whimsical chemistry, and the beautiful backdrop of Vienna. It's only flaw is the tears that burn down the faces of the world's singletons in gleeful wistfulness at the sight of two soulmates exchanging their love. But those seeking substance, do not flee for fear of wishy-washiness; the script is smart, edgy, and exciting, and more like looking in on the dialogue of two friends for an evening rather than a potentially entertaining, multimillion dollar production. Sweet, beautiful, and enchanting, Before Sunrise has twice the substance of the average romantic comedy, a beautiful and well chosen cast  (of two) and a lovely, almost tangibly realistic, storyline. If I could only take ten movies with me on a desert island to spend the rest of eternity with, Before Sunrise (and its' equally lovely sequel) would be two of the first I'd reach for.
B00023B1LC|2.0|This movie feautures a very smart plot,supported by a talented director,but is ruined by the really bad characters.You can't understand how they think,and worst of all,you can't like them.Especially Bourne.I mean,what's up with the guy?He's the ''good guy'',but he's always angry,shaking innoccent people just because things are not like he wants them to me.I've seen ''anti-heroes'' in films before,but not in action films,and not like that!He even bumps his girlfriend's back on the door at some point! <br />Sorry Liman,but my opinion is that if the characters are bad,so is the film.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Since Madonna is So Into Making out w/Women shouldn't she have called her latest project, \\"American Man.\\" <br /> <br />Lets get real, she's at a desperate time in her life. <br /> <br />Maybe she should have that operation she so obviously longs for.  <br /> <br />It might help her failing career.  <br /> <br />At least that would be a 'real' reinvention. <br />
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This sure is the best horror film I have ever watched.It's not scary-it has a twisted plot,and a chilly view from the director's eye.It doesn't feauture much violence either,but this is covered by far by the psychological pressure that the characters get from Jigsaw,and how he changes their lifes.Jigsaw is not like most cinematic killers.He's a mad person who tries to actually help people through his insanity.Through the film you'll be amazed by how good the script is written,linking so many facts from the movie into one,gasping conclusion. <br />When the end titles appeared,I just stayed right there,still watching,amazed by the ending.Trust me,I guess the killer most of the times in the movies,but in this one,it didn't even crossed my mind.So grand is the revealance of the killer,that it will propably give you a reason to watch it for a second time,since by knowing the killer already,you will watch the movie in a whole new experience.
B00005JMYI|3.0|70s throwback movies seem to go through a minor vogue period last year - as well as 'Anchorman', 'Starsky and Hutch' made it big last summer. Will Farrell stars as Ron Burgundy - scotch loving, smooth haired, charming, big fish in a small pond newscaster in 1970s San Diego, loved by all with his catchprase 'Stay Classy San Diego'. He bestrides a ludicrous team of reporters such as the retarded weatherman Brick and sexist primal jackass reporter Brian. This absurd assembly is shattered by the arrival of the stereotypically glamorous Veronica Corningstone. Ron preposterously seduces her, despite her obvious intial misgivings and this upsets the boys culture around the newsroom. Things go badly wrong for Will after he accidently hits a moustacioed biker with a burrito, leading ultimately to Veronica taking over as chief anchor.<br /><br />The movie is, primarily, a comedy, and it is funny. So it succeeds. But it could have been so much better. Instead of being a tight, acerbic satire of early feminist breakthroughs in sexist, boys dominated 1970s institutions. Instead, it is dominated by Farrell (who tailored the script himself) to such an extent that it becomes a showcase for him to experiment with all his goofy comic talent. Thus the comedy falls from the rank of those that are both funny and meaningful and holds itself shabbily together as a reduculous goofball romp. Shame.
B000002G9S|4.0|This radio classic rocks! All Right Now is one of my favorite <br />songs of all time. I want to own this album.
6304708491|5.0|... and I've seen it DOZENS and DOZENS of times since.  It never fails to make me laugh even though I can recall virtually every line in it by heart... I STILL LAUGH.  I haven't read every review here, so I'm not sure if anyone has alluded to this film's tie-in with Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"Gunga-Din\\" directly.  But, there is a clear parellel to the religious cult pursuing Ringo and the religious cult in the story Gunga-Din, not to mention the film's tie-in with Ludwig Von Beethoven.   English actor Leo McKern revives that cult in a very comical way as does the rest of his cult cohorts.  Then too, there is Eleanor Bron; Victor Spinelli (who played the role of the television producer in \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" (and less notably appeared in \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"); Roy Kinnear (no relation to Greg that I know of); Patrick Cargill; Alfie Bass; and, others who can be seen in several other English movies and English television of the era, also mainly in comical roles.  The casting of this movie, aside from The Beatles themselves, was brilliant.  The only thing missing perhaps was Peter Sellers in the flesh, but you can sense Peter Sellers' spirit impacting upon this film.  I make mention of these items because I feel they only add to the tapestry that makes \\"HELP!\\" a really delightful, fun film to watch over and over again, standing the comedic test of time as much as the Marx Brothers, or, Crosby & Hope, Abbott & Costello, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields, Danny Kaye and other great comedic talents too numerous to mention. <br />P.S. To whom it may concern:  Dear Whom, Please re-release this DVD soon, my VHS copy is getting worn out.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is Dire Straits' first best CD of all time. I get Brothers <br />in Arms, and Sultans of Swing in addition to this album. Heavy <br />Fuel, Calling Elvis, The Bug, On Every Street, & When it Comes <br />to You are my favorite tracks on this CD. Heavy Fuel and the Bug <br />are hard rock/metal songs that I could play over n over again. <br />Heavy Fuel is what I call my all time favorite song. Ever. If <br />you are new to Dire Straits, you probably need the Sultans first. <br />Enjoy it and any rock fan needs this CD. <br />Way better than Communique, & or Making Movies. <br /> <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|man i love this cd the song are awsome!!! <br />going under:really cool i saw the music video it was kinda creepy <br />bring me to life: this song is really great! <br />well all the song's are great altough i don't know why the people call evanescence goth when there not?
B000000OSE|5.0|This is the best song ever made in my life. This song rocks so <br />hard. I like to bang my head hard onto this song because it is <br />such an awesome headbanger. Also the riff by Slash in November Rain is so awesome. This song is way better than Free Bird. That's why I won this Cd because November Rain had such awesome <br />riffs and probably the best riffs I've ever heard. Live and Let <br />Die is also really great. This is a great addition if you like <br />Appetite for Destruction.
