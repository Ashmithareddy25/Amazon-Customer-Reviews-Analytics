1423113381|5.0|Great price for the hard cover addition at half the cost of the coffee shop with a book store attached to it that we all know so well.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I absolutely loved the first two MIB movies--that is why I purchased them on DVD.  You won't go wrong with MIB and MIB II.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book introduces several new and mainly supporting characters.  It also expands the story through several others' eyes and less with some of the more popular characters.  The book feels like it is building the story for the next book.  A worthwhile read still.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|its ok but u cant so fractions I left my calculator at school and that CAN do fraction id ratter use my cheap calculator from school
B009FZHYKU|2.0|I canceled my television subscription about half a year ago and use only online platforms to watch tv and movies, as I don't own any DVDs or VHS either. I watch pretty much whatever I want, whenever I want to, for about 90% less than I used to pay. Many current episodes are available online at the stations website (e.g. CBS, NBC, CW) and the only channel i really REALLY miss is BBCA. Even AMC which puts out Walking Dead, has a few episodes online and so can be a free source of entertainment. Plus venues like Netflix or Amazon Prime have TONS of programming that you just could never get via a cable tv subscription. What if I were a recent convert to the cult of dead? Where could I see the ENTIRE series from beginning?<br />Anyhow, I prefer venues like Amazon and Netflix for tv series, because of the price difference (when I had cable, I was paying $125 per month. My mom still pays $200 per month - that's insane!) and because while viewing each episode, it is commercial free, uninterrupted viewing. I wanted to type those four words in all caps, I feel so strongly about how wonderful it is. Next to shameless and despicable price gouging, I really really hated how crap was encroaching on my screen during viewing via cable. Never mind one small opaque logo in the corner. Commercials pushing in from all corners, running across the entire bottom of the screen, blocking translation if someone happened to be saying something not in english, covering up what could potentially be a crucial part of the scene - a visual clue or a bit of action important to plot. Plus it's just plain UGLY, on both moral and artistic levels.<br />This disgusting practice may very well ooze into netflix and amazon and onto other programming formats. But until it does, I am extremely grateful for what I have now: an entire season, each episode put out less than 24 hours after initially airing on cable, that is 100% commercial free uninterrupted viewing - which I can go back and watch again whenever I want, long after it's become unavailable on cable.<br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is, I am used to the netflix feature of a tv series, wherein you can start the next episode from within the current. On amazon, you have to click out of full screen, go down to the list of episodes, click the next to queue it up top, click to start, then click full screen again. Annoying in comparison.<br /><br />**Update April 1, 2013**<br /><br />I must drastically reduce my star rating, for both artistic and technical reasons.<br /><br />Artistically, this season exemplifies typical corporate approach to milking a hit show for every penny possible whilst draining quality from it like blood from a deer hung in the garage. I was unaware of the 2011 firing of Frank Darabont until late 2012, by which time I had grown so dissatisfied with the declining show quality that I was moved to research why it was happening -- to a show that for all appearances should have been able to stay high quality for a lot longer. Check the article on screenrant from August 2011 for more info:[...]<br /><br />For technical reasons amazon cannot provide me the last episode of the season; I suspect this is happening to many MANY users. Mine was a season pass one-click purchase that failed. No explanation, no blurb on the page that says technical difficulties, just non-working purchase buttons and a not so subtle hint that it just might be my own fault (\\"if the episode doesn't show up in a few hours, check your payment methods\\"). After researching the issue and trying unsuccessfully to contact amazon customer support, I finally got a pop up that said they're experiencing problems for the episode and apologize for \\"this\\" inconvenience at \\"this\\" time.<br /><br />I agree with other comments that alternative sources would be better at this point. But is itunes really any better? I doubt it, and it's more expensive. Plus I have a \\"library\\" here at amazon that I can never move or use elsewhere. Were Ito come to the point of complete disgust and cancel my amazon account, I would forever lose access to movies and tv shows that I have FULLY purchased. Gone. Even if I came back and re-opened my amazon account, the digital property that I purchased would NOT be returned to me. Maybe itunes is the way to go, for as far as I know, you can still burn itunes purchased content onto other formats and ACTUALLY fully own what you have paid for...my amazon account, I would forever lose access to movies and tv shows that I have FULLY purchased.

B0018O4YT0|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it first came out.  Saw it again on TV, I think, or maybe I have just been looking for it to be on TV--either way, I really wanted to see it again and again.
B009GEAWOU|4.0|..even though Season 8 is still going.<br /><br />Lots of &#34;grown up&#34; matters this season as well as realizations that life happens and we all need to move on with our life's in order to seek optimal happiness.
B008Q08PIK|5.0|This was a great movie... It will never go out of style.  It's better than many movies today. You should see it.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game to pass time.  always loved playing this game at arcades.  just wish didnt drop coins down side so much
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Trombone is amasing and this album shows it.  The sound is one of a kind that only he can deliver.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show!!  This show has a little bit of everthing, history, adventure, suspense, and of coarse love stories...show is very well done
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I saw this movie on TV a very long time ago and been wanting to see it again.  Still great!
B005HJU7HA|4.0|My image of Sherlock Holmes comes from the old movies, like Hound of the Baskervilles.  I had no idea that most of the tales were short stories, which is the only reason I didn't give it four stars.  Maybe that's not fair, but for those of you like me who were not aware of this, they are not all full book length mysteries, which was a little disappointing.  As far as the stories themselves, they don't seem to be presented in the order they were written.  I will not spoil anyones reading by saying why, but there are some events that seem to support this theory.  All in all enjoyable reading.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I don't have a perspective on Lincoln from other history books, but I can honestly say this book reads so well - it held my interest as well as any novel.  The author has a writing style that moves you through the amazing story line of Abe Lincoln's life with touches of humor and intricate detail.
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was a good sequel. Anything new though.  I assume the third will be better with the revolution going on.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|I have seen the movie and I loved it.  This is a thoughtful and intriquing movie.  Pop some corn and sit back and watch.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Anyone that likes to be held in suspense for long periods of time will love this book. Definitely fast paced.
B008XKT9FG|3.0|This is a good movie but not spectacular.  It does draw you in but is some what long and the acting is good.  Has a moral to the story too and an unexpected twist at the end.  All in all not a waste of time.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Pleasantly surprised at the emotional level of this story.  It is refreshing to see that these subjects are addressed. I really appreciated the &#34;tenderness&#34; and humor.  It had a big impact on me.  All three actors were perfect for their parts. I laughed, I cried and I learned.  Thank you for this film.
1401207529|5.0|Not quite as good as the recent movies, but decent. Sadly it gets a wee bit corny at times. Also not quite appropriate for younger children with the hookers and baby kidnapping.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Steven Spielberg did a great job on this movie also, have to give them thumbs up. If you like  automated movie's directed by Steven Spielberg you will like this movie.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|This movie really sucked.  There's barely a plot and it's poor at best.  It keeps paying homage to Alien, and really who cares?  How about creating a decent movie in it's own right?  Save your money.
B000IDEQTK|4.0|Exciting in some moments, a little slow in others, specially at the beginning. Amazing atmosphere in Italy! A little corny in my opinion
B003JTHESA|4.0|I'm giving it 4 stars because I liked the first song. The rest I found pretty boring and sounded like songs that would have been filler on earlier albums.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel Washington does it again he is a great actor super super movie, this really happens in real life and shows use reality
B002DW92SE|5.0|This book was genuinely fun to read like other Hornby stuff & also had some fine serious themes to set you thinking.  All I want a book to be.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Nice, light, easy to watch. I was looking for some fresh movie with not too much of over thinking and this one was perfect. I got relax of the mess of my weekend on a nice Sunday afternoon with it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone always recommended seeing this film.  I gave up eating meat over a year ago for ethical reasons, and this film just further proved I made a good decision.  It had a lot of facts and didn't feel like propaganda to me.  Definitely worth seeing.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A great book recommended to me by an old teacher, completely unexpected and fantastic writing that i would read over again any day.
1449410243|5.0|Even if you aren't familiar with The Oatmeal's work, this is a great coffee table book. Lots of laughs and enjoyable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love historical fiction, so that I love Downton Abbey isn't very surprising. I know that much of the servants' lives are made prettier for television, but I like that the family also has its share of trouble. Money doesn't fix everything, and money can disappear. Money doesn't keep you or your loved ones from getting sick, dying, etc.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I was 11 years old when \\"Rocky\\" was made, but I didn't actually see it or any of the sequels till I was 19. Back then you could only get the movies on VHS or Beta tapes... Ok, I know I am dating myself!!<br />  My third son is our resident 'tech-guy' and hates watching \\"grainy, fuzzy television.\\" He would almost rather not watch at all than watch an old video tape, so I ordered this set to try to update my movie collection.<br />  The evening after these movies arrived, my sons started watching the series all over again. It brought back fond memories... They loved these films as they were growing up!<br />  The price of the set was too good pass up and the picture quality is good enough to get my son's stamp of approval... That says it all!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was EXCELLENT. I had a hard time starting it, but once I got started there was no stopping me. That year's twist on the hunger games was so unexpected...but you'll have to read it to find out!
0307155102|5.0|Great book. For age 3 and above. Kid love it alot. Beauitful drawings.<br />Worth every cent it cost. get it.
B00009UTQD|5.0|It came fast and well packaged.I put in the filters that I use the most in my camera. I like Tamrac.

B001GCVFHI|3.0|The book was hard to read and keep track of who was saying what to whom.  I liked Kitchen God's Wife much more.
0375812024|5.0|Great book. For age 3 and above. Kid love it alot. Beauitful drawings.<br />Worth every cent it cost. get it.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|Second time purchasing this.  When it fills up, the Brother Multi-Function Printer error code 42 is displayed.  You can actually take it apart and shake out the excess toner, but it's messy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun for all ages! I at times can not stop playing it. It is a must have for Ice Age fans.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|It is wonderful that Disney created a movie with the little ones in mind and made sure it is gentle and non -scary.<br />My daughters are fascinated with new princess. I already spent a little fortune for Sofia's costumes, tiaras and amulets. I feel lucky I did as their sizes are already gone from the market.<br /><br />Sofia's stories are amazingly gentle and they are so easy to absorb for the little ones. I am curious how they will put them on the DVD, I expect it will be the collection. If you are not srue aobut the story go to the bookstore or buy on amazon inexpensive golden books on Sofia and read with yoru child or by yourself and check what you think of the story.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|What can I say about a perfect movie. Singing, Songs, Humor, Drama, Sets, Costumes and ACTING all 5 STAR.<br />And now on Blu-ray, it is complete. Beautiful picture as never seen before.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy to read & parts were hard to put down. Cute plot nothing complicating. Some parts did not flow well but hey it was free.
B003D513TQ|5.0|One of the best portrayals of coming of age/power I have seen. A beautiful love story. I hope the life lived equaled the portrayal. I loved it!
B004UNX1LS|1.0|the video quality is low.  I tried more than a few videos and they all where blurry on kindle fie hd<br />.
B004LOJPLQ|5.0|Amazing movie with amazing actors. Very inspiring story and the fact that it's true is awesome. Will watch again soon
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book! Saw movie first then liked book just as well.  Plan to buy blu-ray. Can't wait to see it again.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|reminds me a bit of Radiohead, but they definitely stand out in their own right. Looking forward to hearing their live stuff.
B000TGJ7ZY|2.0|Good movie but I didn't want to hear Mr. Coppola talk through out the movie.  I had to buy a different version.
B007H7XRLI|5.0|Big fan of these types of movies. If you liked 300 you will like this movie in my opinion. Awsome
B009G78EE2|5.0|I really like this rap artist. Some of his music is very moving, while other songs will make you want to dance.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a very engaging book.  There is a sadness about it.  It really demonstrates the lack of freedom that women used to have.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Couldn't put this book down! i felt a great mix of emotions reading this series ; dread, sorrow, depression, and just the right inkling of hope that pushes you to the end in a furious reading frenzy . i only gave it 4 stars because the writing just seemed slightly off sometimes kind of amateurish, but i feel pretty bad about that. I really want to give it like 4 and a half stars.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game! when I go to the hospital to visit my mom I play temple run game.  when she is sleeping I play temple run to pass the time, until she wakes up.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|This app is good for those who want to search for files on your Kindle.  It looks like it is a good program but I haven't really a lot of time to check it out.  So please do go by this review, it free, try it for yourself.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Game is cute and easy to play. Graphics good. My daughter absolutely loves it. Leveling up its easy for her so its more exciting. Great game for kids.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|After reinvigorating the James Bond franchise for a fifth time with Casino Royale and then inexplicably fouling itself with Quantum Of Solace (including what I think is the first bad theme song for a James Bond movie), the series is back on solid ground with the latest installment. Not only is there an excellent script in place, but also very good actors, well-choreographed action sequences, strong character development and a theme song reminiscent of The Spy Who Loved Me & Licence To Kill (the latter being my personal favourite James Bond film).<br /><br />Biblically speaking, the action sequences are considerably amped up from the level of all the previous James Bond films (excluding the last two), but the violence isn't graphic. Language is minimal in this installment (it's usually never been that much of a concern with this series), and sensuality is limited to two brief scenes. However, there may be another scene that qualifies as almost erotic, and which I will discuss in my next sentence. The main reason I didn't see this film in theaters is because there's a scene where the villain caresses Bond's chest & legs (and possibly his groin off-screen, where the camera focuses on Bond's face); that may be interpreted as a homoerotic overtone, but I personally thought of it as a form of psychological torture ala The Joker in The Dark Knight. Look at that scene any way you want.<br /><br />There are some very nice surprises in store for fans of the franchise...<br /><br />007 reporting for duty.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is kinda easy, but Temple Run 2 is more challenging! But, I must say, if you think Temple Run is hard, DO NOT GET THIS APP. I really like the touches Imangi Studios gave to it. For example: the zipline, the mine, etc. I also like the Gems. If you're looking for a challenging app, this is the one for you!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is an app everyone should have in there Kindle.  I use it all the time.  I really like the feature where it wall actually pronounce the word.  I am sure there is a lot more features on this app I haven't found yet.  Excellent app for all ages.
B005HSL626|5.0|cool game I love it are you going to make another one Usa hzh nh Hhs bb nh nh hj
B003AKLFAG|5.0|I've been a fan of Korean cinema for a long time.<br />This film was a surprise.<br />I'd watch it a again and enjoy it even more.<br />Complex plot and characters.<br />It left me fairly breathless.<br />5 stars.<br />A twisted tale of revenge.<br />Worth your time to view it.
0783114893|1.0|It's a shame this movie has never gotten a decent DVD release, much less a blu-ray like that god-awful remake. The movie is great, but until justice is done and it's given a proper restoration you should stay away from this DVD like the plague.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was filled with mystery and adventure. If you like sad books you'll like this series!!! I know I did!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I played the first 25 levels in a matter of minutes. Very addicting and fun game. Definitely recommending this to my friends.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|honestly read this book because it was a freebee but totally, TOTALLY enjoyed the read!!! It was informative, sad but loving at it's end. Loved the descriptions of the time period and location.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Great read, couldn't put it down. Went back and read her first two books which were also great reads. Can't wait for her next one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My sister's love it. It's just enough to keep them entertained with out spending a lot of money. They are younger and love horses so I downloaded it and they haven't stopped playing since
0810970686|5.0|My  7 yrs old love to read , I loved all the diary of a wimpy kid book, and 9 yrs old who dont like to read love to read the diary of a wimpy books, so it's a go for me.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This is not a romantic comedy, thankfully!  Great writing and great acting, naturally.  Treats the most difficult side of sex in marriage, namely communication, superbly.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|People who are serious fans of great literature and stunning performances<br />will treasure this gem!  This full story (4 hour) version of Hamlet makes the<br />story unfold with greater understanding than the usual abbreviated versions<br />brought to the stage and screen.
B00AJLHU3K|3.0|I have been a fan of Richard Thompson since the late 60s, and have followed him through his career, both via recording and live performances (which are always better than the recordings, IMHO).  As a guitarist, Richard is in the top strata.  His chops are amazing.  As a songwriter, he's written many, many great songs.  It's still too early for me to say whether any of them are on this CD.  He recycles motifs and licks from earlier albums in many of the songs, but perhaps with a few more listens I'll change my mind.  My first impression was that this is a good, not great album.  That being said, a lot of professional reviewers, as well as a coterie of like-minded long-term fans like me, have given it higher marks than I have.  Definitely worth a listen.  I actually like some of the songs on the bonus disc better than the basic album.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great storyline and graphics. Well worth download especially like zoom feature in scenes. Can't wait to finish the game and get another g5 game
0345525558|5.0|The foster care system is tough. I've never worked in it but I am a social worker and author. I believe Vanessa did an awesome job writing this book. I did listen to it on audio while driving to and from work and found myself looking forward to getting into my car to pick up where I'd left off. I love first lines and this was a good one. \\"For eight years I dreamed of fire.\\" Enjoyed the voice of the narrator, she was perfect for reading the characters in this novel. I really enjoyed the way she used flowers throughout the novel and would recommend this book. Hope to read and or listen on audio to more from this talented author.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|Almost impossible to get the tiles to rotate. Decided it wasn't worth it and uninstalled it within a day. A waste of time.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read other books by Mitch Albom and thoroughly enjoyed them. His books always have an important message and have shaped my views about God and life and relationships. My mother recommended this one and I'm glad she did. If you like a good read that challenges to make you better and give you a deeper perspective of life, you'll love this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had not seen this series, but took a chance. I've watched it twice and loaned it out twice more.<br />Everyone agrees its brilliant!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a seriously great read.  I could not put it down!!!  This is exactly why everyone should pay attention in high school physics and chemistry!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I am in love with this singer, cannot wait to see him in concert this summer.  Great album for everyone to enjoy.
1576754227|5.0|I am now working on the most difficult and ugly  tasks in my life first.  This book encourages us to do that and it makes perfect sense.  Get the worse out of the way and the rest is easy!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Excellent series. Too bad it ended with season 8. Amazon was great delivering the stream and in HD audio and video! Amazon Prime customers get a special treat.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I bought this book after all of the hype and decided to give it a try. It's a good book just not my reading style. I've only gotten 30% finished in a month. Good writing just not my reading preference.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|It's a great fisherman and the ocean trolling for the most wonderful dinner with some monsters vs the ultimate test is a great deal of time to put this in the ocean is not fishing light gear and you will have to wait for the most popular articles in the ocean I give it a three
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very touching and fairly reality based, not some unbelievable fairytale. I would recommend to others, plus a box of tissues.
B001B6EAOY|3.0|Purchased this for my PSP, which it doesn't actually fit into well. The PSP will accept it, however, you have to extract it with tweezers. Also, do not do this often as the sides crack easily. The walls of this device are quite thin and delicate.
0525958002|5.0|If you love Duran Duran, and John Taylor, this book is great lots of great behind the scene stuff.  Great Read!!
B00683JK9K|5.0|This is one program that works just like the puzzles we work on our cardtable.<br />Would like to use a few of my own pictures with it.
0316019984|5.0|My husband loved this book. He thought it was a lame gift at first and said our son will like it when he gets older but then when he looked at it he changed that thought. There is a part where the Batman logo lights up in the sky in one of the scenes. He is obsessed with finding out how.
1423151054|5.0|These flips are very cool. There is one book for each of the \\"Nine Old Men\\", Original Disney Animators. Each book is a short illustration from animations they had drawn. If you're a fan of Disney, you'll cherish these books.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Plenty of action and we were not expecting some of the turns.  The story line kept us engaged through the entire movie.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|For once the Amazon appstore beats out Google play.  This is a massive improvement over ANYTHING you can get anywhere else for your tablet.  It is authentic Adobe Photoshop and 9.99 is a steal.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|Not able to give a review as I have never opened it.  Must have ordered it accidently as I was surprised to learn that I had purchased it.  No longer prepare meals as this is done at the senior living community in which I now live.  Ignore the one star  (I hate it) rating.  I simply did not now how to get to this section without indicating a rating.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so addictive! Season 3 was as joyful, suspenseful and tearful (if not more) as the two seasons before it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does the job easily and it is better than the one that comes with the Kindle HD.  A couple of quick taps show you how much time you have until you have to recharge.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|The movie was creepy and disturbing. I think anytime there are families being killed it is disturbing. The people that gave it bad reviews were most likely looking for a big slasher film. But this movie is disturbing because of the kids.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful read.  The story kept evolving throughout with an exciting end.  Look forward to reading more  books authored by Nicholas Sparks.
0143113100|5.0|The book arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  The packaging was excellent and easy to open.  The book contained  the latest research on  brain activity.  I was interesting and timely.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham never ceases to amaze me.  His stories are interesting, easy to follow and keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Bought Watership Down to read with my daughter for her school assignment and loved it all over again (not having read it for 30 years). Highly recommended!

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Excellent price for such a trilogy, I was thrilled to find it packaged together for a gift I was giving.
B008ANFRG6|4.0|But if you only have the money for one CD, you better make sure you buy what you really have a hankering for. If it is your first Vai experience, then I suggest you first take a listen to &#34;Passion and Warfare&#34; so that you get the idea of what your ears will partake of when Vai is inserted into your disc player. Vai is pure virtuosity of the guitar and music theory. Actually the only Vai albums I even have are &#34;Passion and Warfare&#34; and this one, so I am not educated on the music that happened between then and now. I just bought this because I saw him play &#34;Weeping China Doll&#34; live and I needed to hear the song a few more times. While he played it, he just stood completely still and stared into the ceiling. It was like the angels of Rock were bestowing powers into his hands, but I guess he practiced more than most. If you don't have the image of him playing live then your response to the song might be different, but &#34;Weeping China Doll&#34; is still my favorite on the CD, along with &#34;Gravity Storm&#34;. I began to like &#34;Sunshine Electric Raindrops&#34; after hearing it several times. I haven't watched the included DVD yet so I know nothing about it. I give it 4 stars, not 5, because not all the songs plucked my heart strings like &#34;Weaping China Doll&#34; did.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire was even better than the first book. Left me wanting more. A little confusing at the end - had to re-read but am looking forward to the next book. Excellent read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I hope the next Harry Bosch novel ties in with this one so a few questions are answered. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers, cop stories & a flawed hero!
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|I bought this for somebody. I've never seen it, but my friend said he saw it a long time ago and liked it. It had very good reviews online. That's why I bought it. From what I understand the series has and is being remastered or something and re released again in this new great quality. It has been a while since I researched it so I have trouble remembering, but I saw a preview for it recently and it looked good.
B002M9WW30|1.0|i got this for 23 dollars now i see its now 40 dollars well it works half assed. the movies # 1-3 work but 4-6 did not. i have a ps3 and it did not read the disks so i baught a sony bluray player and it did the same thing. so i got the movies replaced and the same thing happend so theese must be cheap knockoffs or something. you must need a 400 dollar bluray player to run theese horrable quality disks.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I watch this everytime it is on TCM.  Now I can watch it with my Daughter.  We have the newer vesion with Meg Ryan.  I liked it, but not as well as the original
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is the second best first person shooter on iOS the best would be MC3 because they have better graphics and more weapons and very time I log out of online I lose credits about 100-300.
B003SI6C4O|4.0|Denzel Washington is the always the cool, calm, and collected authority figure, and plays that role to the utmost in this film. He is unassuming, yet always in control - just the person you would want to have around in a crisis.<br /><br />Any story based on the premise of time travel is ultimately absurd, since the very idea raises so many conundrums and logical fallicies as to make time travel seem ridiculous as a plot mechanism. The one exception to that statement is Jules Verne's Time Machine, which was more credible than any time travel saga since. In this film, not even the ivy-league physicists who concocted the whole scheme in the film can make anything more than crude sophomoric observations about the mechanics of time. Nevertheless, the film is well-made and creates a credible story line as long as one is willing to suspend disbelief in the utter silliness of time travel in the first place. The personal relationship between the stars adds another entertaining dimension, and the film ends up being fun and suspenseful, for which I credit the director and cast if not the writers.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This series is maybe ok for middle school children but I would not recommend it to younger children who might not get the humor and might have poor role models. Kids love it but they also would love candy for breakfast every day. I don't think it is a healthy influence.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I watched and mostly enjoyed the first two seasons, and the intrigue of seeing early 20th century British culture in HD was enough to pull me through some of the painfully formulaic moments and annoying acting tics (like Cora's accent). But the period novelty starts to wear off by the middle of Season 3, as does any sense that there's an overarching plan to the writing--or at least enough to outweigh the show's business interests. Instead, the plot twists are clearly designed to keep actors they need and get rid of actors (not characters) they can't keep, and it's all too transparent to suspend disbelief anymore or to emotionally invest in the storyline (and if you can't do that, what's the point of watching?). On the bright side, having a show fall off like this gives it a form of closure, and I come out happy for the brief escape but with zero gumption to re-up my interest for Season 4.
B0044CG71G|3.0|As much as I like Olivia and as hot as Anna Torv is, the whole \\"Olivia/not-Olivia\\" thing is so thin it is about to fall off or right through the tolerance table. Now it's cartoons in Ep. 19... just kill the bitch! There's still one left, right?<br />Here we have the brains of the millennium figuring out time travel, inter-dimensional travel, mind-melding, but they too damn stupid to see the false Olivia? I just don't buy it anymore. It was a thin literary device to start with, and distracts me from believing in the characters. In my opinion it was unnecessary, overdone, overdrawn, and not believable. It's the same thing I guess as no one 'recognizing' Clark Kent as Mr. S, but it is driving me crazy!<br />She's still the hottest actor on tv.<br />p.s.<br />I apologize for using words such as \\"opinion\\" as they seem to trigger those god-awful pop-up obnoxious and totally irrelevant ads on this site. I HATE THEM. Not my fault, sorry.

1932907009|5.0|Helps you plot out your pacing so that your book never drags! Provides a template telling you exactly what needs to be happening at what point in your book by what page. (Obviously YOU created the outline for the action.) You can even place the template over and existing manuscript to show you what needs to be cut, added to or reshaped to make it tauter. Highly recommend to any author.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Bought this for my sister.  We watch Dexter all the time.  She was here over the holidays and saw 1 episode.  She had never watched any Dexter episodes at all.  She loved it.  I bought her Season 5 which was one of my favorites.  She was starting the 3rd disc yesterday.  She is hooked.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the book, the characters, and the ending best of all! Amazing story and I couldn't put it down!
1439102813|3.0|I read this book, despite having 4 other books from the library, because it was interesting enough for me to WANT to see what this woman experienced. It did not arouse heart-wrenching feelings, which I expected, and although I was a bit saddened and enlightened, I couldn't help but wonder why this woman didn't go through certain stages--like anger--well, there was a little, but again the emotional quality just wasn't there so it didn't seem too believable. I did read it straight through tonight but would of liked to have felt more passionately moved by it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Picks up Jamie and Claire's story without missing a beat. A page turner in spite of providing lots of detail and description that I might not sit through with another author. Just a really great read. (My second time reading the series.)

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Full of history, adventure and jaw dropping surprises, I couldn't put this down. You will fall in love with the heroine, despite her odd nature. Skip the movie...it's a huge let down after reading the books.

B002ZG997C|5.0|Great Story.....  I've watched it several times and pick up somthing new each time.  Really have to pay attention in this movie.
030758836X|3.0|WARNING: What's about to follow is a review from a reader who only made it to page 220 and abandoned the book, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't read it! It's superbly written, witty, dark, and twisted. Yet I couldn't identify with the characters and couldn't finish it. Here is why.<br /><br />When I picked up Gone Girl, I was ready for a sick twisted thrill of some mystery and perhaps madness and perhaps even a glimpse into a psychopathic mind. I got none. It had a promising start but by about page 10 I started wondering who the characters really were, turning page after page, waiting for some glimpse inside, and it was eluding me. Stuff was happening, but emotionally it was empty. I needed to know WHY the characters were doing what they were doing. I read some more, hoping to find out, and then I started sensing something fishy, like there was a mystery but it was too thinly veiled. In short, the big reveal on page 219, THE BIG TWIST, I saw it coming from the very beginning. I guess that was my last straw.<br /><br />Gone Girl is a story told in two alternating story lines, one by Nick, the husband, and one by Amy, the wife, both narratives about 6 years apart in time that collide close to the end (I skimmed to last chapter.) It's a hoppity game-like narration with very choppy, snarky, and sometimes very bitter observations, about marriage, about love, about life in general. At times it almost sounded like a bitter black-and-white observations of two teenagers who think they're adults. I'm okay with bitterness, but this bitterness felt like it had no ground, there was not enough meat for me to believe as to WHY these two people would do the things they did to each other. I wanted backstory, I wanted to know their real pain. Well, I didn't find it by page 220, so I abandoned the book.<br /><br />BUT! Don't listen to me. If you're looking for a light snarky oh-my-god-what-will-happen-next read, go for it. If you're not the type that likes to drill deep into a book's meaning, you might like it. Remember, this is simply my personal opinion, and that's all there is to it. It might not have been a perfect book for me, but it might be a perfect book for you. It was too much unfounded unreasoned bitterness for me, that's all.book's meaning, you might like it. Remember, this is simply my personal opinion, and that's all there is to it. It might not have been a perfect book for me, but it might be a perfect book for you. It was too much unfounded unreasoned bitterness for me, that's all.
B008NEMN0K|1.0|When I ordered this with the other 3d movies, I thought that it would be the Best One.  I ordered it because I loved the regular Blu Ray version, so much.  Sadly it does not have that much 3D to it.  I thought with all the top action scenes, it would have lots of 3D, jumping out at you.  This version of 3D is mediocre at best.  If, it had been more than $19.95, I would be returning it.  As, this is a one on a scale of 10.
B005LAII80|5.0|I saw the trailer for this movie, and it was discouragingly dark. But I had fond memories of the original JUDGE DREDD, so I gave the new one a try. It is much brighter and appealing than the trailer. Also, the story differs from the original's. The setting is similar, a crime-infested megalopolis isolated from a radioactive wasteland, and Judge Dredd is similar, though his uniform and bike are dingy compared to the original's gold and chrome. But the new movie offers a good deal more that is new, including an element of science-fiction ESP.<br /><br />JUDGE DREDD's plot progressed with a background of political corruption. DREDD's action occurs mostly in one of the megalopolis's skyscrapers, reminiscent of something from Peter F. Hamilton. Maybe that indicates that some science fiction screenwriters are beginning to do their homework by indulging in SERIOUS science fiction, which you can do only by reading. Anyway, it allows for an element of suspense when the hero and heroine become trapped in one of those gigantic buildings.<br /><br />The three main characters are done very well. It was good to see Lena Headey. She was fine as the heroine in the TV series TERMINATOR - THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, and as a villainess in DREDD, she is superb. Though I won't say that the new actor for Dredd was better than Mr. Stallone, he was perfectly adequate (Karl Urban, familiar as Dr. McCoy in the new STAR TREK movies). But, despite my celibate tendencies, I confess a magnetic attraction to Dredd's sidekick, Anderson. Young and blond, a paragon of the girl next door, as you expect from a star, she scintillates.

0743298020|5.0|I found this to be a compelling story that kept me reading.  The characters were well developed and sympathetic and I found myself wanting things to turn out well for them and curious about what would happen next.  This is the first novel by this author that I have read and I enjoyed the telling of the tale and would recommend it.

B005UBNKZG|5.0|This is an amazing deal for me, Unlocked means that its sooooo easy to overclock and as long as you have a GOOD heat sync. I have mine clocked to 4.5Ghz with ZERO heating issues.. Paired with a GTX660 it made a very affordable rig for under 1200 bucks (including monitor and keyboard)..
B004N84Y66|4.0|This is a very charming novel and very much Jane Austen. My favorites are Pride and Prejudice ,of course, and Emma.  The characters in this book are not quite as comical as Mrs. Bennett or Emma's papa, but none the less fascinating depictions of English society in the 1800s.  The illustrations make my desire to visit England someday stronger.  JANE Austen will always be one of my favorite authors. If only she had had more time to spin her magic pen.
0345803493|5.0|I loved it, would highly recommend this book.  You must read all three books.  I do hope she writes more like this.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater.  Definitely the kind of movie you can watch over and over and over again
0345803485|4.0|This is a review for all three books. I have to say that I loved the idea of the book and I loved the Hero, Christian Grey. However, I was not impressed with Anastasia Steele. SHE is just as Fifty Shades as Christian is but no one hits on that. One minute she's declaring her love and deciding she's going to work with him on their relationship but then 5 pages later she's judging him and giving up and being a complete b****. The whole story is based on him getting over his past, however she is always judging him and putting him down because he hasn't been able to change enough for her within the few months they've known each other. Drove me crazy throughout the series. What kind of love is that?<br />  Honestly, I was very tempted to put the series aside because of Steele. I chose not to because I do love the plot, and Christian had me swooning every five minutes lol! I also thought the sex scenes were fun and certainly gave me some ideas, which my hubby definitely appreciates!<br />  I would recommend this to mature audiences with a fun read in mind. Don't take it too seriously like I did lol! I was ready to smack Ana quite a few times...
1936608898|5.0|This book is a 30 day program which is based in the \\"Paleo\\" Diet. It will help wean (actually you have to go pretty much cold turkey) off some foods which in the end make you feel really bad. It is awesome. I feel great (my insides feel really good). And, as an added side bonus I've lost weight. I have been mostly on the program since last summer. Whenever I wonder off the program I just don't feel as good. For me it is totally working. One thing I love about these guys is that they are not legalistic. They really try to make it work for real people and give your brain reasons why. Most of the foods that are restricted are because many people are allergic to them. There is NO limit to how much you can eat...just what you can eat. I think it can all be summed up with...garbage in, garbage out...good REAL food in, good healthy body out. Love it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book book. Better than the movie. I normally don't read a lot but this one captured my attention to the point where, after the 12th chapter, I couldn't put it down.!!!!! 5stars!!

B009UNGYHG|5.0|One of the biggest complaints I have had with hands-free earpieces is what to do with them when you aren't using them.  How do you transport them, carry them, etc. when not in use (i refuse to walk around with a Bluetooth earpiece hanging on my ear all day long)?  I have owned a variety of earpieces over the years (mostly from the Plantronics line), and have always struggled with storing them without damaging them.<br /><br />The most recent earpiece I owned from the Plantronics line was the Voyage 975, and it comes with a storage case that doubles as a portable charger...just like this one.  Unfortunately my Voyager 975 didn't last too long, and I had to send it back on 2 occasions to Plantronics (customer service is great by the way).  The problem with that solution was the docking mechanism was still a stub micro-USB connector that you had to fit exactly right for the earpiece to dock.  On my second Voyager 975, the connector in the earpiece broke.  On my first Voyager 975, the connector on the case itself broke.  On that particular model, charger with a case concept was a very good idea, just not durable.<br /><br />My newest earpiece was the Motorola Sliver which has a very small form factor, extremely comfortable, and a charger / case combo unit.  This is a very well executed case/charger combination using a conductive type of charge.  However, the earpiece itself is, although comfortable, not very good.  Everyone I have called has a hard time hearing me.<br /><br />I decided to go after the Plantronics Voyage Legend because I have had mostly good luck with Plantronics.  My only hesitation was that it didn't have a case, until I saw this little goody.  A storage case and portable charger in one (like the Motorola Sliver) that stores and protects the Voyage Legend earpiece.  This is a very nice implementation!  The case is simple, yet provides everything you need.  It is about the size of a deck of cards, uses conductive charging through magnets (the magnets also hold the earpiece securely in the case), and has 2 indicator lights - battery status of case & battery status of earpiece.  Simple!  According to the specs, this is supposed to charge your earpiece an additional 2 times (14 hours of talk time total).  I have used this for about 3 weeks now, and I have seen that this is accurate.<br /><br />If you have purchased the Voyager Legend earpiece, this is a must-have item.  It provides a very nice protective case, and will keep your earpiece charged and ready for when you need it.  No need to carry a power source with you for weekend trips anymore!<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish Plantronics offered this as a combo to buy with the earpiece itself.so hold the earpiece securely in the case), and has 2 indicator lights - battery status of case & battery status of earpiece.  Simple!  According to the specs, this is supposed to charge your earpiece an additional 2 times (14 hours of talk time total).

B0018STVHQ|5.0|The director played with the historical facts a little bit; but then again, who knows exactly what happened that long ago.  All in all, it was a really good movie.
B006BXTOFC|2.0|I feel like this band should just release singles and stop trying to make albums.  This is definitely one of the more listenable albums they have, but it's still nothing I feel like I ever need to hear again.  Hear 2 or 3 Black Keys songs, and you've heard them all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I only just started playing this game today but already I'm really liking this game. I don't think that I van say anything bad about this game other than maybe one thing: the graphics. If you pay attention to the tail of the horse it looks like a floating stick .. But its really something minor. Overall a really great game!
B003VIWO9I|5.0|Terry Pratchett's humor is based on a deep understanding of real life. Every laugh is backed by some deeper truth.
B001VEE5KK|3.0|This movie will make you think.  It showed what someone will do, or allow themselves to indure, to protect others.  The time frame is from the holocast in Germany.  Watch it with that time frame in mind and you just like might like it.  It's not an action or thriller movie.
1439153663|3.0|The purchase and delivery of the book was great.  I just didn't think it was that great of a read.  Contrary to comments inside the<br />cover, it was no &#34;Gone With the Wind.,&#34;

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Stuck at home one day I purchased this film on demand and proceeded to watch it three times, then buy it from good ole amazon.com.  This is a charming film intertwining and an unusual number of characters and storylines with glorious cinematography capturing the essence of the land of in which the story takes place.  The script and editing are topnotch, the actors all prominent and superb, everything all a great film should offer right in place.  No wonder this unlikely candidate for box office stardom (given the age group represented by the cast) took off and became a smash.  I've talked to many friends about it and everyone says the same thing: This is a film you can watch 10 times and still in something new in each time.  And that's why I bought it!
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This game reminds me of Chu Chu Rocket, which I'm mad at my self for missing as a free app of the day. It is kind of a reverse obstacle course as you start at the cheese and make a path to the mouse. In the few levels I have played, I have had to double back over switches to get doors open and just now a cat was introduced. Very good.
B00932A2MC|2.0|&#34;Kitsch&#34; is not just the actor's name, it also describes the obvious attempts to be a sort of 21st century surface warfare Top Gun with Independence Day aliens thrown in. You know how the movie ends before the first 10 minutes are up. It's still fun to watch as the FX cover a lot of sins in the plot and acting. Rent, don't buy.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I suspect the case to be counterfeit. After using the case for one week it broke. The screen always had bubbles however when tested it was waterproof. After 1 week the case fell apart. The volume switch didn't work. The pink back was a little see through and the gray started to get discolored.  We went to Best buys and bought the same case, the color was different and the quality was far better. The lettering on the back was bigger than on the new one. The case was easier to get off than the new one.The feel of the case was different. It felt like hard plastic. The screen protector had a grid across it.

Then literally not moments ago its USB connection went out and now I have to have it bent and taped tight so I can use it until I buy a Razer mouse.

0143036424|5.0|Although I watched the first season of Longmire on TV, this was the first book I read about the lawman. I wanted to start with the first book and read them in order. In fact, I just ordered the second one today.<br /><br />Craig Johnson writes with a great deal of detail and this certainly isn't a fast-paced page turner. But it is an intriguing indepth look at the characters and the rugged area where they live. I liked that the story had a bit of the spiritual and supernatural, especially when Longmire was in rescue mode. The Cold Dish isn't for the faint of heart, but delivers a powerful story that is not only difficult to put down, but to forget after the last page is read. Johnson is a top-notch author and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Mic picks up sound well, and the quality of sound is great. I don't know much about professional grade equipment but this was more than great for semi-pro interviews, recordings etc. Also a fan of the on/off switch
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This was the first of John Scalzi's novels that I've read. Looking forward to reading others in the upcoming months.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you like mid-evil times you will truly enjoy this book.  I recommend starting with the first in the trilogy.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I've published two books on Kindle so far and the information in this guide was invaluable. I don't know what I would have done without it. I really appreciate that Amazon does their best to help us newly self-published enjoy success.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Anyone who remembers this story will be happy to read about this amazing young woman!  There is evil and good in our world but if we love and care enough ,good will prevail.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This about as clear an account of what war is as l have ever read about. Chris was a real life &#34;John Wayne&#34; a true American hero.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|If you like mid evil times then this book is for you. I recommend starting with the beginning of the trilogy.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|The movie leaded me to this book, it's a great story with charm! However, it also left me an unsatisfying feeling which is not a good after taste for sure. Not like that I'm not loving this book but it was just... not up to my expectation. It's definitely well developed in the first 2/3, but suddenly came to the end with only a brief touch of all these characters the author had put into the story. The relationship between Howl and Sophie was not quite convincing to me (not like the very interesting \\"friendship\\" between Shopie & Calcifer). Lovely characters and very potential plot I could only hope the story had been longer, with more magic, and details. Besides, I fall hard for Calcifer!!!
B0012CH350|5.0|This cover has survived us leaving the grill out in the rain and snow, with no effect on the grill. A great buy!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Incredibly fun game, really works your mind and coordination. I've been having a great time formulating different strategies. Graphics are surprising good, and the game itself is fluid and strong.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book on CD.  Heartwarming.  Deeply romantic yet realistic.  Kept my interest.  Brought to the forefront the very serious issue of domestic violence.  Hope that reading this will give some victim the courage to get out of a similar situation.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|I love all types of jazz.  I selected this product because of the variety it offered, and it has delivered. Tremendous sound from the Kindle HD speakers make this a very enjoyable listening experience on its own, and perfect for playing in the background when web browsing or reading books/magazines.
B000UJ48XG|5.0|I love these guys! Such a unique sound. I would love to see them live, but since they haven't traveled to Seattle yet, I will have to settle for this awesome CD. I highly recommend it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I purchased a Kindle Fire HD for my friend, which she absolutely loves.  Her favorite color is purple.  It fits perfectly and just thick enough for security and not bulky at all.
B0013XLDO0|5.0|Tift did a wonderful job with the albumn. A lot of up beat music and a spendid voice.  thanks Tift!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The actually Facebook page presentation with this app is not as convenient and easy to use as going to the web site via the Internet. Other than that, it is fine.
0765325950|5.0|Robert Jordan picked a worthy successor to complete his epic story.  Though quite long this book sprints to the finish line in a grand battle that draws to a close the end of the age.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Don't listen to the fanboys...this is a great series. Sure some of the extra CGI add-ins are a bit cheesy in episodes iv-vi, but it's trivial.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Had some second thoughts after I ordered this when I saw it on the 'Teen' list, but it turned out to be as enjoyable a book as I've read in a long time.  It's amazing how a writer can fully depict an intimate love story without gratuitous sex (the polar opposite of the 'Fifty Shades ...' trilogy) centered around cancer, dying and death and leave the reader so uplifted.  Anyone else have a 2nd choice written by John Green?
B005K17RU0|5.0|This loads fast, gives me the information I need for any location in a hurry, frequently used locations are easily loaded for easy retrieval, and the weather radar depiction is very good. It is much more convenient and quicker than trying to get weather updates on WeatherScan or the WC on TV
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sub surfers is great. I just cant stop playing it.I can tell you over and over its da bomb. GET THIS APP NOW ITS AWESOME AND FREE.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and the horses. I will recommend it to others that I know with devices. It is an awesome game.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This memoir-style adventure is made captivating by a superb writing style and the sheer magnitude of the task she undertook with little or no preparation or experience.  Gutsy lady.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I got this primarily for fun, not to take great keepsake photos, and for this purpose, it is more than adequate.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Really fun game.  Hard to master but it for sure keeps you entertained.  Showed this to my buddy and now he's hooked.  Well worth the 99 cents.
B0076DELIG|4.0|While I always enjoy a Harry Bosch novel, this one felt a little predictable. Connelly remains my favorite author, but maybe its time to work on some Mickey Haller stories before coming back to Bosch in future works. That will give Harry some time to get into some trouble that doesn't feel forced. Black Box is still a fun read and I would recommend it to old and new fans alike.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Formulaic.  Judy Densch's performance makes it worth watching, but the supposedly spectacular chases/crashes get tiresome about halfway through the film.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series is as good as it gets if a person dreams of seeing the entire Earth, but knows that will never happen. The cinematography is wonderful.  As a former geography teacher, it is a great source of information, so I recommend it to teachers and parents who home-school their children.  It is very enjoyable to watch over and over again as entertainment as well.
1456323237|5.0|Loved this book! just started getting into buddhism and i must say this book is great! not sure if its the publisher but there were some misspellings but other than that great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|every one should get this game it is better than temple run the first<br /><br />Ps I love one detection and my friend has bieber fever
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I had this game and really liked it but I accidently deleted it.I was so far into it I had to redownload it. I tried but it is taking forever
B006O2QNOU|5.0|I can't believe this movie wasn't more popular, or maybe it was and I was just living under a rock.  Either way it's a good flick if you're interested in the banking world or the housing collapse in particular.
B009FZFONO|5.0|i was skeptical b/c i am not too big into zombie shows but this show is much more than that.  i cant wait to watch every episode, i highly recommend this to everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My 5 year old loves this app and we end up talking math..something that I had not anticipated when I initially got it for my own use.
B00797MB0O|1.0|This movie was majorly depressing. Not in the sense I felt something for the characters, they were all equally awful. This was depressing because someone was given millions of dollars to produce this steaming pile of poop.<br /><br />I may be too harsh on the poop population.<br /><br />The only saving grace is that my computer went into hibernation mode near the end, which was probably the highlight of the entire flick.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|All  couples should read this book, it should be a wedding/anniversary gift to all couples. This book is a real simple way to find out what action touches your heart.
B004AQR29C|4.0|It actually had a good story line for an action adventure movie. Great cast, great acting.<br />I will get Ex-2
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I watched this together, and both very much enjoyed it. As a guy, if you can get over the &#34;it's a love story&#34; aspect, you'll really enjoy it (also, it isn't just a love story)
B0014H32MG|5.0|A seat gripper all the way through! Couldn't put it down once I started it. Belie able characters & expressive content. Another five star for King 's imagination.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is a great way to interact with people you may or may not  know.It is soooo much fun. I like to kik this chick named mackely and she is sooo awesome...kik her and find out she is an awesome person
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I read a lot of reviews posted both here and on an audiophile site I visit regularly.  It was hard to find anything negative about this DAC/Amp combo, especially considering the price.  I bought this primarly for use with my iPhone by way of a LOC connector (also by FiiO).  This little combo provides a VERY OBVIOUS improvement to soundstage, power, clarity, and white noise.  Aux-in from the phone yields 48k sample rate.  When I connected the DAC to my laptop via Toslink optical, I can sample at 96k and if I connect via USB I can sample at 192k.<br /><br />I'm using either PSB M4U 2 over-ear headphones or Shure SE-535 in-ear monitors.  Through either of these, the sound is just addictively good.  The other night, I sat for 4+ hours going through my favorite music just enjoying the improved sound provided by this FiiO DAC/Amp.  I have to say that the difference between the iPhone at 48k and the USB-to-Computer at 192k is really not that big a deal to me.  What differences there are, I don't feel outweigh the convenience of the compact size of the Amp+iPhone.  I bought this setup for when I travel, which I do 6 months out of the year.<br /><br />I'm going to cheat a little here and take a moment to boast about the PSB M4U 2 headphones.  At $400 bucks they're not the cheapest cans on the block but they are truly an audio marvel.  PSB Speakers is a Canadian company that for the past 40 years has made excellent high-end loudspeakers.  The M4U 2 headphones are not crappy ghetto blasters like the Beats.  They have spectacularly present and rich midrange and delightfully clear highs.  Sound stage is very open and transparent; I don't feel like I'm listening to sound being directly injected into my ears.  I do find they are a smidge bass-heavy on some tracks but with the FiiO, I just bump the bass down -2 and that fixes that right up.  Throw some dubstep or trance at these headphones with the FiiO set to flat and you'll have more sound than your ears can handle without so much as a hint of distortion.  Coming from competition level car audio systems, when I say loud, I mean LOUD and clear; makes your eyes go crossed on some of the sub 100hz bass notes.<br />Just so you don't think this whole review was based on listening to electronic music, I mostly (like 90% of the time) listen to Jazz, Classical, and Country/Bluegrass.  The PSBs have redefined for me what real music should sound like coming from headphones.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love this movie, and I love this CD.  I listen to it everyday.  It actually sounds better than in the film.  Everytime I listen to it, the film replays in my head.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I loved this<br /><br /> book so much it is know my top favorite book. p.s your the best author EVER!!!!!!!!!!<br /> Bye
B002QE3CTY|5.0|A very good book. This is my favorite series I've ever read. That's saying something because I've read all books in the Hunger Games series and the Percy Jackson series.<br />  I really love how the author uses the 3rd person point of view to make you feel like you really are Thomas running through the maze.<br />  Even if you don't like the 1st one, the 2nd one is alot more sunspensful and action-packed so it might be kind fun to read. But you still wouldn't like it.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I really thought this movie was going to be more funny with the director's name on it.  Kind of was a waste of time.
1400052181|5.0|The work is extraordinary and thought provoking. That we are more than just these bodies is proven over and over in this true to life and beyond life as we know it narrative. It most definately opens the door to ever evolving realities. I'm grateful for the truth.<br /><br />IfeTayo Bonner-Payne
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game!:) It is like temple run but 3 times better! All of my family likes the game except for my dad.
B005MHI0QM|4.0|Following the Frank family and the families that stayed with them through 1942 - 1944 was looked at through the eyes of a young teenager - Hollander Anne Frank.  Although the families were cut off virtually from civilization, Anne was still a normal teenager with the wonders of the world.  A bit outstpoken for her family and the others at first, Anne found her niche in writing her diary.  It was horrific what they to go through.  A very moody girl, her diary reflects this and the moods of the seven others.  But I must admit by the end of the book, I was getting a little jaded, it seemed to repeat itself over and over, but then again, most diaries are like that.  She was fortunate her father was alive to give the diary to the world.  The terrors the Jewish people went through is something that should never be forgotten.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is a fast moving murder mystery that will keep you spellbound till the very end. It is a  must read.
B009IAN56E|5.0|The CD arrived in great shape, no scratches on the CD or case. The CD arrived three days before expected arrival. I love Little Mix and these songs.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Engaging, thought provoking, realistic, hilariously funny in places, scientifically accurate.  Loved it, could not put it down once I started reading it.  Want to read more from Mr. Weir.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|worked good for a while then it just stopped going off in at the set alarm time so forget it.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|when is more recent movies. what is well done. very entertaining an interesting. we need more movies of this caliber.
B00009NQQO|2.0|I liked these for my son. They're very cute and he enjoyed shooting them in the little hoop. The only down fall is they get EXTREMELY moldy on the inside. I had to throw them all away. It was pretty gross. Even after squeezing them out and putting them in a draining tub mate, they still managed to get mass amounts of mold.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've read everything DeMille has written and loved them all.  This was a real let down for me though.  Loved the character of John Corey and his humor but this book had way too much of it to make it special.  The plot was rehashed over and over.  The historical insight was great to a point, but was getting a little irritating when it seemed to take the place of the plot.  And it was like he was trying to describe the plot, local history, character assignment in six ways to Sunday.  What the heck happened?  Where was his editor?  It's like he was forgetting what he had already wrote about.  I've loved DeMille so this is really sad for me to say these things about his book.  I've got about 15% left to read, but to be honest, I've been speed reading throught that last 10%.  I don't want to give up on it, but it is very hard to just set it aside and go on to something else.  When I seen how many pages this book was, I though alright....a nice long story with twists and angles and the style of reading that I love so well from DeMille.  But if the repeated and over analyzed storyline parts were taken out, it would have only been half the book.  I'm still a fan Mr. DeMille, but next time I will read the reviews first before purchasing.
B005HSL626|5.0|this keeps me and my 3 year old occupied all though i cant figure out how to compare my scores to friends it wont open the thing where it says compare scores with friends so i dont know what thats all about
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I love surfing as growing up in Hawaii it was part of my daily life.  This movie for anyone that loves the Ocean, good hearts and great acting.  This is the best movie I have seen this year.  I am buying the Blu Ray and I will watch it as much as my eyes will allow me to do so, as I may keep having bad &#34;Allergies&#34; each time I watch it.
B009P25TQE|5.0|Si el primero fue espectacular,este es apoteosico, es muy romantico, te eleva mas alla del cielo y te mantiene caminando entre las nubes, perfecto para compartir con la persona amada.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Read this book , strongly recommended!!! Read it wether you've been in long or short term relationship. Especially when you feel that your relationship feels doesn't good enough for you!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love angry birds i have this for my 360 as well as my kindle fire hd! great product! ..
0525953728|5.0|I am a landed immigrant and citizen for the past 49 years and my son-in-law is a Marine who has been deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, as well as all over the world. Our family has been proud of the U.S. military for the sacrifices that its men and women give every day so that we can all live in peace. Reading this book make us even prouder of our armed forces. Our family, especially our daughter who is the marine wife, have contributed money and goods to the servicemen and women on deployment so that the pain of being away from home will at least be somewhat temporarily put on the backburner. &#34;Mark Owen&#34; gave us even more reason to help our active soldiers as well as those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. It is a thrilling and exciting book which I can't put down after I started reading it. I am so glad that &#34;Mark&#34; told the story. Thank you to all the Seals and to all the men and women of our military.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Gen X  musicians and rock n roll fans will delight in this trip down memory lane. Nostalgia at its best! Thanks to Dave Grohl, the Neve board lives on.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|But this was so poorly written I did put it down and had a difficult time picking it back up. I don't consider myself a literary snob, but the poor grammar and the cliche's were overwhelming. If she bit her lip one more time I was going to scream and rip her lip off!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is alot of fun.its a challenge it really gets you thinking hard i love this game so does my 3 year old its helped her learn her colors as well
B000MQC9H4|5.0|There's just something about this movie...I watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. So much more than a love story.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like the old time favorites, and this is still a fun game.  Thanks, Amazon.  You're doing a great job.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|One of few books I stayed up all night to read. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes futuristic stories. I'm going to look for more books from this author.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was well written and a lesson for overly protective parents.  Some of the actions of the parents were abit difficult to believe, but the story was suspenseful.
1455502758|5.0|A touching look into a brilliant mind. I have always admired his vitality and courage, and especially on the final journey.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Markus Suzak has turned out a masterpiece in this story of an orphaned girl, Liesel, whose foster parents do not fit the mold of their antisemitic, Nazified town. The girl's challenges -- the loss of her real parents and her younger brother, her accustoming herself to a new mother who can be off-the-charts loony, a town that will not brook variations from its norms, and her own battle to teach herself to read and write -- make for a page turner. It is not without hope: her relationship with her new \\"Papa,\\" a man who teaches by example love of one's fellow (even one who is hunted down for being Jewish) is a vital component of the book. The sympatico between Liesel and one of the downtrodden is meaningful and poignant, and even Death becomes a sympathetic character, quite an accomplishment given his job.<br /><br />Written in the first person from the viewpoint of the Angel of Death, this book is so well-written I ended up with over a hundred underlined passages. There's hardly a page on which either a whole exerpt or a turn of wrenching phrase does not capture the reader.<br /><br />I'd say that the theme may be a little adult-like for a Young Adult audience, but I may be behind the times. In any case, The Book Thief is unforgettable, and, of the 100+ Young Adult novels I've read in the past six or eight months, head and shoulders above the rest.
B00A6SZRGS|5.0|I love the album of BVB 'cause it's different then what they used to make. It's something new and it's a lot of fun.<br />If you want to read a full review on the album you can go to iheartcore. co .uk/5stars .html (remove spaces)

B003G4W49C|4.0|I flew through this book and literally couldn't put it down.  Is it realistic?  No.  But that's why it's called a novel.  I enjoyed it very much.
B009G8GRX6|2.0|I am used to big epic songs from Muse, and this just didn't fit the bill. &#34;Madness&#34; was ok, but quiet, and I felt like I was forcing myself to listen to the album instead of enjoying the music.
0743526937|1.0|So I get this in the mail and open it up - and low and behold its missing a disc. Thats like ripping out 50 pages from a book and expecting you to follow whats going on.<br /><br />So I tried to contacted the manufactuer... a week later - still no response. Theres no phone number, just a form online.<br /><br />Horrible.
B000VXJYFI|5.0|There is enough reviews here about whether the Band of Gypsies was as good as The Experience. WHO CARES!! This review is for audiphiles thinking about buying the Red vinyl version of this album by Capital records. Do it! It sounds great! I am usually picky about whether the new albums I buy are sourced from the original master tapes and I can usaully tell the difference between a \\"digital album\\" or \\"analog\\" when listening. This one I really can't? athough this being a modern Capital release \\"its digital I am sure\\". It sounds better than some of my old 70's Jimi Reprise albums! Some of which are simply awful. Here we have lots of detail, warmth, decent mids and highs and ANALOG LIKE BOTTOM END! especially for a very old \\"live recording\\"! Cool Red Vinyl Too! Essential Hendrix album for any true fan! Capital/EMI most of your vinyl re-issues are cheap quality CD like rip-offs but not this one, good work!!
B0000549B0|5.0|Who doesn't like Jimmy Stewart? It came quickly and was packaged nice. The case is not flimsy and the disc seems to be a quality disc, as is the case. The movie has played well over 5 times w/o any mishaps and a very good picture. I happen to love this movie and me and the grand kids enjoy it each time we watch it.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I bought this on a whim, and I am definitely glad that I did. The first 5 songs are amazing, and while some of the songs are a little disjointed, Imagine Dragons has a different enough sound that I don't feel as if I am listening to the same stuff that's on the radio all the time. I could listen to &#34;Radioactive&#34; all day long.
0979019753|5.0|Yes, there is not a ton of new ideas here (Remember there are no new secrets to success anyway). For my wife and I, Elrod's way of putting it all has motivated us to start our days exceptionally! Great book for procrastinators like me.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|One of my favorite musicians, he is unbelievably talented and this cd, definitely one of his best, not a bad song on it, worth every penny.

B005FISBTO|5.0|I read the reviews and skipped the ads at the beginning as some viewers warned that they would give away the end of the series.  Dexter, as usual did not disappoint.  The first episode was Dexter trying normal but it soon got back to his version of normal.  You also notice a development in his style and a perfection of craft.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like this game, but after a certain point if you don't pay money you cant really do much.....Very irritating!!!!

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. I am very drawn to stories of the Holocaust and the amazing survival stories. This book had a wonderful story to tell and it was a pleasure to read.
0618680004|5.0|I’m fascinated by religion and the need we humans have for it. And I suspect that many others are as well. However, as any culturally fluent individual understands (at least tacitly), it’s not exactly the choice topic to discuss at cocktail parties with guests whom you don’t know very well. Unless, of course, you want to risk being perceived as a gauche individual. In a similar fashion to politics (yet more intense), religion has a tendency to escalate tensions between people in a fiery way that usually ends in a nonsensical shouting match.<br /><br />That religion tends to create controversy is not, however, a sufficient reason to avoid being critical of it, even publicly.  I think is because cultural fashions come and go.  Consider this: I suspect at one point in American history it was socially taboo to openly criticize slave owners too.  Just imagine if no one had the courage to rock the boat with slave owners (think “master-slave morality“).  Other people’s religious beliefs, both intentionally and inadvertently, affect all of our our personal lives, often in negative ways.  In other words, the foolish beliefs of others can cause very real harm to innocent bystanders.  My question is this: should rational people politely respect these types of beliefs?<br /><br />Richard Dawkin’s book, The God Delusion, is a brave, yet much needed, polemical critique of religion (even moderate religion) for modern day atheists. And parts of it certainly come off as offensive. Offending others, however, is not categorically a thing to avoid doing. In fact, sometimes it’s mandatory! As Daniel Dennett wrote:<br /><br />I listen to all these complaints about rudeness and intemperateness, and the opinion that I come to is that there is no polite way of asking somebody: have you considered the possibility that your entire life has been devoted to a delusion? But that’s a good question to ask. Of course we should ask that question and of course it’s going to offend people. Tough.<br /><br />Perhaps you’ve heard a line of reasoning similar to the following: you’re an atheist (?), well then, you must be an immoral heathen too! Even an amateur logician would be able to tell you that this argument is absurd, yet I frequently hear variations of this argument muttered from the mouths of people who are otherwise very intelligent.<br /><br />Dawkins asserts that atheists can be “happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled” and he is absolutely correct. It’s not within the scope of this essay to provide the scientific evidence behind why this absurd claim needn’t necessarily be true; however, I do intend to use this anecdote to make a further claim (and one that Dawkin’s promotes too).  The current fashion in America is to view atheism as a dirty word that is associated with some nasty connotations.<br /><br />In America, it’s acceptable to say you reject the gods and tenets of certain religions, but heaven forbid you call yourself an “atheist”. The problem, however, is that there is some confusion over what atheism really is, because there are at least two ways to think about atheism.<br /><br />Here is how Wikipedia defines atheism:<br /><br />&#34;Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities. In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.&#34;<br /><br />So in the first sense, almost every human is an atheist of some gods. In the second sense, atheist is a word for the dogmatic belief in something we cannot yet prove with empirical evidence or logic. I believe that atheists (at least intelligent ones) use the term in the broad sense when discussing religion. I concede, however, that when the term is used dogmatically in the second sense, it can be as offensive as religion itself is. Allow me, then, to reveal my personal bias and religious views since they certainly influence what I’m writing in this essay. I am committed to thefirst kind of atheism.  There are many different fashionable euphemisms to describe the type of atheist I am.  However, if I must use one, I prefer “possibillian“.<br /><br />Dawkins, in a witty fashion, elucidates on the first type of atheism when he wrote the following. “I have found it an amusing strategy, when asked whether I am an atheist, to point out that the questioner is also an atheist when considering Zeus, Apollo, Amon Ra, Mithras, Baal, Thor, Wotan, the Golden Calf and the Flying Spaghetti Monster. I just go one god further.”  In other words, if one is willing to reject any of these gods, then that individual is an atheist in at least one sense of the word.  And what methodology does one use to reject these types of gods?  Shouldn’t this same methodology be used to evaluate all gods?  I’ll leave it to the reader to ruminate over the logical implications of this point.<br /><br />Along with atheism, “God” itself is a confusing word that can have subtle, but distinctly different meanings. To some children (and sadly to some adults too), God is a Colonel Sanders looking figure who sits on a cloud and interferes in our lives (by helping people win football games for example). But to renown scientific figures like Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, the word God is often used to describe the supreme mystery that science cannot yet (or never will) explain.<br /><br />As such, it’s entirely disingenuous to equate these two usages as equal.  A theist’s version of God is much different than, say, a deist’s or a pantheist’s. When scientific geniuses, like Einstein, used the word “God”, then, it does not necessarily imply that they meant it in the same context that today’s theists would have us believe.  Although, theists obviously have an incentive to have us believe otherwise in order to support their goofy beliefs.<br /><br />According to Dawkins, Einstein didn’t believe in a personal God. However, there is a reason to believe that Einstein may have been an agnostic. When Einstein said or wrote things like “God does not play dice”, he was not speaking literally though. Religious texts run deep in most people’s literary background and, as such, we often use religious terminology metaphorically and poetically. Even atheists of the dogmatic variety inadvertently do this on occasion.<br /><br />I think many critics of Dawkins, especially those who haven’t read his work, unfairly accuse him of attacking all notions of “God”. He’s not. In fact, he makes it explicitly clear that he is out to attack the theists’ version of God and not Einsteinian versions of God.  And as I alluded to earlier, if one is already willing to reject some gods based on lack of evidence or logic, why not follow the same methodological and logical implications that would reject theistic notions of God as well?<br /><br />Strangely, many people are quick to protect the sacred irrationality of religion, again, particularly in America. I have my own theory as to why this is and it relates closely to Argumentative Theory. My reasoning goes like this. Arrogance affronts us, even if we know that the arrogant person is correct (actually, I think it affronts us more so in people who are correct). And we humans have this fascinating self-preservation mechanism that often lets our ego get in the way of searching for truth.  In other words, we’d rather win than be right.  As such, I suspect that this is why many open and liberal minded people come to the defense of religion (even if they don’t agree with it) and dislike the militarism they perceive in people like Dawkins. They’re simply looking to argue with someone and want to defend the religious, whom they likely feel are ill equipped to defend themselves in argumentation.<br /><br />The trouble with this sort of defensive passivity towards religion, though, is that real harm is inflicted on real people because of foolish and irrational beliefs (read some history books for examples). Religion can (and has been) used to justify doing a lot of harmful things (again, history books are littered with examples). If we allow ourselves to be sensitive to some absurd faith based claims, then how can we shun other ones that are equally as absurd, but culturally different? For instance, some religions have faith that illegal narcotics allow them to come into contact with their God. Should we make a legal exception for these individuals?  How about for prayers in schools? How can the open-minded person deny these individuals their right to worship their God, where ever and when ever they choose? For this reason, I think Dawkins makes a compelling case for actively fighting against religion’s influence in places where it doesn’t belong, namely public places.<br /><br />In the end, Dawkins reminded me that religion stems from the uniquely human and narcissistic desire to believe that the universe was created for our benefit.  News flash: it wasn’t.  Science tells us that we are incidental and accidental.  Not surprisingly, this thought makes some people uncomfortable.  The point of science isn’t to make people comfortable though, it’s to discover truth.  Personally, I think the great Umberto Eco offers up some consoling words to those who embrace their atheism: “When men stop believing in God, it isn’t that they then believe in nothing: they believe in everything.”that Einstein may have been an agnostic.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love romance stories that Sparks always does so well at.  This one was a little different because of the mystery involved.  I've also seen the movie which I enjoyed even tho critics did not give it a good review. Sparks is my favorite author even tho I'm not an avid reader.  i don't have time to sit and read on a daily basis.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Hilarious, Serious, Light, Dark, Family, Strangers. Each episode has some of this for everyone to appreciate. I like the fact that there is the simple idea of people with the same problems (love and war) in the past as in the future. I love how they smoothly used the idea of cowboys in space without the aliens or heavy cgi. I'm sad that it was ended because it had a lot of potential.

0316056898|5.0|Delivered in a dry, faux no-nonsense style (Thats a thing. I just made that up.), Tina Fey is hilarious. I recommend this one to anyone who wants to practice keeping a straight face while listening to the audiobook while fitness-walking past building security at your workplace. That, or getting away from the serious for a good tongue-in-cheek chuckle.
B00A9X7X6C|3.0|I'm a big Bruce Willis fan.  I bought this not knowing too much about it.  I was not impressed.<br /><br />The overarching plot is neat; cool time traveling sci-fi concept.  The details weren't flushed out well, and I think the writers know this - there's actually a scene where one character starts asking another a bunch of why questions and it breaks down into &#34;just stop asking, that's just the way it is&#34;.  A bit of a creative cop-out.  Several typical time-travel break downs.<br /><br />The acting was &#34;meh&#34;.  I never really cared about any of the characters.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is just way too easy--once you've done it a few times, you can figure it out within a few seconds.

B00433TO52|4.0|What could be wrong with the complete works of Shakespeare for two bucks? The only think I can find is that the lines are not numbered. If you need this for a class, that could be a problem. Otherwise, even if you are a Shakespeare denier, this is great.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I love MLP: FiM but this app blows, I;m glad it was frre so I didn't waste my money. If you have cash to blow on games then go ahead but I was not a fan.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I'm a nerdy middle-aged guy that really enjoys the show 30 Rock.  I figured this would have humor of a similar style and would maybe give insight into the show.<br /><br />I'm not really feeling that.<br /><br />It's mostly TF talking about her hang-ups and self-esteem issues and how she's dealt with them and got on with her successful life.  Theres humor, but it's not the style I was looking for.<br /><br />I think I'm just the wrong audience for this book.  I could see this being pitched as an inspirational book.  I would expect young women and/or actors looking for a role model to enjoy this more.  There's a lot of focus on dealing with eccentric personalities and drama and toughing it out.<br /><br />Just my take on it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is so much easier and faster then having to get up, get the dictionary, and page through it to find your word.  While usually Kindle books have built in definitions for words, they sometimes miss some of the more esoteric ones.
0810983915|5.0|My son loves these books and movies and this was a book for his collection of them.  He has read the books over and over and loves them.  Nice hardcover will keep the book nice for years to come.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I'm enjoying Season 2, but not as much as Season 1. The story lines and featured cases in the Season 1 were much more interesting - little vingettes that were great 'stand alone.'<br />Season 2 is focusing on the firm drama and the cases are secondary which is too bad since this is a show about a law firm/lawyers. The over focus on the drama is not really conducive to developing the characters as individuals. Ego, revenge and competition are the pretty one dimensional themes.<br /><br />That said, its still a very good show. I'll keep watching in hopes that they stop focusing on the 'soap opera' and start focusing on cases that reveal ethics and principles of characters.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I'm glad I bought the first two seasons of which I have watched one.  If not seeing the first one I would be lost on all the characters of whom there are a lot to follow.<br />It's a very interesting program.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is amazing how often there are two tiles alike that can be played and you just cannot see them!  Fortunately, the game allows you to get hints up to 3 times per game.  Neat sound effects too, and many, many different games.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|This is a must for tight areas!  Before, we had to move around the living room to make our kinect happy then we ended up kicking things, not good.  This has made the tight space we have, just perfect to play kinect.  It snaps right on and you're ready to play!  What a great invention!
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This is a great film to watch for anyone who is a film buff or at all interested in Hitchcock or Psycho.  Hopkins portrayal of Hitchcock was unbelievable to the point were I thought Hitchcock was playing himself.  His delivery to a certain extent will remind viewers much of his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter.  Helen Mirren\\"s performance is just as astounding and really captures the real life version of Hitchcock's wife.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys bio pictures or just looking for a good watch.
1400067820|2.0|Taleb brings a unique and interesting idea to the table, the idea of chaos improving and strengthening certain systems and paradigms. The idea itself intrigued me enough to commit to reading the book. He has excellent examples and does well building and defining antifragile. Unfortunately, the book began to break down after the first book (he titles sections of his work as \\"books\\") for me.<br /><br />First, his arrogance and vitriolic writing style wore on me. Often times they are unnecessary and serve only to degrade himself. Disagreeing with wall street investors, doctors, and other \\"fragilistas\\" (or rather people to perscribe to a fragile way of thinking) is fine. In fact he brings up several good examples of short-sightedness in these cases, especially the 2008 collapse. However, it does not justify his use of cursing, directly insulting their intelligence, or rambling inefficient explanations of their incompetence (which often are heavy on commentary and light on evidence). The most telling passage of his obvious anger problems come from him describing an outburst during a scientific convention in Korea. It is bad enough that he apparently jumped up on stage and yelled at others in French temporarily (he was so angry he switched by accident), giving me the image of Kanye West going onto the stage at the 2012 MTV movie awards. Worst of all, he makes no apologies for this behavior to his readers. Anybody who did something like that and felt no shame after cooling down suggests a person with anger issues. Often these issues work their way into the book and make it hard to get through a paragraph without him insulting someone.<br /><br />Second, he has not done enough research to make the sweeping broad statements he constantly makes. There is plenty to look at, but I will look at his view of doctors and medicine. As a medical student, I am not a doctor, but I have a strong foundation of medicine. Far more than Taleb. The idea of iatrogenics and accidental medicinal discovery. Iatrogenic is a medical term for harm caused by the doctor. Less literally, it can be any harm as a result of treatment, such as catching a drug-resistant bug while in the hospital, or amputating the wrong leg. This certainly happens. Medicine is also in the process of correcting the largest offenders which include over-prescription of anti-biotics and drug dispensing or recording errors. However, Taleb is wrong about the use of blood pressure medications being iatrogenic. Doctors focus on blood pressure because many MANY studies have shown that having a blood pressure below 130/80 has large effects on longevity, specifically heart attack and stroke #1 and #3 leading causes of death in the US. Medical research, well aware of the flaws of over-prescribing has even examined outcomes in multi-drug regimens and found that the good outweighed the bad. They had drug interactions but they lived longer. Also, medicine will admit when it does things simply because of convention. There are several algorithms and medical interventions that are untested for efficacy often stay that way for reasons beyond our control. Trials of hemorrhagic aneurysm treatment is more of an art than science simply because there are far fewer people that die from it, and studies are harder to do. Also, his claim that medicine only gains new medicine unintentionally from other fields is bogus. Serendipity can happen, and pharmaceutical companies also recognize discoveries of medicine in other fields. Viagra, which is certainly a black swan of drugs, was discovered while doing a medical trial as a blood pressure drug.<br /><br />Lastly, Taleb takes too long to get to the point. I found gems in his thoughts, but they were buried under anger, commentary, and a need for verbose examples and explanations that often times had only a partial grounding in real events. I found myself skipping pages simply because the idea could have been condensed down to a paragraph with no loss of informationby cutting out his opinion. He is a brilliant writer that will be inhibited by his arrogance and anger.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|There are lots of apps with white noise or relaxation sounds, but this one is unique in that you can combine many different sounds.  For example, you like the seashore?  How about some wind chimes added to the crashing of the waves?  Ingenious.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|What an amazing insight to the harshness of those times. I very much enjoyed it once I got going although it took a couple of chapters to do so.
1939416019|1.0|I'm all for someone taking the time to try and write something, it can't be easy but don't put some absolutely mediocre trash out there. This book is over priced and I wouldn't recommend this book at 99 cents. For that matter I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even if it was free.<br /><br />Which gets me to my 2nd point. &quot;Omg it's like Robert Jordan and Tolkien had a baby who nursed on G. R.R. Martin's teet and was raised by  the loving couple Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.&quot; Seriously.. &quot;I couldn't put it down, the new supreme emperess of fantasy has arrived!&quot;..etc.  Seriously...look at these reviews, ridiculous. There is absolutely no way this book at best gets a 2 star rating.<br /><br />This is the quality of writing I'd expect from a enthusiastic but not particularly skilled 10th grader.  It has a ok story idea in general but just terrible execution.<br /><br />I have never rated a book on this site, but after being scammed out of my money (yes I know I can get it refunded) I felt it my obligation to the reading community to post this.<br /><br />Side note: I personally, don't get offended by grammar, as long as the story is up to par and entertaining. But for anyone who loses there (see what I did their) mind over such, then all the more reason to avoid this book.<br /><br />And if after all that, you still buy this book, please take the time to rate it so other readers can beware. That is all.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Well written and easy to read.  He follows up his ideas with research results and worth a try for a healthy lifestyle.

B0038P59A0|5.0|Loved it - great portrayal of the Sherlock character by both Robert Downey Jr and Guy Ritchie. I especially liked the way RItchie showed us Sherlock's thought processes....his directing style is fast-paced and exciting.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The set and the series itself is awesome. However, it didn't come with the digital copy that it was supposed to, which is a slight knock against it on the quality control side. But I can live without the digital copy for the time being, especially since that wasn't what I bought this set for.<br /><br />UPDATE (2/22/13): I contacted HBO's digital copy support e-mail, and after sending them proof of my purchase, they were able to fix the problem. Pretty quick turnaround and was willing to help.

B0043RSK3K|5.0|Oliver Stone teamed up with Peter Kuznic, a historian, to provide one of the most interesting books I have read for a long time.  The neatest thing is that you will learn a lot about American History beginning with Franklin Roosevelt up through the Obama administration, the decisions they made and the impact they have had on our country.  Did we really have to drop the atomic bomb on Heroshima?  What started the cold war?  Has the Soviet Union/Russia always been as bad as we have been told?  Was the Iraq War really necessary?  Has the Obama Administrative really been effective, and if not, why not?<br /><br />Keep in mind that Oliver Stone is definitely on the liberal side, so you may choose to disagree with his research.
B0017TYPIG|4.0|Paul Newman is of course the standout performer in this celebrated movie, but the entire cast is terrific.It's more of a meditative film than an uplifting or dazzling one, but it moves along crisply with interesting plot twists. It also rewards multiple viewings with a lot of subtleties that are easily missed on the first viewing. Blu-ray technology sometimes doesn't add much to an older film, but here it really works -- deepening colors, making close-ups more revealing, and generally adding texture and freshness to the look of the film. This DVD is an especially good choice at the bargain price it seems to be selling for.

B008S4YZCO|1.0|So apparently a cookie costs 100$. I think this game stinks. First off there r just too many money options. Secondly the things too expensive. It costs 200 $ for a bar of soap. That's ridiculous. Also a dog monster costs 24 crystals. And you have to wait like forever to do things. Also they ripped me off. I had 50 crystals and the next day I had 22. No joke. I personally hate this app. Unless you have 50$ just lying around I suggest to not get this app.

Knowing what makes a habit, how a habit effects lifestyle, and how to control habits for good and not destruction, may be the most powerful knowledge in life.<br /><br />Duhigg is an engaging writer with both information and application. I have benefitted greatly from this book. As a fitness professional, I'm hoping my clients will benefit as well as we begin to identify the destructive habits in their lives and change them into healthy, life giving habits. As a business man, I'm hoping I can capture business by identifying the cues that lead people to buy fitness help.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|i do not have 19 words to describe a product that i removed before playing it so this is filler
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|This is a very easy album to under-appreciate.  It doesn't have the stand-out track(s) you would usually expect on Nick's albums, even on his mellow, ballad-filled efforts, and it is a return to a quiet and haunting sound after the higher energy Dig Lazarus! Dig!. Many of his \\"fans\\" will be disappointed by that, but I've learned not to listen to those who fancy themselves hard-core fans, and I try to listen to his albums two or three times before forming an opinion.<br /><br />On first listening, I could barely hear these songs, but now I'm into my second day straight of listening to it and I've got it on permanent loop with no desire to turn it off.  This album is just beautiful and a great addition to his catalog. If you're the sort of person who thinks an artist should continue to pathetically cling to the person he was when he was twenty, then don't buy this album and don't distract others with your reviews of it. If, on the other hand, you appreciate the evolution of a brilliant and underrated composer and a true artist, by all means grab this album and give it a chance.  I absolutely love it.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoy the sounds. It helps me get into a deep and relaxing sleep. I'm fine with the free version. I really like that you can select different sounds to go together. Highly recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Need I really say more? Read this trilogy, it is captivating on so many levels. Suzanne Collins is a wonderful writer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this book by recommendation from my best friend.  Could not put it down.  I was reading and all of a sudden \\"POW\\", something totally unexpected would happen.  It is rare that a book holds my attention and surprises me as did \\"Hopeless\\".  Kudos to Colleen Hoover.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like mystery and I'm not a great game player but this game is fun it's hard but not so hard that  I get discourage playing.<br />Mystery Manor fun game.  From Amazon.
034580404X|5.0|So many people see this book as a hot sexual book.  It is but it is so much more than that.  We have our male character that is just so perfect on the outside but &#34;fifty shades of ------ up&#34;. His relationship with our heroine Anastasia, her honesty, trust gives Christian the safety to deal with his demons and heal his inner child.  They have a wonderful love story filled with lots of hot sex.  I truly enjoyed it and also listened to all of the books on audio.<br />Many people compare these books to the Cross Fire books by Sylvia Day.  She jumped onto EL James success the stories are similar, even the names but in Day's books both characters have been sexually abused as children and there is just too much anxiety rather than &#34;heat&#34; produced while reading her books.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book. I can read it again and again. I recomend this book to anyone who likes reading.
B005898DDO|5.0|This is a great movie! Everyone should see this, if for no other reason, the history that is involved when you watch it.
B00422LESO|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. I simply couldn't put it down. The characters were relatable, but had just enough Austen flair to make it fun!
1455113549|5.0|Great Book.... Kept me interested the entire time. Passed along to my parents to listen to and told them to put it in right away. Reading of the book was very well done.
1579128149|5.0|I first saw this book at the library, but knew it was a book I wanted to own.<br />For a science lay person I find it the perfect blend; no shortcomings.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch novels. In general I have loved them all. Unfortunately this book is just a failed attempt at extending a great series with a mediocre plot and writing. I will always love the Harry Bosch series but this book just doesn't hang in with his previous work
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting, good story, depicting the rich and poor in England in the early 1900s.  Highly recommend this to you.
B007GP1CC2|5.0|The 17CD is totally worth the money.<br />I haven't finished listening to it.<br /><br />Some of the CDs is among the top ones.<br /><br />And I can hear a little white noise with my HD800. It does not bother me much. The noise may go away with other headphones.<br /><br />If you like Jacqueline Du Pre, buy this set.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Barely got through this one.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  New characters spurned no interest.  Old characters UN changing
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'm not one who would read these kind of books but after going through hell and high water with the man I love, I decided I wouldn't give up so easily. After reading this book, it made me realise that a man's way of communicating is so different from that of a woman's, as well as how one was brought up has an effect in it too. By reading, it has made me realise that what's said is not to hurt me but their way of pushing us to do better. It really does hurt sometimes. The book has brought a much deeper understanding in ways to communicate with ones spouse and not making them feel unappreciated. Some scenarios brought forward were like knocking on the doors to my arguments...hehe<br />All in all, I think it is a good counselling and communication therapy read. It makes you look and try to do better and helps you to put your best forward.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Probably one of the best album in the last 10-15 years... Each note is well crafted, planned and more than anything else opens a door for another perfect one... You do not want this album to end. If they can manage to carry this momentum into another album, I strongly believe that they can be the act of the century (carrying the flag of Radiohead).
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Not as easy as some might think.  Great matching game to keep older adults on their toes. Also fun for the family
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This TV series was just amazing.  Couldn't stop watching all 3 seasons . The finale of season 3 had us feeling so warm with the birth but totally shocked at the death.  I do hope they will continue with the series.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I watched the movie first and found many things to be different.  However, I still enjoyed the book and the story.  I would have liked them to day forward to their wedding and have seen Alex's reaction when she came back to be a family.  I know it's not original but still would have liked to see it.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|Twists, turns, science fiction all make a creative book. However, just too strange for me. I didn't hate hit but wouldn't suggest it either
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I like it because I can handle it easier that the book.. Easy on the eyes. Couldn't do better. Thanks
B008476HBM|5.0|a wonderful book recommend for all to read.  Old book and still a good one to read.  Wonderful read for all
1401322786|4.0|5 Stars for the great book, -1 star for the expensive price for such a thin book. Anyway, loved the book very much and I recommend it to kids, teens and also adults. :)
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this! I would have liked the fairy tale ending but life isn't a fairy tale. Writing done well, you root for almost every character
B0067EKY7M|4.0|Although a seemingly ridiculous basis for a movie, it was very real.  Good conversations, real relationships portrayed, and realistic outcomes.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I feel like the author picked a bunch of standard high schooler issues out of a hat and strung them all together to form a pretty convoluted piece of poo. It just screams &#34;I WAS PUBLISHED BY MTV!&#34; That and a teenage boy constantly bursting into tears was not only annoying but flat out unnerving. Was this a coming of age story? Maybe. But it's so far from realistic it's not funny.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved all 3 books in this series. Well written and an easy read. Find it hard to believe they were written for teenagers. Theme a little dark.
0812550706|5.0|Arrived on time and in excellent condition! I love this book...in high school I lost count of how many times I read it. Some of the sequels are a little dry, but this one is great. I also hear that it's coming out in theaters this year! Hope they do it justice!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show has a Robin Hood character plus great supporting stars-great looking women everything a 70 plus guy would like.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Very cute kids movie, I found it very entertaining. It also comments on the relationship between parents and there children. Good family movie.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Really good series read the whole series on a week I just couldn't put it down so if u like Percy jackson then you will love this definitely buy this book :-) :-) :-P
B00005JMCN|4.0|I read the book, and this is very much like the book! I'm sure there's differences between the real story and the book/movie, but if you read the book and want to see it on the little screen, this gets pretty close!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Not what I normally read but it kept my attention. A nice escape. It was easy for me to relate with the female lead.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great Show! It is different from the Graphic Novel which makes it much more suspenseful. If you like zombie thrillers this is a great show! Also I am in love with how I can just get the latest episodes with out having to worry about DVRing it through Amazon.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Movie was awesome. Playback was shaky. Video and sound would intermittently cut off. Actually would like a refund on my purchase... Update.... Amazon refunded my purchase no questions asked. They rock.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|i could not put it down.  an amazing story told by an amazimg story teller.  whether your first King book or your 10th its King at his best.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game has good visual quality and kind of teaches you how to take care of your own horse. this is a good game.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|The writers went concept on this and shows, big time. They wanted to draw the big picture, but, very, very few people go to Bond movies to \\"get\\" the big picture. they go for, realistic car chases, hot, hot women, incredible gadgetry, sadistic fight scenes, world ending scenarios and the ultimate victory of the british empire. In this movie you get prissy, prissy villains who kill as an afterthought, feeble characterization of entire cultures, (China), renovated standard characters, (Q)- were they trying to save money on him by doing the meetup in a museum? and post modern commentary of some solipsistic sort by pitting the bedrock of british intelligence against the frou frou villainry. Then they drop Albert Finney at the end, a man of the soil with a twelve gauge to indicate the indomitable nature of the british spirit. The movie may symbolically explain the zeitgeist of britain today, but, international audiences looking for the standard Bondian bang will miss, I think, the subtle social commentary for the long, tedious expositions of what it's like to be James Bond today.
B00571F26Y|4.0|My wife bought this to get thin fast.<br /><br />It remains in a pile of previously purchased weights and excercise equiptment.
0307744434|1.0|I had high expectations for this book but was severely disappointed.  I felt that the \\"main\\" characters were not developed enough and there were definitely things lacking.
B007SGM084|1.0|I am ashamed that I read it - it was gross - I did not read all of it - only about one fourth.<br /><br />I am 59 years old - maybe it is my age - but not for me.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Ethan Hawke must be so embarrassed.  I love movies, well, except this one.  The family is so annoying that I didn't care what happened to anyone.  I want my money back.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Tell the truth...I did not know what to expect when I got this book. I went on gut, I guess, and downloaded it. Boy, am I sure glad I did! To date, I have not finished it, but I know from what I have read, when the end comes, I am not going to be disappointed. The author is spot on making me feel I am with the character and experiencing the place and all the mundane and exceptionable situations he encounters...I like the Authors' style...Very entertaining, and that is what I want in a good book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Tender love story  didn't end like I thought. It ended better. As long as she lives Dawson will be with her
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Cleverly written, sweet little didddie about love! Or at trying to find it in Ireland. It is a story that wraps you up and takes you off to another place, where a quiet gal tries to find happiness.
B0084A9CA2|5.0|In the right frame of mind, this journey of personal progress is inspiring and a reminder that we too must take the steps along ours and not sit by and let it go by
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is one of those books that you read and never forget. I have read MANY, MANY, good books, but this one goes so far above and beyond the word \\"good\\" that I can't think of what else to call it. The writing was amazing, the characters are real people that you love and get angry with and understand and want to be a part of their  lives. This book got to me on so many levels for so many reasons. I loved that as the story line progressed and Sky began putting things together in her mind and memories that everything started to make sense in a way that it hadn't before. One big pet peeve of mine is when the plot line has holes in it. When something doesn't make sense or doesn't fit in with the reasons for it in the story. This book wrapped every little argument, vague comment, angry outburst, and dramatic event up in a way that it all fit together perfectly, made sense, AND best of all,... didn't give away the ending before you read it. I am VERY good at guessing the endings of books and picking up on all the clues in the story or the dialogue. (Trust me my husband hates it when we are watching a movie) I did not know what was going to happen at any point in this book. I will not give anything away for anyone who hasn't read it yet,... just please read it. You will not regret it!
1616550414|5.0|A must own for any Zelda fan.  Tons of info and history on locations and characters of the epic saga.  Great concept art and notes on characters and locations.  Just a really great read overall.
B009LRE040|5.0|I didn't care for this movie the first time around but after a second viewing I find it truly incredible.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One word AMAZINg it is so additive  to get off this game the best temple run yet 5 star game to me love it
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen's books you can picture her actually saying all these little things..She cracks me up.. Very funny in a sweet way.
067101756X|5.0|i have found the genre very absorbing over the years, and of course the people concerned are entitled to their various opinions.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My girlfriend really loves this show so it was a no-brainer as a great gift. I even watched the last half of the season and also enjoyed it.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This movie kept me engaged during the entire movie--which very few movies do for me. A must watch movie for sure.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing, just like the others. Ends in a cliffhanger that forces you to read the third one!!
B004TI5N38|2.0|I will buy a Reacher book any day. As long as it's written by Lee Child. I found myself resenting Puller and hating the author. What is missing is the creation of the mood, the brilliant twists and gradual crescendo when you are startled by the turn of events, and yet it all makes sense. At times, I found myself impressed that the author could so closely mimic Lee Child's work and seemingly keep a straight face. This story made no sense. It was pulled together in the end by creating a ridiculous and unbelievable plot hatched by buffoonish characters for little reason. Child's plots are also a stretch, but you grant him that room because of Reacher.<br /><br />I found myself wondering if Baldacci made a secret bet with Child that he could reproduce Child's work, because the similarities were not even slightly veiled. Even the name.. Pull versus Reach? Cmon! The diner, the run-down motel, the weird town-folk, refusal of a promotion, physical attributes....well I could go on but we all know that this was literary trickery. I will never buy a book from this author again.
B008MM9630|4.0|It's a nicely timed game that allows you t o succeed alone without help from others... I enjoy it for my free time
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun great game to know how to take care of a horse!<br />I'm in love with it.!!!!<br />(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book! I am not a big reader, but have gotten into reading because of the kindle on iPad....love reading on the kindle! This book was an easy read, with enough twists to it to keep me coming back. I must say the end did surprise me.

B004A8ZWW4|4.0|GREAT MOVIE<br /><br />I pretty much love anything with Hugh Jackman (EYE CANDY) but this one especially touched me.  Wonderful and entertaining!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I don't normally read what I affectionately refer to as &#34;light reading&#34;, but this book has converted me. I found it sweet, funny and with a nice twist at the end.  Without giving anything away, I did skip some of the sad portions, but that didn't interfere with the plot line. Try it, I think you'll like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book it was a romantic ride but will there be more Katniss and Peeta<br /><br />I love Pests he is sweet
B000I0QL82|5.0|This has always been one of my favorites!  The Dancing, singing costumes!!!  WOW MAGICAL!<br /><br />I completely recomend this to someone who, in any season, is feeling down to pick up the spirits!!!
B00A757EFW|3.0|So this isn't the touchscreen option I thought it would be, you actually touch a joystick and move it left to right or up and down which sounds cool but feels strange. I've only played a few times though, maybe you get used to it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|i am having a great time! the animals are fun to catch and upkeep is easy! i am happy with this game.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Too much violence.  No empathy for characters.  Pathetic plot,  not believable,just plain silly and not worth killing so many people.
B000002549|5.0|I bought this and loved it so much I bought another for my Mom and sisters. If you love classical and love Streisand you're in for a treat. If you are intimated by Classical music this is a great introduction to how accesible it can be.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is like a never ending flow of &#34;28 Days Later&#34; meets &#34;Red Dawn&#34;.  I am junkie.  Everytime I get access to a new season it effects my ability to function day to day.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|This book got so much critical acclaim, perhaps I just expected too much. I found it meandering and somewhat &#34;empty&#34; for want of a better word. Cleary, Mr. Ford is a very gifted writer, some of his character sketches are really evocative and yet the book gets bogged down in a story that lacks structure. The ending redeems the story substantially but with so many great works out there to read, this just wasn't worth my time.
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|I am a believer that noncognitive skills can help shape a child's success.  This book touches on many of the skills.  It is a nice introduction to the subject and offers some insightful character traits to help a child build a set of noncognitive skills.  I felt the book rather abruptly ended and did so on sour note.
B0074JODP8|5.0|This guy can flat play and sing the Blues.  Good ideas for songs and excellent photography !!!  I would have liked to get a better look at his pedal board.<br /><br />I loved it !!!!
B00005A1PR|4.0|India Arie, has a beautiful voice that does not get enough credit in the music industry.  It seems you have to take off your clothes now days to do that but then what you don't hear on the radio is usually the best talent.  She is very gifted in what she does musically.  You will not be disappointed.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|We enjoyed this movie greatly.  William H. Macy's character will bring a smile to your face.  What a likeable personality!  Helen Hunt's nude scenes are done tastefully.  John Hawkes and Helen Hunt's characters are totally believable and likeable.  An unusual and potentially depressing subject matter presented positively yet realistically.  Be sure and see this interesting story.  It will hold your attention and make you laugh too!
B0001AUAU4|5.0|Those who are into high end audio like myself and like to hear the deep details of even the back ground in the recordings, this is an artist to get.  Very light yet strong vocals.
0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins has created such wonderful realistic & enchanting characters, I could not put this story down. Now it's no secret that Romance books rarely have a surprise ending; main character usually female will get the Nice/Right partner in the end, usually a boy. But what I love about Miss Perkins is that these are characters I can relate to & wish I was friends with, so regardless if I know what will happen, I still love seeing it unfold, like listening to your friend's best stories. Even if it means I end up weeping in my car through the last ten chapters. Also I think that while the story is not that unique, the characters are super unique & refreshing to read about. Lola's fathers are gay & Lola is not a virgin but neither of these subjects are treated with any kind of drama or moral nagging, sex in general is more a sidenote in Perkins' stories, it's like real life, it just happens but that has nothing to do with falling in love or getting your heart broken which is the real meat of the story & why I keep turning pages.<br />My only complaints are I wish the cover model for Lola didn't look like a dead eyed cyborg, the model for Cricket looks almost spot on, could have had bigger wilder hair, but even the houses in the background match the story but &#34;lola&#34; just looks like plastic & dull & the outfit does not seem nearly as costumey as it could be...but thank god the writing didn't disappoint.<br />Oh and the last thing, I was so engrossed in this story that it even took over my dreams one night, in particular being in college with Cricket:p
B001NESPHC|5.0|I'm so happy I got this album.  Her voice is so unique, those tones you can just listen to all day and still want more.  Growing up listing to Black Gospel music I have always had a respect for singers who do their own thing.  Melody is one of those few, like Eva Cassidy, Mary Black and Jill Scott.
1594744769|4.0|this thankfully was not as scary as it looked, more like a coming of age story with a bit of a supernatural setting. it was a very easy fun read with such a wonderful clever use of real life photographs to create fictional characters. also the story felt unique, making use of real life historical moments as a backdrop to fantasy without there being big symbolic conspiracy theories unfolding, just more about subtle details to ground you a in the story while focusing on character development.<br />my only wish is that there wasn't such a cliffhanger ending, I think the book could have been easily twice the size & had a more a satisfying denoumount.
1936041847|2.0|I give it two stars because it's Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, which by itself is a five-star book. But I have to say that this translation is truly abysmal and riddled with intentional archaisms, I can never understand why translators used to want to do this with Greek & Latin texts. The Greek in which Marcus Aurelius wrote was not archaic in his time, so why are we making the translation archaic, and so formidably unreadable?<br />To this, add the fact that the text features misused words, misspelled words, words that don't exist, missing words that should be there but aren't, and (what I surmise is) Greek characters that the printer did not recognize, with the result that some words come across as gibberish with Roman characters but not recognizable as either Greek or English.<br />Maxwell Staniforth's dynamite translation of 1964 blows this one out of the water, and there are more recent translations still that I have not read all the way through, but which are much more reader-friendly. For that matter, Marcus' original Greek is much easier to read than this translation. I don't understand all the 5-star reviews praising the legibility of this translation. I find it absurdly bad, and I teach this book regularly in university philosophy courses.
0142419400|5.0|i so fell in love with this story, very realistic & sweet, i especially enjoyed the fact that Anna's father is a this douche nicholas sparks knockoff, finally someone pointing out how obnoxious those books are. while at the same time showing that a story can be emotional & romantic without being drenched in soap opera drama. plus anna is a smart independent girl that can fall in love without turning into a vapid flake suddenly obsessed with becoming a vampire. don't get wrong anna still makes mistakes & is a bit whiney but what teen girl isn't at some point, yet she is still capable of rational thoughts while still falling in love with possibly the wrong guy and the best part is that the story is set in paris so one can't help but find something sweet.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I love musicals and this movie has been one of my favorites!  If you love Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, and Carol Channing, this is a must for anyone!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|my husband and i are sorry we don't have Showtime, so this is the next best experience of fabulous drama
B006G2NVCA|5.0|If you liked the Tat, the dental floss and the Van Gogh, then you'll have a great time with this three CD set.  This is a great track for a rainy night on Lake Union.  Go for it &#34;coasters&#34;.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds is hilarious.  It is an easy game to play and can be challenging.  My entire family likes to play this game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.  I thought the beginning was a little slow and confusing and it took awhile to get hooked. As the literal plot thickened it was hard to put down.  The end of the novel as it continued I found more than one thing implausible.  The ending without giving out details was anticlimactic.  I would definitely suggest reading this novel because I found the premise and plot interesting.
B005HSL626|4.0|What can I say.  If you want a mindless challenging game this is the one.  Who doesn't like to slice and slash fruit.  My grandson loves this game.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I remember always loving this movie. But now watching it with adult eyes and finding out that the film was artistically designed by my favorite fantasy artist, Brian Froud, it was a whole new and even more amazing experience. I highly recommend the movie in general plus the special features on the Blu-ray Disc are fantastic!
B0059XTUXQ|2.0|A surprisingly short film, given the remarkable life of Ms. Thatcher.<br />Subtract, further, huge chunks in which a challenged elderly woman<br />dodders about her empty house, and there isn't much history to see.<br />(Streep does it beautifully...but oh, what MT's life story COULD've been!)<br />So this would've been 3 stars, except for the horrible, horrible<br />\\"extras.\\" I usually check Hi-Def Digest, when trying to decide if a blu-ray<br />is worth buying, over an upscaled DVD, but I didn't this time, figuring<br />that a blu-ray package about such a historical figure would surely include<br />some interesting stuff. Wrong. One decent 12 minute \\"Making of...\\" not bad,<br />but not much. Then, inexcusably, embarrassingly short \\"featurettes\\" that<br />are worse than worthless, because they 90% re-run pieces of the Making of!<br />Horrible time wasters. So there's 3 discs for 1 short movie and almost no<br />bonus stuff (not even a director's commentary!). Streep-a-holics only!
1451695195|3.0|Rating is because I was expecting something different.  It read along pretty well.  I thought he had a ratgher stilted way of expressing his experiences.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|Who would have thought that doodling with this little app could be so much fun?  Enjoyable.  It would be great for any age child or the child in the adult.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|hot stuff.  nice dancing.  tap dancing.  folk dancing.  square dancing.  disco dancing.  mostly just good clean american teenage fun.  yay!
1451620829|5.0|Peter Criss has written a tale of excess and, hopefully, redemption. Detailing some weird stories from his upbring, his years of abuse with and after KISS and, ultimately, his finding peace in life, Peter Criss pulls no punches. I thought this was one of the best rock books I've read in a long time even if Criss comes off as a jerk once in a while.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Enjoyed the story and the movie, love the fact that I could rent on Amazon well before any other channel - and very soon after the film was in theaters
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|An amazing story including problems that every IT professional has encountered in their careers. It's incredible how its brought focus to my daily work. ..I see at least one of the characters in the book every day.  The author has captured all of the classic IT issues in a single story. ..I started reading this as an assignment and couldn't put it down.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|It's fundamentally very easy to see ourselves as &#34;the best programmers&#34; in the world, just like the book implies we all drive better than anyone else, and we all get entangled in the power of that feeling of having accomplished multiple projects (or not) and we reach a comfortable stage in which we all believe we can't get better, and we're just the best that there's out there, simply missing the opportunities other great coders have had.<br /><br />But then, one day, you realize you really don't care. You don't care that there's somebody better than you (you start admitting that there is), and you start off with a new goal: &#34;to be as good as you can possibly be&#34;, and then you begin a new journey in which you only care about improving, about being better, about making a difference every day in every little piece of work you make.<br /><br />Once you reach this state, this book's going to be the Holy Bible for you. Otherwise, you might dismiss its teachings as &#34;not good enough for me&#34;.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I am a huge fan of this show and this season didn't disappoint.  I love the fact that I can watch the current episodes, and I own them as they come out.<br /><br />The only problem I had was the playback on a few episodes.  Not sure if Amazon was having a problem or if it was a problem with the quality of the film.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Awesome voice, great beat, passionate delivery. Emeli has a very distinctive voice and style. She easily recognizable and unique. Love it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always been interested in NDEs.  This book is the most unique version out there and it brings a lot of credibility to them.  I highly recommend it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is an excellent account of the hero's from both sides of the World War 2 conflict! Very well researched & written! An epic account of two very brave pilots; one American & one German & their unusual encounter! The reader will find that there were both 'great & lesser men' representing all of the combatants in this horrific war started by a mad-man! This is one great book that was very hard to put down from beginning to end!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book just flowed, easy to read. Made me eager to get to the last page. The ending was truly unexpected.
B005LAII62|5.0|Super movie eeven the kids enjoy it.<br />It was new<br />CAme on time<br />And everyone is asking me were I got it.<br />Thanks really enjoying it..8)
B0031RS4V6|4.0|I really enjoy the way this author writes and describes his detail. Jack Reacher is so cool and whatever he does just seem to work out.
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|Just enjoyed watching and being entertained for awhile.  After all isn't that the prime reason for watching movies. To sit back for a couple of hours relax and enjoy!  I understand that not all movies have that objective but, darn it's nice to just sit back and watch, enjoy, and escape for a little while! thanks!
B009G41CG2|5.0|Great brain work out!  Kids to seniors can enjoy this game.Great way to pass time in waiting rooms, airports, etc...
B002I9Z8CG|5.0|I've been a viewer of all the Star Trek programs and movies.  I  particularly enjoyed this movie in blu-ray and because of the content.  Where else is a person ever going to see all the  characters together again!  Plus I thought the movie was just a good watch.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|Love it! On loop for the last six months. Sounds great live too. Did not realize how much I missed new music from this band until I got this one.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|The thief you alternately root for and want to 'fix'.  Great characters.<br />HEY WHEN WILL SEASON 4 BE AVAILABLE ON DVD/BLU RAY?????
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Reminds me of some of Grisham's earlier books.  Not quite as good but better than the last few he's written.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and unraveling the disturbed girl in the story.  I've found myself a new favorite author.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What can I say, I bought Wool looking for a new series of books to bury myself in, and I got what I paid for and some. From the first story I was captivated by the world of the silo, the way so many humans lived and interacted for so long in such a confined space. I cannot recommend these books enough.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|How could u not give this 5 stars i mean come on. the music fits the tone of the game perfectly and when your fighting in the boss battles theirs another side of you that comes out everytime the music hits. My favorite song would be The Strains Of Time
B009FZFONO|5.0|it's like a really well-written, acted, shot, zed movie that keeps getting better as the story progresses.  love it. lots

B004XZR63M|5.0|I purchased more book from rich dad poor dad and I jus keep reading day and night I am reading investment book now
B00BETX5PS|2.0|There seemed to be bluish tinge on whole of the movie.The quality of picture was not good. The was no sharpness<br />as HD should have. I use Netflex too  and they seem to have a much better resolution for HD movies.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I have started after finishing the book put the thing I learn in book to work for me and my life
0316019984|5.0|Any kid (young or old) who loves Super Heros will love this book.  What a find.  It is the most intricate pop up book I've ever seen.<br />My godson loved it!
B003SHUMRI|5.0|I guess I was a little behind the times in not seeing this until recently (2013) but I loved it.  I wasn't expecting much of a story line, just a dance movie (which I enjoy) and surprised to find both!  This is one I would definitely watch again!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|A solid Bond movie with some nice twists and great action scenes. Would have been nice to have a more \\"unique\\" villain but otherwise worth the time commitment to watch.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I really like the Soundfly Transmitter! It does exactly what it stated and I watched a youtube video before buying so I was already familiar with how to use it. I absolutely love the remote control, it makes changing songs a breeze!<br /><br />Great job again Amazon with the packaging!!!!
0399160450|5.0|Bought for my husband.  He reads whatever<br />Tom Clancy writes.  I will always pre order<br />his book for my husband.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I totally loved this book I can't wait to read the 2nd and 3rd! It was action packed and full of awesomeness!
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I need major help in trying to get this app to work. I have big hopes for it but no time to spend studying how to get it to be valuable to me.
B00684J49U|5.0|If you're not a Grey's fan, then you really should catch up. I needed Season 8 for my collection. No complaints
0385535147|4.0|Great story with action and twists, that I can't put the book down until I read the very last<br />line.  A fun and enjoyable reading experience.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Works well on my Kindle Fire. I like that I have the options to either have just the nature sounds or just the music or both. I also like that each sound has its own volume which can be adjusted. As its set up now it closes automatically when you go to home screen and I really wish that there an option so it would stay on while I'm using other apps.  Great App otherwise when I'm not using my Kindle for other things.
B002WBZD02|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I had seen &#34;Be Cool&#34; (the sort of sequel) YEARS ago but never saw this until I found it here for my Kindle.  Glad I &#34;rented&#34; it.  My boyfriend and i enjoyed it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|you really need to try this game. I never get tired of playing it and always feel challenged by each game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|easy to purchase and fun to watch - a few difficulties with the feed but overall its great! I recommend it
B0000508UN|4.0|my husand was asking me about this one song, time to rememeber. and i am glad i found it at amazon
B0000AQS0F|4.0|After watching a re-run episode on TV, found series to be well produced.  Finding all episodes on one bundle was a great find.
B005R32L66|5.0|I have used this on my computer for a few months and love the process that this uses.  I hope you keep it up.
B002OSXDAU|3.0|I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be done with it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|A must need for any smart phone that you use for class.  I love this app and hope you keep up the great work.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be done with it.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be done with it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game rocks it is so easy on the screen but not in real life. It is hard not to hit any of those bombs.:)
B0049P1N3K|4.0|I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be done with it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have always been a great fan of Ken Follett and I love this book, I like the era it covers. Looking forward to reading Book Two. It was the second book I read on the Kindle and it made me appreciate the Kindle more as the book was rather large to read in bed and carry around.
B0086700CM|3.0|After hearing a LOT of hype about this game, I decided I had to try it. Unfortunately for me, I just don't see the fascination with it. The endless running gets monotonous. But my son loves it! I guess I learned that these &#34;running&#34; type of games just aren't my style.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Bossypants and Howie Weener Unclogged are the two funniest books I've read this year.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  [...]  Nothing like great big laughs!
B0096PYUE2|5.0|I tried to download Adobe Flash yesterday to watch live stream,but it didn't seem to be working.  So, I researched and followed the instructions; and it now appears to be working.  Here are the instructions:  (1) Go to any web page.  (2) Touch the icon at the bottom of the screen with three bars on it.  (3) Touch \\"Settings.\\" (4) Scroll down to Enable Flash and select \\"always on.\\"  That's all there is to it!  (You might have to download Adobe Flash first, as I did yesterday.)
B008IGP8RI|4.0|I saw \\"Lawless\\" in the theatre last year and really liked that movie a lot. Never bothered to pick up the soundtrack, until now.<br /><br />\\"Lawless: Original Soundtrack\\" (14 tracks; 42 min.) has Nick Cave's fingers all over it (he was credited as both the movie's co-writer and of course the music scorer, the latter along with Warren Ellis, of the \\"Bad Seeds\\"). \\"The Bootleggers\\" (the movie's houseband) starts off strong with \\"Fire and Brimstone\\" and \\"Burnin' Hell\\" before giving way to an amazing a cappella \\"Sure 'Nuff 'N Yes I Do\\" by the legendary Ralph Stanley. Then we get into the middle section in which the equally lengendary by now Emmylou Harris is featured (as the lead or co-lead vocalist) in 5 of the next songs, to great effect. The one song in the middle she is not on is a hilarious \\"White Light/White Heat\\" cover by the Bootleggers. That same song is again covered, completely differently but equally great, by Ralph Stanley, who later on also brings another version of the earlier \\"Fire and Brimstone\\". Nick Cave and Warren Ellis close things out with a nice \\"End Crawl\\" instrumental. After that, there is a 'bonus' track from Willie Nelson (\\"Midnight Run\\"), why, I don't know.<br /><br />In all, this is a great collection of Americana music. Comparisons have been made with the \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" soundtrack, and in particular, why that one became a supersmash hit, and \\"Lawless\\" has not. Who knows? and who cares? The music business is fickle and success is never predicatble. It doesn't take away from the enjoyment of this soundtrack. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|My daughter downloaded this game and really loves it and says it is really fun. Four stars given because some things require too many &#34;hearts&#34; to get new things, but still recommend this game
B0007SM922|4.0|I went to college in the 70's and Savoy Brown with Kim Simmons was one of the great British blues bands touring America at that time.  We used to get really high and go see them so, yeah this album brings back a lot of great memories... sort of...
B0044C5SCU|5.0|We were sad to see it go after 5 years but glad we can watch online. We started watching mid third season and recently decided to watch the entire series from season 1 to the end.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I found this case to be a well made, sturdy, reliable case for not only a kindle Fire, but for any tablet/e-reader in the same size range.  I like that it looks like a book and people may think it's one (and walk past it rather than steal it.)  Even though it started out with an odor it disipated after a while.  Well worth the investment.
B000003CMB|5.0|Love the whole sound so tight and out of sight.<br />Need more bands like them just wish i was there to see them live.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|This book was great to read, and had some interesting ideas, but the gist of the book is: success is more about the circumstances surrounding a person than the actual qualities of that person. The author sets it up nicely but in the end, it kind of feels like: &#34;Duh!&#34;
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I not real impressed with this game, if you want to call it that.  It is very hard to figure out what to do.  I will be deleting it next time I pick up my Kindle Fire.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is a lot of fun especially if you like super Mario brothers. The whole family can enjoy it too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great, great game, it gets the brain working.  My granddaughter and I play side by side to see who gets done first!
B00992CF6W|5.0|A great game for anyone for anywhere. The best game that anyone could crate and it is portable. very very fun.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi Picoult tackles a difficult subject with knowledge and sensitivity. It will keep you turning pages and enlarge your sympathy for families and teens dealing with this life we all share.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love your game. I mean it goes the rite speed but they should make all the charactors free cause your wasting all your coins on stupid stuff.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Anyone that loves puzzles would love this game. I`t very challenging but fun.Try to beat your own time. Or try to challenge the second puzzle. I am addicted.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|I will watch this movie over & over again.  Jennifer Beal was one great dancer and made the movie believable. It doesn't hurt that she's cute too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read the first Hunger Games book you have to read them all.  Great books!  Always keeps you guessing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've been watching walking dead from the beginning...The season and episode  just gets better and better..... season 3 picture quality is great...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the entire trilogy -- everyone should read this and even young teens as it is clean but exciting.  Get it.
0800187881|5.0|Normal romance. They fall in love! Oh wait there is the story in between! Two brainiacs figure out that it is not just about sex. It is about caring and appreciating one another. The story to get to this part will make you go AWW! So buy it! Get it! Go to the bathroom first because once it starts you won't want to get off that seat. It is a sappy, whimsical, loving and FUNNY movie. Enjoy the transformation B. S. makes!
0345803485|5.0|I heard all the commotion about the book so u decided to purchase a used version on Amazon. I read it, loved it + also loved how my used book was in perfect condition.
B001TH8UUA|3.0|I don't know what is wrong with this cable, even the generic HDMI cable that came with my apple TV puts out better picture quality than this one.  It works, just not getting any HD.. haha, please change the name to ANALOG-MI
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Better than any American made movie I've seen in years.  Well worth entertainment dollars.  Beautiful costumes, scenery and story. Can't wait for Season IV.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|I was only 10 years old when this album came out but a few years later I discovered it and I keep coming back to it. Love Pearl Jam. Love Ten.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I don't think there are enough words to describe this book... writing us absolutely amazing..the story of 2 people with such terrible pasts can make it through...I'm on the edge of my seat ,qweezy stomach waiting for the next book!! This is a must read!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This serious I have been reading for a while so it was definitely  a good third book I love the beginning and end of the story which kept me reading
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Although it does play a bit loose and fast with some of the facts, &#34;Argo&#34; remains an entertaining drama about a real event that occurred in 1980.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Set in 1980, five members of the U.S. Embassy are trapped in post-revolution Iran hiding in the Canadian Embassy, the Canadian government and the CIA must figure out a plan to retrieve them safety. A CIA agent (Ben Affleck who also directed) proposes the absurd--he will go in pretending to be a film producer for a science fiction movie and the group will leave the country as part of his film team.<br /><br />Those bothered by historical inaccuracies in a dramatic film BASED on real events may dislike the fact that 1) the sequence in the bazaar never happened (it does add nicely to the suspense and Affleck admits as such in his commentary track), the entire conclusion in the airport never happened (again, Affleck in the director's commentary admits he was trying to increase the suspense)and that the Canadians aren't recognized enough for their efforts in assisting the Americans to escape (Affleck added a postscript recognizing them but admits in the commentary track that he had to simplify the plotline a bit to make it work within the proscripted time limit for the film).<br /><br />If you can look at this as a dramatic event based on a real one and accept that it doesn't adhere to history 100%, you will enjoy the film.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />&#34;Argo&#34; is, in many respects, a throwback to earlier style thrillers. Affleck chose to eschew the ADD rapid cutting and shakey cam of contemporary thrillers echoing the style of a thriller from the time the film is set in.<br /><br />The grainy and somewhat harsh look of the film is intentional--Affleck deliberately mimicked the look of late 70's/early 80's thrillers right down to the lighting of the film. Detail is exceptionally good and there aren't any noticeable digital artifacts in the presentation. Colors are rock solid throughout. &#34;Argo&#34; receives a sharp, detailed and strong presentation on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The audio is exceptional as well with an active 5.1 mix although keep in mind that much of the film is dialogue driven.<br /><br />The special features are quite nice as well with a commentary track from star/director Affleck and writer Chris Terrio that provides us with quite a bit of detail on the shoot as well as some changes that occurred during the scripting vs. shooting of the film.<br /><br />We also get a picture-in-picture option that allows you to watch interviews with those who lived through the incident discuss as we're watching the action. It's a terrific special feature.<br /><br />We also get a very good featurette featuring the people who lived through the events portrayed in &#34;Argo&#34; including former President Jimmy Carter.<br /><br />&#34;Absolute Authenticy&#34; focuses on how detailed the production was at recreating the look of the time.<br /><br />&#34;Escape from Iran-The Hollywood Option&#34; is the only special feature presented in standard definition running about 48 minutes. It features plenty of interviews and vintage footage that contrasts nicely with the ficitional account.<br /><br />Although the film has been criticized for its lack of fidelity to the facts, the fictionalized version of what occurred in 1979 is a terrific thriller that nicely recaptures the feel of the time.<br /><br />Recommended.id throughout. &#34;Argo&#34; receives a sharp, detailed and strong presentation on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The audio is exceptional as well with an active 5.1 mix although keep in mind that much of the film is dialogue driven.<br /><br />The special features are quite nice as well with a commentary track from star/director Affleck and writer Chris Terrio that provides us with quite a bit of detail on the shoot as well as some changes that occurred during the scripting vs. shooting of the film.<br /><br />We also get a picture-in-picture option that allows you to watch interviews with those who lived through the incident discuss as we're watching the action.

B005EM8O8O|5.0|Great premise. Fast read...well crafted. Tale feeds off of the insanity brought to all of us by investors who believed more in the algorithms physicists created to spread risk than common sense.  They created an inverted pyramid of trillions of dollars of bets backed by only billions in assets that were at best dubious.  Hubris and greed without end.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|I love this game, it's so easy to play and the best part is that the fish moves like a real fish in water, at least that's the illusion. I also like that this is a relaxing game, and the music adds to that feeling. I wish you could make subtle color changes; I wouldn't want bright color and details, but muted color changes would be cool.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was little gory with referring to her abusive husband, but otherwise wonderful reading!<br />Keep up the good work and romance.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Great actors, wonderful production great story. Very funny. Loved this movie from the beginning to the end.  Wes Craven has had some trouble putting his whole view togwther,  in this production the story is simple which helps add to the character development.  There is a reason a list actors signed up for this project.
B003YV0A02|4.0|Great movie to watch with my dad who watched it when he was my age. Working our way through the die hards. This one was a good one to watch.
B007TMON8M|1.0|In the central US, WiFi is not ubiquitous.  As such, if you're standing in line someplace, with a WiFi only tablet or media player, and want something to pass the time, this game won't work for you.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Like the calming background sounds.....It is great for concentration building. Challenging and non repetitive with a variety of different puzzles.
B008NABUU8|1.0|I was waiting in line and looking for something to pass the time, so I decided to check out this game that I'd installed as a Free App of the Day but never used yet.  I was unable to use this app because there was no WiFi access at that location.<br /><br />My Android devices are WiFi only, so I do not have access to the net in establishments that don't offer WiFi.  WiFi is NOT ubiquitous in the central US, so I got a message that the game requires the internet to play and it exited.<br /><br />If I'm at home, I have other devices for gaming and don't bother picking up my Android units.  As such, this game is worthless to me in the places where my Android devices see use, since they aren't able to connect if WiFi isn't available.
B00BESNKB8|3.0|Seems like it's the kind of movie where the better known actors have nothing better to do at the time. It definately seem that the whole movie was made just to try and make &#34;RZA&#34; into a bigger star, butt &#34;HE SUCKS as an actor!!!&#34; they made him the main character, and tried to make him the main Bad ass butt they failed greatly! I think Lucy Liu could've kicked his butt for real.
B001O4XWJM|4.0|Enjoyed the movie - average western.<br /><br />God Bless America!<br />God Bless America!<br />God Bless America!<br />God Bless America!<br />God Bless America!
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This book completes the trilogy in a surprising and very good<br />way. I still heartily recommend the series to all who enjoy science fiction at it's best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best app ever is my horse no question ever since I got my kindle I've had my horse  it's 10 stars out of 5 !!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If luv this as well as my younger bro he can do section 1 2 3  by himself he's only 5
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|When I got this book i just couldn't put it down had it read in 2 days. When I started it and put it down was a few hrs later. It pulled me right and I kept wanting more. I had to find out who done it. I loved how the women from the old folks nursing home new how to use ipads. And how they played a part in helping solve the murder. I would say this is a lite chick read by the pool book that you don't have to think to hard to read. I would of paid for it but got it free. Still I have to say was a great story. Kept my intrest.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|Best greatest hits CD (in my opinion). I grew up with my dad playing elvis s it brings back some great childhood memories. I can't think of a sing that is missing!
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I can't believe how well this dvd was packaged not one dvd was messed up. Great show. Just love how all the actors get along on the show. Was a great price to for me to deside to get this dvd. It was a birthday present for me cause i'm a die hard fan of the show. I just missed the first season and wanted to see how it all got started. So I got this dvd.
B004LROMX4|2.0|[[ASIN:B004LROMWU Falling Skies: The Complete First Season]]The advanced nort american technology falls, and a bunch of rednecks with rifles have  success!!! Jesus.....oh...it's just for fun....!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|excellent, series is the best I have seen.  My girlfriend and I can't wait for the next episode.  We are inspired by the great acting and story.
0810989956|4.0|My stepson has enjoyed putting together his own little diary.  He is learning to read, and these books have been wonderful for him!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Its fun for me, my 10 year old son and 7 year old daughter! I provides hours of entertainment, especially in the car.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Special effects section was incredible.  I normally don't spend much time with these, but they were GREAT telling the story of this movie.<br /><br />As far as SKYFALL the video and audio were both excellent!  This is the Best &#34;Bond&#34; ever!!!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Great movie for kids. Good spirited and has enough &#34;scary&#34; things for them to feel interested, but not scary. My 7 year old daughter loves it.
B007NU54H4|5.0|This movie is absolutely the most amazing of the Disney Fairies ones (so far)! It was such a touching story and I wound up buying it for my older sister (we are both in our twenties), as it was just a so well-made and in-depth fairy tale! My sis and I are a bit like Tink and Periwinkle, it was just too much fun! It also came with a lenticular card fastened to the case, something I was not expecting to see but was very pleased with. Shipping was free with my account and arrived very quickly. A well-worth it purchase for a spectacular Disney movie (that should have been in theaters, in my opinion).
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I wish I could give this app 0 stars.  I've. Tried to download this app 4 times on my kindle fire and it won't completely download.  I give up.....so not worth the time wasted!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What more is there to say?  A classic movie.  Great to have all the extra features, especially the one including the interview of the director.  Jerks the tears every time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it alot because because you can collect coins and beat your friends high scored and you can buys different kine. Of board and people and when you play subway surfers you can play and when you play you can collect coins and get 2x and magnet that collects coins and its changes places last time it was new york and know it change to Rio and I like subway surfer and they should make subway surfer 2.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great brain teaser ......good way to pas the time.  me and my wife play it daily to pass time and challenge each other
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Always a pleasure to use, and it works like a charm.  There are those times when a tune is playing (in the mall or some other public venue), and Shazam easily identifies it.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Another good Tom Clancy read. The scenarios are believable and compelling. At times the character details can be repetitive but this doesn not detract from the overall quality of the read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me a few tissues in hand a couple of times . It's so inspiring and such  profound love for someone. It truly will make you love and appreciate your relationship family the whole nine years that much more. You must BUY THIS BOOK NOW.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Good entertainment but a little slow in parts. Denzel Washington has the charisma thing going on but seems like the same movie as other movies he's made ( typical D.W. movie) Still worth watching.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I was concerned after book 2 the pace would slow down in the middle of the book. I have never been so mistaken. I can't put this one down! Diana Gabaldon has delivered a timeless tale of intrigue, phenomenal character development, and historical/present juxtaposition.<br />I love Voyager and I look forward to the rest of the series!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game and the first one is good game to and me and my friends play it a lot I hope they come out with a temple run 3
B00B6DTWM2|1.0|Really bad - I don't know how this movie received 3,4 & 5 stars.  Don't waste you money on it.
0800177363|5.0|Robin williams before he was too popular.  Robert Deniro.  Max Von Sidow.  The Jewish lady.  All do a great job of portraying the pathos of the success and failure of a wonder drug as we experienced it in 1970
1619691884|5.0|This book is for anyone who knows someone who has had cancer as Hitchens approaches the subject with a clarity that I have never read before. Absolutely priceless.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a very strange book. I was automatically drawn in by the concept of the book. \\"Wife vanishes on anniversary! Was it the husband? If it wasn't the husband, then where is Amy!\\"<br />I loved the set up of the book, bouncing between Nick in the present and Amy's diary entries. There was just enough twists in this book to keep me on edge, and at some points I was really stuck on what to believe. Just when I thought I had it figured out, The next chapter would drop a bombshell twist. The characters are so well developed, it really is believable.<br />The ending was very lacking though, which is why I only gave 4 stars. Gillian Flynn really thought out and developed each chapter, but the last section was very short and just a disappointment. I didn't like that the true crime went unpunished, and everyone just let it go. I think the ending has a lot of room for improvement.<br />Overall, I liked the book. It was an entertaining read.
B00000IREA|3.0|Still a classic.  Won't watch it as much as we thought.  Wish I had watched it on cable before buying it.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Don't start this unless you have lots of time. It's hard to stop!  And don't tell your boss you have it on your phone or he'll know you are playing at work.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|What a great story brought to life.  Nice body!  I love the brightness and lack of graphic violence.  Great romance.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Compared to other books by Albom, The Time Keeper was disappointing. I could not put down Albom's previous books, as they were very engaging and inspiring in the message. This wasn't the case for me with The Time Keeper. I ended up reading the entire book to give it a fair chance, and I eventually got into the ending. Towards the end, I found the book to be inspiring. All in all, this book was not up to Albom's standards.
0743289692|5.0|Another amazing story.  Again, Americans don't have a clue.  They think everyone in the world should respect women because we do.  But it isn't that way.  Anyone who wants to see how the Muslum world treats women should read this book.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've read them all and love this series.  They seem to get better and better.  Now, I'm waiting for the next book.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I read this when I was young and it's just wonderful to be able to share this book with my son.  He really loves it and makes me read it all the time.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|Fast moving and easy read.  Could picture Castle and Beckett as Rook and Heat.  Stayed on the edge of my seat!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's fun, but graphics could be better, it could just be how they want it I am cool with that. It is very fun, especially when your able to build Tue most creative things. I like how there are lots of land forms and mountains and beaches. Very fun, and  I do like the multiplayer mode really fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Of the several weather apps I have tried so far on my Kindle Fire HD Accu Weather's is so far number one. Navagation is easy, the longe range forecast along with the radar and maps are so very helpful.....and it all is pleasing to the eyes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing!! The series is addicting and my husband and I love it, excited to see how the season plays out and what's in store for season 4.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I am finding The Free Dictionary Pro to be very helpful. I am an editorial cartoonist and correct spelling is a must. What I also like is th word of the day and the Thesaurus. It's worth the couple of dollars to have it ad free. Highly recommended
B009YP9L7U|3.0|(3 1/2 stars really). What every single girl is thinking when they see that hot, rich guy in the casino.  The writing was slow to start, but after a few chapters it picks up nicely and moves quickly.  Megan and Connor are believable characters with relationship flaws brought upon them from their less than ideal upbringings.  They go through the ups and downs of a new marriage while having to discover themselves along the way.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I really like to play this alone, or with other people.  It's easier to play on long car rides and things than a real chess board.  Also l enjoy how you can choose your difficulty.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love this series and this season is a true heart wrencher. The extras on this were worth watching. Very important season for Downton fans.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This show is well done from the writing, the costumes, the sets, and the acting.<br /><br />Every episode is like a fantastic journey into the life of the British elite.<br /><br />The show is enjoyable and I am still hooked on it!
B005IGDW24|4.0|And my son was one of the 3D stereo artists who converted the 2D movie to 3D. We enjoyed it.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book is awfully similar to another romance novel I read a few weeks before I read this one.<br /><br />It started out with some fun elements and the writing was decent. I was disappointed that it was not an original concept.
B006JSXYPA|4.0|My son spent about 9 months working on the team of 3D stereo artists making the conversion from 2D to 3D. I am not a true Transformers fan, but thoroughly enjoyed seeing this in 3D.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|There are so many season 3 haters out there. I still love the show even though there were major ups and downs this season. I think they feel much more intense because after watching the show for several seasons, I feel attached to some of the characters and plot lines. Reflecting on previous seasons, there were dramatic plot twists that seemed part of Downton so I guess the biggies on season 3 are still in tune with the other seasons.<br /><br />Overall, I am interested to see what will happen in season 4 so ultimately the show is still a success!
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I enjoyed this in the theaters in 2D, but enjoyed it even more at home in 3D. Worth buying. I recommend it.
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|Really enjoying this '70s feel. What really continues to catch me is the \\"authentic\\" sounds of the guitar and the rest of the band. One of my favorites of 2013!
B00884GR0W|1.0|All my friends kept raving about this game, but as for me I didn't enjoy it at all. It drained my battery extremely quickly and I really didn't see the point. *shrugs* but that is all in my own humble opinion
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|All I want to say is how amazing this movie is, and that is definitely worth the buy. I rented it on demand and as soon as it was over I got on here so I could get it on Blu-Ray and have it forever! Great Movie! Buy it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|could be more User friendly took me a while to figure out how to play. gets easier after the learning curve.
B008N1LL42|1.0|Worst Movie Ever<br /><br />You can NOT fast-forward fast enough!  Don't do it!  SAVE YOURSELF!<br /><br />Some bad movies are fun to watch 'cause they're bad:<br />Night of the Lepus, Plan 9 from Outerspace<br /><br />Some bad movies can be watched 'cause they're bizarre:<br />Zardoz, Galaxy of Terror (ok, it has alien / girl action going for it too)<br /><br />Some are (somewhat) entertaining even if bad:<br />Most action movies, movies with folks that are nice to look at or watch act even if the rest is dreadful.<br /><br />This movie is just BAD.<br />No acting worth watching (I didn't know Liam could be that wooden).  The \\"beautiful girlfriend\\" reminded me of a Barbie doll (not in a good way).  The \\"hero\\" was something I'd clean off my shoes.  Special effects, not much.  Plot was weaker than the rest of it.<br /><br />The only thing in the whole movie worth looking at was the \\"sailor\\" played by the singer gal...  And that's only cause I like gals with miniguns.<br /><br />Oh, for those who claim it makes the Navy look good (\\"an advertisement\\"):  I was in the Navy.  It just makes this movie worse.  More bad things to see.  I think, at 12 I would have thought:  \\"No way ship do that!\\" \\"No way Navy people do that!\\"  Now it just makes me want to throw up.  The crew of the worst ship, at the worst time in history, would still beat this bunch.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If they had made it a hard \\"R\\" rating with lack of clothes, blood and gore, etc:  It would still be a bad movie, but MIGHT redeem itself as BAD entertainment...  As is:  Worst
B004DF3S7A|5.0|A pleasure to listen to.  Stewart does a great job.  He stepped out of the rock and roll and into the old standards with ease.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Yes this was a good read .Different. Interesting. Keeps you guessing and that is always good ion a book because you MUST find out what happens. Yes I liked it and it is worth reading
B004SXKRQC|2.0|Wow, the writing and general story line are different and interesting. If these 90 minutes were some 30, even 60 minutes with SOMETHING else of interest/value as a subplot, etc. I would probably have like it. As it was I was left at the end of the movie feeling a general ...huh?  Is that all there is?  My wife feel asleep half way through, but I always said I married a smart woman.  I don't know how this survived a week of theater distribution ... but perhaps it only played in Art Houses with no general distribution.  I love these actors ..... only reason I continued to watch, and the reason I did not rate it one star.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love the game but you need to update it were u can go to the nether on creative like u know flint and steel
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I love this movie and was so excited to see it available for instant download.  Better yet it was free with my prime subscription!  The streaming quality was great and never once hiccuped during the movie.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Sylvester Stallone did an outstanding job with this movie. If you love 80's action movies, then you won't be disappointed with this one!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|what can i say i love the show and i watch it on tv when it comes on but then i bought the shows so i could watch them again and i have got a lot of friends on this show.......it to me is one of the best shows out!
B00B0ZT9NI|1.0|Although my Bluray device was on the approved list Amazon Prime would not work to stream movies therefore it downloaded to my Kindle...I will never watch a movie on my Kindle...terrible! I wasted my money and don't have any use for your Prime streamed movies since they won't work with my device... Very disappointed.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Decent game and graphics but this is only a demo version. The game price also went up. Overall three rating cause they didn't mention it cost more money when I got the g5e sales event.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|This is a great book in my opinion, but they could have found a better way to end it all. I'd write Monte, but I'd don't want to spoil.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't remember the last tv series that I loved this much!  My entire family is hooked.  Every week is full of action, suspense, great story writing, excellent characters, and it leaves you hanging after every episode.  LOOOOVE IT!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hannah this book was the best ever!<br />I love this book more than any other book I ever red before!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What more can I say? If you like a subtle drama, this is definitely for you. There is so much happening in between the lines and it's just fantastic :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Ths is an excellent game for all of my family to sit around and relax and play. I'd recommend this game to any one.
B008XCF7Y6|5.0|Great movie loved how they included the people from the first. I hope they make another one. The graphics are video game like could be a little better
B005HSL626|5.0|I Love all of the games on Amazon. My boys and I truly have enjoyed them. Since I am a gardner, This was a very cute game for all of us to play. 10 star rating on this game also.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's always so sad when a good book is finished. Started slow but with all the new story lines and info kept me going. Perfect finish
B003YOZNBK|1.0|I had to dend the one tape back, but neither tape worked.  The return went quickly, but i would rather have had the tapes.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|The best Men In Black yet!! Loved it. Purchased the rental for my husbands birthday he loved it. Watched it twice. Will definitely purchase the movie!!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This is one of the better Star Trek series in that it shows early warp flight, and the potential problems that could be faced.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a fun seek and find mystery game that lasted quite awhile with 10 chapters. The plot was fun but graphics and creepy music/ sound effects were certainly a good addition.
1568363842|4.0|I like this book because its easy to use and it has Romaji so easy to read and study by myself.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I instantly bought this CD after hearing this band on SNL. Rock and Roll/bluesy kind of sound. Reminds me a bit of Janis Joplin. Great CD!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Better than &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34; but &#34;Casino Royale&#34; still best of Daniel Craig's Bond movies, so far. Not sure I like the new &#34;M&#34;. Not sure I like the _idea_ of a new &#34;M&#34; so &#34;soon&#34;, either. The new &#34;Q&#34;, however, is a brilliant choice.
B0015KO52S|5.0|During my years as a junior high and high school student, Jack White was a bad word to me. I spent much of my time then hearing people raving about The White Stripes and hearing all of their music all over the radio. None of it appealed to me. At all. I sat wondering why the band was so popular and never could figure it out. This reaction to that particular band and Jack White in general remained afterward.<br /><br />It wasn't until I saw the documentary film, '[[ASIN:B002RVZV9K It Might Get Loud]],' that I finally actually started paying attention to Jack White and what he really means to the music industry. Here I must apologize for talking so much about the man in a band of several different musicians. I know very well that The Raconteurs is a collective band that comprises of musicians who write music together. However, this mention of Jack White is very important to my reception of the album at hand.<br /><br />I was familiar with the song 'Steady As She Goes' somehow. I am still not sure where or how I heard it, but I did. It was not really an impressive song at all to me. I blew the song off without any thought. To this day I have the same feelings for the song. The whole of '[[ASIN:B001AP11KW Broken Boy Soldiers]],' in fact, is an album which I am still largely unimpressed by. However, it wasn't until one of my coworkers decided to put 'Consolers of the Lonely' on the loud speakers at work that I finally came to appreciate what this kind of music is capable of.<br /><br />'Consolers of the Lonely' has it all. In every way that 'Broken Boy Soldiers' fell short for me, this album exceeded. There is energy and power in this album unlike many other bands are even willing to attempt. The opening track alone provides a perfect feel to the record. Then throughout the rest of the album that same energy balances itself out with the proper amount of relaxed musicianship. Honestly I don't think I can really write a cohesive review of what I would like to mention. Whenever I try to think of something specific, my mind simply jumps to other things that stand out to me. I will just list them here now as best as I can:<br /><br />- For guitar lovers, this album is key. So many guitar tones... so many. And they are beautiful indeed.<br />- 'You Don't Understand Me' has one of the greatest piano solos I have ever heard. And it is a solo comprised of only one note. Yes, the greatest piano solo and it is comprised only of ONE note. Sometimes at different octaves. It's so good.<br />- The country-esque style that is included in some of the songs is superb. Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle. That's the key to these great tracks.<br />- There is some magnificent storytelling in some of these songs. From the lonely desert western 'Switch and the Spur' to the detailed family drama of 'Carolina Drama,' there are great stories to be heard.<br />- You do not get bored. You have energy, you have slower jams, you have more energy, you simply have a perfect balance.<br /><br />That list is good enough. If you don't think so then you'll just have to listen to the record and make a list of your own. I love this album. And that is surely saying something considering the music I am generally in to (I'm quite partial to mostly instrumental post rock. Big shift for me). Please, please give this a listen. I know that I am five years too late at reviewing this thing, but hopefully somebody will be a late-comer like I was and see something good still coming from it. It really is a fantastic album.ever I try to think of something specific, my mind simply jumps to other things that stand out to me.

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Put it this way: you, the viewer of DW's movies, are a piece of clay in his hands. He can twist you, do whatever he likes. The man is a genius. And this movie gives him plenty of opportunities to do so. And he doesn't miss one!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wish I could give it 10 stars. Excellent character acting, tremendous blend of plots, good moral resolutions, forgiveness and mercy unconditional love ,conversion to new ways and wholesomeness wins out, a real treat in so many ways when will we have season 4
B008M87GJK|5.0|Good source of information on US and world news.  Many news outlets in the US do not report many of the world's reports, but BBC does.  The science and technology sections are up-to-date and relevant.  A good resource.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was good and kept me interested the entire time I was reading.  I'm not sure I liked the ending.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've watched Walking Dead from the beginning, and kept telling my son that he should watch it. He just wouldn't listen to me, as sons often do, but then his girlfriend talked him into watching. They ended up having to rent each episode of Season 3 to catch up. He loves it! Didn't I tell him that in the first place? Mother knows best!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I loved this fantasy series and I am very glad that I got the 4 book bundle at a reduced price. The Kindle version is much easier to handle than the bulky hardcovers or paperbacks and anyone who loves fantasy fiction, action or intriguing characters should consider reading this series.  Not recommended for those who are very young or sensitive to violence or sexual content.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|The book is the essential Batman book.<br />If not for this book you would not have had the Tim Burton Batman or the Chris Nolan Batman.<br />This book re-invented Batman and is responsible for what he is today.<br /><br />Every Batman fan should watch this movie!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This was recommended by someone in my writing group and it is a Pulitzer Prize winner. More than 20 years after being published, and more than 30 years after it was written, the story's humor still works. I know the difficulty in writing humor and view this book as both entertainment and an inspiration to that genre. This story will probably appeal to older readers.  Younger readers or those easily offended by off color humor may not appreciate it as much.
B009G9Z08S|4.0|The book is the essential Batman book.<br />If not for this book you would not have had the Tim Burton Batman or the Chris Nolan Batman.<br />This book re-invented Batman and is responsible for what he is today.<br /><br />That being said I always found the first half to be weaker than the second half.<br />But this is a great start!<br /><br />After seeing Part 1 I couldn't wait to see Part 2!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I give 5 star ratings to books that keep me up well past my bedtime and that leave me wanting more when I get to the last page. Anyone who loves fantasy will want to read this, but the characters and action transcend the genre and should appeal to anyone who enjoys any kind of adventure. The only caution is that the violence and sexuality may offend certain readers, otherwise enjoy.
B0054JURZA|5.0|I enjoy every track and the distinctive sound of this group.  I'll be following their music, new releases, and tours.
B000OIZSVY|5.0|A great and entertaining book for anyone who reads, writes or edits.  It is possible to learn something even while chuckling through the true life examples that have made it into print. The ability to cajole someone into being a bit more diligent about their grammar and punctuation without beating them over the head with it deserves a 5 star rating.
B0010T0JBA|4.0|bueno excelente producto solo un poco pesado, esta fue un regalo para un amigo  excellent product good just a little heavy, this was a gift for a friend
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I heard good things about this story from several sources and I was not disappointed.  The story itself is very simple but the skillful use of point of view and humor made this a charming and delightful read that is appropriate for anyone who loves a good story that is well told.  It will make you smile and cry.
0451228375|1.0|I have to say that, having read his previous work &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;, I was extremely disappointed in this sequel.<br /><br />I found the many references to the characters of the the original novel to be a sign that the author did not really believe in this story. Many events and ideas in &#34;World without End&#34; seems to have been copied from its predecessor: the collapse of the cathedral, the towns financial troubles, the gifted and romantically troubled young mason who goes on an incredible journey across Europe to learn new things (and happens to be a descendent of Jack Jackson), the sibling rivalry, the super holy person (in this case Caris) who sorts out the towns problems and the modern attitudes of many of the characters to homosexuality and sexuality in general.<br /><br />I also found many of the chapters, especially those concerning Gwenda and her family, to be very weak and unengaging while the ending for Gwenda seemed to be one part simple (killing two battle hardened veterans with ridiculous ease) and one part &#34;after-school special&#34; with Gwenda realising how much Wulfric loves her.<br /><br />All in all, I would only read this book once and then never again.
B008B68IV8|3.0|My daughter really wanted a Ghoulia to add to her collection.  The image for this doll represents a very chic character with stylish hair.  The doll I received has the typical &#34;all over the place,&#34; curly hair that Ghoulia normally sports.  I would not have purchased her if I had known she would look like this.  Amazon, please take a picture of the actual product and not the prototype.  This doll is misrepresented.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Good book.  I really enjoyed it.  Look forward to reading his other works.  The book really flowed and continued to keep me interested in it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very detailed writing teaches you to have a working knowledge of some of the basics of law.  Would definitely recommend to others
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I feel in love with these characters! Strength, faith, love & more strength! This book will stick with me for a long time.
0385535147|3.0|This book was evidence of Grisham's craft.  Not a great novel, but readable.  It wanders in places; and a little unbelievable. But then again so are most (all) of his novels; but you know that going in.  As with most (all) Grisham's books he has a very particular social agenda; this time regarding the abuse of power by the FBI and Attorney General; especially the use of RICO laws.  Can't say I disagree, but becomes a little heavy handed.  Good read; not spectacular.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you love dogs, you will love reading this book!  I stayed up way too late each night reading it.  Highly recommend it!
0143119680|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this story from an entertainment perspective. A Discovery of Witches chronicles journey of a woman named Diana Bishop who tries to deny her true identity as a gifted witch, magic inherited through her family. As is the case for any individual in literary history who tries to deny their true nature, it of course refuses to be hidden and the truth of who she really is comes to search Diana out. I enjoyed the historical bits embedded into the story and could appreciate the variety of characters, from vampires and daemons to ordinary humans who all play their unique role in helping Diana discover her true self. This story had love, adventure and mystery - what more could I want to find in a good book?!
B00448VST6|5.0|You need a sixth star. And it should only be valid for this product. I'm sure one of your developers can throw this together in a matter of hours. And, if they've seen this film, they will be absolutely willing to. The sound, visual style, and story of this film transcend reality in just the right way - you'll feel like you're in one of your own daydreams.<br /><br />Buy this film. Please. You won't regret it.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|My only experience with Stephen King has been the horror stories.  My daughter told me about this book. I bought  it and began reading.  I couldn't put it down.  The time travel concept is extremely well done. I have since recommended it to others, who feel the same way.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|She writes beautifully about simple people and complicated emotions. When finished with a story, I either feel surprised or familiar or sad. But I feel.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Almost every song from the movie is here - the only one we miss is Titanium.  Longer version of cups included
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is really fun for all ages and skill levels.  it has many challenges so even when you think you are good it gives you a challenge.  this game is a favorite of all ages in our house.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|EVERY LINE IN THIS SITCOM BRINGS A LAUGH FROM BEGINNING TO END.  BESIDES THE TWO FEMALE STARS, THE REST OF THE CAST MAKES THIS SHOW A HIT.  LOVE WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
B001C5ZR1E|4.0|I recommend this album to any generation - my son has picked up on The Who and can't stop playing them now. try it again ifyou haven't listened for a while.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy still writes such deep, compelling page turners.  With other writers I'm reluctant to read anything that is co-written but not with him.  I've really enjoyed the introduction over the past few years with Jack Jr., a nice way to refresh the Jack Ryan legacy.  Well done!
B001KZVQJI|4.0|A lot of interesting things that REALLY added to the version we have all seen.More creepy giant insects,more dinosaurs ,some<br />further insights on just what kind of  person Carl Denham (Jack Black) really is,A  bit of funny fighting between Adrien Brody and crew,with a&#34; wet&#34; monster,But way too much wasted time pre Skull island.I am very glad at home you can pause the film go to the<br />toilet grab a drink and extra popcorn.It all adds up  to a mostly interesting extension,but, boy am I glad you can fast forward through some of the less than thrilling add ons.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Tells if a woman finding herself and love along the way. Very cute & romantic. A little predictable. Big suspense at the end....
B002361MLA|5.0|I've used this book as a reminder to be present and aware, for the past several years.  I either just open it to a random page (which usually speaks to an issue I need to pay attention to), or each morning I read a page or two at a time and continue from cover-to-cover and then start over.  Though it basically contains a very simple message, while going through it again and again, I always seem to read something significant that I'd failed to notice any other time I'd read it.  I'm very grateful for this wonderful book.
1451648537|5.0|I am pleased with the book, it get in Italy super fast and without any problems, so I am one satisfied customer. :}
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|As much as I enjoyed this book, I couldn't help feeling like there was something missing once I finished it. I still haven't figured out what that \\"something\\" is, I just feel it.<br /><br />But don't let that stop you from reading it!<br /><br />This is a great book! I did enjoy getting to know Travis (and swooning over him), Abby, America, Shep and Parker. Though I felt Parker's only claim to fame in this novel was to show Abby what she thinks she needs (as America pointed out). Travis and Abby's love-hate-love relationship kept me up until the wee hours of the morning just to find out what would happen to them in the end. It was a real roller coaster! The characters felt like real people to me, someone I could meet on the street. I loved watching the changes in Travis and even in Abby as they came together.<br /><br />Overall, a great read, but I don't think I will read it again.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|As the subject suggests, this season is very bloody. I love these kind of tv shows and movies, so if you like that stuff, this is definitely for you. The story line is also very good and there are a lot of surprises and people from the first season there.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|The most wooden acting I have ever seen. I thought something was weird while watching it, then I remembered these are real Navy Seals. Stick to your day job boys, you're much better at it
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I really like this game.  It goes from easy to challenging quickly.  I wish you could choose any free give always because I'd already purchased the one they gave yesterday.  But that is / just bad luck, not the game's fault.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I've always wanted to publish my own books, so I started to do some research.  I read [[ASIN:B00B1YQNG4 Kindle Publishing Unleashed]] by Lilly Sage and it really opened my eyes.  Then I found \\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\" and it filled in the blanks and explained the nuts and bolts behind formatting your book for Kindle.  It's a great starting point and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to publish for Kindle.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I choose these rating because this is a great book and I can wait till the next one comes<br />out

B000YK67JE|5.0|…with this unique old world copy.<br /><br />Yes even today they are producing complete Austin novel books. But they cannot compare to the Modern Library Giant version. Most now days most of the copies of this book have that Mylar dust jacket to protect what is left of the original dust jacket.<br /><br />The books you can replace and conserve space in the library are:<br />Sense and Sensibility<br />Pride and Prejudice<br />Mansfield Park<br />Emma<br />Northanger Abbey<br />Persuasion<br /><br />Of course if you are buying a complete Novels book you already know what is in it. This book is the Novels with nothing more or less.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Slow start. But once Amy shows her true colors it moves at a brake neck pace,with many twists and often unexpected turns.  The character development of both Amy  and Nick  and  the story presentation in alternating chapters was well  done. I will read another of her novels.
B000HSKUBE|1.0|I don't know who came up with the idea of shooting this series in almost total darkness.  I find it so irritating I can hardly watch it.  It is dark at all times.  Let us see what is going on.  We know Washington is morally dark but you can turn the light on and let us see the characters. Walking down to the basement in the dark is nuts and dangerous. Everywhere it is dark, dark, dark.
B00683JK9K|4.0|First, the game doesn't tell you, but you Need To Know:  the pieces will NOT go together unless they are rotated in the right orientation.  Because you can't rotate connected groups of attached pieces-- so they need to be upright before they will attach.  So, if you see two pieces that you absolutely KNOW they go together, but they won't... rotate the suckers.<br /><br />Also, the magnifying glass is not a zoom in/out tool.  Clicking it will show you the preview picture of the puzzle you're working on.  Although it was more of a challenge not to be able to see it :X<br /><br />When you finish a puzzle, it doesn't tell you how much time you took.  That was a nifty little thing I found I missed from when I used to play Flash versions of jigsaw puzzles.<br /><br />For BlueStacks:<br />I'm running this on my BlueStacks emulator.  I'm finding the 'tray' for the puzzle pieces to be very annoying.  Most of the time, it ignores the mouse wheel.  Half of the time it ignores me when I click and drag up or down.  And at least half of the time when I do get the pieces to move, when I let go they zoom up or down uncontrollably and I lose my place.  This may not apply to your device, but may be related to BlueStacks.<br /><br />The pictures are fantastic, and the music is relaxing classical strings.
0066620996|3.0|observations:<br />1. the author claims that luck has nothing to do with these 15yr runs of success. But, the 'humble' CEO's of these companies like to say they were just \\"lucky\\"..,one even wrote a book \\"I am a lucky guy\\"<br /><br />2. these hugely successful companies,..isn't Circuit City all but wiped out?<br /><br />3. Technology doesn't drive success? I'd say Amazon is eating into Walmart due in great part to it's new tech edge.<br /><br />4. the author claims there is no 'event' that marks the transition from good to great, rather it's an accumulation of work,..but the first two companies he talks about went \\"great\\" due to single events: Kimberly got rid of it's paper mills, Walgreens closed it's restaurants.<br /><br />I'm lazy, I want specific ideas for improving my business, starting from page ONE. Not vague concepts, like \\"hire the right people\\"...
B00A85EMVK|2.0|This review is about the new 3D version of TOP GUN and not the story itself. TOP GUN has been around in so many different formats that anyone that likes this type of movie should already be familar with the story.<br /><br />The TOP GUN 3D case includes two discs, a Blu-ray 2D and Blu-ray 3D disc. There is also an UlTRAVIOLET Code to Download a Digital Copy.<br /><br />Both Blu-ray discs have three audio choices: DTS Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital sound.<br /><br />The video of the 2D TOP GUN Blu-ray is as good or better than previous releases of this title. The audio from both discs is also excellent.<br /><br />The big disappointment is the 3D BD version, which is probably the main reason someone would buy this movie re-release. The video noise is so great that it is one of the worse grainy blu-rays I've seen. Even with turning the sharpness all the way down on my OPPO BD Player the grain was still unsatisfactory. I also checked the disc on a Panasonic 3D BD Player and the grainy picture was still present.<br /><br />Yes, the 3D effect of the jets in the air does add depth enhancement but the grain problem distracted so much I would just rather watch the 2D version or turn-on the simulated 3D feature of my 3D HDTV.<br /><br />TOP GUN is one of my all time favorite movies and was the disc of choice to demo back in the days of Laser Discs. It is regrettable the studio did not do a better job in making the 3D pristine clear like so many other remastered old movies.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is by far one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time.  The author does a fantastic job building the characters and environment.  The story feels original and epic.  I have recommended it to all of my friends.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Was a very different book and i could not get into it,it chopped and changed each paragraph from one writter to another i ended up giving up half way through
B00BIR381W|4.0|I love Pretty Little Liars. Is one of the shows that you can't get enough of. This season is a little bit more about the feelings and every-day situations of the characters instead of A (like in seasons one and two), so here you get to see more about how the characters feel with their personal issues, but at the same time the A mystery that never stops.<br />This season is full of twists, mysteries and crazy moments, and I think Pretty Little Liars is getting better and better in each season, it pushes everything a little bit more as the show grows. If you're a fan of the show, don't doubt on buying it! You'll get addicted episode by episode.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Was a great book from start to finish.Not a dull moment.Kept me in and very interested right from the start with a few good twists and turns along the way.
0099579928|5.0|This is a very addictive series.  Very entertaining.  Erotic, with an understanding of why people do what they do.  Each chapter ends in a way that you HAVE to read the next...maybe that is why I read all 3 books in 1 week!
B00005JKHP|3.0|Dreck.<br /><br />Just kidding.<br /><br />No, actually I'm not.<br /><br />In my opinion, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) is just mediocre.  I must say that this movie is long and boring.  The characters in the Star Trek universe seem to have no personality.  They deliver robotic dialogue and come across as wooden and stiff.  When I compare the characters in the Star Trek movies to the characters of the Star Wars movies, there's no comparison.  In Star Wars there's C3PO, R2D2, Chewbacca, Han, Leia, Luke, Vader, Lando, Yoda, Kenobi, and on and on and on.  All of these characters have personalities and are well developed characters overall.  In contrast, the Star Trek movies have characters that are just sort of...............blah.  Now, I must say that in the Star Wars prequels there are some boring characters and some with robotic dialogue (like Queen Amidala in The Phantom Menace), but on the whole the characters of Star Wars totally destroy the characters in Star Trek.  No comparison.  In this Star Trek movie I'm reviewing, the bald woman reminds me of Queen Amidala in the way she delivers her lines.  Robotic and stiff as a board.  I also prefer the \\"used universe\\" (as George Lucas calls it) of Star Wars over the squeaky clean environments of Star Trek.  Sure, George Lucas was influenced by Star Trek to a certain extent as well as Flash Gordon, Dune, etc., but it doesn't mean that Star Trek is superior to Star Wars simply because it blazed the trail.  Not by a long shot.  I can respect the whole Star Trek franchise, the TV show from the '60s, etc., but it just can't compare to Star Wars, at least for this reviewer.  Another thing - the success of Star Wars (1977) is what set plans in motion to make Star Trek: The Motion Picture, so in a way, Star Wars was a trailblazer for the creation of the Star Trek movies.  Not only that, but the colorful characters of Star Wars influenced the makers of these Star Trek movies to make the Star Trek characters more colorful in the future movies in the series, by adding humor, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a terrible movie, but it's not good, either.  It's heavy on special effects and light on story and plot.  Imagine watching boring, stiff characters with robotic dialogue and a bunch of special effects.  That's what you get when you watch this movie.  Even a great director like Robert Wise couldn't save this movie from mediocrity.  The best Star Trek movie was the second one, called The Wrath Of Khan.  I saw that movie in the theater when it came out.l in the future movies in the series, by adding humor, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a terrible movie, but it's not good, either.

I feel like my sister did an excellent job picking this CD out for my birthday. :)

B008RA3X5E|3.0|Forgot that with this app Kindle would use up a lot of battery to work right.  I Leave it on the nightstand but makes me use my kindle a little less as I need to constantly plug it in for the night and the day.<br /><br />Probably better used for travellers who like to have their kindle be their alarm clock.

B005R32L66|4.0|I dont know why but for some reason, after I use skype on my Android tablet to dial in to my voicemail or conference numbers, it wont make the sound when I hit the # or * key.  It does not do that when I used my iPad or Android phone version of skype.<br /><br />Other than that, I use it a lot and it saves me a lot of minutes on my cell phone plan.  Its a good bargain for only 3 bucks a month.

B005K17RU0|2.0|I find it annoying that this app has only a single screen orientation and  is incapable of reorienting itself as the device rotates.  I use it on a Kindle, and it is always upside down (due to the way the cover opens).  I have no other app with this limitation.

B00170F0WU|5.0|How did I miss the film when it came out? The acting was great. The young girl gave performance that I would expect from a much more mature person. The plot was different than anything I can remember. The opening got my attention, and I was surprised with what followed. I also love NYC, so the setting made it all the more ejnoyable.

B008RJFRTK|1.0|This really doesn't owrk very well.  It may be that you need a large tablet to use this. On my 7&#34; tablet, if I enlarge enough to make it readable, I see such a small zone thsat I can't figure out exactly where I am or where I need to go. Also, this failed my &#34;Neighborhood test&#34;. e.g.  the street where I live is shown but not named, and it is a reasonably long street with about 10 intersections.

B0037RDPEG|3.0|It was like the curates egg -- good in parts. I struggled with sections of the book. The time in India was heavy going and I considered giving up on it. However, I stuck with it and ended up quite enjoying the last part of the book.

B00005N9CV|5.0|I echo what another reviewer said ...stunning.<br />  Diana is a master of any material she sings, hard driving or<br /> soft and tender.  AND you get to hear her sensitive terrific piano<br /> playing.<br />  When I listen to this album I get tears in my eyes, every time.<br />  Diana.....S' wonderful!!!  Don't miss any of her albums.<br />  This one has a sensual bossa nova background thruout. It just glows.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book is interesting but the ending is somewhat abrupt. This leaves the reader hanging and wondering about what it all means.
B003UESJF6|5.0|It's a good movie. The graphics are good, the plot is good, and the characters (for what it's worth) are believable.<br />I bought it because I like this type of movie...
B007SGM084|5.0|What a wonderful love story. I can't wait to read it again. The story is more about his journey than hers as the backs of the books would have you believe
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Easy to update, edit, retrieve, and review.  This app makes it easy for me to take notes and record any thought or list I might have need of later.
0978545095|5.0|I bought this book and the other one, called &#34;Street Photographer&#34;. They are both excellent, but I find the prints in this book to have more depth and contrast. It also has a nice introduction and descriptions of Maier's life and the history of the found negatives. Occasionally a page will be devoted to a contact sheet of one of Maier's rolls of film. It is amazing the rate of keepers that she could achieve.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not just a children's book, it's a book about finding yourself and what figuring out what you believe in and stand for.  Definitely the best one in the series.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual, this DeMille book was spellbinding, suspenseful, and humorous, all within a very credible plot.  I was saddened when I got to the end and had to lay it aside.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really good game and I recommend it to everyone. It remindes me of temple run alot but kind of better :)
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Solid show.  Borrows a bit from Nolan's Batman Trilogy, but still fresh enough to be interesting.  Lead actor is terrific.  Felicity, Dig and the Russian are also excellent.  Dual storylines and entertaining action sequences are terrific.  Watch the first three episodes to get a solid feel for the show.  I, for one, will keep watching...
B00A757EFW|1.0|very old school and annoying. deleted it right away because of graphics and not fun at all. needs better graphics
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Before CGI took over Hollywood spectacle, this is how they did it. Beautiful to watch. They actually wreck a train!. Plus, it gives great insight into how the world works today.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|don't know what I did wrong but it's just a surch engine that doesn't really do me any good. It's just as easy to go to WEB and do a search rather than going thru this app
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Two childhood friends finding each other after 13 years...<br /><br />The best first kisses without even kissing expressed in such a loving and romantic way. Not to mention, how Holder's love for Sky goes beyond all self. Just true love!<br /><br />You won't regret it. One of the best book you would ever read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it and it has way better graphics than the first one and I think every one should rate this five stars
B000MQRE4C|5.0|Stellar writing and story from Thackery, the locales and costume design are ethereal. Crystal's cooter exploded when she immersed herself in the film

B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I love Josh Groban and have all of his albums.  \\"Echoes\\" doesn't live up to the others.  His voice is so wonderful that he doesn't need to resort to the falsettos he uses in some songs.  That's just too gimicky for someone with his talent.  I too have trouble making out the lyrics in this album.  Josh, you can certainly do better!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was obsessed with this show when i was 13/14 years old. I was heartbroken when they cancelled it. I saw this on Amazon and couldnt believe it!!! I received it and the packaging is so nice! comes with an awesome book inside with cool info that looks like a composition book. I have been waiting years to find somethign like this. I can still hum the theme song in my head. This is one of the best written and well played shows i have ever seen in my life to this day. And lets say now, i am out of my 20's... lol. I cant wait till one day i can show this to my daughter/s. it still touches me to the core and I can still relate to this even as an adult. the actors are all phenominal. every christmas i always want to watch the episode with ricky being homeless :( I LOVEEEEE that episode and now i can! I also love the Halloween episode with nicky driscoll! lol. i can rmemeber almost every episode and line in my head as if i were 14 years old again in my bedroom in my parents house. Best purchase I've made in a long time. If you havent seen this GET IT. You will love it I guarantee it.

B008S847X2|3.0|It's tough to believe that an accomplished musician and bandleader like JM would allow the persistent and excessive 'crash cymbal' to subvert the underlying guitar and musicianship expected in the album.  If the goal was to hide the flaws or substandard playing, mission accomplished.  Really too bad.  I had to use a graphic equalizer to control the harshness of the continuous crash cymbal to the detriment of the rest of the music.  Much more would have been added with less of the drum and cymbal choices.  Let's call it being out of sync with the heart of the music.<br />A very fine effort distorted by an overbearing crash cymbal.  If you can unmix the persistent high frequencies, there's good music in there somewhere.<br />Three stars to reflect the potential.  JM is better - much better - than this production.
B009G3T01M|5.0|has a few really good songs to it, like Thrift Shop its about time someone rapped about being poor rather then being rich :-D just because they rapped about being poor they get 5 stars from me!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I just love this movie!  So funny and clever.  We watch this movie every Xmas.  It wouldn't be Xmas without it.
B0053O89JM|5.0|An awesome conclusion to the show, and it will not leave you disappointed. Just try to pace yourself on episodes, unlike me.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I loved most of the songs!  I just love his voice and style.  Glad he won American Idol this year.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing!!!!!! I loved it!!!!  The book leaves you on a cliff and the next one does not come out till fall 2013 .  :(  that is frustrating.  I wish the author would write faster. But other than that the book was good. It had a lot of action and I love action. Also no sad or boring parts. Be ready to have trouble trying it put the book down. Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. Crystal
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|when I saw the pictures to the game I was like whatever but when I started playing I had my friends sleeping over my house tor two weeks. I just could not stop playing and trust me you wont either. you will wish this game wont have that scary scary effect that it gives you
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing is all I can say. This book left me on the edge of my chair and I couldn't put it down
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|McKenna takes a brush and paints a wonderful picture of the characters and their surroundings. Well written book with a troubling part of Irish history woven throughout the story. You will laugh and cry all the way to the happy ending.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Vivid colors, beautiful pics. I have the free version and so far it's all good. Lots of options. You can choose your puzzle, how many pieces, and even if you want only end pieces first. I always like to put the edges together first, make the frame and then fill it in. I like this app. Glad I downloaded it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love this game so ya but this game also is kinda boring the only fun part about it was the contest
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a fun game with lots of storyline and tons of puzzles to play. The hint feature is handy if you get stuck. I was really impressed with the number of places to explore for lots of play time.  Quite the bargain at 3x the cost!
B0085OELXK|1.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but this movie was pretty dark. I didn't appreciate the premise of the movie, and didn't find any redeeming reason to watch it. There wasn't anything that offered hope in my opinion. Just a dark story about a crazy person.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|My review of this book is .....<br /><br />It helps me when I come across a word I don't know what it means
0446554995|3.0|Two Graves has the usual assortment of technical errors that we have come to expect from this pair. The worst being the part played in the plot by a third-grade level misunderstanding of how acetylene torches function. This was of a mental gag sort that did help draw attention away from the predictability of the plot. The usual midinformation pertaining to firearms appears the result of assumptions based on a poor source, perhaps a catalog for an auction? The obligatory underground scenes filled with creepy crawlers crops up yet again. Really could have been a lot better with some effort.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A loyal Pendergast fan here!  He never disappoints!<br />It was exciting and  kept  the  story going talking about  how the Nazi's lived.
B003G4IXA6|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard in years.  I love the concept of Slash just jamming with a bunch of different artists and styles.  He may not have been the first to it.  He's just the best to do it!  I do wish it included the bonus tracks released in a few different methods, but the tracks included rival the best of Velvet Revolver.  If you enjoy Slash's guitar work this is an absolute must have.  The fact that it is available on vinyl is a double bonus!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the first game I have played on my new kindle. I don't even want to try other games. Its that good.
B0017WCERM|5.0|Metallica's first five albums are the absolute pinnacle of metal and this release is the best of the best.  The group really came into their own here and this is pure distilled aggression before any commercial concerns crept into the music.  This includes tributes to rage, insanity, and H.P. Lovecraft as well as lyrical indictments of drugs, religion, and the military.  And all this done in long form arrangements as radio unfriendly as it gets.  Throw in a creepy understated cover for good measure.  What more could you ask for!
B0081336FO|5.0|Rapier sharp writing and superb acting make this an outstanding series.  Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is hot and Martin Freeman's Watson is the heart of the show.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Great love story. Can't wait to see how the other books turn out. Hope they don't disappoint.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Another great iTree game.  All different levels making some more challenging that others that keeps you coming back for more.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Thanks to HBO i found this awesome series, and startet reading em. And am i glad i did!<br /><br />I like the style that each chapters has its own POV character. Its well wrinten and its an amazing story, a great follow up from the frist book. If you like the series i can only recommend trying reading the books!
0143038583|5.0|Much of what's in \\"Omnivorse's Dilemma\\" has been covered by the mainstream media by now, but this book really helped to put those issues on the map. The power of the writing and the layering of examples in this book keep the material fresh and relevant, and even shocking at times.<br /><br />Michael Pollan isn't exactly on a crusade to make us become vegetarians, but he is on a crusade to change how and what we eat. He attacks the industrial-style farming and meat-raising practices that have overtaken our food chain since the 1970s. He explains why the food system is damaging our environment, our health, the taste of our foods, and our very souls. And he makes a convincing case of it, all the while stretching back in history to centuries of farming practices and eating and drinking habits. It's amazing to think about what food means to humans, that the complexity of finding food, deciding we want to eat it, and preparing it for our digestive system might be the thing that led to our brain development and surely led to the start of our cultures and societies.<br /><br />The book's most important revelations are in the first few chapters, when Pollan describes how corn has become the crop that feeds us, either directly through foods and high-fructose corn syrup, or indirectly as feed for cattle, chickens, and even fish. Corn has certain attributes that make it an ideal crop (high productivity, huge growing range, ease of standardization), but those ideals taken to their current extreme are harming us. Pollan explains why Iowa and other farm states have become \\"corn desserts,\\" that is, areas devoid of other crops, except for soybeans planted in rotation with corn.<br /><br />The demands for corn have forced the excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers that damage the land. Then, because excess corn is grown each year by farmers desperate to pay their mortgages and to purchase genetically modified corn seed, corn processors and food marketers have employed an increasing array of tactics to sell that corn. Those actions have created their own detrimental effects, such as cattle fed a diet to which they are unsuited, and all feed animals living horrid lives in tight, contaminated pens and houses. All this culminates, of course, in us eating crappy food that is saturated with fat and sugars.<br /><br />But Pollan doesn't stop there. He looks into the emerging organic movement to find out if it has the solution, and he pulls back the cloak on this fast-growing segment of the business. It turns out that organic farms are reaching industrial-size proportions, too, and facing many of the same problems of a monoculture operation, high-volume operation.<br /><br />So then Pollan looks at small-scale farmers who are challenging the tide, and he finds a ray of hope. But he also recognizes the production limits of these integrated, no-pesticide farms. Same thing with his final chapters, which look at the subculture of folks who forage and hunt for their food, which is more of an avocation than a realistic way to live. Cool stuff, but not necessarily practical for the busy suburban parent (and, to his credit, Pollan acknowledges this dilemma, too).<br /><br />Every chapter of the book contains valuable insights and surprises. It surely makes you think about what you're eating and makes you shake your head at the government's support of what are clearly unhealthy farming and meat-raising practices across the country. As foodborne illnesses rise in frequency and severity and as obesity continues to claim more lives, we are seeing an awareness of the damage that our corn dependence has created. Michael Pollan has helped to raise those issues and to suggest some solutions. Let's hope that more and more people take inspiration from his ideas.
B000UD08HW|3.0|Disappointed with video quality...purchased the blu-ray version expecting much more. The music itself was excellent but wondered why Crosby, Nash (zzzzzzz) & Bowie were included in this concert. Seems like an odd mix of musicians.<br /><br />Would buy again but not the blu-ray version.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book is a old and amazing classic I recommend it to everyone young and old. I personally think that it is better than the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Can't wait for the next book by ths author. A kind of story that stay with you after you finish reading.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Seemed a little anti-climatic. I really liked the first book and felt they went downhill. Also, I am reading this as an adult, not a teenager so that might make a difference.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|I was very disappointed.  Not much different than the first one.  I'm glad I saw it in standard DVD version, as I was thinking of buying the 3D version.  I would have been really disappointed to have paid $20+ for a movie that was just &#34;ok&#34;.
B009LH1WLO|4.0|Hey hi.... um where is episode 15? I love the whole series as a whole. Jensen and Jared are amazing!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who has ever listened to his music.  I learned so much about him as a person and Rastafari movement.
145210655X|5.0|Really great book; and way more pages than I realized. Some of the comics are sweet, some are funny, and there are plenty of great references to the movies. I can't wait to give this to my dad for his birthday! Vader's Little Princess will definitely be his fathers day present, as well!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|That's a voice!  Few voices have the ability to take you along god and bad, happy and sad.  I'm no blues expert, but I sure as hell can enjoy good music and this is beyond good.
B003UYV08E|5.0|very good
B008AVYOBC|5.0|There were videos I had never seen until now, this is the perfect gift the Nanas could have come up with for long time fans like me.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|It is a fun movie to watch with lots of action.  I like movies where the actors are on a quest, which this movie has.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|Elysium is a great album for a loungy night with friends, I find it goes well with expensive wine.  Their lyrics continue to surprise.  The fluency throughout is a plus.  It's the type of music you hear in upscale ultra chic places, but you don't have to be that much of a snob to enjoy it...just a little!
B004T32SOK|3.0|I use this site for photos.  Not what I would call fast but does work and is easy to use.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|A perfect album, you may find yourself smiling like a kid in love while listening to it. It's a fact, pop can be art.  Just buy it, you will enjoy it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|what can i say that hasnt already been said about this beast? overclocks very well, no complaints. very happy with this purchase.
B008458O3S|4.0|A fresh idea in the Casual Game category! Unlike most others offered here, this is NOT a remake of something else.<br /><br />Trainyard offers a simple premise, addicting puzzles to complete, and is challenging enough to keep you entertained long after installation (It's held my interest for many months).<br /><br />About the only critique I can think of is that touch occasionally misinterprets the tracks I'm trying to place. This is easily overcome by going over the square in the grid again though.<br /><br />Great for all ages!
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|I don't know if it has been mentioned here in the reviews - Most of it was filmed at Disneyworld movie studios.  I was there and saw the studio from above and saw many small individual rooms that they filmed in.  I looked for Tom Hanks and Ron Howard and never saw them.<br /><br />They went thru so much trouble to make it more authentic.  I enjoy the space movies that show us what it was like during the events of our space exploration.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Same great acting and production, but the storylines were not as enjoyable as the first two seasons.  Not sure how I feel looking towards the fourth season.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Great reading.  Hard to put down.  A must read for anyone following this book series.  Some women may enjoy the love story inside.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Laughed, cried, and fell in love with Ana and Christian myself. I may have to do some research of my own after reading this book ;).
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Honestly, everyone has been talking it up so much that I was expecting something REALLY good.  I was let down.  It was &#34;OK&#34;, but nothing game-changing.  To me, it feels like the genre has become &#34;stale&#34;.
B00846REIS|1.0|When an author can not write a book with her own ideas, she really should not be a writer.  Save your time and money.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Even though this was not a true story per say, sadly some of the things the author wrote about the orphange did happen in the 50's . I liked the ending of the book but I think it would of been a little better if the author continued the story beyond finding out that they were  brother and sister  maybe another book with their continuing story ??  I would buy it in a heart beat
B0034G4OYA|4.0|Now this movie was great. The whole family like this movie,made you laugh, wonder, and think. Good fun all around!!!!!!!!!!!!
0802130208|3.0|I did not read this book but gave it away as a gift to someone who ask about it. Sorry
B007REV4T8|4.0|This movie I really enjoyed, like most 007 movies. This movie was one of Daniel Craig's better 007 movies, not that I didnt like the others. This movie WAS MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Did not fully enjoy movie. I paid for HD, got SD. Otherwise it was a very engrossing and action-filled movie.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was awesome, I had a picture in my mind of these two characters and when I finally saw the movie the other night, I was on point.
B001TH16DS|5.0|As reviewed by others, the Blu-ray is great.<br /><br />The only thing i don't like, in fact i'm beginning to really hate it, is the sound loop the thing play as it's waiting for you the choose a video... but face it, ALL Blu-ray and DVDs have something similar, and after a while they all get on you nerves.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Purchasd as a christmas gift to my oldest daughter and she wanted to watch the whole series in one shot, she loved it very much
B00005614M|4.0|OK, so it's not my all time favorite CD... but it's Miles Davis, the tracks play, what's not to like.
B000OT8GCQ|2.0|Didn't care for it much, haven't watched the movie either even though I love Channing. Sorry but It dragged way to long for me.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ordered this book because of all the hype and was grossly disappointed.  It appeared to be no more than a classic woman's romance novel and the author was told to make any money she should add sex, and to make a lot more money add kinky sex.<br /><br />I am no prude, but the separation of the romance and the kinky sex was all too transparent.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed my first Sylvia Day novel and found myself really loving the depth of her characters.  She tells a great story of the two main characters finding each other and trying to build a relationship despite their damaged pasts. My only complaint is that the book ended way too soon without resolving what happened with them, at least for me! I'm off now to see if I can find a Book II!!
1419705849|5.0|My 9 year old would read for hours when it comes to the DOWK books!  This one did not disappoint.
1936608898|5.0|The information contained in \\"It Starts With Food\\" reinforces everything I have learned about a healthy lifestyle over the past 2 years.  I have already shared the book with several friends... and I don't take the information contained lightly as it really has saved my life.  Having several health conditions that were compounded by obesity, losing weight without starving myself has been a true pleasure.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Was expecting something more Twilight-ish and was pleased to find that there was much more to these books.  While the romance can indeed be a little teeny-bopp-ish, the characters are intelligent and the author's attention to historical detail renders the story more realistic, if a world of &#34;creatures&#34; can be considered realistic.  Couldn't wait to get to the second book, which I enjoyed even more.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I LOVE this product and it does everything stated. I really like how you can have a voice tell you your battery is low besides those stupid notifications.
0307719774|5.0|Bought this for my niece and I think it will be a treasure.  The concept of looking back over the years at one's answers is perfect for the journal writer in the family.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I used to play this when I was a child. I was glad to see I could download for free onto my Kindle.
145210655X|2.0|Got this for my nephew who is a Star Wars fanatic.  Did not really find much of the humor very funny at all.  Illustrations were cute, at best.
0547884591|5.0|I got this for my husband as a gift. He couldn't put it down for two months. The recipes are great (of the ones I've tried - I only eat the vegan ones but my husband and son really like the meat ones too) and simple with great tips along the way.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|MI Ghost Protocol was a excellent film to add to the series.  Also it was great to watch the film via amazon instant video during a free trial of amazon prime. I'm tempted to buy the dvd blue ready to add to the collection.
B005HSL626|5.0|This ap is free and very entertaining.  My wife and daughter took my Kindle Fire from me and played for a long time.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Really like this calculator , except it cannot be moved to the SD card. It is large file and it would be nice to move it to the storage card. I don't understand why it needs to be on the phone storage, that is why I gave it 4 stars
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Fabulous download with great quality and clarity! Also was at a great price, get this album before people start discovering this band and they jack the price up!
B002OT731E|5.0|great cd now remastered sounds even better.this is really good set of songs.5 stars for the stones.just like being at their concert.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I love Florence and all her music but this album blew me away! I love every single song and the more I listen the more surprises I find in the lyrics and melodies. She is the best voice of my generation!
B004P91ARE|5.0|This was the forth time I have purchaced this album. Wore the others out you see.<br />Dave was my all time favorite jazz musition.
B001O3B2M2|5.0|Love the album and the price!!! Beautiful is my favorite song!! Older album but like it more then others I have heard!
B005LLSNNE|4.0|After watching Season 3 (my favorite so far) Season 4 started out a little slow. About halfway through<br />it started to pick up and ended on a high note, making me want Season 5 now.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Love this series for the characters, but have to turn away from the graphic forensic gore.  A frustrated love story intertwined with great science fiction.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Was terrible , I did finish it, but who needs to read about a crazy gal and a husband that put up with it.  Just goes to show how messed up our court system and mental health system are.  May have just been fiction, then the author is crazy also.  I did finish the book, but 7 from our book club of 9 did not.,
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best show right now.  Number seven of the second season.  I am enjoying every episode.Try it you will like it.
B008220BP2|4.0|This film has the clever premise that the world is being taken over by zombies and \\"bonies\\" - which are clothe-less, flesh-less and much more aggressive than the zombies. As living human beings are the only food source, they are being wiped out at a rapid rate and live in barricaded military type structures. There is one teen-zombie who still has human thoughts. He also keeps a little-mermaid-like collection of artifacts from the living in his jumbo jet home. In one killing spree, after munching down the boyfriend he finds himself attracted to the girlfriend. Another twist is that consuming the brain of the boyfriend gives him insights into the girl.<br /><br />Narration and flashbacks were frequently used to move the story along. The movie was perhaps a bit over-narrated; would have enjoyed more time focused on the budding girl-meets-zombie relationship.<br /><br />This movie stimulates the brain cells and has many many funny visual bits and dialogue. I feel like I need to watch it a few more times to fully appreciate all going on, and well might give it another star then.<br /><br />PS - The zombie boy Nicholas Hoult, now a teen, was the child star of one of the best movies ever \\"About a Boy\\" - after watching him in Warm Bodies it was fun to re-watch that film.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I will never again buy something like this from amazon! This was a joke a fake doesn't work is made out of cheap hard plastic I wasted 40 on this fake case and could have bought the real thing from Walmart obviously I didn't know this before ordering I don't even want to give this a 1 star but u have to
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|There's a saying \\"Go looking for the Devil and you will find him\\". That's pretty much what this movie is about.  Roman Polanski uses rich locations to deliver this tale and if that fails, Mr. Johnny Depp has the lead role.  Definitely not a movie for everyone but if your intrigued with conspiracy theories or the occult, this movie is a must have.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. It satisfies my puzzle fix, even without using a hint. Makes me use my problem solving skills. Too much fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game, tho slow to load. Good graphics and choices in horse colors. Becomes addicting over time, I can hardly put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute game for anyone who loves horses. Easy to play and very fun. Recommend this to any horse lover who likes games!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Very nice app for sleeping. Sounds are all very good quality and many choices to choose from. Took a while to find one that worked for me with all the choices. Getting the right volume was important me. I recommend this for anyone looking for sleep sounds.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Good book!  A real winner for a long weekend.  Highly recommend the book - wasn't surprised by the ending either.<br /><br />EXCELELNT!
B0063IH60K|2.0|This is for my daughter and it always pops up adds for dating sites.  Not appropriate for young children.  yuck
B0060MYM7O|4.0|As pretty much all the reviews say, if you have or haven't seen the show, the entire season by itself is completely worth the money.  The quality of the writing, acting, along with the elaborate sets and story line make it one of the best shows in years.  Perhaps not since &#34;Rome&#34; has HBO released such a compelling drama that seems more like a movie each episode than a show.  I can only hope that &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is not prematurely canceled due to high production costs, like &#34;Rome&#34; was in the past, despite high viewership.<br /><br />That being said, as a regular viewer of this show, I was disappointed with the extras on the Blu-Ray.  There is the commentary included on every episode and a decent amount of featurettes, but beyond that not too much.  Most of the interviews with cast and character biographies are very short in length as well.  In addition, there is a guide that you can have added to each episode, but if you watch the show regularly it really doesn't help much and blocks the screen.  I really hoped for more behind the scenes footage and other creative bonus feature ideas from HBO.<br /><br />Overall, still a very good buy and would recommend the series to all.
B00756GRUE|5.0|Chronograph function is better than Citizen Eco drive watches , best value for the price. Also better than Seiko Kinetic watches.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It's a bit depressing but a nice twist at the end.  I wouldn't purchase the book but it's ok as a rental.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Cannot stop watching this show.  TV needs more dramas like this one.  Setting, story line, clothing and especially acting is outstanding.  Maggie Smith shines.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I think it's supposed to be a &#34;girl power&#34; type book but it's extremely predictable.  The ending just dropped off.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|What an interesting story. Neatly ties all the characters story lines together at the end. I did not expect the book to end this way. Well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book The Hunger Games is an amazing story by Suzanne Collins filled with action grief and a little side dish of romance. Suzanne brought it all together in this astounding book
1250007208|4.0|I'm not accustom to reading too many fairy tale re-tellings, but after reading, Cinder I might have to make that more a part of my norm. Even knowing how the fairy tale goes and how it ends, I still found myself wondering with intense curiosity how Marissa Meyer was going to pull all of the fair tale aspects that can't be overlooked into this modern re-telling. Specifically for Cinderella: the carriage, the crystal/glass slipper, the fairy-godmother, crazy stepmother and stepsisters. And I was impressed with it all.<br /><br />Cinder did have a smidgen of a slow start for me. I'm not sure if I'm burning out from this stretch of books I've blown through recently, or if it was just a slow starting book. But the pacing was steadily increasing throughout the novel and culminated in an ending that I wanted to skim through any sort of description whatsoever just to see what happens. That's a good thing.<br /><br />Marissa Meyer did a wonderful job of making the world of the Commonwealth simultaneously historical and futuristic. And this fabulous world building has started my 2013 year off with high expectations for any other book worlds to come. I wasn't sure about the concept of Cinderella being a cyborg and all, but it works wonderfully with the world created by Marissa Meyer and would have fallen completely flat without the setting to back it.<br /><br />Cinder herself was an extremely likable character. The fact that she's honed a skill of which she can be proud of even when she's not proud of herself for being what she is--cyborg. It allows her moments of self-deprecation not to take over completely and takes a unique spin off Cinderella being basically a servant of the evil stepmother.<br /><br />Prince Kai was equally likable--though I keep running the phrase Charlotte Lucas makes in Pride and Prejudice over and over in my head. \\"There are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\" And Cinder truly gave zero encouragement. I mean I understand why, but it makes it hard to believe that Kai was able to develop too strong of an attachment to her himself.<br /><br />The ending was left wide open for the continuation of the story. Though I am somewhat disappoint to hear that the main story of book 2, Scarlet, deviates somewhat from Cinder and Prince Kai, it sounds like they will have active roles in book 2.<br /><br />Cinder gets 4 stars from me. Have you read Cinder? What did you think? Let me know!ean I understand why, but it makes it hard to believe that Kai was able to develop too strong of an attachment to her himself.<br /><br />The ending was left wide open for the continuation of the story.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely taken back by this book. The relationships between characters are so real and relatable that it makes for an easy and enjoyable read.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Incredibly well paced and documented story, scientifically sound and amazing mixture of fun and irony.<br /><br />Though faced with probably the toughest challenge a human being can endure, this astronaut has to develop his own means of survival in the desolate, barren and completely aggressive Martian environment.  In order to do so, the main character streches his imagination and creativity beyond any known limits.<br /><br />Terrific story of a survivor rather than a typical sci-fi plot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1423124111|5.0|Like millions of people, I've been a fan of Disney parks since I first went to Disneyland in 1986.  As a professional artist, I have always admired the poster art from their parks over the years and have often wanted many of them hanging on the walls in my studio.  This book does an amazing job at showcasing the artwork of these beautiful posters.  The quality of the images is top notch, the book is big enough so you see all the details, and it's great to see the pantheon of Disney park posters I never saw in the flesh from their parks all over the world.<br /><br />If you're either a Disney fan or an admirer of the dying art of poster illustration, this book is for you.  Get it now before it goes out of print and costs 300$.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|A bit wordy when it came to the technical explanations. This book was not well edited well. Overall it was just OK.
B004V71CYQ|5.0|This is such a classic 80's movie. I enjoyed it almost as much as when I was a kid. Lots of fun t watch.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is absolutely amazing and fun because you get to use power-ups and unleash bonus levels and it is so like the movie.They show the airplane, all the cages, and it's hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000001FN3|4.0|\\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" was never actually the title of a book by Edgar Allan Poe -- at least not during his lifetime.  The closest title to that, of anything published by Poe during his lifetime, was his short story collection \\"Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque\\" (1840) -- fine for Poe's time, but not a title that would grab readers nowadays.  The \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" title comes from a collection published in 1908, almost 60 years after Poe's  mysterious 1849 death in Baltimore.  Yet that is the title that has taken hold, and is no doubt the reason why, in François Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation of Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" the book that fireman Guy Montag saves from the book-burners of his totalitarian society, and commits himself to memorizing, is \\"'Tales of Mystery and Imagination' by Edgar Allan Poe.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" also became the title of a 1976 album by the Alan Parsons Project.  That band's work never did much for me -- I found their style too remote, too mechanized.  Still, as an admirer of Poe, I wanted to see what the Alan Parsons Project would do with Poe's writings; and listening to the album, I found it a pleasant and interesting approach to the great author's work.<br /><br />I'm not sure about the reason for the mummy images on the cover and within the liner notes (a reference to Poe's 1845 story \\"Some Words with a Mummy,\\" perhaps?), but the mummy illustrations and the creepy photographs in the liner notes suitably complement the album's subject matter.  The first track, \\"A Dream Within a Dream,\\" starts with Orson Welles reciting in a booming and suitably Poe-esque manner; his deep and resonant voice provides a suitable lead-in to an atmospheric instrumental characterized by a single bass-guitar note that beats like a tell-tale heart.  Arpeggio-heavy keyboards dominate, with guitars in support.  The synthesized vocals of the first part of the following song, \\"The Raven,\\" are a bit annoying; the later stanzas, sung without the synthesized voicing, work much better.  With its heavy beat, \\"The Raven\\" is almost upbeat, in a downbeat sort of way.<br /><br />\\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" is significantly more upbeat, and achieves more of a rock feel.  I remember that this song got a bit of airplay back in the 1970's.  The song slows down during the middle 8, but possesses some fine guitar work, combined with a deep, kettle-drum-type sound on the percussion.  The vocals have some soul and passion to them (not something that can always be said of this band's work), and this song rocks.<br /><br />\\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" uncoils slowly, with a sense of menace that is appropriate to a song inspired by one of Poe's grimmest tales.  I found somewhat incongruous the high harmonies that momentarily made it seem as if Daryl Hall and John Oates had flown over from Philadelphia and stopped in at the Alan Parsons Project's recording studio, but then there was a welcome return to menace, with an effective bass-and-guitar riff.<br /><br />\\"(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" bears the name of a relatively obscure Poe tale, but is probably the song that got the most radio airplay of any tune from this album.  Structurally organized around the spoken-word refrain of \\"Just what you need to make you feel better,\\" this song is fairly laden with crunchy musical hooks and some nice guitar riffs, even though it plods along in the same metronomic 4/4 time that is so characteristic of this band's work.<br /><br />It is appropriate, I suppose, that the multi-part song suite that takes up tracks 6-10 on the CD has the title of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\": this most famous of Poe's short stories has inspired entire books.  Orson Welles returns with more spoken-word narration.  (Odd that Welles mentions the year 1831, a good eight years before \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" was published in Burton's Gentleman's Magazine; but oh, well.)  This song suite with symphony orchestra begins with a great, very Poe-esque quote: \\"Without music, or an intriguing idea, color becomes pallor; man becomes carcass; home becomes catacomb; and the dead are, but for a moment, motionless.\\"  Poe may never have said that, but it captures his spirit and his aesthetic well.<br /><br />Of the six parts of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" \\"Prelude\\" is orchestral and very cinematic; \\"Arrival\\" combines \\"Phantom of the Opera\\"-style organ with synthesizer; \\"Intermezzo\\" is so short that I found myself wondering why it needed to be a track of its own; \\"Pavane\\" (the term refers to a 16th-century processional dance) is keyboard-oriented and very cinematic, with harp, harpsichord, a repeating melody, and a decided air of menace.  The last part of the song, \\"Fall,\\" sounds appropriately like the fall of something.  It is most suitable for a musical interlude meant to capture this great moment from literature: \\"My brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder -- there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters -- and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the 'House of Usher.'\\"<br /><br />After that epic, almost operatic big finish, the album concludes on a gentler note, with its final song, \\"To One in Paradise.\\"  This gentle, guitar-based song, with synthesizers in a supporting role, has a mellow flowing quality, similar to the Alan Parsons Project's 1981 hit song \\"Time,\\" but not as downbeat.  The spoken words at the end -- one last appearance by the late great Orson Welles -- are actually the fourth and final stanza of Poe's original 1833 poem \\"To One in Paradise\\": \\"And all my days are trances,/And all my nightly dreams/Are where thy grey eye glances,/And where thy footstep gleams -- /In what ethereal dances,/By what eternal streams.\\"  The way in which the band ends the album by quoting Poe directly shows how this album was conceived in a spirit of respect and appreciation for Poe's work.  If you are interested in examples of how the work of Edgar Allan Poe has impressed itself upon international popular culture, then you should find the Alan Parsons Project's \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" enjoyable.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Oh the pretty colors and the ability to move the cube around and find matches makes this a different and interesting game. My kids and I take turns finding matches. We each have 5 secs or so to find a match or lose a turn. Makes it very fast pace and loads of fun on game night.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|Big fan of many HBO and AMC shows (Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, etc).  Also avid reader of military/CIA thrillers.  This showed seemed a perfect fit given the subject matter and positive reviews.<br /><br />Purchased season 1 from Amazon (always great).  This show is predictable, silly and just plain boring.  Watched 5 episodes hoping it would get better.  It did not.  I do not know how this won so many awards.  The acting is horrible and I have little sympathy for ANY character.  Claire Danes' portrayal of a crazy, off the rails CIA agent is difficult to watch.  Damian Lewis is unbelievable from the start (not the fact that he is a terrorist).  He is &#34;over acting&#34; every scene and his dialect is not right.  Turns out he is a British actor.  Not that I have anything against British actors it is just poor casting for this role.<br /><br />Try to see an epsiode or two to see if this show is for you before you waste your money
B000VAPZM2|5.0|We enjoyed watching this musical with kids.  Very entertaining.  They were very popular a few years ago.  Worth the price
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Great show! Wonderful job of conitnuing to develop characters and integrate the storylines into the social and political issues of the day.  The show continues to surprise.  Looking forward to season 6
B009GX69RK|5.0|Best comedy since Friends. Good timing. Excellent outside characters. Love the bar setting. And the eventual hook ups bound to happen slowly but the chemistry was definitely was there.<br /><br />Box came a little bruised but whatever all the disc worked just fine so I'll be able to continually watch it so I don't care.Won't give away the coupling but since I haven't been able to handle any comedy since Friends lately this is the one to try out.

B009RI4ZKC|1.0|Watched this with family, and among the six people watching, none of the group liked this movie.<br /><br />We watched for 30 minutes, only because the reviews were so good. We would have watched it for 10 minutes before turning it off had the reviews been honest.<br /><br />This movie is very slow, the plot isn't coherent and headlining actors have very minor roles. I'd consider them cameos really.<br /><br />This review will probably be down voted into oblivion, although I felt compelled to write this since the movie was so bad. I rarely or never write reviews.

0062112430|4.0|I can't put my finger on it but there was just something missing from this book that made it hard for me to love it. It didn't have that impossible to put down vibe for me, and most books I've read lately have done that for me. good story line, but extremely predictable in my opinion. I'd still recommend it, but its definitely not my favorite. the second book is significantly better, and written in a much different style which i liked a lot better. I couldn't put the second book down, which gives me hope for the third. also there is a LOT of swearing for a book that is supposed to be for young adults. if it were a movie, it would be rated R for the usage of the &#34;f&#34; word alone. Hope this helps.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I know it is strange to give this a 5 star rating and then say it was a let down. And that's just the way it is. Except for the delight of Anna and John Bates, the rest of the story was depressing, sad, and irritating. Incredibly well acted which is what makes it so good at being depressing, sad, and irritating. Once into the story though, you have to keep going. I guess I just hope they only produce one more season and bring it to a close.
0316228532|2.0|Like others, I wanted to see what the author of Harry Potter had to say in a whole new genre. I've gotten through 80-some pages of this 400 page novel, and--MY GOD!--when it's not being dull, it's just plain unpleasant and depressing. Most of the characters seem rather depressed, except the ones who are too arrogant and self-absorbed to be so.<br /><br />I suppose I'll try to get to the end of it, but other reviews suggest that it will be a tortuous slog clear to the final page.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Very unfortunate for them. I read this book in less than four hours because I couldn't put it down. This book is outstanding

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is great for me because I can find books that I couldn't any where else.  I find books for my tablet when I couldn't download it to.
0439882826|5.0|Bought this for my three year old grandson. He loves Star Wars and loves this book. Luckily he is careful with the pop ups. You would have to judge how careful a younger child would be with a book with all these pop ups. He is too young for the text, but gets hours of enjoyment telling his own stories as each page turns. A high quality product. Probably better for an older child, but, again it depends on the child and if you plan to enjoy it with him or her.
B004UID2LC|1.0|APP IS NOT GOOD AT ALL . USES ALL LOT OF SPACE.  DO NOT LIKE IT.  NOT WORTH 5 OR EVEN 1
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Absolutely love this product. Good quality. Love the fact that they do not touch the counter when cooking. If I have something that might drip, I put a paper towel under the tool. Planning to purchase a set for my daughters.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app.  Not only is it fun to watch; it is also useful in helping me figure out what things are the biggest drain on my battery.
B00BEU19ZU|2.0|It's too bad this app doesn't have a trial period. It would have saved me $0.99. All this app does is send you to the web pages of airports, airlines, and travel sites. Its flight search capabilities are not very comprehensive. My recommendation is to save your money and just search individual sites with your web browser.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its amazing! I can now fully understand the Bible. I like how the have built in audio. This app is amazing.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I usually don't write reviews but I was so mad that I wasted my time and money on this story I had to warn people.  Many people told me how wonderful this book was.  I liked the first two thirds of this book but the last one third was beyond belief.  I was left feeling angry after I was done.  The author writes well but the story goes off the rails.  It was like she gave up.  Please save your time and money. All the characters are unsympathetic and unbelievable in their actions.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Great to listen to no matter what your doing, driving, cleaning, reading...what ever the project may be it is a great album can't wait to get more.
0553801473|3.0|I loved the first three novels in the series.  They moved the story along.  The fourth and fifth books had too many characters and too many meandering plots.  I wish they had combined the fourth and fifth books and edited it down.  Many of the plot points for the both books could have been said in a few paragraphs instead of chapter with points of view from random characters. The books are well written but overly long.  I am still looking forward to the next book but I hope he moves the story along and sticks to some of the main characters.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Excellent modern adaptation.  Strange, witty, and never boring.  Certainly worth the time.  Tries to be a little too clever at times and doesn't give the viewer much of a chance at solving the puzzles--unlike the original stories.  Still, high-quality mystery with a very modern feel.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I'm a big Tegan and Sara fan I own pretty much all the albums. This one is a great one, of my favorites! My only draw back to the cd is it didn't contain the bonus tracks but the tracks came with the amazon auto rip feature so I was happy...Needed the extra songs!!! I highly recommend this album for any T&S fan... And if you never heard their music... Definitely give them a go!! I started off just enjoying the music but I became a huge Fan...They are Amazing artist!!
B007UXSKMU|4.0|I like this movie. It's a great action movie and keep you on your toes. I wanted to know what was good to happen next. Tom Cruise makes great movies. A great get togather movie with the family.

B007FIY3VW|4.0|I got this app on my kindle. Its great except I really wish that i could do power points on it. Anyways i was really excited cause my friend got Pages on her ipad and now i finally found something just like it for my kindle.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really liked the book. The emphasis on genetics, as well as the differences in the parental approaches made it compelling and credible. An enjoyable and provocative read.
B0000046KM|5.0|I truly love what Ms. Horn has done with each song on this cd!<br />I listen to it over and over.<br />The background music is soothing and beautiful.<br />Her arrangements are perfect in every way.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Krall is notat her best and her choice of tunes seems out of synch with her earlier discs. Too bad.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Took a while to get into the narrative flow. But the family dynamic, the football fandom, the Philly references, the bargaining prayer, the romantic loss, the mental illness and the unrelenting optimism struck a deep chord for me. Completely different tone that the film, for those who are looking for a comparison. A quick, highly enjoyable read.
B0012NVGHU|3.0|The music was excellent but it dominated the movie.  There was not much in the way of dialogue and the male lead seems like more of a musician than an actor. The female lead carried both off well. We had heard raves about the Broadway show but after watching the movie, are not sure why. We expected to see some sort of magical encounter and perhaps the music was that, but the relationship was not. Happy endings for each of them but not together.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I am all aglow with sheer festive delight, the aftermath of reading Robin Sloan' s wonderfully imaginative tale. A story of a secret society, lost books of hidden knowledge, and a frantic race to decode the secrets contained within using cutting edge software, is seductive, smart, and beguiling. I highly recommend this novel to all those who savor the allure of a wonderful reading experience.
0762434279|5.0|i got this book by error actually i wanted the full  sized version. but i read this one and the author was reader friendly. finance is a very boring subject but i was hooked in this mini version. no at all bored.  i brought the bigger book! shipping was fast and the company helped me with the minor misunderstanding i had.
B00BF2UKDE|4.0|It's not a bad album and it succeeds in ways that I feel Dig Lazarus Dig didn't.  I know I may be alone in saying that and that's cool.  I think it all comes down to expectations.  I understand that an artist isn't confined by my preconceived notions of the sorts of music that I think they should make.. I just wish that our tastes had stayed similar a bit longer :)<br /><br />UPDATED:<br />13 Apr 13<br /><br />So I've been giving this album some more rotation in my lineup and, I have to say, it's really grown on me. However, I didn't really begin to enjoy it until I cut one song out. I skip \\"The Water's Edge\\" every single time now. That song, for me, brings the entire album down. Once I stopped listening to it the rest of the music really came together for me. Upgraded from 3 to 4 stars
B005HSG3U6|3.0|This case is good at protecting my kindle from bumps and scratches, without adding to much bulk or weight. However I find it hard to get it to stay standing up, the groove that the flap should stick into to make it stand up doesn't seem quite deep enough or something. Luckily I don't need to use the stand much, so it's not a big deal.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the story, characters, settings, wardrobe... everything! Most important is I love that it's a show I very much enjoy and can watch with my children in the room. So many tv shows these days are not for childrens eyes or ears.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have never felt so connected to fictional characters in my life.  When a main character passes away I find myself mourning for them and I have to &#34;shake myself&#34; menatally and say &#34;these are only fictional characters . . . they just won't be there next season.  They are NOT really gone . .&#34;  That is how powerful this series is and that is how perfectly convincing the actors are!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Recommended by a friend.  She loved it and told me it was going to be released soon as a movie.  I think I'd enjoy the movie more than the book.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|It may be a good movie, I will never know.  I tried to get into the book at least 8 times and failed.  So much so, that I gave up.  It may be just me, but the style of writing and the storyline was boring and did not grab my attention in the slightest.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|My wife and I really liked this movie.  I liked the special effects, Bruce Willis, and my wife liked the fact that the time travel theme didn't confuse the heck out of her!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Everything about his movie was great.  It was engaging and it touched every emotion. I highly recommend this movie and will watch it again.
B00005JLKN|4.0|I've never seen Manhunter all the way through and some people say they prefer that version of the same story, but I totally understand why they remade this one with Anthony Hopkins returning to the role of Hannibal Lector.  He get a bit more screen time in this film than he did in The Silence of the Lambs, and they delve a little more into his back story which I am sure you are probably interested if you enjoyed the other film.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes plays a very disturbed man who his battling his inner demons and only starts to show some humanity when he befriends a blind co-worker.  It's a very different type of villian than Lector or Jame Gumb from the other film.  They do attempt to explain his back story, but I felt that was somewhat unnecessary because it seems that they're trying to justify his behavior.  Some things are better left to the imagination.<br /><br />The only real problem I have with this movie is that they have Harvey Kietel playing FBI Director Jack Crawford after Scott Glenn played him masterfully in The Silence of the Lambs.  I generally like Kietel but it seems he was really miscast in this film.  He didn't seem to be Will Graham's boss as much as his confidant.  It just didn't work for me.<br /><br />Update: From what I've read, Scott Glen was offered the role of Jack Crawford but found the story (and the Silence of the Lambs) too disturbing and declined.  Too bad.  This film would have been better with him in it.
B00AI5AQPQ|4.0|It was a lot different from the movie which really confused me because I love the movie and I have sen it almost 15000 times and i can memorize almost every line. I still did enjoy the book though!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Excellent very well written and a very quick read a fine book that all ages can enjoy for years to come
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|When you watch the previews, you get the impression that this film will be quite a bit of comedy. And as I really like Tommy Lee Jones, I was looking forward to that. Unfortunately, not so much. Although it does have a few humorous moments, it is really more about the deeper marital issues that a long time married couple is facing. I think the movie is done well, the actors are great together and the story is touching. Not the laugh's I was hoping for but it certainly tugs at the heart.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I love it, wish i could find a cool castle in the middle of nowhere :D oh, and I &#60;3 Mavis!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|dont watch it with the lights out!and it seems like its gonna be a part 2 but if not! its  worth checking out! one of the better horror movies ive seen in recent memory !

B0068LYEHA|5.0|I love every God damn word. and you should definitely read it for yourselves! strident feminists unite! Damon the patriarchy!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It was a good read. Not spectacular, but the ironic twist at the end made it  good. An easy, light read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Este juego es sumamente estretenido... mi hijo de 4 años lo juega conmigo y le ayuda mucho a desarrollar destrezas. Recomendado.
1600108512|3.0|I was really keen to get a hardback version of this beautiful story for my daughter. I didn't notice (in the tiny fine print) that this is the graphic novel version. Yes it is beautifully bound and illustrated, just not what I was after, which I have since found and purchased separately.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I'm kind of disappointed, I would give more stars if it has closed caption available, since I am hard of hearing.
B007D5E7C2|4.0|I bought this movie because Ive seen it a million times yet never owned either of them. DVD plays, good times.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't stop reading until I had finished it, but it was a downer.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't already depraved.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Very sad story and kept me guessing to the end. Great read. I will read .more from this author. Good live story.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|As a longtime batman fan,I really enjoyed it.Great story that even non batman fans can enjoy.Makes you think about yourself when you get older.The underlying story is very entertaining and will keep you entertained.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great movie but it would have been better if I could have streamed it to my tv from mt iPad.  When I tried it said hdmi was not available with the amazon app.  Looks like I'll be using iTunes until they change that feature.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|A must see for ERB fans and fans of Scifi in general. One of those movies you can watch again and again.
0525478817|5.0|Love this book, love the author, love that is has been in the NY Best Sellers list for over a year!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|At first I was skeptical as there seemed to be too many odd names and characters, I decided to continue and I'm glad I did. The story became more and more FANTASTICAL! Great read, can't wait for 2nd and 3rd...
B004I744AS|5.0|A great and useful app. I am learning constantly from the different sections available to use.Cant believe rhese kinds of tools are free.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book brings so many emotions over you as a reader,<br /> and I loved it! I really could not put this book down. I recommend this book and give it 5 stars!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|cheapest location to watch the beginning of season. i watched season 1 and 2 on netflix and got hooked and could not wait for the current season to get to netflix.<br />it's an addicting show.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Part 2 was even better than part 1! Amazing art and story telling. The only things I miss are Batman's internal monologue from the books and I'd prefer the voice of Kevin Conroy. All in all one of the best Batman animated movies ever! The battle with Superman was epic!
B00008IHN1|5.0|Bought DVD for 3 and 4 year grandsons after buying them each a drum set.  They watch the DVD about 4 times in one day through the week.  Probably will have to replace DVD next year from so much use.  Great Buy!!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best mini series to come from the uk since upstairs downstairs.  it is a pleasure to have and will provide hours of entertainment in the years to come.<br /> i would recomend it to anyone who enjoys British hiatory.
B005HEPQ9O|5.0|Star Trek: TNG is a classic sci-fi TV show, with Season 2 continuing the saga of the Enterprise.<br /><br />The show does incredibly well with:<br />* Interesting plots.<br />* Interesting aliens and characters.<br />* Interesting crew interactions.<br /><br />The show hasn't quite gotten up to par yet with:<br />* Some of the acting.<br />* Some of the graphics.<br /><br />I remember starting to watch this show as a kid, and I've really enjoyed getting back into it as an adult.<br /><br />If you're a sci-fi fan or a Star Trek fan, definitely give this show a shot!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I saw this group featured on an episode of bar rescue. I haven't bought a complete cd in years but this one was great from start to finish.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Some of the episodes didn't have the greatest clear quality but still it was still good to see the episode.
B00846REIS|5.0|Scorching, red hot and surpasses all my expectations.  I have no problems reading what a lot of my readers call &#34;mommy porn&#34;.  Most of it is what I call romance with a little spice.  When I want harder and edgier, I read things like 10 Nights by Michelle Hughes and Karl Jones.  I honestly thought that was what I was getting when I delved into the world of Gideon Cross.  Boy, was I wrong...<br /><br />Eva knew from the moment that she sprawled on her ass in front of Gideon Cross that there was something dangerous about him.  Passion and intensity were etched into him like part of his DNA.  It sang and called to her on an intimate level that was hotter then anything she had ever known.<br /><br />Self-preservation tells her to stay far away from him because she knows that she is asking for trouble.  Gideon knows what he wants and as a very successful billionaire, he has no trouble getting it.  As a very controlling man, he finds it nearly impossible to give up control but for her he is willing to try.<br /><br />This is so different from the other stories about virgins jumping into domination games with rich men.  This story shows two very flawed souls struggling to come together against all odds.  Eva has been devestated and brutalized and needs the control that Gideon can give her but she is scared to let him close.  Gideon needs the soothing balm that Eva can provide but can't release the iron grip he has on his emotions.  These two don't have a smooth ride and I am glad to see a story that has some real edge to it and issues that people face on a normal day in relationships.<br /><br />Ms. Day has managed to create a story that reaches in and rips out all your predetermined ideas and piece them back together into a raw love story that will leave you craving more.<br /><br />This book was purchased by the reviewer.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I thought the book was very good. Like the first book, there were so many twists that I had a hard time putting it down.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I don't even know how to begin with this review.  I have just finished this book and I am sitting here with tears in my eyes, brought to an ending that I never saw coming.  What would you be willing to do for your obsession?  At what point do you realize that your obsession is slowly destroying who and what you are?  Eva knows that the path that she and Gideon are traveling is a dangerous one and doesn't know what to do about it.  She needs him like the air she breaths.<br /><br />The past never stays buried.  It has  a way of crawling out of the gutters and slithering across all that you have managed to achieve since burying it.  Gideon and Eva have such pasts and the way they both try to handle them is heartbreaking and shattering.<br /><br />Eva can't trust what she doesn't understand and feels the need to punish Gideon for the pain that she feels at times.  Gideon can't seem to open up to Eva and that is devastating to her.<br /><br />At what point do you take matters into your own hands to save what has become the only thing in the world that means anything at all to you?  I can not wait to read the next in this poignant and painfully beautiful series.<br /><br />This book was purchased by the reviewer.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I love this thing. For $20, it's a great accessory.<br /><br />I've used it to hang my camera from cross beams, put my camera on sand (without worrying about getting sand in the camera), put my camera down on a boat without worrying that it's going to slide or topple over, put my camera on a car's dashboard without worrying about it slipping, and generally used it to stabilize my shots.<br /><br />No, it's not perfect. The plastic can flex... if you have big meaty hands and try to do pushups on it. The screw could be longer, but I didn't have a problem. And it's tough to mount a tripod's quick-release had to it (that was the most frustrating, I wanted to keep my camera mounted on the grip, but occasionally use the tripod, without having to unscrew it... but the space between the feet isn't quite large enough, making mounting on the tripod difficult).<br /><br />But as a whole, my Canon Vixia HF G10 couldn't have been happier on the X-Grip.<br /><br />ADDED BONUS for the G10: If you have the G10 and use it with the extra-length BP827 battery, the grip provides extra support for the battery. The battery is very long and hangs off the back of the camera, and has a tendency to rattle ever so slightly. By mounting the camera on the X-Grip, the battery has a little bit of extra support and removes the rattle. Nice!
B00B2QA646|2.0|NOT AT ALL LIKE PREVIOUS VERSIONS, WOULDN'T RECOMMEND SPENDING MONEY ON THIS VERSION, ALTHOUGH ACTING WAS WELL DONE, I DIDN'T CARE FOR SETTINGS, DISTRACTED FROM THE GOOD ACTING
B000FCKC4C|2.0|A fable that attributes much of what happens to &#34;fate&#34; and belief in a supreme being.  Not bothering to search for reasons or  causes of events.  It is a mystical fairy tale.  Such books perpetuate ignorance and blind faith in an unknown spirit.  It does not compare to phisophical books such as THE PROPHET by Kahlil Gibran.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to identify with the characters and get inside what they were going thru.
B006QPX7UI|4.0|Good movie; appeared to be shot on location.  Story was not as good as its prequel, Gods and Generals.  Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee was not very sympathetic, but from what I've read, it may be accurate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book almost as good as the first one! Can't wait for the movie. Next up mockingjay!!! Awesome books
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have never read a Nicolas Sparks book before this and I'm so glad this was my first choice.  This book kept me awake until wee hours of the night/morning.  Absolutely amazing! !!
1936608898|5.0|This is a wonderful, life-changing book.  I've been a believer in the \\"It's Starts with Food\\" lifestyle for a couple years now and it has changed my life for the better, all the while trying to convince my mom, who has struggled with many of my same issues and has seen my incredible progress, that she could also be successful.  I gave her this book to read and she is finally on-board!  She has lost weight and many of the issues that were making her feel so terrible, joint pain, extreme fatigue, etc., were cleared after following the \\"It Starts With Food Program.\\"  I will forever be thankful to the authors for making this wonderful book!
1577312082|5.0|I read this book out of extreme desperation. More precisely, I started to read, then bought the CDs, and have listened to them over and over. I felt hopelessly trapped between a rock and a hard place, my understanding of my world was failing me. The information presented has been a game changer for me. I now understand and have experienced a way out of the trap and into the life of promise I have always believed was possible.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh at his Analog Best! You can't go wrong with this one! Welcome back Joe! Can't wait to hear it live!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very well done game! The only drawback is you need real money to pay for some in game stuff.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The way the plot is structured is superb! two stories that are described: a main character in the past and the main character of the present who wants to unveil that  terrible past. The story is cleverly written and it is going to move the reader to the bones!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This product was very fun I'm still trying to get at least 76'000 money<br />To get a new person so could I get some for free
B008602KQI|5.0|After reading the book, I was very much interested in watching the film based on the novel. I have to say I was very pleased in the way the producers depicted this fantasy arena especially how the \\"show\\" was being captured. This took some getting used to when I was reading the book. I kept having to remind myself that the whole world was watching. And the movie put it all into perspective.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|My 85 year old mom, my 50yr old sister & I (55) really enjoyed watching this movie. It is a keeper. Love Maggie Smith!<br />The acting was lovely, story line is touching. Loved the sets and costumes. I would love to see more movies similar to this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I never thought that I would be into a show on PBS but I am hooked and can't get enough of it. It's like a tv version of Gosford Park.
0553057006|5.0|Even parents with the &#34;best intentions&#34; make mistakes that can stay with a child through their adult years and have a lasting and negative effect on  the adults child's future relationships.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey takes me to another world. The acting is first rate as are the story and plot.<br />The writer knows his subject and his characters. I love that the story comes from the environment and the characters' values.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|A movie to see again and enjoy. The actors, music and dance are wonderful. The plot is trite but who cares in this delightful musical.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|This book is a must read for every person in critical professions. As author acknowledges human fallibilities he emphasizes the systems that allow us to carry critical tasks with more precision, probably saving lives as a result.<br />And he talks about checklists, of course!
B000002JSN|5.0|I'm trying to imagine what Led Zeppelin's fifth album, Houses of the Holy, would have been like if they would have included the title song instead of say \\"The Crunge.\\"  Let's say they did - what an album that would have been!!  It would have been even greater than it already is.<br /><br />Then they were facing putting out a 6th album.  Many have said that Led Zep should have only put out a single album instead of the double disc that they did.  But if you do that then what songs do you include?  Realizing that one has at most about 22-23 minutes on a side of a vinyl album, I would have issued something like this:<br /><br />Side 1 (20:39)<br />Custard Pie 4:20<br />The Rover 5:44<br />Bron-Yr-Aur 2:07<br />Kashmir 8:28<br /><br />Side 2 (21:13)<br />The Wanton Song 4:10<br />Black Country Woman 4:30<br />Trampled Under Foot 5:38<br />Ten Years Gone 6:55<br /><br />Now this would have been a real kick ass album (!) and probably should have been the first LP when it was first released - the original tracking order on this album stunk.<br /><br />But wait, then you still have some pretty passable songs in \\"Night Flight (3:37)\\", \\"Boogie With Stu (3:45)\\", \\"Sick Again (4:40)\\" and \\"In The Light (8:46).\\"  These 4 together make up about 21 minutes which would make up another side of a vinyl LP (although I believe \\"In the Light\\" would have been much better as about at 6 minutes with some of the intro synthesizer work shortened).  Plus, you still have the great \\"Houses of the Holy (4:01)\\" which was left off of the fifth album.<br /><br />Bottom line is there are really only two stinkers on the album - \\"In My Time of Dying (11:08)\\" and \\"Down by the Seaside (5:15)\\".  Unfortunately \\"Dying\\" is found on the first side of the first vinyl record so I remember back in `75 that it kind of hurt the mood going in to the rest of the album.  And \\"Seaside\\" was on side 3.  Both of these really should have been put on side 4 with maybe Sick Again or Night Flight.<br /><br />So, yes one albumwould have worked better, but I really like 3 sides worth of this album, so I'm glad they went with a double album.  I frankly don't care if there are a few songs I don't like.  I don't like a few songs on the Beatle's White album, the Stones' Exile and the Who's Quadrophenia either.  But for those that say the only good song on this album was Kashmir, well go back and listen to whatever it is you listen to - you really don't need Led Zeppelin.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Every one need to see this film a eye opener. I also highly recommend a movie called The Future of Food.
B002QAY31Y|5.0|I hadn't seen this series for more than thirty years and it is as wonderful as the memories I had.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game to pass a little time I play all the time. Would recommend to anyone. Great great great great
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Kept me wondering what would happen next.  Hope these characters come around again.  Easy to read this book and entertaining.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Awesome! It would be better if I had the kindle hd and could use the camera as a light too but it's still great for a free app
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. It's better than the first hunger games book..... Can't wait to read Mocking Jay. I hope its better than this one
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I picked this up because it's become very big in pop culture recently. Unfortunately it's awkwardly written, sexist rubbish. There is clearly a big market out there for mainstream erotic fiction; but I wonder why this is the book that's taken off.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|cool i love the game it has made me in love it is a great game very adicting to play<br />l
B0079LSJ6A|4.0|This is a great introduction to discussion around sex differences in the brain. Fine writes in a way that is very accessible to the lay reader
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Phantom was the last book in the Nesbo series and was one of his best...I enjoyed them all!  I believe Nesbo's books are actually somewhat better than Steig Larrson.  Henning Mankell is also great amongst the European writers and I've read all the books by all of these three
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its kills time when im bored its fun when u get to own multiple horses beat competitions and bread horses
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|One of the better free mahjong apps, and fun sound effects! Great way to waste a lot of time or just a little.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a great game couldnt put it down until i finnished it. Great effects and like how you had the hint button to give you a helping hand
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was captivating the whole time. I could not put it down. There was so many surprising events that I was not expecting at all. It left me wanting more.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Excelente compra.<br /><br />El reloj llego en perfectas condiciones, le he dado uso diario y no presenta fallas. Los cronometros funcionan a la perfeccion y el proveedor fue muy cumplido en los tiempos de entrega.<br /><br />Quisiera ver que otros relojes tiene para comprar.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />Excellent purchase.<br /><br />The watch arrived in perfect condition, I gave daily use and has no flaws. The timers work perfectly and was very satisfied in supplier delivery times.<br /><br />I would like to see other clocks have to buy, Im from Colombia.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! It helps so no matter where you have been ans lived through you can always find happiness.
B005CFVSYK|5.0|I bought this sandal in desperation.<br />I had a lot of walking to do on a trip and my feet hurt so bad I was forced to stay home a whole day because I couldn't walk! I also couldn't wear closed shoes.<br />Crocs really are the ultimate in footwear.<br />The straps on this sandal are snug so if you have wide feet, watch out.<br />The Dahlia/Fuscia sandal is a lovely color. I bought a size 7M (I'm usually a US 7.5/UK 5.5/India 38) and it is just perfect (perhaps because it's an open toe style). I have two other (both different) open toe models in Crocs and I wear those in a 7M as well.<br />Despite the heel, it cushioned my feet to the point where I was more comfortable in the sandal than bare foot.<br />And I cannot believe how many compliments I got on this sandal! :D<br />I think of Crocs as very casual footwear, and although I'm a big fan, I don't think they're anything to write home about looks-wise (even though I LOVE the colors). However, after I got the 3rd compliment on this particular model, I now look at it in a new light. And I've gotten more compliments since then.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Would like to give zero stars as Mathew was killed off and he was my favorite, but it is a really show.
1449433251|5.0|My 9-year-old son bought this with all the money he saved from Christmas gifts.  He loves it, and won't be more than a few feet from it at any time.  Given the amount of punishment his books can go through, the binding on these books is solid, though, being paperbacks, they are showing some wear and tear.  I imagine most people buying these books will be adults, so I have to mention that the color is bright, the linework is crisp, and you have more Calvin and Hobbes to pore over than even the most dedicated reader could get through in a week.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It made me feel, like I was right there inside the book, watching everything that was going on.......Great story<br />I recommend it to all the Pendergast fans
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very much like A&E's Pride & Predjudice Supeb Very Histrically accurate  You should watch it,  A must see TV show
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Good movie,the alien baby was kind of crazy,but overall it was a good movie,I also liked the ending,now we know how Alien began.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Many twists in the story.  A very emjoyable and time worthy.  A must see do not miss it.  Many that I know are equally attatched to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cute game .. free... makes time go bye fast. Lots of fun and easy to play. Fun for kids and adults.
B004OZZ624|3.0|The premise is good, and the cast excellent.  Apparently, the producers forgot that there is an editing studio.  No way that movie should have been over 2 hrs.  It is also  somewhat startling to see the naive teacher morph from the victim of a scam, to the bumbler who breaks off a key, to the stud who breaks into the meth lab to rob the dealers.  Probably would never have thought twice about any of that, except there was all that down time which gave me time to think about these pesky little details.<br /><br />still, it's an OK flick...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a very complex game with some kind of stunt devil that is trying to get through a bunch of obstacles
0920668372|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has a connection  with a busy little boy.  This book gave me hope.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show. It is both entertaining and historical. Other networks should take a lesson from it and get rid of all that junk tv. Downton Abbey rocks!!!!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|My old 3 disc CD was scratched up, so I decided to replace it, but I found this one and replaced it with this instead. This had most of my favorites on the first CD!
B00136Q342|5.0|Seriously, if you only buy one Johnny Cash album in your entire life, and I cannot imagine such a dreadful fate, this is THE ONE.  Cash's career was ebbing when this was recorded and despite his label's lack of enthusiasm for promoting the album, this was the turnaround that not only sent his career upward but outward as well.  When &#34;Folsom&#34; came out the Man in Black sound crossed boundaries sending Cash on to musical icon status.  As if Johnny wouldn't be enough, as bonus you get: June Carter, Carl Perkins, The Statler Brothers and joining in.<br /><br />OK.  Don't buy this.  Go ahead and spend the rest of your life wondering what might have been.  Or do buy the album and get yourself just a little closer to self-actualization.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I must've been late to the party, but when I began playing this, I COULD NOT STOP! Very enjoyable, but it does get quite boring after awhile.
