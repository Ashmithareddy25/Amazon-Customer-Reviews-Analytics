B00000258P|5.0|a album that has the misfortune of coming between 2 classics. wish you were here and the wall can get overlooked easily. every floyd fan should check this out your doing yourself an injustice by not. this is a very good record.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow!! This dvd is very intense. I've only done the first stage and I've been on it for a couple of weeks. I think I'm ready to move to the next level. I recently had a baby and going to a gym is not an option right now. This is a perfect workout for the busy-bee that needs physical activity in a short amount of time. Believe me, you are not missing out on anything just because it's a short workout. You will be sweating and you're heart will be racing by the end.
B000O77RLE|3.0|I am Japanese and although the movie was entertaining...it did not in any way depict how Japanese soldiers actually fought.  The Samurai or Bushido spirit was notably absent - the scenes of suicide by grenades were done terribly.  Japanese Soldiers were among the fiercest ever witnessed in battle - they fought to the death and rarely ever surrenderred.   Japanese Soldiers were hardcore assasin's and this movie did not do justice showing that.  Movies like Tora Tora Tora, FArewell to Manzanar and the Japanese Movie Yamato are more true to how the Japanese Soldier thought and acted than this movie by Eastwood - it was a good try but was not an accurate portrayal....
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I reeks that it was so short.. I was overseas when the show premiered so never got a chance to watch it when it originally aired.. I got a glimpse of it once though and it didn't impress me so I didn't explore it further (at this point I had already watched the original Star Trek, Star Trek The Next Generation, a lot of Star Trek Deep Space Nine (not too fond of that one), and Star Trek Voyager and why it didn't catch my attention I'll never know) fast forward to 2009 and it comes out on Sci-Fi and decided to give it a shot.... I set the DVR to record so I could watch it later to see if I'd like it and I couldn't get enough of it!! First chance my wallet got I bought the whole series mostly unseen.. I was that taken and impressed by it.. I really was.. I'm not usually so impulsive.. I love it!! I love it!! I love it!! Voyager used to be my favorite (for sentimental reasons) but now it's hands down Enterprise..<br /><br />I will warn you about one thing though.. the way it was ended was criminal and sloppy.. I'm sure all the reasons are there.. blah, blah, blah.. but it was truly devestating.. what a horrid end to a excellent Star Trek..<br /><br />Oh yeah.. and for the record.. my 13 and 16-year old daughters got sucked into it kicking and screaming but they love it now too.. he he. (the big debate is who is hotter.. Tucker from Enterprise or Riker from The Next Generation.. lol.. I have a personal fondness for Captain Archer.. who knew.. )

B000AS4L16|5.0|A South Korean production DVD doco is an impressive classic work of a world history.<br /><br />It is definitely not an entertaining film but educative, witnessing the developing of \\"civilised\\" anti-Semitism.<br /><br />To a viewer's strong opinion, screening its exserts either as a part of studying or just for broadening mind, fifteen minutes daily at home, would prevent young people, in a particular case, the European pupils from a deep shock as it was noticed in the Auschwitz Museum at the end of their in-fly international excursion to Auschwitz, the former concentration camp near Oswiencim, Poland.<br /><br />Regrettably to the Holocaust deniers - de-facto terrorist supporters, Auschwitz as the Museum is still existing and attracting tourists from round a globe.
0316017922|4.0|I found this book to be very interesting. The author analyzes several situations where many people might take for granted how many things had to happen at exactly the right time in order for everything to come together. I found one of the most interesting parts of the book to be part that talks about the 10,000 hours of practice. I had never heard of that previously and to me it makes a great deal of sense. I'd say it's a great read overall and it will give you a new perspective on things in life.
B001N3OCV6|4.0|I enjoyed the soundtrack to WATCHMEN. I thought the songs in the film were almost perfect for the scenes they accompanied. Taken away from the movie, the songs on the soundtrack seem like a mumble-jumble, very hetic mess of music. There are several different styles of music from several different eras. It's a very wide range. However, even outside the context of the movie, most of the songs are excellent on their own. I especially liked \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" by Bob Dylan. This song is the song used underneath the opening montage of the film. I had never heard the song before and thought it was perfect for that montage. Other songs on the album I enjoy include:<br /><br />\\"Desolation Row\\"--My Chemical Romance<br /><br />\\"Unforgettable\\"--Nat King Cole<br /><br />\\"Pruit Igoe & Prophecies\\"--The Philip Glass Ensemble<br /><br />\\"Hallelujah\\"--Leonard Cohen<br /><br />\\"All Along the Watchtower\\"--Jimi Hendrix<br /><br />Despite the great music on the album, the WATCHMEN SOUNDTRACK is not a complete soundtrack. There are at least two glaring omissions: \\"99 Luftballoons\\" by Nena and \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" by Muzak. A soundtrack is supposed to include all of the non-instrumental music from a movie. These are two songs (and I believe there was probably one or two) really strengthened the scenes they supported and should have been included on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoy this soundtrack, but am disappointed that it isn't a complete soundtrack. I'd give this five stars for the music, but since it's not a complete soundtrack, I've got to deduct a star.
0525951113|5.0|Daemon by Daniel Suarez is an incredibly taunt, thrill-a-minute high-tech novel! Most would expect a first-time author to make a few stumbles, but Suarez has written a compelling, cautionary tale that simply demands a sequel!<br /><br />Matthew Sobol is dead. A brilliant game designer, loaded with cash and tons of anger, Sobol has unleashed a deadly game on an unwitting humanity. His death triggers a cascade of events that neither man, nor machine, can seem to stop, culminating in a worldwide meltdown of finances, networks, and at its very core, human decency. Only a few \\"good guys\\" seem to have the wherewithal to derail his plan for making the future in his image, and even then, the good guys are barely hanging as Sobol's plan seems to be one step ahead each time.<br /><br />With today's very real fears of identity theft, cybercrime, and computer networks that seemingly run amok with the simplest of virus attacks, Daemon is a cautionary tale for what lies ahead of us. Don't miss this techno-thriller!
B001QB9H1K|5.0|Lite Transporter flick has a Bond feel in the soundtrack and it's spice. It's a Besson film  with all the usual stuff. In the mood, you'll find this a great fun-action film. Luc Besson always gives you style over substance for better or worrse. He doesn't direct anymore but his stamp is on all his entertaining films.  This is reference Quality A/V. The Blu-ray is gorgeous with incredible sound. It helps the film since it is candy!
B001KQ4KCW|5.0|I didn't know this was written as a child's book until I got it home.  Once I started it, I didn't put it down until I was finished, which only took a few hours.  The story's end shocked me.  It moved me so that I retold the story to my knitting group that meets in a convent of all places.  Everyone listened without interruption and all were deeply moved. This is an easy read and has a great moral lesson.  I bought the movie also but haven't had the heart to watch the horror about which I had just read brought to life through cinematography.
0060899220|4.0|My credentials for reviewing \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" are these: I cook, I eat out at restaurants, I watch and savor \\"No Reservations\\" on the Travel Channel, I think whoever developed Food Network is a genius.<br /><br />There's something intoxicating about all the food being prepared on television, from \\"Top Chef\\" to \\"Iron Chef,\\" from staid PBS cooking shows to Guy Fieri's endless road tripping on the Triple D.<br /><br />I watched about twenty episodes of \\"No Reservations\\" before I picked up \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" so it was easy to hear Bourdain's voice as the memoir flowed.<br /><br />Among all of the food personalities out there---Flay, Battali, Fieri, Brown, DeLaurentis, Ray, Oliver, on an on---Tony is the best. Why? He's got demons. He's wry, occasionally bitter, sardonic, witty and just wants to enjoy life. It's about the food, but it's also about the moments that food creates. He's willing to try almost anything. Almost. But it isn't just the food. It's the people.<br /><br />OK, it's also cool that he references The Ramones and The Cramps. He's a rocker.<br /><br />\\"Kitchen Confidential\\" shows you the roots of some of the demons Bourdain references on \\"No Reservations.\\"  He's a warts-and-all guy. The shooting galleries and self-loathing are all in the book--the highs and lows of the food biz.  The book starts strong and loses some of its focus with some of the more slice-and-dice minor essays, but anybody who is thinking about opening a restaurant will want to spend the few hours it takes to read the whole thing, particularly the parts about ordering food, cooking food, hiring staff, firing staff, poaching staff (from other restaurants) and all many other aspects of running an eating establishment. (News flash: it isn't just about the recipes and the quality of the food.)<br /><br />\\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is driven by that colorful Bourdain voice and endless cheerleading for the new next big thing in flavor.<br /><br />\\"Do all these horrifying assertions frighten you? Should you stop eating out? Wipe yourself down with antiseptic towelettes every time you pass a restaurant? No way. Like I said before, your body is not a temple, it's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride. Sure, it's a \\"play you pay\\" sort of an adventure, but you knew that already, every time you ever ordered a taco or dirty-water hot dog. If you're willing to risk some slight lower GI distress for one of those Italian sweet sausages at the street fair, or for a slice of pizza you just know has been sitting on the board for an hour or two, why not take a chance on the good stuff? All the great developments of classical cuisine, the first guys to eat sweetbreads, to try unpasteurized Stilton, to discover what snails actually taste good with enough garlic butter, these were daredevils, innovators and desperados.\\"<br /><br />I'd say Anthony Bourdain is pretty much all three.down with antiseptic towelettes every time you pass a restaurant?

B000M5AJQS|5.0|Martin Scorsese finally took home his first Academy Award for Best Director for \\"The Departed\\". With consummate skill he assembled bewilderingly complex and varied ingredients: performers, story, settings, photography - with the result being a film that grabs your attention in the first few moments and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The film clocks in at a minute less than 2 1/2 hours. With about 10 minutes left the Mrs. and I shared that we both needed a bathroom break after our half-gallon sodas... but neither of us dared leave.<br /><br />The screenplay, I learn, was adapted by William Monahan from a Hong Kong script by Siu Fai Mak which was translated into English as \\"Internal Affairs\\". I also read that Mr. Scorsese didn't see the Chinese film but, rather, worked from an English translation of the \\"Internal Affairs\\" script. The story is a compelling narrative. Mr. Monahan has adapted the story to a Boston setting of Irish cops and gangsters. The dialog is full of sharp, witty one-liners, but also with a realistic, gritty ring of truth. The language reflects the setting of South Boston, not Sesame Street, so if your ears burn with the constant use of profanity - you may want to wait for an \\"edited for TV\\" version.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a sizzling performance as a Boston \\"Southie\\" who joins the police force at a tender age, but because of his family (his father was a local tough guy and his uncle a low level mobster)and intelligence(we're told he scored 1400 on his SAT - not usual police recruit material) he is recruited by a secret undercover unit to infiltrate the local mafia. We see him put through a grueling interview by his to-be superiors, Martin Sheen, full of paternal wisdom, and Mark Wahlberg, full of suspicions and vulgarities (but with many of the movie's best moments in a role that is no higher than maybe 5th or 6th billing.) At the same time DiCaprio is being recruited to infiltrate the mob, Matt Damon has been sent by the same mob to join the police force where, with his intelligence, etc, he is soon in a parallel secret unit investigating both his boss, Irish Mobster Frank Costello (in yet another defining performance by Jack Nicholson) and the \\"mole\\" who it is apparent has infiltrated the police force. (Among the many fine scenes are one where Damon gets to inform Nicholson that he is now leading the investigation to find - himself.)<br /><br />Jack's performance is a Nicholson special. Frank Costello is a nearly untouchable sociopath. (The reason Costello is \\"ungettable\\" by the Massachusetts police force is one of dozens of intricate twists and sub-plots.) Costello is vulgar and menacing and everyone in Boston quakes in his presence, from local priests to the scariest hit men. The Mrs. and I differ in our opinion of whether the film revolves around Costello (her view), since all the other characters revolve around him and, after all, he's played by the great Jack Nicholson, or whether DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the main character (my opinion), since he has the most screen time and, if this story has a protagonist, Costigan is it. It's enjoyable to discuss such things, but it's quibbling. \\"The Departed\\" has so many well-drawn characters breathed to life by stellar actors in brilliant performances that it could easily populate two *good* films!<br /><br />Vera Farmiga was previously unknown to me, but she delivers in the only major female role as a police psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, but takes the presumably lower-paying position because she wants to serve her community while she also helps her patients. In one of the trickiest roles of the film she becomes romantically attracted to both \\"moles\\", not knowing the \\"true identity\\" of either until the climax of the film. Her steely determination after she discovers that Matt Damon is the police department \\"rat\\" reminds me of Alida Valli's famous performance in \\"The Third Man\\" and her final scene in this movie (walking away from a funeral in a cemetery towards the camera in a single shot, completely ignoring the man who thinks he has romantic possibilities with her) is an obvious homage by Scorsese to Carol Reed's film classic.<br /><br />Ray Winstone (as Costello's right-hand man, \\"Frenchie\\") and Alec Baldwin (as the over-matched police detective who is trying to bring together the various machinations of the Boston detectives and undercover mob infiltrators) lead the next tier of supporting performances. It's just another sign of the overall quality of Mr. Scorsese's picture that actors who would \\"star\\" in other films take on roles that in other films would be fleshed out by unknowns.<br /><br />The plotting and timing are relentless. There are a half dozen scenes with more edge-of-your-seat white-knuckle tension than a hundred chainsaw and machete wielding madmen movies combined. DiCaprio's performance brings home the fear that the character must have constantly been feeling. If discovered, he would certainly be killed by Costello's mobsters in a way that would serve as an example. The film ends, I think, as it must, and it's fair to say it's a Noir ending and not a \\"Hollywood\\" ending. Over the weeks leading up to this year's Academy Awards this film will be praised more than the last 25 films nominated for \\"Best Picture\\" combined. All the praise and hoopla will make \\"The Departed\\" and it's various investors a lot of money. This makes me wonder - if great films like this are profitable, why bother with the other 99% of brainless dreck that shows up at my local cineplex every week?

B001FBSMF8|3.0|Wow, over 76 reviews a couple of days after release.  Like it or not, more people seem to be talking about this album than Carry On and the last two Audioslave albums put together.  The thing about this album is this... it's not supposed to be taken as anything other than an experimental side album that Chris released very quickly after his last album (and it was actually supposed to be out months ago),  Think \\"808's and Heartbreaks\\".  So taking it for what it is, I have to say that it's really not that bad.  Is \\"Carry On\\" honestly that much more listenable?  I know we all want the Chris Cornell that gave us \\"Sunshower\\" and \\"Euphoria Morning\\", but it's ten years later, the dude is mid 40's and there's a good chance it' not going to happen.  I honestly believe that time will tell with this album, and that it's either going to be recognized as a really cool under appreciated album of it's time, or a total mess that ruined Chris Cornell's already fading career.  We'll have to wait and see.      ***Side Note*** If you're looking for some classic Cornell on this album, check out the hidden track \\"Two Drinks Behind\\", which is a bluesy bar song that no fan can deny.  It's probably a good indication of the music Chris is working on for his next release.

1427206031|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has come up with an entertaining winner with his latest offering, [[ASIN:1427206031 Paths of Glory]]. The edition that I'm reviewing is on nine audio CDs, making up eleven hours of excellent narration by English actor Roger Allam. When offered a Vine choice between this or the [[ASIN:0312539517 hardcover version]], I broke personal tradition and opted for the CDs, and largely due to Roger Allam's excellent recitation, wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Mr. Archer is an author of whom it's been said prefers to be called a storyteller as opposed to a writer, though his skills in both excel. Have been reading his offerings since his first novel [[ASIN:0312997132 Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less]] (1976), when I became a fan of his stories.<br /><br />This is a tale of George Mallory, a novel based on history. The brief facts are this: Mallory was an English climber who participated in the first three British expeditions to Mount Everest in the early 1920s. On the third expedition in June 1924, Mallory and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine disappeared during or after completing the final stage of their attempt to make the first ascent of Everest, and their last known sighting was only a few hundred meters from the summit. Mallory's ultimate fate wasn't known for 75 years, when his body was finally discovered in 1999. It's been a subject of much speculation as to whether or not they reached the summit before they died.<br /><br />And it's in storytelling that Mr. Archer doesn't disappoint here, as he's taken his personal approach as he does best in telling the tale of Mallory. He takes you through a fictionalized tour of the climber's life, from the time that he tries to climb the Eiffel Tower as a schoolboy, only to be arrested when he's 100ft from the top. Late for his college interview at Cambridge, he finds the gates are locked. He climbs the wall, but the headmaster's garden lies on the other side, and at the time the Master is scrutinizing the flowerbeds. Mr. Archer delves into entertaining insights into Mallory's marriage and subsequent children, and his overseas lecture tour. In New York, the happily-married Mallory escapes the attentions of an overly affectionate heiress, and his only way out is by climbing out of a high window.<br /><br />In his characteristic fashion, Archer offers truly heart-stopping moments. While climbing in the Alps, two of Mallory's companions unexpectedly plunge past him, and he has only a brief second to twist the rope round his already-planted axe, getting ready to take the strain when the rope suddenly stretches tight. But it's how he details cliff hanger moments like these that make this story so riveting.<br /><br />Archer has an amazing way with words. For example, he mentions that Mallory caught his first display of Mt. Everest's \\"nitid summit\\", and that had me scrambling (not for the first time) for my dictionary, where I found that the term meant \\"bright with a steady but subdued shining\\". It's hard to beat such fascinating phraseology. The scenes that involve climbing are never repetitious or overly technical, adding to the flow of the words.<br /><br />It bears comment that when asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, Mallory is reputed to have said, \\"Because it is there.\\" Whether this is actually true or the figment of an inspired journalist's imagination, this has often been called the four most famous words in mountaineering. That being said, if you're looking for the factual, historical side of the disappearance of George Mallory, then a good place to start would be [[ASIN:0898868505 Ghosts of Everest]], which chronicles the 1999 Mallory & Irvine Research Expedition.<br /><br />Must note again that this audio version was splendidly read by English actor Roger Allam. If you enjoy Jeffrey Archer's works and Mr. Allam's style as a reader, then you might want to check into [[ASIN:1427203059 A Prisoner of Birth]], an audio edition that's a finalist in the 2009 Audie Awards in the Fiction category.<br /><br />Enjoy this one for the impeccable storytelling, then go look up the facts later if you like. It's a 5-star tale.mpeccable storytelling, then go look up the facts later if you like. It's a 5-star tale.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I loved this movie and watched it twice.  There are a lot of stars in this movie, it was a fun movie to watch.
0786838655|3.0|When I started I expected a pretty good book, and that's what I got.    Negatives:  -The Harry Potter resemblance is evident. It's not as bad as I'd heard, but the influence is clearly there.  -Percy's 'colloquial' narration is sometimes over the top. It just sounds like he's trying way too hard to sound casual.  -For the middle 50% of the book, the plot moves in a pretty episodic way(one monster encounter and then another). It's not necessarily bad, but it does interrupt the central storyline.  -Lots of unrealistically and unstylishly simplified stuff, most especially with some very fortunate coincidences when the characters need them, and some adults who just act like idiots.  The worst part is that most of these little plotting slipups are covered up with lame jokes.  The main plot is setup uber dramatic. The subplots mostly involve one or two silly escapes, not quite meshing well with the main one.    Positives:  -Good pacing, decent characterization, interesting ideas, and a good overall balance to the novel. It starts and ends on similar notes, resolving the most important issues.  -Easy reading. It's never ponderous.  -Exciting reading. Despite the Harry Potter discipleship, this book has a lot of good things purely of its own. It's engaging from the very start.    Overall:  Worth reading, and good enough to be read again. A solid 3.5 stars.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved the movie, and I thought the songs were great at matching the moments in the movie.  I was not disappointed by the album.  With the exception of just a few songs, I listen to this CD over and over again in my car.  I had never been exposed to Muse before, and I totally dig their song on here, \\"Supermassive Black Hole.\\"  I also love \\"Full Moon,\\" the Black Ghosts contribution.      My only disappointments were Perry Farrel's song (and I usually like his stuff!) and the song sung and played by Robert Pattinson (just not my thing).      In short, if you liked the movie, I think you'll probably like the soundtrack too.

I mean Timberland said himself he didn't even like Audioslave....If someone didn't like my old music I put all my heart and soul into I wouldn't even bother speaking to them, let alone work with them and allow them to mold me as they see fit and make a album that they saw fit. Still I gave it a shot but no......Better luck next album.....still love every album up until this one. Chris is still one of my favorite

B000001EHS|4.0|This Def Leppard collection brings back a lot of memories of the 80's and contains some really great songs. In my opinion, the songs that really rocked out were their best, as opposed to the softer, slower songs. I don't think Def Leppard was suited to those slower songs, but really rocked hard on songs like \\"Rock Of Ages\\", \\"Photograph\\", and so on. I just really enjoy their songs where they let themselves go totally, THAT is real rock! Overall, this is a good collection, but could have been better if only the hard-rocking songs were more concentrated on.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|Let me start by saying that we (my husband and I) thoroughly enjoy our share of basic \\"shoot 'em up\\" flicks and comic-book type movies.  We aren't looking to be profoundly moved or inspired when watching these types of movies; we just want to be entertained.      This is one of few movies that we actually shut off.  It was THAT bad.  As my husband said, \\"Not even the hotness of Angelina could save this one.\\"  That Morgan Freeman actually signed on to such a turkey is a disgrace to him; he's such a talented actor.  We love MOST of his work.    What are the problems?  Let me see.  Where do I start?    The movie can't decide if it wants to be realistic or fantasy.    The main character, Wesley, is annoying and unlikeable.  The premise is ridiculous, even in this genre.  It's over-the-top in how absolutely cheesy the entire thing is.    We shut it off at the point where \\"Wesley\\" launches his car over a limo to shoot the occupant.  I'm sorry.  It was just beyond stupid.    My husband gave me this movie for Christmas at my request.  He was considerably annoyed that he wasted his money on this movie and that he gave me such a cheesy gift.  This is one heading for the pre-owned movie store.  Otherwise, we can always take it to the gun range and put the thing to good use as a target.    Sorry, Morgan and Angie.  Neither your talent nor your looks could make this movie even the least bit tolerable.
0446402397|4.0|This book has been described as a real \\"page turner\\". Usually, when I see that, I am disappointed when I actually read the book. This book, however, was the real deal as far as page turning went. I lost a lot of sleep, because I could not put it down.<br /><br />I would warn readers that this book has some very disturbing things in it. It presents a pretty graphic portrayal of Stalinist Russia, including the famine and the methods of the secret police. Add to this a serial killer who targets children, and you have some rough going in many spots. But, it is a great story with lots of well done suspense. It is hard to put down once you get started.<br /><br />The author makes reference to the Chikatilo serial murders in Russia in his Further Reading page at the end of the book. I looked this up on Wikipedia and could see how much he based his killer on this actual one. Surprisingly, I knew someone who lived in the Rostov area where a lot of the actual murders took place and around the right time and don't remember ever hearing about this from him - maybe this was too unpleasant to discuss in a letter.<br /><br />Readers may find it strange, but the dialogue is all in italics without quotation marks. Must have been easier to write this way, but I have never seen this device before. It took me a little while to get used to it.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I did like the first 2/3's of the book better than the last part. It did get a little contrived towards the end, but by then I was hooked too well to care all that much. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because of this. Still, I would highly recommend the book.
B00005NGZX|4.0|I was going to write my review freely until I saw a critical review posted.  As far as that goes, the average music fan (i.e. those who listen to bands commonly heard on the radio) probably won't understand the CD.  Music fanatics, however, will dig it.    Now, I must confess; I wasn't a huge fan of Jacob Bannon's vocals on this album.  However, the musicianship demonstrated on this album is AMAZING.  I've heard their newer stuff, it's cool; and I've seen them live and that was beyond awesome.  However, this album contains many ideas that p-l-e-n-t-y of other bands took inspiration from.  The music itself is climactic and the drums are best described as brilliant (it's too bad more drummers in metal don't understand the concept of smart, technical drumming as opposed to blastbeating something to death.)  I say that the while the singing isn't conventional, it definitely serves a purpose as far as the music goes and if you can dig and pry beyond the surface, you'll see what many of the newer bands coming out have been listening to.    I recommend this for all fans of hardcore and metal.  I also recommend this for music snobs that want to have a \\"metal\\" album to show their friends that doesn't involve \\"jumping the f--- up!\\"

031606792X|5.0|I have read this book twice & it certainly brings out all different emotions. Love, disappointment, hate, fear and loneliness. I loved all of this book and even at 40, found I couldnt put it down. A must read !!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Contrary to some of the one star reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style of the book.  It is in-your-face with no apologies for the opinions expressed. In other words -- it speaks the truth as the author sees it.  Luckily, I happen to agree with him 100%.    Read it.  You won't be sorry.
B000B5XZLU|4.0|I'd been away from the Jamiroquai universe for a while. Then I recently caught a clip of their Verona concert and it was like discovering them for the first time again (I'm now seriously sad that I've never seen them live). I ran out and bought this album and I love it!     I cannot stop listening to the song \\"Tallulah.\\" The music on this song is excellent, but it's the lovelorn lyrics and JK's delivery that put it over the top for me.    Elsewhere, I love the deliciously sleazy groove running through \\"Feels Just Like it Should.\\" This is truly an instant Jamiroquai classic and justifiably so. \\"Seven Days in Sunny June\\" is sublime and represents some of the band's best songwriting ever. \\"Electric Mistress\\" is like a trippy journey back to the 80s. \\"Starchild,\\" \\"(Don't) Give Hate a Chance\\" and the title track are funky and beg you to sing along. Meanwhile, \\"World That He Wants\\" is a stripped down, acoustic number that harks back to the political content of some of the band's older work. \\"Hot Tequila Brown\\" and \\"Time Won't Wait\\" are upbeat, soulful songs that will put a smile on your face and keep it there for a long while.    The whole album flows really well, with uptempo numbers mixed with the slower songs to create a very loungy vibe. That's what I love most about Jamiroquai: their ability to craft albums that create and sustain a mood.    I love that they continue to make standout albums two decades into their career.
B001E95ZHY|5.0|i keep seeing these reviews and remarks that The Rocker is a rip off of Jack Black's The School of Rock.    expect for a line or part here or there, The Rocker stands on it's own merit and is completely awesome, just like The School of Rock.    Robert Fishman, aka FISH was the drummer for the band Vesuvius before they hit legendary status. When the manager asks the band to fire Fish and replace him with the Producer's nephew and get the big contract, they oblige and Fish is out.    20 years later, Vesiuvus is the biggest band in America and Fish is bouncing from job to job feeling sorry for himself that he could have and should have been the drummer for Vesuvius, even naming a couple of their songs before they hit big.    He's fired from his current job after getting into a fight with a co-worker who puts on the newest CD of Vesivus, which Fish doesn't want to hear.    He dumps, or rather, is dumped by his girlfriend so he moves in with his sister, played by Jane Lynch (Role Models, 40 Year Old Virgin). His nephew Matt is in a band called A.D.D., and they are scheduled to play at the upcoming prom. The band includes signer-songwriter Curtis (Teddy Gieger who actually is a real life musician) and gutiarist Amelia (Emma Stone,  Jules from Superbad). Their drummer is suspended from school, can't walk the graduation line, and is grounded by his mother, so the hunt begins for a new drummer.    With all options exhausted, they ask Uncle Fish, and he agrees to play drums at the Prom after a heart to heart with his nephew Matt. He shows up rock star style with backstage passes and without ever practicing, rocks the drums and band starts off awesome, but during the king-queen song, Fish gets overexcited being that it was the first time he had played drums or in a concert in over 20 years, and flies off on a drum solo during a slow dance and ruins the band's performance.    Feeling bad, he meets with the band a couple of days later and tells them that they are good and that their songs need to be heard, so he proposes a deal to get the band a gig with himself as the lead drummer.    Fish gets the gig, but in Indiana (the story takes place in Cleveland), so the kids cop up a fake story and Fish \\"borrows\\" his sister's car, she calls the cops, the kids get grounded, and Fish gets kicked out of his sister's house.    She keeps asking him to grow up, but as he says, \\"you can never take away the dream\\".    The band continues to practice, as Matt is good with computers and sets up 4 different webcams so they can continue to all practice despite being all grounded, but Fish, being old school, thinks the camera is a microphone and plays the drums completely naked!    Matt's sister sees the video and puts it on Youtube and BANG........Internet sensation.    They get signed to a contract and start touring, and i don't want to give away the story, but it's awesome, really enjoyable.    Christina Applegate (Curtis' Mom) and SNL's Jason Sudeikis (plays Joe Biden on SNL) also come out the movie with Jason playing the role of David Marshall, the band's manager. It's hilarious watching Jason's character trying to hit on Christina Applegate, and his lines are funny, like \\"yeah well, your body's changing.\\" LOL!!! ;) (inside joke-you need to watch the movie to understand). My favorite line was the John Lennon line.     Great movie overall, the soundtrack is awsome, Rainn Wilson is AWESOME and his drum playing is authentic. What makes the movie even better is the authenticity of the music, because Teddy Geiger, who plays Curtis is actually singing the song, and the 2 Vesivus songs that come out in the movie also come out on the soundtrack.    I know The Rocker didn't do so hot in the theaters, but I really liked this movie. it's very original (based in part on the story of Pete Best, original drummer of The Beatles before they fired him and before the Beatles hit it big. Best BTW, was replaced by Ringo Starr.    but overall, great movie, great songs, greatcomedy, good clean Rock movie.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|For the life of me I can't say why I keep watching this movie over and over but I do.<br /><br />The first time I watched it I didn't pay much attention and it caught my interest at the end so I had to re-watch it.  Then I started picking apart the physics and although there are the normal Hollywood stupidities - the overall physics are not too shabby (compared to most sci-fi's).  Then I just enjoyed the movie having picked it apart...<br /><br />This is a movie worthy of time and attention.  Its attractive in a dark, strange sort of way (ironic that its about bright sunshine and I find it a little dark...  :-)  )  Overall, this is a movie worth owning - not perfect but watchable more then once.
0743509919|5.0|The book is one of a kind thriller described as a fiction but it is a non-fiction. the 18 hour battle should be must read for any military commander which explain why procedures are needed, any how courage and friendship make soldiers of the same company a combat machine that can overcome 1000s of street fighter that cares nothing but to kill Americans.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Bought the neon glow knockoff that used the USB dongle.  What a waste.  They disconnected every few minutes making all but the simplest of games unplayable.  Bless Amazon for taking them back -- they were defective!  I bought these...exactly what the Doctor ordered.  Don't buy anything but the real deal.  The cost \\"savings\\" isn't worth it.
0446615641|5.0|This is the third of David Baldacci's books to feature the Camel Club. I do not know if he had three books with the Camel Club in mind initially, but he pulled it off brilliantly. This one, Stone Cold, is better than his last. I will point out that the books are best read in order because each book builds on the one previous.<br /><br />Two stories unfold, one of which is the conclusion to Annabelle Conroy's saga with Jerry Bagger.  Annabelle took the casino owner (and the person responsible for her moms murder) to the cleaners for millions and Jerry does not forget. Meanwhile, Stone has a killer looking for his old comrades in the spook world and then for Stone himself once it slips put that he is alive and well. The book is sometimes told through the eyes of the killer so we can see his reasoning and perspective.<br /><br />I could not put it down after I started reading it. The plot skips along at a break neck pace and Baldacci keeps you jumping from one location to another. Another great work! I cannot wait for his next.<br /><br />Author of Fantasy Football Guidebook and Fantasy Football Almanac 2009 (out 1 May 2009)
B000P0J02E|5.0|Hans Zimmer did an EXELLENT job in this soundtrack! My favorites are: Tack 5,Up Is Down, Track 10, What Shall We Die For, Track 11, I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time, and Track 13, Drink Up Me Hearties Yo Ho. In the final track Hans brings up the \\"He's A Pirate theme\\"one more time. This is one of the best soundtrack albums I've ever heard!
1427206031|5.0|I've been a fan of Jeffrey Archer since reading Kane & Abel, and now paths of glory continues on that greatness.    While the book is fiction, it's based on a real person, who's ascent of Mt. Everest remains cloudy.  Archer takes us on a fun journey of Mallory's life, with factual information used to create a larger story of what could have potentially been Mallory's life.    I had the audiobook version of this, it was unabridged, comes on 9cd's and takes just over 11 hours to complete.  The narration was pleasant, good enough to let you get into the story.
0688014291|5.0|Once you read this, you will never think a boss is as good as the one in the book...unless they have read it and use it! I can't say enough good things about this. Readable within an hour. Stays with you for a lifetime!!
B000001Y5J|5.0|NIN's second major album, 'Broken' is very different from Trent's debut, 'Pretty Hate Machine.' But 'Broken' is even better than the first, and one of the best metal albums ever released. While PHM had a feeling of sadness, 'Broken' is pure rage. It's short, but packs a violent punch and will leave you with a feeling of emptiness and a desire for more.
B000002KXV|5.0|this is an awsome album, there's not a bad song on it and it is very listenable. I love Steeley Dan and this is Nirvana for fans like me!!!! Give it five stars!
B001DEVZUG|5.0|it is great except only one of the two CD's play.  so i went to Target to buy the album again so i could listen to both CDs.  too much trouble to send back........peace   darrell
B001NTUDVI|3.0|I liked the singles that came off of this album. They were strong had great clubs beats and really good vocals. We belong together was a beatufial ballad.I thought shake it off was a great club song. It seems like this sound is alot more different then in all of her albums. It's really got some great production on it. While, this is not my favorite album from hers, i think she did an excellent job of making a great comeback, because she was about to be a has been like Janet. My favorite track is shake it off. Mariah just made some great music. I think she's made alot better sutff then this it was just the right time at the right place for her to be popular again.

B001FBSMF8|4.0|I was honestly skeptical about this album.  I absolutely love Chris's first solo album.  I did not even buy his second.  If you are a fan of music, including good pop music, which this clearly is, then you will enjoy this album.  It took me a few listens to warm up to it, but now I can't stop.  I listen to it twice a day from start to finish.  The album definitely works as a whole and has a great flow.  That is one thing that has gone by the wayside these days.  Just read a profession review of any modern album.  The first thing they do is dissect the album into worthy singles.  But, if you are not a hater and can appreciate a great album, this is a gem.
0780628551|2.0|If the script for [[ASIN:B00003CXCF Rosemary's Baby]] had been sold in 1999, rewritten by a total idiot to accommodate the then-success of TV's \\"The X-Files\\" that script would've been re-titled The Astronaut's Wife.    It's a movie that is almost grossly unoriginal. A movie that wastes no time jumping right into the \\"action\\" of the plot, but then feels drawn out in the middle-section.    Academy Award-nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, [[ASIN:B0007CNXUK Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)]]) stars as Spencer Armacost and Academy Award-winner Charlize Theron (Best Actress, [[ASIN:B00005JMUK Monster]])  As his wife Jillian Armacost. Spencer is an astronaut...I know you hadn't already guessed this, so I thought I'd let you know. Within minutes of the start time, Spencer and his fellow astronaut Alex Streck (Nick Cassavettes, the director of [[ASIN:B000683VI4 The Notebook (New Line Platinum Series)]]) are blasted off into space. Minutes after that, Jillian is contacted by NASA and informed that they have lost contact with Spencer for two minutes. Both Spencer and Alex return to Earth fine....But, within minutes, Alex has died of an apparent stroke and his wife has committed suicide. Taking no time to grieve, Spencer resigns from NASA and accepts an executive job with an aerospace firm. Spencer and Jillian relocate to New York and Jillian becomes pregnant with twins. Soon, a former NASA employee tracks down Jillian convinced that what happened to Spencer during those two minutes was something supernatural...Extraterrestrial even.    I doubt you'll even care when the film reaches this point. An hour into The Astronaut's Wife, I didn't care about the characters or what was going to happen to them. I didn't care what happened to Spencer during those two minutes. The script and these characters give you nothing to care about.    It's a film that seems to suspect its audience is a bunch of idiots. It explains things we already know and toys us with the notion that Spencer may be an alien, which we already guessed.    Furthermore, it's billed as a \\"thriller,\\" when there's nothing thrilling about it. There's nothing ominous or menacing about it, despite how hard it tries to be both of these things. Worse, its got a dramatic musical score that attempts to create false tension, including the clichéd LOUD MUSIC cue when a character opens a refrigerator to find another character standing behind it.     It is filled with ridiculous, textbook dialogue throughout. When character's meet, we're treated to the old:  \\"Hi, my name is...\\"  \\"Oh, you must be...\\"  \\"Of course, [insert witty comment].\\"  \\"[Laugh]\\"  \\"Call me.\\"    How embarrassed was Johnny Depp to recite the \\"explanation\\" of what \\"happened\\" to him during those two minutes?    This can't even be saved by the star power of Depp and Theron in performances that have PAYCHECK written all over them. Theron, a talented actress, cries and contemplates throughout. Her hairstyle is clearly a not-so-subtle tip-of-the-hat to Mia Farrow in \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\" As if the near plagiarism of the film's plot wasn't enough.    Finally, we're treated to a nonsensical finale that most people will miss because they will be sound asleep by the time the film reaches this point.    The Astronaut's Wife is nothing more than Rosemary's Baby by way of The X-Files, lacking in both the intelligence and entertainment value of the two.   In a word: Horrible.    GRADE: D
B001ILFUDM|4.0|Pinocchio is largely hailed as one of Walt Disney's most masterly creations, and one of the all time great movies, period. The animation is astonishingly fluid, evocative and filled with true character. The music has set standards that are still used today, including the use of an electronic instrument for a magical effect. The story is unforgettable -- and pretty scary in spots.<br /><br />As the generous bonus material explains, it was not a huge success in its initial release and several reasons are speculated upon. I would venture that it is also more of a \\"boy\\" story than a \\"girl\\" one, and Disney has always had better luck with the more romantic animated features. But who knows. It's certainly earned its keep by now, many times over, and comes to DVD and Blu-Ray disc in a new multi-disc edition.<br /><br />A friend of mine with a Blu-Ray player highly recommends this version (you mean YOU don't have a Blu-Ray Player??\\") The image is spectacular, as it was in the Sleeping Beauty Blu-Ray, so much so that you can even make out the painter's brush strokes!<br /><br />If you get the Blu-Ray version, you still get a standard DVD with the Audio Commentary by Leonard Maltin and master animator Eric Goldberg. It's as knowledgable and interesting as you might expect, though I do wonder whehter the claim that Mel Blanc's only Disney work was the omitted voice of Gideon -- isn't he Cousin Orville in the Carousel of Progress, or is that J. Pat O'Malley?<br /><br />Anyway, you do not get the second disc in standard DVD format unless you buy the standard DVD package, so the choice is up to you depending on your need for extras and if you are looking to transition to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />One little piece of trivia not found anywhere on the discs: you can hear a few notes of the deleted song, \\"Three Cheers for Anything\\" in the scene in which the boys sail for Pleasure Island. Our way of saying thanks for readiing this review!
038073186X|2.0|If you read this book, please, please, please don't think too hard about it. Don't think about the mystery, don't think about the possible solutions to what's going on, because you've read this book before. Or you've seen it on TV or at the movies. Or both. Quite possibly hundreds of times.<br /><br />The entire weight of this novel is balanced precariously on a thin, weak cliche. Once you see the cliche, the entire thing comes toppling down. Maybe you won't see it. But I would suggest not reading the back cover of the book, or any of the review blurbs, in which the answer is as made as clear as day. And again, don't think too hard when you're reading it, or the whole thing will crumble.<br /><br />The book starts out on such a strong, strong premise: missing persons report. An inmate - er, patient - has vanished from her cell in a hospital for the criminally insane. Which is located on an island. In an old army fort. And oh yeah, her room was locked from the outside. And there's a hurricane coming. And rumors that the hospital staff is conducting unethical treatments on its patients...<br /><br />Wow. I mean, seriously, wow. I was sold. I ate up the first 150 pages, loving every single minute. But there was something itching in the back of my brain, similar to how the protagonist feels a nagging understanding for a secret code he is given early in the book. That he knows the answer. About halfway through the book (literally the halfway mark), my suspicions were confirmed without a doubt (it's right there on the page). Honestly, I don't know how you could miss it, but based on the number of 5-star reviews, quite a lot of people did.<br /><br />Once you get what's going on, you realize in dismay that the remaining 200 pages are essentially filler until the grand exposition-ladden ending. And frankly, even if you were taken in by the plot, I simply don't see how you feel rewarded by what you finally learn. It's the kind of thing that has been done countless times in far better movies and books, to the point where it's barely one step above<br /><br />And even if you don't catch what was going until the end, I'm not sure how you can't feel the book is a cheat. I've never read anything else by Lehane, but I give him the benefit of the doubt that he usually does better than this. This seems like the type of thing that he tossed off in a month or two of writing. It's a lazy, lazy solution to what was a brilliant problem. I think Scorsese is going to get trounced by critics when this finally comes out.o the point where it's barely one step above     And even if you don't catch what was going until the end, I'm not sure how you can't feel the book is a cheat.

B001FBSMF8|5.0|I loved this CD from the minute I put it in my CD played on my way to work. Don't get me wrong, it's TOTALLY different from old Chris Cornell, BUT it is worth listening to. I really do love every song on this album, I love the sound and his voice still has the same sound. I really do like this, if you want to listen to something a little bit different buy this. If you don't have a very open mind, maybe you should just leave this one alone....

0143038095|4.0|The Joy Luck Club is composed of four sections, containing sixteen interwoven stories, all of which detail the different journeys of Chinese-born mothers who immigrated to the states, and their American-born daughters. The stories were touching and dealt with the universal themes of finding identity, the challenges that come with integration, and sacrificing for love. I found myself able to relate on some level with the mother/daughter relationships in these stories. Though my own circumstances are quite different, the complexities between mothers and daughters---longing to please one's mother while trying to find one's own, separate identity, as well as the notions of sacrifice and the idea that one carries on her mother's legacy---are translatable on some level to my own life and relationship with my mother. In this sense, I was very pleased with the novel. It continues to keep my interest.
B001N44BVQ|4.0|Okay, I'd be the first to admit that DiCaprio was an odd choice to play Ferris. He doesn't look Middle Eastern at all, but other than I think the actor does a good job. Granted I only got sixty pages into the book before seeing the movie. Crowe's character is interesting and rather funny. He talks about intelligence operations at the family soccer game and while he helps brushes his kids teeth. The movie has just got an odd air about it tho. The first time I watched this movie I enjoyed it but it wasn't what I was expecting, but when I popped it in when I was bored a few days later I really enjoyed it. DiCaprio is the only part that through me off but tbh I thought he was good he can pull action movies like Departed and Blood Diamond rather well. But he doesn't fit a Middle Eastern spy lol
B00005JPY2|1.0|I went to see Watchmen with high hopes. Unfortunately, I found it too graphically violent (Rorshach's killing the child killer is a good example). If this is why Alan Moore took his name off the movie, I can understand why he did.

B0000VCT7G|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars for anything less than a masterpiece.  This has all the right ingredients and encompasses old with new in a way that no one else(has ever come this close).  It may not be for everyone but this album will go down in history as one of the top 100 ever, it truly is breathtaking. It does take a certain level of musical maturity.  This reminds me of so many other artists yet it is original (Laurie Anderson, David Bowie, for example).  If you don't like this then there is really something wrong with you. This is in my top 10 pick and I like all kinds of music. It is amazing.
B00000IREA|1.0|I bought the VHS version of the movie long before I entered the Army. To give a short review of the movie it is just a crappy soft core porn video with bad acting and horrid special effects. It is easy to see why Jane Fonda never did anything better with her career. If you want soft core scifi porn get emanuelle(sp?) in space. Then I learned of how she acted during the Vietnam War. I hate to think I financially supported this women after what she did.
0452289963|5.0|Reading \\"THE NEW EARTH\\" by Eckhart Tolle elicits a new awakening in one's self that I knew deep down was there but didn't quite know how to tap it.  This new awakening is a wonderful experience.  Life has a new meaning.  Once I read the book I did not put it down.  Instead I opened it up and read it again.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I don't have Showtime so my only outlet for seeing Dexter was to buy Seasons 1 and 2. On rainy weekends, it a great source of marathon Dexter days. Anyone who likes clever writing and good character development will enjoy Dexter. Add a splash of drama, sex, and tension and you have a well rounded show. I bought the first book by Jeff Lindsay which is different, as usual, but I think the writers and producers of the TV show did an excellent job taking a written character and attaching someone like Michael C. Hall to it. I'm happily awaiting Season 3 and can't wait to see if it makes it to Season 4. I hope!!

WHAT KIND OF PARENTS BRING THEIR KIDS TO AN R-RATED FILM!! Seriously, they have no one to blame but themselves.    I heard a lot of complaints about the sex and action scenes being too explicit.  But if you READ THE COMIC YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO EXPECT. This isn't your typical 'comic book movie' by any means. It isn't about superheroes coming together, being the good guys and saving the day. The whole point of the original series was to question what if these people existed in the REAL real world? Would they be upstanding citizens masquerading in cute little costumes, or would they be pseudo-sociopaths on the fringe of society?  This interpretation is that they are the latter. These people are ugly, amoral, messed up, self-centered, self-serving S.O.B's. The whole point of the story was to take the typical comic book hero and turn it on it's head. It's part murder mystery, part social commentary, part alternate history interpretation.  I could have done without the girl who played Silk Spectre II--pretty much eye candy and that was it. But the rest of the cast was perfect.  I especially loved Jackie Earle Haley's interpretation of Rorschach. He was Heath Ledger's Joker times ten. If there was ever an actor who deserved an Oscar nomination for a character, this was it. To be able to do what he did while wearing that mask almost the whole time was phenomenal. Unfortunately, this is not one of those films that you can just walk into blindly. You pretty much HAVE to read the comic if you want to know what is going on. That can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you expect. but this isn't a lighthearted popcorn flick. Those who went simply because of the hype should have done their homework before they saw it.  I for one absolutely loved it. I've seen it three times and will probably see it three more.

0375424474|4.0|An excellent book showing evolution from the standpoint of the many vestiges of ancestral creatures that still exist in modified form in our own bodies. How anyone could ever doubt evolution when such a wealth of information of this type exists, is a mystery. I strongly recommend it.
B001PJ7TUE|3.0|I wasn't expecting anything that compared to The Prodigy's first three albums, but I had really hoped to like this latest CD.  It really fell flat.  There are fleeting moments of The Prodigy's greatness, but overall it was a total let down. Don't bother.
1401216676|5.0|For any fan of Batman or Comics in general this is a must have. This graphic novel was one of the first Comics I bought and I loved it. When this special edition came out I pre ordered it as soon as I could.     This is basically the origin of the Joker, it  also has one of the biggest events in Batman Mythology. In this story we not only get to see what started the Joker on his mad rampage but we get to see just how Far the Joker can push Jim Gordon and Batman. The art work is amazing and the story is even better. I wont give to much away because it should be apart of everyone's comic collection. The special interviews with the writer and artist are fun to read at the end. Great product and Amazing story.
006085880X|5.0|I cry at movies, but there's not many books that I cry about.  This one is a heart wrencher and a very good read.  I didn't quite understand the ending as Ms Picoult leaves it to interpretation.  A better ending would have been.......WAIT! I don't want to spoil it for you.  Read it.  It's good.
1400082773|3.0|I've just finished Dreams from My Father, and I am disappointed. While I have been very excited about and supportive of the candidate and now President Obama, I am glad I read this book after I voted for him. The writing is dull, cumbersome, and often boring and cliched. So he is not a writer--fine. But what upset me about this book is the absence of insight and wisdom. There are just so few inferences and interpretations of what he'd experienced! The book tells you nothing about the man who had written it. I don't mean only personal details; I am talking about thoughts, ideas, philosophy. Yes, you do find out, what we all know, that he is sincerely and passionately concerned about the suffering of others, particularly poor blacks. This is important and comes across clearly. But nothing else. There are so many characters in the book that you never remember who's who, and so many trivial dialogues that you often forget the bigger picture. The father and the grandfather he is looking for in Africa do not seem to have commendable characters, but the narrator--Obama-- is mum about his discoveries of their rather abusive and dissolute lives. There are no conclusions, no honest confrontations of the truth, and that's what makes this book--as a memoir--cowardly. I hope the President is almost an entirely different person from the narrator of Dreams from My Father. So far, he is doing very well, but I wish he'd stop hopping around the country in his campaign mode.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Great movie! One of the best of all time.  Our kids have probably watched it about 20 times since it arrived ... and we've only had it for two weeks!  Still going to see alot of this movie, but it's great family viewing, time after time after time.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|Script looks contrived, uninteresting. James McAvoy used to have a peculiar nice voice. That is missing in this movie; may be he tried American accent and its bad. He looks like a fool. Angelina just cashed on her looks. \\"Look at me, I am beautiful\\" attitude. She did not act at all. I bet each actor/actress in this movie have acted in a better movie other than this.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|This movie is by far a better way to end the classic boxing franchise and a welcome return to form as well.     It's not the best in the series, it's entertaining and well acted however unlike some of the other Rocky movie (1,2+3) this one doesn't have, in my opinion, a bad guy whom you really want Rocky to beat. Apollo Creed was cocky but a good bad guy and Mr. T was just fantastic, great attitude, memorable quotes and believable character. In this one Mason 'The Line' Dixon is arrogant but I don't think to the point of abnoxiousness. Not enough of an error to take this film down a star or two.    Great ending, even though Rocky lost his final fight in a metaphorical way he kinda won. Think about it, Rocky will always be a winner to all of us.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I don't think Pixar has gone wrong yet, and that is certainly true with \\"Cars.\\"  Lightning McQueen is on the fast-track to being a big star (literally, he's a race car).  However, after finding himself stranded in run-down little Radiator Springs--a once-prosperous old Route 66 town that fell off the map when the Interstate bypassed it--he realizes the importance of slowing down, and how much it matters to care for others.
B000WC3A0S|4.0|This boxset comes with all 6 of the Rocky movies, I recently bought this boxset at a slightly reduced price.   I personally enjoyed 5 out of the 6 Rocky movies, for me that is enough of a percentage to get this boxset. Can you guess which one I don't like? Sorry, but i'm not going to surprise you here. I think Rocky 5 is the worst in the series, however I overlooked the fact that it came in this boxset as I really enjoy the other 5.    Rocky is a classic, undoubtedly. Rocky 2 was a good a sequel as one could hope for considering, i mean how do you follow up a classic. Rocky 3 was an enjoyable romp with a truly memorable bad guy. Rocky 4 is a guilty pleasure which has some enjoyable moments. Rocky 5, the least said about this one the better. Finally Rocky Balboa (number 6) is a great finish to the series, although Stallone does look quite old the acting and boxing is quite believable.     All-in-all a good boxset with only 1 of the 6 movies a down point other wise it is worth owning. Not quite a 5 star because Rocky 5 is so poor and Rocky 4 is only a 3 out of 5 star movie.     \\" Clubber what's your strategy for the match? Don't need any.    What's your prediction? Pain\\" Classic.
0312383320|3.0|I adore 97% of Janet Evanovich's books. This is one of the 3% I don't. Never had a problem with a Stephanie Plum book before, but I suppose they can't all be laugh out loud hilarious. This one was a definite drag.     The usual characters are there - Stephanie, Ranger, Morelli, Lula, and of course Grandma Mazur. Unfortunately none of them get any good lines. There were also some new ones - E. Bunny and Sasquatch, who had potential but never got a chance. Also Elmer, about whom the less said the better. He is one character who should not exist.    In fact, the whole book would be better off unprinted. Its action was completely unfocused, the plot so convoluted as to be unfathomable, and there were way too many fart jokes and monkeys giving people the finger. Not cute the first time around, and unbelievably annoying after the thousandth repetition. This might have been funny to 13 year old boys but I can't say I was amused. C'mon JE, can't you think of anything better than falling to that level? Granted, the Plum series never pretended to be great literature, but at least they were fun. This book isn't.  If we're going to fall to the Junior High School level, at least we should have fair warning. And it doesn't help that I of all the animals I have worked with over the years, monkeys are the only ones I loathe.     Nevertheless, there is some good writing under there, which is why I gave it three stars instead of fewer. The delectable Diesel is there, with enough sexual tension to keep you going.(In my opinion, Morelli is a poor third behind him and Ranger, but I digress). There is some amusement in the subplot involving Morelli's no-good brother, and the usual antics of Stephanie and Lula's incompetent bounty-huntering. But really, this is the weakest of the Plum series, so skip this unless you're a die-hard fan. Then again I am that, and I still would have been better off to have followed that advice.
1603580557|4.0|I have been a proponent of Systems Theory for some time now.  My first exposure to the concept was through the work of Lee Thayer in relation to Communications System Theory.  Thayer is a brilliant theorist but he is dry as prehistoric timber.  Not so Meadows.  Meadows does an excellent job of not only outlining the basic precepts of System Theory but applying in relatable terms the application of the mindset in addressing and solving a multitude of issues addressing us both individually and corporately.    A great read that I encourage regardless of your political or philosophical bent.
B000001ESN|5.0|Rush are, without any doubt, one of the best progressive rock bands ever to exist. I saw these guys 5 times and I think the tour for this disc was the last time. I can tell you there is no studio trickery with these guys, they are the real deal onstage. I'm sure quite a few people are familiar with the song Spirit of Radio and maybe Freewill but don't overlook Entre Nous and one of my favorites, Natural Science. These guys are just top notch musicians and there are enough great twists and turns to satisfy any prog rock fan. I think the buffoons that run the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame should be ashamed of themselves for not yet inducting Rush. Oh, they have no problem inducting a RAP act but not a great progressive rock band like Rush. Can you say c-l-u-e-l-e-s-s!<br />Get this disc, as other reviewers have noted it's definitely one of their best.<br />[...]
B000RZGFZC|5.0|From the blistering opening track \\"War Ensemble\\", to the crushing \\"Dead Skin Mask\\", to the title track reminiscent of Black Sabbath, this album is an entirely different experience from the \\"Reign in Blood\\" era Slayer, but still just as powerful and memorable. While the guitar work is still highly technical controlled chaos, and Araya's voice seems more mature, Lombardo's chops on drums are, as always, incredible. One particularly memorable moment is during a breakdown in the middle of \\"Spirit in Black\\", where he rolls the bass drum with machine gun precision.     From start to finish this album shows a mature side of Slayer that both allowed them to grow as a band post-Reign, and still showcased what they did best.
B0000524CY|5.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" came out on Boxing Day, 1973 and immediately became a boxoffice phenomenon. Highly regarded by critics and fans as the best thriller ever made, \\"The Exorcist\\" tells of a true story in which a 12 year old girl is possessed by satan. The movie is also one of the best movies ever made, with amazing performances by all the leads, especially Ellen Burstyn who plays the mother, and Linda Blair who plays the little girl. The movie also won 2 Oscars, one for sound and the other for the screenplay. I also believe both Burstyn and Blair were robbed of Academy Awards for their roles, as some had a hard time with the posession that took place in the story. The movie is about the forces of good and evil in the world and the eventual outcome of that battle. There have also been other sequels and pre-quels to \\"The Exorcist\\", but they are all inferior to the original. The follow up \\"The Exorcist 2\\" is regarded as one of the worst films ever, although Linda Blair is in it. Ellen Burstyn refused to be a part of it as she felt the script was awful.<br /> This DVD release also features 11 minutes of extra scenes that were omitted from the original release, which also contains the horrifying \\"spider walk\\" sequence.<br /> Not appearing on this disc, unfortunately, is the amazing BBC documentary on the making of \\"The Exorcist\\", that was featured on the 1998 25th Anniversary Edition of the movie. If you can find that edition grab it as the documentary is informative and interesting.<br /> Also, Ellen Burstyn's autobiography called \\"Lessons In Becoming Myself\\" is a wonderful read and she goes into detail on how she got the role of Chris McNeil and the trouble the cast and crew found themselves in while making it.
B000A2WNB2|5.0|I am old enough to have been to variety of rock concerts from Hot Tuna to Heart to Robert Plant's 2005 tour,  and I have never seen anything quite like Muse. I can't wait until I get the chance to see them truly live, and am disappointed that they have been so far off American radar that I did not know about them until this past fall. Until then, this dvd and others help fill the gap.     The concert at Le Zenith was great, my favorite moment is when Matt is actually singing, playing guitar and playing the piano all at once in Ciitizen Erased. The second disc is a riot, almost as much fun as Monty Python.    My Sony system refused to play these discs, but they work fine on my son's Cyberhome player, my other son's xBox, and on the Phillips dvd player I recently acquired to make up for the Sony's shortcomings.
1400082773|3.0|This one moved too slow for me, especially when we got to the extended family in Africa.  The ending also seemed to be hurried.  What was amazing to me is he wrote this while still a student in college, roughly 25 years old.

I'm really looking forward to it!
0688145078|5.0|We bought this book for our 2 1/2 year old to prepare him for his new sibling, and he absolutely loves it.  It's the first book he brings to us every night to read.  The book's simple language is easy for him to understand, and for the first time he seems to be getting what it means to be a big brother.  The book has also helped him understand the HE will be a big brother very soon. And it shows him that he'll still be special to his mommy and daddy, without overemphasizing it (a lot of the books I've seen have tended to play up the insecurities that could arise in having a sibling, which doesn't seem like something that should be brought up if the child isn't having issues with this).  The only drawback I saw to this book is that the baby in the story is bottle fed, and our new baby won't be.  So I just insert a word and say the baby likes \\"mommy's milk\\" instead of just \\"milk.\\"

B001PPLJIQ|3.0|This is a tough film to review. Immediately after watching it, the first though that sprung to mind was- do I like this or not? I couldn't tell. I know I didn't hate it, but I couldn't figure out how I really felt about it. After stewing it over for a while, I came to the conclusion that I did like it, but I certainly didn't love it. It is a difficult film to care for, perhaps because every character comes off as irritating and/or irrational and/or pitiful. The list goes on.    This is not a Holocaust film. I really wish people would stop calling it that. In fact, the earliest date in the film is over 10 years after WW2 ended. This does reference aspects of the Holocaust, specifically a certain concentration camp and what occured there with Kate Winslet's character Hanna Schmitz.    The movie takes place in three acts. The first is certainly the best. There we meet Hanna and a boy named Michael Berg, played maturely by David Kross. He is very young, either 15 or 16, I can't remember. She is in her thirties. To make a long story short- they begin to have an affair. She awakens in him passion and sexuality, and being a teenager, he can't get enough of it, or her. After a while, she tells him that before they can make love, he must read a book to her. He agrees and they fall into a pattern. They both seem content for a while until one day, Michael goes to her flat, and finds that she has moved.    He moves on and goes on to college where we find he is studying to be a lawyer. This is where Act 2 goes into play and really all the heavy angsty stuff emerges. His professor takes the class to see an actual court case where Michael finds the defendant is none other than Hanna. She, and several other women, are on trial for crimes commited during the Holocaust.     Michael is stunned and watches the proceedings in morbid fascination, while simultaneously feeling pained, saddended and probably betrayed and/or disgusted. He discovers a terrible truth then and must decided whathe should do with that particular bit of information. Here is the part of the film where my thoughts became confused and jumbled. I will not go into the plot further for that would be to spoil everything, but I can say I found it odd and once again, irritating.    The last act is by far the weakest. We see a grown-up Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes living his life. We actually see him periodically throughout the film, in flashbacks, well in this case, flash forwards. Again, so as not to spoil the plot, I'll just say that I personally didn't care for the latter part of the film and while I can't say I hated it, it left a sour taste in my mouth.     The acting is superb. Kate has her well-deserved oscar and I am just thrilled for her. She completely deserved it. Though she won for best actress, I must stress that, for the most part, I saw her as more of a supporting role, even though she is the biggest female role of the film. I can't really explain my thinking-it's better to see it for yourself. Fiennes does a wonderful job as usual. He brings a quiet calming quality to Michael, and yet you can tell that something simmers in the back of his mind and has for years.     It's frustrating for me not to have a conclusive opinion about this film. The pedigree is there. The plot should be moving and dramatic and surprising. Still, it's just one of those films that leaves you hanging, a million emotions in your head, an no proper way to desribe them.
B001HUHBAE|5.0|I am a Blu-ray disc enthusiast and I have to say that this film has been given top notch treatment in its transter to HD. I owned this film in Standard DVD and now own it on Blu-ray disc and the difference in video quality is amazing. While the Standard DVD looked good upconverted to 1080p in my HDTV, it simply could not match the three-dimensionality, vibrant color, and detail of the Blu-ray version. This is one of the best Blu-ray discs I have seen and would highly recommend it to fans of the film.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|The Curious Case of Benjamim Button is by no means a feel-good movie. In fact upon watching it, I felt depressed even the next day just thinking about it. People may confuse this for a love story but to me the film clearly symbolizes death. The love aspect is certainly present, though it is not the center of attention here.     Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin Button, a man who essentially ages backwards. When he is born, his own father attempts to drown him before a sudden change of heart has him leaving the swaddled and very whithered newborn upon the steps of an elderly home. There he is found by Queenie, played to motherly perfection by Taraji P. Henson. She sees past the deformity and oddity and loves him immediately.     Instead of dying, as a doctor predicted, Benjamin actually begins to age backwards. He appears as a very old man and slowly grows younger, but only in body. His mind seems to function as a typical human's mind. He learns, and dreams and experiences. This basically sets up the magnificent story and from then on, you are taken from country to country, from one decade, to another and it is just superb to witness.    The acting is fantastic all around. Brad Pitt does an outstanding job, portraying both the old Benjamin as well as his younger counterpart. Cate Blanchett as his childhood friend/love interest is also a joy to watch. She can do no wrong, she is simply stunning. For such a short part, Tilda Swinton surely makes the most of it. Her tale and part with Benjamin in Russia is just stunning. There is also the talented Julia Ormond, who has a bigger part to play in the tale than we may realise at first.     The most impressive aspect of the film is the flawless visual effects. Just flawless. You have never seen aging/deaging done like this. There is a scene, towards the end, with Benjamin and Daisy (Blanchett) that had my jaw dropping. It was like looking back in time. I can't describe how utterly impressed I was. The cinematography, the sad musical score, the costumes, just every little minute detail is just so impressive and authentic.     I have heard grumbles from people who compare it to Forrest Gump. What? How? There should not be any comparing the two films-or the two characters. Gump was a slow and mostly ignorant person who fell into unbelievable situations. Button clearly chooses his own paths, though it may not seem it, at the beginning. It irritates me how someone can make such a comparison.     This is a long film, nearly three hours, though with the plot and subject matter, it makes sense and really, it is such a beautiful film, you hardly notice the passing of time. Like I mentioned, it will leave you feeling blue but that does not diminish from the fact this is one of the better newer films out there now, and one that people will remember in the future.

B001JNNE64|2.0|I'm writing this review as someone who absolutely loves the film \\"Amadeus.\\"  It really is one of the top ten films made after 1980 -- a gorgeous, engrossing, funny, hugely entertaining achievement.<br /><br />I'm also writing this review as someone who does not own the Blu-Ray edition and in fact refuses to buy it in its current form, even at the low, low sale price of $13.99.<br /><br />Why?  And why only two stars?  For one reason and one reason only:  this Blu-Ray edition does not (as far as I can tell) contain the original theatrical release.<br /><br />When \\"Blade Runner\\" was released on Blu-Ray last year, I snatched it up immediately.  I even paid $30+ for it -- gladly.  Why?  There were FIVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS of the film included in the package, including the original release with Harrison Ford's voiceover.<br /><br />When \\"The Godfather Trilogy\\" was released on Blu-Ray, I paid more than $40 for it -- gladly -- because they had ALL THREE Godfather films included in the package.<br /><br />So it's baffling why they didn't do the same thing with \\"Amadeus.\\"  At $30+ or even $40+ it would've been a steal.  Without the original theatrical cut, I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this Blu-Ray disc.<br /><br />I own the standard-definition DVDs of \\"Amadeus\\" -- both the original theatrical version (released in 1997!!) AND the Director's Cut that was released a few years later.  While the Director's Cut DOES make some things a little clearer in the story, nothing in the Director's Cut -- NOTHING -- makes it a better film.  With all due respect to Milos Forman, the original theatrical version is VASTLY SUPERIOR to the Director's Cut.  The storytelling is tighter, the film more engrossing.  The scenes that were added in the Director's Cut with Kenneth MacMillan and the barking dogs would've been better in a Deleted Scenes section of the DVD -- they're extraneous, superfluous.  Too many notes.<br /><br />It's like the French plantation sequence in \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (ANOTHERDVD package that was smart enough to include both the \\"Redux\\" version AND the original theatrical release), where you can't wait for the director's self-indulgent digression to end so you can get back to the story.<br /><br />I would MUCH prefer to watch my 1997 standard-definition DVD of the original theatrical release than pay more than $5 for this Blu-Ray edition.  If you've never seen the film, I envy you -- you'll love it.  But don't buy this version.  Get this one instead:  http://www.amazon.com/Amadeus-F-Murray-Abraham/dp/6304712936/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1237481543&sr=8-2<br /><br />The picture quality won't be as good as Blu-Ray, but you'll be seeing a better film.

B001N26GFC|4.0|I'm not really sure if I would call this a straight up comedy, but then again it wasn't a drama, it just was what it was. For the most part I loved the character of Poppy, she's always in a good mood trying to make other people's days better and live the life she wanted. At some points I did think she could stop talking if only for a few minutes though. Most of the time she was pretty funny, I'll admit.<br /><br />I loved the tension between her and her driving instructor Scott, they are complete opposites. Poppy pushed Scott's buttons the whole time and got a great laugh out of it. I also loved the scenes between Poppy and her flatmate Zoe, you could tell they were great friends.<br /><br />There was one rather strange scene that didn't really fit with the rest of the movie though, it was only during the special features that it made any sort of sense to me, I found that scene unnecessary. The ending I felt was rather rushed, it just kind of ending when I personally thought there was a bit of unfinished business that need to be dealt with.<br /><br />All in all this was a sweet quirky movie that definitely deserves a viewing.

Her range from little girl to saged diva delivers just the right mood for the lucky listener. I can never fully rid myself of her \\"Breathless\\" cut, nor do i want to.

B000EGDB10|5.0|Despite the fact I got \\"lost\\" several times on the first two viewings, the film was so intriguining I had to keep viewing. It was fun to watch, regardless. After three viewings I finally figured it out! The point is: if you get a little confused trying to follow the plot, don't feel stupid. This isn't an easy story to follow but it gets high marks for keeping it interesting despite that problem.    The interesting characters, good cinematography, fun James Bond-like gadgets, just the right amount of action scenes and one very memorable heist scene with Tom Cruise dangling from a wire all make this an enjoyable two hours of entertainment. That scene with Cruise trying to break into this vault-like room remains as the one of the better tension-filled scenes I've ever witnessed on the big screen.    The final action scene with the speeding train and helicopter also is very memorable. John Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry Czerny and Jean Reno make it a fun cast to watch, too.      Now that it is available on a good Blu-Ray transfer, I may just buy this again and keep watching it for many more yeas.

B000002GKT|5.0|This is one of the best albums that \\"HUMBLE PIE\\" every put out. It is also one of the best \\"Live\\" albums I have ever heard and I have heard  a bunch. I had this on \\"8 Track\\" when I was in High School and wore it out. IT'S THAT GOOD!!!! A must have for \\"HUMBLE PIE\\" fans. If you were  never fortunate enough to see them in concert (I saw them in 71') check this out!!!!!!!!!! ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!
0375707972|5.0|I loved The Reader!!! It is probably the most well written book I have ever read. The story is about love above all things, and how your first true love will effect your life. I couldn't put it down after I finished the book I went to see the movie. It followed the book so well. I would recommend both and I have to everyone I know. I can't stress how much I loved this book. I hope you choose to read this book. You be missing out if you didn't. It's a wonderful love story for the ages!!!!!

076790592X|5.0|I was recommended this novel by a friend of mine and what a gem! I read it in 3 days. I laughed, cried, reflected, was inspired-I really loved reading this book. I assign this book as a reading assignment to my college students. Many of them have similar feelings. Tuesdays with Morrie lends itself to great in-class discussions. More over, I am pleased that my students enjoy this book because it helps in nurturing the desire to read for pleasure and not because it's \\"a class assignment.\\"

That is essentially what improvisation is - living freely in the moment. And that's what Ornette and his trio were doing when they cut this revolutionary recording back in 59 (arguably the greatest year for jazz music ever). Lock the doors, hide the kids, and by all means, be afraid, be very afraid, because this music was not created for the faint of heart. Stan Getz has left the building!<br /><br />Think you can really define Jazz music? Think again. Because after listening to this album, you might wish to reconsider your definition, for O.C. and the boys truly redefined the word. And it has never been the same since.  A major breakthrough recording, this quartet - Coleman (alto sax), Don Cherry (cornet), Billy Higgins (drums) & Charlie Haden (bass) - almost completely abandon the use of chord structures and all conventionality as well.  They just let it all rip!  And as my Amazon amico Unlucky Frank recently scribed in his excellent review regarding Sonny Rollins & co.'s live classic \\"Night at the Village Vanguard\\" - `this music requires active participation on the part of the listener. If you are attentive, you're in for a real treat.'  Couldn't have said it better, this is not music you are going to want to play at your next cocktail party (unless you want to shock the you-know-what out of them all!) or when you are placidly perusing a book or the morning paper.  See Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, et al... for those sits.<br /><br />I am not going to pretend to even remotely have as much knowledge about music as many of the reviewers here possess.  Just got into jazz music about seven years ago and my addiction continues to grow hourly.  It took me a while to truly appreciate and comprehend this avant-garde classic.  What I love the most about this music is that every time I listen to this one I hear something new and fresh that I didn't pick up on the times before.  EVERYTIME!  One of the characteristics of great art in my opinion - it challenges you to use that little ball in between your ears!<br /><br />If nothing else, I urge you music fans out there to listen to this recording just to hear how absolutely amazing Charlie Haden is on bass.  I believe this was his debut, and what a debut it was.  Just caught Charlie last year live at a local jazz show and I was absolutely floored.  The cat still has the chops!!!  One of the most unique bass players you will ever hear, and this is where it all began folks.<br /><br />The jazz world's \\"The Rite of Spring\\".

0805087184|5.0|I am a first grade teacher and my students absolutely love this story (and all Eric Carle stories). I use this book in the beginning of the year because the kids love the rhyming and being able to read along with the repeating phrases. Plus, a lot of the kids have read this in Kindergarten or Preschool, so it is familiar to them and they feel comfortable and participate. We read Eric Carle books all year long and the students love his distinctive illustrating with the bright and colorful images. I also revisit this favorite book at the beginning of each new season and we create our own classroom book based on the things we see as the seasons change. For example in the winter with a student named Bob- \\"Bob, Bob, what do you see? I see the white snow covering the tree\\". Lots of activities can be done with this book. I definitely recommend it!

0930289234|5.0|I'll get the cliche out of the way right off the bat.  \\"Watchmen\\" was a complete deconstruction of the comic book superhero genre.  I can't imagine what it was like to have read this work when it was first released.  After walking out of the film having put this comic off for over a year to not ruin the most highly anticipated cinematic experience of 2009, I felt like I'd been hit by an atomic bomb.  All of the praises and hype and glowing reviews over the most celebrated graphic novel of all time did not prepare me for a story that layered, epic, and DARK.  I bought the comic the very next day.  I paid double what Amazon was charging for it at my local mall to avoid an excruciating 3-5 day wait.  I'd put off the legendary work of literary genius long enough.<br /><br /> Back to my original point, now.  \\"Watchmen\\" was obviously conceived as an all-out assault on the costumed heroes we grew up idolizing.  A human story with larger-than-life characters who at the end of the day were not only flawed like you and I, some of them bordered on downright pathetic and/or psychotic.  Gluttony, Lust, Envy, Sloth, Wrath, Greed, Pride; all are well-represented among the \\"heroes\\" of the dystopian  alternate 1986 where the story takes place.  Hell, some might say they are the stars.  But as jaw-droppingly bold as that premise alone was and is, that is barely the beginning.  \\"Watchmen\\" is an absolute tour-de-force of creative artistry, brilliant structuring, and amazing writing.  Alan Moore does not mess around.  Whether blowing up Parliament in a future totalitarian Britain, dissecting hookers with Jack the Ripper, or crippling Batgirl with a bullet to the spine, this is one author who NEVER  holds back and only needs one color to paint his desired picture of the world: black.  And this is his hands-down masterpiece.<br /><br />I won't bore you with details of the story that most everyone knows by now, but what I will do is regale you with but a few reasons why I love this book.  Rorschach opens the story with a noirish monologue in the form of a journal entry that is to die for.  Angry, spiteful, bile that makes Travis Bickle look look like the world's biggest optimist spills out from the blood-covered panels, letting you know without saying so that Superman don't live here and Batman is a big, mushy wuss.  And in a way, Rorschach is the heart and soul of this book.  \\"Even in the face of Armageddon.  Never compromise\\" are the words he speaks, andthey sum up the attitude Moore must have had when he conceived this story.  And there is no motto I respect more.  At the end of the day, this comic is not just a deconstruction of costumed superheroes; it's a deconstruction of our entire race.  An invitation to gaze into the abyss and know the darkness of the human heart, while still valuing it's worth.<br /><br /> While I love the abundant nudity, dazzling look, and violent action of the film, the comic shies away from focusing on cheap thrills and rather pulls you into it's world and makes you a citizen of it.  There is absolutely sex, violence, nudity, and fantastic imagery in the pages,  but it is often intentionally downplayed in favor of more intellectually immersive endeavors such as ending each of the 12 chapters with famous and darkly relevant verses of poetry and including reading materials from the worl of \\"Watchmen\\" both integrated into the story and as spacers between chapters/issues.  \\"Tales of The Black Freighter\\" is a  comic within the comic that one character can be seen reading while other characters talk about the state of the world in the background.  One almost feels as though he is peaking over the child's shoulder and reading this bleak and twisted story while people discuss the world's imminent collapse around him.  How you relate this tale of woe within the larger tale of woe to the primary narrative is up to you.  It may be the single best reason to pick up the graphic novel even if you saw the movie and don't necessarilyread comics.  I suspect the latter will no longer be true once you finish \\"Watchmen\\".  This is one of the shining examples of what the medium can accomplish.<br /><br />Each of Moore's characters in \\"Watchmen\\" serves as a classic archetype.  Archetypes he willfully destroys.  Rorschach is the classic hard-boiled detective with a traumatic past, like Batman if he were to go off the deep end and become a savage avenger instead of the troubled hero.  The line is a thin one and only a fictional character could tread it for so long.  Silk Spectre II is the classic woman who resents her mother's firm guiding hand and her attempts to fulfill her own dreams through her.  And then there're the daddy issues.  Naturally, she seeks sanctuary in male \\"companionship\\".  Obvious?  Yes, a bit, but throw in a crime-fighting career and the cliche takes on an interesting new wrinkle.<br /><br /> Enter Doctor Manhattan, who will be playing the role of God in this work of fiction.  No, not exactly, but the metaphor is absolutely there.  With all of the limitless powers bestowed upon characters like Superman and Silver Surfer it's interesting that no one ever took this aspect to it's logical psychological extreme before this.  Complete detatchment from humanity and eventual apathy towards humanity is the only destination for one who can see across the universe and backwards and forwards in time as we can see up and down our own street.  The Big Picture, as it were.  And what are we all in the big picture, folk?  That's right!  Less than microbes for the win.  Manhattan's cold declarations that life is a meaningless phenomenon when compared to the chaotic artistry of the universe is an amazing thing to read.  And frightening in that it is quite possibly true.  But Moore does end up throwing us a bone and does it by celebrating the wonder of individuality from a scientific perspective.  Now that's what I'M talking about!  Rorschach may be the book's black heart and soul, but Dr. Manhattan is it's most brilliant device.  Add a megalomaniacal corporate genius willing to pragmaticly weigh millions of lives against billions with no regard whatsoever for individual rights and you've got the best contrast in a whole book full of contrast.  Lastly, I'll drop some love for The Comedian, who's laughter is the true face of the war heroes we so often celebrate as aculture.  People whose job it is to commit the most vile of atrocities in the name of politics.  I like to think of him as Moore's answer to Captain America.  NOBODY makes a career out of death and comes out squeaky clean with perfect unwavering morals.  Nobody.<br /><br />Look guys:  I got through this whole review without a single political rant!  And with this book just begging for harsh political discourse too.  I heartily accept your applause.  \\"Watchmen\\" was quite literally written as the comic book to end all comic books. Thankfully, that apocalypse didn't happen, but the giant happyface crater is still there for all to see. And if you haven't seen it, then it's about time you did.read comics.

B001FBSMF8|3.0|Such an adequate cover art! Chris Cornell broke his guitar in exchange for Timbaland's synthesizers. Not a bad record though, but it's an album that Timberlake could have made.    I won't refer to any of the records of Audioslave or Soundgarden because this is a solo album. If you like pop music, because I assume you love Cornell's voice, then you'll like this album; even though it has nothing to do compared to the magnificent Euphoria Morning.
0060763280|5.0|One of the most powerful books I have ever read,without going into details,this book helped me realign myself to becoming wealthy and the steps are so easy it's a shame that it's not being taught in schools. The step that Mr Eker shows that it's an inner game of wealth than an outer game and the steps are so easy that anyone can be wealthy,but I will point out wealth also deals with other parts of your life aside from the money/financial aspects.This book changed my life and to Harv, I say,Thank You
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|While it shows it's age (some primitive blue-screen effects in particular) this is a wonderful example of what the Hollywood studio system was capable of in the 50s.  Lush and colorful with some surprising touches of historical accuracy not normally associated with Hollywood of the era (graffiti in the city of Rome) this is a moving and entertaining film.  Star Robert Taylor seems somewhat out of place with his flat, contemporary line delivery early in the story, but he steps up his game when the drama calls for it.  The star of the show though is Peter Ustinov who is mesmerizing as Nero.  His brilliant performance is enough to recommend this movie.  Technically, the film could stand some of Warner's Ultra Resolution magic, but all in all it is a glorious and beautiful high def transfer of a milestone film.
B00003CXA6|1.0|There are two run time versions of this movie.    This listing had it at 261 minutes which I have only seen on TV and has some interesting added material to the 254 minutes length of the origional release.    As I had purchased a 254 minute length DVD years ago I was disappointed to get another 254 minute version on this order. I didn't want 2 of the same length.    It was only 8.99 so not worth sending back.
031606792X|5.0|When my mother first said that Book 1 \\"Twilight\\" was a great read, I was intrigued, and right away, I fell in love with the characters.  Edward, Bella, and their families are so full of heart and layers of story.  \\"New Moon\\" was very heart-wrenching yet also very touching.  \\"Eclipse\\" had so many great moments of revelations and laughter that it was yet another amazing read, yet especially the ending left you knowing there was MORE story that had to be told for the saga to be complete!  So finally I read, \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" and I absolutely love this novel, and hope very strongly that they will add this to the movies already planned.  The fourth book brings everything all together, and ties up everything amazingly.  Even as there are hints of more story that can still be told... Here's hoping!  :)    I realize that a lot of people either love it or hate it, and of course everyone has a right to their own opinion.    I am not always moved to post reviews, but I wanted Ms. Meyer to know that my mother and I both found this to be our favorite book of the four, tied of course with the first one, \\"Twilight\\" which began the journey.    The plot is a very intricate and creative one that like many fiction/fantasy/supernatural novels, asks the reader to remove thoughts of the \\"impossible,\\" and embrace the realm of, \\"Well, what if this was really possible?\\"  Once a reader does that, one can fully immerse themself in Twilight's world, and see how the author perceives her world.    Edward and Bella's love story takes you on a roller coaster ride, right up to the final pages of Breaking Dawn, where even the most impossible-seeming challenges can be faced together through the grounding force of their love for each other, and that of their families.    The passionate cutaway scenes were very well done, leaving it up the reader's imagination.  Even if more had been shared on it, I believe it would work either way though.  A good love story often incorporates two people sharing the depth of their love, where love is as it should be seen as a beautiful expression of that.    Breaking Dawn is a beautiful addition to the Twilight series, and answered many unanswered questions from Book 3: Eclipse.  The saga would not be complete without it.    Hence with all the movie magic that has already been achieved and no doubt more to come, I am hopeful that a way could be found to facilitate Renesmee's character, so that one day Breaking Dawn will join the others on the big screen.    The Twilight movies could work as a trilogy... but having read Breaking Dawn... there is at least one major character whose story would not be completely realized without it, let alone other questions that Breaking Dawn ultimately answers.    For this reader and her mother, we loved Breaking Dawn.  She's just finished re-reading the whole series for the fourth time, and looking forward to reading them yet again.  We would both recommend all the books in the series, and especially the fourth.    Ms. Meyer, thank you very much from both of us for bringing the Twilight series to we the fans!!  And here's hoping that someday you might consider penning a continuation for Jacob and Renesmee, for surely there's more story yet that can be told.  We can only hope so for the future.  All the best!!  :)
006082543X|3.0|I was a bit taken aback when I received the book and found it was  done in the comic book genre.  I have decided to send it to my grandson for Easter.  I am certain that he will enjoy this book.  He is and always has been an avid reader since he was a little boy.    I'm sure it was my fault for not reading the entire review so I would know it was done in the comic strip way.    I am certain it will become a collectible edition oneday.
0375842209|3.0|The Book Thief was a good book and it was interesting to read about WW2 from the point of view of an everyday German - especially ones who were Jew sympathisers.  Death narrating the  book gave it an interesting angle. The end however was so sad that it spoilt the book for me. I normally don't cry and at the end of this book i sobbed my heart out.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I worked as an extra in this movie. I was the bartender on the right side of the screen where Harry Carey Jr. fires a shotgun blast toward the ceiling in a crowded bar. The movie is very good and was more or less lost in the shuffle after the Karate Kid franchise ended. Ralph Macchio does a very good job of miming his finger synching to the guitar licks. This film has a story that stays interesting throughout. It should be acceptable for teens and older audiences. With the current interest in vintage music and cars this movie will find many new fans.

0143038095|4.0|Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club is one of the most relatable novels I have read. It follows the relationships of Chinese women and their grown daughters as they struggle to find their places in the world. Each of these women tell stories from their past. We see what each of the mothers went through in China and why they came to America and we see what the daughters have gone through in their lives as well. These stories draw the reader into very relatable stories highlighting love, relationships, purpose, and understanding, just to name a few. Many of the stories involve misunderstanding, especially concerning the mother-daughter relationship. This novel is powerful, entertaining and touching all at the same time. I highly recommend it.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Don't mind the bad rewviews.  This is one great action flick!  Sure there isn't a Shakespearian story here, but this movie is not trying to be Hamlet.  It is fast paced, fun and entertaining.    See it today.
B00005JLKN|4.0|This installment is an updated version of the \\"Manhunter\\" story, very close to the way it's told in the novel, but given a little Hollywood-style beefup for movie audiences. Some people have complained about Ed Norton being cast as Will Graham, and while there is a side of me that agrees; he doesn't come off as the homicide detective he supposed to be, at least not right out of the gate, he does grow on one as the detective he is supposed to be. He is a good enough actor, just not the type who comes off as what he is cast as. Maybe this is intentional(?).<br /><br />\\"Red Dragon\\" is populated with bigger cast names than its counterpart, and where this makes it more marketable, the star-appeal diminishes impact of the script, which, by the way, still,  is actually a very good one. The viewer sees how Graham caught Lecter (although it clashes with everyone's favorite, \\"Manhunter;\\" the stories don't match), and this brush pushed him too close to the edge. Jack Crawford convinces him to take part in a current investigation, only as a fringe participant, but we all know, it goes way further than that.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes (I never knew until recently his name was pronounced \\"Rayf\\") portrays Francis Dolerhyde as a sympathetic character, one tortured by his inner demons, conflicted, as he is ultimately compelled to hurt someone he actually cares about. This version of the story tells a little more about his past, and why the references to teeth are such a vital part of the story. He was one very sick individual, one who could not function in any society as he was for very long.<br /><br />Emily Watson is so convincing as blind ladyfriend Reba; some folks who went to the movie actually believed she was really blind. She is a very kind, trusting  lady, one who killer Dolerhyde went the distance to not harm, despite his raging compulsion to do so. This story covers the back story between them, how their relationship develops, and how his inner conflicts push him to the brink.<br /><br />Of course, I can only speak for myself, but having read the books \\"Red Dragon,\\" \\"The Silence Of The Lambs,\\" and \\"Hannibal,\\" I am speaking from my own viewpoint; these are three very good movies which convey the crux of the stories in cinematic form, with a solid faithfulness to their origins. The only changes are instances where the film makers didn't think events and/or characters would hold up on screen. The ending of this one, and the ending of \\"Hannibal\\" have been substantially altered, but it was all done for the sake of the end justifying the means.<br /><br />So, in closing, I have exhausted the Thomas Harris/ Hannibal Lecter saga, I went the distance to give my opinions of a true \\"Love it or Hate it\\" series.<br /><br />I think the whole thing is excellent. Ta-ta,<br />\\"H\\"only speak for myself, but having read the books \\"Red Dragon,\\" \\"The Silence Of The Lambs,\\" and \\"Hannibal,\\" I am speaking from my own viewpoint; these are three very good movies which convey the crux of the stories in cinematic form, with a solid faithfulness to their origins.

0312539517|4.0|I decided to read this book because I'd read Jeffrey Archer before, and I'd enjoyed it.  I'd never heard of George Mallory before, or his quest to climb Everest.  This book proved to be a learning experience.    Paths of Glory is the story of George Mallory's life, from childhood to his death on the slopes of Everest.  But it's not a biography, or even really biographical fiction.  It's the story of George Mallory's obsession with mountaineering, and where it took him.    Archer has researched Mallory's life meticulously (and lists Mallory's grandson, George Leigh Mallory II, in the acknowledgments page of the book).  After finishing the book, I was interested enough to do some quick research of my own, and while I can find many things that Archer left out, I cannot think of anything that Archer got wrong.  Archer seems to want to memorialize Mallory with this book; he is certainly of the opinion that Mallory reached the summit of Everest and was headed down when killed, even as he admits that there is no way to prove one way or the other.    Paths of Glory was a gripping read.  I think it helped that I wasn't familiar with Mallory prior to reading it, so that I really didn't know what was coming next.  I was eager to learn of the fate of each of Mallory's companions, just as I wanted to learn of his wife's reaction to his death.  Most of all, as I mentioned, the book made me want to learn more -- a greater compliment I cannot give.
1594481717|3.0|I wanted to like this book because I agree with his premise.  He states that the likely next evolutionary step is for civilzation to revere the conceptual as opposed to the industrial or agricultural.  And those who don't get on board will be left out in the cold as that which can be programmed (i.e., anything logical and linear) is digitized or outsourced.  But, a primary domain in which all this evolving occurs is business.  And business DOES rely on logic and is still run by what he calls L-directed people. I'm not so sure that they will run to find a labyrinth on which they can walk or a laughter club like the one he found in India, as he suggests.  The book is a fun journey into the now-dated concept of whole brain thinking (published i 1984, William Morrow.) If hemispheric thinking concepts intrigue you, this book is a good review or introduction.
0312370849|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a very long time.  I just couldn't put it down.  Well written, easy to follow even though chapters bounced back and forth.  Great characters and the story line so realistic and, of course, sad.  Can't wait for another book by this first time author. Joan

1400032717|4.0|Aside from the \\"language,\\" I loved this little book.  Ostensibly, it's about a dog named Wellington getting killed with a garden fork and a boy named Christopher who sets about trying to discover who did it. There's much, much more to the novel than this minor mystery, however, and Mark Haddon manages to tell a captivating tale while enlightening the reader about how the mind of an autism person works.<br /><br />Christopher has a form of autism called Asperger, and his way of greeting those he loves (a modified version of the \\"high-five\\"), his groaning and/or yelling when uncomfortable, his extreme dislike for yellow and brown, and his inability to decode nonverbal messages are but a few of the myriad of things I learned about. One of the most memorable passages, to me, was one in which he describes a pastoral theme and the cows grazing there. Amazing.<br /><br />About the story itself, Wellington's demise is sort of a catalyst that gets things started.  Christopher's teacher urges him to write a book about it, something that annoys his father so much that he takes the book away from Christopher and hides it. He finds the book along with some other \\"material\\" that changes his young life greatly.  The adults in Christopher's life are far from perfect; in fact, they're just like most of the human family who do their best to navigate life's pathways as they deal with many of the same themes, including  love, hope, heartache, disappointment, betrayal, trust, and sacrifice to name but a few.

B0009A21R6|5.0|Well, I had an old cassette copy of this back when it was originally released, and I recall that this was the first major album digitally recorded.<br />At the time, even on the less-than-LP standard audio found cassette, my brother and I both thought it sounded dramatically crisper than all other cassettes we had ever heard.<br />Fast forward to the 21st century, and digital technology has progressed to explore the wonders of SACD 5.1 sound, and I was nearly speechless as I listened to an album that sounded quite familiar to me, but had so much more detail and space.<br />This one actually pulls off the nearly impossible feat of making a great studio album sound very much like a full concert experience.<br />Simply incredible, and it doesn't hurt that there is not a single weak track on the album, from the opening tongue in cheek and buzz of \\"Money For Nothing,\\" to the beautiful \\"Why Worry,\\" to the utterly sublime and dark title track, this already killer album gets new life.<br />The thunder roll at the beginning of the title track crackles all around, jumping to the two rear channels, leaving me nearly shell shocked, then Knopfler executes one of the most powerful pieces of guitar work, somehow taking its strength from its gentleness.<br />Trust me, folks, Mark can PLAY, and then you get lyrics so thoughtful and moving as to stand up against nearly anyone else.<br />On a technical note, this is a hybrid SACD, which means you get the best of both worlds with a disk that will allow you to get the full 5.1 surround experience on your home SACD system, then take the same disk and play it on your car stereo, and the standard stereo version is just as good or better than the CD only version of this album.<br />As far as I am concerned, I would give away or sell my old stereo version, then RUN and grab this one instead.<br />Thumbs up to Amazon, too, as they did not surprise me at all by having this in my hands well within the promised week after I ordered.<br />Get it, turn down the lights a bit, then listen, and prepare to be amazed.turn down the lights a bit, then listen, and prepare to be amazed.

B00008RWRN|5.0|Anyone who discusses \\"essential\\" rock albums will nearly always mention \\"Machine Head,\\" but I was unaware that Deep Purple also had a quadrophonic mix in their vaults, just waiting to be put on a SACD.  So, when I finally bought a full SACD/DVD-A system, I bought this, and I was simply blown away.  Yes, there is the ever popular \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" but to be able to exploit the huge sonic advantage and space of a 4.0 sound version of an album I had for years listened to in plain vanilla stero was a real treat.  The bonuse of buying this hybrid SACD version is that, unlike with DVD-A, you are not confined to your high end system, forever unable to listen to it on your car CD player.  No, this version will play on your surround system at home, then you can take the same disk, and play it in your car stereo on the way to work.  You get the best of both worlds.  There was a minor hiccup, with USPS losing the initial shipment, so I called Amazon, and they sent another, with it in my hands days later.  Outstanding response time and service!
0307269752|4.0|This book has become enormously popular and it's easy to see why. After a slow start in which the author introduces the main characters and sets the scene, we are plunged into a fascinating investigation of a crime, or possible crime, committed 40 years in the past. The heiress of a wealthy industrial dynasty in Sweden has disappeared. The old scion of the family hires an investigative reporter to make a final attempt to find out what happened to her. He in turn teams up with a young investigator, (the girl of the title) who possibly has Asperger's Syndrome -- at any rate, she does have a photographic memory and an unbelievable talent at computer hacking. Together, they peel back the onion layers, gradually revealing the terrible truth.<br />Some observations: having lived in Sweden, I wondered how many foreign readers got references to previous Swedish financial scandals -- Ivar Kreuger the Match King -- and political crises -- the Palme assassination, the Ebbe Carlsson affair. There are references to the Wallenberg family, which controlled a large portion of the Swedish economy for many decades. It would also help to have a working knowledge of Astrid Lindgren, the beloved author of Swedish childrens books like \\"Pippi Longstocking.\\" Perhaps it doesn't matter but it certainly helped me read the book knowing some of the places described and with a rough idea of Stockholm and Swedish geography.<br />I was amused by the fact that the journalist, Carl Mikael Blomquist, is sentenced to three months in prison for libel. First, in the United States, libel is a civil, not criminal matter. I read on one website dealing with the First Amendment, the following:<br />\\"Fewer than half of the states have criminal defamation statutes. Some of those laws, though still on the books, have been invalidated by court decision. Even in states where criminal libel laws exist, prosecution under those statutes is rare.\\"<br />But the prison is like a holiday camp. Blomquist is allowed to keep his laptop and carry on with his work. He himself looks back on his prison term as a kind of stress-free rest period. That would never happen here.<br />The ugly side of the Swedish nanny state is demonstrated by the treatment of Lisbeth Salandar, the youthful investigator, who is a ward of the court and remains under the control of a state-appointed guardian well after she becomes a legal adult. How is this possible? Only in a country which gives the state such power over the individual, on the grounds that it is \\"for his or her own good.\\"<br />That brings me to the next point: so many Swedish mysteries seem to have sick, perverted, violent, disgusting acts of sexual violence at their heart, and this is no exception. Does this reflect the traditional, uptight, repressed national character.?<br />I think the depiction of one particular act and the victim's reaction to it is very unrealistic.<br />I enjoyed this book but I found the last 50 pages a severe anticlimax so I'm only giving it four stars. But I acknowledge that Stieg Larsson knows how to tell a good story - definitely an above-average mystery/thriller.op and carry on with his work.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been having to shy away from playing games online recently due to severe hand pain, in my wrists and on the top of my hand.<br /><br />When I heard about the g13 i thought maybe I should just give it a try and and see if I can get back to playing games (something I haven't done seriously in about a year).<br /><br />So when the package came, I got excited, booted up Call of Duty and started playing (along with my new GameCon Headset) and wow, it was very comfortable, my fingers weren't all over the place and I actually got to play for a good while without my hand killing me.<br /><br />One great thing about this pad (besides the ergonomics) is the profiles for different games, which enables you to play the game in a much more logical way.<br /><br />I've tried similar devices in the past, and usually I don't end up using them more than 1 or 2 times tops (wasting the 30-40 dollars typically spent), that's not the case with this pad (thankfully, at this price you don't want it to be regulated to some dark recess in your room) this pad just keeps getting used.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want a more comfortable way to play a game, I recommend this pad, if you have problems with the top of your hand, I recommend this pad.<br /><br />This and your mouse are all you need to play any game, no more moving your hand around to hit different keys. The only downside is you do have to get used to your new locations (for the keys) this does take some time.<br /><br />Any game who has been gaming for anytime has their keyboard layout ingrained in their head so when you need to steady a shot or increase speed, you know what to push and where, even in the dark, with this pad your response time will decrease for the first few uses, but after a couple of days you will have this memorized for your favorite game.<br /><br />Another benefit, if you play FPS's is you can just make a default profile for certain keys, and then keep that structure present on all your other games.<br /><br />Then the only difficulty is when you play an odd game that requires some special key press to maybe pull up a map or use an item in a way not typical of most games. (then I recommend checking out a default profile, see if it works for you, then switch over to playing your custom setup and see which is better)<br /><br />Bottom line, worth owning and using.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I admit to being sort of set in my ways when it comes to certain things.  One of those happens to be the warm and comfortable security blanket that is a well-established personal control scheme for a PC game.  When you've played something one way for a long time, it's hard to step outside of that and try new things.  Which is not to say that I've been unwilling.  I tried, for the sake of simple curiosity, the software that allowed me to play World of Warcraft using one of my Xbox 360 controllers.  That was fun, but hardly practical.  I tried, for the sake of better understanding a certain sub-culture in the game, being a clicker/mouser.  Neither of these were serious experiments, I knew going in that I'd be right back where I started -- left hand covering the whole of my keyboard, right hand on the mouse.<br /><br />I can't say that the G13 has changed that basic 'stance,' what I can say, is that it makes your left hand (sorry, lefties, I agree there should be a model better suited for you as well) far more efficient than it ever could be on a standard keyboard.  As a direct result, you are more efficient as a gamer.  The bells and whistles are all well thought out.  Backlit keys for ease of use with the lights on or off.  The LCD display showing a user definable range of relevant information in or out of game.  The relative ease of assigning different functions to different keys.  The quality form and function of a well designed product, at least for my hands.<br /><br />There's a lot of talk about 'skill' in a game like WoW.  I would agree that some people are just more naturally 'gifted' than others.  Your average member of Death & Taxes, Nihilism or Nightmare's Asylum (back in the day) was probably 'better' (and I use quotes because we're just talking about a computer game here) at making their class work for them than most casuals.  What really can and does bridge the gap between the skilled and supposedly unskilled, however, are efficiency and understanding.The G13 will absolutely provide the former.

B001CTDH58|3.0|\\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\"  combines live action and CGI technology in a movie that dog lovers will enjoy.<br /><br />When a stylish chihuahua named Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore) is misplaced by a careless dog-sitter (Piper Perabo), she must find her own way back to her pampered Beverly Hills life.  Basically a canine road trip, the film shows Chloe unexpectedly tossed into the non-indulgent real world as she tries to get home.  She's helped by a German shepherd, Delgado (voice of Andy Garcia), and a posse of new dog friends, while Papi (voice of George Lopez), Chloe's ardent admirer, sets out on a mission to rescue his beloved.<br /><br />The movie is silly but offers lots of laughs, most of them visual -- chihuahuas wearing sunglasses, a tribe of singing chihuahuas, assorted tricks, and muzzle-replacement animation that gives the illusion the dogs are mouthing words.  Disney has had great success through the years with dog stories such as \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" and \\"101 Dalmatians,\\" and this one, though not on par with those classics, is fun.  Kids will probably enjoy seeing Chloe decked out in foolish outfits her owner thinks are chic.  Other voice talent is provided by Placido Domingo, Edward James Olmos, Luis Guzman, and Cheech Marin.<br /><br />Bonus features on the Blu-ray edition include deleted scenes, bloopers, and featurettes on training the dogs and the voices behind the dogs.

B001EO748M|1.0|I love reading/ studying the Tudor history. Elizabeth was a beautiful, albeit often inaccurate, representation of this era - which made it quite  enjoyable. The Tudors was not only inaccurate, but a tasteless representation of the story. To be fair, I could not watch to the conclusion. Maybe it got better?
0439023483|5.0|If I begin to rant and rave like a madman, please excuse me for I happen to be very, very upset for having read this book right now. Let me explain. I bought The Hunger Games a while back and put it on my TBR pile (which is admittedly huge). Having finished second round revisions yesterday, I decided to treat myself and read a little before going to bed at 12:30. First mistake. I am a fast reader but it wasn't til 4AM that I finished the book. There were sections that were so intense I had to reread it right then and there. Second mistake, I drank a huge glass of water before starting. Even though I had to pee really badly, I could not put the freaking book down and go to the bathroom. I can't believe I risked a bladder infection for this book. But then again, I can't believe how awesome this book is.    And that goes to the crux of why I am so raving mad that I read this book right now. Cause when I got to the end of the book, it said \\"End of Book One\\" and I had no Book Two to immediately begin reading. And that is absolutely killing me. It is exquisite agony that keeps me thinking over and over about pertinent parts of the book. I am amazed at the skill and tortured by the wait. I desperately wish I had not read it until the whole series was written so I could read them back to back. But I also wish Ms. Collins would hurry up and write as fast as possible so as not to hold me hostage by her world much longer. My most desperate wish is one I think all writers have when they read a book they love. I wish I had written this book myself. I wish I had created this world so I can control the outcome of these characters.    For those of you who may not know about this book, I'll give you a short synopsis. Ms. Collins has created a dystopian Utopia where twenty-four teenage contestants representing their districts are forced to compete in the ultimate Survivor show. You must kill the other contestants to win. The rules? There seems to be only one rule - make it entertaining. It reminds me of that great scene in The Gladiator where Russell Crowe comes out and kills ten men in a matter of seconds and the crowd is stunned silent. He turns to them and shouts \\"Are you not entertained?!\\" Oh yeah! The producers of the show don't like it when contestants aren't killed daily so they do dangerous things to add to the suspense and keep their audience entertained. The hero of the book is Katniss, a poor girl with mad hunting skills, from the poorest district, whose little twelve year old sister's name is pulled from the lottery. Katniss knows her sister cannot survive and volunteers to go in her stead. And from that moment on, the book takes you on a roller coaster ride that you physically can't get off until it rolls to a satisfying end. Except it isn't satisfying to see that there are more books to read but they are not yet published.    The sequel is out in September. I seriously can not wait!

By that I mean he does not overload you with commentary, you actually get to watch the movie with him. And it's done in with a good dose of filmmaking knowledge, storytelling expertise and his wonderful sense of humor.<br /><br />The 2nd Disc has a mesmerizing historical documentary of William Wallace and the beautiful country of Scotland that will make anyone with a slice of Scottish descent--proud. Screenwriter Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson also contribute to the documentary narrative.<br /><br />Then there's a nicely updated version of the Making of Braveheart with archival interviews and a detailed interview with Screenwriter Randall Wallace that is enlightening.<br /><br />For me this Special Collector's Extended Edition is a classic...a classic without CGI effects...ah...those were the days. From a personal record of theater viewings that has never been matched by any release since, as well as wearing out two video tape versions, the LOTR series proved that it is best to wait for the commentary extended DVD and this is well worth the wait and another Award in the best DVD of a Movie Classic category.
0743297334|5.0|What am I going to read next to top this?<br /><br />That may be your first thought as you silently absorb the last lines of this superlative novel. It sure was mine. As with \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" this is one of the greatest debuts of any novelist and a modernist masterpiece. However, unlike \\"Portrait\\" this is not a bildungsroman. The closest Hemingway ever had to a Stephen Daedalus is Nick Adams and he is forever relegated to the short stories. From this novel going forward all the main characters are going to be the adult Hemingway and his experiences, albeit with a tagged on name.<br /><br />Twain, whom Hemingway regarded as the greatest American novelist, is a clear influence on the breezy travelogue prose here. I'm reminded of of the kinetic stagecoach experiences of \\"Roughing It.\\" If Twain sounds old remember that Hemingway was much closer in time to Twain than we are to Hemingway. Twain died just 16 years before the publication of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" when Hemingway was 27 years old. However, I sense impressionism was also an influence in the simple broad brush he paints with when describing landscapes. In fact, I know it was via his autobiographical \\"A Moveable Feast.\\" This is what informs his Zen style. A river, some trees, a patch of strawberries growing on the side of the mountain...you're in an impressionist landscape once they hit the Spanish countryside.<br /><br />It is in this effortless prose that you go cruising right along into the Paris of the twenties, fishing in Basque country, and fiesta in Pamplona. Be prepared also to drink, drink, drink. It's Prohibition but we're not in protestant America, we're in the greatest city of a continent that has been drinking for thousands of years.<br /><br />Twain influence notwithstanding, this no freewheeling jaunt of quaint misadventures sprinkled with Southwestern humor. We're in the post-WWI, post-Spanish influenza (which killed vastly more souls than the war) years of modernism and that means godless ennui, absinthe, and the Lost Generation: arty expats saturated with drink and (self-inflicted) heartache in Paris.<br /><br />Some reader commented \\"I don't get it.\\" You're not supposed to \\"get it.\\" If you want to \\"get it\\" go read a Tom Clancy novel. This is about poignant irony - a high class flapper slut and a castrated vet in love with each other but forever apart. This is about wanting what you cannot have and dealing with it in one of two ways: the WASP-y approach of repression and stoicism (Jake), or the emotional way by drinking yourself stupid (Mike) or imploding and hurling yourself at others (Cohn). This is a bitter Je ne sais quoi ode to the unconsummated longings of expatriate Americans and Brits in 1920's Paris and it's not meant to be understood, simply experienced. Happy endings are impossible here.<br /><br />But the characters' sexcapades and drinking are only the story - the rest is the poetry of Hemingway: the river, the Basques on the bus, the festival of San Fermin and of course the bullfights. Because Hemingway is so associated with the bullfights you expect the running of the bulls to be a long descriptive event in the novel and it's a nice surprise when it is not. Jake, the narrator, is hungover and wakes up late and watches it from the balcony of his hotel then goes back to bed. When they run again he sleeps through it. Whatever your preconceptions are about Hemingway it won't matter - everything in this book reads fresh and new and the prose is effortless and flows like the wine in the bota bags.<br /><br />The closest Hemingway ever came to an artistic manifesto can be found not in his \\"iceberg analogy\\" interview with the Paris Review, but in the following quote from him:<br /><br />\\"All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you; the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse, and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was. If you can get so that you can give that to people, then you are a writer.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is a classic example of the above. It strikes a wonderful balance between the drama of the characters and their settings. Their desires play out to a backdrop of clinking champagne glasses in Paris, they're given a brief reprieve in the fishing interlude, then take off on a rocket sled during the pagan revelry of the fiesta which assumes a lurid dimension when things all start to go the hell.<br /><br />If you read this book mentally pack your bags because you're going on vacation from Paris to Spain with five friends. This will forever be in my top ten list of favorite novels.eather was. If you can get so that you can give that to people, then you are a writer.\\"    \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is a classic example of the above. It strikes a wonderful balance between the drama of the characters and their settings. Their desires play out to a backdrop of clinking champagne glasses in Paris, they're given a brief reprieve in the fishing interlude, then take off on a rocket sled during the pagan revelry of the fiesta which assumes a lurid dimension when things all start to go the hell.     If you read this book mentally pack your bags because you're going on vacation from Paris to Spain with five friends. This will forever be in my top ten list of favorite novels.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I highly anticipated the return of Supernatural after the cliff hanger we were left with on Season Three. So far [there's still a couple more episodes of season four which have yet to air] this season has not been disappointing. From the beginning, with Dean escaping from Hell, to this raging war between the angels and demons, this is one action packed adventure and thrilling ride to be on. I have watched this show from it's debut, and it just keeps getting better. I don't want to reveal too much information for those who read this and have not watched SPN, and I also can't comment as much as I'd like because the season has not yet finished. However, I couldn't wait 'til it's completion to fill out a review for it, and I have definitely put this box set on Alert so that I know immediately when it's released this Fall [more than likely]. I can't wait to have these episodes on DVD to rewatch and relive. I highly recommend this show to anyone; this season stands so far to be the best of SPN yet.    Just wanted to add to my review quick: a lot of people seem to be wishing for a Supernatural soundtrack. Here are 2 awesome sites that will give you a list of songs played in every episode from Season One to Season Four. So get to downloading and making a SPN playlist of your own! :)    Edit: I'm so sorry; every time I put the URLs in for the sites, Amazon doesn't show them.. I'm going to try putting them into a comment for this review so check there if you're interested!
B00007KLJJ|1.0|This is the WORST rendition of the numerous makes of the FOUR FEATHERS book. Essentially the film writers took a Pro Imperialism, Pro Britain Intervention in the affairs of an extremely violent Islamic book and made it an Anti war film. The moral of the book is a man who acts a coward can redeem himself and honor his country. The moral of this film remake is that all wars are wrong and that Heath Ledger, the hero, is the only one who gets it.  While the filmography is impressive, it is also EXTREMELY unfaithful to the events themselves. The last major battle of the film actually was a victory and spelled the absolute defeat of the militant muslims of the Sudan, not a  loss as is shown in the film.  For filmography this film receives \\"good.\\" For it's rewriting of a great book, exclusion of major portions of the plot deemed pro-war, and for it's blatant attempt to make a heavily pro-british book into an anti-british movie it receives a resounding rating of  \\"LAME.\\"  I highly recommend the older versions of the film, and the book is first rate.
B0017HRCQU|5.0|With the winning combination of Chris Nolan and Christian Bale, we, the fans of Batman, can now say that we have the best portrayal of the character when both see Bruce Wayne and Batman.  When we compare Michael Keaton's portrayal as opposed to Christian Bale, Keaton was not able to bring out as many aspects of Bruce Wayne that Bale did.  The same can also be said when fans want to comare the 2 actors portrayal of Batman.  Many thanks to Chris Nolan for resurrecting and saving The Batman Legacy after the humiliation it suffered with Joel Schumacher!!
0765348780|5.0|Erikson is doing something extraordinary with this series! Gardens of the Moon represents to me one of the most definitive, armor clad 'foot in the door' novels this genre has ever offered. This novel interweaves story lines going back hundreds of thousands of years, hints at layers and depth which can leave you totally stunned while at the same time delivering an unparalled stand alone story. Don't worry, throughout the series one does begin to develop a more panoptic view of this writhing, tangled epic. I am on Toll the Hounds now and have developed a true respect for this author (as I'm sure you will too).
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I was doing prenatal yoga, and felt like I wasn't getting enough workout so I decided to purchase this DVD.  I had done aerobics before, and this DVD was just right amount of workout.  In the beginning (around 20th week), I sweated just a little bit when I was done with the 40 min workout.  Now, I got used to the program but it's still challenging enough because I've added up few more pounds.  Good workout for thighs.
B0007Y08PQ|1.0|This film is really terrible, almost a self-parody, the humor is crass and silly. I was so bored during the action sequences, I had to force myself to watch them shoot at tinny flying robots.  In the movie theater I couldn't belief this was Star Trek, it's just plain bad.  Please skip it.
0780626966|5.0|I have been a fan of the series ever since the beginning and I think they did a great job putting together all the movies.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|Finally! Fantastic collection of songs. How Life in Technicolor II (easily one of the best songs ever recorded by the band) was not included on the first album is a mystery to me. The original sneak peek LIT intro was far too brief and did'nt go anywhere.     Now I understand why Viva La Vida as an album came up short. Prospekts March and Viva La Vida should have really been one album with Prospekts March accounting for at least half if not the bulk of the songs. Lets ignore the jay-z version of Lost - a marketing gimmick trying to appeal to a hip hop audience.     I don't understand why the band could'nt delay the release of the one complete record till all the PM tracks were done. Perhaps some executives thought by splitting up the collection into two albums  they were likely to extract more money from the fans - and maybe it will. Apparently, the EP version has already been discontinued, and only the Viva/Prospekt combo album will be sold - clever! Going forward, Coldplay would do well to deliver a product that does not compromise the quality of a single album for commercial gain.    As I see it, the  single '5 star' album that could have been ideally put together:    1. Viva La Vida  2. Lost  3. Glass of Water  4. Life in Technicolor II  5. Prospekt's March  6. Rainy Day  7. Cemeteries of London  8. Postcards from Faraway  9. Lovers in Japan (Sun Osaka mix)  10.Now my feet wont touch the ground
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I have been a fan of Garth Brooks for a long time, and I have to say that the quality of this album was fantastic and the shipping time couldn't have been better.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|My daughter wanted the movie as soon as it came out and loved it! She especially liked to digital copy so she could download it to her ipod. Great price, fast shipment.
B00168OINK|5.0|amazin movie, its one of the best to see with your childs  the movement the graphics, the movie, all the story is really good
B001KL3GZO|4.0|Everyone probably already knows how GREAT this album is, so no need to go there. There have been a SLEW of re-issues. TOO many. As far as CD goes, I like the SACD version provided it is played in STEREO only. Two channels, high end equiptment. Not on Mid-Fi houshold garbage with all those extra surround speakers. Thats ok for movies, but music is best played in 2 channel stereo. When this recording was first made, the first few tracks were released at the wrong speed, UGH, that has been corrected on the SACD version. BUT like another reviewer here said, if you play it in 5.1 surround, they added a lot of phoney crap to the mix. Just play the SACD in 2 Channel Stereo on your SACD or Universal Disc Player. BUT the BEST reissue of this gem is on VINYL. The reissued VINYL with the time mistake corrected is HEAVEN. I prefer, In order of audio quality, 15 inch per second reel to reel is best, (only one company makes them these days), then comes 180 to 200 Gram Vinyl, then comes SACD, then CD, which is the lowest quality I will listen to, then comes that HORRIBLE MP3 format. Years ago audio cassette tapes, which sucked, took the place of vinyl, probably because of portability. Now MP3 is taking the place of first, SACD and now even Red Book CD.s which are done at a 44,100 sample rate. This is sad. The popularity of MP3 is now making CD's become collectors items. I say, if you are not a stereophile with good high end equiptment to play that gloroius VINYL on, then grab the SACD version (it only comes in SACD and not Hybrid, so you must have an SACD player or Universal Disc Player to play it on) and play it on a 2 channel stereo system, or set your mid-fi multi channel gear to 2 channel.   Just thought I'd add this for you stereophiles out there, since almost everyone knows that this is definately one of the greatest albums ever recorded.   Happy Listening
0143036424|5.0|Mr. Johnson keeps his entire tale \\"Real\\" for the reader from beginning to end. He's done an excellent job in creating flesh & blood characters which almost jump off the page at you. Set in a small Wyoming town at the foothills of Big Horn Mountain, Sheriff Walt Longmire sets to the task of solving two murders whose origins date back to the rape of a young handicapped Cheyenne Indian girl. Four boys were convicted & given suspended sentences for the crime. There's a slight underlying current of racial tension between the white man & Indian throughout the story. Much of that is broken by Longmire's friendship with his old Cheyenne sidekick Henry; as well as Longmire's relationship with the Cheyenne. The story is peppered with sarcastic humor. Personal lives & struggles are interwoven nicely with the mystery.<br />The title seems a bit of a mystery until the last couple pages. If you think of how revenge is best served, you'll then understand the title.<br />If there's one drawback it's that the author isn't always clear about whose speaking in a dialogue between two people. But, that's minor. Longmire is a character who has since been developed into other books & that's a good thing.
0061139378|3.0|First, I should clearly state that I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan; however, I did see the movie version of Coraline first. Surprisingly enough, I found myself agreeing with another reviewer here: I actually liked the movie version a little better, simply because it really does feel more complete.     Although I would not say this is automatically a detriment, Coraline is told in fairy-tale format, meaning that information not strictly necessary to the plot is not present. Why did Coraline's famliy move? Why did the \\"other mother\\" come to exist? More importantly, what does she want? These are all questions the movie attempted to answer, but are not raised in the book.     Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great book for younger kids. It's creepy, and appeals to their \\"fantastical\\" side. However, for older readers looking for more explanation than the book gives, I'd recommend they try the film version.
B000001F46|5.0|KISS has been bad mouthed too much. A bunch of slackers?  Listen to \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\". It's musicianship par excellence.
0545128285|3.0|I expected Harry Potter, but that is not what I received.  I received basically a nursery rhyme book with commentary.  Thank goodness it was a quick read, but all it left me was disappointed.
B000001FBW|5.0|This is, to me, one of KISS's finest releases. As I've grown up I've heard too many people bad mouth KISS and I call these people \\"musical snobs\\". They tend to listen only to things like progressive rock. I like KISS because they played from the heart. Yes, the music is not be technically superb in most ways but they did have some very original ideas on this CD like the guitar playing of Ace Frehely and the little boy voice- very cute. One of the finer songs on the CD is \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" written by Peter Criss. Peter is a terrific drummer. He's no Carl Parlmer but then Carl Palmer was no Peter Criss. If you like hard rock and want to add to your audial history from that repertoire then you may just want to get a hold of this CD.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I'm new to Ray L., but I'm so glad I found this CD. The songs are just beautiful. What a great voice.
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|I had a persistent thought that Madeleine reminded me of someone and I just couldn't think who it was. Then it came to me recently when I heard that Blossom Dearie had died. Madeleine has that same sort of fey, wistful and teasing quality in her voice that Blossom Dearie had. From me that's a compliment.    My only quarrel with this \\"bare bones\\" album is that I wish the quality of the musicians who played with her was better, or rather I should say that I wish the musical styles of the backup musicians were more varied. Some real serious jazz piano and bass might contribute to some of these songs. If it was her choice to be so limited, or her producer's, I'd say explore a bit more. She has the voice to be able to hold her own with the best, and can only profit from the collaboration.
0312360266|4.0|My friend told me to read it, from the moment I started I felt strong curiousity of what was about to happen. Throughout the whole book there is suspence, excitement, romance, conflict, and friendships. The mother-daughter team truly do a great job on both sides of the story; a teenager going throught changes and the adults doing what they can or in the case of her \\"step-loser\\" doing the selfish things. Yes, it is slightly predictable but also very mysterious, the authors leave it open so anything can happen. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I belong to a gym and supplement my workouts with this and a few other DVD's.  I have to say this is a great workout.  Jillian does not disappoint.  You will see results if you do this consistently.
B000A2W1X2|4.0|Like most reviewers, I was hardly bowled over. It was a good movie, period.  There are several wonderful aspects that deem mention. Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane  were outstanding. From their expression to dialogue delivery...everything was faultless.  The cinematography was superb and the editing was brilliant.  Why the four stars? - Because the movie is supposed to revolve around the power of desire both maternal and sexual. The latter is the one aspect I found lacking in the movie. The intimate scenes, in my opinion, seemed like forced and very brief and were not carnal. I could not even find poignancy in them. Physical desire is after all about passion and poignancy. A lot can be achieved without nudity in my opinion.  Sophie's dealings with her daughter, on the other hand were a different story. Very few actors can provide the expression that she did in the final scene with her daughter. The same can be said for Stephen Dillane, in his interaction with his invalid wife.  Somehow the romance between the protagonists stood cold for me. It should have been more pronounced to justify the actions and outcomes that make up the storyline.  The character of the sister in law was one thing that got me thinking. I am glad that the film portrayed women as it did.  In summary - pretty good.
B000001ELB|4.0|Kiss Double Platinum as others have said is the first greatest hits that the band made...  This truly is the definitive greatest hits album...  The following three albums which includes Anton Fig on drums and finally Eric Carr...  Are quite good, but you can see that Kiss was missing something...  Finally when Kiss became their own cover band, between the Creatures ablum and prior to the pseudo-reunion album (Psycho Circus) they clearly lost their way, especially with out the unique Ace sound and Peter's voice...  If there is an ablum that defines the chemistry of the perfect hard rock show band of the 70's, this is it...  You need no other...
B00003CX9W|4.0|I am very satisfied with this product. The only thing that i didn't like was that the content of the DVD Case was only the DVD itself, I expected to be some kind of documentation. The movie was just as I remembered it, when I saw it, for the first time. This is a colectible item, that's why I expected to be more content. The shipping was within the estimated time announced by the seller.
0810970686|4.0|I really should have my son write this review but I can tell you that he finished the entire book in one night. He's 9 and I had to threaten to throw the book away if he didn't come to dinner. He really loves this entire series and now he's got his 7 year old brother reading them too. They can't wait for the next one.
0060763280|1.0|It has been quite some time since I read this but do remember that I thought it was inspiring with positive guidelines for success.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I went and saw this live at the Met in 2008, and it was absolutely outstanding and fun.  Juan Diego Florez has been one of my favorite singers since I saw him in Il Barbiere di Siviglia, and he doesn't disappoint in this.  The DVD is great, and really captures the feeling in the theater.  If you like opera, this is a must-see, in the theater or on DVD.  The singing, acting and staging is all top-notch.
B001G9LV9S|3.0|Though Cat Stevens is a remarkable song writer, the selection of material for the bonus CD was not good. The singing was off his best performances, and was audibly dissapointing. Save your money. If you need to get the original Tea for the Tillerman as a backfill for your collection, just buy the original. You will not be dissapointed, and you will save money.
0143039431|5.0|I am a John Steinbeck lover for sure.  In this wonderful depiction of the horrors the Oklahoma farmers faced during the great dustbowl of the 1930's, I was once again awakened to what a story is supposed to be about.  Too often, we are zapped with this wild tales of one explosion after another, with characters so much bigger than life that they would need the whole universe to survive in.  Here, we see the intimate interactions of those who must struggle to survive in a hostile environment.  We even see those little devilish schemes certain characters assume in order to be human.  (The preacher is the perfect example.)  I was mesmerized by the wonderful way the great novelist paints the mannerisms of each of his characters.<br /><br />The story evolves in a slow and natural way, blazing a trail through the perils the Joad family faces on their journey to California, where hope drives them and keeps them sane.  And even when they complete this trials, other, more severe setbacks are waiting for them in ambush.  It is a story of struggles and greed, of honesty and deceit.  The story finds its way into the deepest chasms of your heart and then tears out a piece.<br /><br />I recommend reading other Steinbeck books first, to savor the best for last.
0345495004|5.0|I am glad that I read The Women before reading Loving Frank. While The Women is about all four of the women in Frank Lloyd Wright's life, LF gives you an indepth portrait of Mamah Cheney, and her love of FLW. This book is much kinder to Mamah Cheney. It is also a much closer look at FLW himself, and how he thought about architechture, and how he would get an idea in his head and could just think for days before grabbing his pencil todraw. There are many in-depth reviews on the book, so I just wanted to add the comparison to another book that is current right now.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I bought this for my 5 year old son, who loves Star Wars.  I grew up watching these in the 80s and recently watched them on VHS tapes.  I bought these DVDs and they are wonderful.  Clear picture, sound, etc.  I'm not sure what some of the bad reviews or complaints are about.  If you want the star wars trilogy to watch at home, this is perfect.
B000002HPT|3.0|So here's the great controversial Dream Theater album that all the band members hate because the record company leaned on them to go more commercial and brought in all sorts of outside producers and even writers.<br /><br />The result is a weird version Dream Theater that we never heard before or since.. lots of pop songs.. lots of piano.. still - despite the turmoil the band went through during the recording of this album, they managed to crank out a few Dream Theater classics.<br /><br />I LOVE \\"New Millenium\\"!  What a freaking great song! Really!  I know the mix is way overcompressed and by the end of it your ears are holding up white flags, but I love it.  Get LIVE AT BUDOKAN on DVD and watch them perform the entire song live.. it really gives the song some breathing room and the mix is far more forgiving on your ears than the studio version.<br /><br />Other standouts:<br /><br />\\"Hell's Kithen/Lines In The Sand\\"<br />where the band really creates this amazing sound that is driven by Derek S on keys.  Don't get me wrong, I love the band that they've become with Rudess on keys but Sherinian is all over this album.  It's interesting to hear so much keyboard driven material on this album.  Also super interesting to me is how Mike Portnoy plays on this album.  It sounds like the suits made him play less like a goofy heavy metal drummer and use some taste.  I like it.  Listen to \\"Lines In The Sand\\" .. Portnoy never sounded classier.<br /><br />\\"Trail Of Tears\\"<br />Although the intro apes Rush's Xanadu so blatantly, the song that follows (yeah all three parts) is again very keyboard-driven prog lite, and DT pull it off like old session pros.<br /><br />\\"You Not Me\\"<br />Yes I said it.  As a huge DT fan I find it endlessly fascinating to hear the band with all these big time producers and writers guiding them.. it's a different sound, but still the song is freaking great, I mean.. so heavy!  and the vocal harmonies are completely tasty!<br /><br />Have you heard the demos for this album (available completely legit through dream theater's own website)?? you can listen to the original version of the song (even alternately titled \\"You Or Me\\") and see how it was a horrid mess before the studio suit dream team called in Desmond Child to chew up and rewrite the whole song.  He made the save, bigtime.<br /><br />Now on to the bad news - the other 6 songs on this album are the worst 6 songs Dream Theater's ever ventured to attach their name to.  Yes, even your beloved \\"Peruvian Skies\\" is a horribly embarrasing and boring song \\"poor poor Vanessa\\" ??  really??<br /><br />I honestly think that if FII were the double album they originally planned with the crappy \\"Raise The Knife\\" and that lame early version of \\"Metropolis Part 2\\" .. Dream Theater might not even have a career at this point.  The band was in turmoil, and I think it's super obvious when you compare the demos for the double album to this ultra-polished single CD, that enlisting the aid of outside writers and producers was necessary.theater's own website)?? you can listen to the original version of the song (even alternately titled \\"You Or Me\\") and see how it was a horrid mess before the studio suit dream team called in Desmond Child to chew up and rewrite the whole song.

0143038095|4.0|\\"The Joy Luck Club\\" is truly a wonderful novel.  On top of the interesting cultural aspects and compelling storyline, the book explores the relationship between mother and daughter in a way that all cultures and generations can relate to on some level.  The mixture of humor and sadness made for a memorable read.  The characters seemed like real people, which made their individual stories that much more interesting and powerful.  Usually it takes me a long time to get really into a novel, but \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" hooked me after a few pages.  The book opens with the fascinating story of June's mother and proceeds to portray a variety of stories that beautifully weave together throughout the novel.  I definitely recommend this book, especially if you've ever had a mother.

I recommend the seller and the book to anyone who would like a lesson in true self inspection.  Mr. Sixx may not be everyone's cup of tea, but he has turned into an inspiration for not only the obsticles he has overcome, but the continuing example of how he lives his life...the help he provides for troubled teens through conventant house...  Well Done!!
B00069A5GE|5.0|Knopfler at his best in a great quality recording. The hi res 5.1 puts you right in the studio. I also liked the video interview showing his studio and his amazing collection of guitars.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Now......you have to remember this is a debut album we're talking about.And even at Chess,the name of the game at the start of the 60's was 45 RPM singles. Well I am sure what's here were single sessions but when put together.........the effect is just hard to describe. If you have ANY doubt that Etta James was the original Queen Of Soul this is completely affirming. She and Aretha are just going to have to share that title;they're both essential. Even if you haven't seen the film [[ASIN:B001P3SA94 Cadillac Records]] and don't know anything,even if semi fictionalized about what was going on inside Etta's heart as she recorded this,what you hear on this album will amaze you.The remastering album,especially for the original music's vintage makes it sound showroom new;Etta's voice is heard in all it's glory. What do I hear when I hear Etta's voice?She's smokey,firey and can plain just attack the mic with a raspy growl.It's also clear and some of most wonderfully phrased singing I can think of.So tell you something you don't know right?I don't know if that's possible so I'll work with my own impressions right now. EVERY song on this album is full of soul-EVERYTHING!The Riley Hampton Orchestra just melts like carmel,setting a nearly impossible standard for all soul music orchestration to come.Now we've all heard the title song;it's one of those undisputed R&B classics that's etched into the subconscious of pretty much everyone. On music such as \\"Anything To Say You're Mine\\",\\"Trust In Me\\" and works of utter beauty such as \\"A Sunday Kind Of Love\\" and \\"All I Could Do Is Cry\\",a tune on which Etta falls into her lowest possible vocal register you hear the whole emotional heart of her talent;the ecstacy and agony,the joy and the pain,the blues and the gospel-she gives you everything,even if there's that unmistakable 50's style R&B \\"swinging\\" style to the arrangment. Etta can also throw down some serious blues too;the assertive sexuality of her spin on Willie Dixon's \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" would be more then proof enough but then you get four bonus tracks;all wonderful uptempo Chess rhythm & BLUES (emphasis on that) with Harvey Fuqua;\\"Spoonful\\",\\"It's A Crying Shame\\",\\"If I Can't Have You\\" and the slow burning \\"My Heart Cries\\". On the album your going to get like minded tunes such as \\"Tough Mary\\" and \\"Boy Of My Dreams\\".I am not exactly sure how much of the emotion in these songs actually came from Etta's real life but either way she always sings a song they way she feels it and that is exactly what you'll get on everyone of these songs.Whatever era of music you happen to be into,or even if you don't have anymore Etta James (and you should probably collect as much of her stuff as you can) this is something you going to want as part of your R&B collection!Dixon's \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" would be more then proof enough but then you get four bonus tracks;all wonderful uptempo Chess rhythm & BLUES (emphasis on that) with Harvey Fuqua;\\"Spoonful\\",\\"It's A Crying Shame\\",\\"If I Can't Have You\\" and the slow burning \\"My Heart Cries\\".

B000VWYJ86|5.0|This movie is a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end.  I felt as if I was being chased not Matt Damon, thats why this movie is so great.  Not its originality, not its special effects, not its acting, (and all are awesome), but what makes this movie and all the bourne movies so great is the fact you feel as if you're in the movie! You find yourself dodging and ducking and other things like that because of the way the movie is presented on camera.  Those who get motion sickness too easily may not enjoy this movie because of the camera moving.  But they do an absolute suberb job of camera work to make this movie as if you're on the run for the entire time, like Damon is.  Bourne Ultimatum (unlike the final Matrix in its trilogy) is the best bourne yet, I felt.  They've perfected the work done on the set, by the 3rd release, and it showed.  A cant miss!
B000025U2V|5.0|Simply Red's initial success with the  and \\"Holding Back The Years\\" is something that caught my attention early in my life. After that most people consider it a bit of a hit or miss affair when Simply Red put out albums.And this tends to be one of the reasons.It was greeted with all the warmth of...well a sophmore slump. The fact is the main difference here is use of style. Wheras the bands debut [[ASIN:B000002IFL Picture Book]] showcased a group who were able to blend soul and songcraft in the finest way possible this album showcases the band working it's way through a set of primarily uptempo tunes with a heavy soul/dance/funk bent;not far at all from the debut but somewhat less mellow. The emphasis on that Stax/Volt/Memphis funky soul influence really showcases itself very well on \\"The Right Thing\\",a single I saw the band perform on David Letterman at the time,\\"Infidelity\\",\\"Suffer\\",\\"Move On Out\\" and the excellent \\"Shine\\". There's also a high octane cover of Sly's \\"Let Me Have It\\" and \\"I Won't Feel Bad\\",the original 45 B side to \\"Holding Back The Years\\" and one of the best songs on the entire album. \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\".....well I love Cole Porter but this is delivered with a little too much sudlty.While there is nothing there that crossed over to the strong extent that the debut album did or would go on to become a standard it's definately an underated album especially if your a lover of Memphis style Brit-Funk.

B000QQFKYE|3.0|Since finishing Mulholland Drive, Lynch has been releasing short film projects on the internet and discovering the joys of digital camcorders. The \\"standard definition\\" resolution that he uses here produces a horribly grainy, gloomy image that looks like a home movie. However, the use of such a cheap and small camera permits Lynch to make a movie more reflexively than ever before.    Inland Empire was never scripted. Lynch supposedly wrote out each scene moments before filming it, with the details of the plot only arising intuitively as time went on. The plotting is absolutely labyrinthine, even compared with already-Byzantine works like Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. Although Inland Empire seemed absolutely meaningless to me on the first viewing, after the second viewing I had worked out the basics of the plot, confirmed later when I read other people's guesswork.    Inland Empire, like Mulholland Drive, treats Hollywood as a great empire of mediocrity, quashing the mystery of genuine creativity in favour of a jellybean superficiality. Nikki, an actress past her prime is desperately worried about falling out of the Hollywood system and is delighted to land a major role that is destined to revitalise her career. She is less thrilled when she hears that the movie is a remake of an unfinished German movie said to have been cursed.    The movie takes a left turn one third of the way in, with the actress finding that she is partially living in the movie she is supposed to be acting in. The initially plush and wealthy false reality slowly degrades over time, so eventually she becomes an LA prostitute, spat out of the Inland Empire that promised so much. The curse has almost crushed her.    However, she discovers that the curse on the movie revolves around the mysterious Phantom, who has entrapped the Polish actress from the unfinished remake of the movie. Nikki ascends a dark staircase, shoots the Phantom four times, and releases the trapped soul.    That is the basic outline of the story, though there are many nuances that there is no room to discuss here. The most memorable image of the movie, the dying Phantom with Nikki's distorted face superimposed, is a shot of unparalleled horror.    The movie, however, is too gloomy (even more so than Lost Highway), meandering and self-indulgently strange for my tastes. Inland Empire is not a case of a relatively simplistic story that has been made unnecessarily complex by self-indulgence. It could not be simplified without losing much of its flavour. However, that flavour is simply something I don't want to taste. Watch Mulholland Drive for something more polished and (to me) more satisfying.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|My husband and I enjoy romance movies. We have a collection that we feel are the best of the best. I remembered at Valentines Day this year that we had talked about trying to find \\"The Great Gatsby\\".  We weren't disappointed- enjoyed every moment.
031606792X|3.0|WARNING - Spoilers Ahead!!!<br /><br />First let me start by saying that I LOVED the 1st three books in this series.  I couldn't put them down and finished all 3 in just over 2 days.  Naturally I immedatly picked up the forth book (I'm a late comer and bought all 4 at once) and again was sucked right in.  The fourth book is sub divide into 3 smaller \\"Books\\" - Human Bella, Jacob, and Vampire Bella. As a woman (and a mother) I love hearing the story from Bella's point of view.  The 1st \\"book\\" (Human Bella) was fantastic.  All of the tension is full-filled with a fantasy wedding and a romantic honeymoon that quickly leads to conflict and tragedy again.  YESSSS!  Then the disappointing stuff rears it's ugly head.<br /><br />Jacob's book is, of course, written from his point of view.  The male point of view is not one of Myers strong points.  This section is the longest in the book and is nesacery to set up the ending but it just seems to drag and drag and drag...I was actually able to put the book down easily and go to bed at a decent time instead of stating up til two in the morning to finish it like I did with the other ones.  On a positive note, the last chapter of this section was really good - SPOILER - I thought Bella was REALLY dead.  Would Edward be able to stay alive for their daughter?  Or would he try to commit suicide again?  And then Jacob imprinted on the baby!  OH MY GOD!  I completely didn't see that one coming even though I knew I should have.  Could Edward and Jacob get along enough to protect the baby from the Volturi (I saw this one coming)?  I had to keep reading!<br /><br />OK, Spoiler done...The third section was good, of course, because it was from Vampire Bella's point of view.  Like other readers, I found it interesting to see this awkward human become not only super-human, but super-vampire.  She's stronger then Emmett, she's more graceful then Rosilie and she can FINNALLY have her Edward.  Plus she has a really cool super power just like the rest of the Cullen \\"children.\\"  And then the tragedy unfolds, they are coming for her baby and they have no hope of surviving.  In true Romeo and Juliet style the star crossed lovers prepare to died to save their miraculous child.  The intenceness was back and I read with blinding speed and TOTAL focus.  The \\"battle\\" was intense and -small SPOILER- I kept waiting for Jacob to run with Ressemsa. I SOOOO wanted to get my Romeo & Juliet ending with everyone dead and Ressemsa running, her tears flowing into Jacobs fur as they disappear into the forest, never to be seen again.  BUT NOOOO - I got Cinderella's (or maybe Snow White's because of the cottage) happily ever after!  Everyone survive and happily ever after begins, forever.<br /><br />SPOILER OVER - I'm not saying that I didn't like the ending, just that I'm disappointed that it didn't end the way I expected.  It left me with a sense of euphoria and did NOT ruin my love of the series as a whole.<br /><br />Over all, I liked the book and would recommend to anyone to read the series as a complete set.ldren.\\"  And then the tragedy unfolds, they are coming for her baby and they have no hope of surviving.

B001TOD92C|5.0|2008 has been offically dubbed the comeback year, the year when dozens of has-been stars seen their careers get a jumpstart and propell them back into the spotlight. Robert Downey Jr. had Iron Man and his Oscar nominated role for Tropic Thunder, Britany Spears finally got that much needed career boost, but the most out there comeback of the year come from Mickey Rourke, who delivers one of the years best performances in the raw, realistic, and heart tugging The Wrestler.<br /><br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was a huge wrestling star in the 80's, with money, fame, and tons of fans. Now almost twenty years later, he is a shell of his former self, body battered and torn, no longer a star, living paycheck by paycheck with every run down wrestling match, the guy is like a walking failure of his glory days. One day, after suffering a near death experience, he wants to put his wrestling days behind him and try to make a 'normal' life.<br /><br />As mentioned before, Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his career, considering this role basically mirrors his own self destructive life. Balancing moments of humor, tenderness, sorrow, and all other emotions inbetween, you actually feel for the guy, feel his pain, and its real, its true, genuine emotion. Then there are the two woman, Marisa Tomei as the strippe Cassidy that Randy has a thing for and Evan Rachel Wood as his angry daughter Stephanie. Both of them deliver great performances as well, Tomei acting sort of like the light of the movie, acting as the perfect counterpart to Rourke, and Wood is able to convey pefectly play her role in a way that dosen't make it just another 'angry daughter' role.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky, known mostly for his surreal, gritty sci/fi flicks gives us the dirt and piles it on, making the scenes so real and alive, you can feel the cold, you can smell the alcohol, and the wrestling scenes are just so bone crushing, so in your face, its almost too much for you to handle. I still have this searing image in my brain of the brutal fight scene near the middle of the film (trust me, you'll know when you see it). The Wrestler is just that movie that really dosen't act like one but an actual experience as you walk through this man's life.<br /><br />For those who have said that this year was a pretty lackluster year for movies, The Wrestler is that one movie that will seep into your skin and truley affect you in a way very few films will ever accomplish.of the brutal fight scene near the middle of the film (trust me, you'll know when you see it).

B00000266S|5.0|One of the all time best 80's soundtracks.  Every song keeps the beat moving and I can picture what part of the movie during which the song is played.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|Thank God for Daniel Craig! James Bond lives on! Best James Bond actor ever, in my opinion. Daniel Craig is pure and real. Casino Royale is our introduction to the real James Bond from his beginnings. The story moves fast and there is plenty of intrigue. For those reviewers who bash the poker game, they're not noticing the nuances of the actors and their exchanges with each other. And I, personally, do not like card games either. My favorite scene involves Daniel Craig and Eva Green's characters meeting each other for the first time on a train. Excellent wit and clever dialogue. If you love the mystery behind James Bond or Jason Bourne -- you will be a fan of this movie, too. The added features bring further understanding to the James Bond franchise and the fabulous 2nd Unit stunts. Highly entertaining!
0316743003|5.0|I am fortunate to be a docent at the largest privately operated air museum in the United States. The Pima Air and Space Museum located in Tucson, AZ is home to around 285 aircraft and one of them is an SR-71 Blackbird.     It is now resplendantly displayed in our Spirit of Freedom Hanger with all kinds of SR-71 artifacts and information (including sound) and raised off the museum floor in a striking manner. For a number of years, we have hosted an SR-71 Symposium where the pilots, RSO's and maintainance people return to form panels over a two day period to relate their experiences with the Blackbird and answer questions about the world's fastest jet aircraft.    This year was one of those years and included in the speaker panels was a gentleman from Lockheed named Peter Law. My wife and I had a chance meeting with him at lunch on the second day and during our chat he asked if I had read Ben Rich's book. (That is the way it is always described) I admitted I had not. He said, \\"You've got to. He tells it like it was.\\"     Peter Law still carries the slide rule that he has used during his days at Lookheed. (This plane was built by slide rule - not computer) and he still has the enthusiasm for what the SR-71 was and what it accomplished, all of which is usually credited to Kelly Johnson, and rightly so.    Johnson was a giant in aviation. He is synonymous with The Skunkworks, that part of Lookheed where marvelous things were done. And through it all, Ben Rich was there for most of it and was eventually Johnson's successor.    Much of what was accomplished at Lockheed was under Johnson's command, however the F-117 was a Ben Rich creation and much of the first part of the book deals with how that came about.    The remander of it deals with the SR-71, the U-2 and other aspects of the Lookheed history while Rich was there. He also makes a number of very telling observations towards the end of the book about military procurement methods and governmental stupidity which are precient and wise.    If you are interested in The Skunkworks and Kelly Johnson, let Ben Rich be your guide through those incredibly interesting times.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Excellent follow-up to Casino Royale! Quantum of Solace is absolutely packed with action -- you have no chance to catch your breath as you join James Bond on another globe-trotting adventure. I love Daniel Craig as James Bond. He is definitely the most masculine, hardest hitting James Bond ever. Pierce Brosnan and the others were all a bit too soft and effeminate. Daniel Craig is all man. Any viewer, male or female, will enjoy Daniel Craig as James Bond. Excellent cinematography and action sequences. I, personally, found Quantum of Solace even better than Casino Royale (which I love, too!).
0439023483|4.0|I loved this bok very much. I thought it was a little boring during the first few pages but then it got very interesting and was action-packed from then on I loved the twists and turns of it. I would definately reccomend this.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|Van Helsing is one of the most over the top action movies I've ever seen. It's got in your face CGI and a ridiculous plot with cheesy acting. But that's what makes it so damn good. Like other reviewers have said who liked it, it's a nod to the oldies with the new technological makeover and it's a helluva lot of fun to watch...again and again. I understand how people don't like this movie. I may seem like I have horrible taste in movies by loving this, but I like a good Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, or The Shawshank Redemption, much smarter, much more mature and provocative works that stay with you for a while. This movie is the kind where I can just relax, not think too much, and just enjoy and adrenaline-filled, visual effects laden, awesome adventure. I thought the production design was super cool, and at least I could tell a lot of people working on this movie put love into what they were doing. Haha I know that sounds so stupid but I thought so. I'm just puttin down my thoughts on this because I don't want everyone to expect and judge this movie because it's not as smart or well constructed as other, better movies. This one is just F-ing fun. Pardon my French.

B00009MGGI|5.0|Ian Richardson plays Francis Urquhart, Chief Whip of British Paliament. The series covers F.U.'s rise to PM and his attempt to maintain his hold on power.<br /><br />F.U.'s character is legendary. He's not exactly a sociopath, but let's just say it takes an incredible amount of manipulation to make it to the top in Parliament. F.U. breaks the \\"fourth wall\\" and talks directly to the audience in this series. His comments and observations are insightful and witty and everything the viewer wants to hear from this incredibly damaged but intelligent man. F.U. is an impeccable  judge of character and has true genius for getting everyone around him to betray themselves.  F.U. is a  true \\"Machiavellian Prince\\" ([[ASIN:1440428034 The Prince]]). The scenes of banter in the House-the amazing oratory skills of the M.P.'s-are particularly good and worth paying attention to.<br /><br />This is straight up one of the best TV programmes you'll see. Riveting and intriguing. Completely original. With only three three star reviews out of 77, it's clear the House of Cards is a winner.<br /><br />If House of Cards inspires you, I'd recommend the very long but intriguing [[ASIN:0140437649 The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Penguin Classics)]] or the HBO series [[ASIN:B000Q66PXE Rome - The Complete First Two Seasons]]. As wily as Parliament is, it doesn't hold a candle to the political intrigue of Rome.

B001HN69AE|2.0|On-line has 70 minutes of the movie, it has everything but the very beginning. You're better off not wasting your money in theaters and just watching it on-line. It's not even worth wasting money to rent it. Sure, I didn't see the whole movie but I saw enough to know that it was bad.<br /><br />  I was a big Dragonball Z fan and I really wish they made more of an effort in starting a movie series. The movie got the quirkiness of the series right but...that's about it.<br /><br />  The movie has horrible costumes, stupid action sequences and bad set pieces. While  Justin Chatwin is just painful to watch as Goku. He's annoying, can't act and he looks like a fan that just played dress up and made a Dragonball movie with his friends. He was a horrible choice for the role. He doesn't even look like Goku.<br /><br />  I was hoping that playing Piccalo would be a break-out role for James Marsters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but that's not the case. He wasn't a bad choice for the role but this movie isn't going make anyone a star. Hell the movie even managed to make Chow Yun Fat look bad as Master Roshi. Yes, he's perfectly goofy as him but while giving a bad performance. His outburst about how he's the great Master Roshi when he's introduced is embarrassing and awkward especially compared to his great work in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br /><br />  The movie is based on the show that was just called Dragonball I should mention. There was no Vegeta, Trunks , Frieza or Cell in that series. Krillin was left out as well even though he was in the Dragonball series.  The show had Goku trained by Master Roshi, looking for dragonballs with Bulma and fighting in tournaments. He also transformed into an ape occasionally. While Piccalo was the main bad guy in Dragonball.<br /><br />  So the movie got some things right but it's still a made for dvd quality film. Goku's ape transformation is horribly done, he just looks like a guy in an ape costume. I thought visual effects have gone further than that. In closing, the Dragonball series, deserved a much better production. If Speed Racer was on worse movie lists of last year, then Dragonball: Evolution definitely will be this year. The movie makes Speed Racer look like Gone With the Wind.ne further than that. In closing, the Dragonball series, deserved a much better production.

Chris' latest album, Scream, certifies that not only is his voice and presence in music is still felt, that he also is willing to try different avenues of approach to his music.    This album has Chris partnering with well known Producer and Rapper Timbaland. While different from Chris' rock origins, Scream brings to the masses a relevant and awesome experience in music that can only brought by Chris amazing vocal talents.     Tracks such as Long Gone and Enemy are two testiments of his wide range of vocal skills. These and all other songs on the album invoke emtions, memories, and thought in a listener just like all of his previous musical entries have whether solo or as a group (i.e. Audioslave, Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog).     Anyone who enjoys Chris' music owes it to themselves to purchase this wondeful album. You'll be treating your ears to a different piece of his musical talent that no real Chris fan should be disappointed by. This album along with his previous albums, solo and group, further proves the message we all have known and that is Chris Cornell is clearly the the finest voice in rock music past and present. His music is immortal.
0060920432|4.0|After years of hearing about Csikszentmihalyi's \\"Flow\\", I finally brought a copy and read it during the flights of a recent trip. The framework work that Csikszentmihalyi laid for enhancing a person's experience in daily life is comprehensive, concise and brilliantly straight forward -- flow, or a state of enjoyment, is attained when a person is deeply focused on an activity in such a way that his sense of time and self(-inferiority) is lost. Csikszentmihalyi also observed that the type of activity that fosters flow usually have a well-defined goal and provides immediate feedback. People who frequently experience flow are those invest their attention (or psychic energy) to such an activity over an extend period of time, over which the enjoyment from the activity and the commitment of the participant form a virtuous cycle, resulting in a continuously deeper and rewarding experience.<br /><br />How rare are those who can find flow in their daily work? Too many of us wander into our careers after series of random choices. When we do feel motivated, it is because of money, prestige, peer-recognition and other equally frivolous matters. How often can we stand in front of a mirror can tell ourselves that we drive to excel in our careers out of pure sense of enjoyment?<br /><br />Flow serves as a wake-up call to us. Every moment not seeking enjoyment out our daily lives is a moment that we willfully discard.
0307454894|5.0|What is the worst secret you've ever kept? Is it worth your freedom? Does pride matter more than anything else?     The Reader is above all else a love story. Michael Berg is a young man who has never been close to anyone in his life except for an older woman he meets at the age of fifteen, Hannah Schmitz. Hannah, seductive, evasive, and complicated, is full of secrets. They have a love affair, however brief, that spans and haunts Michael throughout his life.  Hannah ultimately disappears from Michael's life for 8 years. When Michael finally sees her again he is a young law student and Hannah is on trial for a heinous crime.     Full of eroticism and moral concepts, this story is all-encompassing, breathtaking, a book that you can't put down. The passion Michael feels for Hannah is so vividly described- the way she smelled, the way her body moved, the confidence she exuded. You feel as though you are reading a 30 year old diary of a man and the love he lost as a child. You feel for Michael, drawn into his obsessive yearning, his homesickness for a time when he felt most loved and when he most loved.    Their story, Michael and Hannah's, takes you on a heartbreaking journey with lessons of pride, forgiveness, and guilt. It leaves you wanting to read it again and again. There are many moral questions and thoughts that come up from this book, some remain unanswered. The Reader is disturbing and tortuous, yet simultaneously, it stirs your heart and leaves you hopeful for the magnitude of love and compassion shown in this book. The Reader is indeed a masterpiece.

B001HDO4Z6|3.0|This is a nice collection of songs, out for a limited time only. It is typical Coldplay. What you get here is 3 alternate versions of songs from their Viva La Vida album and an additional 5 extras. What Jay-Z is doing on 'Lost' is beyond me..he single-handedly destroys a very good, melodic song. I am disappointed that the original Viva La Vida album did not include the missing tracks found here (especially the vocal version of Life in Technicolor), and can't help feeling that this is just another way of extracting more money from the true fans. With that said, the songs are strong without being over-adventourous. Fans will love this (as I do), but casual music lovers will get all they want from the 'mother' album. It looses 2 stars from me, simply because I believe that this and Viva La Vida should have been just one album.

He did an awesome job he hit the nail on the head. Marc does his songs his way on his albums this is a soundtrack people of course he has a bigger range and thats what sells his albums this is a movie about Hector Lavoe so he needed to be Hector Lavoe case closed. Two different styles two great singers.
1594481717|5.0|There are so many business books on the market it's overwhelming knowing which are worth my time. So many of them offer opinions on what the reader should or shouldn't do. What puts this book in a category of its own is that after each of the six chapters on skills you should develop are eight to ten pages full of suggested ways to practically do what Pink is suggesting. This is a hand-on, do-able approach. The activities are such that the reader can simply select those activities that appeal to him/her. His premise is compelling and well written. I'll comtinue recommending this book to everyone.
B001Y4AXS0|5.0|It's been a while this season since I saw an episode of this show that met the potential of the first few eps this season. This one, \\"On the Head of a Pin,\\" finally did what a good episode should do:  it developed the characters in meaningful ways and it moved the plot along in a direction that made me want to keep watching for the rest of the season.<br /><br />The episode isn't perfect; I'm still blown away by how weak Castiel's character is made to look whenever he's engaged in a fight. Someone always has to save him--Dean, Sam, Anna--because he usually ends up about to get his soul scrambled by some nefarious character or other. Why? Why make him look so weak when he is one of the most engaging characters on the show? And there's still the whole issue of twisted logic that rears its ugly head and makes me wonder who's keeping track of stuff on this show. But oh, man--there are some really good things happening this year that require and deserve recognition.<br /><br />First of all, and I've mentioned this before, Jensen Ackles has developed some acting chops that really stand out and make me want to keep watching even when the episodes aren't up to snuff.  This young man could so easily get stuck in pretty-boy traps; he's remarkably easy on the eyes and his character has a kind of frat-boy playfulness that might match Ackles' own sense of humor and attitude, but he's got RANGE. He does funny, charming, wicked, sex-crazed, and anguished with skill and believability. But it's with the tortured part of Dean's character that  Ackles really shines. You can see it in the line of his body when he's about to come apart emotionally; you can see it in the flaring of his nostrils as guilt and fear begin to rip at him. He plays Dean like a young man with a moral compass that's fierce and burned into his soul but whose own insecurities and self-doubt eat at that morality and make him vulnerable. Dean feels things intensely, and it's a real trick for Ackles to play him without coming across as wimpy, but the man does it, and he does it with skill and believability.<br /><br />This episode takes Dean into territory that is meant to break him, and at eps' end, he certainly appears to be broken.  I don't want to spoil the plot twists, so I'll say this and end:  even broken and aching for absolution, Dean is a mesmerizing character because of Ackles' performance and his willingness to do whatever it takes to expose Dean's vulnerabilities and his anguish.<br /><br />Sam's character gets developed a bit more, and we discover some things about him that are disturbing. I won't discuss that at length because it's a huge plot twist, and I don't want to ruin the surprise.<br /><br />The whole issue of heaven and hell and angels (both fallen and not) gets developed a lot more here, and it's pretty fascinating to me because I find the whole thing thought-provoking.<br /><br />All in all, and despite some plot probs and my quibbles about Castiel's character, this episode was superb.<br /><br />Most especially, kudos to Mr. Ackles.as wimpy, but the man does it, and he does it with skill and believability.

B001ANYDAO|4.0|In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell seeks to disabuse us of the notion that genius and greatness are predominantly a function of innate ability and IQ. He rightly notes that while IQ is certainly a contributor, it reaches a \\"point of diminishing returns\\" after a while: once people score about 130, IQ becomes less important and \\"intangibles\\" (my term) become more important.     The book, then, focuses on what these \\"intangibles\\" are. Gladwell suggests that things like what income level, culture, and time of a child's birth are important contributors to success, as well as a person's tenacity and agility. As the last of these is the least conventional, think of it this way: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and many other computer masterminds would likely not have distinguiished themselves were they born 10 years earlier (as they would not have been exposed to computers in high-school/college, and would have been in their mid-thirties by the time computers really took hold, likely already in other careers by that point in their lives.)     How does culture matter? Think about the discrepancy between how many days per year American children spend in school (180) versus Asian students (280), and how many more social expectaitons Asian students are borne into? Certianly this will affect academic and other achievement.     Now, I should point out that Gladwell is quite adept at anecdotal story telling and is much less adept at statistical analysis. As such, he could be justly accused of overstating his case (and maybe even finding patterns where he wants to see them, rather than where they exist.) Gladwell is definitely writing for the popular market so anyone wanting good \\"back up\\" of his arguments may find themselves disappointed by his cherry-picking of examples.    That said, Gladwell's book contains some interesting and provocative ideas, especially for educators and those concerned with education. His last chapter - about the KIPP schools - is a fascinating plea for American schools to infuse more rigor (and quantity) to the educational school year. As a main part of Gladwell's thesis is that how hard one works (and is willing to work) is endemic to one's likelihood of success, we set students up for failure by not expecting them to work as hard as other countries expect of their students.     For a fun read which introduces some interesting ideas, Gladwell's \\"Outliers\\" is a decent book. Those who want a little more scholarly meat may come away disappointed.
B000EJ9VGQ|5.0|Donnie Darko is my favorite movie of all time, no other movie could deliver the interesting characters, complex plot, or intriguing storyline as Donnie Darko does. Not only that, but the acting is superb, especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, he portrays a deeply disturbed character who has visions of the end of the world told to him by a six foot bunny rabbit named Frank. (Note that it really isn't a bunny rabbit, it's just a man in a freaky rabbit costume).  This movie has humor, romance, intrigue, mystery and ingenuity. I dare anyone who has not seen this movie to go out and rent it or buy it. Watch it at least twice (the first time may leave you completely confused), and try and say that you don't love this movie. I have yet to meet someone who said they don't like Donnie Darko.  The movie aside the UMD is incredibly well packaged, aside from the movie itself it also includes the theatrical trailer, complete audio commentary with the writer/director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, extended and deleted scenes with audio commentary for those that wish to hear it, and a Mad World music video. (By the way, a lot of people, myself included, got absolutely addicted to the song Mad World by Gary Jules. Richard Kelly could not have picked a better song to end the movie with.)  The picture quality is great (but then again what isn't off of the PSP's excellent LCD screen?) The only issue I have with the movie (and it's not really the movie itself, but the PSP's design) is that the movie is a little hard to hear sometimes, even with the volume turned all the way up. But like I said, it's not really the UMD, it's the speakers that come with the PSP, they're not exactly the best known to man. This is an easy fix though, as long as you have some headsets or some of the aftermarket speaker systems for the PSP you're good to go.  Overall great movie and great deal for the UMD. Highly recommended for fans of the movie (and anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet.) I mean, who wouldn't want to have the best movie ever made in your pocket?
1881273156|5.0|This book helps you to realize how to express love for your mate in a way that will be effective. It was a difficult lesson to learn that the ways we normally communicate love and appreciation for our partners may not be getting the message across. Dr. Chapman helps you identify and use strategies that will speak volumes to your mate about you true desire to have a deep and intimate relationship. Even if you are in the hard times, this book will help you to see that small adjustments can make those huge problems become smaller. It also helped me understand my own languages so that my spouse, and my family, could understand my own needs easier they express their love for me in a way I could feel it was sincere. Whether you are on the rocks, or in an intimate and growing relationship, this book helps you get to the heart of giving God's love to others. I would also suggest following this up with \\"The Five Languages of Apology\\" also by Dr. Chapman. Then you will really know how to communicate love and mend those barriers in relationships. These Godly principles really work!

B000QGEB12|5.0|I am a sucker for kung fu movies so my assessment of how surprisingly good this movie is, would be less helpful than that of my two friends. Both are usually adamantly against martial arts movies on the premise that they are usually \\"cheesy\\" and/or \\"unrealistic\\". I knew I could soften them up if I could convince them to give this film a chance. Once they submitted and pretended not be enduring it, they quickly surrendered that it was \\"surprisingly good\\" and \\"really entertaining\\". That's the great thing about Stephan Chow; he makes his movies so unrealistic and overdone that you don't ever try to take them seriously; they are just plain ol' entertaining. His films and this one in particular seem to be a perfect hybrid of martial arts, comedy, and fantasy and comic book movies. This movie is not realistic, it is surreal, in a good way, the action scenes are fast, furious and Kung Fu...nny as heck. If you love martial arts or kung fu movies this is a MUST add to your collection, if you are not into them as much, this will be the one film in the genre that will knock your socks off guaranteed! This Axe-Kickin' Edition really kicks AXE minus the \\"xe\\" and add \\"ss\\".

B000286RNY|5.0|The unlikely, yet perfect combination for comedy & sport: Soccer + Kung Fu! Who knew? Although I think Chow's Kung Fu Hustle is a better film overall, I give Shaolin Soccer a 5/5 because I love soccer and I love martial arts. If you like either soccer or kung fu and/or better yet both, you can't go wrong with this movie, it is entertaining from start to finish.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This film is tone perfect.  What amazes me is how authentic it feels, whether we are watching surfers, \\"dudes\\" around the campfire and their girlfriends, the life of a short-order cook and devoted uncle, or two young men falling in love.  It made my heart ache, just like real life sometimes.    Beyond the romantic love story, the film is a testimonial to family love:  kindness, loyalty, tolerance and solidarity.  Without making a too-obvious statement, it delivers the highly political message that gay men have a place in family life and, in some cases, are the anchor for everyone else.  The main character, Zach, never questions the rightness or inevitability of his commitment to his nephew and his sister, and although several other characters talk about his making a \\"choice,\\" we see (and he tells us) that it is a given, not a choice.  In view of the circumstances he faces -- nowhere job, collapsing home environment, impossible future -- he is truly heroic just to carry on.  It is inspiring to see him struggling to find love for himself while meeting all of the standards he has set for himself with respect to others.    Trevor Wright's performance is extraordinary.  He seems so completely natural that it doesn't feel as if he is acting at all.  Since this is the only time I've ever seen him, I can only wonder whether he could bring the same conviction to another role, but he totally inhabits this one.  The subtle ways that his character expresses his affection for the little boy are credible and affecting.  He is very likeable and lovable.    The other performers, particularly Brad Rowe and Tina Holmes, are also excellent.  The happy ending is satisfying and persuasive.
0307269752|3.0|I always approach translations with a high degree of caution. What can be beautiful writing in one language becomes clumsy in translation. After a friend recommended The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I exercised that caution and approached this sprawling almost 500-page mystery with caution. What I found inside overcame any concerns about translation problems. The stories of two central characters are presented separately and then merged, within the structure of trying to solve a forty year old missing persons case. Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist recently convicted of libel, and is heading for jail, placing his periodical in jeopardy while he is absent. The title character, Lisbeth Salander, works as an investigator for a security firm, and uses her prolific hacker skill to find out everything about anyone. Her lightweight body and multiple piercings and tattoos disguise her skills and talents from those unwilling to look beyond appearances. Lisbeth has a photographic memory that serves her investigative role well, but she struggles with personal interactions and in relationship with others. The action accelerates when octogenarian Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger employs Blomkvist to write a history of the company and the Vanger family, provided he also examine and investigate the forty year ago disappearance of Henrik's neice, Harriet. Blomkvist asks Lisbeth to work with him to investigate the case. Along the way, they find violence and evil, and uncover family secrets that Henrik Vanger would just as soon keep quiet. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is Steig Larsson's debut novel, and it will be followed by two others. To the dismay of readers and friends, Larsson died in 2004, so these books will be his first and last.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0015OKWL2|2.0|Pacino - Deniro, sounds like a perfect combination. It didnt work, i almost felt they didnt want to work together either.

045122499X|5.0|I loved this book!  I brought it on vacation to Dominican Republic and so had entertainment for the whole two weeks.  I also saw others reading the same book, including a man reading it in French.    I possibly liked this book even more than Pillars (even though it can be read as a stand alone book and only has vague connections to the original such as ancestors of the original characters and the towns).  There was less technical details such as building and architecture details and more about the characters.  In some reviews I have read, people don't seem to view the characters as very realistic for the time period for their ideas on various issues such as feminism.  This may be true, but it can make the characters easier for readers to identify with and understand their motives and feelings.  I enjoyed very much how the plague was worked into the novel and thought it was very interesting.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Betty / Diane (Naomi Watts) hates / loves Camilla / Rita (Laura Harring), and wants to kill / spend her life with her. We are invited to share the final few moments of Diane's reality / dream. David Lynch reaches his peak of cinematic expression by giving us both the interior and exterior interpretation of the same grim tale. The former view is Diane's innermost hope / desire in the face of utter hopelessness, her last attempt to make things right in her own soul. The latter is Diane's nightmare life in its true form, complete w/ guilt, remorse, and mind-shattering loneliness. MULHOLLAND DR. is perfect from its sleepy start to its unavoidable end. It is a story about betrayal / murder and revenge / suicide. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I always get something new out of the experience, and want to watch it again...

1439102813|5.0|Lisa Genova writes an exceptional first person portrait of a young woman entering into and processing through Alzheimers disease.  For the past 35 years, I have worked with residents that have dementia and alzheimers disease.  What is truly inspiring in this book is the momement when Alice speaks at a Dementia Care Conference.  She speaks about who she is and not just abouat the disease is attacking her. She tells us that she may not remember us tomorrow but what she has to say today is important.  Still Alice reminds us of the human beings we are and the illnesses that attempt to take who we are away from the perspective of those living around us.  To see the life that lives inside of each of us and our strength to be courageous and hold on to who we are for as long as we can is heart felt.  I thank Lisa Genova for writing this book.  I have read it twice in one week and wanted to stand and applaud Alice at the end of her presentation.  Yes it is a novel, yes there are parts that people say were not necessary to the book,and yes, there are some ethical thoughts to consider in this book, but at the end of our lives, we will all have these challenges. Everyone should read this book.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I am a big fan of horror movies and very rarely get scared by them, but of all of the ones that I have seen, Jeepers Creepers is deffinatly one of the scariest. Surprisingly, the movie succeeds in being very scary and creepy just from suspence and the idea of The Creeper. Don't get me wrong, it is gory and gruesome in parts, as the Creeper stalks people and steals parts of their body) but its doesnt need the gory to be scary, it is a scary movie on it's own, the gory bits are juast an added bonus!<br /><br />Brother and sister college students, Darry (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Phillips) are driving home from college to visit their parents for spring break when a mysterious stranger in a big rusty truck with a registration plate BEATINGU leads them on a harrowing car chase and tries to drive them off the road. Soon after this, Darry discovers and terifying chamber of horrors underground and the siblings are thrown into a game of cat-and-mouse with The Creeper, a demon who feeds on fear and seeks out people body parts e.g. eyes, tongue, which it eats to improve itself.<br /><br />Jeepers Creepers is scary, suspenceful and gory and the charactors are unique and likeable. I would highly recomend this movie to fans of the horror genre.
159448385X|3.0|A story about two women's lives that ended up intertwined in the ravages of war-torn Kabul, this book is a heart-wrenching read. It is well-written in that I couldn't stop turning the pages and ended up finishing it in two straight days. I can't help but compare it to \\"The Kite Runner\\" and somehow find that Hosseini's second book lacks a certain punch (or \\"oomph\\", if you will) that his first had. Some of the violent scenes in the book were very difficult for me to read and although I couldn't wait to turn the page as I was reading it, I will not read this book again.    Nevertheless, although I'm not overly familiar with recent Afghan history, the historical component of this book is informative to me. As someone who grew up in a Muslim country, I recognize too well the practices and the viewpoints brought up in the book. The book has served another reminder of just how fortunate I am in my life.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|Child's Play is a brilliant and origional horror movie. It creates a new spin on the slasher genre by having the killer be a childrens' doll (NOT a spoiler, it is known from the very start of the movie that the doll is the killer).<br /><br />Serial killer Charles Lee Ray is chased by the police one night and hides in a toy warehouse. They police follow him in and shoot him. As he dies, he envokes some kind of power by chanting a spell and putting himself into the body of one of the toys - a Good Guy doll. Six year old Andy badly wants a Good Guy dollso his mother buys him one for his birthday - the one that contains the spirit of Charles Lee Ray (who we will come to know as Chucky)! As the body count rises, so does the terror as Chucky is determined to put his soul into Andy's body, killing everyone in his way.<br /><br />Child's Play is scary and quite gory and has some origional deaths. In my opinion, the start of one of the best slasher movie series.
B000A6T262|5.0|I love the whole star trek shows and now I can own all the movies that made star trek great.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie unexpectedly. In addition to its compelling story line I was struck by the collision of virtual and real reality that produces the tension that is only resolved at the very end.  And the resolution is choosing the real over the virtual and death over life, both for the writer and the character.  Of course this choice is different for the writer and the character: she chooses to save his life and he chooses to die so that he may save the life of another.  As our culture recklessly abandons our humanity for the seduction of a virutal world, it is a morality tale of choosing life over fame and money that could never be popular and will always be rewarding.
1400063515|3.0|Once upon a time, an exercise in logic was the following:<br /><br />All swans are white.<br />This bird is a swan.<br />ergo, this bird is white.<br /><br />Nobody ever had a problem with this, well, almost no one; some did. Then one day, a discovery was made in the western climes of Australia: there were birds there that looked like swans: large, aquatic, long slender neck, large distinctive beak; acted like swans: swam gracefully in the water, laid large eggs, waddled when walking on land. There was only one minor problem: they were black, not white. This created some problems; first, amongst the experts, who claimed a swan couldn't be black, but had to be white. Next, it completely destroyed the logic exercise mentioned above. It seems the problem was with the experts: they had decreed that swans were white, and now here was a bird in Australia that for all the world met the definition of a swan, except for color. It was a challenge to the experts.<br /><br />That, in a nutshell, is what Professor Taleb's book is all about: pointing out when, where and how some experts, in this case experts in the financial world, get caught by events that were not expected to occur. The sub title of the book, The Impact of the Highly Improbable, suggests that maybe probability might have something to do with why financial experts get caught with their predictions down: they don't understand probability. The real problem is that no one knows the future, so predictions about what may happen in the future are in fact nothing more than at best educated guesses, as weighted by the probability of the event occurring. There's the rub: no one knows the appropriate probability distribution to use when dealing with the future, and often it's the occurrence of \\"highly improbable\\" events that rip us up. Hurricane Katrina is an example: a once in a hundred or five hundred year event; and as such caught the responsible officials apparently flat footed. But there are other equally improbableevents that occur seemingly every day, like accidentally hitting a thumb with a hammer, and don't create the problems Katrina created. Why?<br /><br />One answer might be the value associated with the occurrence of the event. For example: a traveler from somewhere arrives in the US, and brings a mild stain of flu, which some of the population subsequently contract. Not much of a problem there. But suppose a traveler from somewhere arrives in the US with a nuclear device. That's a completely different kettle of fish. How, or who, can distinguish the difference in thes two events, untll after the fact?<br /><br />If' you've ever had a course in statistics or hope to at some time in the future, reading Professor Taleb's book will give you some grist to chew on, to mix a metaphor. Often overlooked is that statistics deals with the past, and probability deals with the future; they're only related by assumptions that we make about how the past s a predictor of the future. And since highly improbable events are, by definition, almost never represented in the statistics, except maybe as outliers, it follows that statistics really isn't a very good predictor of the future.<br /><br />The book is a good read; hopefully, after reading it, you'll be extremely skeptical of anybody who makes any prediction about the future; including this one.<br /><br />Oh, by the way: Professor Taleb apparently made a fortune in futures trading, following much of what he talks about in his book: skepticism.

0375842209|5.0|I have never felt compelled to write a review, but after completing 'The Book Thief' I feel that I want everyone to know how touching, beautiful, and emotionally compelling a book can be.    When I initially started reading this book I had no idea how I attached I would become to the main character, Liesel, and her many struggles and revalations growing up in Germany. The friends and companions she encounters are each strikingly different with entirely unique perspectives of life. One of my favorites is Hans Hubermann- gentle, kind, an avid musician, and dedicated to teaching Liesel the joy of reading. Another amazing character is of Rudy- best friend, accomplice in crime, and always searching to understand Liesel or to steal a kiss.    Rarely am I saddened when I finish a book. But I will honestly miss the story, most of all the characters who I feel have become close friends of mine (especially on late nights when I know I should put the book down and go to sleep.) Thank you Markus Zusak for writing one of the most beautiful books I have ever read!

I would usually listen to a cd only once all the way though, and then after that just skip around, but this is the only one that I can listen to over and over with out getting bored.<br /><br />The track Woman is especially ground breaking, taking old style rock-n-roll and mixing it with neo-punk and funk to create a truly special and unique sound. The track entitled the Joker and the Thief is also simply decadent to listen to. I feel like I am cheating on the rest of my collection by showing favoritism, but I really don't care when I am listening to WOLFMOTHER.<br /><br />It is akin to The Raconteurs, The White Stripes, or maybe Spiderbait--however it is truly its own creature and simply one of the best albums I have heard in years! No joke!
B000006IUQ|3.0|As he demonstrated with his one scene in \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\", Alec Baldwin is a natural fit for David Mamet's funny and biting dialogue. Baldwin was later given a bigger role in Mamet's \\"State and Main\\" where he starred as an actor who liked sleeping with  underage girls. Before he made that film he collaborated with Mamet on \\"The Edge\\". Baldwin plays Bob, a cocky fashion photographer with eyes for his favorite model Mickey (Elle MacPherson). The only catch is that Mickey is the boss's wife. The boss is a brilliant billionaire named Charles and he is played by Anthony Hopkins. Charles suspects the two are having an affair and confronts Bob about it. Before Bob can answer, the plane the men are riding in collides with a flock of birds and crashes into the sea. This frightening accident strands Bob, Charles, and Bob's assistant Steven (Harold Perrineau) in the cold Alaskan wilderness. The men scramble to find shelter and warmth and devise a plan to be rescued. They figure their best chance is working their way up the highest mountain where they will be most visible to passing helicopters. Standing in their way is a giant Kodiak bear who picks up on their scent and begins stalking them. When Steven gets torn apart by the bear Charles and Bob are left to find a way out. The two men are forced to put aside their suspicions about each other and work together at finding food and devising a way to reach the top of the mountain.  Charles is full of odd wisdom such as fashioning a compass out of a needle and a leaf. Mamet's script is fascinating at coming up with these odd remedies.  The acting is excellent. Hopkins makes Charles a sympathetic character who is by no means a victim. Charles has his smarts working in his favor. Bob is an arrogant jerk but as embodied by Baldwin an extremely likable jerk. He has so many great chunks of dialogue to recite in this film. Things aren't all talk as director Lee Tamahori stages several exciting action scenes between the two men andthe bear. Cinematographer Donald McAlpine captures beautiful shots of the dangerous waterfalls and mountains that our heroes cautiously navigate their way through.  Mamet fans as well as Baldwin fans should definitely check this smart and exciting film out.

0689505698|5.0|I picked this book out mainly because my 5 y.o. son adores the Three Little Pigs fairy tale, and I figured it would be in the same vein, but with a more sympathetic view of the wolves.    Oh, how marvelously wrong I was. I'll give you the plot summary.    Little wolves set out to build a house for themselves. They start with bricks. Enter Big Bad Pig, who can't blow the house down. So he quickly fetches a sledgehammer and knocks it straight down. House #2, concrete. BBP, pneumatic drill. House #3, barbed wire, iron bars, armor plates, heavy metal padlocks, Plexiglass and some reinforced steel chains. BBP, dynamite. Finally, the wolves say, \\"Something must be wrong with our building materials. We have to try something different. But what?\\"    And then, a flamingo comes along pushing a wheelbarrow full of . . . flowers.    I'm not going to spoil the ending, save to say it is a fantastic lesson about how useless an arms race is.    I'm pretty sure I appreciated this story a lot more than my son. But he also asks to read it over and over. This is a book that has many levels, and is great for staving off parent boredom while entertaining and educating your kids.    Montessori parents would definitely enjoy this book, as it helps teach the peace message that is part of the traditional Montessori curriculum.

B000JLSM00|5.0|One thing about blu-ray is that it will show how well OR how poorly a movie was originally made.  In this case, it shows why THE SEARCHERS has such a well-deserved reputation.  The filming of the scenery in Monument Valley is nothing short of wonderful.  Get it.

0671027573|1.0|This was my 4th novel read by linda howard and it seems like they are getting worse. She is a very good story teller, and her novels do a good job at keeping you interested BUT, the romantic parts of her novels are all the same! Her favorite line used by the main male character in EVERY novel, has him saying to the woman: \\"I plan on getting you naked\\", these words are said usually, during the second or third meeting between the 2 main characters, and the women in the novel are never offended by hearing these words from a man who in the most part, is still a stranger to them. Then, this is the best part, usually after the main man and the main woman have their first sexual encounter, they get engaged,(only after only knowing each other for a couple of weeks) PLEASE spare me. If everyone in this country got married after a good week or two of sexual encounters the divorce rate would be 90%. She has the men walking around at attention for the whole story, like the only thing on their minds is: you know what.  When you first read one of Howards novels, its kinda funny, but after 3, its just totally ridiculous! Finally, \\"perfect Stranger\\" has such a ridiculous unbelievable story line that i can see why linda howard has to be both a romance writer and mystery writer, because she has to have 2 chances for making a good story line, not only one. Save your time and money for something else rather then Linda Howard novels...

B0000047CW|5.0|Back in 1962, Stan Getz (tenor sax) and Charlie Byrd (acoustic guitar) collaborated to produce 'Jazz Samba' - an album which combines the sounds of West Coast cool jazz with the swaying rhythms of the Bossa Nova. I don't listen to much jazz, so I'm hardly qualified to review the album from this perspective; nonetheless, 'Jazz Samba' has a lot of appeal for me, as someone with more mainstream tastes in popular music.<br /><br />Whilst the playing of Stan Getz is far from aggressive, it is the dominant feature of the album. He has a fluent and unforced style of playing - one which gives the impression that he is breathing into the saxophone rather than blowing into it. By contrast, the delicate playing of Charlie Byrd is far more subdued. Even if there are times when his playing seems to be relegated to that of accompaniment only (at least, that's how it struck me), he also presents the listener with a number of exquisite short solos. The supporting musicians (on acoustic bass, 2nd. guitar and drums) provide the rhythmic impetus for the album, and their playing is also a delight.<br /><br />I like the whole album but, because I tend to prefer music with a somewhat slower tempo, 'Desafinado', 'Samba Triste', 'Samba de Uma Nota So' and 'Bahia' are the songs that I enjoy most. There is a bonus track (compared to the original vinyl release) but, as far as I can tell, this is nothing more than a 2 minute radio edit of 'Desafinado'. My version of the album was advertised as 're-issued and re-mastered', but the word 're-mastered' appears nowhere in the liner notes/production credits. My copy is a 'Verve Master Edition' with liner notes boasting 'High-resolution, 20-bit digital transfer' - this sounds pretty impressive, and I must say that, subjectively, I thought the sound quality was exceptionally good.<br /><br />'Jazz Samba' features a lot of fine playing from all of the musicians, and I think the sound quality is outstanding. The music creates a spacious atmosphere, and it also has a high 'chill factor'. I think 'Jazz Samba' is an essential purchase for anyone who likes the sensuous and infectious rhythms of modern Latin American music.it also has a high 'chill factor'.

It has all the more obscure music that I find entertaining in the movie, and having \\"What Conition my Condition is In\\" and the Latin heat of the Gypsy King's version of \\"Hotel California\\" aren't to be missed.  Go for it, you Achievers.
B001VFEKOK|3.0|I'm a bit disappointed as I came to get the songs I don't have and you can only get the them by buying the whole album! So what about all of us that already bought the album the first time around, are we just screwed? Not really fair especially in these economic times Amazon!    As for Rob's \\"Let Me Sign\\" iTunes had it available if you Pre-ordered the album along with instrumentals of the classical songs mentioned. Border's version had Paramores' \\"Decode\\" in acoustic.    Anyways, as much as I like the series I'm annoyed that the special features can't be downloaded separately from the rest of the album.   No kudos for you record company =(
B000XTCBWS|4.0|This is by far the most expensive Ring cycle on offer anywhere, so prospective buyrs need all the information they can get. Having heard all four installments (and given each an individual review), I'd like to demur form the five-star brigade, not entirely but selectively.<br /><br />Das Rheingold: The weakest of the set. A peculiarly noisy contrapion on stage during the second scene, in the realm of the NIebelungen, ruins this reading for me. There are a haandful of better stereo recordings; my preference is either Karajan or boulez, but bohm and Solti have their merits.<br /><br />Die Walkure: A middling good reading, given that we have outstanding ones from Karajan and Furtwangler (mono) and very good ones from Boulez, Leinsdorf, Bohm, and Levine. Here the principal drwback is Keilberth's lackluster conducting of the great scenes, and the generally mediocre orchestral execution.  Solti's Decca version is the weaakest part of his Ring cycle, but the Vienna Phil. is light years ahead of this ensemble.<br /><br />Siegfried: The trimph of the Keilberth cycle.  HIs conducting is at its best -- energetic and flexible at the same time. The young Windgassen gives his best performance of Siegfried, far and away preferable to his older self under Solti. There are, alas, no other great siegfrieds singing the role that I know of, not in the modern era, at least.<br /><br />Gotterdammerung: Another high point in the Keilberth cycle. I never thought that Solti's magnificent version would be surpassed, and in terms of recorded sound and orchestral execution, it hasn't been. But Varnay offers a towering Brunnhilde that can compete with Nilsson's (making some compensation for the stage and not being able to take a break between scenes, as Nilsson could do in the studio). Keilberth also does well, as does the young Windgassen as Siegfried. Strong all aorund.<br /><br />In sum, I would only rank two installments as first rate and therefore would buy those individually, even at Testament's high price per disc.
B001S86J2Q|4.0|It doesn't matter if you are a fan of musicals or not, you will have fun with this 1950s High School movie complete with Hot Rod race made in 1978. I don't think it could be cast any better. John Travolta as a loner that has the bad boy look but isn't so bad he mistreats others. Olivia Newton John as the preppy that develops an interest in that bad boy and metamorphs herself. Stockard Channing as a bad girl leading a pink lady gang that looks for trouble and stirs the pot. They all do great jobs along with the rest the cast. The cast, directing, choreography, sets, and music are remarkable compared to other musicals. I highly recommend this one.

B000005S0D|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this album.  With the exception of some nice guitar playing from Andy Latimer, the music on Stationary Traveler (1984) is nothing more than bland, 1980s corporate rock.<br /><br />At this point, Camel was a band in name only. Guitarist Andy Latimer was the only remaining member of the classic Camel lineup, which suffered numerous personnel changes starting in 1977. Andy plays many of the instruments on this album, and is joined by various studio musicians including members of the Alan Parsons Project, a short appearance by ex-King Crimson reedman Mel Collins (he also appeared on a few Camel albums), and keyboardist Tom Scherpenzeel. As such, this album (along with The Single Factor [1982]) can be considered an Andy Latimer solo effort.<br /><br />Of the players, it is only Andy that manages to have a unique voice and I especially missed the excellent drumming of Andy Ward. Speaking of drums, the snare drum tone is characteristic of most 1980s music - very loud and heavily echoed. The drum programming that turns up here and there does not help much either.<br /><br />The ten tracks on the album range in length from 2 - 6 minutes and consist of a mixture of instrumentals and tracks with vocals. While some of the instrumentals are pretty nice and feature excellent electric/acoustic guitar playing and brooding synthesizers (mostly Yamaha CS-80, Juno 6, and Fairlight), the vocal tracks, while melodic, are fairly weak. Of the ten tracks, my favorite piece includes the instrumental Stationary Traveler.<br /><br />This album has not been remastered and the liner notes feature the lyrics and personnel listing. The sound quality is good, although there were some production choices that I could have done without - the \\"big\\" 1980s snare drum sound for example. Total running time equals 42:18.<br /><br />All in all, of the albums released by Camel in the 1980s, Nude (1981) is the best; come to think of it, the live album On the Road 1981 presents an excellent live version of Nude. Stationary Traveler on the other hand is a collection of dull pop tunes that shows Andy Latimer trying to mesh with trends in popular music circa 1984. While his attempts to incorporate New Wave are commendable, the overall result that comes out of the headphones is dull, corporate rock with a toe or two in the British symphonic pop style.<br /><br />Following the release of Stationary Traveler, Camel would not release another studio album until 1991 (the excellent Dust and Dreams).an excellent live version of Nude.

0143038095|4.0|The Joy Luck Club is a story of mothers and daughters, of two generations coming together and trying to understand one another. Through the mothers' stories and the daughters' similar experiences that help them to learn from their mothers, they learn to love one another for who the other truly is and was. Though the daughters in The Joy Luck Club have hard times understanding their mothers, and appreciation for the mother's traditional Chinese ways comes difficultly, the girls learn through the stories that their mothers were once young like them, having dreams and aspirations for their future. It's a beautiful book of broken relationships healed, of old bitterness surfaced and dealt with, and ultimately of finding yourself in the people you love most.    the Chinese aspect of the book is intriguing. There are so many customs and traditions that I have taken for granted, having many Chinese friends and yet never fully understanding who they are and what their culture is. This book opens up a whole new philosophy to life that is foreign and seemingly irregular to the average American-Western reader. But after reading this book I have found the honest, devoted, and terrifyingly loving reasons behind Chinese ways, which is challenging to my own comfortable beliefs and the social structure that I have grown up in.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|Daniel Craig continues here as the new Bond and also a new type of Bond. As in Casino Royale, his Bond is more violent and much less concerned with fine wines and fashion. There's no Q (or R) or Moneypenny and a fair amount less comedy than many previous Bond pictures. I've heard the word \\"reboot\\" to describe Craig's 2 Bond films as opposed to being the 20 something sequel to \\"Dr. No\\".   \\"Quantum\\" is a bit shorter than many Bond films and it picks up where \\"Casino Royale\\" left off. Bond seems to be less of a ladies man than before here and there is plenty of action. I'd rate this a little below \\"Casino Royale\\" but still a worthwhile movie. It will be interesting to see where they take this veteran character in the future.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Just when you thought that there was nothing to add to the tired old vampire genre comes this absolute masterpiece from Sweden.  \\"Let the Right One In\\" is one of those rare and wonderful cinematic treats - a literate and thought provoking horror film.  John Ajvide Lindqvist based the screenplay on his own acclaimed novel.  The film has been impeccably realized by director/editor Tomas Alfredson, cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and composer Johan Soderqvist (indeed all the elements coalesce and congeal perfectly).  Kare Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson and Eli (short for Elias - and yes, he was a boy in the book - was, but something completely different now) should have shared an Oscar for Best Juvenile Performance (if the Academy would only reinstate them).  Stark, simple, mesmerizing, creepy and truly frightening; place this DVD on your shelf next to Del Toro's \\"The Devil's Backbone\\" and Boyle's \\"28 Days Later\\", genre expanding variations on classic horror themes.
0143038095|4.0|The dynamism of mother-daughter relationships is certainly nothing new. There are hundreds, if not thousands of stories out there that describe this unique interaction from every conceivable angle, but Amy Tan gives it a fresh treatment with \\"The Joy Luck Club.\\"     This is a clever and thoroughly genuine chronicle of the lives of four Chinese women and their daughters - told from both perspectives in small, vividly detailed vignettes that are almost complete stories within themselves. Tan gives each of these women character and life, and isn't afraid to expose the troubled elements that exist between them. The characters at times appear a bit one-dimensional in that much of what is described is the self-angst that each of them harbors due to the difficult times they have experienced, both in China and America, and contrary to the title of the book (or perhaps perfectly on purpose) there seems to be neither joy OR luck in these women's lives.     Many of the troublesome elements of their relationships are cultural in nature - with the reserved, proud and subservient attitudes of the mothers clashing with the individualistic and more self-centered traits of their daughters, who have been raised in America. The younger generation is understandably torn between obligation to the Chinese culture of their family while at the same time wanting to adapt to the American way of life, which in many ways is the polar opposite than that of the Chinese. While many aspects of Chinese culture - especially the way women are treated - are foreign and sometimes even repugnant to non-Chinese, Tan demonstrates in often subtle ways through her character interactions how sometimes the Chinese way of viewing life and conducting oneself is actually more beneficial in the long run.    My only other criticisms of this novel are that because of the way it is written, it is a bit hard to follow at times, and it would have also been nice to see Tan give a more thorough treatment to the roles that the men played in these women's lives. Generally speaking, the men are not seen in very much positive light, and it does end up seeming a bit unrealistic that the negative aspects portrayed were the only dimensions that existed in the brothers, fathers and sons depicted in the novel.     Overall, however, this is a very satisfying read and well worth the time.

B001DDCVCI|3.0|The main reason I bought this set is to watch the performances of Johnny Cash in Folsom Prison on DVD. I remember watching \\"Johnny Cash in Folsom Prison\\" on TV when I was in Australia, in 1969 and enjoyed the TV special very much. It was a long special with him performing and showing the prisoners and the clanking of the jail house gates. I bought the Legacy package hoping that the DVD will contain that concert video or at least part of it but was very disappointed that it hardly has any visual of Johnny Cash performing in Folsom at all. However, I do enjoy the extra tracks in the CDs although I already have most of the songs. I guess this is a collector's item.

B000ETQPYM|4.0|It is always a nice change to read something written from a non-American viewpoint. There's a different flavor to the characters.  Some of the scenes had me laughing out loud. Eventhough the entire book is written about grief and I did cry a little most of the book was about taking each day as a gift and opening all opportunities as though they were presents.  The main character had to be reminded of that from her deceased spouse but it teaches us all that we can make good out of bad and to take chances.  Hard to believe this was written by such a young (early 20s) author.
1594201927|2.0|I picked up The Ascent of Money on a whim, not knowing who Niall Ferguson is or what other books he's written I figured a history lesson on financial systems could make for an interesting read.  Overall, it was interesting.      Ferguson gives a terrific overview of the history of finance, roughly from the 17th century through to today, and presents the various achievements of different regions in a mostly chronological order, only breaking chronology a few times to connect events which he does superbly.  The beginning of the book presented much new information to me that I found to be very intriguing; I have always viewed the history of finances and money as something that would be confusing to me and difficult to sort out, but here in The Ascent of Money Ferguson has done the research and made a cohesive textbook worthy lesson of financial history.       What bothers me about this book is the commentary, sometimes cloaked in ambiguity, which is sprinkled throughout the book and especially in the later chapters.  Ferguson does a good job showing the disasters that loose credit and fiat money can cause in an economic system but fails to apply his own lesson while analyzing the great depression, S&L crisis, or our current economic crises.  He seems to gloss over fractional reserve banking as merely part of the evolution and \\"the ascent of money\\" thus neglecting its fraudulent nature.      The strangest thing to me is that throughout the book's lessons there seemed to be some very easy diagnoses to the various disasters discussed that Ferguson almost missed completely- that is the cause was various governments meddling in the supply and control of money.  Some of the time Ferguson did make this observation, although scantily analyzing it, but seems to think that when war broke and one financial system usurped another that was the end of the story- even though another economic disaster came after that for similar reasons.  There is hardly any discussion on gold, andnone on how a commodity based monetary system could have loosed the stranglehold oppressive regimes had on their subjects or prevented or minimized the economic damage.      It's very possible that I let my own bias interfere with my enjoyment of this book.  As I said, the history lesson was great and much needed for me; but the commentary made the book quite frustrating toward the end.  My own bias may have further been exacerbated by Ferguson's own bias- that is, of all the economists and schools of thought sited throughout The Ascent of Money there is a very noticeable lack of a certain set of economists.  Nowhere in the book are the names Murray Rothbard, Ludwig von Mises, Henry Hazlitt, and F.A. Hayek introduced, nor is the Austrian school of economics even uttered.  By citing Keynes/Krugman numerously or Friedman some, Ferguson gives a very one sided analysis outside of his own- and his entire exclusion of the Austrian school economists, of whom Hayek won the Nobel Prize for his contribution of business cycle theory, leaves one to question how much more interesting or important this book could have been.      If you're looking for a book to help you understand the current crises we face, and who to blame, do not look here- this is just a good history lesson and not a whole lot more- you should read [[ASIN:1596985879 Meltdown: A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse]] by Tom Woods.  I recommend reading [[ASIN:B001E3QMQI Power and Market: Government and the Economy]] by Murray Rothbard before or shortly after reading The Ascent of Money to help even out the commentary Ferguson provides in The Ascent of Money.

Moreover, Amy Tan's novel helped me understand Chinese immigrants' experiences in the United States and the struggle that many immigrants face in reconciling their lofty dreams of success in America with the hard truth that not all who come to America have the easy life for which they had hoped.

0618918248|5.0|For years I have given only passing thought to the subject of religion.  I was always much too busy to participate or even seriously consider whether I was a Christian/Atheist/Agnostic/etc.  But recently I've decided to face this very controversial issue and try to find my own beliefs.<br /><br />What I am starting to find is that there is no way that religion and science can coexist.  The only plausible defense of the bible is that people interpret it allegorically but no matter how you interpret it, the bible is full of absolute beliefs that people should be very nervous about.  Dawkins exploits just about every argument or basis for religion.  If you ever asked yourself these questions, this book is for you:<br /><br />Even if I don't believe in religion, is the practice something that doesn't hurt and should be ignored?<br /><br />Shouldn't I just hedge my bets and believe in god? After all, the price for being wrong is very high.<br /><br />Can I still be a moral person without the bible?<br /><br />Isn't the bible a great foundation for morals that even non-believers could learn from?<br /><br />If there is no god then why do people do the right thing?<br /><br />What about the gaps in science? Doesn't that prove that creationism is correct?<br /><br />And many, many more.  I encourage you to open your mind and consider the message the author is trying to convey.

075640407X|4.0|One of the ways I know a good book is by how eager I am to share it. The more often I am driven toward having that shared experience, toward repeating the writer's words, the more incredible the story. The Name of the Wind is an instant classic. Timelessly beautiful and quotable.     I've relived chapters in my mind moved again and again by the grand beginnings of this most epic tale. I set the book down eager for more and wholly committed to owning the audio book when available. Patrick Rothfuss sets down words like meaningful lyrics and I know hearing them will be just as lovely as reading them. The world and character's he creates stay believable even with its fantastic themes. A definite recommend.

B0015RRN8O|5.0|I had never seen the version from the 60's, and I'm still not that enthused about it. I find the 1999 version to be romantic and exciting and contemporary. This movie never gets old and the film had introduced me to Nina Simone, which is another thing I watch and listen to constantly..
B001KEGRCA|5.0|We bought the movie because our daughter and childhood friends were river guides for OARS.  It's also a great way to run the Colorado River when your waiting for your next trip.  Disappointed in the color quality of the video.  It's faded and doesn't match up to the quality of the video at the IMAX theatre.  It would also be nice if they would have included the 3d glasses.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This CD was just fantastic and I listen to it at least twice a day.
0385340540|1.0|I have only finished reading half of the book and I couldn't continue anymore.  It was a big yawn.    The first half of the book is about a middle-aged white guy who gets released early from prison with a string attached.  The Feds smuggle him out of the U.S. into Italy.  And I said to myself: Okay, let's fun begins.  Well, wrong.  Up to half of the book, that poor guy struggles to learn a new language while sightsees a new country.  I don't need to see that.    So I closed the book and returned it to the library.    If they turn this book into a movie, they'd probably pack the first half of the book into a 5-minute screen time.
0312539517|4.0|Jeffrey Archer (Kane and Abel, First Among Equals) has been turning out notable books for decades. Paths of Glory is the story of George Mallory, a British mountaineer who died on Everest in 1924. His body was found in 1999 not far from the summit and it is possible (as the book asserts) that he reached the top and died on the way down. If so, he would have beaten Sir Edmund Hillary by almost 30 years. Mallory's name is not well known today, but perhaps it should be because the reply to the question of why someone would climb a mountain, \\"Because it is there\\", is attributed to him.    This is a book in the old school. A stiff upper lip and disdain for danger is everything to the characters. It reads something like the classic Beau Geste (P.C. Wren). The book describes Mallory's childhood, his prodigious climbing ability and his youthful shenanigans. Interestingly, he was a friend of Robert Graves, the poet and author of such books as I, Claudius. Primarily this is a laudatory ode to a great British hero. The political considerations of the Everest Committee that organized the expedition are perhaps the only occasion for Archer to be critical of anything. Here Arthur Hinks, its secretary, is cast as the villain and his insistence on denying Mallory's associate and competitor, George Finch, a spot on the second expedition is presented as one cause of Mallory's death. Although Mallory is depicted as a fearless climber, like some hero out of the Iliad, the fact that he left behind a wife and three children, does give one pause for thought. Their anguish at losing a husband and father, even though he died doing what he must have loved above all else, can only be imagined.     This book is a fictionalized account and not a biography by any stretch of imagination. As mentioned previously it is written in a somewhat dated style. Even so, it is very engaging. Even though the end was known, I found it hard to put down until the last page.
B000003FMY|5.0|Five stars are really insufficient to rate this pinnacle of orchestral playing and recording.  Reiner leads (or drives) his Chicagoans to an unmatched level of performance here.  The level of precision is absolutely unreal, yet it never stifles or impedes the flow of the music (as George Szell could do with the Cleveland Orchestra). The orchestra plays with an agility that makes many other good renditions of \\"Pictures\\" sound almost clumsy. The energy of this performance will stun you if you haven't heard it before.    As far as \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" is concerned, I differ with the reviewer who objects to its' frantic pace. I own and enjoy about 20 recordings of the piece, but Reiner's rendition has an unmatched ferocity, which seems appropriate to me for a demonic (or at least pagan) ritual.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I love this show! It's so nice to have it all in one package instead of having to by each season individually.  A little pricey, but when compared to buying all of the seasons separately it's a steal.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|Michael Caine is smashing!  Always understated, yet he has the ability to stand out from everyone else on screen.  This original screenplay was made on a shoestring, but did not miss a beat. When a movie is this good, there is no reason to re-make it.  At first, I was disappointed with the ending, but if you watch the commentary version, you will understand that it was deliberately designed for a sequel, which never happened.  Too bad.  The movie has you wanting more of their antics.
B0000041BX|3.0|Apart from the sound problems (intermittent thumping) inherent in the master tape of No. 14 &#34;Death and the Maiden&#34;, for me there is a problem with the overall approach of this distinguished quartet. Their tempi are slow, yet they use little rubato; their playing is impeccably tuned but, to quote Browning, &#34;a common greyness silvers everything&#34; and sent me scuttling back to performances by quartets such as the Juilliard, who really feel the music and bring it alive in a manner quite foreign to the Italians. The last thing Schubert, that most emotional and mercurial of composers, needs, is a measured approach to his glorious music; it is not meant to be played like Mozart but in a truly Romantic style: febrile, obsessive passages alternating with achingly poignant melodies.<br /><br />Given that some other reviewers clearly hear only perfection in these performances and that their reviews have attracted many supportive votes, I suggest that you listen before you buy and decide how you like your Schubert, especially, as, if you look carefully, you will find that several other reviewers, like me, sound a note of caution. I don't like their measured, understated manner at all, and will always need more verve, urgency and commitment than these cool accounts provide. (Incidentally, I have exactly the same problem with their Beethoven.)
031606792X|5.0|Another great book from Stephenie Meyer, for a first author, her four books in the Twilight Series are wonderful and exciting to read. The only problem is putting them down to either sleep or get some work done!! I would recommend both for the persons that like love stories and also vampire enthusiasts. I am not a big vampire reader, but once I started this series, I couldn't wait to complete the series. Now I'm off to read it the second time!!!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|\\"Australia\\" is an epic film, reminiscent of \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" and \\"Hawaii,\\" with perhaps, a touch of the fabulous non-epic \\"African Queen.\\" The combination of director and screenwriter Baz Luhrmann and Nicole Kidman is a winning one. Although \\"Australia\\" is far different from their collaborative effort in \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" (2001), I enjoyed this unconventional Aussie flick every bit as much. And what could be bad: with rousing action, sweeping landscapes, (kudos to cinematographer Mandy Walker), fabulous costumes, a hero's hero, a heroine worthy of the title, tear-jerking, dramatic kitsch, love, hate, loss, racism, war, a really nasty villain, Australian and Aboriginal history and culture, and so much more?  I say \\"BOO\\" to the professional critics who panned the film, Most people I know really liked it - men as well as women - so I won't bother to call this a chick flick. I never listen to these critics anyway. This is fun movie!<br /><br />Nullah, a young boy of mixed race - part aborigine, part Caucasian - is our narrator. He is nothing but wonderful in this role. Nullah is the grandson of King George, (David Gulpilil), an aboriginal shaman who teaches him the magical culture of their people. Nullah and his indigenous family are always on guard against the white \\"cops,\\" who want to take the countries \\"creamies,\\" (half breeds, usually illigimate), away from their native people and transport them to Mission Island to be educated in Western culture and religion.<br /><br />Just before the beginning of WWII, Lady Sarah Ashley, (Kidman), leaves the luxury of her English home to search for her estranged husband, who runs a remote cattle ranch, \\"Far Away Downs,\\" located in Australia's Northern Territory. Lady Sarah is determined to sell the ranch/station and drag hubby back to civilization. She arrives and storms into a local saloon looking for a man called \\"Drover,\\" (Hugh Jackman), who is supposed to meet her and drive her to \\"Far Away Downs.\\" And Drover is so not what she expected.<br /><br />After a 3 day drive through the outback, which really ruffles the aristocratic lady's sensibilities, not to mention her elegant clothes and make-up, she reaches her destination only to find her husband dead, murdered. King George is accused of the crime. Lord Ashley had been attempting to break the monopoly on providing the military with beef held by King Carney, (Bryan Brown), a local bigwig. Carney, who seems to run everything in the area, is looking to have Lady Sarah sell him the ranch at a fraction of its worth, and doesn't care what he or his lackeys have to do to force the sale. After checking-out how things are being run at the ranch, and meeting young Nullah, Lady Sarah, uncharacteristically, decides to stay and make some serious changes.<br /><br />This film is obviously a labor of love by the director, cast and crew, who are mostly Australian and proud of it! I am always a fan of art, film and otherwise, created with lots of heart. Probably the best moments, for me, are those which deal with the aboriginal culture and the story of \\"the stolen generations,\\" children of mixed race, who during the 19th century and part of the 20th, were forcibly separated from their cultures by white Australians to \\"civilize\\" them.<br /><br />Again, I really like \\"Australia.\\" I was very entertained and recommend it.<br />Jana Perskie.

0790731452|5.0|I'm not a big comedy fan, but I needed a laugh this week so I watched Mars Attacks--something I've been meaning to do for years. I've always remembered that the trailer made the movie appear to be utterly demented--and in this I was not disappointed. The combination of big-name dramatic stars, cheesy special effects, brilliantly bug-eyed Martians, '50's-style spooky sci-fi score, and completely over-the-top slapstick and sight gags made for an unforgettable film. The initial firefight in the Nevada desert, and the White House infiltration scene sporting a Martian dressed as a '50s glamor girl, complete with bouffant, are particular high points.    A very refreshing aspect of this movie, unlike most comedy efforts of this genre in the last couple of decades, is that it's almost completely devoid of bathroom or sexual humor. Of course there's violence--lots and lots of violence--but it's so ridiculously overdone that I have trouble imagining that anyone could take offense at it.    If you like your humor highly physical and not at all witty or subtle, but don't particularly prefer wallowing in the toilet or gutter, this is your film.
B000002TQV|5.0|Music is many things to many people, but I think we can all agree that at its finest, a song can lift us out of the mundane for a brief, transcendent moment in time.  The sounds that unlock these moments are unique from person to person and day-to-day even within the span of our own lives.  For example, I might have listened to a song dozens of times in the past, but if I hear it at just the right moment in my life, circumstance and memory collide to \\"unlock\\" the tune for myself.  I hear the song in a different way, as cheesy or strange as that sounds.    Lately I've been hearing the album \\"The Bends\\" in that way.  This collection of twelve soaring pop-rock songs evoke frustration, boredom, alienation, anxiety, and anger vicariously with glimmers of joy and hope; in short, it's slowly coming to sum up my mid-twenties.      Anyway, enough about my emotional attachment to this music, let's get to the bottom line of this review: \\"The Bends\\" offers up an obscene amount of \\"more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts\\" musical moments and comes highly recommended (surprise, surprise) from this reviewer.  It is equally enjoyable through headphones, cranked over the car stereo, or murmuring in the background at a party.  Enjoy!

B001PPGAIA|1.0|This is the first review I've ever submitted on Amazon. I had to write one after viewing this movie, only to warn others to stay away from it.  It is just a ridiculous movie. It's like a live action cartoon. It should be sold as such. It's not serious enough to be considered a drama, it's not (intentionally) funny enough to be considered a comedy. It's bad acting (Nicole Kidman, what have you done?), and the characters move about like Keystone Cops. Stay away from this one. If you've already made the mistake of buying it, you might want to throw this one on the barbie.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Buy this CD. If you ignored the short review then beware, there's a sudden storm coming, when you see the thunderheads boiling walk, out into the field as far away from all else as you can, raise your arms above your head and wait...you'll hear the crack, but you'll never see the flash...Renee Olstead's Skylark will blind you, take your breath away and leave you dazed and gasping, you've just been struck by red lightning. There are singers who can sing sweet and there are singers who can sing loud, but only once in lifetime does one come along who can rattle the gates of heaven and then whisper so sweet and low that the summer wind has to stop to hear. Skylark weaves the magic of Johnny Mercer with the voice of Renee Olstead and between them they blow up a gale to make the angels weep. Then Renee turns it around and does to Boogie Ride what Toni Tennille did with You Never Done It Like That and somewhere off in heaven Mae West is smiling. Anyone can twist a lyric and make innocent words tell a naughty tale, but to add a dash of laughter and a bit of wink and what you have is a saucy song that makes everything seem a little better...that's talent. There's plenty of good stuff to go around, Midnight Man will make you stay up late, My Baby Don't Care will make you wish and Ain't We Got Fun sums up this disc as well as bringing an old tune back to life, there's Hit The Road Jack and Midnight In Austin Texas and everything in between. This CD is so good I have four copies, one for each car and one for the house. I was right in the first place, buy this CD.

B001U0HBPQ|2.0|Oscar nomination or not, this is the most boring movie I've seen since MEET JOE BLACK. It's sad to see so much talent and effort gone to waste but what exactly is appealing about this story ? Why on earth would a little girl and a seemingly old man find themselves bonded to each other in the first place ? Why don't Guiness/Ripley or the media stop by when what you've got here is the ultimate freak story ?. The only fun I had throughout this movie was making a list of the similarities with Forrest Gump which run in the several dozens. The Katrina back-story could have been of interest but at the end, all they used it for is as an excuse to flood a room ! This movie has easily the best aging effects in history but you end up noticing you spend most of the time evaluating them instead of getting involved with the story which is the basic symptom that this movie fails.

B000O75VSK|5.0|I originally purchased the music only CD as I was not aware that the enhanced version was available. Soooooo glad I got this version. After Forever were amazing yet their rubbish record company (Transmission) did'nt promote them well at all. After Nuclear Blast took them on it was hoped for better things but the band decided to fold. Now their catalogue is almost unavailable anywhere. They didn't really get a DVD concert together which is more the pity! What an amazing and quite original band that too many people will not get to see or hear.
0312383320|4.0|I completely disagree with the negative reviews. I thought Carl was hysterical; he gives people the finger and plays Super Mario, for God's sake.  Of course it's outlandish and over the top; it's entertainment, not Dostoyevsky or Kafka. The Easter Bunny and the Fire Farter cracked me up as well.  It appears that the author's intent is to offer some light Stephanie to fill in between the (slightly) more serious By The Numbers series; if so, she succeeds famously. Having said all that, it surprised me that no one seemed to get the symbolism of the monkeys; an aspect of the novel to which you nay sayers might wish to devote some thought.
1416562605|5.0|Fascinating and fierce, Aravind Adiga's debut novel resonates in many ways. Even though I do not live in India, I feel I am in that country. The situations, the philosophizing, the twists feels so real. Maybe because I also live in a country surrounded by poverty, I can relate to most parts anyway. I feel White Tiger should follow the steps of Q&A.
B000W91RUG|4.0|I saw clips of it on the internet and I wanted to see the whole season, and I thought it was hilarious. It is about these geeks that just realized that a super hot niehbor just moved in next door and it soon throws their whole life style off as the new neihbor wants to be a part of the group.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|The latest studio album from Nickelback has a great dark gritty edge. It is harder then some of their more recent offerings. It also has some really raunchy undertones, in both the music and the lyrics. There are some gritty songs such as Something In Your Mouth, Shakin' Hands and S.E.X. that include such lyrics as \\"Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body\\" and \\"They say it's over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on!\\" from Something In Your Mouth. Also from Shaking Hands:<br />\\"Well, she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed<br />'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west<br />Far too pretty to be giving it cheap<br />That's why she's making six figures workin' three days a week\\".<br />This is an amazing album, good to work to great to drive to. The album is so good it is all I have listened to for over a week straight. There is fantastic percussion, strong guitar riffs and, as always, tremendous vocals from Chad Kroeger. The album is riveting. You find yourself enjoying the tune you're listening to and anticipating the one to come. The only drawback is, because of how raunchy the album is, I cannot listen to it with the kids in the car, and an example is from S.E.X.:<br />\\"Yes sex is always the answer<br />It's never a question<br />Cause the answer's yes<br />Oh the answer's yes<br />Not just a suggestion<br />If you ask the question<br />Then it's always yes\\".<br />But for personal enjoyment it is my favorite rock or metal album to be released in the last few years. Pick it up for simple pleasure to the ears and lyrics that raise a lot of interesting questions about our society.<br /><br />(First Published in Imprint 2009-03-20.)
B000MV90IU|5.0|This movie looks great on Blu-ray considering it is 40 years old. Some darker sceens are not as clear as the rest of the movie but considering the age they still look good.  The famous car chase through the streets is a must see in HD!

I am glad I did.<br /><br />Carl \\"Mikael\\" Blomkvist, investigative reporter, has just been convicted of libel against the head of a Swedish company. We know he is innocent after being fed misinformation from a source he thought he could trust. There are several plots woven through this novel, but the main one is a murder mystery. Decades ago Harriet Vanger, whose family owned an old company with old money in Sweden, disappeared from her family's island on a summer day. Due to an accident on the bridge leading to the island, only the people on the island that day could've contributed to her disappearance.<br /><br />The question that drives the novel is what happened to Harriet? Mikael is hired by her uncle (who is in failing health) to look into the circumstances surrounding Harriet's disappearance. The author did a great job of slowly painting a picture of the Vanger family's troubles and idiosyncrasies; as a reader I was wary of trusting any of them, since many had motivations for wanting Harriet gone.<br /><br />I can't describe the ending without giving away spoilers, but I will say it does fit the tone of the book. Overall I enjoyed this read, and would recommend it to other who aren't squeamish (there is graphic descriptions of sexual and other violence).
1932907009|5.0|Save the Cat by Blake Snyder is written for screenwriters, but movie lovers will get a lot out of it, too.  Snyder humorously and cleverly writes about the rules that should be followed by the successful screenwriter, and he gives many examples of what to look for in films that follow the formula.  By the end of the book readers are excited to realize that they will never see a film the same way again.  Their eyes are open now -- they've gone from \\"regular\\" to HD!  After finishing the book the movie lover will relish viewing films and TV shows and spotting the \\"Pope in the pool\\" moment, or an example of \\"Monster in the House.\\"  This book makes you feel like you're in-the-know and promotes enhanced viewing of films.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|The only reason I bought TEMPLE OF THE DOG, SOUNDGARDEN, AUDIOSLAVE, cds is because of CHRIS CORNELL. The man has a voice. Don't get me wrong. I mean only a few artist can take mediocre music and make it sound greater than it really is. CHRIS CORNELL is one of those artist. I mean I wasn't a fan of RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE until I saw that the guy from TEMPLE OF THE DOG had joined them. I mean the guy's voice is that good. This cd had it's repetitve points but the overall layout was great. NEVER FAR AWAY, PART OF ME, LONG GONE, SCREAM, and OTHER SIDE OF TOWN really stuck out. Synthesizers or not CHRIS's voice did not suffer in any way. Download the cd or buy it or both.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie is utterly captivating!  I really didn't expect to enjoy this DVD as much as I do.  I am glad I read the reviews and saw the great ratings that this DVD received.  I believe that even those who might not enjoy Jane Austen would enjoy the romance and storyline of this movie (who knows, maybe they'd get motivated to actually read the book).  The close captioning/subtitles would be helpful to some who have difficulties with the spoken words.
1400079179|2.0|Ok, two stars for ideas and use of actual historical artifacts.  However, in terms of being a good book, nothing.  I hated having to wade through the 400-or-so pages of \\"writing\\" to get the scrapping of a good idea.  I know 4th grader who write better.  This book was/is popular only because of stupid religious fanatics and lazy readers who think that, if they get through 10 chapter in one sitting, it's a good read.  It's crap.  One of the few cases in which I would recommend the movie over the book, and that's not saying much.  Read \\"Marathon Man,\\" more thrilling and much more satisfying.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|Baz is a great filmmaker; however, similar to \\"The Watchmen,\\" the media falsly associates \\"ambition\\" with \\"greatness,\\" and the results are unattainable expectations.  This is Baz's homage to classic Hollywood epics, and he pulls it off wonderfully.  Grandious acting, sprawling storylines and scenery, he makes it \\"like they used to.\\"<br /><br />Of course, this type of film hasn't been done in a while, so it's no surprise that the acting is awkward at times.  Modern actors acting old-fashioned is probably not a very easy task.  Also, any movie from Baz requires a commitment.  You're entering his world, so he shakes you up at the start, tries to free your mind up a bit, tries to make you laugh, introduces you to his world.  Once you're settled, he continues on his way, and it's a great ride...<br /><br />Unless you block him out.  If you shut the movie off after a half hour, or whine about it being goofy, etc, you're not going to enjoy it.  This entertainment.  Give it an honest chance, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
0374139563|5.0|While this book is about Africa, many of the overall insights, lessons, etc. Dambisa Moyo puts on paper here apply as much to the all but frozen state of postwar development and aid policies in many other parts of the world today.  This is easily one of the most important, well-written and documented books on the chronic band-aid solutions to the Third World challenges promulgated not just by celebrities and philanthrocapitalists but First World governments, foundations and other institutions still stuck in the early part of the 20th century.  Moyo's remarkable treatise should be required reading for public as well as private sector leaders.
B001HQZJP2|4.0|There's nothing quite like CGI effects in blu-ray.

1870946502|4.0|I worked at an English academy in South Korea and these books (and lots of repetition) were the primary way that we taught our young students phonics. The idea of using actions as a kinesthetic cue to remember both the name and the sound of a letter was highly effective. In our academy, we would have the students practice by saying, \\"My name is 'B', my sound is 'buh, buh, buh' while making the action indicated in these books.     If you were to do this, you would want to buy a set of flashcards with the letters for practice because the actual mileage that you get out of the Jolly Phonics books is not much.    This worked well for my class in South Korea but I am thinking of switching to using sign language to add a kinesthetic cue to learning letters. Why? Jolly Phonics is basically its own sign language, so why not use the real thing and give your kids some resources that they might be able to use later in life? (I realized this after I memorized actions for 26 letters and yet could only communicate with other people who use Jolly Phonics.)    Also, one final note, as an American, I did modify some of the later sounds. For example, the Jolly Phonics books have you say, \\"A, R, together - 'Ahhh' (with your mouth open like you're going to the dentist).\\" That is not how we pronounce it in America so instead we had the kids say \\"Arrrr\\" and make a hook with one finger like they were a pirate.    An interesting idea, and very effective with lots of repetition, but ultimately I think I'd go with sign language.
B001BWDG0W|3.0|Despite being a long-time Abba fan, I loved the less than professional singing of some of the actors in the movie...yes, even Pierce Brosnan.  The 'feeling' they put into the lyrics made them more meaningful.      My only disappointment was finding the singing on the CD was not quite like the movie, almost as if they electronically improved their voices...particularly in the case of Streep...and a lot of the quirkiness they added in inflection and tone in the movie was missing on the CD.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I must admit that I've had a bit of a DT stint lately. Honestly, it's been pretty bad. I've gone through all of the DT albums I own -- Train of Thought, Octavarium, Systematic Chaos, Live at Budokan, Images and Words, and Scenes from a Memory -- at least three times each in the past month.    I read the reviews on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and I was hooked right away. I had only heard some parts of SDOIT on the Live at Budokan set, and so I figured that there was a lot more to offer on the rest of this album.    Turns out, this is one of my favorite DT albums. In fact, I'd be hard-pressed to find one that I like better. It's heavy, but not like Train of Thought; it's thematic, but not quite like Scenes from a Memory; it's got long instrumentals and weird voiceovers, but not like Systematic Chaos. It's in between all of them.    I'll break it down by track...    The Glass Prison: Long and winding. I keep thinking that this song will end but it never does. Not one of my favorites on my album but a great start.    Blind Faith: Possibly my favorite DT track of all time. By the time the lyrics kick back in at the end of the solo section, the band is moving a million miles an hour and you can barely keep up. It sends shivers down my spine. I remember making a few friends listen to this song, and they treated it just like some random prog-rock song... until John Petrucci starts off the solo section with an absolute killer of a riff. Rudess just takes off during his parts. The fills that Portnoy throws in are spectacular. Lebrie hits just the right notes. Jesus, I love this song.    Misunderstood: I'm not much of a head-banger, but this song makes me want to be. Great track.    The Great Debate: A song about stem cell research, and a pretty blatant one at that. A great filler track that shows how daring these guys want to be. (How many bands write a song about this topic?)    Disappear: A lot of moods, paces, and tones in this one. Interesting track.    Six Degrees ofInner Turbulence: A conclusively massive 8-part second disc. I'll give my favorites here. About to Crash and About to Crash (Reprise) have a nice feel to them; they provide a very nice balance for the parts in between. The \\"cheesy\\" facets of DT come out in full in \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" and \\"Solitary Shell,\\" but I love these tracks nonetheless. It's songs like these that make me wonder where they get the imagination to write the way they do. Losing Time/Grand Finale makes for a nice, epic finish -- as it should -- for the album.     Buy this album. Now.
B00178I1PU|5.0|Not fancy but a good honest product that looks exactly like the picture. The arrows have no feathers, but they don't really need them. This works like a real bow by using the resiliency of the bow to fire the arrow. The string is not elastic. The arrows fly approximately 25 to 30 feet.
0439023483|5.0|I've yet to read this book, but once I head Stephenie Meyer say, that it was a very inspirational book, and that she liked it very much. I hope to read it, and will as soon as I can make myself remember to buy the book, and read it. I have many other books in wait, but this one seems like a good one to interrupt the others with. Hope it's good. It seems like it should be.    -Megan (14)
B000N3ST7A|5.0|This is an amazing CD - because it also comes with a GREAT DVD. Stevie gives a good hour of commentary about what went on behind the scenes while making the videos. Really interesting. Her depth and music bring a whole lot of joy to my life. \\"Edge of Seventeen\\", Rhiannon, & Landslide are fantastic here. Definitely a great buy that I'll buy again after mine wear from playing a few hundred times.<br />10 Stars!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself to be at least moderate, if not advanced.  I had a set of 5 lb. hand weights at home and decided to give it a shot, thinking with 5 lb. weights it would be easy.  HA!  She kicked my butt-even on level 1.  I have been doing this dvd on most days of the week for about 7 weeks now.  I have lost 18 lbs. and feel shredded!  (Mind you, I have been following weight watchers for diet for the same amount of time, so it is a combined effort!) But my body is definitely more toned and you can see definite muscles in my arms and shoulders, and abs!! Sometimes I do level 3, skip the cool down and go back to level 2 (skipping the warm up) for at least 1 or 2 circuits...just for a longer workout than the \\"20 minutes\\".  I would definitely recommend this dvd-especially if you have had some experience with weight lifting.  Not really for the beginner, though.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|This Blu-Ray came to me in excellent condition with only minor wear, and even then only on the sleeve (which my daughter promptly destroyed anyways...).  It also arrived in a timely manner from the seller.
B00135EUPC|5.0|This score is one of James Horner's absolute best.  It's an incredibly strong album with multiple epic and gorgeous themes, fantastic celtic and bagpipe music, thunderous battle music, and two of Horner's finest pieces of music (in my opinion):  For Love of a Princess, and Freedom...(this piece has a really long title, but it's track 17).  The whole album is full of wonderful music, but these two are the highlights.  The first starts softly and builds into an absolutely soul-stirring version of one of the main themes.  The second is a lengthy cue that recaps much of the thematic material from earlier in the score and contains the standout moment from the score.  This would be the music that accompanies Gibson's voice-over at the end of the film.  Two themes are eventually played simultaneously (one performed by a whole bunch of bagpipes) and work just beautifully off of one another.  The End Credits is fantastic.  I could say great things about nearly every track here.  Just buy it.

B001GCVFHI|4.0|An expression of the relationships between mother, daughter, and cultural differences, Amy Tan's novel The Joy Luck Club immerses its audience in a collection of short tales.  Like Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg Ohio, the literary mosaic connects several abstracts into one continuous exploration of the communal, yet separate, personal life account.  Unlike Anderson's tale, Tan has organized her narratives into a coherent, immediately understandable pattern: the stories of mothers, then daughters, and finally a confrontation in the daughters' adulthood lives and the issues newly prevalent to their current situations.  From the post-complete reading perspective, the observer can now step back to see the larger message Tan seems to convey through the redemption of newer generations reconciling with the older.      A quick read, the primary difficulty in interpretation being the required, constant effort to connect the names of protagonists to their specific stories.

0061537934|5.0|I just finished this one in just a few days.  It's the story of a family told from the perspective of the dog.  Enzo is a very perceptive dog who longs to communicate with his family, but can't, so he does the best he can do.    I swear you'd think that Garth Stein interviewed dogs to get such an insight into the world according to dogs.  He's gotten so far into the mind of Enzo, and told the story as he saw it.      Lovely.  All I want to do is talk to my dogs now, and hope they understand like Enzo did.
0938045695|5.0|The kettlebell is everything Pavel Tsatsouline advertises it to be. It is an excellent piece of exercise equipment. The Enter the Kettlebell book begins with quite a pep rally for the kettlebell.  After reading the first chapter, you will be ready to use your kettlebell.  Pavel concisely delivers all of the information required to perform a complete exercise regimen.     The moves involved in the kettlebell exercises appear simple, but are complex in that they require exact form. Pavel does well explaining and demonstrating the differences in proper and improper form. He even provides examples of poor form. The book includes information on how to work your way to proper form if you are not yet in good enough shape, or not flexible enough to perform the exercise.     Enter the Kettlebell is an excellent resource for those interested in the kettlebell for exercise.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The menus and play options are excellent: I can skip easily to the main menu, there is a \\"Play All\\" option on each disc and the overall feel is that the people who put the DVD package together liked the show as much as most fans of the series.    One very nice feature is having subtitles (so far - we're still in season 1): we are getting to read the dialogue that was occasionally missed during the original airings.  On that same topic, the subtitles don't always exactly match the spoken words of the actors.    The packaging is cutely done with folding manilla envelopes holding each season's discs, giving the whole thing the feel of a White House filing cabinet.
0552137030|3.0|Good Omens is a novel of wit and humour that takes the Revelations chapter of the Bible and uses it to poke fun at human foibles and pretensions. A heartwarming story at its core, it delivers a non-stop barrage of dry British humour that will have fans of Douglas Adams rolling on the floor. Requires some, but not a lot of, familiarity with British culture and regions. While its eschatological delving may not be profound, it delivers a steady stream of fun, satire and well-deserved ribbing of modern society. I'll never listen to Freddie Mercury in the same way again.
015206396X|4.0|Graceling was one of the best YA fantasy books that has been released in a long time. Channeling the greats, such as Tamora Pierce and C. S. Lewis, Kristin Cashore weaves a beautiful story together about life and love. You will fall in love with her characters and her world, never wanting to leave the story. I can't wait until the next books in the series are released.
0451450523|4.0|While The Last Unicorn may not be comparable to such classics as The Lord of the Rings or the Narnia series, it is nevertheless a beautiful glance into a fantastical world of strange creatures and wayward humans. Like The Circus of Dr. Lao, it bedecks itself in gorgeous mythological raiments but adds a twist of satire and self-deprecation to the mix to keep it from becoming pompous. The story stirs the heart and presents some mystifying symbolism (The Red Bull, the clock that must be entered) but seems to lose focus in some parts. Recommended for young adults or those new to the fantasy genre, but not quite as satisfying to experienced fantasy enthusiasts.
B00012QM86|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best Holocaust film made to date.  Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes give realism and breath to the people they portray, representing three very different men: charming businessman Oskar Schindler, Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, and sadistic Nazi Commandant Amon Goeth, respectively.      The movie begins in color, fading to black and white.  If it seems odd that a modern movie would be in black and white, sit back and savor it -- it only makes it better.  Spielberg does this deliberately, since all of the surviving Holocaust pictures and footage are in black and white. Schindler (Neeson) arrives in Krakow, Poland with one goal -- to make money. He's a charming man who makes friends easily, wines and dines the right people to get what he wants ... especially if it's a woman.  If somebody does him a favor, he tells them he's grateful -- showing his gratitude with fine gifts to keep his new ally on his side.  It doesn't hurt that he now has a large home in Krakow (stripped away from a wealthy Jewish family who were forced to move into the ghetto).       Every successful businessman needs a brilliant accountant.  Schindler immediately seeks out a reputable Jewish accountant by the name of Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), aware of his past managing successful businesses.  However, Stern is not impressed with Schindler and suspicious of Schindler's motives.  \\"The worse things get, the better you'll do,\\" he tells Schindler.  Nonetheless, Stern agrees and becomes Schindler's accountant and business manager.  Ben Kingsley, always an amazing actor, plays the man very well.  Stern convinces his employer to hire Jewish workers from inside the ghetto, saving many lives in the process.  He becomes Schindler's conscience without being preachy.  In one scene, Schindler is \\"entertaining\\" a woman in his bedroom when there is a knock on the door.  Schindler is angry, believing it is Stern who is disturbing him.  Except it isn't -- Stern has been taken away by the Nazis and put on a train headed to a concentration  camp.  Schindler races to the train station, endures the arrogance of Nazi officers who are less than accomidating, and manages to pull Stern from the train and save him from a no-doubt horrible fate.  His concern at this point is strictly monetary, since Stern runs the business.    Schindler witnesses the horrible, bloody liquidation of the ghetto.  The residents of the ghetto who aren't sent away to concentration  camps are relocated to Plaszow, a labor camp under the command of Amon Goeth, a Nazi commandant who takes delight in using Jewish prisoners as target practice.  Ralph Fiennes shows himself a wonderful actor here, even before he ever became Harry Potter's Voldemort.  The sight of Fiennes in this role is one that makes the viewer shudder with disgust -- the real man was evil, and Fiennes's eyes are cold, unfeeling in this role.  Unfortunately, in order to protect his workers, Schindler must work with Goeth and stroke the man's ego with a faux friendship, while providing Goeth with large amounts of money.  He does this in order to protect his workers.     The Schindler-Stern friendship is, in my opinion, the most important relationship in the movie.  It is the foundation for everything, the List included.  While Stern has been relocated to Plaszow, Schindler finds reasons to visit him, to check on him and bring him gifts that Stern can trade for survival.  When Goeth announces that the camp is to be shut down, that the prisoners are going to Auschwitz (Stern included), he is prompted to immediate action -- he and Stern gather in the office and the List is created.  \\"The List is life,\\" Stern says, \\"And all around its margins lies the gulf.\\"    Schindler relocates his 1,100 employees to Czechoslavakia, where they can breathe a sigh of relief in a safe location.  It is a haven for his workers, where nobody fears a summary execution -- Schindler doesn't even allow the soldiers inside the factory.  Schindler's munitions factory is, in fact, a sham ... the workers create nothing that will actually work, but live in safety with food and a warm place to sleep every night.  Stern is the accountant, keeping track of the money and which Nazi officials need to be bribed to maintain the utopian status quo.      The best scene, for me, is the scene where Schindler and Stern shake hands.  There's so much to say, but neither knows what exactly to say.  Stern presents Schindler with a gift (a ring, created from golden fillings) with an inscription -- \\"He who saves one life saves the world entire.\\"  Schindler puts the ring on his finger and then extends his hand to his friend.  Stern takes it, and Schindler covers Stern's hand with his own.  A wonderful scene, showing just how far their friendship had come.    The movie not only tells Schindler's story, but also some of the real people on the List, of what they endured before being rescued by Schindler.  There is some violence, but used only to depict the realism of Nazi brutality.  Spielberg creates a moving, wonderful tribute to the real Oskar Schindler in the epilogue and rounds out this movie quite nicely. Definitely an essential movie and one I'm happy I have in my collection.
0345347951|2.0|Although I have enjoyed many of Arthur C. Clarke's books, this is one that made almost no impression upon me. Perhaps I've gotten used to the conventions of the genre which this book in part set up from scratch, but knowing that a book was groundbreaking in its time and now simply reflects standard cliches does not make it any easier to enjoy. The aliens, despite their initially mysterious behaviour, turn out to be all-too-human and banal; the touching but rather juvenile faith in the UN and other world institutions that permeates most of the book reeks of 1950s transnationalism; and the mystical aspects of the book are rather amateurish and anti-intellectual. Compare this to Theodore Sturgeon's To Marry Medusa and you will find Childhood's End seems like an appetizer in comparison to the literary feast that Sturgeon presents on a similar topic. Unless you're eager to explore the antecedents of modern sci-fi cliches, I can't honestly recommend this novel.

B001J4E1D8|3.0|Did the screenwriter even read the novel?  Most of the dialogue was added or changed.  Scenes that had no basis in the novel were added.  And after she so cruelly rejects Alec, I simple HATED Tess!  Honestly, if you haven't read the novel, their relationship won't make any sense to you.  It seemed like a love story between them at first.  Then, after Alec leaves Tess alone in the wood, the way the next part is filmed, someone unfamiliar with the story might suspect this was simply a nightmare she was having.  And in the book, Tess then stays on with Alec for a few weeks.  In the film, it's like she was leaving the next day.  WHY??  The mini-series was ruined for me after that.      It's not terrible - Tess is beautiful, and there are some enjoyable parts.  But this is NOT Tess of the D'Urbervilles as Thomas Hardy wrote it.  See the 1979 film instead, or the 1998 one.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|The Concerts DVD documents another milestone in Barbra's career.    2006 is simply Streisand at 64. Fresh. Surprising. Intimate. Silly. Supreme. After a dozen viewings I'm thinking this is Barbra's greatest concert recording.    If you 'GET' Barbra, get the 2006 concert asap. I'm not giving any spoilers, keep the surprise for yourself.    My copy arrived from Amazon-UK mid March - who could wait? The inclusion of the '94 Anaheim Concert and Putting It Together (the making of the Broadway Album) makes this a must have set. The three UK discs are region free and PAL.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I had wanted to see this at the theater, but didnt get around to it.  It reminds me of the old style hollywood films of the 30's.  I found it very entertaining and a visual feast.  Lots of action, drama, and history all rolled up together.  Being an OZ fan didnt hurt either.
006135323X|5.0|I first fell in love with the title of the book so I ordered it.  After watching the videos from the author and reading his blog I was sold.  I immediately jumped into the book upon it's arrival and this book is a gold mine.  With excellent use of multiple studies and practical non-geek language this work is a must read for anyone who desires to understand the basics of why many are motivated to do what they do, as well as how to motivate others to do more than they do. Definitely worth a second and third read to grasp the most critical concepts that I need for what I do as a professional trainer.  If you are a student of NLP and human thought, this book is a must add to your library.  Besides would you rather pay $17.13 to read the Blue Side...$17.13 to read the Orange Side or $17.13 and Free Shipping to read Both Sides of this book?
015603283X|4.0|I bought this book 10 years ago when the movie \\"The Ninth Gate\\" came out. I find myself re-reading it at least once a year.

I may, once my Spanish improves dramatically, get a hardback copy in the original language and see how I enjoy that.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|This is the 4th album of one of my 3 favorite bands, and is not to say less but, this is a masterfull record, charged with all this enigmatic, even mysterious worlds that Opeth creat with them original riffs and scales.    This album talks about a particular men who has suffer the banish from his own town, only cause he lost all his faith on his religion.  He returns years later for his only true love Melinda, just to find that she becomes a nun, and there's where all the drama begins, making her fall in love again, and keeping the secret in shadows so the world dont see him, until the inevitable happens.    This edition is a 5.1 channel record to enjoy Opeth in all they glory, not my favortite of them, but surely it's one of the records that I most respect
B00005JKZ3|5.0|This sequel to a popular first film was a pleasant surprise to me. In fact, I think I like this better than the original, much better. Why? Well.....    1 - It is extremely entertaining and just an hour-and-half long; 2 - It has a much softer edge to it with more humor than the original; 3 - the special effects with the variety of little aliens are excellent; 4 - it's easier on the profanity than the first film, making this more kid-friendly; 5 - at 90 minutes the length of the movie is just right.    Yes, the story can be stupid at times, but so was the first one, and the good qualities listed above far outweigh that negative. Tommy Lee Jones is fun to watch again and Will Smith isn't as arrogant as he was in the first movie.    This is a no-brainer played strictly for laughs and it succeeds beautifully in that regard.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|absolutely awful! I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, but this movie was so bad i don't have a large enough vocabulary to properly express it. I wanted to turn this movie off 30 minutes in, but my friends kept saying it will get better; eventually after another 20 minutes or so they gave up too(thank god).
0790731940|4.0|A good mix of comedy, drama, suspense and nice scenery all make this a pleasing viewing experience. (Most people watching this leave with a smile on their face.)    This \\"western\\" is really a lot more of a comedy, but so was the TV show on which it was based. In the movie, we get some really neat twists at the end, too. Kudos also for including TV's original \\"Maverick\\" - James Garner - in this film.    Mel Gibson (the \\"new\\" Maverick) and Jodie Foster play off each other well in the leads and Graham Greene has some very funny lines as a supporting player. Alfred Molina, James Coburn, Geoffrey Lewis also shine in supporting performances and it is really fun to see all the cameo appearances in here. Included in there were a couple of old-time western movie stars along with country-western singers, all at a big card game at the end.    Another plus are the two songs during the ending credits. There is rousing C&W rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" followed by a good Randy Newman song called \\"Ride Gambler Ride.\\" They are worth sticking around and hearing.    One negative about this film: the message seems to be that cheating, lying and just being a dishonorable person if okay if you can get away with it!!  That's the movie business, for you!
B000026FJ6|4.0|The Songs of Distant Earth being Oldfield's 1994 release is based on<br />Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel Songs of Distant Earth and it sure is a dandy of a record. We can hear that he has taken cues from Enigma, Jean Michel Jarre, William Orbit and Vangelis.  The booklet is very nice and blends perfectly with the space theme. 4/5.
0590996835|5.0|\\"Matilda\\" was my favorite book in 2nd grade. So much so that every time I see it in any store, I HAVE to buy another copy. Matilda was my first full length book that I read over and over and over again. Even when it was falling apart, I still kept it, and lugged it to school every single day.<br />It is very well crafted and teaches young children to believe in themselves- don't let anyone hold you down- you can achieve anything!
B000000I0K|4.0|QE2 being Oldfield's 1980 release and his 6th studio album and contains tracks both by Oldfield himself and cover of other groups, i.e., Abba and the Shadows. These covers being \\"Arrival\\" by Abba and \\"Wondeful land\\" by the Shadows. The album did very well and topped the charts in Germany. The booklet has fine linernotes by Dave Laing in which he describes the album and how fared when it was released. We also get a nice list of whom and what they play on every track. 4/5.
B0011C78VU|5.0|Even besides all of the surrounding controversy I still adore this book. It is interesting, entertaining, introspective and so emotionally charged. It brings me to tears- even with its simplicity in writing style.  I was even engrossed in it enough that I went out and bought Tao Te Ching (which is so often reference through the story).<br />Look, I understand Mr Frey was using his \\"memoir\\" style to lure in the community to read his books.  It worked, didn't it?  Yes, it was dirty to say that he actually lived through all of this- and we were gullible enough to get duped into his system... HOWEVER, Mr Frey is STILL a talented writer.  He deserves the entitlement which is due to him.<br />Yes, I'm a bit mad at him- but I am also a bit impressed with him.  What a good idea!<br />haha, just kidding.  I promise.<br />Very well written- a bit like a rambleshack poem where it just goes on and on, but is broken up into very well placed sections.<br />I have read this three times and still enjoy it.

1843106698|5.0|There is a reason why I always recommend this book before all others for a person who wants to learn about Asperger's Syndrome. Dr. Attwood has a rare gift as a neurotypical (NT...non-autistic) author of being able to connect with both NT's and people on the spectrum. His writing resonates both with those who are on the spectrum and those who love the Aspies in their lives. Dr. Attwood is the preeminent expert on Asperger Syndrome in the world and has been for the last decade, having worked with thousands of AS clients. His knowledge and compassion are clear from the outset of the book and his user friendly writing style will appeal to laypeople who are just curious about Asperger's and the clinician, teacher, social worker or any other professional. It was Dr. Attwood's first book that I read as I wept with relief and happiness, first realizing that I had Asperger's, back in 2004. Dr. Attwood opened my eyes and helped me to understand who I was. For that, I am forever grateful. Thank you again, Dr. Attwood, for outdoing yourself with this fantastic book!

B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|The Jesse Stone series is terrific entertainment, well written and acted. Would highly recommend every title in the series.<br />  If you are a frequent Amazon customer and accustomed to fast service I'd suggest staying away from the seller ( dvdlegacy ). I purchased two of the Jesse Stone titles to give as gifts and after 15 days of waiting tried to contact this seller to find out why there was a delay. I have yet to get a response from them and the dvds I purchased also have not arrived. I have purchased nearly two hundred titles on Amazon and am used to deliveries within 10 days or less and can see no logical reason why it should take any longer. I also have always gotten a quick reply on the few questions I've had for the various sellers. This delay may have been explainable had the seller paid notice to my message. Since they see no need to respond to their customers I will obviously give them bad feedback when and if my purchase ever arrives.

0385340990|4.0|Very insightful book, a few too many short one line letters though. Otherwise a good book.
B001PI8U2Q|5.0|I LOVE this book. It does deal in generalizations, so you can take some of it w/ a grain of salt. Most of it is pretty dead on if you've ever had a string of failed relationships and/or jerks. I easily identified to several of the scenarios (although all people being different, the level of connectivity will differ). It's written with some humor, so it's very easy to read and you don't feel like you're reading a boring self-help text book. If you find yourself getting mixed signals from your love interests, this book gives great insight and you can save yourself a lot of heart-ache.
B001RI3DZI|1.0|Two great actors with a really bad script, there was no suspense or a build up to understand why the characters did what they did. Both actors would have been better off playing against each other, De Niro should have played the part that Leguizamo played. The ending was bad, bad ,bad.

B0000U5RNU|3.0|Rowan Atkinson does a fine job spoofing James Bond in this light (did I say light?)...make that \\"silly, silly, silly\\" flick.<br /><br />A mishap lands Johnny English (Atkinson) in the job of his dreams as England's #1 secret agent.  His overwhelming incompetence and nonstop silliness is at the same time endearing and, to some viewers, revolting.  English nevertheless presses on in bungling attempts to solve mystery after mystery in an effort to save Queen and country.<br /><br />English's supporting crew includess his somewhat competent assistant, and the obligatory ravishing beauty/love interest(?).<br /><br />Viewers should be advised that there are a few scenes where the south side of a north bound male is shown...just FYI (perhaps making this only a questionable option for the younger crowd).<br /><br />All in all I have to say that this is a fun show, but one that just about everyone except dedicated Rowan Atkinson fans will be happier renting and watching once instead of buying -- that's my main criterion for a 3-star rating.  So, 3 stars!
B001N26GFC|5.0|No this is not deep cinema, no it's not an action film, no it's not a jiggle film, no...it's not a lot of things. What Happy Go Lucky is, a wonderful small film that just makes a person feel good. It stands proudly and says, there is good in people everywhere, it just depends on how you look at them. And this film just made this reviewer feel good at the end.<br /><br />The flim opens with credits rolling and Poppy, the central character of the film, riding her bicycle around a city in England. The director chose to use an older 60's / 70's technique of moving a rectangular box around the screen and placing the credits in the black space.<br /><br />Poppy parks her bicycle on the street, goes inside a book store. At this moment it is clear, Poppy looks at life differently from most people. It is driven home when she walks out of the store to find her bicycle stolen. She stands for a few seconds, and she says, &#34;oh shoot, I didn't even get to say goodbye to you.&#34; Obviously, Poppy's view of the world is different, and maybe very healthy.<br /><br />The fear of this moment in the film, where a character reacts in a quirky happy manner, is that they will be a Pollyanna, or they are insane. Mike Leigh, the director and writer, toed a very difficult line in making Poppy at once loveable and happy, but not overboard. Poppy doesn't walk around smiling vapidly everywhere. She gets genuinuely upset at certain things, cares deeply about what happnes around her, but then can smile at the good that comes out of an unfortunate event. Poppy remains somebody that everyone would love to have around.<br /><br />Frankly, describing more of the story would simply harm the lovely discovery of this film. Getting to know Poppy, Zoey, Poppy's two sisters, Scot the driving instructor, the Flaminco dance instructor... all the characters, is the best part of this film.<br /><br />Remember, this is a small film. It probably had a very low budget, filmed on the inexpensive side of movies. It is not a GREAT film. There are some pacing issues here and there. Shots aren't always in perfect focus. But where production and film style matter, Mike Leigh brings it on. The shots in the car, a virtually impossible place to shoot film, are remarkable. The close ups as each actor speaks are for film school study. The music is a bit over the top most of the time. The strings and orchestra overemphasize some parts of the film. However, the sound in the very last scene is incredible, and there music is used to perfection.<br /><br />If you want a film that will make you happy, will make you feel good when it is over - Happy Go Lucky is perfection.<br /><br />The film is could have been PG, it is just oh so close (darn MPAA). But one of the most important scenes near the end of the the film, there is some very strong language that lasts for not even 30 seconds. There is an incredibly sensuous scene, but with absolutely no nudity. Frankly, that scene has to be one of the best romantic scenes the reviewer has seen in a very long time. There is absolutely no violence of any kind. Honestly, if it weren't for those inane MPAA rules about the F bomb (more than two), this film would be PG-13.<br /><br />The DVD is presented with a few previews and no bonus features. The transfer is magnificant.. It is not a GREAT film. There are some pacing issues here and there. Shots aren't always in perfect focus.

B001EYU1VO|5.0|Replaced my previous X-52 Saitek with this stick-  Much simpler and just as effective with FLTSMX and add-ons. User friendly but I think the base design could be improved upon The \\"tri-corner\\" design tends to distort your input when attempting to make minor control inputs.    Have no regrets however and recommend it highly. Based on it's quality I am going to replace my CH rudder pedals with a set of Saiteks.
0545128285|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the HP series but I must say I had low expectations from this book, since before it came out there was a lot of talk about it being some kind of merchandizing/fund raising stunt and not having a real value by its own. I picked it up at an airport for my girls and then forgot all about it. This week (on another trip actually...) I took it out again and to my surprise and delight it turned out to be a pure pleasure of reading. It seems that JKR simply can't do a poor job... the five stories themselves are extremely original, witty, touching, poignant and surprising, and in the case of the Warlock's Hairy Heart, downright creepy! This is the same style and quality that made HP such a huge success. Unlike other reviewers, I liked less the so called Dumbledore side notes, while they are sometimes interesting I don't think they contribute a lot and they repeat a lot of themes and explanations already covered in the books themselves. Bottom line, the 5 tales stand in their own as a great reading, and the biggest complaint, of course, is that there only so few of them! The real good news are that JKR didn't yet loose her magic touch (no pun intended), and I truly hope we get to enjoy more from her in the future, either within the HP world or outside of it.

1853261580|5.0|This classic little book that will never go out of style is digestible in one sitting, but the lessons learned will last a lifetime. I first read The Little Prince as a child and several times since then, and each time, the story's meaning was relevant and easy to identify with for that period in my life. I most recently used part of the Prince's conversation with the fox as a reading at my wedding. It really speaks to how people cherish each other, and relate to each other; this book's message has become part of the foundation of my marriage.

B00004XMV6|1.0|Clearly anyone who read the novel of NINE AND A HALF WEEKS will not enjoy the film version.  The casting of Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke would get one's hopes up...but the writing and direction completely undermines them.<br /><br />This is not a story that should play like a 1980s MTV video.<br /><br />Let me repeat that again, THIS IS NOT A STORY THAT SHOULD PLAY LIKE A LAME 1980S MTV VIDEO.<br /><br />But it does.  The filmmakers took a dark, erotic story where a woman is temporarily liberated by her sexuality just before she's degraded and enslaved to the breaking point and instead made a sleek, empty love story, devoid of characters and their power plays.<br /><br />I blame this film for the career of Zalman King or whatever his name was and all the terrible \\"erotic films\\" where the sex scenes are filmed with blinding, flashing lights, blaring, obnoxious saxophones, and spastic, jerky editing.<br /><br />Check out SECRETARY with Maggie Gylenhaal and James Spader, a straight forward film about sexual power plays and kinkiness without the ridiculous light shows and blasting music.<br /><br />Maybe someone will someday remake NINE AND A HALF WEEKS and just film the story.

0307245306|4.0|This book is a little bit like Harry Potter, but it's more on the level of the first HP book. The premise is that the gods of Greek mythology are still alive, and the children they have with mortals spend their summers at \\"Camp Half Blood.\\" There's lots of homage to Greek mythology, and the story is more campy fun than the HP books. If you go into it expecting something light, you'll enjoy it. Some people have posted negatively about the narrator of the audiobook, but I think he does a good job, especially pulling off Percy's dry humor.

0525951113|3.0|This is a tough review because unlike a lot of current \\"thriller\\" writers who are writing unconvincingly characters in situations that seem cribbed from a how-to book, DAEMON is actually built on a real plausible premise and clearly its opening scenario is enticing in its possibilities but ultimately, the author wanted his first novel to make some huge statement and instead of just finishing the story he started to write, he drifts off into trying to make some Matrix-like statement about living life as a drone - so first 15 chapters, 5 stars - rest of book, 1 star.    Without giving away too many spoilers, what starts out as CSI turns quickly into the poor man's Matrix. What was an interesting premise based on a real and plausible computer scenario turns a pointless simplistic scifi world where everything is and is not what it seems to be.    My guess is the author didn't wanted to be pegged as another detective serial novelist & he wanted to show off that he can think big but by chapter 16, it heads downhill fast because while the story got bigger and bigger, his writing became more and more unconvincing ... either he decided he wanted to save it for book two or he was genuinely out of ideas and ultimately ruined what started out an interesting story.    He should have just trusted his own story but instead, he creates a unconvincing much bigger and broader Matrix-like world but since the book is very short, he doesn't go very deep. Of course, his main premise is that a supersmart egomanical genius can forever out think the world ... which of course is laughable ... we know that is not true (just look at Microsoft, it took 10,000 programmers 8 years to figure out how to block about 50% of the viruses) ... in other words, idiots will defeat smart eventually ... so asking us to buy the main premise of this book means the author is simplistic or maybe it's just poor writing ... so a good solid effort but essentially an unconvincing exercise in scifi weirdness after about 100 pages ...     Another flaw the author should work on - bland naming of characters and confusion in naming the main protaganist and antagonist with similiar names.
6304696566|5.0|This movie is ranked the 7th best or 12th best movie of all time, depending on which list you read, and usually #1 in the Westerns category, even though it was not all that popular when released in 1956. Shot in northern Arizona's famous Monument Valley on the Navajo Reservation, Director John Ford and actor John Wayne created a huge iconic movie that has now influenced Westerns and movies in general for over 50 years. In the movie, they pretend they are in Texas.       This film shows John Wayne at his best: moody or friendly, a loner or a family man, angry but kind and gentle, hard and soft, and so on. He plays his character nearly perfectly, and the relentless search that goes on for years is an overpowering theme throughout the movie. The ending is very touching and worth watching over and over.       Trivia: in the film, Wayne says THAT'LL BE THE DAY  many times. After seeing the movie, Buddy Holley wrote the song with the same title. Also: at the end of the film, Wayne stands on the porch alone, holding his right elbow with his left arm across his stomach, a clear tribute to Harry Carey Sr., who was Wayne's favorite actor, and whose wife Olive, and son Harry Jr. (both are IN this film)were behind the camera watching. It was a trademark gesture of Carey Sr. in other films. And Debbie, played by Natalie Wood, is played by Natalie Woods younger sister as a little girl at the very beginning. The rest of the supporting cast is loaded up with stars that we all know and love.       In America, we knew that all of the West did not look at all like this spectacular, grand scenery, but the rest of the world, particularly England, latched on to these images, and to this day they believe this is what the West is like. (see the cover on the Led Zeppelin DVD    HOW THE WEST WAS WON, as an example.) If you go to Monument Valley for a tour, you can stand in numerous spots in the area, and realize this is exactly where they shot this scene in the movie from. Or a host ofother movies, such as STAGECOACH, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, FORT APACHE...even 2001, A SPACE ODESSY was partly shot there.       Overall, a great, iconic, spectacle of a Western and dramatic movie that has a well deserved high ranking in the minds of tens of millions of movie watchers worldwide. I have always given it 5 stars!
0142437611|5.0|Tommy Wilhelm, the protagonist of SEIZE THE DAY, has many problems. He is a mid-career salesman who is out of a job and desperate for money. The demands of his estranged and icy wife, in combination with his own guilt, are close to crushing him. And, the people he can turn to in his time of need have their own agendas. These are Dr. Adler, his aloof and elderly father who wants no part of his son's confusion; and Dr. Tamkin, a money-short beguiler whose crazy presence and conversation occasionally pops with insight.<br /><br />In most of SEIZE THE DAY, Bellow illuminates Tommy's difficult situation with playful philosophical humor (\\"Maybe the making of mistakes expressed the very purpose of his life and the essence of his being.\\") and great characters. Here, for example, is Tommy considering Dr. Tamkin, who presents himself as a psychologist, deep-thinker, and commodities expert: \\"So many questions impossible to answer could not be asked about an honest man. Nor perhaps about a sane man. Was Tamkin a lunatic, then? That sick Mr. Perls at breakfast had said that there was no easy way to tell the sane from the mad...\\"<br /><br />Then, in the final few pages, Tommy's impression of Tamkin clarifies and he has confrontations with his father and wife. And, the pain held at bay with the humor (\\"You can spend the entire second half of you life recovering from the mistakes of the first half.\\") emerges. The novella ends with a great scene, profound and affecting, that exposes the needy Tommy.<br /><br />Bellow has amazing touch in SEIZE THE DAY and is able to examine serious issues and real characters with humor and warmth. At the same time, Bellow has a wonderful break-all-the-rules style. Many paragraphs, for example, begin with omniscient narration, jump to first-person, and then back to third, whatever suits him. And, Bellow writes to capture energy, insight, and humor, which sometimes exist only because he writes in fragments or his sentences don't parse perfectly. His style demonstrates that grammar, and a fear of mistakes, can be the enemies of expression.<br /><br />Highly recommended.at grammar, and a fear of mistakes, can be the enemies of expression.

031606792X|4.0|I am an newbie in the twilight world as I did not read these books till recently. I must say I was so in love with the characters that I read continesly from start to finish of this series in just a few days. I was really worried about breaking dawn with all the uproar about burning the books. I am delighted to say I think the uproar is crazy. I loved the book and thought the conclusion answered my questions and has left me wanting more from this series in any form including midnight sun if it comes to be.   As far as the uproar over the baby. Seriously a high percentage of people want the happy ending of love, then wedding, then baby. Its a natural progression for most great love. I also saw tons of uproar over a so called anti abortion theme and I did not get that feel at all. I think there are plenty of women who chose a babies life even if it risks their own. To say that bella keeping the baby that was sucking the life out of her is anti abortion themed seems a bit off it is a pro choice world we are in and she made her choice as she saw fit. While the whole biting the baby out was a little different but really its a fictional vampire story.   As far as jacob imprinting on the newborn. I was not really all that surprised especially since earlier on there was an imprinting on a little girl and they explained that it w as not always a romantic notion. I was glad that Jacob found a purpose other than bella. Lastly the complaint that the souls being damned was not concluded I felt like the fact that they were able to have a baby meant that their souls were not damned. I am a happy ending person so I loved this conclusion to the story. If it were to end in tragedy then I may have felt my investment in the series was wasted. I loved the whole series and cant wait to watch the movies and I truly hope that all of the books including breaking dawn make it to the big screen.

Not everyone's style, but it is a release for me and connects me to my emotions.      Although I am disappointed that Damien is no longer (professionally?) associated with Lisa Hanniagn anymore, and I am worried about his future viability, this album is beautiful in its rawness and vulnerablity.    \\"Accidential Babies\\" is my favorite.  Live, Damien started this song and had to stop.  He was choked up and moved on to another song. One can only imagine what events prompted to the creation of this song.

Every song hits a chord , some of my favorites being \\"affection\\", \\" what did i do to you\\" \\" sincerity\\" and \\"when are you coming back\\" .  here it is 20 years later and i am still grooving to Lisa.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I am a true fan of Stargate SG1 & Atlantis, so anything that will keep the story going is important.  This feature episode meet the criteria to keep the story going, so I have to rate it very highly.<br />[[ASIN:B0017MO10U Stargate: Continuum]]
B001PJ7TUE|4.0|I like all of Prodigy's albums, and \\"Invaders Must Die\\" is no different. In a reverse trend, the band reverts to their earlier sounds found on \\"Experience\\" and \\"Music For The Jilted Generation\\" with break-neck beats and synth swashes all around. They borrow Dave Grohl from the The Foo Fighters for drumming on two tracks \\"Run With The Wolves\\" and \\"Stand Up\\".<br /><br />But, is \\"Invaders Must Die\\" any different from what the band has already establish? Does the band attempt to push the musical limits of their genre? Is this cd better than \\"Music For The Jilted Generation\\" or \\"Fat Of The Land\\"? The answers to all of these questions is no. What the band has done is made a fine techno album. All of the songs are good. I can't pick any that are better than the others. I do think it was a waste of space to put \\"Omen (Reprise)\\". I didn't get why they felt the need to add that track. Otherwise, the remaining ten tracks are all serviceable and solid, if not wholly original or inventive. Like a frozen tv dinner, you know what you will get.<br /><br />I just keep thinking that this band, who has been around for almost 20 years now, could really do more. They could mix more genres and twist them into some grotesque techno nightmare, but the band is content here with their old reliable tricks. I wanted \\"Invaders\\" to hit harder than it does, to be edgier and sharper than it turns out to be. Maybe next time. But do I have to wait another four years?<br /><br />Here's my comparison chart for \\"Invaders Must Die\\":<br /><br />1992 Experience: Three Stars<br />1994 Music For The Jilted Generation: Four and a Half Stars<br />1997 Fat Of The Land: Four and a Half Stars<br />2004 Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned: Four Stars<br />2009 Invaders Must Die: Four Stars
0061170623|5.0|Loosing my nearsightedness have me resorting to audiobooks, and this \\"book\\" is a big, big winner in the listening part. I love the dialect in this book but it was a hard read for me. Alex's stories have just to be told this way and Tom Hollander is the best reader there is. I highly recommend the audiobook over the handheld book.

If you have been wondering what was the method behind the madness of world economic and political change over the past 40 years, then this book is a must read. Her research into the repeating patterns of change due to the implementation of fundamentalist capitalism reveals why throughout the world we are still regarded as the \\"Ugly Americans\\".
B001HPP2XW|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is one of those movies which  - thanks to an infrequent movie-going habit,  parents who did not permit much television watching, and twenty years spent overseas watching AFRTS where the movies on offer were  not top tier -  I had never seen, or at least, never watched from beginning to end. So I could come to view it without much in the way of preconceptions, and to see it more or less fresh, save for seeing actors like George Peppard and Patricia Neal as almost impossibly young, younger than I had ever seen them before.<br />It all stands up very well - all but Mickey Rooney with grotesquely oversized buck-teeth, as the Japanese super of a pleasant New York apartment building. Fifty years later, that is a cringe-inducingly offensive bit of stereotyping and stunt casting, a small grubby fly-spot on an otherwise light and airy angel-cake slice of movie.<br /><br />That it was based on a novel perhaps accounts for a certain kind of dense, and complex feel to it, a sense that all the various characters encountered - some of them just fleetingly in a single scene - have or had their own lives, interests and affections. There are a thousand more stories, behind every window on the quiet street of comfortable brownstone apartments, and a sense that every person at Holly's cocktail party, the salesman behind the counter at Tiffany's, and the fussy librarian has their very own enormously interesting life story. At the heart of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is an ill-assorted pair of neighbors. Perhaps they are not as ill assorted as all that, for they are both being kept, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. Semi-failed writer Jack is more or less the designated boy-toy of a wealthy married woman who has installed him in the apartment for her convenience. And Holly Golightly - elegant and dizzily charming - lives by her wits and charm, cadging fifty dollars at a time from a circle of escorts and visiting an imprisoned mobster once a week. She has a cat, an all-but unfurnished apartment, and a tendency to flee emotional involvement - with anyone.  Her ambitions, if any, are wistful ones about making a home for herself and her younger brother, or marrying a very rich man. Very gradually and naturally, Jack and Holly become acquainted, trust each other, become friends and then realize that they love each other. In real life, love grows in a manner much more like this, much more often than the instant, shake'n'bake romance, which may account for the appeal of this move over the decades since.<br /><br />Extras are a rather mixed lot: there is strange little feature about cocktail parties, featuring a reunion of the various actors cast as the guests at Holly's lively cocktail party, reminiscing about their bits of business. It was a very complex bit of shooting, and took up more than a week; if you go back and watch that segment very carefully, you will appreciate all the minor stories happening there. Another feature is a sort of retrospective on portrayals of Asians in the movies, and the (to late 20th-century movie fans) the bizarre and unconvincing penchant for casting Caucasian actors in Asian roles. There is also a feature about Tiffany's, and a lovely memory by the writer of the company history of Audrey Hepburn writing a graceful dedication page for it. Ms Hepburn and her fashion sense are the focus of yet another. (She did indeed dress beautifully, in ageless and flattering clothes that still look up-to-this-minute current. Any of her gowns and outfits could be worn today without appearing the least bit dowdy or unfashionable.)unfurnished apartment, and a tendency to flee emotional involvement - with anyone.

B000AP04NI|5.0|You just can't go wrong with an Oscar and Hammerstein musical! Great music, great cast, great fun! One of the best of the best in musicals. Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae made the cutest couple in this film. All the supporting cast is wonderful. If you haven't seen this musical (and you love musicals) -- what are you waiting for?!
B0012EM5D8|1.0|Well, chalk this up to truth in advertising; seriously, Bee Movie is exactly that. A \\"B\\" movie, especially when stacked up against an \\"A\\" movie like Antz, or \\"Bugs' Life\\" or even more recent fare like \\"Ratatouille\\". Woody Allen sending up himself as an ant unhappy with the way the colony was organized - that was original; Jerry Seinfeld picturing himself as a bee, ditto  is just derivative. And the interaction with humans in Ratatouille - that was worked out in a much more logically amusing way. At least it seemed that a rat could be a chef... but millions of bees landing a passenger jet. Oh, well, back to the cartoon drawing board.<br /><br />It's not that the talents thrown into `Bee Movie\\" were lightweight or inconsiderable. There was a handful of A-list talent: besides Seinfeld himself and the vocal talents of Renee Zellweger, Rip Torn and Matthew Broderick, plus hundreds of hours of skilled computer animation talent, presumably endless scripts rewrites and conferences around the story board. All of which added up to an inoffensive and inconsequential  bit of movie DVD fluff, as forgettable as something on television a couple of nights ago that you weren't very interested in anyway. A show about nothing, as Mr. Seinfeld himself so memorably quipped of the television vehicle that carried him into celebrity. I watched Bee Movie and the extras (and there is a whole generous disc of extras included for those fans who couldn't get enough bee comedy in the movie) last weekend, and frankly took nothing particularly memorable away from the experience - although the series of sketches that Seinfeld did to promote Bee Movie were a few degrees funnier and fresher than the movie itself.
B00011D1OA|4.0|My Fair Lady is a good film and definitely worth watching. Storyline is good up until the ending. For some reason, the ending is flat for me. At that point, Hepburn becomes shrewish and Harrison becomes odious (it's hard to imagine a happy marriage blooming from this pair). But, the music is wonderful and Hepburn's gowns are exquisite. Excellent supporting cast.
0385474547|3.0|Apparently, this book is widely read among high school and college students all over the world,this shows the importance of the novel.  Chinua Achebe's goal is to depict a different side of Igbo culture in contrast to colonial literature, such as the works of Rudyard Kipling.  The novel succeeds in proving that the Igbo were not merely \\"savages\\" but were part of an organized, well structured society that included its own form of religion and government. Throughout the novel, the underlying themes of arrogance, racism and internal conflict are showcased.  The book reads sometimes like an educational text instead of a creative novel.  The messages presented are important, yet I don't feel that I am drawn to it as it lacks a certain type of creativity.  Some authors, for instance Virginia Woolf can write a novel about basically nothing and with her genius, it is captivating and moving.  That is the style of writing that I enjoy.  I feel that this novel is important because of the subject matter, and not the actual style or interest level.  I would recommend this novel to instructors for classroom discussion, but for personal enjoyment, I would skip this novel.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|This is just a simply incredible documentary that I have watched repeatedly.  No voices...or words I mean(there are plenty of voices).  But the seamless transistion between the nature scenes, to the assembly lines, to the cities in time-lapse are brilliant.  The music seems to blend instruments from everywhere into one orchestra.  Questioning your Faith?  This video documents people of all faiths...for centuries...and will make you question your own existence.  Simply amazing.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|[[ASIN:B000I5YCCO Taylor Swift]]  This album is much more than just a vehicle for a few hit songs. It is a surprisingly well rounded total with 14 great songs (I could have done without the pop version for Teardrops, but as an oddity it may be of interest to some). 'Tim McGraw' and 'Teardrops on my Guitar' ring out cristally clear in this intimately recorded album, but the less wel known tracks provide as much pleasure. Listen for instance to 'Stay beautiful'.    Miss Swift's voice soars effortlessly over the subtle arrangements of her own compositions. I am not specifically into country, but I find myself going back to this particular cd repeatedly.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Although I was knowledgeable about the crucifixion of Jesus, the impact of this movie was huge. Why? Well, knowing is one thing, understanding is another. Because of the graphic depiction of the insults, beatings and suffering by Jesus during the Passion, came understanding. Understanding more of the price that He freely paid in order to redeem all though who will acccept the FREE gift of life.    My prayer is that this movie will be re-released so multitudes more will understand the price of this FREE Gift . . . .
0553381687|5.0|I read A Game Of Thrones after reading many five-star reviews on Amazon. What many reviews did not mention, is that you should read this book with caution. I was expecting that it would upset many of the fantasy cliches, but I did not expect to be slapped in the face by this book. The \\"good characters\\" do not always win. Some of the things that happened, made me want to throw the book down and stop reading. However, all of the hardship only adds to the greatness of this book.<br /><br />I have not read much fantasy, but I have read enough to know what cliches annoy me. This book avoids all of them. It is very realistic. In fact, it is so real, that it has very little \\"fantastic\\" elements in it. Almost everything that happens (except for a few parts), could have really happened in our own medieval history. Some may not enjoy that aspect of the story, but I did. You may have read other reviews that mention the gore and sex in this book. There is some, but not an excessive amount. It may not be appropriate for children, or immature teens, but for a mature child, I believe that this book may be fine.<br /><br />If you want to read a new and wonderful fantasy book, this is it. A Game Of Thrones was an extremely entertaining, and heart wrenching, story. I highly recomend this great book. I have not read the rest of the series yet, but I definitely will.
B00004W221|4.0|On the one hand, this is a formula movie. Poor boy has challenges; poor boy works hard; poor boy ends up successful. The movies pulls all the strings just right, so that the person viewing this movie is pulled along by sentiment and a well crafted script and sound track.<br /><br />The sound track needs to be mentioned.  It works quite well.  The movie shows Notre Dame football practice and games during the change of seasons.  Rudy, played by Sean Astin, is undersized and undertalented, but he has great desire to play for the Fighting Irish. He becomes a practice team fixture, hanging on by his fingernails because of his desire and hustle. The movie shows him desperate to attend Notre Dame and having to gain access to the University. His family is working class and can't really help him. There is an element of Horatio Alger here, as \\"poor boy makes good,\\" although the \\"good\\" is not the massing of wealth.<br /><br />The ending is wonderfully manipulative--but very effective. The emotions wash over the viewer. This is an engaging movie, with many fine performances by the actors. If you like sports movies, this is worth looking at.

B001PU8NEE|5.0|Fantastic! Utterly fantastic! It is so easy to see why Pure garnered the \\"Album of the Year\\" at the Classic Rock Society Awards. This CD is stellar from start to finish. What never ceases to amaze me is how Nick Barrett can release CD after CD that are each classics in their own rights. The quality of music that is consistently delivered by Pendragon is nothing short of amazing. We always have to wait 3 or 4 years for a new Pendragon release but boy is the wait always worth it!    I cannot even review Pure \\"cut by cut\\" because each track seems to eclipse the one which precedes it. You are immediately caught up in this CD with in the first minute and it only gets better from there.  Nick's voice and guitar playing have never sounded better. His great accent is alive and well. Clive Nolan again puts in a legendary keyboard performance. Scott Higham replaces Fudge Smith on drums (who was no slacker himself) and his drumming nearly eclipses Mike Portnoy. Round this out with Peter Gee's rock solid bass and Pure is a tour de force.    Pendragon has carved out their own sound over the years, so to try to categorize them in \\"Genesis, Pink Floyd, or Yes categories\\" (which so often happens) is a crime. As new Prog bands come along we should start saying that they sound like Pendragon!    I cannot recommend this CD strongly enough. If you do not obtain a copy you are missing one of the best Prog albums to come along in the past year, if not two. I don't pass out 5 stars freely, but in the case of Pure I would give it a 6 if I could!!
B000FA5MUI|4.0|When I got my Kindle I quickly decided that a Vonnegut novel would be the first thing I read, like christening a new ship. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a superb book, and it remains one of my favorites even 30 years after I first read it. This digital edition, however, needs some heavy proofing by a copy editor. In most-- if not all!-- instances, trailing double quote marks do not immediately follow the final letter or punctuation mark. Instead, they are shifted one space to the right and appear before the first letter of the next word. This frequently gives the appearance of a new character speech, when the author intends only narrative. This is compounded by the author's own use of the word 'Papa' in double quotes. The problem is not a deal killer, but it causes the reader to back up and re-read many sentences to get them back into the proper context, thus yanking the reader frequently out of the story being spun.    5-star book brought back one star due to a bad digital conversion.

0141182865|5.0|I read this a few years ago and had hoped to buy a Kindle version with intent of reading it again.  Too bad it is not available in Kindle format, yet.  This book is wonderful from start to finish.  How it has managed to generate so few reviews is quite beyond me as numerous works of rather mediocre fiction have somehow acquired hundreds of comments.<br /><br />When a book has \\"Winner of the Pulizer Prize\\" emblazoned on the cover, you can be sure it is a great read.  Read this book!  Oh and click that little link to request the publisher format and sell it for Kindle owners, so I can read it again.
1595141715|3.0|I think the plot of this book is awesome.  How interesting to record the last moments of the life of a suicidal teen.  It could have given us so much insight into the signs and solutions of such desperate children.  Unfortunately, the storyline fell short of any such insight.  Very short.  Surely, the author must have known that the reader would hate Hannah Baker.  Did he honestly think we'd pity her?  She was a whining, self-absorbed drama queen.  These are the types that threaten to kill themselves, but never do.  They just talk about it, milking everyone of as much sympathy as possible and then creating major theatrics when their targets don't follow the script.  I have done extensive research on suicide for a newspaper feature I wrote once.  I learned that suicide occurs when the pain outweighs the ability to cope.  Hannah Baker created her own pain.  She staged her own downfall in order to collect more pity.  She had some major issues, but they were psychological and internal and had nothing to do with the people on the list.  Are there people out there like that?  Absolutely.  But are they the ones who follow through with suicide?  Not likely.  Tape after tape, I waited for the major crime committed by each person on the list.  Tape after tape, I was disappointed, left to wonder what on earth the climax was.  If anything, the victims were the people on the list and Hannah, the villain.  Because she was such a self-centered little head case, incidents far worse than her own occurred.  She sat by feeling sorry for herself while another girl was raped only a few feet away.  Does she report it?  No, because she wants to be the victim, not the poor girl unconscious on the bed.  She failed to call the police right away when a stop sign was knocked over, causing the death of a young boy.  A week later, she strips down to her underwear and gets into a hot tub with the same guy she saw raping someone else.  No surprise what happens there.    I gave this 3 stars insteadof 1 because the book created a reaction and opinion in me.  It created controversy.  That's a positive quality in a book.  But I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 because of the weak storyline.  I wanted to care at the end of each tape.  I wanted to pity the girl.  Instead, I only felt annoyed that she (and the author) wasted my time.  I also rated it low for the dull, lifeless characters.  None of them had any substance and none of them sounded like teenagers.  I did kind of like Tony, but he seemed to be thrown in as an afterthought.    Despite this low rating of Thirteen Reasons Why, I do believe that Jay Asher has real potential as a continual author.  I look forward to his next book but sincerely hope he strengthens his contextual style.
B001CZVVVY|1.0|I had great hopes when I bought this disc but they were soon dispelled when I started to watch. I already have several DVD versions of this masterpiece in my collection - for me the best one by far was directed by Jean Pierre Ponnelle in a film studio, back in early 1980s. This blue-ray production borders on being an artistic travesty. It is so bad that I have given it only a one-star rating, the lowest I have ever given an opera on either DVD or Blue-ray. This disc's only redeeming quality is that it is technically  excellent - the video direction is exemplary and the DTS-HD 5.1 soundtrack  outstanding.  Unfortunately, the stage direction and overall presentation are among the worst I have ever seen. It is puzzling that a conductor with the experience and knowledge of Nikolaus Harnoncourt would ever agree to be associated with it. The staging is an unmitigated disaster as are the custumes. The addition of a cherub is both distracting and ridiculous - the stage director (Claus Guth) would have been very wise to present the work the way Mozart wrote it. If this is the best Mr. Guth can do then I think he ought to seriously consider an early retirement and not inflict his bizarre intrepretation of great operas on an unsuspecting public. Quite honestly, the custumes were far too austere and bordered on the absurb. The less written about the monochromatic sets and complete absence of elegant furniture the better.

B000P46QTA|5.0|This is the story of a good man.<br /><br />Every once in a long while a movie will comes along that a five star rating is just not good enough. This is one of those movies. Based on true environments you can immediately connect with the characters and the story.  If you do not speak fluent German, it may take some time to get use to the subtitles, however soon you do not realize your are reading; for others you may notice that the subtitle may not quite match but are close enough that you just do not care. What you care for is what they are saying and doing.<br /><br />The date 1984. The place East Berlin. In an intolerable situation, people are committing suicide.  A well know playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), after having a friend Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert )commit suicide, is compelled to tell the western world  the truth about the situation. The Stasi (East German Spy system) suspects the playwright's motives, and keeps an eye on him. The person in charge of surveillance Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he) is also under surveillance gets involved with &quot;The Lives of Others.&quot;<br /><br />The playwright smugly thinks he is not being watched. However, we know he is not only watching him but an unlikely guardian angel also helps him. This angle also learns about love and true friendship of which he is personally lacing in the intolerable world of the DDR.<br /><br />For people interested in Blu-ray many of the scenes were quite graphic. Not as much thee blood and guts scenes as people's faces and the face of the DDR. The filmmakers had to clean the graffiti off the buildings daily for the film. The film also shows actual locations.<br /><br />By the way, I heard the film commentary is in English

B001AZI1W8|2.0|I'm a Rihanna fan but I don't get this Hairdo that she has here. Its 80's and so bad. Really not sexy like she was when she came out in 2005. Also, why is she going in a rock direction on this concert? She is an astounding RnB/Pop artist and does not need to add loud guitars in her mix. The guitars actually detract bigtime from this performance. However, Her voice is perfect and the sound and visual quality are top notch. The show is non-stop energy. I just hope she can bring back the original Rihanna that wasn't all leather and spikes. I KNOW the next tour will be better!

My goodness, the knowledge obtained from this book was very inspiring and the concept of the four agreements is so simple, although not easy, to apply to your life. Ruiz explains each agreement in depth and makes you look at your life in a totally different light. I was so impressed with this book that i bought 4 copies to give to my best friends. I knew that each would benefit differently from it. They all read inside book cover and was immediately impressed.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|i like the optimism in this film.when the lightning strike the delorean and doc is gone,it was sad and depressing in the end of bttf 2 and marty was all sad and looks like he is stuck all alone in 1955...but then again there is the other doc of 1955 that can help him-all he has to do is explaining this doc all the story and make him help.    and ofcorse,the important sentence and idea of this film and whole the trilogy-that the future isnt written and it is what u make of it. if time travel was a reality we could really write the future and present as we want them,but since its not the case the least we can do is getting control on what we do now in order to build a better future for ourselves-being more assertive to get what we want,then we will achieve the success and we will have a beautiful future.we make our own destiny and not only the circumstances or luck.  plant good seeds now now for a blooming future!:)

B001DTPZNY|4.0|I saw \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" in the theater when I was 10.    That's probably the best disclaimer I can issue regarding my reaction to the worst-titled movie in this series, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\"  Indy has been a part of me for as long as I can remember and no movie hero will ever mean as much to me.  How many tedious days did I sit in fourth grade, gazing wistfully out the window as John Williams' perfect theme music played through my head?  I'd imagine myself battling Nazis and searching for fortune and glory, and life was good.  I'd do the same thing in high school, college, grad school . . . I'm half-amazed I didn't become an archeologist.    And so it is that I cannot be objective about this movie - I simultaneously love it and regret it.  I love it because it's Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford may a bit long in the tooth and a a trifle thicker around the waist, but he's still the perfect action hero.  I see his shadow wearily don his trademark fedora, and I feel 10 years old again.    I'm not entirely sure what happens in this movie - there's something about the Russians, Cate Blanchett, a punk greaser (Shia Lebouef), John Hurt, and the welcome return of Marion.  There are thrilling chases. There are eye-popping visual effects.  There are carnivorous ants - hooray! And there is Indy, swashbuckling through it all.    And yet it is so much less than could possibly be expected - we waited 20 years for this?  If Tolkein came back from the dead and wrote another \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel, it wouldn't be as eagerly anticipated as Indy's return.  While that may be unfair, that's the price you pay for creating a defining character in film history.    If you love Indiana Jones, get this movie.  You will love it and hate it, and you'll probably watch it again and again.
B00026WU7I|5.0|Let me start out by saying, I am only newly 18. And I have definately noticed that my generation has a difficult time appreciating Dylan's work like they should. I'd just like to simply say that he has opened my eyes to a whole other world of music. This album is argueably the best of all time, though I happen to really like all of Dylan's albums, or at least all the ones I've heard.. which is everything from his first self-titled cd to Desire. Plus a few ones following that. But this one in particular really entranced me. By the end of \\"Simple Twist Of Fate\\"(probably one of my favorite tracks off any of his albums) I was hooked. The only reason I really felt the need to submit a review expressing my opinion is because I felt very surprised that I ended up liking Dylan's music as much as I do. He sounds like nothing else I listen to. Hell, I'm seeing Britney Spears in 2 weeks, just to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. And it's for that reason I believe Bob Dylan's work is something really special. I just wish more people my age would just sit down and truely listen, maybe they'd see it too...
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale was awesome in this movie.  He looked like a skeleton but he made the movie very realistic.  I didn't know this movie existed until I saw his biography.  I recommend this movie to anyone whom is a fan.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho (1960) is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films! It is by far his most famous and most memorable film.      Although some of its scariness may have dulled down over the years, it still passes as an effectively creepy movie. What makes Psycho so memorable? First and foremost is the shower scene. For me, the screeching violins and plunging knife are still shocking. One thing I admire about the scene is while it was considered racy (for its time), Hitchcock was able to produce shock without relying on gore or nudity to create the desired effect. It is a concept that many horror directors  today still fail to grasp. Anthony Perkins is iconic as Norman Bates. The film is full of classic lines. Another aspect of the movie's overall creepiness is that it was shot in black and white. It helps create shadowy effects that could not have been produced nearly as well in color. The use of mirrors as symbolism is really cool as well.    I'm reviewing the one-disc collector's edition, so here are the most interesting bonus features: there's a feature-length making-of documentary that includes interviews with Janet Leigh, the screenwriter Joseph Stefano, and Pat Hitchcock. There is also the original theatrical trailer in which Alfred Hitchcock gives us a tour of the Bates Motel set and the Psycho house. A comparison of the shower scene with and without the music is very interesting. Newsreel footage is also included.      A true Hitchcock masterpiece! 5 stars!
B001F12J48|5.0|Tom Hanks was great in this movie.  I'm a big animation fan. He made this movie very realistic.  I especially loved this movie in 3-D.  Worth the money.  Don't forget the 3-D glasses.
0810970686|5.0|My son was so excited to have the latest book in this series!  It is so nice to see him reading and enjoying it!  He is 12 years old... He talked me into reading them also, and I have to say that I laughed a lot!  There are so many things that remind us of our family!  We love Rowley, and my 6 year old loves Manny!    We still haven't figured out what exactly a \\"ploopy\\" is though!
B0009A40ES|5.0|Another great Christian Bale performance.  He was really psycho.  I watched this movie and was impressed with his early acting.  He's an awesome actor.  A must buy for fans.
0195073401|4.0|First off, don't let this be your first introduction to economics. For that, I strongly recommend Mankiw's [[ASIN:0324589972 Principles of Economics]], which involves no math beyond basic algebra. This gigantic book, on the other hand, is used here at the University of Michigan for a full year of micro-theory (including game theory) for first-year PhD students, alongside a crash course in mathematics using Simon & Blume's excellent [[ASIN:0393957330 Mathematics for Economists]]. It's not trying to teach intuition; it's trying to teach concepts that you'll need to understand in order to grasp current work being published in the field's most prestigious journals.<br /><br />The scope of the book is very impressive; it's no wonder that it's become the standard graduate-level text in so many universities. In the context of a course taught by a great professor, it's an excellent supplement. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it for self-study. Definitions are sometimes vague; examples fail to illuminate the turgid concepts being outlined; and there are no solutions to the numerous exercises. (A separate solution manual is available online, but it's often unenlightening.)<br /><br />In short, this book is a boot camp for micro-theorists. It will not hold your hand.<br /><br />But there is little in the way of serious competition. Kreps' [[ASIN:0745007627 A Course in Microeconomic Theory]] is often clearer, as is Rubinstein's [[ASIN:0691120315 Lecture Notes in Microeconomic Theory: The Economic Agent]] (also a free download at his website). Both were recommended by a professor as supplements. Neither of them can possibly hope to cover everything that Mas-Colell et al. cover. There is no perfect micro-theory book. For game theory (which this book spends a few middle chapters on), I'd strongly recommend Binmore's lively (though demanding) [[ASIN:0195300572 Playing for Real]].
B00008H2LE|5.0|as a linkin park fan i like to have the Special Edition/LTD with the extra footage.  It means you know that much more about the band and whats going on.  another nice ltd/blue case cd to add to my collection.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|Indie rock has a tendency to take itself too seriously. Fortunately, Vampire Weekend has managed to resist that urge to produce a smooth, consistent set of fun songs with clever lyrics and catchy melodies.<br /><br />The African influences give Vampire Weekend a distinctive style. Think of this album as a hip successor to Paul Simon's [[ASIN:B0002EQ7E2 Graceland]], an interesting flirtation with afro-pop that's mainly remembered for the whimsical \\"You Can Call Me Al.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed every song on this impressive debut, particularly \\"Oxford Comma,\\" \\"A-Punk,\\"  and \\"I Stand Corrected.\\" For comparison, my other favorite albums include The Arcade Fire's first, [[ASIN:B0002IVN9W Funeral]], and Guster's infectious [[ASIN:B00001SIEW Lost and Gone Forever]].
B000063DFW|5.0|I didn't have an origonal anymore so I decided to buy the special edition.  The 2 disk set is nice, the second cd has a track high voltage which is very diffrent the other versions of high voltage, its amazing.  If you have the cd don't buy the special edition if you don't have the cd buy this album.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|One of the best action movies I've seen in years. Solid performances all-around with a simple, but compelling story.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I agree with a previous comment as to you will either love this film and immerse or you will become disinterested. To those of us who love the film , It is a fantastic fireworks display of visuals.Remarkable images. And when the dust has settled and the film is over, you will, if you are enthralled, think back on it and the linear threads of the story that have been woven and the characters and the stories arc. On the dvd make sure to watch the making of the film.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is an incredible show.  Bryan Cranston is simply awesome as a very smart man who never really tapped into his own potential until he had nothing to lose.  Faced with impending oblivion, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) feels the urgency of time that we should ALL feel, but so rarely do.  Walter is actually a brilliant man who has just not either had the breaks or ambition to climb above the mediocrity that surrounds him - until he is confronted with his own early demise.  As a man who truly loves his family, Walter realizes that he needs to make a lot of money FAST before he dies, so that he won't leave his family destitute.  He then pursues with single-minded determination the only avenue available to a \\"little\\" man with no resources or powerful friends - drug sales.  Realizing that his prowess as a chemist FAR outstrips the abilities of the typical losers who synthesize meth as a living, Walter sets out to become a meth \\"cooker.\\"  However, true to form, he does so honestly, at least in the way that he insists that proper procedures be used to make the best product possible, and then to sell it at a fair price!  The contradiction of an \\"honest\\" meth cooker is incredibly well played by Cranston.  Throw in the other factors that would accompany such an outlandish (and yet, believable) plot, and you get a very compelling story that is accessible to a lot of main-stream America.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|I love this album.  It's elite.  One of the best live albums I've ever heard and I've heard many.  It is easily up there in energy and raw intensity as Springsteen's Live 75 - 85.  This CD was Billy using his personally selected band (after finally gaining commercial success and recognition) to replace the original recordings  that he did with session musicians.  Essentially it is righting a wrong.  This is a fantastic.
B001N26GFC|1.0|I am stunned that so many movie critics - and doubtlessly many viewers - thought very highly of this boring and fairly shallow movie, so much so I am even more worried now about my fellow man. The relatively few critics that disliked this offering of time wasting as much as I tended to give the explanation that the enjoyment or not of the film depends on whether or not you like the continuously bubbly main character Poppy. I found her constant witless, even clownish cheerfulness on top of a dull script to be a constant irritant and not even credible. Not that she was not an attractive, good-hearted person, it's that her pointless bubbly behavior being constant just gets tiresome. It doesn't have the charm and purpose of say, the ever high spirits of Amelie in that charming film of the same name. But even assuming that this ever cheerful giggle clown could be lovable to someone I don't see how that could compensate for the film's mostly dull and shallow script.     The first few scenes were not just humorless, they were painfully bad and after waiting in pain for nearly an hour to see some redeeming change I had to turn it off. I was supposed to love this character? If I had been her driving instructor in the film I would have dumped this childish, irresponsible, inattentive clown after lesson 2. What is wrong with these film critics?!
B00000889Y|5.0|The Cramps are always a good time.. You will not be disappointed.  Lux and Ivy always put on an amazing show and this disk captures that energy.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|This is just a pure entertaining movie!  No deep thoughts, no social, injustice, just fun and simple entertainment!    You have a very attractive actress a very good looking actor, lots of action, and lots of sexual \\"simmer\\".  Watch the movie just to be entertained,  you will like it.
B000002GGU|4.0|It was the summer of '84. if you had your radio on, chances were that one of the 10 songs on this album was playing. Bryan Adams hit mega-commercial paydirt when \\"Reckless\\" dropped six hit singles and 2 major album tracks, eventually selling over 7 million copies. It's also a watershed peak of songwriting for Adams and his partner Jim Vallance.<br /><br />If you need a primer is what constituted a hit 80's rock album, \\"Reckless\\" (and to a lesser extent, Adam's prior album [[ASIN:B000026GZE Cuts Like a Knife]]) offer it up. Tightly constructed songs with huge hooks, like \\"Summer Of 69\\" or \\"Heaven.\\" Put in a duet with it-rock comeback queen Tina Turner, \\"It's Only Love.\\" Add an encore-ready stadium shouter, \\"Kids Wanna Rock.\\" And make sure that two pop-rockers have sufficient polish to sound safe but urgent on the top-forty radio, the brilliant \\"Run To You\\" and catchy \\"Somebody.\\"<br /><br />Adams hit all the marks on \\"Reckless,\\" but he has done few songs to match \\"Summer of 69.\\" A perfect slice of Springsteen (who was also then massively popular with [[ASIN:B0000025UW Born in the U.S.A.]]) growin' up rock, it's one of those records that both marks a moment and defines it. Also very close to that level of perfection was \\"Heaven,\\" a love ballad that Adams would eventually nail with \\"Everything I Do\\" and \\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman.\\" But it is the fact that \\"Reckless\\" works as a whole album that makes this Adam's most memorable work. Between this and his many greatest hits collections, there's not many other ways to get such a dead-on overview of Bryan Adam's world of rock.

B000002A73|5.0|When the question comes up,and it does frequently,who is the true leader of the floyd success story,it is a difficult question to answer.<br />The Roger fans swear by his genius,the gilmour fans will do the same.<br />It is my belief that this album answers this question honestly.Roger is at his absolute best.His lyrical content ,as well as his compositional awareness is in fifth gear and rolling.<br />Rogers genius shines through and glitters as gold as the cd he released.It is his crowning achievement in his already illustrious career.<br />The concept is in tact,its song strings tell a story that is near to his heart.He empathizes with the tragedies of latter modern tragedies,as well as questions authority,with a slice of personal philosophical belief.<br />The music is flawless,and takes you on a journey that makes one think.<br />If ever there was an addition to a collection,this one is it.
031236198X|3.0|Our Iceberg is Melting by John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber<br /><br />Edit<br /><br />Yet another work read and this one sticks in my mind. Probably as much for the entertainment value as the educational one. How to identify and work with those resistant to change (for whatever reason) without letting them, yourself, or your work get sidetracked.
1439102813|5.0|This book was recommended as I am facing a possible family member being diagnosed with some level of dementia.  I found this book extremely helpful.  Not only did it present an excellent storyline but it was humorous at the same time of being sad.  I applaud the author and look forward to her next endeavors.
B0017PCX20|5.0|If you, like me, have just discovered this band...  get ALL of their albums.  This is such a fine band.  I have every one now.  I'm just waiting for MORE!!!!!
0345495004|5.0|the use of fact as a foundation for fiction is perfect and the story is wonderful. i loved reading this story and don't want to give away the ending - I cried. the way they loved each other perfectly described a love affair.
0307277887|5.0|I had watched the first season of Dexter on DVD and was talking about it at work with one of the kids (I work at a juvenile detention center) and he mentioned that he had read and enjoyed the book.  On his advice (and my love for the show), I picked it up.  At first I thought it was going to be the first season exactly, but in written form, but as I continued reading I was pleasanty suprised.  While some of the book mirrored the first season of the show, a lot of it was quite different.  It was a strange read in the begining, with Lindsay's use of alliteration and metaphors, but I got used to it and the book read a lot like Dexter's own thoughts and narations in the show. I found Dexter's character well developed and easy to get into.  It was well written, like you almost felt Dexter's emotions...if he had any.  I would recomend this book to anyone who likes the tv series.  I also purchaced the second and third books and can't wait to read them, even though I heard that Dexter in the Dark was terrible.
0307276902|5.0|I never read a book besides being made to in school...i heard about this book from a friend and i had to read it....it is now my alllll time favorite book i would reccomend it to anyone..Then you must follow up with MY friend leonard. Not as good as Million little pieces but it follows up with James's life after the book ends  Enjoy :]
B000F5GNX8|4.0|I enjoyed this film because it is not too formulaic, quite funny at times and has a poignant story line. Robert Downey is pretty convincing as a ne'er do well transplant from New York but the real treat is Val Kilmer who plays a gay private eye/movie consultant deftly and never goes over the top with his performance. He and Robert Downey Jr. have good on-screen chemistry and this coupled with some sardonic dialogue makes for a few good laughs. Michelle Monaghan plays well as a striking Midwest girl in search of the Hollywood lights who is also Downey Jr.'s first love and therein lies a sweet and romantic story element. I will not say too much for fear of spoiling the story but I do recommend this film because it is fresh, has a lot of heart and strength in its nuances.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I've read about how this record is a \\"total reinvention\\" of the band, a \\"big departure from their old sound.\\"  Sure, they mix it up a bit on this one, but it's still the same Keane I loved from the moment I heard \\"Somewhere Only We Know.\\"  Reinvent?  Not really.  Reinvigorate?  Definitely!  There are still the sweeping melodies, bittersweet, heartfelt lyrics, immediate hooks and that flare for British drama that Queen began in the 1970s.  One noticeable addition to the Keane playbook is a new-found sense of playfulness that may be just a tad overdue for the band.  There's also a definite 1980s nostalgia going on here, with sentimental analog synths and old-school drum machines here and there.  But come on - what alternative / indie band these days hasn't dabbled in that new-wave revival stuff?  I think it's quite becoming for Keane's sound, and gives the album a retro-yet-current flare.  Longtime fans should find plenty here to enjoy:  \\"You Don't See Me\\" and the title track are among several tracks that are classic Keane - piano-based, romantic ballads.  I will say, however, that there is little of the experimentation found on the latter half of Hopes & Fears and sprinkled throughout Under The Iron Sea.  Frankly, I think this makes the album lean and cohesive.  It's not only an easy listen from beginning to finish--it's a thrilling and addictive one.  These tight hooks will get stuck in your head and the softer moments will draw you in deeper.  In sum, Keane lightened up a bit and had some fun without losing their identity.  I've loved these guys since day one and I couldn't be more satisfied with Perfect Symmetry.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|No really, I think it is.  Even its relative shortness is a virtue:  it says what it needs to say and doesn't overcome its welcome.  Joss Whedon's witty prose are strong in this one, and be prepared to laugh yourself silly to many a memorable quote.  I heartily recommend this to anyone who has felt like destroying society.  :D
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This is an excellent production and recording.  I purchased it after seeing the live performance of the same production with an also excellent but different cast.  The staging is spare but evocative and effective, and the performances, especially by Renee Fleming are truly memorable.  One of the best opera DVD's I've seen.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|If you like reading about profoundly dysfunctional families, this is a book for you. A mother who is a total monster and destroys all three of her children. This woman is so horrible, it makes your hair stand on end. A father who is so weak that he just stands by while his wife tortures his children. A very powerful reading. The only complaint I have about the book is that it offers no hope whatsoever. The message of the novel seems to be that abused children have no recourse against horrible mothers. I admire Picoult's honesty in dealing with such sensitive topic, but it is hard to read 400 pages showing a mother who mutilates her children physically and emotionally. I wish there were some hope offered in the book.<br />[...]
B000KN7BOA|5.0|This album wasn't really the Bee Gees' First - two albums with the three Gibb brothers had been previously released in Australia. \\"The Bee Gees 1st\\" was their first internationally released album, and the first to come out after their return to Britain.<br /><br />Musically it's one of their most succesfull early albums. There is a great basic approach that ofter was lost on their following albums, where the ballads often suffered from heavy orchestration.<br /><br />Moreover the songwriting on this album is consistently of high standards. Three of their finest singles \\"New York Mining Disaster\\", \\"Holiday\\" and \\"To Love Somebody\\" is featured here along with other great tracks like \\"Red Chair Fade Away\\", \\"I Can't See Nobody\\" and \\"Cucumber Castle\\".<br /><br />In fact, there are no throwaways on the albums, and the Bee Gees really do sound like a band on this album.<br /><br />On this new digitally remastered version the sound is crystal-clear, and it a great pleasure to listen to these old songs again. The second CD features alternate versions of many of the songs, and several are at least as good as the originally released versions. I especially like \\"One Minute Woman\\" - which has only the basic band instrumentation.<br /><br />A couple of the previously unreleased songs are quite good too - \\"Gilbert Street\\" and \\"I've Gotta Learn\\" are two.<br /><br />Great release.
B001NFNFIK|2.0|Why do filmmakers destroy a great book? A terrible movie, great acting but a crap movie. Poorly edited, choppy, no atmosphere, NO CLETE, harly a ghost, charecter development was sadly lacking. Was Bootsie there? Or Batiste? Not nearly as much as in the books. Read the book, forget the movie. I feel real bad for what they did to your fine book Mr.Burke.  a shame.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This movie was very good. I didn't know much about it before I watch it. The story is suppose to be based on a true story and it left me sick to my stomach that such horror can happen to anyone. They do not show directly the graphic murders but show enough to let you know exactly what happened. After watching the movie I was disturbed for a few days and I had to work at not thinking about it. I think I would have rather not seen it; however it was filmed very well and the acting etc was excellent.
B00140GXQU|5.0|\\"Still Life\\" is a Masterpice, but it's not for beginners.   One could easily get \\"lost\\" in the multi-layered soundscapes and organ driven experimental eccentricity of this Van Der Graaf Record.   If you have been feeding yourself with Yes, ELP, Genesis, Camel or Floyd don't go near this one, you must first learn about Soft Machine, Gong, Magma and pehaps a little bit of jazz(from 1967 to 1977) and a little bit of Joni Mitchell.   Peter Hammill is a genious and Van Der Graaf is one of the best bands to come from UK in the 60's/70's.They Still make marvelous music.   The thing is that this is one of those bands that you will either love and - from the first organ sound or vocal whisper - feel you finally found your home or you will hate it and perceive them as a low-fi chaotic mixture of post-rock avant-guarde piece crap.   Normally i would say music has no barriers and it's made for everyone but in this case i can't say that.This is not for average prog rock listener.   If you are in the process of discovering the world of VdGG and PH music i strongly recommend that you start off your mystical journey with \\"The Quiet Zone/Pleasure Dome\\" or \\"World Record\\" then work your way to \\"Godbluf\\" and \\"Pawn Hearts\\".After those you're ready for everything else, including \\"Still Life\\"!   As For Peter Hammill solo efforts i recommend \\"Chameleon in the Shadow of the night\\", it's a warmish mellow gem of an album.Folky tunes with a deep countryside feel to it.     Still life is my favorite VdGG album, i grew up listening to this songs and was my first VdGG record.I had already found out about the band and a good friend of mine gave me a Mixtape K-7(good days) with stuff from \\"Godbluff\\"/\\"Pawn Hearts\\"/\\"Fool's Mate\\"/\\"Still Life\\" i got instantly hooked on VdGG!I raised some money to buy one of their cds(at the time cd imports were very expensive), i wanted \\"GodBluff\\" but the record store only had \\"Pawn Hearts\\" and \\"Still Life\\", since i already loved both i chose Still life.   I love PH vocals on this one, very intense and emotional, the lyrics are astonishing and the organs are well crafted.As mentioned in other Reviews the mood here is Laid-back mellow.   Never dull, every song is it's own island, still, the songs comunicate very well with each other.   Highlights are: \\"La Rossa\\", \\"Still Life\\" and \\"Childlike faith in Chilhood's end\\".   Its a good album to lay down on your sofa or bed, turn off the lights and let yourself float into the delightfull sounds of VdGG.     For all who love this band is a Must!
B000025H0Q|4.0|Steeper, breezier arrangements on BL compliments his other bare-bones melancholia, rarely smothering the elemental sadness and acoustic excellence prevalent in near everything Drake composed.
0743486285|1.0|I had such high expectations after hearing all the positive reviews but the book got really boring, fast.  Same entries over and over - drugs suck, i wish I was dead, etc.  When Sixx does write about some sexual conquest or a tale of debauchery from the road, it wasn't that interesting.  I basically read those same stories years ago in Hit Parader.  And that only cost me two bucks.
B000066HI4|4.0|Often regarded as his greatest, and can that be blamed? For that rare album, BPB tunes all his minimal elements of alt-country despair deeper, and  paired with his fleeting ability here to curb excessive posturing, simply is beautiful in his most selflessly intelligent, and varied way to date.  Quite frankly, being as how this was the disc that broke him, it is sad how much more accidentally innovative and mistakenly magical this seems in retrospect when being suckered into damn near his entire catalog, hoping to find a fraction of the \\"mistakes\\" as are on here. I should have just stuck with this.
B001QB9H10|1.0|This movie was horrible. The relationship between the Transporter and the girl was so lame that it's hard to imagine a professional writer was on the payroll. The lack of overall effort for story imagination and credibility suggests a clear case of producer greed. I believe they just shot themselves in the foot with this installment, because anyone who liked the previous two films will gag and choke so horribly on this one, that their trust forever abandon them.
B0000033TE|4.0|It's always nice to go back to these dark horses of progressive in their heyday, displaying compositional flair at its most excessive BUT having the compositional chops to back it up (seems like most neo-prog tends to follow the first rule more). BSS flows great, independently and as a whole, balancing out skill with grace, ambition with humor, and epic with minor to legendary success.
0739368044|3.0|The book was good but after waiting for it to come out for 3 or 4 years since the \\"Eldest\\" with the hope that the so called \\"Inheritance Trilogy\\" would come to a close we find that there is yet a 4th book to come which will probably be another 3 or 4 years.  This reminds me of the Terry Googdkind \\"Sword of Truth\\" series which would not come to a close. I finally gave up on Goodkind and his \\"Sword of Truth\\" series and will never buy another one of his books.  If Paolini follows in the steps of Goodkind, the next book in the Trilogy or should I say Quadrology will be the last of his books I ever purchase.
0440178002|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. I was sad when I finished and could not pick up another book for 2 months. I had to let this one soak in and didn't want any new story to infringe. This is actually based loosely off of a true story of an Englishman who becomes friend to last true Shogun of Japan. Wiki the book. Just an amazing, amazing work. You could almost mistake the adventure as being your own.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|I loved this book on so many levels.  It is a great story, a remarkable look into pieces of India not often discussed, and caustically hilarious.  A must read.
1400063515|5.0|This is the most fascinating book that I have read up to date.<br />It is indeed not without its flaws, and Taleb is impudent and very opinionated.<br /><br />Nevertheless, he is a brilliant writer and thinker who manages to capture the imagination and prompt the reader to think throughout the better half of 300 pages -- it is one of those books where you can't read 5 pages without stopping and marvelling at the profound implications of what you have read. (Note that this is from the perspective of a lay reader.)<br /><br />I read some Amazon reviews after completing the book, and despite the fact that I'm now privy to some of the criticisms from those in the know, I'm still awarding the book 5 stars based on the distinctive overarching theme, style and content that I relished.<br /><br />My favourite parts (in order of appearance):<br />1. \\"Living in the Antechamber of Hope\\"<br /><br />2. \\"Apelles the Painter, or What Do You Do if You Cannot Predict?\\"<br />His \\"modest tricks\\" are brilliant in my opinion (and deceptively simple).<br />a.)

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I LOVED THIS MICHAEL MOORE documentary. I know a lot of people talk crap about him but believe me. A lot of what he said is really true. I have friends in Canada and in Cuba and it's really like that. Tyra Banks even commented not in this film but on her show, when she lived in Paris she use to pay 40.00 for a doctor to come see her in her apartment. Way different from the states. Universal health care not sure if it will ever be reality here in the states but I sure hope we the people can make that change. I am a self pay patient with no insurance and just to get a dermatologist consultation 200.00
0307387178|4.0|This is an early work by Mr. Krakauer. I found the writing more uneven than his personal memoir, \\"Into Thin Air,\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed.        Mr. Krakauer attempted (but ultimately failed, in my opinion) to get into the head of Mr. McCandless as he tried to answer the question every reader of the book would ask - \\"Why did McCandless do that?\\" Unfortunatley, the source material was too thin to adequately answer this question - two pages of Mr. McCandless's terse journal entries over a couple of years, interviews with people who knew him for hours to days to weeks during his wanderings, and pithy statements from family about his life growing up.        As a result, the work lacks the immediacy and intimacy of \\"Into Thin Air.\\"        To fill this void, Mr. Krakauer stated at the beginning of this book that he was not an objective biographer of a man whose actions and death left many people scratching their heads in bewilderment. Rather, he saw his life and decisions reflected in the choices that Mr. McCandless (and others, whom he presented in short asides) made. I realize that every biographer injects some of themselves into the stories of the people they tell, but Mr. Krakauer's approach was a bit heavy handed for me.        Though interesting, I did not read this book to find out why some people decide to walk into the wilderness, nor why Mr. Krakauer nearly did so. I read this book to find out why Mr. McCandless did. A question that cannot be answered does not make a compelling book unless the fact that it is unanswerable is itself compelling, which it was not.         As a result, I found this book to be an interesting read, and deservig of four stars, but I would recommend \\"Into Thin Air\\" as a better book.
B000HEVALC|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing an amazing musical based on this real-life Jam session in Chicago. The musical was fantasic, but somehow I had trouble believing that Johny Cash, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis actually hung out one Christmas and played music together in the little studio (once an autoparts store/ garage) where they got there start.  Picture yourself and 3 friends enjoying some Holiday cheer and deciding to take out a few instraments and sing.  Now imagine that you just happen to be Elvis and your friends are the forefathers of rock and roll.   That's pretty much what this is about.  And it's not just their well know hits that you're eavesdropping on, but rather a lot of music from their roots. Gospel - church music and of course rock-a -billy.  Unpretentious, pre-mega stardom, talent in its early days.    The sound quality is amazingly good considering that the session was secretly recorded back in the 50's.    Worth every penny.

B000P0J09C|5.0|So you thought you have seen the best War movies with \\"Apocalypse Now\\", \\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\", \\"Three Kings\\" and \\"Courage Under Fire\\" and the others ? Well think again soldier! Because this movie will blow the pajamas off your yellow behind. This is a realistic depiction. This is a life of a man turned into a killing machine. This is a true-cold-blood War movie.    The story based on the novel \\"The Short-Timers\\" by Gustav Hasford follows a bunch of new recruits from their training in the Marine Corps into the assignment at Vietnam, into the War-zone and into the dead face of the VietCongs. From the opening scene itself you see the actors and their fate in their eyes. The first 40 minutes is sheer brilliant delight; you can't miss a word of dialogue and you can't take your eyes off the regimental training.    From a man to a Marine. R. Lee Ermey who was a Marine trainer was hired on set as a consultant to make accurate depiction of Marine Corps training. His mean brilliance led to Kubrick casting him in the movie as the drill sergeant - he played on film what he did before retirement to real recruits of the Army. From a man to a killing machine.    The movie moves next as the recruits are assigned to the battle-zone. Actor Matthew Modine ends up as a journalist for \\"Stars and Stripes\\", the official military newspaper.    And then the Tet Offensive starts in Vietnam. Under fire, on duty in the field, Modine's character \\"James Joker\\" is asked to join in with a rifle.    \\"This is my rifle this is my gun...this is for fighting this is for fun\\" sang the boys holding their rifle and crotch in each hand during their training run.    The drill sergeant has taught them well. They need to remember what they learnt because otherwise \\"...you would be a dead Marine; and a Marine cannot die without permission\\".    Awesome, mindblowing stuff!    The soldier Leonard (also played by a first time actor who worked as a bouncer and gained 80 pounds weight forthe role of a fat idiot) steals the show along with the sergeant Hartman in the first half of course.    The last half belongs to James Joker and Animal Mother (actor Adam Baldwin). The last 40 minutes is equally as engaging and spellbinding as the first.    You would think that this accuracy would mean it was shot on location in some South East Asian country. No, Stanley Kubrick did not like to be farther than 10 miles from his home. So the movie was shot in East London in a old location which was being torn down for rebuilding. So the broken buildings are real and they were being blown up gladly by the cast and crew of \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" at no objection. Modine is brilliant explaining why he wears a peace button on his uniform while his helmet has \\"Born to Kill\\" written on it. \\"...duality of man\\" he explains before he joins the ranks of combat Marines. Kubrick showcased not just another movie on Vietnam War. No, what he did was to show how an ordinary American man is turned into a crazed killer for waging War.    Watch this and learn the horrors of War.    Weirdly after watching this movie I have a strange compulsive urge to enlist myself in the US Marine Corps.    Sadly all of Hasford's books are OUT OF PRINT !  Sign the petition to bring them back at [...]

B00006I53S|4.0|This lens is worth the money, or buying as a kit option.  I would give it 5 stars, but there are couple of minor issues that bring it down.      Pros: USM. Quick focus. Great images.  Pretty good range between wide field and moderate zoom at a great price point.  My favorite single travel lens if I don't feel like switching lens all day long or carrying multiples.    Cons:  LENS CREEP.  After a while it happens to a lot of these.  There are ways to fix it if you are knowledgeable.  Dust gets in pretty easy but not enough to degrade your images or even notice.    Overall, I think it is the best single carry lens on the market.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I purchased Planet Earth as a gift.  I was happy at how fast I got here.  My father loved it.  The seller did an excellent job.      However, I was unhappy with Amazon itself. There was some type of error or mix up with my account and my sister's.  I purchased this dvd under my email account and my credit card, but some how my sister was charged for it as well (as was I).  We do not share any information, not even a home address. When I called Amazon they said I couldn't do anything because there wasn't any mix-up with my order.  When my sister called, they told her to just return the item to the seller.  They didn't even apologize or try to figure out what the problem was.  I'm afraid to buy from Amazon again because I don't want the mix-up to happen again or for my sister to get charged for something I purchase.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Be forewarned, you will need to give your undivided attention to really enjoy this movie. It has so much going for it that a good portion is lost in its initial viewing. That said, this is one movie that has stood the test of time. I have watched it at least 6 times now. Watched it twice when it came out on DVD and then every other year when I needed a guaranteed cinematic experience. It hasn't lost its luster after all these years. Naomi Watts delivers such a convincing performance in the audition scene that, to this day, deserves an Oscar or some similar form of recognition.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Having only caught the odd episode of Desperate Housewives when it aired on Channel 4, I remember enjoying it and decided to buy the first series on DVD - and its even better then I remembered.<br /><br />The four desperate housewives are the main protagonists in the series. Bree, who on the outside seems to be the perfect housewife with the perfect family, while actually her marriage is in trouble and her kids are rebelling against her. Gabby, the ex-model who married for money, not for love and has to resort to sleeping with her 17 year old gardener to find happiness. Susan, a single mother who gets along very well with her daughter but is constantly plagued by troubles with men as she tries to find love. And Lynette, the only happily married housewife, who has to deal with 4 troublesome sons.<br /><br />Right from the very first scene of the first episode, the mystery and drama starts and it doesnt stop untill the end. I found the series very compulsive viewing and often ended up watching 3 or 4 episodes in a row because I just HAD 2 find out what happened next.<br /><br />The show has mystery (a lot of it), drama, romance and is very funny in places, too.<br /><br />An excellent series which I would deffinatly reccommened.
B001CRRAE4|5.0|This movie features not only the most impressive gunfight sequences in recent movie history but also some very stylish swordfighting scenes. An outstanding performance by Christian Bale (American Psycho, Reign of Fire) made it all the more enjoyable. His convincing portrayal of the highest ranking Grammaton Cleric, a near superhuman killing machine, draws you into the post-apocalyptic world of Libria very quickly. Initially, the set designs took me aback; it wasn't as polished as the costume designs but that's quite understandable given the movie's budget. It's definitely no Minority Report nor The Matrix in terms of production quality but it succeeds in bringing its own memorable flavor. Despite the premise and some pretty weak moments along the way, I found myself being entertained by this little gem of a sci-fi action flick.
B000RIWAVW|4.0|A good, suspenceful movie that spawned one of the most popular and long lived slasher series ever.<br /><br />When he was only six years old, Micheal Myers killed his sister with a large butcher knife. He spent the next fifteen years in a mental institution, where his therapist spent eight years trying to cure him before realiseing that he was \\"pure evil\\" and spent the next seven years making sure that he stayed locked away for life. But on October 31st 1978, Micheal Myers escaped, hellbent on a murder spree, climaxing in the one-by-one murders of Lorrie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends.<br /><br />Althought it is not very violent (and not bloody at all) and the death scenes are quite tame by todays standards, Halloween is still a scary movie (made even creepier by the chilling musical score) and one of the first in the slasher genre. Deffinatly worth a watch, the start of a great series.
6305327084|4.0|I saw this movie back in the 90s and didnt think much of it. A few gray hairs and a decade later, I have nothing but good things to say about the movie. It has substance and a valuable message to men in their late 20s or early 30s. As an added bonus, Natalie Portman is such a joy to watch. The dialogue between her and Timothy Hutton is so endearing and sincere that it almost felt like they're star-crossed lovers.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Many people think that Halloween was the first slasher movie, but Black Christmas was made four years earlier and is the first proper slasher movie that was made. There were a few gore movies in the sixties which featured death scenes throughout and of course \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Twitch of the Death Nerve\\" was made in 1972, but none of these movies properly followed the slasher movie forumla untill Black Christmas. So I think that this movie deserves credit for being (arguably) the first one of its kind out there.<br /><br />A bunch of girls (aged somewhere between 18 and 22) in a college sorority house receive series of prank phone calls, which arent so much threatening as disturbing and then start getting killed off. These phone calls are the scariest part of the movie, in my opinion, the are REALLY creepy and disturbing. The movie relies on suspence and its creepiness rather than violence and the deaths (of which there are only a few) have almost no gore. Another element which adds to the suspence of the movie is that we know from very early on in the movie that the killer was in the house with the girls so one of them could be killed at any time.<br /><br />The Good things about the movie are that the phone calls are genuinely creepy and there is quite a lot of suspence throughout, and it was the first movie of its kind.<br /><br />The Bad things are that therent arent many death scenes or much gore in the movie and also, even before the girls start to dissappear, all of the charactors seem to be clinically depressed, in a few scenes the main protagonist, Jess, looks as though she may burst into tears (although to be fair we later find out that she is planning on having an abortion) which made me feel sorry for them. The end is rather confusing too - it might just be me thing thick but after finishing the movie Im still not really sure who the killer was.<br /><br />Overall quite a good slasher which I would reccomend viewing because of its at-the-time origionality and because its very creepy and suspenceful. Deffinately worth a watch.suspenceful. Deffinately worth a watch.
1400023343|3.0|The author has done so much research, yet refuses to make objective observations. Failed attempts have nearly no representation, so the later 2/3rds of the book is simply a collection of we-tried-this-and-it-was-so-so stories. You could choose to follow the example of a case study in the book and never know it fails for three out of four kids.    I have plenty of adult friends who failed to become fluent let alone native-level bilinguals despite their general academic strength and their parents efforts, so it's not a trivial issue.    I'll be looking for another book on the topic.
B00005KAQP|5.0|LOVE Sister Act, a brilliant movie. Clever and funny and so good at chearing you up when you are down! You cannot watch this movie and not smile! Brilliant!<br /><br />Vegas singer Delores (Whoopi Goldberg) walks in on her boyfriend shooting a man and subsequently must be placed in the witness protection programme. She is put in the last place anybody would ever look for her...a nunery!

One of my favourite movies. Very highly reccomended.
0316017922|3.0|Much in the book to like. Makes you think about success in a different light. Emphasizes the virtue of hard work, while acknowledging the role that luck and opportunities play. However much to argue against also. Some arguments are not carried over to any logical conclusion. Some premises are just not backed by research worth mentioning. Too light on reasoning and too heavy on anecdotes in places. Starts off strong but tapers off midway. The premise and promise of the book is not matched by the content. Like peanut butter spread too thin on a sandwich. Like eating daal (lentils) with too much gravy and too little daal.<br /><br />This book describes the secrets, so to say, of outliers, i.e. people who are far removed from the average, focusing on those who are far above the average, not those far below. The secrets, as it turns out, are mundane, nor involve disclosure of any top secret rites of passage or initiation into cults, but much that is quotidian. Like hard work. Over several years. Like opportunities. Like being in the right place at the right time, or being born in the right place at the right time. Like having rich parents. And so on.<br /><br />Why three out of five stars? After all, there is a lot that is going for the book. The writing is very engaging, the topic is very important, the anecdotes grab your attention, the style keeps the reader going, and the length is short.<br /><br />Well - firstly, the book is short. Too short to be really effective. For such a topic. It is like a Reader's Digest condensed version, except it does not really feel condensed.<br /><br />Two, no topic is covered in any sort of depth. Feels shallow. There are so many aspects in every topic covered that are left unsaid, uncovered. Like how the brain develops, how different cognitive abilities are affected by what we do, how we live. What role does family play - in providing psychological support. Or how multi-lingualism affects ability. And so on...<br /><br />Three, the anecdotes are entertaining and illuminating at first. But towards the middle and thereafter they become too detailed and too numerous, to the point of suffocating the narrative, and drowning the author's message out.<br /><br />Four, what Gladwell posits when attempting to use cultural dimensions to explain mathematical skills and aptitude is just lame.<br /><br />This book is good, but could have been a lot better.<br /><br />=========================================<br />*** \\"People don't rise from nothing.

1603580557|5.0|In \\"Thinking in Systems,\\" Donella H. Meadows helps us understand that not only do we live in a dynamic world of systems, we can impact that world in positive ways by understanding better how simple systems work and how those systems feed into larger and larger systems.<br /><br />I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to understand this book, but I happily found that not to be the case. The author offers concrete diagrams and real-world examples throughout, with \\"interludes\\" and bits of poetry thrown in for spice and to lock in the thinking. It is easy to read. I was able to make the mental leap from how a car dealer's decisions about inventory could cause wild oscillations that are hard to control to the roller coaster stock market that we're witnessing now. I am less frightened for having read this book.<br /><br />Meadows gave me hope that our systems can be stabilized--the wild gyrations tamed--if we and our leaders will shift to more systemic thinking. (President Obama shows signs that he is already thinking systemically.) While made up of simple components, systems are not simple and can behave in very weird but predictable ways IF we do not ignore or obscure the information a system needs to function.<br /><br />Although the initial draft of this book was completed in 1993, the insights conveyed seem very current and fresh. For example, in speaking of one system, the author presciently states: \\"The people in this system are putting up with deleterious behavior because they are afraid of change. They don't trust that a better system is possible. They feel they have no power to demand or bring about improvement.\\" She goes on to encourage us to ask why people are \\"so easily convinced of their powerlessness...more likely to listen to people who tell them they can't make changes than they are to people who tell them they can?\\" She could be talking about the U.S. in the last few years and the political machinations still going on.<br /><br />The book is chock-full of wisdom. Although most of the book deals with helping us understand and think about systems, the final chapter offers wonderful guidance, organized under the following headings, about what each of us can do to improve the behavior of systems large and small:<br /><br />Get the Beat of the System<br />Expose Your Mental Models to the Light of Day<br />Honor, Respect, and Distribute Information<br />Use Language with Care and Enrich It with Systems Concepts<br />Pay Attention to What Is Important, Not Just What Is Quantifiable<br />Make Feedback Policies for Feedback Systems<br />Go for the Good of the Whole<br />Listen to the Wisdom of the System<br />Locate Responsibility in the System<br />Stay Humble--Stay a Learner<br />Celebrate Complexity<br />Expand Time Horizons<br />Defy the Disciplines<br />Expand the Boundary of Caring<br />Don't Erode the Goal of Goodness<br /><br />The function of all of these was to cause me to take a deep breath, let it all out, and RELAX.<br /><br />Meadows offers an eleventh commandment that we all would benefit from taking to heart: \\"Thou shalt not distort, delay, or withhold information\\" because, she says, \\"You can drive a system crazy by muddying its information streams. You can make a system work better with surprising ease if you can give it more timely, more accurate, more complete information.\\" I think our economy would improve and things would get better for everyone if we'd all stop allowing ourselves to be worked up into such frenzies by this breathless cable news program or that incendiary talk show host. Before we forward that distressing email, maybe we should verify that it's true so we don't muddy the information stream.

You can make a system work better with surprising ease if you can give it more timely, more accurate, more complete information.\\" I think our economy would improve and things would get better for everyone if we'd all stop allowing ourselves to be worked up into such frenzies by this breathless cable news program or that incendiary talk show host.

B000B7HZXM|4.0|There are singers out there that you just happen to like.  They can dabble in this genre then that, and--being who they are--you follow along cheerfully and cut them all the slack they could possibly need.  You may not nearly be so generous towards artists you're NOT a fan of, but your fave raves are like your kids. They can do no wrong.    Well, in Rod Stewart's case, that's not entirely true.  I've been following his career since he debuted with the Jeff Beck group in the late '60s.  His raspy voice was probably a love it/hate it kind of thing even then, and I was basically in the former camp.  As far as holding his own against a stellar guitarist, I thought he did even better than Robert Plant (who emerged just about the same time).   The solo projects were just as distinctive, and the simultaneous Faces releases didn't do any damage to his emerging reputation either.  But there WERE those disco years.  The late '70s output served as proof for me that I really couldn't listen to Rod the Mod sing ANY old genre.  I really wouldn't care to hear him sing the phone book--or disco either, for that matter.    But if the phone book is out, well, who can complain about the \\"American Songbook?  Well, apparently a lot of people could and did, but I wasn't among them.  Yes, four albums worth looked like he was milking a formula, but the thing is all those great old tunes were designed for distinctive singers--and Rod Stewart is certainly that.  So milk away, I say.  For the most part, it works.  The world probably doesn't need another version of \\"Makin' Whoopee\\" (even with Sir Elton John on board to share the vocal honors--and, say?, is there some kinda subtext there?),  but they seem to be having a good time, and it's solid enough to make you forget the umpteen other versions of same for a few minutes.  And sneakin' in Sam Cooke's \\"You Send Me\\" (ably co-sung by Chaka Khan) is a good reminder that for those of us of a certain age, \\"The Great American Songbook\\" has a somewhatmore expansive definition that it might have for preceding generations.  And his \\"Thanks For the Memories\\" is at least as good aa Bob Hope's.  So,yeah, it's formula, but it's a very workable one. Plus allows for some variation.  I'm never going to play all of his GASB CDs back to back, but they have their place.      Like his producer, Steve Tyrell, does on his on solo records, Stewart brings a little grit to these old sawhorses.  It's a nice touch.  A smart career move, as others have suggested?  Of course, although his most recent release suggests, Rod's not completely done rockin' yet.  Bottom line for me: if it ain't disco OR the phone book, I'll check it out.
6302765536|4.0|I was pleased to find this item. It arrived in great shape and in a timely manner.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|I'm all for experimenting. As a matter of fact some experimental albums have been awesome in the past (OK Computer, anyone?), but that was still rock. Then radiohead came up with Kid A and Amnesiac... and went kinda down the drain until they came up with Hail to the Thief and In Rainbows, on top of their game again.     Same thing applies to Chris Cornell. The fan makes an artist famous.    What would happen if Britney Spears comes up with a hard rock or progressive rock album? A few idiots will praise it as an astute move.     Stick to your roots and to who you are, but always remember, you are who you are (million-records-seller , multiple-mag-covers ) because of the fans.     Experiment but do not alienate.     Sure there are some catchy and a few good songs in the album, but surprisingly the very, very best song on the album is that hidden bluesy tune with full vocal power by one of (if not the) best voices of our generations.     You don't have to go back to Badmotorfinger... just don't go Kanye on us!

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|One of Stanley Kubrick's best movies; also one of Ryan O'Neal's best.  Period details are exquisite and lush, on par with Merchant & Ivory films. It helps to be familiar with English history to be truly comfortable with the long, slow story, the point of the narration, and the complex layers of society with the story set in 1844; however, one doesn't need to be a history buff to appreciate all the technical merits of this extraordinary film.  This film will definitely transport the viewer to a different time in space...Kubrick's specialty.
0439023483|2.0|The best thing I can really say for this book is that it had great potential.     It's about a totalitarian society that, to remind its people who's in charge, holds the annual Hunger Games, where twenty-four kids ages 12 to 18 are locked in an enormous arena to fight to the death.    It had a lot of promise in the beginning. What would kids do when faced with a choice between murdering a friend and being murdered themselves? What damage does it inflict on the children's psyches? Is this year's game going to be different somehow?    The writing isn't great--there are some awkward sentences and some grammatical errors, and the use of present tense narration is unique but distracting and doesn't add anything of value. There are some significant unrealistic plot devices that Collins uses to fuel the adventure. On the other hand, the story really has potential.    But in the end, there is no resolution. Or if there is, it's maddeningly unsatisfying.     *Spoilers after this point*    In the end, the main character and her friend are the victors in the Games. Everyone else in the arena dies, and they are the last ones standing. Yes, yes, that's all well and good, but in the end, what triumph is it? In the end, their oppressive government will still continue its tyrannical regime. In the end, it's no victory for them at all--it's only a victory for the Capitol, who has managed to beat them down to the level of murderous animals. The entire time, you're waiting for Katniss, the main character, to finally get fed up with the whole thing and instigate a rebellion. Even if it were quashed in the end and she and all of her co-conspirators were killed, it would be more fulfilling than seeing her be alive at the end but never really free or happy. Even if she and Peeta had committed suicide on the banks of the river as they were about to do, it would have been better--that, at least, would have been their own refusal to be puppets in the hands of the Capitol. In the beginning, you think the book is going to be a tribute to the triumph of the goodness in human nature over the fear of retribution or death. In the end, it's just the opposite.     Overall, an engaging story for the thrill, but disappointing.
B00005JNS0|3.0|For years I've been trying to explain my \\"no Disney\\" stance to people.  Grandparents.  Aunts and Uncles.  My own kids.  People act as though I am out of my mind when I say the movies are too suspenseful for little children, lacking in positive male role models, somewhat vulgar, and hostile to families.<br /><br />So it's spring break.  We got Cars.<br /><br />You can be sure a Disney movie will have engaging characters and a snazzy plot.  Cars does have those.  But... Wrapped inside this amazingly beautiful animation are some rotten spots.  Now I'm hoping my kids forget this movie quickly.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen raced a train because he was in a hurry, and my heart just sank.  What did my kids just see?  How do you undo that?<br /><br />Language like \\"moron\\" and \\"hillbilly hell\\" and \\"holy shoot\\" -- who wants to hear that coming out of a child?  Because they are *going* to repeat it.  Lightning disparagingly calls Doc \\"Grandpa\\" and rejects his advice.  Nice.<br /><br />I want to watch a movie with characters my kids can emulate.  The outside world will come soon enough.  I don't want this movie to be a formative one for my kids.<br /><br />And so you say, \\"Lighten up, it's just a movie.\\"  Well, ok.  But what goes in through their eyes, stays in there.  Otherwise, why would marketing work?<br /><br />Anyway, once is enough for this family... and I remain a Disney skeptic.  Sad.

B001EYGOEM|1.0|Fearless by Taylor Swift just didn't impress me at all. Her songwriting is average, not sure why everyone thinks she is another Bob Dylan? The only song that she shines on is The Way I Loved You. Taylor's voice is flat and weak, if you have ever heard her live then you know what I am talking about. Not sure what all the fuss is about? Maybe because she's young and blonde, her talent is medicore.

B000MV90IU|4.0|Bullitt (1968), is a modern thriller, even 40 years later,  incredibly, which is proof that skill, experience, professionalism  and team work sometimes results in a timeless filming achievement.    The cinematography is simply outstanding, superb, the clarity of  the DVD release is remarkable, with a glossy visual quality present  throughout the movie, whether the closeups of the actors, the  transparency through glass doors and windows or the bright  reflections on  the painted finish or chrome of American  automobiles shown.    Despite the hard-edge reality to the story, the authors had the  wisdom to counter-balance a lot of the horror (blood packs going  off, shotgun and pistol action)  with the calmness, relaxed mood of  Charles Mingus-style jazz music during even the most tense action  scenes, so as to not freak out anyone in the paying audience.    There does seem a conscious effort by the script writer to  demonstrate American technology to viewers,  underlining the modern  times  having arrived ... ready-made foot products, wide-scale  airports, mega-cities, telephones, fax machines, coroner and  autopsy work, emergency rooms and the medical teams and equipment,  radio communication in cop cars, intercontinental flights a moment  away (Italy, London), ambulances, superhighways, automatic garage  car washes, etc.    At the same time, a traditional story-line is present with the  classic tug of war between process and objectives, the ends  justifying the means, the merit of a supervisor taking the heat  allowing the street level employees in doing their jobs, confronted  with a necessary bureaucracy,  with many parties following events,  whether the public, the high level of management in law  enforcement, the detectives, the gangsters.    McQueen makes his mark, as a police detective, by always having a  solution to minor (or major) obstacles along the way, impeding  progress to his objectives, whether it's by greasing the wheels to  make them turn, ( favors or small gifts) so as to get information,  get access, keep the ball moving. He also does by realizing in a  split second how the high level cop, played by Robert Vaughn, is  more than ready to place all of the blame on the low level cop, so  he needs to take  steps to avoid seeing his career end.    As well, it brings into focus the houses of mirrors that a conman  can create to throw the blame on another person, as easily as the  house of mirrors he created to misappropriate  off 2 million USD  underworld mone.    The actors are splendid in their maturity, professionalism,  no-nonsense approach while maintaining a warmth to the viewing  audience. There is something for everyone in this work - romance  with a baby-faced 16 year old looking Bisset,( seen in a long dress  shirt and underwear), or the thrilling car chases in San Francisco,  (with a magnificent view to the blue sky and bay  in the backdrop,  as the cars descend steep streets at full speed), or the  astonishing clarity of filmed street chases (reckless, insane  speeds, death defying, during which actual public in broad daylight  is present as well as other  cars, buses.)    Norman Fell, got his break here, later starring as \\"Quincy MD, in  his own series.  Robert Duvall has a very brief spot  as a cab  driver. The release is wide-screen, with subtitles.
0440241030|4.0|I'm fan of both detective and special forces type stories, and this book pleased me on both fronts.  I liked it a lot more then the Rainbow Six books which feel tactically accurate but are populated with empty characters.  The characters in The Hard Way are sufficiently believable and the story kept me guessing.  Some have pointed out various holes in the plot, etc, but for me the test is not how well it stands up to a literal comparison with real life, but how well it holds my attention.  I had no difficulty \\"suspending disbelief\\" and thoroughly enjoying it.  I would have liked a slightly different ending, but Jack Reacher, like the Lone Ranger, always has another episode to prepare for :-)
0767817710|2.0|Because \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" stars Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Russell Crowe and is energetically directed by Sam Raimi it works better than it should. The story is an all too familiar tale of  revenge that is full of cliches. Even with the big name stars, the best performances are by the supporting players like Lance Henriksen, Keith David, and Kevin Conway. Ellen, a.k.a. The Lady (Stone) drifts into the town of Redemption to discover that the citizens are under the oppressive rule of  Mayor Herod (Hackman). He takes half of their earnings and collects at the end of each week. Desperate to be rid of him the citizens pool their limited funds and hire an assassin to take him out. Herod can't figure out who the professional is since Redemption is overcrowded with killers who are  in town for the annual Quick Draw Contest. Participants include Ace Hanlon (Henriksen), Clay Cantrell (David), Scars (Mark Boone Junior), and the Kid (DiCaprio). The Kid is the reigning fastest gun and also Herod's son. Ellen enters the competition under the assumption that she has her eyes on the $150,000 prize but she has other motives. When she was a little girl Herod murdered her father, before her eyes. After all these years she has returned to Redemption to kill him. The last, and most unwilling, participant is Cort (Crowe). At one time Cort was Herod's partner but he later found God and renounced his violent past. Herod forces Cort to participate and Cort tries to save his and Ellen's soul as the tournament progresses.  The leads all turn in disappointing work. Stone is horribly weak, Hackman is repeating his \\"Unforgiven\\" role, DiCaprio's Kid is too young and cocky   and Crowe is far too solemn.  Raimi livens things up during the battles with his usual tilted angles and quick zooms but the story and the film grow tiresome. There are occasional moments of fun and excitement but it feels more Dead than Quick as it rolls on.
1932100660|5.0|T. Colin Campbell has written the most amazing book ever written showing how all foods impact on our health -- some make us healthy, but the majority make us sick.  Now we can learn exactly which foods are deleterious to our health and send us to doctors, most of whom don't try to find out the real cause of our sickness.  Most doctors almost always give us drugs to heal us but which actually only mask the symptoms and greatly harm us.  We also can now learn which foods are incredibly nourishing and build our bodies to be healthy and full of energy so that we won't allow them to deteriorate and get sick.         Naura Hayden

B001AX9DT0|5.0|The first time I heard \\"You Are The Best Thing\\", I loved it.  I had to listen to the rest of this guy's album.  I had never heard of this guy.  Where in the heck did this guy, Ray LaMontange, come from?  WOW!  What a great sound.  It takes a lot to really make me fall in love with a song, let alone an album the first time I hear it.

055358894X|5.0|Wow! Lies of Locke Lamorra defies description, but it also defies you to put it down.  This crime-caper of a novel set in a world once populated by aliens, devoid of most technology, with a bit of magic kept me enthralled from the start.  Lamorra is a bit like Oliver Twist; they're both orphans who fall into service with mentors whose goal is to teach the orphans how to steal.  The book threads around two central plot-lines: Lamorra's newest and boldest scam, and an attempted take-over in the city's underworld.  The chapters are broken up with past vignettes that show how Lamorra and his crew came to act the way they do.<br /><br />This is an intelligent, clever, and at times funny book.  It is always entertaining.
B000G6BJS0|5.0|I absolutely love 9 of the 10 disks in this set. Disk six is defective. I have tried it in three different CD players or computer CD drives. The disk will play in all three, but there is persistent noise and crackling on top of the music throughout the disk. There are no scratches or apparent damage. I think it's a bad pressing or some other form of manufacturing defect. Another reviewer made this comment on this set giving it one star. I am placing my comment here as I want to make sure buyers are adequately warned. As I've said, the disk does not appear to have any damage and in light of the experience of the other reviewer, an exchange does not seem to have a high likelihood of resolving the problem.    I proposed that Amazon give me a discount on another recording of Shostakovich's 7th, the only symphony on disk six. Since I had not listened to all 14 symphonies within 30 days to check them for defects, Amazon would not compensate me in any fashion. I bought another recording of the 7th, no big deal.    Fast forward to February 18th, 2009. I purchase another EMI box set: Beethoven - The Complete String Quartets / Alban Berg Quartet. The last two minutes of the first disk, the final movement of Quartet in F major, Op.59 No.1, the first \\"Rasumovsky\\" quartet is full of skips and other sound defects. Nothing visible. It's factory direct incompetence. I'm now checking the other disks, but its March 20th. Burned again. Fortunately in this instance, I already have another set of Beethoven's middle string quartets. Hopefully it's just the one disk. I'll have to listen to find out. I understand if a box set is labeled a \\"budget\\" set because there may be a consensus that there are better recordings available, more highly appreciated interpretations, or both, but the CD should work, and one shouldn't have to listen to 5, 10, or 20 hours of music as soon as they buy it to ensure they're not getting screwed. I'll never buy another disk from EMI again. I've bought 100s of CDsand to have this happen twice in six months with the same label is simply unacceptable. They are now black listed. It's a shame, because the music's great, but I cannot stomach giving EMI another penny. How much can they possibly be saving by failing to implement reasonable quality control in their factories?

1582701709|4.0|The success of this book is its presentation of ideas that draw from quantum physics, visualization and positive thinking, the Chinese concept of \\"Qi,\\" collective mental energies, and a host of other ideas.  Bringing such diverse concepts together as a coherent and succinct thesis was an achievement, and I believe that is what explains much of the book's popularity; i.e., there's something for everybody.  My German girlfriend already had several volumes on this topic, and much of this has already been covered in European publications.  An English book on the subject was welcomed.  Although I found the never-ending \\"feel good\\" text and quotes to be a bit much, I also noted just how thought-provoking the chapters were.  Worth the money, but only you can decide if the authors techniques are legit.

6303575617|4.0|This is the lower body workout from Cory's Basic Sculpting Series.  It is about 30 minutes long and works your lower half nicely.  Cory is joined here by Michelle and Dave, Michelle demonstrates the exercises on machines that are found in fitness spas, Dave demonstrates on machines found in weight training or bodybuilding gyms, and Cory demonstrates using home equipment.<br /><br />There is no formal warmup, Cory and friends are all on various exercise machines (bike, stepper, Nordictrack style machine) warming up while Cory talks about the workout and what you are going to be doing.  I would have preferred a warmup but I can just use another video or march in place while she is talking.<br /><br />The workout follows, she does 2 sets of 15 reps of these exercises:<br /><br />squats<br />leg (quad) extensions (Cory uses ankle weights and does both legs at once)<br />lunges<br />hamstring curls (one leg at a time)<br />leg press (Cory does sissy squats)<br />step ups (similar to the tall box step ups/leg press seen in Firm videos)<br />calf raises<br />hyper extensions/Good Mornings<br />ab work/crunches<br /><br />I do make some modifications to these exercises, I personally didn't care for the sissy squats so I sub plie squats in place of those.  For the hyper extensions/Good Mornings, I subbed dead lifts as I didn't feel comfortable with a barbell on my shoulders and bending forward.  I think someone not familiar with proper form could really hurt themselves.<br /><br />This workout is definitely doable for those who are limited to home equipment, even though it make not appear so.  Some might get annoyed with the taking on/off ankle weights between other exercises, I personally didn't mind too much, gives me a chance to catch my breath anyway.<br /><br />I really like these workouts and have all three in the series.  They are short but thorough, plus I like Cory as an instructor.  She is pleasant but down to earth and laid back.  Plus her shape is very inspiring.<br /><br />These tapes were made in 1995 so they may appear dated to some, I have videos that are much older though so it doesn't bother me. The setting is clean but plain and the music is mostly instrumental keyboard music.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these to those already familiar with weight training as the form pointers could be a little better.  But they really are suitable for all levels, advanced people might find them a little boring.  They are right up my alley though, good for those who like simple straightforward weight lifting.  4 and a half stars!eos that are much older though so it doesn't bother me.

Great performances from a bygone era at a low price.

0312383320|4.0|Ok, so I know that I am in the minority here but I didn't think this book was horrible, silly yes, horrible no.  I am looking for entertainment and laughter in these tough and troublesome times and that is what Ms. Evanovich has provided me.  When I'm in the land of Plum I feel like I am with old friends some who haven't moved forward some who have not and may never,  it just feels familiar and lighthearted. I know when I pick up any of the Plum books that it is not going to be some heavy serious story so I can't fault it for that and as for the price, try the LIBRARY you can't beat the price there.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|I haven't seen this movie for 30 years or more, but as I watched, I felt the same sense of fear that I did as a child.  Even my teenage children, who are long since used to more graphic scenes,sat with their eyes glued to the television.  Frankenstein still thrills audiences of all ages.  This is a must watch. We also enjoyed the extra information provided by the anniversary edition.  This version is well worth the purchase price.

B000R8YC18|5.0|Travis Binkle (Robert DeNiro), a Vietnam veteran, takes a job as a taxi driver because he can't sleep at nights. While driving around, he becomes obsessed with \\"cleaning the scum from the streets\\", and in particular, with saving a 12 year old prostitute (Jodie Foster).<br /><br />It's sometimes hard to remember that Robert DeNiro was once a serious actor and not a semi-comedian who has sunk to the level of self-parody. However, watching \\"Taxi Driver\\" makes you realize how DeNiro gained his reputation in the first place. It is DeNiro's performance that makes \\"Taxi Driver\\" and without it, this film would have been long forgotten. That's not to say that the script, directing and other acting aren't also great. It's just that, the focus of this film is on one man's descent into madness and obsession, and without a convincing actor in the lead role, this film would not have worked. The intensity of DeNiro's performance translates well into Binkle's own intensity in his crusade.<br /><br />\\"Taxi Driver\\" has a reputation for the levels of violence that it contains, but with the exception of the final 10 - 15 minutes, it is actually surpringly non-violent. Having said that, this is a very disturbing film. Watching DeNiro practice pointing a gun made me wonder if this is what mentally unstable killers are like just before they commit a crime, and it comes as no surprise to hear that this is the film that inspired John Hinckley to attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />This film well deserves it's place on many \\"greatest films\\" lists and hopefully it will continue to remain on such lists for many years to come.

MORE footage, Behind the scenes info (which I was DYING to see) and nice pics to go along with the whole set. One word - WONDERFUL!
0895260131|4.0|What Trifkovic writes is in full accordance with my own experiences with Islam students and imams in Pakistan and Iran. It is of course not so with the majority of the people living there who would reject a basic hostility towards non-muslim people. It seems that it is a great boon to mankind that most muslims are no scriptural-orthodox Islam followers whereas it is a great tragedy that most Christians do not keep to their holy scriptures. The author does not condemn the muslims, but he is critical to a belief that helped Islam to spread in the past only by the power of the sword and could do so in the future if the West does not want to realize the threat that the Islam incorporates.<br />My observation in islam countries is that the broad public is misinformed about the West, Christian belief and its own religion being steadily influenced by the clerics and fundamentalists who use all means of propaganda. Since most people there are uneducated and the media are under control they have no access to world information and are prone to all sort of enticements.<br />One aspect the author also exemplifies is that there is no peace among muslims themselves! The hate towards Israel holds them together. This is sth the muslim clerics also understand. If there was no Israel we had yet war among the muslim statesin the Middle East.<br />Trifkovic titled his work \\"Sword\\" because it is the major instrument of Islam and also of Islam`s \\"peace\\". What in the American wild west was called peacemaker (a shotgun) is in Islam also a deadly weapon. It is well known how Muhammad used this instrument. This can be read in the Quran. His biography has a trail of blood, not blood of self-defence but of assassinations, mass-murder, executions and attacks. The question of Trifkovic is whether Islam has changed? Is there a reason why Islam should change? The world is still not set free of un-believers.<br />The successors of Muhammad went on with the \\"peace\\"- tactics. In obedience to AllaH`s command to behead apostates, Muhammads successor and father-in-law, Abu Bakr, and loyal Muslim warriors killed seventy thousand former Muslims, because they had decided to stop to follow this blood-dancing. So arabs killed arabs, former muslims killed by muslims. This was called in history the \\"Wars of the Apostasy\\".<br />But there were also the wars to legalize the follower of Muhammad and find the true leader. Muhammad`s closest companions and staunchest disciples (some of whom he had praised to be perfect followers) fought each other for wealth and power. That was peaceful Islam among muslims. In the Iran - Irak war and now the Shiites and Sunni parties in Irak prove how Islam is peace even within its own borders. In Afghanistan rival Muslim warlords still fight another. In Pakistan muslims of one party assassinate muslims of the other party. And like in Irak infidels from the West have to intervene to stop fighting and bring some civilized order into that chaos of \\"peaceful\\" Islam. This only deserves to be mentioned, because Islam claims I deed peace within its own house. But I said already that muslims mostly are no real muslims. On the contrary to the treatment of the fidels, infidels can be killed to conquest their lands and possessions for the Islam. And that is what they did industriously.<br />In 712 muslim raiders under Muhammad Qasun began the invasion of India, demolishing temples and palaces and massacring entire cities. As in Constantinople, where the streets would one day run with blood, the slaughter went on for three days in India`s port city of Debal. Trifkovic writes: \\"the massacres perpetrated by Muslims in India are unparalleled in history, bigger in sheer numbers than the Holocaust\\"<br />The Abbasid dynasty ruled until 1258 and under them the Islamic empire reached its zenith of power, prosperity and learning. The slaughtering went on during the conquest of Spain. Violence is inevitably the fruit of Islam in its complete history. Is there anyexample that can be given where Islam ever brought peace anywhere to any people? It could be questioned. There was also slaughter of Christians in the whole Middle East. In the process of the conquest, the Christians of Damascus were killed or sold into slavery, their churches burned down. The same procedure almost everywhere. According to Runciman in \\"The history of the Crusades\\" The Sultan Baibar had all the population decapitated when they surrendered.<br />In 1400 another typical leader devoted to Islam swept from east to west leaving behind a trail of blood. Timur or Tamerlane devasted countries and towns. He ordered executions in the tenthousands, mostly Christians. At Sivas 4000 were buried alive. \\"Historians estimate the number of dead at Sary to be 100.000, at Bagdad 90.000, at Isfahan 70.000.\\" If this is true, most of the victims must have been muslims because these countries were already muslim.<br />Islam excelled even the Catholic church (which is said to be a \\"Christian\\" church) in the number of atrocities. These are only examples of a long list of the successful spreading of Islam peace all over the world.<br />How was Islam stopped? In Europe it was Karl Martell in the west and the Austrians with strong support of the Polnish inthe east of Europe who stopped the Islam with the very sword Islam had drawn. How could Islam be stopped today? It is widely suggested with appeasement politic. Any possible threats are swept under the carpet of political and religious indulgence! If the arabs had no oil, who would care for \\"tolerance\\" of religions in the west? If the West would not be militarily strong, which arab would care peace talk, which is now necessary to survive?<br />Is there a wilful blindness on the part of the west and the determination not to face the truth about Islam climbs to ever higher levels of naivete? So much that extreme Muslims need not hide their vicious agenda. The Hamas website boldly proclaims to a world that refuses to believe that the horror can be real: \\"We are a nation that drinks blood, and ... there is no blood better than the blood of the Jews.\\"<br />Now this is irrational! Yes, that is also what the victims of muslim swords thought before their throats were cut. Instead the West continues to blame Israel (she has no oil!), for not making \\"peace\\" with such enemies. It is very strange what happens out there. Even the 11/9 event could not awaken the dreamers.<br />This book can be recommended., I think even the Hamas could distribute it. It must be recognized that it might be not too late to save the majority of muslims from the propaganda of the extremists.iven where Islam ever brought peace anywhere to any people?

B001HYY35G|5.0|The documentary is random, sexy, and violent, just like Justice. It will leave you with questions but you will understand the Justice phenomena a bit more. The Album is...just wow, its more rocky-hardcore than their previous stuff but satisfies the electronic sound that every beat lover needs. Track 8 particularly blends punk/electro with blues beats it was genre changing. Simply put, extraordinary
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Once again, Ms. Swift has created a great album.  Though many of the songs have that \\"made for 11 year old girls\\" feel, this really is some wonderful, fresh sounding music from someone with real talent.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone interested in country music.
B001B67VR2|4.0|I really liked the production quality on this album. When I first heard please don't stop the music, I thought it was hot. It's got killer beats, great singing, and the video was intersting to watch. I'm not a rihanna fan,but I will say that most of this music is pretty decent. I thought Disturbia video was trying to push her into more of an edgyness. But the song sucked! Umbrella was pretty good and catchy, I liked it! Take A bow(she calls that a ballad, I never liked that song!). Rehab was pretty good when it came out. The songs beats were not too over the top, and the song seemed very well controlled. Shut up and Drive kind of have to get into. I loved If i never see your face again(but thats a maroon 5 song not hers). I'm really not giving her much credit because they could have sang that by themselves and it still would have sounded nice. I think this def. going to be her peak album. it's going to be hard to reduplicate all the hit singles on this cd. It's been a hit cd for like 2-3 years now. Plus half the songs are hits. I don't really think she's going to stay around for long, but that's what i said after her first hit song.....
0143036556|4.0|In his book Diamond asks what the world will bring to collapse, over-exploitation, population growth, politics? What has to be done to prevent the decline of our civilization? He does not claim the impossible. He does not want to be too idealistic, he proposes to find a solution on the ground of accepting the economic realities. He came to his conclusions with the help of scientific research as a source of data to understand in what situation we are now. He shows the examples of some cultures that were successful and others who did not survive and tries to draw conclusions. As we have acted wrong in the past and as we are subdued to natural changes the most important thing seems to be to find the right reactions on the emerging problems.<br />Diamond starts in his book with a detailed demonstration of the economical history of Montana where a overuse of groundwater effects the fertility of the soil. He was many years a researcher in New Guinea where as a representative of WWF he had to develop a nature protection project. It was the usual business there to build broad streets to exploit the oilfields in the forest which was destructive to the fauna. In Haiti the French had another colonial politic than the Spaniards. The wealthy agrarian economy had to be paid by the destruction of the forests and soil. When the French left the country, the slaves destroyed the plantations and the economic downfall of Haiti began. There is no forest on Haiti as a result of deforestation. There is no timber for construction, a retreat of soil fertility, steady erosion, the failure of rain. In China the most decisive reason for the environmental pollution is the per capita waste of resources and the production of garbage. The Vikings cultivated Greenland successfully with traditional methods. But as a result of over-pasturing the soil erosion started, additional to climatic changes.<br />The author wants to make clear that since we produce the environmental problems we are not only responsible to solve them. We are also able to do this. He says that the most important thing for success is to make the right decisions on two fields. The long-term planing and the willingness to think again about central values. The Vikings refused this and vanished. France and Germany changed their attitude towards one another which led in former times to war and destruction, but now became the driving force for innovative members of the EU. This is mentioned as an encouraging example.ble to solve them. We are also able to do this. He says that the most important thing for success is to make the right decisions on two fields.

0374139563|5.0|Over the past 60 years at least $1 trillion in aid was sent to Africa - yet, calls for even more grow steadily louder. Moyo - a native of Zambia, contends that evidence demonstrates that this aid has made the poor poorer. Real per-capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s. In other words, aid is not part of the solution, it is part of the problem.<br /><br />Even after aggressive debt-relief campaigns in the 1990s, African countries still pay close to $20 billion in debt repayments per year - at the expense of education and health care. Moyo also asserts that the roughly 500,000 individuals in the \\"aid business\\" have no motivation for that aid to succeed; meanwhile, well-meaning individuals such as Bono have choked off debate of its efficacy.<br /><br />The author claims that the most obvious criticism of aid is that it enables rampant corruption and bloated bureaucracies. In 2002, the African Union, an organization of African nations, estimated that corruption was costing $150 billion/year. Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, states that Zaire's former president is reputed to have stolen at least $5 billion from the country. Across Africa, over 70% of government funding comes from foreign aid - enabling those governments to avoid accountability to local citizens since they pay so little.<br /><br />In Cameroon, it takes a potential investor about 426 days to gain a business license, vs. 17 in South Korea. Under the auspices of the U.S. Food for Peace program, each year millions are used to buy American-grown food that is then shipped to Africa where it puts local farmers out of business.<br /><br />Moyo's bottom-line is that other regions should stop the largess towards Africa, and Africa should focus on becoming more attractive to private investment. This includes ceasing to be the source of the world's greatest number of armed conflicts.
B0016FX456|2.0|I received the set (book and movie) in good time but I just recently was able to watch the movie and it stopped and skipped 15 minutes in. I was tired and went to bed and have yet to have time to try cleaning it. The book was in mint condition!
B001144EBA|2.0|I personally liked her first album when it came out. I thought it was catchy,poppy, and was fun to listen to. The only reason she really got popular was because she was smart and expanded herself catering to a more \\"White\\" audience. Especially with the unfaithful video. When this came out I thought there were way way too many carbon copies that out there and to me this seemed really medieocure. Even compared to Beyonce(and i was getting tired of her). Unfaithful was ok. I don't really think she can sing that well, well at least ballads shes got more of a pop voice(which is ok). My favorite track was Kisses Don't Lie, I actually think she'd be a better rock singer then pop/r&b singer. This track is a hidden gem and really shows that she's got some talent. I also loved SOS when it came out. i thought the video was fresh, the song was hot, and it had great beats. The rest of this cd and much of her career seems like kind of lackluster for me. She's really not that good to me, and alittle young for me. Even though were the same age. It just seems like she caters to the nickoledeon crowd to much!
0307387178|4.0|5 von 5 Kunden fanden die folgende Rezension hilfreich:<br /> The end of an idealist, 16. August 2008<br /><br />Glorious or inglorious, that is here the question. Alex Supertramp is a downshifter par excellence, who still needs at first the non-downshifters for his gradual self-realisation. He is an adventurer and freedom-seeker and he is not satisfied with little. He resigns materialism, the urges and lies of the American society and tries to break out into the wild nature, to experience \\"real\\" life. To late it dawns upon him that nature is no garden Eden and that some attainments, not so much of the civilization, rather of the socialisation are reasonable. It is a surprising end that Krakauer describes with the help of the diary of the unfortunate. The end of Alex is cruel and shows that it is vain to romanticize nature. Unfortunate could be the wrong word. If Alex would not have renounced such reasonable artefacts like a map, which he intentionally left back, or at least if he had informed about the locality, he could have made it easily to survive. That he wanted it is shown clearly by his desperate struggle against death. Experienced adventurers always calculate with emergency cases when they plan their special tours. Idealism needs carbohydrates! Alex was sheepish, overambitious maybe simply silly. Yes, exaggerated idealism is sometimes nothing else than density.<br />But it would be wrong to judge this young man. He made a decision and he paid for it. Did he find self-determination? No, no man can exist for himself, the freedom some are searching is nothing but an abstract and nature is not nice at all! She is like she is. Without man she is nothing at all. Nature is there for man, but she does not know it. But man has to know it.<br />The sojourn in nature is a good opportunity for self-reflection. Krakauer implies that Alex could have reached the goal to live his idealism until the very bitter end. He is not different to mountaineers who notwithstanding the risks want to have their extreme experience. There is nothing left than the hope, that instead of the romantic transfiguration of a life in the wilderness or the intended union with nature - a thing that cannot exist - in the face of death the simple recognition prevailed that life, that loves and can be loved is the most sensible and praiseworthy. A lot of knowledge for a young man in our times.<br />A recommendable book. Krakauer did not draw conclusions. He did not want to interpret too much into it. Perhaps because he is guilty himself of extreme adventures.ng the risks want to have their extreme experience.

B001NOMNZW|5.0|This is the first High School Musical ever to go to a movie theater and I wasn't really shocked when I heard that in the summer of 2007 right after the release of High School Musical 2.  I did know before even viewing High School Musical 3 that was probably going to be the last bow for this class in the High School musical series I only say that because I have just recently heard there will be a fourth film, but with almost none of the original class. Right off the bat this film just looks pretty.  Director Kenny Ortega did a fantastic job on making this look like a musical movie, it just looks very pleasing to the eye.  The story really surrounds the theme of moving on and the fact that things change once one leaves high school, friends depart, and most heartbreaking some love relationship die.  For Troy and Gabriella High School Musical's Tony and Maria from [[ASIN:B00172R37I West Side Story [Blu-ray]]] that reality is coming to ahead.  This is more difficult for Troy just because he really doesn't know who he is. A theme that we have seen before in the first two films but he has never really dealt with it before.  Like it or not, Troy's story is relatable in the idea that most if not all kids don't know who they are or what career path they should choose and the world isn't going to stop turning just so you can decide.  Zac Efron did an amazing job in terms of balancing the emotional scenes, with the romantic scenes, with the comedic scenes.  He and Vannessa Hudgens gave their characters closure which I think every fan wanted to see.  There is more music and dance numbers in this movie than the other two films combined and it is probably in my opinion the best of the series.  Now, if you were not a fan of the first two films do not buy this movie, but if you were you will not be dissapointed.
B00197POXG|5.0|I'm glad I waited for this complete series set to come out, I ended up getting the holiday sale (maybe pre-order) price of 89.99 which isn't much more than a single season. I used to love watching this show in syndication, then lost the station it was played on with a cable change.<br /><br />Packaging could use some work. I was tempted to give this a 4 star rating because of the packaging, but I myself can't come up with a better solution for the 42 discs in this series without it weighing a ton or taking up an entire shelf. I just wish discs were easier to remove and replace, the slip in/out cases make me paranoid for scratches. That and I'm waiting for the heavy paper/cardboard to start to tear with use.<br /><br />Overall, a good set finally came out for this series. So, 5 stars for the complete series, even though I don't like the packaging, the product works as it should.
0807014273|5.0|\\"Say yes to life, nevertheless!\\" is the original title in the German mother tongue of Frankl He was a philosopher, doctor, physiotherapist and founder of the Logotherapy (not to be mixed with Logopedics). This is a medical science which emphasises the openness and the chances of a situation and of life, with the aim of encouragement. The pastoral help consists according to Frankl in the dedication to a thing, to another people, in the memory of fortunate moments, in the hope, in humour and in prayer. And even when the whole thing is limitless and inevitable, there is still meaning: to endure sufferings in dignity and with courage.<br />Frankl, a Jew, survived the Nazi concentration camps. His parents, his wife, his brother did not. Shortly after his deliverance he wrote this book with the programmatic title. He depicts herein the life in the camp with the point of view of a participating observer. This relativization helps him to keep distance to the frightful events. At the same time he receives hope in an almost dead-end situation. He advices the desperate people around him for a more biblical attitude of \\"Nevertheless!\\" and to acquire the consciousness that even the desperation of their fight cannot harm the meaning and dignity as long as the courage is preserved.<br />In accordance with that Frankl tried to be an encouraging example. He told them that he himself never thought of losing hope and lived to that. \\"No man knows the future!\\" Not only hope is for Frankl a worthy power for survival, but also love - and this is also something he experiences together with his co-prisoners.<br />For the novelist Basil Hume Frankl`s narrative of his day-dreams in the middle of a cruel camp-reality where he speaks in thoughts with his also imprisoned wife is one of the most moving reports about human love, that he ever read. In this text Frankl also shows in which respect man is more than just a \\"psychologic organism\\" what he was for Sigmund Freud. He is rather a spiritual being, an eternal creature. In this dimension man is not vulnerable and cannot get sick.<br />After his release Frankl developed his Logotherapy which is taught all over the world. Frankl held several professorships in the USA. He married again. At the age of 70 he acquired his pilot license with the reasoning that he need not acquiesce in everything from himself. He meant his fear of a comedown. For somebody who teaches always to stand up, a consecutive effort.eternal creature. In this dimension man is not vulnerable and cannot get sick.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I never watched this movie went it came out 15 years ago, and I thought I would rent it from Redbox yesterday (I had a free night promotion code). The movie was very funny and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. The movie is basically about a man who has to live the same day OVER and OVER again (probably for many years since he knows intimate details about other people's lives). It is a good romantic comedy and the chemistry between Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is excellent. They really shine in the movie.<br /><br />This film is right up there in classics with Mary Poppins and the Sound of Music. Hopefully I will never have to relive a day over and over again in my life, like Bill Murray's character had to. But if I did I would want it to be the 4th of July or Valentines Day. A major point of this movie deals with the banality of our existence since we sort of live each day without much change. It was funny how even though Bill Murray's character tries to kill himself in the movie, he wakes right back up at 6:00A the next morning...he is like a god or something!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|The only negative I have about this film is that it ended.     I loved every moment. The really did a great job sticking with Austen's orginal dialog and plot.
B0010358CG|4.0|This movie is cool. Lots kickbutt action, good story, but just a little bit too similar to the first one as far as the action goes. The blu-ray version of this movie is not much better quality than a DVD, I couldn't notice much of a difference between the clarity of this blu-ray and the clarity of the first movie which I have on DVD. So I think would have rather have gotten this on DVD. Overall it's a good movie though.
0739326740|1.0|Thanks to Dan Brown we know now a lot more of the history of mankind of the last two thousand years and what went wrong. Did you know that Jesus was married to Maria Magdalena and produced a child with her? Did you know, after the crucifixion Maria fled with the child to France where she founded the dynasty of the Merovingian kings? In the Merovingians the blood of Jesus lived on. Sad, that they did not know it!<br />Did you know that Emperor Constantin has manipulated the Bible to make Jesus to God and ban the women from leadership of the church? What a pity that Constantin did not know it! Did the Egyptians know that Maria Magdalena leads on the godly line of the egyptian Isis cult? No, they did not! But we today know it!<br />If you did not get all the confusion that this book makes possible, why not try the movie? In the film it is Leigh Teabing to explain the theory. Teabing is an anagram of the name \\"Baigent\\". Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh are authors of discussed Qumran and Gral-books. Their erroneous assertions were rejected by experts. But Dan Brown was inspired by them. He assembles in his book the full offer of the actual Christian conspiracy theories: Templer knights, Maria Magdalena married to Jesus, Symbols of Da Vinci, Opus Dei, the holy Grail. That is the fabric for millions to watch in the cinema.<br />How is this proved to be true? With mysterious signs, alleged suppressed informations, hints on Da Vince paintings and reinterpretation of church history. Browns and the films conspiracy theory swims on top of the superficial, religious, tolerant spirit of the post modernism with an antichristian spearhead. Not like Brown director Howard shows Robert Langdon rather as a sceptic, not so much as a follower of the grail-theory. Before the start of the film, star Tom Hanks stated: \\"If you take a film - even a hundred million dollar production - for hard cash, you make a big mistake!\\" The story remains what it is. A play of irritation and a confusing labyrinth. But the film shows also what the book is, a fictive novel!<br />Problematic only that the author asserts that his documentation is true! Rather dilettantish lie! For example the scriptures of Qumran are of pre-Christian times and have no relation at all to the New Testament. We have also to thank Brown that he seems to be the only one who knows what is in the mysterious documents of the Vatican - now the Vatican also knows about it!<br />It is strange to see that the Christians of the times of Constantin did not realize that all their holy scriptures, even the Gospels were falsified, although - believing that the Bible is the Holy word of God that nobody should falsify - they were very careful in keeping every word from the beginning in reverence like a treasure! And moreover strange that they changed their belief to the new belief of Constantin and his new scriptures! How silly, Dan Brown thinks his readers are? I fear just as silly as they really are!<br />Besides there are also text documents from the time before Constantin, for example Papyrus P 75, which contains great parts of the Gospels for Luke and John, with the same contents we have today. P 66 is even older. This does not harm the bank account of Brown!<br />Today we know thousands of Bible manuscripts from the 9th to 15th century which are all the same. Compared with the documents before Constantin there are no significant deviations, which is not surprising knowing about the veneration of the Christians for their holy books. Dan Brown uses the same senseless and empty arguments as the islamists, that they were falsified. He needs this arguments for his books of course. Brown even is silent about the fact that the koptic-gnostic \\"gospels\\" were never accepted by the church. Why? Because it was apparent that they were falsifications. Yeah, Dan Browns were also at work in the past!<br />That the New Testament is more reliable testified as original than any other manuscripts from the ancient timesis a well known fact. But not for novel readers. And Brown does not change that fact.ut not for novel readers. And Brown does not change that fact.
B000092T6M|5.0|Great stuff!  So as long as you enjoyed the film (in what I consider to be an instant classic), there is simply nothing here that will disappoint.    In fact, the extras disc I was most impressed with (as many DVD releases of films from years ago often contain nothing new).  The bonus disc is chock-full of features that make the purchase well worth it.  The documentary \\"Robin Hood: Myth, Man, Movie\\" I found most impressive, as it delves into not only the making of the film, but also interesting information as to whether Robin Hood really existed.    Again, so as long as you're a fan of this film, this pack is a must-buy.
0800141660|3.0|This movie was okay.     Emma Thompson looks too old to play Elinor.  I hated the character Marianne.     The men are blah...nothing special or exciting about them.      Pride and Prejudice has better characters.

0060523808|5.0|It is easy to think about IBM as the old guard struggling to keep up with the new crowd favorites such as Microsoft and Google. However, IBM's four hundred thousand employees make it a small nation, and one of the largest employers in the world - more than four times than Google and Microsoft combined. Imagine trying to make sense of that as a CEO, you are not managing a company; you are managing a small nation state with thousands of satellites across the world.<br /><br />The book is non-technical and easy to read. Lou Gerstner places a lot of focus on corporate culture and the initiatives that the company spearheaded under his watch to what is arguably one of the most spectacular business comebacks to date. A must-read for any entrepreneur or a business manager.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I hated this version.  They didn't stick to the true dialog and plot of the book. I did not like Kiera Knightly as Lizzy at all!!!!<br /><br />I give it 2 stars because the color/visuals was very well done.<br /><br />Give me the A&E version please.
B00018D3RI|5.0|As someone who was born years after this series ended, it's odd to me to be writting a review to praise something that, to many people, must seem simple and out-dated. In light of the drama and action of modern television, I doubt there are many fans of Starsky and Hutch under 30, but for those few of us that are out there, I'll try and put it in a modern light.        First of all, this series is great for what it is: an original buddy-cop series that came about in the seventies and was filmed with one camera, and was heavily editted for T.V. Unlike some of the more gritty series of today, there is no graphic violence or obvious sex (although the hints are certainly there), so I'd recommend it for a more casual look, or for younger audiences not already used to blood and gore. It's pleasant and fun, and, while not exactly suspenseful, interesting enough to keep you watching if you start.        Second, this is quite the revolutionary series, and, even if it isn't your thing, it probably should be watched for that alone. It was one of the first series with a mixed race cast, with policemen who didn't just follow the rules, and a sign of the times to people who didn't grow up in the midst of the seventies (from clothes to portion sizes to slang). From an entertainment standpoint, it's leaps and bounds above Beretta (similar idea, also funny) and historically, it has much more to offer than any of the contrived police shows of today.    And, finally, it is almost relaxing to watch. The episodes change from light and funny to somewhat more on the side of edgy, but there's none of the ego of modern shows where, if you miss one episode, you have no idea what's going on. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's a popcorn-series, not an addicting one (not compared to shows like House or Supernatural or Psych).        Besides that, season one is the best, like many series. They were still trying to get that second season, so the episodes are somewhat more intense than in other seasons, although season four has a bit more meat to it as far as changes to their careers and their health (can't get over that mustache, though.)
B00005R23S|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's reunion with the E Street Band in the Spring of 1999 quickly became the most hotly anticipated tour that year, and began a hugely successful second coming for the band that is still going strong today. In June of 2000, Bruce and co. capped their return with a 10 night stand at New York City's Madison Square Garden, the last two nights of which were documented for an HBO special and live album.<br /><br />13 years later, \\"Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band Live in New York City\\" remains the definitive document of Reunion era E Street. It doesn't possess the subpar sound mix on \\"Live in Barcelona\\", nor does it show a worn out, raspy voiced Bruce like \\"Live in Hyde Park.\\" \\"Live in New York City\\" shows a band on top of their game and loaded with energy. From the powerhouse opening \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down\\" to the chilling, controversial closer, \\"American Skin (41 Shots),\\" every song explodes. Highlights include a blistering \\"Prove It All Night,\\" a playful \\"Two Hearts\\" with the old Bruce / Stevie chemistry on full display, and a haunting reworking of \\"The River,\\" with a lengthy intro that gives since departed blood brothers Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici  ample solo spots to show off each of their respective chops. The mid-section of \\"Youngstown,\\" \\"Murder incorporated,\\" \\"Badlands,\\" the joyous \\"Out in the Street,\\" and a lengthy, gospel tinged \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out\\" is absolutely intense in the way it builds with each song, and there is not a flubbed line or missed note throughout. It is remarkable how on their mettle they were throughout these shows.<br /><br />The bonus disc contains several songs not featured on the broadcast or the two cd live albums. They include beloved E Street epics such as \\"Backstreets, \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" \\"Jungleland,\\" and \\"Thunder Road,\\" lesser known numbers such as the haunting \\"The Promise\\" (done by Bruce alone at the piano), \\"Don't Look Back,\\" and perhaps the highlight of either disc, a harrowing \\"Lost in the Flood\\" (a song they had not done at all since 1978), as well as rave-ups \\"Ramrod\\" and the hilarious, extended \\"Light of Day,\\" complete with a soulful rap about Jersey vs. New York. Closing the disc is the beautiful \\"If I Should Fall Behind,\\" giving each E Street singer a chance at a verse.<br /><br />The sound and picture still hold up well, and unless Bruce pulls out something spectacular from the Wrecking Ball tour, \\"Live in New York City\\" is likely to remain the best Reunion era E Street live document officially available.ng \\"Lost in the Flood\\" (a song they had not done at all since 1978), as well as rave-ups \\"Ramrod\\" and the hilarious, extended \\"Light of Day,\\" complete with a soulful rap about Jersey vs. New York.

0061139378|5.0|This has been an excellent read-aloud for my fifth grade classes over the last few years (as well as my own pre-teens). The descriptions of the characters and setting by Neil Gaiman are very well done. My students have learned to really use their imaginations to envision Coraline's \\"other\\" life beyond the drawing room. We were excited to hear of the movie coming out, but we were all terribly disappointed with that version....they held true to many of the \\"creepier\\" aspects, but added some scenes that took away from the true ambiance of the original story (original setting in England, so they had to remove any of the British vocabulary and settings to make it Americanized---yuck). Although a well-made 3-D movie, it just wasn't as magical as this wonderful book. I would suggest any parent get this and read it aloud to your child (10+)even if you have seen the movie (use it to compare both versions)
B000002Q88|5.0|I would probably have to get more of their more recent albums to say this, but this album held the most consistency from song to song and made it the most complete album they ever put out.    Many groups have done themed albums but rarely achieve the intended result  of getting across the feeling they wanted to tell fromt that story.    Styx probably did it best but minus Dennis Deyoung they no longer have that spirit.    Here Kansas not only achieves it and keeps that feeling going from one song to the next. Listening to it right now forgot how good the \\"House on Fire\\" Track was. Have to agree with another commenter \\"Rainmaker\\" is a great song.    The final song \\"Bell of St. James\\" finishes of the album and completes it just right.
0307269752|5.0|Forty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from her family's home town during the aftermath of a violent car accident. Ever since then, her grandfather, Henrik, has been obsessed with finding her murderer; now that he is approaching the end of his life, he needs to have the mystery solved once and for all. To that end, he hires recently disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist to re-examine all the evidence and find the answer, under the pretext of writing Henrik's biography. Along the way, Mikael acquires the aid of Lisbeth Salander, a skilled hacker who can find the information that no one else can. As they examine the clues, they find themselves drawn into a mystery that is far more than just the disappearance of Harriet, uncovering deeply buried family secrets and a serial killer that has been creating new victims for more than 50 years. The ending will surprise you!<br /><br />I had a hard time getting into this book. The beginning deals almost exclusively with the financial shenanigans at Mikael's magazine, Millennium, and it is not particularly interesting to read. There is a lot of necessary character development of Mikael and Lisbeth, as well as of the more major supporting characters, but at times it seems to just drag on. However, once we get into the mystery, and especially when Mikael starts to break new ground, the book gets fantastic. I had a hard time putting it down, and spent a lot of time reading at work when I shouldn't have been. Once the mystery was solved, the book then delved into Lisbeth putting her skills to use in taking down the man who had sued Mikael for libel at the beginning of the book, and then the story gets a little bit tedious again, although still interesting. I was rather disappointed with the ending, until I found out that there will be more in the series.<br /><br />Be warned that while this is not an exceptionally violent book in general, there is a lot of sadistic violence as a centerpiece of the mystery. Some parts are absolutely brutal to read and may turn your stomach a little. Also, don't forget the family tree that we are given in the beginning of the book; once you get to Mikael's investigation of the Vangers, it will prove to be invaluable. Overall, this was a fantastic book, a real page turner once you get to the meat of the story. Looking forward to the next in the series.read and may turn your stomach a little.

B001PPLIEG|2.0|In the last thirty years or so--say, roughly half the life of the Bond film franchise--it seems to me that the closer a Bond film stays to original Ian Fleming material, the better the film tends to be. Of course, this might just be me, because I'm a huge fan of the original Fleming Bond stories. And there are exceptions, of course--1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, for instance, managed to hold its own very well, as did 1995's Goldeneye. But when the producers stray from Fleming storylines, the plots often get so convoluted and tangential that they simply become vehicles for the next action scene. And when _that_ happens, I often find myself watching the scene and asking \\"What's the point?\\"    That was why I raved so much over Casino Royale. Not only did we see Daniel Craig become the best Bond ever (well played, and faithful to the way Fleming wrote him)--dark, very dangerous, but polished and with a touch of humor--we also had a plot that's as close to pure Fleming as we've had since--well, since 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service (or maybe 1981's superb For Your Eyes Only). Plus, the action scenes were both spectacular and neatly grafted in to the plot. That's why I had such high hopes for Quantum of Solace.    With this latest Bond outing, the initial signs were somewhat positive. The producers were using a Fleming title, which they hadn't since the 1980s if I remember correctly (unless you count Goldeneye, which is a nod to Fleming though not actually one of his titles). And they were using Craig again (how could they not? The man is perfect for the part). But sadly, the old pattern holds true. They got away from Fleming, and the result is the usual incoherence.    Rather than Flemingesque, Quantum of Solace is actually a retread of an earlier Bond film--and not a good earlier film, at that. Think about it: Bond on a trail of personal revenge up against a Latin America would-be dictator . . . yep, you've got it: 1989's License to Kill, a non-Fleming Miami-Viceknockoff that wasted Timothy Dalton the same way that Quantum wastes Craig. And, as with License to Kill, the villains, location shooting (for the most part), and plot simply lack interest. The only positive glimmers are Craig himself and the superb Judi Dench, who is putting even more teeth into the role of M this time around than last. There's still the element here, as in many non-Fleming Bond films, of incompetence (or even buffoonery) in Bond's fictionalized MI6, but it certainly doesn't effect M.    I will freely admit (as if I have to by this point in the review) that I'm a major Fleming partisan. But I also like a good Bond film, even the parts that aren't Fleming originals. But without some Fleming plotline that makes good use of Bond's character, a Bond film might as well be any old action films because (Carly Simon notwithstanding) others do indeed do action better these days, or at least as good. It takes Bond's character, as developed by plot, to make the Bond film distinctive.    The producers showed, with Casino Royale, that they can do it. While they didn't in Quantum of Solace, here's hoping they do it again (dare I say get their mojo back?) in the next Bond outing.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|With the way that this movie was tauted during this past   awards season, I thought I was about to discover a hidden gem   that was going to live up to all the hype!  Well, all I can say is that this movie didn't suck,   but in no way was it better than \\"The Changeling\\" or   \\"Benjamin Button\\", which both were great movies that completely   got dissed this year! I liked the craziness of the characters,   liked Javier Bardeem and Penelope Cruz's performances..  I completely got it, but still felt like I could've had a V8!!  This was another movie (like the miniscule   \\"Rachel Getting Married\\" or \\"Revolutionary Road\\")   that got way more hollywood machine hype   than it actually deserved!    This seemed like that kind of elitist artsy-fartsy year   in Hollywood where they picked obscure & esoteric movies   over real solid performances. This shouldn't have even been   in a category at the Golden Globes or The Oscars!  Just my humble opinion.    This movie gets 3 stars from me because it is an   interesting renter, but not strong enough that I would   add it to my DVD collection.  Well, all I have to say is \\"The Wrestler\\" and   \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" better be good or I'm gonna be pissed!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Fantastic product for the price.  They are superbly comfortable, crisp and detailed in their reproduction, and plenty loud even without a headphone amp.  The cord is long and detachable, protecting it from damage and making it easy to replace without having to buy a whole new set of headphones.  It's no wonder 240s have been the standard in studios for decades.  You can find better headphones, but once you pass the price point of the 240s, the return isn't worth the money you're shelling out.
B0000026CN|5.0|One of his best in the 80's....Other than his early stuff this is a fine example of Santana and there unique sound. Highly recommended.

B000BJS4OY|5.0|.......of a perfect record.  I bought this deluxe box simply because Born To Run is one of the finest records ever made by anyone.  I'm not a big Springsteen fan either, trust me on that.  Every album he's made after this (or before) falls short of what's found on this.  A DVD peformance of the band during this phase and the \\"making of\\" documentary are both compelling and worthwhile things to have.  Why wouldn't you want them?  Why would you want bonus tracks on the album itself for that matter?  What would bonus tracks do to enhance this record???<br /><br />Born To Run is perfection, and you never ever mess with perfect things.  The audio on the album itself is steller and the anniversary DVD's are more than worthwhile owning.  Folks like myself will love going back in time watching the recording session and watching a hungry E Street Band putting forth.  They'll also love listening to the albums' stories and tales being told again. Kids might even like what real rock music sounds like if they buy this.<br /><br />Five stars and beyond here.  This is such a no brainer of a purchase.
B001DDBCUK|3.0|I used to watch the TV series on HBO on occasion and found it to be (as one reviewer here put it) \\"light and witty\\". Sex and the City (The Movie) is much more heavy handed. There were few laughs during the screening I saw. Let's face it, Sex and the City is for the most part a glorified  soap opera.<br /><br />The main plot revolves around Chris Noth's Mr. Big getting cold feet just as he's about to get married to Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie. Mr. Big is nothing more than a big wuss--a one dimensional character who unconvincingly hurts Carrie's feelings at a crucial moment in their relationship. Two thirds through the film, Carrie suddenly realizes that she's responsible for the breakup--that she pushed Mr. Big into having a big wedding even though he didn't want it. But her insight is short-lived. When Miranda reveals that she ran into Mr. Big the night before the wedding and told him how horrible marriage is in general (she's upset because she just had a run-in with her estranged husband), Carrie (very narcissisticly) won't cut her best friend any slack.<br /><br />I had trouble with the denouement when Carrie and Mr. Big reconcile--I basically had trouble beliving that Mr. Big would have called off the wedding in the first place (he had ample time to call it off before and he knew how much the woman he loved would be devastated had he called it off at the last minute--but he goes ahead and inexplicably does it anyway).<br /><br />Why also would Mr. Big fall for such a confused person as Carrie, who wanted a showpiece wedding? And then suddenly at the end Carrie sees the error of her ways and now a wedding before a municipal judge is okay? I suppose the happy ending is obligatory in a movie like this but it would have been more intriguing if Carrie had remained true to her neurotic core.<br /><br />Samantha, whose character has the most comic possibilities, is wasted here. She's stuck waiting for her boyfriend to get back from work with her sushi dinner which she's placed all over her body. Not funny! And I didn't believe for a minute that she would remain true to her boyfriend with sexy hunk Dante beckoning her in every scene.<br /><br />For awhile, Charlotte has nothing much to do but get sick from the water while in Mexico and soil herself (again not funny!). More predictable shenanigans occur when Charlotte gets pregnant and has a baby (it's all heartfelt but nothing very dramatic).<br /><br />Finally there's Miranda's relationship with Steve which was perhaps the most realistic part of the movie; although Cynthia Nixon's character oftentimes became too mean and shrill for the audience to have much sympathy for her.<br /><br />As an actress, Jennifer Hudson will always do best in soap operas (the love fest between Carrie and her character was devoid of any meaningful conflict).<br /><br />Sex and the City would have worked much better had about 45 minutes of footage been edited from the final cut. Had more thought been put into the plot, it would have been a much better film. Still, the performances are entertaining and it will pretty much keep you interested to the end.ot funny!

B001GKJ2E8|1.0|'Wanted' begins with a shootout between two professional assassins in a high-rise office building. One off the assassins jumps to the rooftop of the other building where he murders all the people who are trying to kill him. However, when he jumps, he's able to fly across horizontally without falling to the ground. He's also able to control the bullets he fires from his gun making them bend around potential victims and then striking the targets he seeks. All this comic book nonsense wouldn't be so offensive except for the fact that the director enjoys reveling in the violence throughout the film. Bullets fly in slow motion and always seems to strike their victims in the center of the head with gobs of blood oozing all over the place.<br /><br />Brian McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, an office worker hooked on anti-anxiety medication. He's a wuss surrounded by his unlikeable boss, an obese woman who berates him all the time. His best friend humiliates him by having sex with his girlfriend in front of him on multiple occasions. Gibson is recruited by a 1000-year old secret society of assassins called \\"The Fraternity\\" led by Sloan (played by Morgan Freeman) who informs him that one of their renegade members, Cross, has murdered one of their best members, who just happens to be Gibson's father who he never knew. Apparently The Fraternity wants to train the hopeless Gibson because they feel being an assassin is in his blood. He goes through a very long-winded training period where various members of the group (including \\"Fox\\" played by Angelina Jolie) toughen him up by punching, stabbing and shooting him all over his body. Gibson must be subjected to numerous rounds of torture until he becomes 'egoless' and finally adopts the steel-like mindset of the professional assassin.<br /><br />The Fraternity is not without its new age pretensions for every time they beat Gibson to a pulp during their training session, they then put him in a bath, place some kind of clay all over his body (including his face) and fill him with vodka. Miraculously the bath and the vodka do the trick and he's up and about to face another round of beatings until he's ready to go forth and battle Cross. Meanwhile, Sloan reveals to Gibson how members are given their assignments. They work in some sort of textile factory where a loom weaves a tapestry which produces messages with some kind of secret code discernible within the fabric. Sloan seems to be the only one who knows how to decipher the messages and hence doles out the assignments. Gibson along with Fox end up shooting some guy in an office building while they're running from one subway train to another on an elevated track.<br /><br />Things get worse when Gibson finally is able to track down Cross and kills him but not before finding out that Cross was actually his Dad and the Fraternity had double-crossed him. In the laughable finale, Gibson drives a garbage truck full of rats armed with miniature time bombs and dumps them inside some European castle where the Fraternity are all ensconced. The rats explode and most of the assassins are killed. Sloan somehow escapes but Gibson dupes him (we never find out how) by planting a double in his old office cubicle.<br /><br />Just about like every other death in this film, Sloan takes a bullet in the forehead. The last shot in the film is Gibson holding his machine gun, cursing all his opponents and basically bragging what a macho guy he is.<br /><br />'Wanted' is basically trash for mindless 14-year-old's. The director is from Russia and famous for Vampire films. This would have been a much better film if he threw a few vampires into the mix. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie merely show up to cash their paychecks. Not only does 'Wanted' promote violence, it revels in it. In the perverted moral universe of 'Wanted', a winner is defined as the last thug left standing. Hopefully you won't pay $12 to see this trash. When it comes to cable, just flick your remote to thenext channel.

B0013FSL3E|3.0|Wall-e has a great concept: Due to the toxic effects of unchecked consumerism, earth becomes a dead planet and humans find themselves in a giant pleasure ship run by robots. This is perhaps the first film I've seen in a long time that takes the politically incorrect position that obesity is not a good thing. In the future, people have all become obese. They sit in pleasure chairs and mindlessly move around the ship on a conveyor belt of sorts, eating junk food and slurping drinks you would find at any fast food outlet today. Giant electronic billboards broadcast news about the latest products and the people of tomorrow all are in a great stupor.<br /><br />Meanwhile back on earth, Wall-e is the last functional robot, a waste compactor assigned to clean up the trash left behind. Earth is a dead planet and the people of earth have fled since nothing can grow there anymore. The mother ship sends out probes searching for signs of life. One such probe is \\"Eve\\" who Wall-e befriends and then falls in love with. Wall-e ends up finding a small plant which he gives to Eve as a gift. This is the 'evidence' that the humans have been looking for. Now earth is capable of supporting life again and the humans may return. Eve returns to the mother ship with the plant but Wall-e, love stricken, must follow her too. Eventually, the ship's computer confirms that earth can now support life again but not before the robot in charge of guiding the ship revolts at returning and struggles with the human captain for control. The Human Captain finally realizes how great it is to be on earth, gains control of the ship from the rebel robots and brings the mother ship back to earth. Wall-e, damaged from the fight with the rebel robots, is restored to his former self by Eve, who finds some replacement parts, and they live happily ever after.<br /><br />One cannot describe the inventiveness of the animation here. It is truly phenomenal. The effects are dazzling. But one feels that after awhile, some of the scenes are a bit repetitious. For example, there is this small robot who is assigned to cleaning up all the 'foreign contaminants' it finds within the mother ship. The cleanup scenes by this robot are overdone. Similarly, Eve's penchant for blasting anything that gets in her way becomes a little tiresome. Instead of one of two blasting sessions, we get about ten. Act I goes on a little too long. We should have Wall-e get on his adventure sooner (i.e., when he attach's himself to the ship and finds himself in outer space). Another weakness of the script is that the antagonist is not identified clearly enough into much later in the film. Halfway through, the robot controlling the ship suddenly becomes malevolent. That should have been established earlier. In addition, it was a little too easy for the Human Captain to suddenly \\"see the light\\" and regain his humanity.<br /><br />Wall-e is in the end, an enjoyable but somewhat sentimental love story between two robots. Its human characters are drawn more as comic relief. Had the screenwriters drawn the humans as a bit more multi-dimensional, this could have been a more compelling film. As a romance, Wall-e is cute and sweet. But the overall story will be favored more by comic book aficionados. Walle's dazzling special effects create on a visual level, a feast for the eyes which must be seen.are a bit repetitious.

B0002DB52M|4.0|Denmark's Lars von Trier, one of their finest directors, is also one of the most polarising filmmakers today.  He's been rather quiet as of late, not making a film since 2005, but he's still out there.  This film, Dogville, alternates between being brilliant, astonishing, and frustrating, but it's undeniably a work of art that has many cheering at the end and some demanding their money back.<br /><br />The film is shot in von Trier's hand held, digital video style that he's used since his TV series, The Kingdom (this was the series that Kingdom Hospital was based on).  While I generally dislike hand held camerawork (it's way overdone in my opinion), von Trier's hand held style is not straightforward.  It's a hand held/jump cut style, where von Trier gets to the heart of the scene with no desire for strict continuity.  In the hands of a lesser director, this would be a disaster, but in the hands of Lars, it works amazingly well.  Von Trier operates the camera himself, with his director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle (the cinematographer who recently won an Academy Award for his work on Slumdog Millionare).<br /><br />This film concerns itself with many things.  America, idealism (and foolish idealism), hypocrisy, anger, foolishness, and the darker side of human nature.  The film is shot entirely on a soundstage with very few props, like Thorton Wilder's Our Town, where you imagine most of what's going on.  This technique lends itself to deeply fascinating shots, where von Trier holds a long shot where you can see inside two houses, and see what's going on in one house, while something related is going on in another house.  It creates a startling distancing effect, and it's quite effective.<br /><br />John Hurt's narration is quite caustic and acerbic, and he reads it very well.  The performances are very good, with Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany particularly good.  The only thing I don't really like about this work is the rather stilted English dialogue.  Von Trier has filmed in English many times, but his dialogue always has a tendency to be \\"learned\\" American English rather than \\"natural\\" American English.  He opens himself up to criticism rather easily because he's never actually been to America (he's afraid of flying).  Still, Dogville is worth watching.  It's von Trier's longest work (at 177 minutes), but it's fascinating and quite often difficult to watch, but it's worth it.sh many times, but his dialogue always has a tendency to be \\"learned\\" American English rather than \\"natural\\" American English.

B000654YK6|5.0|Very enjoyable film of the best music scene in the last twenty years - i was 15 or so when i first heard Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger in 1991, a week or so later picked up Nevermind and i was sold. Then it was Mudhoney and after that Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees, Gas Huffer etc. Still listen to those bands all the time and this film reminded me how good so much of that music was and is. A real nostalgia trip for any 30 somethings like myself who were saved from a Thrash Metal dead end by all things Seattle!
B000001ESP|5.0|When this album came out, it got one star in Rolling Stone.  I remember being rather infuriated by this (even at a young age), and I bought the album anyway.  It's one of Rush's best albums, and one of their most accesible.  It doesn't mean it's a sellout.  The music is undeniably Rush, and it has some of their greatest classics EVER.  Tom Sawyer is a great single, one of Rush's biggest hits, and still one of their best songs.  The next one, Red Barchetta, is even better, with some of Peart's most majestic lyrics ever, a great musical track, and a great vocal by Geddy Lee.  YYZ is a great instrumental, Limelight is a wonderful tune, but the most underrated song here is The Camera Eye.  It's a Rush epic (running 11 minutes) and it progresses beautifully, with melancholy lyrics by Peart and another great vocal by Lee.  Lee's voice isn't as histronic as it was when Rush first started out.  It's mellowed with age and it's become quite good.  The only complaint on this album is the last two songs, Witch Hunt (with a subtitle of \\"Part III of Fear\\", which I have no idea what that means), and Vital Signs.  Both songs are rather boring, especially the former.  Signs is a bit more lively, but after the brilliance of the first five songs, the last two seem like afterthoughts.  Still, Moving Pictures is a great album, one of Rush's finest works, and one that still resonates.
B001TODCII|4.0|A lot have complained about the similarities with the Bourne franchise. A lot have said that it's your typical, superficial action flick. They're right.     Yet why does it work so well? Surely, if it was bad knockoff, people wouldn't be rating it 5 stars. It's the cast. They, led by the impeccable Liam Neeson, carry the movie. Neeson is charismatic and believable as Bryan Mills, former CIA operative who tries to make up for the years he was busy doing what he does best: being invisible. He's lived most of his live in the shadows and wants to know what it's like to walk in the sun.     At first, it seems to work out well. His 17 year old daughter, humble and kind despite the luxury her mother and her rich stepdad bathe her in, welcomes her father back into her life with open arms. Her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) seems uneasy in his company, using every opportunity to jab at him. This seems like an attempt to convince herself she made the right choice rather than the character really disliking him.    All is well until daughter Kim tells Mills she wants to go to Paris with her best friend. This request seems innocent enough (I for one have visited Paris on my own when I was merely 16) but warning bells go off in his head. Maybe his life on the dark side got to him, or maybe it's that and a dose of concern for his only daughter. He says no, but after both Lenore and his daughter hounding on him, he grits his teeth and hands his daughter a whole list of places to stay out of.     She goes to Paris and what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime turns out like a visit to hell. She and her slutty friend Amanda don't seem to get along well at all and to make things worse, their sloppiness as a civilian got them kidnapped and sold into prostitution. Luckily daddy has some tricks on his sleeves and comes after her.     Where most good dads are like Teddybears, Neeson is a grizzly with some damn sharp claws. The tricks he uses are in the Bourne territory, but entertaining to watch nonetheless. The pacing is fast and what really helps the film is that Mills doesn't screw around. This guy pulls no punches. He doesn't tell his victims what will happen to them or why he does what he does. There's no fade to black or miraculous interference at the last moment. The scenes are thrown in your face and that's what makes this film work.      What I also liked is that Maggie Grace, (the 25-ish actress who plays Kim) really got into her role and made her character very believable even though she seems like your typical damsel in distress. She works with what she has and it adds to the movie.     The material might not be fresh but its executed so well that the flaws are forgivable. Sit back, enjoy the ride and when you want something that turns the wheels in your head, go watch Shawshank Redemption.    So why no five stars? For one, I would've liked the trafficking part to be fleshed out more. Showing what the girls went through would've added more punch to the movie whilst adding to the urgency of Mills' mission.     Overall a really good way to kill a couple of hours.
0439806119|5.0|Jose Alfonso-      This book was great! Uglies is about a girl named Tally Youngblood who is forced to live in a world obsessed with beauty. In the story all teenagers must wait until their sixteenth birthday to get the operation to become a pretty, but before the operation they are known as Uglies. While Tally is waiting for that day to come she meets Shay. Her and Shay have the same birthday so they can get the operation the same day. While they waited for their sixteenth birthdays they did a lot of pranks that they would not be able to do after they were Pretties. So the day before the operation came and Shay had decided she wanted to stay an ugly and run away to The Smoke where all Uglies could stay ugly for the rest of their lives and she had begged Tally to go with her but she wanted to become a pretty. The day of the operation, Tally was not allowed to get the operation unless she turned in her friend. So Tally had to choose over her friend and the operation. This book really relates to the world now and how it is obsessed with beauty. In the book the author also mentions how it was all because of the war and obsession over beauty of our time.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I ordered this CD for a road trip. It is great music. There is one hip hop type song on it I am not overly thrilled with as I do not like that genre, therefore I skip to the next song when it comes on. But otherwise it is a very enjoyable CD to listen to.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|When I see the talents of Meryl Streep squandered in films like \\"Mama Mia,\\" I am certain that her only absolution and redemption is to make a film like \\"Doubt.\\" Some may lament the subtle development of the characters and mystery and the equally subtle resolution, but for me it's about time we don't get some obvious ending where everyone and everything is happily resolved. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the priest with the perfect amount of good 'ole boy among fellow priests and bully--threatening any who dare question him. In a small scene in the film Viola Davis (for which she deserved the best supporting actress) and Meryl Streep discuss the options of a young black child in 1960's America. This small scene tells more than many  hand-wringing epics on the same subject. Amy Adams (who also was nominated for best supporting actress for this film) acted more as a catalyst between the giant roles of Streep and Hoffman, and in some respects depicted the bewilderment of the audience. Her doubts were our doubts. All of these actors deserved Oscars, as did the writers, directors and everyone else involved in the best film of 2008.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|A lot of critics of this film focus on the time paradoxes and implausibility of the plot, but if you can put that aside, this is a pretty good movie. In defense of the time silliness, I would say that first of all, the difference in time is only 2 years which makes the whole thing much more plausible. It doesn't require actual time travel for the characters to be together or be more or less the same age. Second, the plot device involving time doesn't get sillier and sillier as the movie goes on. It ends up being one small implausible aspect in an otherwise believable movie. As far as the actual romantic aspect of the movie goes, I would say there is definite chemistry, but the whole thing falls just short of being great. It's watchable and you really want the two main characters to get together somehow. Somehow the whole thing just seems to lack a bit of spark here and there. Maybe it's because both characters seem a little too depressed. In any case, this is a workable romantic film that's worth seeing.
B000002TYX|3.0|The Beatles Anthology 1 is a staple of diehard Beatles fans. It contains clip after clip of sound bites and off-takes of popular tunes.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|Babel moved 4 generations of our family equally. Here is a story that combines a Yuppie family, a Mexican caregiver (and her family left behind while she became intimate with her charges in California), impoverished Morroccon herding families and a whole village equally as poor, a well-go-do Japanese businessman whose deaf daughter is desperately trying to hook up to recover from her mother's death and her own isolation and profound lonliness. The people seem real, the settings seem real. There's no beautiful manicured Third World cometics in this movie. Poverty is dirty and ugly. Americans can be entitled and ignorant sometimes. Everyone has emotions. Everyone hurts. Sometimes people can be so generous it's unbelievable, and other times they're shockingly self-absorbed. This is a love story. A parable about how we're all related and how what we do reverberates across the globe with consequences we could never imagine. Utterly believable, utterly gripping, fascinating and inspiring. This is one of the four best movies I've ever seen. Even if Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are far from pretty here.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This earnestly is one of the finest achievements of cinema, particularly of it's time. Though hailed as only the third greatest piece of Japanese cinema of it's year, it has easily outlasted it's two predecessors. This movie is basically flawless. Multi-layered and symbolic, there is no wasted film in the entire movie. Every shot has depth and the storyline is fascinating.         It's storyline has been ripped off and parodied numerous times, from The Magnificant Seven, to the often boring futuristic anime of the same name, to video games, This is character development and using the cinema as a medium to portray statements at it's finest.       No matter how many times you watch it, you WILL notice something different, and noting how revolutionary it was at the time, it is truly mindblowing. Kurosawa has always been a master, but this is truly his masterpiece, and watching the master at work is atrue pleasure.       The acting is also sensational, particularly Toshiro Mifune (One of my favorite actors period) and Seiji Miyaguchi who until this movie has never touched a sword before. Still, every actor down to the most insignificant extra adds depth to the world of Seven Samurai. The script is fantastic, and no line is wasted in this three and a half hour film.       The class statements are just as relevant today as the time it was based in, and you really see see the main three classes (peasent, nandit, and samurai) as human. You even understand the plight of the bandits before the film is over. There is no black and white only gray circumstances, and ultimately that's what the movie is about more than anything.       There truly cannot be enough good things to say about such an epic masterpiece, and it will be continued to be revered in the future.

0452286751|4.0|The Fountainhead is a classic work of American literature, and so I felt compelled to read it--and I wasn't disappointed.  The novel is the story of architect Howard Roark and how he rejects the inferior, backwards- looking of the architecture of the past in order to be his own man and forge his own path.  The book is well-written and engaging.  I do not ultimately agree with the basic premise of the novel, namely that unfettered man is the greatest force in the universe.  In one place this is disturbingly celebrated in the book through a rape scene, which is presented as positive because Roark is exerting his will.  More often, it is represented through Roark's unwillingness to compromise professionally.  The novel is highly overt in its atheism.  (To put things into perspective:  Rand mostly likes Nietzsche, but finds him a little too weak and religious, if one can believe it)  Ultimately, I recommend the work--just keep in mind it's a text promoting a thesis and try not to get too riled up.

B000OVLBF8|1.0|I won't spend much time and energy giving my opinion on this movie. It's not worth it to me. It could have been a great movie, but is anything but that. If your over twelve or fourteen years old, i would not recommend watching this movie although no doubt many adults will find it \\"superb\\". I only write reviews for two types of movies. Movies that i had very high hopes for and was very disappointed and movies that i love. No love here. Just a bad taste in my mouth. I lost interest half way through this movie, which seldom happens to me. Enough said. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I wear two hearing.  My son works at night so we must keep the television low as not to disturb him.  My wife can hear the television at a low volume, however I have a problem picking up all the words and sounds.  I purchased the Sonic Super Ear Sound Amplifier and it significantly increases the volume of the television.  The only downside is that it is very sensitive to sound.  You must keep the microphone very still or you will get loud scratching sounds that hurt the ears.  What I do is set the sound volume then place the microphone next to me on the sofa and do not touch it unless I have to.  The amplifier also picks of all the sounds around you.  If there is a conversation in another room the amplifier picks it up and it could be a bit disturbing while I am watching television. It is also a bit harsh if someone is talking directly to you.  That said, I think that it is a useful tool for anyone who wants to listen to television or radio  without disturbing anyone. I guess if you are really hard of hearing the unit should help you hear conversations without a problem. I recommend the product to anyone whether you have a hearing problem or not.
B001T9O6UQ|5.0|After ordering two books at Amazon, decided to see if Ms. Gilbert's next book was out yet...     I loved this book so much, I bought about 7 copies for friends. I've never done that before! So out of curiosity, I wanted to see how others felt about this book...I was so disappointed, and surprised, by this first review I read!     I read this book this past summer, when going through a very difficult, lonely, depressed and anxious time due to a long string of personal tragedies. I had to stay home from our summer vacation at the beach, and read this while my husband and 4 kids were away for 9 days. A very lonely, sad, introspective time. This book was a life saver, especially the chapter on India.     For someone suffering throughh a similar emotional/spiritual crisis, this book was more than a comfort. It was often entertaining as well! I so appreciated her honesty about her most intimate doubts, fears, etc. It was also so inspirational for me - that she made it through to the other side, so to speak! This book is about one individual's INTROSPECTIVE journey through 3 years of coming to terms with her own demons, and inner growth.     As for some criticizing her as being self-absorbed, she raised money to buy a poor Balinese woman and her family a home! She also gave everything she owned, and worked for, to her husband, just to be released from an ended marriage. I'm not sure how that could be construed as self-centered.     She totally opened herself up to us, the public, and did so in such an intimate, and often self-deprecating way. I have two copies, I keep at home and my studio. Many pages are ear marked. Many passages underlined. I have it close by, anytime I need to hear from a friend (I have no sisters), and she feels like a sister to me after having read this book.     Maybe those who have never had to deal with the torturous combination of anxiety/depression/loneliness + extreme life transitions, will not appreciate this book.     There are poor and hungrypeople in my country, the USA. I don't expect every book written to focus on the poverty around the world. If she can inspire, and comfort other individuals, so they can go on to be productive, and loving, and help the world, I applaud her for her courage and honesty!

0743289692|5.0|BOOK REVEW:  TITLE: Infidel, by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, (Free Press, NYC, 2008) new paperback<br /><br />TEXT:  Usually autobiographies are written by much older people, but the life of this now nearly 40 year old Somalian woman captures events so dramatic, yet personal, that the reader will have a fervent compulsion to read until one discovers her present outcome.<br /><br />Born in Somalia to a conservative Muslim family, a chain of often violent circumstances initially of coincidence lead this young woman to a new life in the Netherlands and then to the USA from which she now writes a powerful autobiography.<br /><br />It will be very important for every non-Muslim from the West to read this book because it gives a crucial insight into the Muslim religion.  People may say that there are moderate Muslims, but if they subscribe to the letter of what their religious book, the Quran, states,  and practice Shariah, as this author so vividly describes, they are embracing a set of beliefs which are totally antithetical to our Western democratic root.<br /><br />But let me be clear.  The story of her fascinating life deserves more than just a quick recitation of events.  What readers will find compelling is truly an odyssey of heroic proportions, requiring her to slip the bonds of her culture, her culture's history, her family's immersion in that culture and history, even after she is genitally cut, and the over weaning society that supports such a system.  She exhibits enormous strength of character, huge mental toughness, and just plain good luck in getting to the enlightened Netherlands, to escape a forced marriage.<br /><br />There she becomes exposed to freedom and open human behavior she had never known to exist.  The effect on her is profound.  She makes many Dutch friends, she reads, she breathes the freedom, she gets an advanced degree from a university,  and finally realizes that (page 281) \\"I don't believe in God\\" .  \\"And I felt relief\\".  In short by the time she moves from her homeland to the Netherlands she has achieved an escape from what the author views as a medieval, cruel and unenlightened religion.  She writes on page 283, \\"Muslim schools reject the values of universal human rights. There can be no freedom of expression or conscience.\\"<br /><br />Ali becomes a Dutch citizen and astonishingly then becomes a member of the Dutch Parliament.  In stead of quietly marveling at her good fortune and keeping silent, she embarks on a career of forwarding women's rights and in the process finds herself in a controversy, involving death threats and protection from assassination which her Dutch colleagues find too much for them.<br /><br />The Netherlands has allowed so many Muslims to migrate there that her government was either unable or unwilling, even after the murder by a Muslim of her film co-producer, a Dutchman named Theo Van Gogh, to stand up for her strong position, causing her migration to the US.  This ending represents a cautionary tale for the US as it tries to absorb huge numbers of people from disparate cultures and religions and particularly offering us an eye witness insight on the true nature of Islam.<br /><br />Poignantly, while  she still treasures a picture of her father, who has cut off any contact with his only surviving daughter, she knows that she is never to return to his world and the intellectual prison in which he lives.  In 2005 Ali was named by Time magazine as one of 100 of the Most Influential People of 2005 along with many other awards reflecting her powerful influence on others about human rights.rlands she has achieved an escape from what the author views as a medieval, cruel and unenlightened religion.

B00005JPY2|5.0|A lot of mixed reviews on this movie but I really liked it. If you are a comic book fan you will probably like this movie. If you are not you may not like it or understand it. This was almost a 3 hour movie and it flew by for me which usuall means I really enjoyed it which I did. It is NOT a movie for kids as it has nudity, sex and a lot of gore. I thought the actors did a great job and it was well directed. Good job guys. I might see it a 2nd time and will buy the DVD for sure.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Like everyone else who has given this set 1 or 2 stars, we have concluded that the DVDs are defective.  We bought one set and noticed that many of the episodes skipped or simply didn't play (particularly in season 3 - just like the other reviewers).  After getting the same result when we tried to play it in other players, we returned it to amazon for a replacement set.  When the replacement set arrived, we encountered the exact same problem!  We thought we were crazy until we read the other reviews on this site.  For whatever reason, these sets have a major manufacturing defect & you should avoid them entirely.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|The Batman movie that's been 70 years in the making!  A perfect movie.  Takes nearly every aspect of the Batman mythology and, in continuation with the perfect set-up (Batman Begins), forms an epic film where, in my opinion, Batman was the weakest performance, and that's not an insult.  The supporting cast is superb.  Heath Ledger.  Enough said.  Gary Oldman deserved some kind of nomination.  Morgan Freeman is as classy and witty as ever.  Maggie Gylanwhatever redeems Nolan's poor judgment in formerly casting Katie Holmes.  Aaron Eckhart is brilliant.<br /><br />However, the DVD is a typical quick release.  Great featurettes, very interesting, but for the magnitude of this film, its release, and Heath alone, it's skimpy at best.  If you're a fan, you already have it, but I wish they would have done just the single disc until the Collector's Edition was released.  Oh well, I'd triple-dip for this movie if I had to.
1401207529|5.0|As far as I know, Frank Miller and Alan Moore were the best people ever attached to a Batman novel.  Batman: Year One is amazingly written.  I believe any Batman author should read this 10 times at least, before touching ink to paper.<br /><br />It is a perfect display of: James Gordon angst, Batman's thoughts going into superheroism, and a tragic dystopia called Gotham City.  This novel is so acclaimed mainly for these reasons.  Other reasons include: The amazing artwork(should be in an art museum if it isn't), and Frank Miller's fight scenes.  All artist drawing fists and kicks should take note from Millers fights.  I may be repeating what other people have said on the book's sleeve reviews, but I agree that Miller has an incredible take on action.  It is very refreshing for me.<br /><br />If you like the gritty Batman we have seen in recent films, BUY this novel.  It's really short, but it packs a dirty punch.  Miller will most likely remain the best Batman scribe in the business.

B00001OH7P|5.0|The mark of a great artist is to produce an album that consists of a set of tracks which together produce a whole that is much greater than any one or the sum of its parts. There are many great bands and many great albums, but this level of achievement is limited to only the masters. How many have achieved this? Few indeed, and let's name them: The Who ('Tommy'), Pink Floyd ('Dark side of the moon' & 'The Wall'), Santana ('Abraxas'), Rolling Stones ('Let it bleed' & 'Sticky Fingers'), Led Zeppelin 'II', Traffic 'Mr Fantasy'...and David Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust'. Now exquisitely remastered, can one afford to not have this album?
B00021R7CG|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The low budget nature of the TV film By Dawn's Early Light is sometimes painfully evident, but it has a number of masterful scenes (everything involving James Earl Jones and Jeffrey DeMunn) and is consistently interesting in its take on World War III: if you're into this kind of film it's well worth seeking out.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I like this movie so much, it's very funny, the Yzma character makes me laugh a lot throughout the movie not to mention when she turns into a cat at the end, also the emperor is very funny when he turns into a llama.

B000O59AFC|4.0|I always liked the first theatrical installment of Mission: Impossible with Tom Cruise.  However, now that I can view at home on my Blu-ray disc player and HDTV, it's even better!    I had previously purchased Mission: Impossible 3 (my favorite) on regular DVD.  But after seeing what the first one looked liked, I started thinking \\"I need to get number 3 on Blu-ray, too!\\"    The picture is astounding, along with the sound.  The detail crisp and clear.  You won't be disappointed.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Definitely worth watching.  The whole story is taken form the viewpoint of an eight-year-old German boy who simply, like any adventurous eight-year-old kid, doesn't know what's going on around him and why certain things are the way they are.    I like the approach to it.     Unfortunately, I couldn't appreciate the DVD as much as I wanted because my father annoyingly talked through the most intense parts of the movie, and finally, I had to tell him to keep quiet.      So if you are watching this movie, folks, please let the audience experience the film for themselves.  Don't explain the story away.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This was one of the few movies I went to the theater to see and could hardly wait for the DVD.  There is a wonderful story and insight into the mysterious continent and its' history and its' people.  Where does the time go when watching this fast moving and exciting film?  Brandon Walters, the Aboriginal little boy, is captivating. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are most believable in both their roughed and tender scenes.  And, speaking of scenes and scenery.  They simply do not come any better! There is such a span of themes and lives and locations that there is something for everyone.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|This is a great movie for adults as well as kids. I have seen it 5 times and always will watch again when my grandkids watch it. As soon as it starts we are glued to the screen. My only complaint is one song that could have been left out called, Do you want to be my lover. Enough said.
1600240003|3.0|I have only read (2) books by this author: Chasing the Dime and The Lincoln Lawyer (both enjoyable). I needed a short audio book for a trip so I selected The Overlook part of the Harry Bosch series.<br /><br />In this story Harry Bosch is called out on a case when a murder victim found at an overlook off Mulholland Drive. The victim is Dr. Stanley Kent who had access to radioactive materials stored at hospitals throughout LA. The clues point toward a terrorist plot, and Harry Bosch must deal with the in-fighting of the FBI and Homeland Security. Once again Bosch must work with Rachel Walling, who he had a previous fling with, and it appears the sparks still fly.<br /><br />The book takes place over a twelve hour period, and Harry as usual, makes his share of enemies during his investigation. A short book, with a few twists but not much character development, it did make my drive go by quickly though.

B00005B58Y|5.0|They say that one of Miles Davis' greatest skills as a jazz musician was his ability to piece together bands whose members not only had incredible talent, but who were also able to work together, develop as a unit, and bring more out of the music than any individuals could do on their own or in another band. Personally, I feel that this CD demonstrates that ability in the foremost, and together with Miles' inimitable playing and the selection of an exciting variety of original and standard tunes, it is hard to find many CDs comparable to this one. For me, an amateur jazz pianist, \\"Billy Boy\\", is the signature tune of this album and the epitome of Miles as an unequaled band leader. Why, he doesn't even play on the track! He can't add anything to Red Garland's razor-edged block chords, so he just lets the trio play. (I can't imagine a modern artist laying out on their own album.) Miles does it with a matter of fact attitude and serious panache. Of course, for the rest of the tracks that he does play on, he's vintage Miles. The title track, in particular, is determined and delightful, and Miles' take on the Monk tune \\"Straight, No Chaser\\" just puts another length or two between him and the rest of the jazz pack. Miles Davis was so prodigious, you really can't say this is his absolute best work, but for the sake of argument, I'll defend the honor of Milestones any day of the week. I think it is terrific.<br /><br />If you are interested in another, equally as good, version of \\"Billy Boy\\", try Ahmad Jamal's [[ASIN:B000006EJ4 Cross Country Tour: 1958-1961]]. His chord selection is very reminiscent of Garland's, but with a more delicate touch. It's pretty phenomenal.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I saw Casino Royale twice in theaters, I loved Danial Craig's performance as James Bond, and I also liked the song \\"You Know My Name\\". I noticed that the song was not on the soundtrack CD, but it was on Chris Cornell's CD CARRY ON.  I knew Chris from Soundgarden and Audioslave so when I bought the CD I was familiar with his music.  I remember watching those weird music videos with the dark images and hearing \\"Black Hole Sun\\" on the radio. Grunge Rock was usually very moody and dark. The singers were growling or yelling the lyrics and you could not understand what they were singing.  I mean really, could anybody understand the lyrics to Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"?<br />Soundgarden split in 1997 and Audioslave in 2007 so when I bought SCREAM I put those bands that he was in aside and listened only to Chris.  The music is wonderful!  The songs are a great mix of Rock, Funk, Soul and R&B which really shows his singing talents.  I do not think that fans knew the depth of Chris's singing when he was in Soundgarden and it is quite sad that they are unwilling to open their minds to his new music.  I enjoyed lisening to his songs from begining to end.  He has a very soulful voice that stays with you long after you have finished listening to the CD.  I strongly recommend SCREAM to any fan who loves Chris Cornell.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|I consider, 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead,' released in 1993, some of the best of Burke---and his character, Robicheaux. I had the opportunity to listen to the book, way back then, on tape.  Now this was not the 'usual' audio book.  It was complete with eerie sound effects and so expertly done, that my family camped out in the living room, turned out all the lights and we made an evening out of this extraordinary tale.<br /><br />While I don't believe this movie adaptation, 'In the Electric Mist, holds a candle to that first experience, it still provided a great visit, with characters that I came to love, over a decade and a half ago. It was this previous introduction that turned me on to Burke and destined me to become a loyal, forever fan.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I've always rather envisioned Robicheaux's character to look something like the dark, craggy, and grumpy, Kinky Friedman. And in real life, he rather does. However, if given a list of potential actors, I would have placed Tommy Lee Jones on the short list, for some of the same physical characteristics. I was able to completely identify him with the role, although I could have used a tad more accent.<br /><br />Robicheaux is an alcoholic, struggling to stay in remission, with many skeletons in his closet, including witnessing a black man being gunned down in the swamps, many years previously---something he chose to remain silent about.  He can no longer remain in denial, when a member of a filming crew working in the swamps, comes across the bones.  In the midst of this event, grizzly murders of prostitutes begin to take place---murders he would love to pin on his sleazy nemesis, the mobster, played by John Goodman.<br /><br />The character who plays Robicheaux's daughter, Alafair, provides some nail-biting moments toward the end of the movie, as well. To digress, I've always loved the way Burke's real daughter is named Alafair and the way he sets up such a bond between Alafair and Robicheaux, in all of his work. I find this sweet and endearing.<br /><br />As Robicheaux begins his investigations, he has hallucinogenic encounters with a troop of Confederate Soldiers, under the famous John Bell Hood. Hood becomes Robicheaux's ghostly sub-conscience, offering insights into seeking and finding truth---an all knowing wisdom, from the grave.<br /><br />The movie is not high on budget and in some respects, it looks almost like a made for TV drama.  However, they still managed to capture the mysterious Cajun atmosphere, making you feel you might just have to start swatting skeeters. I wish there had been more development of the supernatural aspects---the war, the soldiers.  In the book and audio version, this was hair-raisingly spooky, but not so much in this movie.<br /><br />There were a couple of superficial mentions of Katrina, bringing us more up to the moment with Louisiana, which felt a little out of place, because we were dealing with another place and time, with the original story.  Besides, Burke's 'The Tin Roof Blowdown,' is where he excels in describing his beloved New Orleans, post Katrina.<br /><br />I agree, you don't have to have read the book to enjoy this mystery/drama. There's plenty of suspense, reminders of the devastation of war, prejudice and corruption.  It's also contemplative, ensuring we can't run from our demons; that anesthesia through alcohol, won't extinguish the omission of truth, or responsibility.work. I find this sweet and endearing.

0061139378|4.0|Coraline tells the story of a young girl named Coraline, and the house that she lives in. Her parents, both working from home, don't have enough time to pay attention to her, and thus, she is prone to exploring. Upon discovering a mysterious door in their flat, she has her mother unlock it, revealing a brick wall behind.    But late at night, this door opens to a parallel world where her parents both have more than enough time to spend with her, she gets to eat delicious food, and her crazy neighbors are actually a bit more entertaining. Though, things aren't quite good in this other world. Everybody has buttons for eyes, which is a bit unsettling, and the other mother is just too sweet.    That, and the cat that followed her into the other world tells her that the other mother has more to her than meets the eye.    Returning to the real world, Coraline discovers that her parents are trapped in a mirror, and must return to the other world to try to save them (as well as the children who were trapped by the other mother previously). She and the cat return to face off against this world that suddenly got a whole lot more creepy.    Coraline is a creepy story; probably one of the more creepy tales written specifically for children. It's like a very dark, modern Alice in Wonderland.    This is a good story, and according to Gaiman, one that he's most proud of. And me, being a big fan of Gaiman's writing, can agree that this book is one to be proud of.    Though, I must also admit that I did enjoy the film better. This rare but possible occurrence has happened too with another film originally written by an author I like: Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club.    It's good, though, that a filmmaker is able to take an already enjoyable work and make it even more enjoyable. Though, the two are both still good works in their own right. Nevertheless, with the film being as good as it is, everybody wins.    Gaiman, it seems, though, has a penchant for \\"other worlds.\\" Neverwhere took usto the London Underground, Coraline to the Other World, Stardust to the Faerie Land, Sandman to Dream, and MirrorMask took us to City of Light/Land of Shadows (and MirrorMask, if Coraline is Alice in Wonderland, would be Through the Looking Glass). But when something works, it works.    Definitely worth a read if you like Gaiman, or even are a fan of Carroll's Alice. Additionally makes a wonderful gift for a young person, especially one that's not your own.

0375703764|5.0|Are you still sane? Do you still have a grasp, tenuous as it may be, on the fabrics of reality?    Then, seriously, man, you need to finish reading House of Leaves.    Some dead philosopher once said (was it Nietzsche?) that if you stare into the abyss long enough, it will soon stare into you. Well, if you read House of Leaves long enough, pretty soon, it'll start reading you. This can be either terrifying or awesome.    The book itself is written at three, maybe four levels. There's Navidson, who just bought a house somewhere in New England, where apparently, all manner of crazy stuff tends to happen. This time, though, it's not a shoggoth squatting in his basement. It's something different. Say, has that door always been there? Why is the house suddenly bigger on the inside than it is on the outside? That kind of different. So, he does what any rational, sane homeowner does: decides to investigate the strange labyrinth that's beyond this unfamiliar door.    On another level is Zampano, who is some blind cook of a shut-in reviewing the documentary \\"The Navidson Record,\\" which is the very same Navidson's account of what was beyond that doorway.    On yet another level is Johnny Truant, who discovers Zampano's scribblings, and comments on them as he reads them, and how they're affecting his life.    On yet another level is the editorial staff of House of Leaves, who provide translation and annotation where Truant, Zampano, or Navidson neglected to be clear.    So, nail down some measuring tapes, find a nice quiet (but not too quiet) place and read, read, read. You'll end up losing a lot in the process, one of these things being your sanity, but in the end you'll... well... you'll distrust the laws of geometry. So, maybe it's best that you not read it.    But you really should.

B00007KQA3|5.0|1984 is simply one of the best filmed adaptions of any novel.  This particular version filmed in 1984 works so well on so many levels that one is led from one scene to another in a manner that leaves one breathless even for those familiar with the book by George Orwell.  Let me begin with a rarely mentioned level of criticism--the quality of the film itself.  Though shot in color, director Michael Radford was careful to mute the colors such that what the audience sees seems more black and white, thus intensifying the crushingly grim reality of life in Oceania. London itself is presented as a city in disrepair, with cracked paint and corrosive rust ubiquitous.  And in the midst of this urban miasma is the protagonist Winston Smith (John Hurt), one who is Everyman for the 1980s.  There is absolutely nothing special about him. Even his last name reinforces his anonymity, though his first name implies a reaching out for that which is just beyond reach.  Smith works as a history re-writer, a job that well enables him to see up close one of the Party's most sacred rules: \\"Those who control the Present control the Past.  Those who control the Past control the Future.\\" He knows by rote these and similar rules, but to him they are verbal effluvium, phrases that do not touch his essence.  Everyone else in Oceania is similarly verbally constructed.<br /><br />Into his life enters Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), a sex-obsessed female who instinctively recognizes the nihilistic emptiness of English Socialism (Ingsoc). She seduces him, knowing all the while that in their common agreement that \\"They are the Dead,\\" and must suffer the inevitable fate of exposure by the Thought Police. O'Brien, supremely played by Richard Burton in his last role, seduces Winston psychologically, though in the book he confronts both.  In the film, he uses his softly modulated voice to seem the very pinnacle of reason, never more reasonable than in the torture scenes when he positions himself as Winston's pseudo-father figure who wants only to return Winston to a politically correct right reason.<br /><br />1984 in both book and film considers a host of issues that resonate as well today as back in the 1940s when first it hit print: what is an individual, how can we trust, what is common sense, and ultimately what is it that Winston refers to in Room 101 as that evanescent Spirit of Man that will triumph over brute dictatorship? When Orwell has O'Brien intone that man is infinitely malleable, he wanted O'Brien to suggest that man's spirit can be shaped and reshaped in any manner the interrogator wishes. But on some deep and buried level in Winston, Orwell also implies that this malleability need not be permanent.  If Winston and Julia could sin before their conversion, then it is only a matter of time before they relearn that their inner natures are truly malleable and that they can \\"snap back\\" with a sheer act of will.  The closing scene where Julia suggests that they must meet again is an ironic commentary on their ultimate ability to do just that no matter what viciousness O'Brien heaped on both of them.  1984 is a stark yet unforgettable punctuation that the Spirit of Man will live on after all.ther figure who wants only to return Winston to a politically correct right reason.       1984 in both book and film considers a host of issues that resonate as well today as back in the 1940s when first it hit print: what is an individual, how can we trust, what is common sense, and ultimately what is it that Winston refers to in Room 101 as that evanescent Spirit of Man that will triumph over brute dictatorship?

1439102813|4.0|The story is phenomenal.  This is a disease that needs more attention.  However, the writing left much to be desired. I felt detached from the characters.  It got better to the end but overall I would say this book was better in concept than execution.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The DS3 is a great controller.  Since PS3 only comes with 1, then waiting to grab a second on sale is a must.  Yes yes, it doesn't come with a cable.  But unless you don't have any already this really shouldn't be a big deal.  The controller itself is very ergonomically comfy.  It has a great wireless range and I've been impressed with the battery life.  It's a bit weird getting used to it as a DVD remote, but it beats buying a dedicated remote.  Far superior gaming controller to any out there right now.
B000F5EEU2|2.0|While their music is great my grandkids (pre-schoolers) didn't really get into the DVD.  If there were more animals, or kids enjoying the music (jumping or dancing around) it would have been more fun, but a lot of the DVD was just a \\"live concert\\" feel and didn't hold their attention.  Perhap grade school kids would do better with it.
B001TOD92C|5.0|It's been a long time since I heard an audience gasp -- and choke back sobs -- at a movie's end. But I heard it, and felt it, watching The Wrestler. The screen cuts to black, there's a pregnant pause, and then Bruce Springsteen's haunting song \\"The Wrestler\\" plays. Credits roll. And people leave the theater, stunned.    My wife and I saw the movie again yesterday. And I cried like a baby, again, the minute Springsteen started to sing.    Why? Two main reasons:    1. I felt for the protagonist, Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. I put myself in his shoes, saw the world through his eyes. I totally empathized with the man. In fact, Mickey Rourke played the character so sublimely, with such utter believability, that he WAS \\"Randy the Ram.\\" Because of that, what Randy felt, I felt. In effect, I became \\"Randy the Ram,\\" too.    Sometimes, when you watch a movie it's difficult (if not impossible) to suspend disbelief enough to forget that you're watching an actor play a role. With The Wrestler, I never once saw Mickey Rourke acting. I never once saw any of the actors acting. It was like watching a documentary with real people.    2. In many ways, The Wrestler is a metaphor for every person approaching middle age, when lives and careers wane, options fade, and a stifling feeling of desperation sets in. Randy's love interest in the movie, Cassidy -- played brilliantly by the incredibly talented Marisa Tomei -- felt it. Granted, too late to help Randy. But she felt it. She looked around at the patrons in the strip club and she knew what Randy felt every minute of his life -- in the end, time will beat us as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow.    Desperation can drive a person do things he/she wouldn't normally do, take actions that may seem foolhardy, react in ways that another day and time might temper. It's a difficult emotion to portray on screen because pushed too far, it becomes hysteria. Too little, and it merely wallows.     Reduced to its bare minimum, The Wrestler is a movieabout desperation and the toll that emotion takes on everyone involved. It is a movie about a genuinely nice guy who's down on his luck and has nothing left to live for except (a) memories of his glory days as a pro wrestler, and (b) one last chance to re-live those days.    I've read other reviews here, including a couple of them that condemn the movie's \\"profanity\\" or \\"violence.\\" To those people, I can only say that there's no more violence in The Wrestler than in the evening newspaper or on the 6 O'Clock news. And I've heard more profanity at a hockey game.    Whatever violence and profanity that occurs in The Wrestler is there because this is a gritty, real movie. There's nothing gratuitous in The Wrestler. Even the scenes in the strip club are real. Yes, you will see nudity. But not because it's a \\"steamy\\" Hollywood love scene; rather, because it's a strip club, where nudity occurs.    I'm going to see the movie again (for the third time!) this afternoon. I'm going to buy it the minute it's released next month. Although The Wrestler is sometimes painful to watch (one wrestling scene, in particular, makes me squirm), it is the most genuine, un-Hollywood movie I've seen in many years. Perhaps ever.    There's a line Randy speaks from time to time: \\"Bring it.\\" As in, bring it on. Give me your best.    The Wrestler brings it. No matter how many times I watch it -- in fact, the more times I watch it -- it never fails to bring it.    I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

It's been a winning year for Clint with this film and \\"Gran Torino\\", Eastwood again has established himself as a director of note. It's too bad that this film didn't get more Oscar nominations outside of Jolie's deserved turn as the mother of a kidnapped child.  From the start to finish, you'll be riveted by Eastwood's direction and Jolie's performance. One of the best movies of 2008.

Smart people keep talking about them and you feel like you need to know how to leverage Designs Patterns in your code.<br />If you have ever searched books on this topic you have probably come across this item:<br />[[ASIN:0201633612 Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)]]<br />It's an amazing work by the gang of four, but if you make that book your very first book on Designs Patterns and actually understand any of them, I will buy you dinner. Alas, that book is simply incomprehensible for most people having no prior exposure to this subject.<br />Head First Designs Patters is a whole different story. Comprehensibility is it's goal, the examples are based on real world situations that you and I encounter every day. Besides that the book will show you examples of uses of Designs Patterns in standard JAVA libraries. For example, chapter 3 breaks down the Decorator Pattern and then shows you how to write your own Decorator for the InputStream. Chapter 2 introduces the Observer Pattern and also shows you where to find applications of that Pattern in JDK.<br />Even if you fully understand each and every one of the patters in the book, but will never get to use them in real life for your code, you will still enjoy the design riddles this book presents. It will make you think in a fun way.<br />The book certainly assumes a level of JAVA expertise. You do need to know how to write JAVA code - no question about it.
B000P0TZK6|5.0|It is such a good movie, it has suspense and a nice twist to it. It kept you guessing and it kept me on the edge of my seat for sure. I love Johnny Depp too, he is such a fantastic actor, I really enjoyed his role in this movie. Timothy Hutton and John Turturro are both in the movie as well.
B001FB55Y4|4.0|I purchased this movie because I'm a fan of Gerard Butler. I own most his movies. I like Guy Ritchie's style in this movie. Loved Gerard Butler in it. Clever, different, love the twists in this movie or any movie. Hard to follow the story lines cutting back and forth but after several viewings I understood. I recommend this movie. The whole cast was very good in it. A fun, witty movie. Thankfully not formulaic with the plot. Something different and left wide open for a sequel. I hope it happens.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|When Lennon left and split The Beatles I felt the glorious and unmatchable sixties had come to an end and that I would never listen to great music again. I went nuts for some time, collecting butterflies and hunting ufos. I went through the 70's listening to The Who's masterpieces and the Rolling Stones less inspired albums. When the seventies were over I got some relief, left the ICU for a regular hospital room and came to life again as the eighties began and saw the renaissance of the British music. I still have that NME newspaper format edition with Boy George in the front cover and his early Madonna's colorful and number one look. Colour By Numbers is an album that reinvigorated music, gave colors to its monochromatic monotony, refreshed it and shone it anew. It is The Smiths with Morrissey and without Marrs but with three other talented guys you never hear so much of as in the case of the former Big Country who echoed Stuart Adamson's voice only. Colour By Numbers is perfect and has a landmark status. You can take five hit singles out of its ten tracks and the other five are not just fillers but thrillers. 1. Karma Chameleon is such a catchy and joyful song to make all fruitcakes release the chick they have inside. 2. It's A Miracle has a fantastic dance beat that takes you off the chair with your butts swinging east and west. 3. Black Money is a good Princesque ballad. 4. Changing Every Day is the boring Brazilian bossa nova turned into listenable music. 5. That's the Way is a masterpiece with Helen Terry and George singing in duet and destroying all artists who attempted to do the same before and after. 6. Church of the Poisoned Mind is la crème de la crème, the masterpiece of pop masterpieces. 7. Miss Me Blind is like It's A Miracle but with an astonishing Cocteau Twin-like solo by Roy Hay. 8. Mister Man again follows the paths of the previous track with an early Madonna beat. 9. Stormkeeper sounds much the same like the two previous tracks without being repetitive. 10. Victims is another good piano-driven ballad only without the duet with the amazing backing vocalist Helen Terry who also dresses tracks 3 and 6 wonderfully. Alceu Natali

All the pages are quality paper capable of coming very close to presenting the true tonality of these works.  In addition, the reproductions themselves are true to the toning of the originals.  Black and white photography is not just blacks and whites, and this book gets you very close to the feel of the originals.  If you have any interest in the history of photography and one of the earliest proponents of photography as art you just shouldn't pass up this book.

0375707972|4.0|I have to admit that I have not seen the movie, and I'm only mildly tempted by it. I did buy the book because of the buzz though, and it was a most absorbing reading. Although I actually do not find the ending convincing given the development of the characters, the novel does convey both the beauty and the strangeness of the relationship between the protagonists. The author has a subtle but ultimately convincing way of opening up the reader's mind to the possibility that horrible crimes are committed by perfectly normal, even somewhat innocent, people. The Kindle version is very well formatted.

0671646788|5.0|This book is pretty good.  I've been reading \\"Success\\" books for a long time and this book ties a lot of the same material together.  If you are not familiar with the \\"Success\\" book world, this is a great place to start.  I read it as a refresher and this was good for this too.  I do think this book should probably be in everyone's collection.  Topics include, listen to people, set an example, take time for yourself, and dress the part.  This book is also good if you are in a rut.  I didn't really learn anything new from this but I attribute this because I have read a lot of similar material.  There are many core principles in this book you cannot do without though so make sure you learn it somewhere.
B000002L75|5.0|This will be the fourth purchase of this ablum over a 20 year time frame.  I still have the lp vinyl, just wore out my 18 year old cd, and picked up the two disc cd/dvd version when I started to look for a replacement.  I couldn't find this single cd version in the store at the time I wanted it,  and really wanted the one disc version to replace the original CD I had to replace.  You'll learn all the words, and it is a good combination of young Depeche Mode and an introduction to older Depeche Mode. All though People Are People was the first song from this album I heard on WLIR on the radio years 20 years ago and ran out to get the ablum, over the years, my favorites have changed to Stories of Old as my favorite song on the album, with Lie to Me, Blasphemous Rumors and Master and Servant as my next favorites.  Get this one, you'll love it!    Something to Do-cute and catchy    Lie to Me-great  song     People Are People-meaningful, first song I hear from them on this albu    It's Doesn't Matter-slow and realistic     Stories of Old-my favorite on the album    Somebody-slow and senual    Master and Servant-very sexy. This song is perfect. After 20 years, I still listen to this song and laugh like the first time I heard it.     If You Want -catchy    Blasphemous Rumors-very sadistic and dark

B0011NVC98|3.0|This definitely not the early proto-English epic Beowulf that featured somewhere during the first couple of weeks of my \\"Intro to English Literature Part 1\\" course that I remember from yea these many years ago; the one that covered everything up to about the 18th Century. And it is not quite as risible as it appeared from the movie trailer - I mean, a daemonic Angelina Jolie,  starkers and rising from the depths of a subterranean pool and seducing Ray Winstone as he undoubtedly wishes he was? No, this is not what I remember from sophomore English Lit, but it's not half bad, considered on its own terms. Visually, this is as different a movie as just about anything recently produced for the big screen; it's what a video game, or a graphic novel would look like, if the producer only had an unlimited budget. And it does work, briskly paced and imaginatively staged - this may be the future of a certain sort of fantasy movie, generating an elaborate, consistent and richly detailed `look' and special effects from a computer program, rather than from matte paintings, painted cheesecloth and sculptured Styrofoam. It's not anything like this - but it will pass a Saturday evening as well as much else and probably better than most, especially of your household contains teenage males. Amazingly, Neil Gaiman had much to do with this, as a writer. This is the second film he has scripted that I have watched and reviewed lately and enjoyed- much  against initial expectations. If a coincidence, make of it what you will.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD disc - all about how that look was created and generated are almost more interesting than the movie itself, even if they do somewhat spoil the magic. How they did it, and looking at the bare set, the weird `motion capture' suit, and the wire-frame and weighted props - it's almost as fascinating as the movie itself, even  if it does strip away most of the magic.  It raises without meaning to, some uncomfortable questions for the producers of Hollywood epics in the next couple of decades. Namely; what use will producers have for impossibly perfect flesh-and-blood-top-of-the-food-chain actors, when you can take perfectly able but lesser and perhaps not so good-looking actor and with the click of a mouse make them look as good as you want and as fit as you need.ollywood epics in the next couple of decades.

B0000CDL93|5.0|Great movie.  I recommend to anyone with an interest in the JFK assassination.  Altbough some of the more abstract conspiracy theories will make you rub your head, there's no doubt that there were alot of mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, not the least of which was the arrest of Oswald and the defense he himself put forth the short time he was in custody.  In the end, I think anyone with an interest in history or JFK should take a gander at it.

B000058983|5.0|This album is essential to anyone that can get the hairs on their arms raised by merely listening to great music. Arthur Lee and band came up with a classic on this recording. If your music collection includes Forever Changes, The Doors first album, the first album by Spirit, Frank Zappa's Hot Rats, Canned Heat, L.A. surf music and some of the pop music that was being done in Los Angeles in the 60's, then you really don't need anything else. Not when it comes to variety, anyway. All of that talent, diversity of musical styles, personalities, all of it coming out of one city in one decade. It hasn't happened before and it won't happen ever again. The sad part is that the pretender bands that came out of L.A. in the 70's (Eagles, anyone?) reaped all of the profit that should have gone to the 60's bands that laid the groundwork. If you want to listen to real country-rock, don't bother with Eagles. Try Buffalo Springfield or the Byrds. You can't put Love in a category at all. There  is not a wrong note on Forever Changes. If you don't already own this stroke of genius, today is the day to change that forever. Buy it and wear it out. Arthur would appreciate that. RIP Arthur, you were the best.

0451528018|4.0|\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was my first expedition into the world of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, and I greatly enjoyed the experience. As I have no means of comparison, I am not sure whether the style of the novel is consistent or singular in terms of Sherlock Holmes novels and stories, but I was delighted by the narration provided by Dr. Watson. As a narrator, he was faithful and consistent, and Doyle skillfully manipulates the character to both gain the reader's confidence and sense of security, while keeping many important facts close to his chest. Holmes, on the other hand, was detestable. From his very first introduction I felt repulsed by the character. For that reason, I am glad that the narrator was Watson and not the infamous detective himself. In the end, he played a relatively minor role, and the novel itself is very enjoyable.
B0000026NC|4.0|This album is a mixed bag.  If you're looking for stellar live performances, you may prefer Pulse instead.  For example, Gilmour sounds dead tired (or just completely stoned) on Learning To Fly.  It makes me cringe and I skip over the song.  The version on Pulse is incredible in comparison.  But on the other hand, On The Turning Away is incredible here; and it's not included on Pulse.    Overall, Pulse is amazing throughout, and this album is amazing sometimes.
B001N26GHU|2.0|As the Boss himself has pointed out, his fans don't seem to like his \\"happy\\" records.  Personally, I loved \\"Human Touch,\\" but the reason most listeners prefer the Bruce who lives in the darkness on the edge of town to the Bruce who lives, say, in Lucky Town, is because when Springsteen gets happy, he gets scatterbrained.  Case in point: \\"Working on a Dream,\\" a collection of twelve pieces with stylistic diversity and ideas as thin as a record sleeve.  I love the Sixties pop stylings, from the Orbisonian opening of \\"This Life\\" to the Spector-esque swirl of \\"My Lucky Day.\\"  Beyond its sound, the album is enjoyable, fun, even, but hollow enough that I went back time after time searching for something more.  I found it only in \\"Life Itself\\" and the title tune from \\"The Wrestler,\\" tacked on as a bonus track; unsurprisingly, they're the two least-blissful pieces on the record.  I can dig a guy working on a dream, but I can only love a guy who's working on a dream because his soul demands it; on this album, I hear little soul and a whole lot of dreamy airiness.  Which doesn't make it a complete failure--just one of Springsteen's puniest efforts.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|The acting, the settings, the cinematography, the uncompromising editing (rejecting the familiar shot/reverse shot relay in favor of long takes), the spectacular scene of a fiery oil strike (recalling the air strike in \\"Apocalypse Now\\"), the nuanced richness of the film score, the tour-de-force performance of Day-Lewis (perhaps only Orson Welles' Kane compares) require that anyone who is the least bit serious about film make this experience a top priority.  But the end of this disturbing spectacle doesn't produce the catharsis of either a \\"Citizen Kane\\" (whose protagonist has at least an intimation of the truth, i.e. Rosebud) or an \\"Oedipus Rex\\" (whose protagonist not only eventually acquires self-knowledge but acts on it), and for that reason I'm withholding a star.<br /><br />But there's yet another reason to have some reservations.  Films that are ultimately the most powerful and enduring are those that put the verisimilitude of \\"everyday life\\" first and foremost, leaving the deeper allegorical implications to those who choose to pursue them.  At the half-way point, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" takes a surrealistic turn, and more than likely many spectators who have begun this lengthy film (with Lewis dominating every shot and scene save one) will tune out.  It's even more likely that most casual spectators will, at the end of this seemingly out-of-control scenario, simply breathe a sigh of relief that it's over and dismiss the whole business as wild and wacky, crazy stuff.<br /><br />Still, this is a viewing experience that can only strengthen its grip on reflective spectators.  Now that I've seen the film, it's become rooted in consciousness much like a Faulkner novel, in which a single character (named Compson or Sutpen) comes to represent an entire culture, from its idealistic, heroic and noble beginnings to its delusional and narcissistic, pathetic and decadent end (Faulkner's thunderous \\"Absalom! Absalom!\\" is the modern prototype).  You will see no blood in this film.  That would require a character capable of forgiving and being forgiven, of loving and being loved, of being not merely the sole god of his universe (who abandons his son, after denying that he's even begotten him) but the lamb, willing to sacrifice himself for others and able to function as a member of a human family whose bonds are not merely the artificial ones based on greed, radical individualism, and unrelenting competitiveness.  Instead, we are left with the certainty that the ambition and arrogance we have witnessed can only beget more needless destruction of human life.  In that sense, there indeed will be blood.<br /><br />Yes, the movie is especially relevant to our present political-economic situation (toward the end of the film a character makes reference to a bad \\"economy\\"--and the year is 1927, 2 years before 1929--or, if you prefer, 2009).  But it hits even deeper and closer to home than the culture surrounding us.  It doesn't require a lot of soul-searching to see the protagonist as a symbol, or magnified reflection, of one's own selfish journey in life.  The discovery is more than a little disturbing, exposing the wounds of ethnic pride, family insularity and, above all, the constant denial and prideful isolation practiced by the willful self.  Nonetheless, the film ultimately falls short of the balance between \\"pity and fear\\" that Aristotle required of great tragedy.  Daniel Day-Lewis's character is obviously fatally flawed if not hubris personified  (also part of the Aristotelian definition), and that's a pity of immense proportions--but no more.<br /><br />[Later: This is a film that continues to play itself out long after the final scene. It's occurred to me that there is, after all, a hint of redemptive blood-- not in the protagonist but his son.  The early shots of the child as a baby are sufficient proof to this viewer that Daniel Plainview is (despite his final disclaimer that he adopted the child merely as a sales gimmick) the boy's father.  The spectator's \\"reward,\\" or epiphany, occurs when, for a fractional moment at the end, we see the \\"deaf-mute\\" son respond to his father's voice.  That moment tells us that the son has deliberately chosen an indirect, defensive route of communicating with a non-communicative father, wisely (as it turns out) hedging his bets should the father prove adamant and unyielding in his bloodless inhumanity.  The son, not the father, has seen to the completion of the \\"Abraham-Isaac\\" story, an archetypal drama that offers hope for a future in which  the son, rather than repeat the sins of the father, acquires an identity of his own.]d,\\" or epiphany, occurs when, for a fractional moment at the end, we see the \\"deaf-mute\\" son respond to his father's voice.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Imagine if every time you opened your mouth, you almost always made the funniest, cleverist, snarkiest possible comment.  Now imagine if your parents and many of the people around you are also the same way.  That's what life is like for pregnant teenager, Juno played by Ellen Page.  In fact, it's strange to see Page interviewed and not coming up with snarky comments and one liners.      I enjoyed every moment of this movie, not just for the award-winning screenplay, but for the interesting and realistic plot, good acting, chemistry between the characters (for example, even when Juno's parents are angry or frustrated with her, you can tell they still love her), and kind tender treatment of a delicate issue (pregnancy and options surrounding it).    I highly recommended this movie to my friend and high-ranked Amazon Reviewer, Dennis Littrell.  He's a bit of a culture snob who only likes \\"films\\" not \\"movies.\\"  He thought the movie would be rather juvenile and refused to watch it until I told him it won best screenplay.  He absolutely loved the movie too, and says it's a \\"film,\\" not a \\"movie!\\"  He says, \\"Just a brilliant script, the kind of script that makes other writers green with envy...Ellen Page is excellent as Juno, and does she have some great lines to deliver.  I also liked Allison Janney who played Juno's stepmom, Brenda, and Jennifer Garner as Vanessa.  The movie is a full Kleenex box for sure, yet there is nothing phony about it, and there is no political position taken on abortion...\\"    I don't think this movie is over-rated at all.  If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you ignore the one-star reviews and give it a try.

B00004S8X5|5.0|The debut by Kylie Minogue is simply her best work of music. Back in 1988, I purchased her cassette single, \\"I should be so lucky\\". The euro pop beats from the acclaimed producers who wrote for Bananarama and Rick Astley were thee gods of late 1980's.   Kylie's voice was clear and crisp. I had no clue she was a television star in Australia. An added bonus for trivia. Listening to this release as cd format brings back the craziness of my teen years: my first job, adventures staying out late without calling my mother etc... Brilliant!
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Great movie except the ending of the last action scene was a total let-down.  The last action battle totally ramps you up to where you want to see how he does against multiple targets... and the screenwriter just robs you of the climax.  You're left with a total letdown feeling.  Then the ending scene is fine but it just doesn't make up for the \\"being robbed\\" portion.  Overall, a great movie and still worth buying for the rest of it.
B001PR0XYA|5.0|The plot of this movie has been well described. I guess my liking it is a matter of taste. It doesn't try to be anything profound, but the attention to science fictional detail won me over. In fact I was sold on it in the first five minutes when we see Kainen has to be taught Norse by a dangerous and painful machine learning technique - imagine that, a universe where everyone does **not** speak American English!!! Apart from that you have brave hero, spunky heroine, 'orrible monster (excellent CGI) and reasonably non-insulting picture of Viking society. Hell, 5 out of 5.

Apple must have access to the master, so my advice is to wait until they decide to issue this one themselves, maybe with bonus footage (are you listening, Apple...?)
B00000099Y|5.0|I'm going to level with the reader here:  I hope I don't dissuade you from buying this album, but I feel that \\"Lateralus\\" has thus far proven to be Tool's magnum opus despite the commercial, critical, and cultural success of this album.  I'm trying to be more conservative with 5 star ratings as of late simply so I don't look like a fanboy whenever I write an album review.    But after considering those three points (being the commercial, critical, and cultural success of this album), I had to give it 5 stars.      Now, album sales really don't indicate anything because today's platinum artist could be tomorrows has-been.  Critical success really doesn't mean much either because there's the abundance of favorable reviews directed towards bands who's only qualification of getting a good review is that they fit into the publication's target demographic.  But to see how this album influenced fans and peers alike shows that the group did something right with regards to releasing this endeavor.      When the album came out, most of their contemporaries from the grunge era were fading fast and the ones left remaining didn't have nearly any of the intensity that the band demonstrated on this album.  This left them from being considered one of grunge's more eccentric groups to being labeled as the new face of mainstream progressive metal.  As such, the band proved to be a hot commodity and generated two videos (Stinkfist and Aenema), two radio singles (46 & 2 and H), and another song that still found radio play on hard rock/metal stations (Eulogy).  There was a double-edged sword that came about with their rise to fame.  On one hand, true music fans and some innovative acts were able to take great influence and delight from the work composed here.  On the other hand, you had too many rock-oriented bands who were so desperate for attention and success that they were trying to emulate either Tool's style to the point of ripping it off or their production in hoping to achieve the capture the same elements found in Tool's works (David Bottrill didn't work with any metal acts prior to his involvement with Tool; that has since changed.)      Nevertheless, this is still one of those \\"landmark\\" albums that is deserving of everything positive said about it (people can hate it if they want, but the longevity of this album and the band itself isn't coincidental, so don't hate on it just because you don't get it.)  I've owned three copies of this album before saving it to digital format.  You don't need to do all that, but I still recommend picking it up if you haven't yet already.

B000059H98|5.0|I love, love, love this movie!!! Lori Petty, Malcolm McDowell, Ice-T, and all staying true to the comic book/graphic novel nature of the original Tank Girl I fell in love with in junior high. Post-apocalyptic rebels vs the evil establishment, and catch phrases you'll quote for years!
B000FBFMIO|4.0|I bought this book after reading many good reviews on it and the author. It was no disappointment. Well written and well developed. Even though I had not started with the first three books I quickly was swept into the story. I have but one negative point on it: At the beginning the story the sexual encounter was not needed. It was evedent of there relationship before what was described though I thank the author for not diving more into the scene. Besides that I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoyed letting a new world unwind around them becoming engrossed in the life of this unlikely hero.

0307269752|5.0|One of the best written Mystery Novels I have read this year. As always with the good ones ...I did not want it to end.  To bad this author was so short lived. I'm sure he would have entertained us for years.

B001LL9YN6|4.0|I remember when the film came out.  The big deal that was made about it.    I caught it on pay cable TV.  I liked it.    Music is the best part of course.   The Oscar winning song  & the other hit songs from it.    With the DVD it is good to FINALLY see the film widescreen.    STILL TO THIS DAY THE EDITING  BETWEEN JENNIFER BEALS & Marine Jahan   WHO DID THE DANCING IS A PUT OFF.  Why?  The wigs.  Simple.  The far away shots of Alex dancing when it is when you can tell that was NOT Jennifer by the bad wigs.    The 80's package.  A LOT OF PROBLEMS.  1.  THESE HORRIBLE LITTLE FLIP OPEN DVD PLASTIC CASE  2.  NO EXTRAS AT ALL, NO MAKING OF OR ANYTHING  3.  The 80's DVD package here comes with a CD with it.  SO, YOU WOULD EXPECT SONGS FROM THE FILM, REMEMBERING OF COURSE AN OSCAR WINNING SONG & SEVERAL HITS.  NOPE, 4 songs NOT related to the film.    Small part with Cynthia Rhodes who had the larger part in Dirty Dancing.  And, character actress  Micole Mercurio who also appeared in While You Were Sleeping & The Client & Robert Wuhl from Batman,  Bull Durham & Cobb.    Buy this edition ONLY if you are a fan of the film & DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE FILM.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Woody Allen has produced an excellent film for thinking adults in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I say this because he is able to capture much of the paradox of relationships as two young women in their 20s begin to explore what they want from life and from their relationships.    The character of Vicky, played wonderfully by Rebecca Hall, is a young woman who plays it safe most of the time. However a short and unexpected fling with artist Juan Antonio, played by Javier Bardem, opens up emotional doors for her that she can't close with her rational mind. Vicky and her good friend Cristina are staying at the home of Vicki's family friends, where Vicky accidentally sees the wife in the embrace of her Spanish lover. Patricia Clarkson plays the middle aged woman who tries to explain to Vicky why she has taken a lover and then begins to take the role of advisor to Vicky so that Vicky doesn't make the same mistake of marriage for stability rather than passion.    Cristina on the other hand moves in with the artist and his mentally unstable wife, Maria Elena, played by Penelope Cruz.  Despite all the freedom, drama and sex, in the end Cristina sadly learns that they are a highly dependent couple, passionate about each other, but so unstable that they can not maintain a solid relationships.     In the end we might expect Vicky to learn from her experiences with Juan Antonio and drop her wealthy privileged boyfriend, Doug. Or we might expect Cristina to learn some lessons about dependency and stability from living in a 3-way relationship with Juan Antonio and Maria Elena. But this is a Woody Allen film and behind the wry humor Woody is a wise philosopher. For in the end we can only learn from our own mistakes and unfortunately we often have to make the same mistakes repeatedly before our foolish hearts get a clue.     This is excellent film making. The film is warm and sunny and often shot outdoors, exploring the Catalan landscape. The architecture of Gaudi pops up here and therein scenes in Parc Guell or Sagrada Familia.     All the actors were in top form with Rebecca Hall emerging to the top with a subtle performance of a naive and insecure young woman playing the role of a determined and stable woman. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as the risk taking young woman who gradually understands that she is the third party to a highly dynamic mutually dependent relationship which really holds no future for her. Javier Bardem is very good as an intelligent, intuitive, man who finds he can't live in peace with his soul mate. Penelope Cruz is superb as a volatile dramatic creative woman who struggles against her own dependency needs. Last of all, Patricia Clarkson is excellent as the older woman who has been there and done that and now wishes that others would not make the same mistakes.
0060594896|5.0|Great book written by a very insightful author.  I highly recommend this for anyone that might be searching for a way to establish goals and see them through.
1416550534|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in quite awhile.  And I'm an avid reader.<br />All of the characters were finely drawn, but Grace was extra special.  It was obvious that the author did some major research because the story is so authentic to the time period and the setting.<br />Morton's prose flows along and what really impressed me was how she effortlessly wove the past and the present into her story.<br />Toward the end, I found myself reading slower because I simply didn't want the story to end.  But even the ending was a satisfying finish and I agree with another commenter here....this one was definitely a keeper! Not only a keeper, but it will make a wonderful gift for so many of my friends. Certainly not my copy, but others that I'll purchase.<br />Now I'm really looking forward to Morton's next release here in the US(She's an Australian author) The Forgotten Garden, due out in May and I've already pre-ordered it.
0140135154|1.0|What a farce! As a photography instructor, just a quick glance through this book shows me the author either did too many drugs in the 60s or was overdosed by 70's Soviet propaganda or both.  It teaches nothing concerning \\"seeing\\" except seeing through anti-capitalistic eyes--the same system that provides for crazy art and fortunately keeps the good quality art floating to the top like cream on milk.  I was amazed that after the first couple of incoherent chapters, the samples are almost entirely comprised of seductive naked women. I think the author would revel in the artistic freedom now available now on [...]  This book teaches nothing concerning seeing, art or aesthetics. My copy goes in the trash. Why do people praise this work. It reminds me of the writings of Timothy Leary, who was irrelevant then and always.
B001P5Q6F2|4.0|While Ashes of the Wake remains my favorite LoG album to date, Wrath holds it's own.  It may be my new second favorite, displacing Sacrament.  It begins with an instrumental track that starts with acoustic guitar and morphs into a light groove of metal goodness.  The second track hits hard and is more what you might expect from LoG.  The rest of the album is basically typical LoG with a bit more variety.  The last track is a pleasant surprise.  The deluxe edition includes a second CD containing separate MP3 tracks for guitar, bass, drums, and vocals for each song so you can experiment with re-mixing.  Very cool.  Highly recommended new album (2009).
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Please, for any fan of the true Bond legacy that wants future Bond movies to stop trying to copy Bourne but to return to the great Bond (renewed) that it was and still can be, please do not buy this DVD. Only $$$$ (or lack of) talks to movie producers. If you buy this DVD then they have no reason to change and I fear Bond 23 will be even worse than QoS. As a Bond fan I was so disappointed in QoS (a Bond plot about saving the water in Chile? are you serious? Think about that) and it will be a sad day if Bond 'jumps the shark'. Now is the time to vote with your purchasing dollars - don't buy QoS DVD! Send a message that the movie producers and writers can do better!

B0001ZX0OW|2.0|The review below was posted by another user, but sums up my feelings toward this film exactly.    I found this film mildly gripping until the last act, and then I was sickened. Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss. There is never really any doubt (at least for the audience) of Dave Boyle's innocence of the murder of Jimmy Marcus's daughter, yet Marcus' thuggish character over-rides any such concerns. Marcus coerces a \\"confession\\" from Boyle after telling him he will let him live, and then once Marcus' pre-conceived notion is thus confirmed, he kills Boyle anyways. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) shows up just in time to tell Marcus that he has killed an innocent man, and Marcus' reaction can be summed as a \\"so what.\\" The end of the film doesn't ask any gray moral or ethical questions--quite the contrary. Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served--the daughter was an innocent, Boyle was innocent, and they're both dead. It all \\"evens out\\" in some warped way. The pathetic Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) the only person who apparently cared if Boyle lived or died, is left unnoticed and marginalized. The last ten minutes of the film, thus, makes what transpired before filmmaking mendacity.   What exactly was the message Clint Eastwood was trying to convey here? The only one that makes sense to me is Dirty Harry-type vigilantism where colateral damage is a fact of life is acceptible under certain situations. I, frankly, find such reasoning appalling.
B001MYIQFE|1.0|Whether or not this release represents \\"the best sounding music you can buy, period!\\" is a purely subjective call.  However, some facts are as follows:  1.  There are documented defects with this disc including errors with the HDCD encoding and extended gaps between tracks that do not exist on prior issues of Heartbeat City.  Steve Hoffman implies these gaps were always the intention of The Cars and Mutt Lange and the segues were added after the fact.  There is ample evidence to suggest that this is not the case.  2.  This \\"Kensei Audio Transposer\\" that Audio Fidelity touts DOES NOT EXIST anywhere outside of being mentioned in promotional materials for Audio Fidelity.  People who ask about this device on Steve Hoffman's own forum are subject to having their posts deleted and are subsequently banned from the forum.  It seems to me that the more impressive they try to make the name of something, the more likely it is to be snake oil, particularly when it comes to audio.    I would advise anyone in the market for Heartbeat City to sidestep this mess and get the standard issue CD.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was never really interested in anime but decieded to watch this after seeing the high ratings it got, and I absolutely loved it. I have seen it three times now and it is definately one of the best movies I have seen.

0307269752|5.0|The girl with the dragon tattoo refers to Lisbeth Salander, a freelance investigator for a security firm.  She is different than the usual PI if you are used to Sharon McCone or Kinsey Millhone.  She could best be described as an antisocial goth.  She gets results and that is what counts.  Her work gets her involved with investigative reporter and magazine editor Mikael Blomkvist.  She is also known as Wasp among an international group of hackers with special talents, some of whom you will meet along the way.<br /><br />There are really two cases, one involving family secrets among a prominant industrialist family, and the other involving a rogue industrialist who is clashing with Blomkvist.  There are some sordid details along the way, and Salander can be quite tough in spite of being a shade under 5 feet tall and weighing 90 pounds (but wildcats are also small).<br /><br />The author passed away in 2004, and the novel was recently translated.  It is a well written worthwhile read if you like complex mysteries involving PIs and such.
B0013816GK|5.0|Why are there four different recordings of Verdi's Missa da Requiem by Carlo Maria Giulini currently listed through Amazon.com? (I counted them. Four!) They are not there because the work is, as we know, well loved. Rather, there has never been a Verdi master in my time so skilled at presenting the Missa at once as the beautiful, powerful, and spiritual communication it is. Giulini dominated many interpretations of Verdi's music during the last half of the 20th century as few could. He was respected for his artistry, the balance between feeling and power in presenting Verdi's music, and because he knew the difference between speed and musical velocity.      Enough praise for the Great One! However, personally I miss him so much. The beauty he brought from everything he touched was a constant sunrise, and he never called attention to himself. He was a baton poet.     This Requiem from Berlin is different from all the others I have heard by Giulini (I have three of his.). It is more beautiful, the sound is better, the soloists (duets, quartets too) sing rapturously, the choir is very good, and the orchestra is so very great. With such masterful direction and this great orchestra's playing, it makes me sorry to say \\"Ich bin nicht ein Berliner!\\" I have loved the way the BPO played for Giulini in Mahler's Das Lied, Beethoven's 9th, and now the Verdi Missa da Requiem.     This performance is the recorded swan song for the Missa da Requiem of one of the most luminous Verdi masters to ever touch the ground. Listen to it and you will soar. Get it as fast as you can.     Personally I am always torn between Brahm's German Requiem and Verdi's Missa for my favorite piece of music. Although I love many great compositions, right now my favorite between the two mentioned is Giulini's great performance of Verdi's Missa da Requiem with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and the Ernst Senff Choir and many great soloists. It is very rich and, and at my age of 68, I think I shall not hear too many performances more beautiful than this one. Ah, but after having heard it, I say to myself, \\"This one is enough.\\"
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Short and sweet...the movie wasn't made to win any awards.  But if you're looking for a \\"no-brainer\\" with some great \\"one-liners\\" and a few cheap, dirty laughs, then this movie is one to watch over and over again.  At the very least, you got to love the fact \\"Scotty Doesn't Know\\" is played throughout the entire movie!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The moment I stepped out of the theatre when I first saw this movie, it became my favorite. It still is. It's just gorgeous in every sense. The acting, the look, the feel, the story, it's all beautiful. And the story behind the movie is amazing as well. Most of the acting in the hospital is improv (that's why it's so natural!), it was filmed in 18 countries (24 locations, I think), and if you watch the bonus features, there's a little bit where they show that the director had everyone on the set convinced that Lee Pace was actually paraplegic. It's just an amazing story. You should see it at least once.
B001Q1QF2O|4.0|Lily's new album is alot different from the first. Her lyrics are still sarcastic and funny-but she has stepped out her box with making a song like \\"Him\\" which is a updated version of \\"what if god was one of us\\". This album is more electro pop then the first-but it is still a great album. I recommend it to anyone

0316017922|5.0|I've read (or listened to) all three of Malcolm Gladwell's books.  'Outliers' is now my clear favorite, though I must admit that I was especially taken by the author's impassioned narration.  If you can, I strongly recommend the unabridged audio tape version.  Gladwell's true passion for these subjects shines through the recording.  Listening to him was an enriching, enjoyable experience.  The audio version also features a nice extensive interview with him on the final CD.<br /><br />Gladwell makes a strong case for his premise - the conventional wisdom is that an outlier is some innately talented person.  In fact, outliers spring from a combination of cultural legacies, strokes of luck and fancy, and heaps of hard, purposeful work.  By using cultural touchstones like Bill Gates, Bill Joy and the Beatles, the author provides stories that resonate.  Bill Gates fully admits \\"I was lucky\\" - through a sequence of extraordinary events, he gets full access to a timeshare computer in 1969 at the age of 13.  He then puts in tens of thousands of hours in perfecting his computing skills.  At that time, he was undoubtedly the only person in the world at that age to be in that position.<br /><br />Likewise, Gladwell impresses upon us the significance of The Beatles teenage sojourns to Hamburg.  Forced to play eight-hour gigs, they logged thousands of hours of practice and built up a huge repertoire of  songs.  This was the cauldron that forged the band that changed the face of music forever.  Hamburg was, in retrospect, an extreme stroke of fortune.<br /><br />The author's epilogue shows that this is a deeply personal book.  The author details the story of his mother, at first telling her story very matter-of-factly, then retelling and making note of the sequence of events that were initiated three and four generations before and provided her with the opportunities to give her a very different life than one could have imagined at the outset.
B001TODCII|4.0|Liam is not the first actor you would think of when you hear 'action movie', which is a good thing if you're like me and tune out when you see the typical tough guy 'vin diesel' type actors.<br />The movie is believable and doesn't rely on plot twist, the ending is straight forward and you see it from a mile away.<br />Basically, this movie makes you hate the bad guys a whole lot and then Liam comes along and does fantastically violent things to them.<br />I liked it!
1847242537|1.0|I admit it, I am out-of-step with current, popular taste, because I seem to be the one man on earth who thinks that the international bestseller  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a lousy book. I'm not even sure why I finished reading it. Sonny Mehta, the book's U.S. publisher at Knopf, calls it \\"deeply ambitious, insightful and fiercely smart,\\" and I am here to tell you it is none of those things.<br /><br />The book is two-thirds exposition... we're talking hundreds and hundreds of pages of numbingly dull backstory that brackets the one third in the middle where something actually happens. Unfortunately, what happens isn't ambitious, insightful, fiercely smart or even mildly interesting. And it's all written with cliche-ridden prose that is so bad that it's distracting. (that may be the fault of the translator, Reg Keeland, and not the original, Swedish author, Stieg Larsson). Here are some examples:<br /><br />\\"I think you are grasping at straws going to Hedestad.\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"Ricky, that story is dead as a doornail.\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"You didn't have to be a rocket scientist to see that these events were somehow related. There had to be a skeleton in one of their cupboards.\\"<br /><br />These are just three examples out of hundreds. And there are also a lot of clumsy descriptions, like this one:<br /><br />\\"She looked like an ageing vampire -- still strikingly beautiful but venomous as a snake.\\"<br /><br />So is she a vampire or a snake?  Are vampires venomous? And there are even clunkier sentences, like this one:<br /><br />\\"Harald Vanger had gone back to his cave by the time Blomkvist came out. When he turned the corner, he found someone quite else sitting on the porch of the cottage.\\"<br /><br />Someone quite else?? Either Larsson was a very bad writer or the translator's grasp of English isn't so good. It certainly doesn't strike me as \\"fiercely smart.\\"<br /><br />The title of the book is misleading, too, since it refers to the hero's sidekick and not the actual central character, who is a one-dimensionally valiant reporter for a financial magazine who is irresistible to women. If the women that he meets don't bed him immediately and fall madly in love with him, it's clear that they desperately want to.  Virtually all the men in the tale are sadists and all the women in the story have been sexually brutalized, willingly or unwillingly (it's mentioned in an aside that the reporter and his business partner/lover dabbled in S&M and bondage for fun years ago). Maybe that's why the original title of the book in Sweden was MEN WHO HATE WOMEN. I'm not kidding, that was the title.<br /><br />It all adds up to a book that's heavy on dull exposition, glorifies rape & torture while pretending to disapprove, and is written in unbearably flat, cliche-ridden prose. I can't find a single positive thing to say about the book except that the galley was well-bound and is no longer taking up space on my bookshelf.who is irresistible to women.

0307269191|4.0|As someone who relies on running a means of revitalization and stress relief to counterbalance my demanding legal profession, and as an amateur novelist myself, I found much to relate to in this novelist's honest memoir of his running/writing life.  I've always enjoyed memoirs like Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" that offer a glimpse into the forces that enable writers to succeed.  But what makes this one unique is that the focus is more on the author's running life than his writing life.<br /><br />Murakami makes a compelling case that daily training in preparation for competition has a purifying and empowering value in its own right, regardless of whether you finish in the front, middle or back of the pack.  The reward is in the sacrifice itself and in the satisfaction that you're extracting the best possible performance from yourself.  His observations on the impact of aging on performance, as well as the exhilarating and agonizing sensations experienced during marathons, triathlons, and ultras, while somewhat disjointed, are always touching and inspirational.  After getting to know Mr. Murakami as a runner and enjoying his clear humble voice, I'm now eager to explore some of the novels he's written.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|It has been many, many years since I watched Disney's PINOCCHIO.  Today, my husband, 3 ½ year old daughter, and I sat down to watch the 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition, and we couldn't have been more delighted.  The story of PINOCCHIO is timeless, and this anniversary addition could not have been lovelier.<br /><br />PINOCCHIO is the perennial tale of the wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy.  To become a real boy, the Blue Fairy tells Pinocchio he must prove himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish.  He has lots of bumps and misadventures along the way, but in the end, with the help of his conscious, Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's wish comes true.<br /><br />My wee one was absolutely entranced by PINOCCHIO; her eyes were riveted to the screen.  She was completely absorbed in the story.  I have to admit, her daddy and I were, too.  Disney did an outstanding job on this restoration.  The colors are luminous, vivid, and awe-inspiring.  The music, well, the music brings a tear to your eye as you remember the words and melodies.  Songs include the classic \\"When You Wish Upon A Star,\\" \\"I've Got No Strings,\\" \\"Give A Little Whistle,\\" \\"Hi-diddle-dee (An Actor's Life For Me),\\" to name a few.  The sound is beautifully remastered, and every note is pure.  And Jiminy Cricket's voice will fill your heart.<br /><br />It is interesting to discover after not seeing this movie for over 30 years, that the myth of PINOCCHIO has become greater than the sum of its parts.  For example, as we all know, PINOCCHIO's nose grows longer and longer each time he tells a lie.  This is perhaps the quintessential lesson of PINOCCHIO.  But this event is on small part of one single scene, yet it is everyone's greatest memory of this movie.<br /><br />As another note, all of the voice acting is uncredited in this film, including Mel Blanc and Cliff Edwards, who went on to voice Jiminy Cricket for many, many years.<br /><br />I am so glad it I was able to share this movie with my child.  It was a wonderful, lazy family afternoon.  PINOCCHIO is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED..  PINOCCHIO is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

For all of Dexters wierd intricacies, he draws you in and you actually find yourself feeling sorry for the guy after a while. This is a cold reminder of some of the weirdos that may be in one's  midst on a daily basis without them even realizing it. Although fictional ,it is wildy entertaining. Michael C.

0061537934|5.0|This book will always have a special place in my heart.  I picked it out of a local public library's stacks for some reason unknown to me at the time.  Several years earlier my wife, a librarian, had brought it home for me to read.      I didn't then, but picking it up when I did was very enjoyable, even a slightly life-altering event.    Mr. Stein, perhaps a nice Jewish boy who is apparently smitten with Buddhism, tells a memorable tale celebrating...gentleness.  (I happen to respect this ethical belief system, I hesitate to call it a religion in the strict sense, esp. its teaching to reduce expectations to avoid the dreaded feelings of disappointment.)    Also, the decline of the dog hit home, when my beloved golden retriever died just several days after I read it.    I could have done without the overly pat and emotional ending.  It nearly made my review go down to four stars.  But karma exists I think.  And it's now my belief that animals have souls, after I spent years teaching Catholic religious education that that's not the case.
B000V86OKG|3.0|I bought season's one and two on here, based on the good reviews and the fact that I typically enjoy vigilante stories. Despite the reviews this is not a 5 star show, although I mostly enjoyed it none the less.   I like the overall concept and idea of the show, but sometimes it feels like a like 70's or 80's sitcom or a soap opera.   The special effects aren't that impressive to me, as the blood and bodies often aren't as convincing as they should be.  The acting is not great for most of the characters and the dialogue is too often painfully cheesy or bad. I feel like I'm watching a show about high schoolers, rather then police officers. I don't mind it necessarily, but nudity and in particular foul language, often feel tacked on or forced into the scene, because I guess they feel, hey this is on Showtime, so why not.  The police procedures, and behavior in the show is lacking sometimes in realism, but I'm guessing many viewers don't realize that.   Also, the ease with which Dexter obtains his victims and does his setup and procedures, all without ever getting witnessed or caught, is a bit of a stretch.   All that said, this is an enjoyable show if you like a dark drama. Dexter is a serial killer vigilante, in the truest sense. Unlike most vigilantes, he kills for the fun of it, and the vigilante angle, is part of a warped code instilled in him by his police officer father, to vent his perversions into a more productive outlet. Dexter is a sick man, with severe emotional deficiencies, though for the most part he hides it well.  I enjoyed season 2 more then season 1. The packaging is decent for both. I hear season 3, which I haven't seen yet, gets to be even more of a soap opera, which may not be a good thing. I do appreciate the internal drama and narrative of Dexter, and the fact that it focuses on his difficulties with normal life and not just the killing, but some episodes are too slow and get boring.
B000X12QQ2|5.0|Without a doubt this is one of the best LP's to be released in the 60's. I always felt the Zombies were given a bad rap by the public and their record company..This album should have sold as many copies as Sgt. Pepper's,Pet Sounds,Piper at the Gates etc. combined..the harmonies were angelic,the music compelling, this is a genuine masterpiece and utterly astonishing in the fact that the Zombies recorded it with their own money lacking the studio backing the Beatles and Pink Floyd had..The Zombies couldn't afford to be in the studio for days practicing their material so they already had it down before going in to Abbey Road, yes that is where they recorded this,renting the studio in 3 hour session blocks using the same equipment the Beatles and Floyd did, and also enlisting  Beatle engineer Geoff Emerick's  aid in recording \\"Time of the Season\\".They have said they were like \\"kids in a candy store\\", taking advantage of the 8-track mixing that the Beatles used for Sgt. Pepper. If anyone thinks this is a Pepper rip-off,the songs were already written and fleshed out before Pepper came out..like any transcendent group the Zombies had their own vision and were right in step with the times..I would say that this LP has aged better than Sgt. Pepper,  with cult status credibility this LP has stood the test of time, it could have been made today. This was a lovingly crafted work and many musicians and bands cite this as a major influence..this is music to be admired like a Van Gough painting, it only gets better with age. To think the group broke up right after this because of no support from the company, it took two years to be released in America, garnering a hit with \\"Time of the Season\\" in February 69..Many thanks to  Al Kooper( Blood Sweat and Tears, Bob Dylan ), who was also a talent scout who demanded Columbia to put this out..This 40th anniversay re-issue is lovingly reproduced in a 2CD package..One in glorious mono w/xtra tracks,and the other in stereo..I prefer the mono but it's great to have both. BUY THIS NOW!!!!!

B001E5FYS8|4.0|This documentary shows Philippe Petit's life-long commentment as an artiistic performer, not as an entertainer.  He clarifies his commitment is to art and does not intend to frighten an audience.  His famous walk was highly dependent on the commitment and efforts of friends and their efforts are an integral part of the story.  I found myself admiring him without any desire to be like him.  He reveals a side of human nature one rarely touches.  The extra features are also well worth watching.  I'm glad I bought it, rather than waiting for the movie to show up in our city.  A strong theme throughout the story is our fascination with breaking the law (convention) while doing nothing to harm anyone; I think this speaks to a deep longing within us, especially men.

B000FJGWBC|4.0|This movie has a pretty interesting plot and awesome UW photography.  I've dived a lot of the same area in the Bahamas--even with the sharks, and I think this Blu-ray version has got to be the sharpest UW photography I've ever seen. It's like I'm actually there diving.  If you want a fun story and stunning scenery, this is a great movie to have in your collection.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I have all of Chris Cornell's work, with or without a band, and I was a little wary of this new effort. I did not much like the first single \\"Ground Zero\\" but I gave the album a chance because of the respect I have for the artist.    And I must say that I was not disappointed. My trust in Cornell and my belief that he is incapable of making an album that does not at least have a few good songs were both rewarded with this effort.     It may take a listen through or two to get used to it, but once you do and are willing to give it a shot I think many people will find songs to like. Personally, I know I shall be listening to stand out tracks such as \\"Never Far Away\\", \\"Scream\\", \\"Long Gone\\", \\"Sweet Revenge\\" and \\"Enemy\\" for a long time to come.     Is it as good as Soundgarden or Audioslave? No, I do not believe it is. However, if you look at the vast history of music, it is rare to find an artist from a great band who is able to capture the same magic on a solo album. No Kim Thayil or Tom Morello contributes to this I have no doubt, that extra creative musical influence pushes things forward a degree into greatness.     However, the common denominator in all that was still Cornell. He may not be ascending to the peaks of his past, but what he is doing now is at least still fresh and creative. And I, for one, am still looking forward to what he does next. I know it will be worth my time.     3.5 out of 5 stars

1402756399|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"When on board...[Her Majesty's Ship] 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants [that is, plants and animals] of South America, and the geologic relations of the present to past inhabitants of that continent.  These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.\\"<br /><br />The above are the first two sentences that begin what many describe as a seminal work in scientific literature and a landmark work in evolutionary biology.  This book (whose full title is \\"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or, the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\\") was written by Charles Darwin (1809 to 1882) and this first edition was published in November 1859.  This illustrated edition was edited by David Quammen, an author and recognized writer.<br /><br />But you'll find more (much more!!) between the covers of this illustated edition than just the original text of Darwin's great book.  In it are written excerpts from the following books:<br /><br />(1) \\"The Voyage of the Beagle\\"<br />(2) \\"The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin\\"<br />(3) \\"The Autobiography of Charles Darwin\\"<br /><br />From these major sources and other sources are included, as well, images of some of the places Darwin visited, some of the creatures he saw, and the ship itself.  Also included is a gallery of reproductions of photographs, oil portraits, oil woodcuts, sketches, cartoons, coloured lithographs from the book \\"The Zoology of the Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle,\\" etc. (Thus, when they say this is \\"The Illustrated Edition,\\" they're not kidding!!)<br /><br />There is also a chronology that tracks Darwin's life as well as images or pictures related to him as a man and to concepts of his great work.  Those major persons for and against Darwin's ideas are also shown.<br /><br />Editor Quammen describes the \\"On the Origin of Species\\" text (which I'll refer as the 1859 TEXT):<br /><br />\\"[It] wasn't written for experts.  It was written for everybody who reads, thinks, and wonders.  The prose is sometimes laborious and often elegant; the details are fascinating, the logic is lucid and firm; and the voice...is the voice of an affable English gentleman.\\"<br /><br />This book can be read in one of two ways:<br /><br />(1) You can read the book from start to finish.  As you come to the written excerpts, sketches, photos, etc., you can divert your attention from reading the 1859 TEXT, read or look over these, and then continue reading the 1859 TEXT.<br /><br />(2) You can read and look over all the written excerpts, sketches, photos, etc. first.  Then go back to the beginning and read the 1859 TEXT.<br /><br />Personally, I chose method (2).  I found that when I did this that I learned much about Charles Darwin, the man and scientist.  I found that after I had learned something about Darwin himself, that my interest in his 1859 TEXT was piqued and I wanted to read it since, for some reason, it didn't seem so intimidating.<br /><br />When reading the 1859 TEXT, you may find the prose difficult to read at first.  I found that as I kept reading, I got used to the prose style, and the reading actually got easier.  Also, it seems to me that Darwin has bent over backwards to make his 1859 TEXT easy to understand because he provides brief summaries at the beginning of each chapter and the last chapter is actually a summary.<br /><br />Here are the chapter titles for the 1859 TEXT (which are the same for this illustrated book):<br /><br />(1) Variation under domestication<br />(2) Variation under nature<br />(3) Struggle for existence<br />(4) Natural selection<br />(5) Laws of variation<br />(6) Difficulties [with my] theory<br />(7) Instinct<br />(8) Hybridism<br />(9) On the imperfection of the geological record<br />(10) On the geological succession of organic beings<br />(11) Geographical distribution<br />(12) Geological distribution [continued]<br />(13) Mutual affinities of organic beings: morphology: embryology: rudimentary organs<br />(14) Recapitulation and conclusion<br /><br />There is a fascinating appendix to this illustrated edition entitled \\"An historical sketch of the progress of opinion on 'On The Origin of Species.'\\"  This appendix was added as a foreword to the third edition of \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" published in 1861. (Note that \\"On the Origin of Species\\" had six editions that were published during Darwin's lifetime.)<br /><br />Finally, after the appendix, there is a helpful glossary to aid in ever greater comprehension of the 1859 TEXT.  (Note that Darwin did not include a glossary in his original 1859 publication.)<br /><br />In conclusion, with all the extras included to compliment Charles Darwin's masterpiece of observation and deduction, this book is truly a pleasure to read. I leave you with Darwin's final words:<br /><br />\\"There is grandeur in this view of life [that is, grandeur in the laws of nature], with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms [of life] or into one [form of life]; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"<br /><br />(illustrated edition first published 2008;  introduction (to this book by David Quammen);  introduction (to \\"On the Origin of Species\\" by Charles Darwin);  14 chapters;  main narrative 515 pages;  appendix;  glossary;  picture credits;  index)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXgraphical distribution<br />(12) Geological distribution [continued]<br />(13) Mutual affinities of organic beings: morphology: embryology: rudimentary organs<br />(14) Recapitulation and conclusion<br /><br />There is a fascinating appendix to this illustrated edition entitled \\"An historical sketch of the progress of opinion on 'On The Origin of Species.'\\"  This appendix was added as a foreword to the third edition of \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" published in 1861.

I have to say this album is amazing, and I love how these 3 different genres mix so strongly.  I have their other albums, but this tops them all. \\"Planet Hell\\" and \\"Nemo\\" have to be their best songs ever to be released because they show just how these genres mix so well.  They, along with their other songs were composed so well and thats why I love this album as well as the band. 5.
1433502402|5.0|I have had this study bible now since I received my pre-publication order last fall and am more convinced than ever this is only study Bible to even think about getting. I waited before posting because I always fall in love with every new study Bible that comes down the pike but in two months most are on the bottom shelf, never to be looked at again, collecting dust until I give them away. My usage of the ESV SB has only increased over time. It is my use of other Bible resource tools which has Decreased. Tools like a Strong's, commentaries, Bible atlases, Bible dictionaries, etc, etc. It's all here, in one book, and it now takes a lot less time to prepare for a Bible study meeting. I won't repeat what others have said about the tons of quality materials and visual aids but would, instead, give a real life example.   My Bible study group voted to study the book of Joshua next as we are finishing up the book of Romans.   I attended a study of Joshua a couple of years ago and agree to lead this study as I knew I still had the reference works I had purchased to participate in the earlier study. Anyone who has gotten deep in Joshua knows you MUST have a Bible atlas at hand as you read. Joshua is all about land...conquering it, settling it and dividing it up. Without an atlas you never know who's doing what, where. The book of Joshua in the ESVSB has a ton of full color maps sprinkled in among the study notes so you need only glance down to the bottom of the page to know exactly where you are at as you read the text. Then there is a full page color map of the 12 tribes' land designations right where it needs to be. It's beautiful. Since every purchaser of the ESVSB get's an access code to the online version of the Bible, every single map can be downloaded and turned into a PowerPoint slide or inserted into a handout you prepare with Word.  In addition to the incredible visual aids, the multi-page introduction and outline to Joshua is awesome, giving all the necessary historical background info, timelines, and important elements to notice in this book which serves as the transition from the Torah to the historical books. Finally, the voluminous study notes which accompany the Bible text are better than the commentary book by James Boice which I bought the last time I studied Joshua.   When you add the available cross-references and charts which go along with the notes, I have everything here I need to lead a group study on the book of Joshua, they are better than the resources I had last time and they are all in one book. HELLOOOOOOO, ESV study bible...where have YOU been all my life.  For anyone...student, leader or teacher who wants to get deeper into the Bible - this is best single volume resource for doing so in the entire known universe. Trust me on this one.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I can't stress enough how much of a foreign film this is. American films and therefore American audiences generally expect something with more bang for their buck. Bigger, flashier, faster is normally what we get. And there are films that that philosophy serve well. But films from other countries, especially countries that tend to be a little colder temperature-wise, are much more deliberately paced. The movement in a film like LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a little more staccato, like someone moving through snow and ice. Some steps are very slow and methodical, and the next steps may require faster movement in order to stay upright.<br /><br />This is not to say that LET THE RIGHT ONE IN moves in an uneven rhythm; quite the opposite. It's a film that keeps its pace and its tone very consistent. To call this film a \\"horror\\" film is akin to calling WALL-E an \\"animated\\" film. It's pigeon-holing it and doing it a serious injustice. With all the hyperbole on the case for the DVD for this film, people are going to more than likely be expecting something that moves quickly and has lots of gore and sexuality, as most vampire films do. But that is just not happening in this film.<br /><br />A lot has been said about the story of this film, and I don't have anything to add to that, but as far as my thoughts about this film are concerned, with a few exceptions, I just couldn't recommend a film from 2008 as highly. The two young leads have a chemistry together that puts most adult screen couples to shame. There is never a moment that seems forced, false or out of place. The dialogue, direction, and cinematography are all some of the finest that you'll see in a film all year. It's an extrememly moody film, that has moments of raw emotional brutality and shocking violence, because when it happens, you don't expect it, and that's exactly what makes a film like this work so incredibly well. Violence never should be telegraphed with a film of this kind. It should come as a bolt out of the blue that leaves your jaw hitting the ground, and that's exactly what LET THE RIGHT ONE IN does.<br /><br />And there are moments in the film that you'll never forget.<br /><br />Many fans of the vampire horror genre have been waiting for the definitive vampire film, and this may not have the epic sweep of something like Neil Jordan's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE or the hyperkinetic bloodletting of one of the BLADE films or the nostalgia of the DRACULA films, but this is definitely the best \\"vampire\\" film that I've ever seen, and ranks amongst the best of 2008.aves your jaw hitting the ground, and that's exactly what LET THE RIGHT ONE IN does.

0316017922|2.0|In the past, I've been a fan of Gladwell's work.  While critics may attack Blink's overall tone, I felt that Gladwell took adequate time to identify cases where his \\"interesting outcome\\" didn't hold true.  Unfortunately, in \\"Outliers\\", Gladwell picks up on the wrong theme and is forced into repeated and systematic fallacy to try and support his point.    Put simply, Gladwell argues that the most successful people in the world, the \\"outliers\\", are not a product of raw talent or ability.  Indeed, Gladwell identifies a number of important dimensions related to success:     - effort (investing 10,000 hours in a project)   - connections (who you know)   - upbringing (\\"concerned\\" parenting)   - timing (success comes when the economy is primed for what you offer)   - luck    Of course, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the \\"outliers\\", the most amazingly successful people in the world, lie on the fortunate end of basically ALL of these dimensions.  If each dimension was a separate die it's kind of like saying \\"to roll the highest number in dice, you need to roll lots of 5s and 6s\\" - phrased properly, the argument is practically mundane.  Instead, Gladwell uses this evidence to argue that, in fact, talent plays **basically no role** in success.    To make this point, he is forced to select evidence that is flat out flawed.  Take one specific example:    Gladwell finds that, within a particular music school, the level of effort is the only major predictor of success for this group of students.  Finding no \\"other factor\\", he argues that talent must be an illusion that plays no role in success.  Unfortunately, this is a sophisticated form of Selection Bias, \\"a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected.\\" ([...])      Given the huge diversity of options available to students, it's reasonable to expect that music majors at a particular school would be of generally similar talent.  What if we were talking about MIT?  Certainly, we would expect some people to get into the school as a result of hard work and not pure talent, but even the least gifted MIT student is probably in the top 5%, and perhaps the top 1 or 2% of talent.    Now if we take that sample, with little variety in talent, and attempt to determine what leads to success, how much role do you think talent will really play?  Given a group with *similar talent*, it is again obvious that the level of effort will play a substantial role in their level of success.    It's not that talent plays no role, but that talent levels are so similar that their impact on performance is equally trivial.  The book is replete with these examples, using rhetoric and poor argumentation to write off the few remaining outliers that disprove his thesis.    The book has some fun stories and is therefore an interesting read, but I give it two stars because the basic premise and the arguments used in support of the premise are badly flawed.
078322740X|5.0|Even before viewing a film with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, a film viewer knows the film already has a comedic caché. \\"Housesitter\\" is one of the best comedies of the past 20 years and remains fresh and funny after repeated viewings.  Hawn as a chronic but charming liar and Martin as a man trying to jump-start his faltering personal and professional lives, make for a winning combination. The supporting cast is wonderful, with the street people Hawn hires to pose as her \\"parents\\" hilarious and yet touching. This is a film to own and watch repeatedly.

031606792X|1.0|This book is very different from the first three. I didn't care for the many mention of bed scenes emphasizing that vampires destroy things during their 'moments'. As I read further into the book, it became more and more like X-men especially during the showdown between the Volturi clan and the others. It just didn't seem to have the same emotional sensitivity as the other books. Perhaps some like it but I didn't.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|...because it's right on the money.  This tragically short-lived show burned so brightly before being abruptly snuffed out.  As you've probably gathered, it's a sci-fi character study, with generous amounts of action and drama.  The story-telling is compelling.  For example, one episode begins in media res (in the middle), and the scenes fromn the past are effectively blended into the same shots as the scenes from the present.    The characters are mostly good people, but there's not a lot of high-handed moral pontificating.  Ethical questions are raised, rather than knee-jerk fingerpointing.  My favorite character, the mercenary Jayne Cobb, is basically amoral, though on the same crew as the \\"good guys.\\"  He's unintelligent, though cunning, and cleverly used by the show's writers.  His relationship with Captain Reynolds is like a pit-bull on a short tether.      I could go on about the special effects, the blending of the sci-fi and western genres, the subtle-yet-belly-laugh-inducing humor, but I'm not going to.  I, like thousands prior, give this one five stars.  Wish I'd known about it while it was still running.

Personally having Indian roots but having studied western Astrology, I found that this book helped fill so many gaps in my knowledge, which I simple accepted as facts earlier.     If you want to dive into why ? and how ? this book is the best one you can choose. The language is fluid, at times its hard, but makes a very good read. Would recommend it to anyone with a bit of western knowledge who wants to learn the Indian system as well.     Rgds  Anand Chawra
B001FB55HG|4.0|This is what ive been hoping for all these years.... HEAVY METAL WAR! To finally see the battles of John Connor will face as we been told in the previous installments. Of-course we all know this takes place after the events of T3 with the world, well you know. Humans being outnumbered and rounded up like cattle into slavery to build machines for SKYNET. After reading alot on the net and seeing it for myself on every trailer, we see John Connor and his wife Kate fulfilling their destiny as mankind's only hope for survival by leading the resistenceto victory. Two people we will encounter is a young Kyle Reese who any fan would remember from the first film and who protected Sarah Connor and conceived John with her. the other is  decommissioned Terminator who has secret that i dont want to spoil but questions about him are asked if he was sent from the future or was saved from the past. I know theres nay sayers who will say this will flop because it's James cameron's baby and he's still not involved, and because theres rumors about a PG-13 rating. and if it comes to that, i read already there will be a R-rated Director's cut on dvd. All depends on the director and the studio,but im sure we wont be let down. one thing that gives me confidence with the film is Arnold in a way is involved and Linda Hamilton is back for voice-overs at the beginning and end of the film. voice-overs used for tapes Sarah made for John while she was pregnant warning him about his future and destiny. the cast looks great, im not familiar with the MCG's work as director but he sounds like he's takin the franchise's future seriously not just for this film but two more if this one is a success which im hoping for.Bottom line is i cant wait for May 21st to come.
B000002KIT|5.0|LIVE AND DANGEROUS is a wonderful live CD featuring Thin Lizzy's best-known lineup. Bassist-vocalist-songwriter Phil Lynott sings with a passion rarely heard on the band's studio releases, while guitarists Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson play powerful, aggressive solos and drummer Brian Downey holds the whole thing together with his powerhouse drums. This is an album that is essential for anyone remotely interested in 70s hard rock.
B000W1V5OC|5.0|I recently discovered Nightwish by way of this DVD (where have I been not knowing of this fantastic sound, now I am buying all their older stuff).  They \\"were\\" absolutely amazing (the new Nightwish is a pop remake of the old and has lost what they once were).  The reviews here tell it all.  It is both sad and disappointing that Tarja is no longer a member because Nightwish is not Nightwish without her (smart people make stupid decisions).  Annette of the new Nightwish just does not provide the mystique, presence and heavenly voice that Tarja did.  It would be a gift to all if the band got back together.

B000001FTA|5.0|On BAD REPUTATION, Thin Lizzy, in spite of the fact that guitarist Brian Robertson was out of the picture on all but three songs, managed to put together one of their finest albums ever. Scott Gorham responded fantastically to the pressure, coming through with some of his most aggressive playing ever in order to cover for Robertson's absence. Bassist-vocalist-songwriter Phil Lynott also let his jazz and folk influences shine through in spots, resulting in one of the band's most musically diverse albums ever. Overall, BAD REPUTATION is essential for anyone even remotely interested in 70s heavy metal.

B000001EC1|4.0|Cross Road by Bon Jovi is a fantastic greatest hits album and I am normally not a fan of these types of albums. Songs like Runaway, You Give Love a Bad Name, I'll Be There For You, Always, Blaze of Glory, and Bed of Roses are still good to this day. John Bon Jovi has such a memorable voice, I highly recommend this rockin' trip down memory lane, enjoy!
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater. I am latin and Irish. I hate to say this but, you have all missed the point of this story. Kevin's character was a friend of Anthony Quinn's character.  He was kind to Costners' character, no matter what. The betrayal came from Costners character and Tibey's wife...Under Tibey's own roof. What kind of friend and wife is that..?? Tibey had to act on his anger and vile betrayal coming from his best friend and his wife.. How could he continue to command respect from his men? I know it sounds horrible, but she knew what would happen if she messed around like this..she had known him all her life.  Kevin's character as well...he had been his friend for a long time...he knew what Tibey would do.  Did he think he would just forget about it and go on with his life..? Impossible.  Don't forget. the one who was betrayed by both was Tibey... I own the director's cut.  It is even more detailed than what I saw in the movie theater.  I can't fault Tibey for his actions. Even if I know they are wrong. No latin man is going to allow this to happen and not seek revenge, not this extreme, but there will be retaliation.
B001N26GFM|1.0|Mr. Iger of Walt Disney World Companies (miramax).<br />There are many movies we would liked to have seen but, they do not have ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the menu set up.  Why is it that a movie being distributed in the United States of America has spanish or some other language for subtitles in the menu set up?  The PRIMARY language in America is ENGLISH.  As we are hearing impaired and must have ENGLISH closed captions in the menu set up.  I guess we will miss a lot of the movies produced by your companies.<br />Without ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the movie menu set up, we will not be able to purchase particular movies of interest.  The one of most recent interest was The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas.  You lost a sale on this one and I am sure as well as others in the future.

It's a gorgeous, impeccably edited and photographed (of course) compendium of all manner of cookie delights, with clear descriptions, techniques, and tips. Also some interesting interpretations of traditonal favorites, such as Rugelach Fingers - a bar-cookie interpretation of the traditional crescent-shaped confection. Sure to please your inner baker.
B001CEC1E6|5.0|This is a great earlier album by this band. With their growing popularity and talk of a tour in the states, its a must have if your a fan of later albums. Its lil more expensive because of shipping and importing but well worth it. Im very happy I found it.
B000JJ4PDK|5.0|When I first heard this album I wasn't even in to rap music. I hated it. I only wanted to hear alternative rock. One night I was over at my friend's house and I saw the video for \\"Big Poppa\\" and I loved it. I thought that Biggie's flow was insanely smooth and that his lifestyle was like a Scarface movie or something, seeing Puffy in the hottub only made it more crazy. This remastered anniversary set is great. It features the original album plus Who Shot Ya and Dreams (ode to R&B singers Biggie wants to sex). The bonus DVD is a nice addition too with all of the music videos for this album. If you don't own a copy of this album yet buy this version it's the best!

B001MYIXAC|4.0|What do you get when you cross a vampire story with a tender tale of impossible love?  If you answered \\"Twilight,\\" then you haven't seen \\"Let the Right One In,\\" a Swedish horror movie with an art-house sheen.<br /><br />Oskar (the excellent Kare Hedebrant) is the twelve-year-old schoolboy who's the perpetual target of a trio of bullies; Eli (the equally fine Lina Leandersson) is the fetching young vampire who moves into the apartment next door.  Together, these two social outcasts form a powerful emotional bond, with Eli hiding the truth about herself from Oskar till the point where she no longer can.<br /><br />Written by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own novel) and directed by Tomas Alfredson, \\"Let the Right One In\\" is less concerned with the blood-and-guts aspects of the scenario than with the pain and remorse each of the main characters experiences throughout the course of the drama.  Though obviously craving a \\"normal\\" life, Eli is hopelessly trapped by her own nature, forced to endure a life of loneliness and killing simply to survive in the world.  Oskar is equally alone, though for more prosaic reasons.  In addition to the constant bullying, Oskar is a product of a broken home, and like Eli, he too may finally have to resort to violence to ensure his existence.  Then there's Eli's father who numbly and methodically performs the gruesome bloodletting rituals he knows he must if his daughter is to survive.<br /><br />There's a genuine poignancy in the fact that Eli knows that she can never give herself fully to Oskar for fear of consigning him to the same murderous fate she herself must endure.  A similar sense of twisted pathos pervades Eli's relationship with her father, who carries paternalistic duty to a whole new, genuinely disturbing level.<br /><br />All of this is played out against stark, sparsely-furnished, minimalist settings that provide an appropriately atmospheric backdrop for the story being told.<br /><br />As \\"art\\" horror films go, this one is not quite as bone-chilling or as memorable as the truly diabolical \\"Funny Games,\\" but it still provides a welcome respite from all those inane, studio-manufactured products we're forced to endure on a regular basis when Hollywood sets its sights on terror.or as memorable as the truly diabolical \\"Funny Games,\\" but it still provides a welcome respite from all those inane, studio-manufactured products we're forced to endure on a regular basis when Hollywood sets its sights on terror.
B0018QQQKS|4.0|The Ascent Of Money is by all means not the \\"comprehensive\\" book on the role of money and credit in the economy; however, Niall Ferguson has written a very entertaining book.  The book's divisions into major themes that are covered by the author via a series of historical anecdotes provides a very illuminating \\"high level\\" overview of the importance of capital markets in the development of the modern world.    The author's writing style flows more like a fictional narrative than a history book-- which is an impressive feat considering the subject matter.  If there was one \\"negative\\" I would have with the book is that while many relevant issues are brought up/explained in 'layman's' terms, we don't really get much in terms of potential solutions to the issues (sub-prime mortgages, health care/Social Security insolvency, etc).    Overall, though, The Ascent Of Money is a great book that will both entertain as well as teach you about the world's complex financial history.  There is a PBS special on this book that was shown back in January 2009 also--the show hits all the major themes in the book.  If you enjoy the special, the book will be even more enjoyable, as it will fill in even more details from the TV special.

6305313687|5.0|A very eyeopening, intense drama that will have you questioning America's pursuit to quelling conflicts between racial ethnicity in this country. This film gets an A+ for reminding us where our country's been and where our country has become from its shaky history with race. Although, I have to warn, this film may offend those who are quite sensitive to the issue so if you are one of those people I suggest you watch something else... perhaps a Disney movie or something of that nature.

B000001ELL|4.0|I have always hated how everybody mocks this album as KISS \\"sellout\\" and just because of that they assume it's bad. No, this album is not as bad as its reputation, and it is actually one of my favorite KISS albums next to Destroyer.    Also, a lot of people says that Ace Frehley is the one who saves this album with his rockin' tunes... are you people serious??? Does anyone remember \\"Hard times\\" or \\"Save your love\\"? Let's admit it, Ace's cover of 2000 man was fine, decent, but should have been his only contribution to the album. It's not him who shines here, but Paul.    I was made for lovin' you and Sure know something are amongst Paul's greatest gems. Polished or unpolished, live or unplugged, these songs always sound great and will be standing forever. I'm very happy that Paul even decided to resurrect Magic touch for his most recent tour. Yeah people! Don't be politically correct! I know it sounds cool to say that Ace is who rocks here, but hey! Let's give Mr. Stanley some credit!    I also think Peter's contribution is very decent. I know it was entirely made for dancefloors, but who cares! It's still a great tune! (I remember listening to the remix version on my green 33 rpm lp when I was like 8-9 years old).    So, even though this is obviously not KISS best, this is still a great effort. I have great sympathy for KISS experimental albums like this one, The elder and Carnival of souls. They just prove that KISS is great even beyond Rock and roll all nite.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Catherine Tate gets my vote as the best actress to work alongside The Doctor.  Omce again the series out does itself.  \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"Forest of the Dead\\" are among thest written, directed and acted episodes ever - and look, it's Steve Pemberton from \\"League of Gentlemen\\")...Donna Noble has been saved....I'll never forget that.  The Ood are back - and you'll be devasted.  My favorite of the season was \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\" with the great Fenella Woolgar as Agatha Christie.  Already a great actress, when is someone going to make Woolgar a great movie star?  I can't wait for the specials and then the 11th Doctor.

B0000028M7|5.0|Like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains were incorrectly labeled with the \\"grunge\\" moniker because of where they came from and when they hit. While grunge music was usually a showcase for abysmal vocals and sub-par musicianship, both these bands featured incredible vocalists and instrumentalists that really knew how to play.     However, where Soundgarden drew inspiration from early hard rock like Led Zeppelin, Alice in Chains' sound was more akin to doom metal of bands such as Black Sabbath. The thing that really made Alice stand out from the crowd, though was frontman Layne Staley. Staley's spine tingling voice was a beautiful yet disturbing showcase for emotion and pain. Listen to the title track and you'll know what I mean.    The other thing that really separated Alice from the pack was guitarist Jerry Cantrell who's riffs range from crunching adrenaline rushes (Them Bones, Dam That River), to somber, soulful melodies (Rooster, Down in a Hole), to nightmarish noises (Hate to Feel, Sickman).    The final thing that made Alice different was the same thing that made them so great: the lyrics. They're hellish and disturbing, but at the same time oddly poetic in their description of the world of a man who has nothing to live for. The lyrics and tunes also increase in their darkness as the LP progresses giving it the feeling of a downward spiral.    If you're looking for a CD to liven up the party, this sure isn't it. However, if you're looking for an excellent example of how music can be used as art and an outlet for emotion, look no further than Dirt.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Alan Ball of \\"American Beauty\\" (Oscar) and \\"Six Feet Under\\" (Emmy) has created this adaptation of the bestselling vampire series.  All of the actors are wonderful - and sexy (and some are down right naked - thank you Alan).  This is like no vampire film I've ever seen - and a wonderful rift on the whole gay rights movement - with vampires coming out of the closet and demanding civil rights - who'd a thunk it.  Any series with Lois Smith gets my attention.  This is smart, sexy and scary.  Bring on season two - can't wait.

B001JJBO74|4.0|The Guide is a likable introduction to perfume. The chapters on the basics (genres, difference male/female, bit of chemistry, etc) are informative and to the point. Most of the reviews are pretty fair, well written and, not unimportant, at times very funny. The top-10's aren't without controversy and probably should not be followed/purchased blindly. The only problem I found was that some popular, albeit older male perfumes (for instance Quorum, indeed all of Puig is absent, Drakkar Noir, Lagerfeld or YSL pour Homme) are not graded although they still are in production. Well, you obviously can't review them all. Recommended reading if you want to have an overview of the field before you walk into a store for your next fragrance.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Russell Davies is a great, great artist.  He has done for the \\"Doctor Who\\" franchise what Rick Berman (and assoc) did for \\"Star Trek\\" - he has brought it back bigger and better than ever.  Obviously the special effects are better than the original (which were pretty meager - to be polite) - but who would have expected them to be motion picture quality? (Yes - they are THAT good).  But all would be for naught without great writing, directing and acting - and the new Doctor Who has all and more.<br /><br />I love all the episodes set in the past.  Mark Gatiss wrote \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" which features Simon Callow as Charles Dickens; \\"The Empy Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" (in which we meet Captain Jack) had me in tears; as did \\"Father's Day.\\"  \\"Boom Town\\" features negelected actress Annette Badland in a performance that should have won her an Emmy/BAFTA).  The entire series is one high note after another.  I'll cherish these discs until Daleks come to take them from me.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|Not the best of the series but different. Its an okay movie, its appeal is directed to only some audiences, hence children and car enthusiasts.
1400063515|1.0|A book full of conceited, repetitive, self-serving twaddle, based on a single mundane observation.  The observation is simply that \\"attempts to measure risk using historical data and/or the assumption of (Gaussian) Normality will fail spectacularly sooner or later, because of extreme outlier events\\". While an important observation, Taleb is nowhere near the first to make it. The padding required to blow this observation out to an entire book is enough to supply the global mattress industry for the next few decades. Taleb's repeated insinuation - or in some cases the bald statement - that almost all academics except himself are fools starts out simply offensive, but rapidly becomes boring.    The only interesting parts of the book are Taleb's memories of Lebanon, before and after the onset of civil war, a fascinating first-hand reminiscence. What a pity he didn't stick to that subject.    Apart from the annoying boasting, whining, repetition and \\"look at me\\" tricks, the book's major flaw is that it has nothing constructive to propose. It is easy (and trite) to observe that all models are simplifications of reality and will err in extreme conditions, but that is a long way short of a convincing argument that all models and theories should be discarded. Without models and theories we would have no computers or telephony (the sources of one of Taleb's favourite 'Black Swans' - the internet), no electric grid, no space travel, no hydraulics or water supply, no genetics and very few modern medicines.    I bought this book because I had heard that it was ground-breaking, insightful and influential. Influential it may be, but it is neither of the other two. I would recommend people considering buying it to instead just consider and adopt the maxim 'be sceptical of [but not outright hostile to] all theories and models', then save themselves the time and the money by not buying this book and instead reading something by Douglas Adams (a much more entertaining sceptic) or Evelyn Waugh.

0198326769|1.0|See family move to Out-With. See German boy meet suffering Jewish prisoner boy. See oblivious boy act selfish, insensitive and save his own skin. See boy finally see boy's world.<br /><br />The plot of this story is unlikely to the point of ridiculousness. A nine-year old German boy, son of a recently promoted Commandant, moves with his family to \\"Out-With,\\" where he lives for about a year without, for the most part, getting much more than a few tiny clues about the goings on at the place. Problems with the actions of the characters, plot, and writing abound.<br /><br />How does an ethnic German, even a child, come up with \\"Out-With\\" for a word that sounds like Ow-shvitz? Same question for mistaking \\"Fury\\" for \\"Fyoorer.\\" This language issue is totally distracting in its unlikelihood as is the fact that at least twice during the (relatively short) story the German boy says things that no nine-year-old would say, like (on page 58), \\"...If you ask me, we're all in the same boat. And it's leaking',\\" and (on page 78) when he is injured, opening a \\"wide gash\\" on his knee, he merely says, \\"'Oh, dear.'\\"<br /><br />Secondly, there is the odds-defying undetected recurring regular rendezvous between the two boys over an extended period of time. Where were the guards? And what was Mom doing all day, every day, that she wouldn't notice his absence?<br /><br />Third, the birth date issue is probably less likely to occur than a character being struck by lightning several times.<br /><br />Fourth, the German boy, having seen prisoners a number of times, does not notice that they are emaciated until halfway through the book (p 107).<br /><br />Fifth, an adult (p 137) recklessly reveals secrets to a child, even saying as he or she does so, \\"'you mustn't tell anyone - do you understand? We would all get in terrible trouble.'\\" Why would they risk such a thing when lives were at stake?<br /><br />Lastly, the writing is so simplistic as to sound like something straight out of a Dick and Jane reader. That is to say, the reading level is about third grade, the topic generally more appropriate for fifth and up. And the character development is nil, making it impossible to care much about any of the non-prisoners.<br /><br />There are so many fabulous books and movies on this subject that I can't imagine anyone wasting their time reading this terrible tale. Infinitely better: Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl; (my personal favorite) The Book Thief by Markus Zusak; Life in Auschwitz by Primo Levy; Night by Elie Wiesel; Times' Arrow by Martin Amis; and the movies: Life is Beautiful, Schindler's List, The Pianist, and The Sound of Music.out third grade, the topic generally more appropriate for fifth and up.

B000T9OP7G|4.0|Have TV shows left behind episodic TV to take on the trappings of the novel? TV is now full of shows that have a vision of the series as a whole with a beginning, middle and end fully plotted before they even hit the screen. Shows like Lost, Hero's, Mad Men, and The Sarah Connor Chronicles have changed how we look at TV shows, and maybe the way we should think about them as well.<br /><br />I have to admit that when the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles went on I was excited, being as I'm a fan of The Terminator movies but as I watched the first couple of episodes I lost interest. Then I applied for a job as book reviewer for an ezine and they also wanted the book reviewer to review a science fiction TV series as well, so I picked The Sarah Connor Chronicles. I didn't get the gig reviewing books for that particular ezine but I watched the entire first season in one or two sittings and was able to view it as  a whole and saw the emerging themes and directions the creators of the show were trying to take, and I got excited about the possibilities they were exploring.<br /><br />The Sarah Connor Chronicles picks up after the second Terminator movie. Sarah and John have settled down a bit, Sarah in love and living with a paramedic in Colorado, but they're still doing their best to stay off the grid and not attract attention to themselves. A Terminator shows up at John's school one day as a substitute teacher with a gun implanted in his thigh. When he opens fire and chaos ensues John is saved by Cameron, the cute new girl sitting next to him in class, who seems to be able to take a bullet pretty well. John escapes to the parking lot with the teacher terminator hot on his trail and just as John is cornered Cameron comes out of nowhere with a truck and runs down the terminator, and reveals herself to be a terminator sent by the future John Connor to save his teenage self. John and Cameron find Sarah but the police and the not quite terminated terminator are in hot pursuit of the three of them. Cameron leads them to a bank vault a seeming dead end, but the future John Connor has been planning ahead (or is it behind?) and he's been sending emissaries back in time to set up an infrastructure to protect himself in the past. Cameron rips open safety deposit boxes and starts assembling a device, a time machine, Cameron is going to hide John and Sarah in the future!<br /><br />After the escape to the future John convinces Sarah and Cameron that they can do more than wait for judgment day that they can again go after Skynet and destroy it before it can be built. They also discover that the terminator after John at the school got caught in the time vortex they went through so he's still after them, although he's a bit beat up and needs to reconstitute himself. Another antagonist FBI agent James Ellison is introduced, a police detective who believes Sarah Connor killed some police officers, and this addition has kind of The Fugitive feel to it and never really develops anything passed that.<br /><br />Sarah soon discovers a computer prototype called The Turk that could become Skynet and built by a computer geek Andy Good, but she is able to torch it and unfortunately Andy's dreams. But John Connor isn't the only one salting away things in the past to change the future, Skynet is also stashing things such as a type of steel to build terminators. Sarah discovers that Andy has rebuilt The Turk and she runs off to destroy it (again) but finds she's too late that The Turk has been stolen and Andy Good has been killed by Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle who came back in the first Terminator movie to save her. Derek joins Sarah and John but is distrustful of Cameron and her motives because she is terminator but also because he knew her in the future and isn't convinced she doesn't have a hidden agenda, and some of her actions might indicate she has something to hide, Derek and Sarah discover that Cameron has kept a chip from a terminator but is she keeping it for Skynet's agenda? Or does she have a secret mission from the future John Connor?<br /><br />In one of the more interesting episodes Bruce Davison plays another of his characters bordering on insanity. He's the psychiatrist at the mental institution Sarah escaped from in the second movie and he's stolen a hand from a terminator and Sarah is in a race to retrieve it before FBI agent Ellison does. In the penultimate episode of the season the doubts about Cameron finally come to the surface when it is discovered she saved the chip she was supposed to destroy. Cameron's motivations and actions increasingly are under scrutiny by Sarah. In the final episode Sarah and gang are offered the chance to buy the Turk for half a million dollars, and Sarah's love interest returns, and in the cliffhanging last scene Cameron is blown up by a truck bomb.<br /><br />I hadn't heard of most of the cast before The Sarah Connor Chronicles but in researching this review I found that most of them have pretty solid television credibility having appeared on Hero's, Firefly, and The 300, all pretty solid shows with reputations for smart episodes, so it seems the cast was picked well. The acting is uniformly good it doesn't delve into kitsch or melodramatics and the possibility always exists for those roads to be taken. Brian Austin Green who started his career in the great Spelling schmaltz factory of 90210 had me worried when he came into the show in the third or fourth episode as Derek Reese but he has consistently shown that he has the capabilities of good acting and has even carried the dramatics in a couple of the episodes.<br /><br />Allusion and metaphor aren`t found in a lot of TV shows, in a smartly written show you can find one or the other but not usually both. In the Sarah Conner Chronicles chess is used as a metaphor, and yes, I know chess is an overused metaphor in a lot of things but they didn't belabor the point and it worked in the context of the episode. The themes that are explored in The Sarah Conner Chronicles are more ambitious than in the Terminator movies. The show explores do the terminators cause people to act more machine like? Can machines learn to love man enough to need them? Can man love (come to terms with) his need for machines?<br /><br />Each of the three DVD's have bonus features that are quite a fun enhancement to the set. I enjoyed the actor audition video's especially Lena Headey's. She's an English actress and she effects an American accent quite well and believably but as soon as she drops out of character her English accent is noticeable and almost undecipherable!<br /><br />I think anyone who liked The Terminator movies and wants to explore that world a little deeper will certainly enjoy this series, as well as someone not all that knowledgeable about The Terminator world.agenda?

The themes that are explored in The Sarah Conner Chronicles are more ambitious than in the Terminator movies. The show explores do the terminators cause people to act more machine like? Can machines learn to love man enough to need them? Can man love (come to terms with) his need for machines?    Each of the three DVD's have bonus features that are quite a fun enhancement to the set. I enjoyed the actor audition video's especially Lena Headey's. She's an English actress and she effects an American accent quite well and believably but as soon as she drops out of character her English accent is noticeable and almost undecipherable!    I think anyone who liked The Terminator movies and wants to explore that world a little deeper will certainly enjoy this series, as well as someone not all that knowledgeable about The Terminator world.
B001GM28HO|5.0|GaGa's album is actually really good. She brings a freshness to pop which is lacking now in days. Besides the traditional pop veterans that are out there now(Britney Spears, Madonna). GaGa is a brealth of fresh air. This album is upbeat and just what is consider pop/dance music. I can't wait to see what she has in store for us in her next album.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Wow! While I read several reviews about this film that were all positive, I did'nt expect to love this movie like I did. I was worried I would'nt be able to relate to the two main characters because of their young age. Well hats off to Kare and Lina because they were incredible. This will sound corny, but if you only see one movie this year, make it this one.

B000LPQ6DE|1.0|[Just a quick side note, I am NOT Ronda. I am her slightly imbalanced teenage daughter who is obsessed with Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, and all things romantic. You can't even have a decent conversation with me without getting nauseated:)]     First off, I would like to say that I loved this movie. I realize my rating would suggest otherwise, but people always read the bad reviews, so I decided to be manipulative. Ruth Wilson portrays Jane perfectly. I've always despised how in most portrayals Jane is shown as a sombre, quiet little thing who always wears black, hardly ever opens her mouth, and barely, if ever, smiles. [Despite this, I am a big fan of the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg version and highly recommend it to all] But if you read Jane Eyre carefully, [which I have three times by now] you can easily tell that this is NOT the case, Jane is full of passion, and speaks with a great deal of animation. True, she certainly isn't giggly and talkative, absolutely not, but definitely not a prude. Ruth Wilson was a perfectly ethereal Jane, how could Mr. Rochester NOT love her?? Toby Stephens does a remarkable job in his role of Mr. Rochester as well, some people have complained that he's too handsome, but I was never one to bemoan that!!:) Besides, he wouldn't have been considered conventionally handsome in that time-period anyway, neither would Jane. I must say, this was the first rendition I have seen in which both Jane and Rochester appealed to me equally.    The movie as a whole was breathtaking. The scenery, the music, the cast, everything. There was a gothic spooky vibe hanging over the whole thing, which fits the book's gothic themes, and keeps you in suspense throughout. It truly is a beautiful rendition, and very true to the original story for the most part. The only thing that I did not like was the post-wedding scene; in the book Jane wouldn't let Mr. Rochester touch her, being a married man, let alone lie on top of her kissing her passionately. She was just so submissive. Other than that, however, it was wonderful.     Well, this one's for all you worried parents out there, I'd probably give this movie a rating of about PG-13, not only for mature subject matter,[lunatics jumping off of tall buildings, etc.] but also for slight sexual content. Again, sexual content: SLIGHT. It's nothing but kissing, with the occasional lying on top of each other, but everyone's clothes stay on. I heartily recommend this movie to anyone who has read Jane Eyre and become as infatuated with it as I have!!     THE END [ta da!!!]     P.S. Buy the movie.

B001OW5NF0|5.0|Outstanding help. I found TFFP a good source of checkpoints to use when writing, especially when revising a manuscript. I took my copy to the computer to make some stickies with checklists: go back and weed out superfluous adjectives, use metaphors for a quick image, make every verb and adjective precisely right... Pick the tips that will help you the most.  The advice here is practical, not airy theory, and the viewpoint is that of the editors and agents that writers need to impress if they want to publish. If you think you have a good story or an interesting character, be sure to read this... it will tell you what else you need, because a good story is not enough on its own. What's the one thing most likely to send your story to the reject pile... this book will tell you. Worth its price four times over.

B000C20VPA|5.0|Anytime you see that a movie is 3 hours long, you think to yourself that you are in for a long ride. Casino is such a great movie, with a terrific cast, that it's over before you know it. Watching the film makes you realize how great De Niro, Pesci and Stone are as actors. There are just many great scenes where I sat there and thought how brilliant they were. The best scenes are with the dialogue between De and Stone. It is just intersting to watch how just about one arguement can ruin everything for people and causes everyone on top to hit rock bottom. Fanastic acting, I can't say that enough because that is what makes the movie.The movie also does a great job making itself modern even though it takes place during the 70s and 80s. If you are into great films, this one of the best.
0307269191|2.0|This is Murakami Haruki's meditation on running, which seems to be an activity that is just as important to the acclaimed novelist as writing. It is written in his usual writing style, which is casual, comfortable and chatty, and he regularly uses some of his favourite repetition markers, such as \\"as I have already mentioned...\\" and others, phrases that would be a sign of a bad writer or quickly edited out if they weren't coming from a writer as popular and critically-acclaimed as Murakami. The book is largely anecdotal, but also attempts to present big ideas about the meaning of running, the meaning of writing, and the meaning of life. It is as its most enjoyable when it is at its lightest and most shallow, when it describes the look and feel of things and the little patterns and routines of daily life. Ultimately, however, it is a dull and meandering mini-book that is coyly self-referential as it goes through a laundry list of running-related events without any apparent direction, and his attempts at giving some meaning to his running come off as a bit nonsensical. It is often clinical in its description of running, and Murakami actually describes his passion quite passionlessly. Certain passages are better than others, and his description of running on Kauai island in Hawaii makes me want to go there quite badly. He is at his finest when he ruminates on other runners that he admires greatly, and I can feel his frustration at describing the tragic loss of two young runners, newlyweds, in a traffic accident. His description of his life is also quite interesting; his youth as a jazz club owner, his memory of the moment he decided to write a novel and his years as an early writer, his extreme devotion to whatever it is that he is doing, and some aspects of his relatively cosmopolitan lifestyle. And just as much as any writer, you get a good sense from reading this book of how he controls his life-regimen: no more cigarettes, limited drinking, limited diet, in bed before 10 and up before sunrise in order to run and write while the day is still young. It seems like a dull, stoic lifestyle but, ironically, also one that I envy as a fellow writer who is still struggling to publish his first novel and who also counts running as an interest and a preferred activity. Admittedly, I haven't finished reading this book - I read the first half or so while on vacation in Taiwan, staying in a house where someone had a copy of the book - and I might still finish reading it if I ever come across another copy. Like the rest of his books, there's nothing that leads me to believe that anything in the second half will illuminate what is in the first half.ore 10 and up before sunrise in order to run and write while the day is still young.

B0012Q732O|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  If you are a believer in Atlantis or Lemuria than advanced civilizations in prehistoric times would not seem so far fetched, or that \\"gods\\" came from the stars (extraterrestrials), or that the history of humankind as we have been \\"informed\\" is a lie.  I liked all the bc animals...mammoths, sabertooth cat. Liked the spiritual link between the human and animals, and that the tribe was led by a \\"mother goddess high priestess\\".  All together it was a fun, adventurous, good natured movie.  No pointless blood or sex in every scene which I find boring and mind numbing.  I found the story sweet with a charming message that \\"love conquers all\\".  I like any movie that carries a message of heart, courage, brotherhood and love.  Good work movie makers!
B000Y5JFN4|5.0|David, Nigel and Derek - the holy trinity of rock, the founding members of England's loudest band, the poets behind \\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight\\" - are the subjects of the first and still the best mock/rockumentary \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" (a film by Marty Dibergi/Rob Reiner). Following the band on their first U.S. tour in over five years, Dibergi goes where no other filmmaker has gone before - deep inside Tap's history, exploring the lean years (\\"Gimmie Some Money\\"), the innocent years (\\"Cups and Cakes\\"), the psychedelic years (\\"(Listen to the) Flower People\\"), the monolith years (\\"Stonehenge\\") and the then-present years (\\"Hell Hole\\") - while paying respect to all the fallen drummers (R.I.P.) in-between. It's a cross-country roller coaster ride you will never forget. So sit back, relax, turn the volume up to 11, and experience all \\"the sights, the sounds [and] the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road.\\"    While you're at it, mark you calendars for July 14, 2009 - the date when Tap hits Blu-ray for the first time ever. Blu will never be so Black.    \\"It's like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is none. None more black\\" -Nigel Tufnel

B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors' debut album is often described as \\"one of the best debut albums in history,\\" but are ANY rock albums better? \\"The Doors\\" dazzled the world and established the group's unique sound: a blend of sensuous dark rock and blues.  Here, at its best, Doors' music is tightly structured, clear, and fluid -- whether hard driving or eerie.  The music speaks for itself; fuzz boxes need not apply.  Lead singer Jim Morrison's lyrics and the imagery they conjure up are supported by Robby Krieger's aggressive, sometimes sinewy guitar.  But Ray Manzarek's keyboards, mostly organ here, became The Doors' trademark, even as Krieger had more edge.     The 1967 debut has been described as \\"perfect,\\" but it has one so-so track, \\"I Looked at You.\\"  Substitute this CD's 2d bonus track of \\"Moonlight Drive\\" (a little better than 1st) to neatly lead into \\"End of the Night\\":  Perfection would then be achieved using Jim's first-ever composition, but \\"Strange Days\\" would then lose a great song.    The one song Morrison didn't write was the one that blasted the group into prominence. Krieger's \\"Light My Fire\\" is an erotic journey. Ray's solo is majestic and ecstatic, with dramatic cadences. Robby's solo explores the dark underside of consciousness, using a flamenco/latin sound with beautiful high-pitched motifs. John Coltrane's \\"Ole\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\" were influences, but \\"Light My Fire\\" has its own structure and Doors'-infused dynamic tension -- It is The Doors' creation. Let's not forget Jim's terrific opening and finale, either.    The electrifying opener, \\"Break on Through,\\" epitomizes what the group represents. One of the most tightly performed, hard-driving songs ever, it bursts outward in centripetal force, revolving around Jim's verbal invitations to sex and violence, freedom, and mystery.  Morrison's lyrics shine just as much in the second track, \\"Soul Kitchen\\":  \\"The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes/Streetlights shed their hollow glow/Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise/Still one place to go...../Your fingers weave quick minarets/Speak in secret alphabets/I light another cigarette/Learn to forget.\\"  Jim's song lyrics were always much better than his regular poetry.  \\"The Crystal Ship,\\" beautiful and highly evocative, explores fleeting romance within an acid-induced setting.  A lovely piano solo is sandwiched between Jim's fabulous crooning.    The album's theatrical atmosphere is most marked in the next two songs. \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" is an amusing commentary perhaps not restricted to Hollywood starlets, with cool, sarcastic lyrics by Jim joining sexy instrumental crescendos and a very clever pause in the chorus. \\"The Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)\\" is the Doors' catchy interpretation of a tune from Bertolt Brecht's opera \\"The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny,\\" with decadent lyrics. The other cover is Willie Dixon's bluesy \\"Back Door Man,\\" in which The Doors heavily adapt the structure to fit Jim's dramatic needs and forceful singing.    In \\"End of the Night,\\" the group invokes the dark themes of French writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine, again relying on Krieger's high-pitched guitar twangs in support of Morrison's dark journey down an endless highway to the \\"Bright Midnight.\\" The un-Doors-like \\"Take It as It Comes\\" has an optimistic tone (but Robby insists Jim wrote the verse and lyrics), featuring swirling keyboards by Ray.  I feel \\"The End\\" is overrated, notably the Oedipal section, but its atmosphere forever clarifies that The Doors' Hearts are in Darkness.

0061134007|5.0|Let me say from the start that this is one of the best thrillers that I have read for a while.<br />Nesbo tells us in 10 parts and 107 short chapters a complex, but never confused story about old and new nazis of Norway, of collaborators during the German occupation, Waffen SS volunteers on the Eastern Front against Russia, and neo-Nazis in the Norway of today (of which there were exactly 57 in 2000, not all of which survive the story).<br /><br />The triangle legend of David/Uriah/Bathsheba is replayed twice in this scenario, once in a wartime hospital in Vienna, and once in modern day Oslo.<br />Another main suspense driver is the identity question of the older generation, the survivors of WW2.  Is everyone who he claims to be? Are all players still running under their original names? How do you reliably distinguish between traitors, resistance fighters, double agents, change-overs, impostors?<br />The good old red herring of the multiple personality disorder is used effectively for the confusion of the superficial reader (and amazon reviewer).<br /><br />The structure is elegant and functional. One might benefit from further analysis of its components. In terms of suspense there is little that can surpass chapter 50. If you want a spoiler for yourself, just look at that.<br /><br />Since this is a part of the Harry Hole series, Nesbo has the problem that the story overlaps partly with prequels and sequels, but there is no need to stick to the sequence of the series; understanding is not impeded by not really knowing what happened earlier.<br />Pity that only 2 of the 6 (?) Hole novels are available now in English editions. That means I have to go to the German edition.

B0000509C4|5.0|Creepshow 2: Movie Review<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />...O.K., it's not so scary that you'll stay up at night, but the three tales included are creepy in their own fun little way. Stephen King [who, in case anyone doesn't know, (but should know, you're not a horror fan if you don't!) wrote such novels as [[ASIN:0451161351 Cujo (Signet)]], [[ASIN:0743437497 The Shining]], [[ASIN:0743210891 The Green Mile : The Complete Serial Novel]]...I could go on for a long time] and George Romero (you have to be kidding me if you don't know him and his world-famous zombie movies: [[ASIN:B0013D8LAE Night of the Living Dead]],  [[ASIN:B0002IQNAG Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)]], Day of the Dead, [[ASIN:B000B2YR7Y George A. Romero's Land of the Dead (Unrated Director's Cut)]], and, most recently, [[ASIN:B0013D8LA4 George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead]]) have teamed up to make a sequel to [[ASIN:0790744295 Creepshow]], (which I haven't seen...yet) and they've done it in such a great fashion that you think you're actually in an `80's horror comic. Each story plays like a full movie, and guess what? That means three times the fun and terror...<br /><br />The first of these tales, \\"Ol Chief Woodenhead\\", is a perfect way to start the movie, it being the best of the trio. An old shopkeeper living in a town that has long since died still remains loyal to his store, along with his life-size model of an Indian Chief, despite his wife's protests to sell the place. He refuses, the store has kept money in his pockets; he can't give it up now. Besides, he has ties with the town and its Indian tribe living in the outskirts, they owe him some money. The local Indian Chief soon shows up, and he comes bearing the tribe's greatest and most prized possessions, for the old shop owner to keep for now, until the tribe has collected enough money to pay him in cash. After much arguing, the shopkeeper reluctantly agrees to take it, therefore honoring the tribe. But trouble soon follows, as three robbers, one of them even one of the tribe, steal the treasures. They make off literally like bandits, and each goes quickly back to their homes to get ready to leave to Hollywood with their money. But they're not going anywhere if `Ol Chief Woodenhead can stop it...Coming to life and stepping off the porch he stood on for all those years, he grips his axe and gets ready to do what needs to be done..Not scary, but great story-telling! Grade: A<br /><br />The next tale, \\"The Raft\\" pits spring-breakers against a man-eating oil slick, and you have to wonder which one came up with the idea, SK or GR. The teens, in college, park their car by an isolated lake, and, seeing a lone raft in the middle of the lake, decide to hop in and swim to it. But one of them sees something in the lake (the oil slick) drag down a duck, and \\"eat\\" it. Fearful, they start to get scared. And that's when the first one dies. The slick, which is very hungry, (I don't think the duck filled it up) wraps around her leg (the first one to die) and pulls her off the raft, dragging her under. Did I mention that the slick can \\"move\\" around the lake, following food? The only problem I had with this one was that the oil slick looked pretty fake at times, and the whole plot got kind of cheesy at times too. Still, creepy and well thought out. Grade: A-<br /><br />The last tale, \\"The Hitch-Hiker\\" just falls short of the par that the first two were on. A woman driving down the streets of lonely `ol Maine has thought on other things, like coming up with an excuse for being late coming home, (she's having an affair, and forgot the time to come home to her husband, who's never late coming home) hits a hitch-hiker, killing him. After seeing the damage, (to the hitch-hiker and her fancy expensive car) she decides to just drive away, or, do a hit-and-run. But the hitchhiker, who's still dead, has other plans for her...But the plan for this tale just isn't as great as the first two tales. I think the story isn't as good as the first two, (a lack of imagination for Stephen King? That's a first!!!) and in the end it just didn't click. It was still pretty good though, and the ending makes it worthwhile. Grade: B-<br /><br />To put the cherry on the top, all of this is wrapped around an animated tale of a boy and his comic. The art looks great, and in the end the whole movie is great, with minor flaws, mostly in the special effects department; the acting was good, for the most part. An excellent nod to the eighties, and plain out horror in general.ion for Stephen King? That's a first!!!) and in the end it just didn't click.

B0013LL2Z2|5.0|In hindsight, this movie can be credited as one of the first cyberpunk movies ever made, and it's also a testament of how rigid the rating system for movies has become at present.  Logan's Run was rated PG back in 1976 and includes nudity (almost full-frontal, no less) from Jenny Agutter in one scene, plus the clothes she wears are pretty much transparent throughout; you'd never see that in one of today's PG-rated films.<br /><br />The next few paragraphs contain spoilers of the plot, so for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, you might want to skip over.  I've never read the novel it's based on, but the premise of the movie is pretty unique, considering.  About 300 years in the future, the whole of civilization is contained inside one huge domed city, with the ruins surrounding it the result of some apocalyptic event.  Life inside the city is utopic.  There are no worries beyond choosing what you're going to do with your free time.  There are drugs.  There's sex with no commitment (indeed, any kind of emotional attachment is looked on as an aberration).  There's getting a different face at the local New You bodysculpting kiosk.  Everything is provided for you by the computer mainframe that runs the city.  There is no crime, save one.  Running.<br /><br />You see, the price for this kind of carefree existence is that your life ends when you turn thirty.  In an effort to maintain population control, the mainframe has conditioned people to accept their thirtieth birthday as 'Lastday' and present themselves for a special celebration called Carousel where they 'renew' and start life over.  People know when their time arrives when a small crystal imbedded in the palm of their hand begins flashing.<br /><br />Certain individuals rebel against this and they've formed an underground movement with the ankh (the ancient Egyptian symbol of eternal life) as their icon.  They don't believe in the myth of Carousel and they choose to run instead.  The Sandmen, the only real police force the city has, exist specifically to hunt these Runners down and eliminate them.  The main character of the movie is Logan 5, a Sandman, who is perfectly content with his job hunting Runners with his friend, until he meets up with Jessica 6, played by Jenny Agutter, who has one of the underground's ankhs in her possession.  The mainframe then chooses him to infiltrate the underground movement and eliminate it from the inside.  The incentive it gives him is by taking away his remaining time, forcibly turning him into a Runner.  He begins to question everything he's been taught to believe after teaming up with Agutter's character to escape the city.  Through their journey, being pursued all the while by Logan's Sandman friend, they discover a rather chilling side to both the city itself and the society within it.<br /><br />Outside the city they come across something they've never witnessed before, a man who's lived long enough to be in his dotage (played convincingly by Peter Ustinov of 'Spartacus' fame).  They bring him back to the city, where Logan is captured and brought before the mainframe computer for questioning.  The computer cannot reconcile his answers with the information it possesses and self destructs.  Logan then reveals the Old Man to the rest of society, letting them know they don't have to die.  People are then free to make their own decisions and live life as they see fit.  End of story.<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />This movie was one of the first to portray the dangers of what civilization could become.  At first glance, everything might seem to be bliss, but the degree to which everything has become impersonalized and controlled and how de-valued the individual has become in the story is really rather frightening.  Look at society today.  Companies now refer to us as 'human resources' rather than personnel, willing to cut 25,000 jobs here and 50,000 jobs there, calling it a 'business decision' and leaving many people on theverge of homelessness.  Political correctness is currently all the rage.  Computers are taking a much more prominent role in our personal lives than ever before.  With our current 'entitlement' attitude, we pretty much insist on having everything set before us on a silver platter and complain LOUDLY when it isn't.  Don't think.  Exist.  We are now SO content to let others handle our personal responsibilities that Logan's Run has almost a prophetic air to it.  The one difference is that our lives don't currently have a time limit.<br /><br />Yet...<br /><br />This vision alone puts it up there as one of the classics of the day.  I'm also not taking off any marks for the 1970s special effects.  They may seem incredibly dated today, but they were considered good at the time.  They just didn't have access to CGI.  Also, the dialogue and the acting were par for the course for the time period so I'm giving that high marks, too.  The movie was also popular enough to spawn a short-lived television series.  The series was rather more cinematic than the movie in scope, considering some of the creatures the trio of adventurers comes across, but it was still entertaining in its own way.<br /><br />All in all, Logan's Run was a movie with a VERY powerful message behind it, and it is one worth listening to.  Keep an open mind and you might enjoy it.  And before you think of jumping the gun and trashing Logan's Run because it WAS a cheesy 1976 sci-fi flick, movie producer Joel Silver likes this show enough to be pushing to direct a new version of it.

All in all, Logan's Run was a movie with a VERY powerful message behind it, and it is one worth listening to.  Keep an open mind and you might enjoy it.  And before you think of jumping the gun and trashing Logan's Run because it WAS a cheesy 1976 sci-fi flick, movie producer Joel Silver likes this show enough to be pushing to direct a new version of it.  Two thumbs up.
1577314808|3.0|The author acknowledges that this knowledge is derived from many ancient sources, Hindus, Buddhists, the Chinese, the Bible etc.  But his examples are poor and difficult to follow.  At some points he expresses anger at the harm the human race has done to fellow humans and the planet.  This appears contradictory when his message is to \\"observe oneself as if detached\\" - in which case you would apply no blame and feel no anger.    Simply put, the author is re-wording ancient wisdom that says:    Be objective in your awareness.  By being objective you have detached yourself from the situation and hence will not feel anger, hate, jealousy and countless other emotions that would have flooded you had you been subjective.  By being objective you will be clear minded and make the right decision.  Had you stayed subjective, you would make an emotionally clouded judgment simply to satisfy your ego.  And the best way to be objective is to be selfless in all actions.    And so I give this book a thumbs up as a contribution to a more positive humanity but I feel the author could have simplified his message and presented better examples to make the truth more concrete.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I had heard a grand total of two JM songs before buying this album: Say and Waiting on the World to Change. I wasn't planning on buying the album, but I randomly found it at a used book sale for two dollars. What a steal! Still not so sure, I listened to it half heartedly. It was amazing! The perfect blend of rock, pop, even blues. The album has grown on me a ton. I paid two dollars then, but I would easily pay twenty for it now. Since purchasing, I have purchased several other JM albums, all of which are amazing. One last note: I have more than 4000 songs in my iTunes library from more than thirty different genres, and I can easily say that, no question, John Mayer is my favorite artist.

The band is tight, the songs are cookin' and Nuno is leading the charge. If you like the funk rock guitar licks of Stevie Salas you'll dig this disc. If you can't rock to this then you just can't rock!<br />[...]

0060558121|1.0|I have been a big fan of Gaiman. I started out with Neverwhere and loved it, then I read Anansi Boys, and The graveyard book and thought they were good. Good Omens was fairly good, but American Gods, this book is horribly painfully boring. I am dumb struck that with over seven hundred ratings it averages 4 stars.<br /><br /> Not only is the book boring, it's filled with cheap sexual content that does very little to enhance the story. I'm no prune, but having Gaiman describe the taste of a man's semen in another man's mouth, yea I could have done without that description and visual, Thanks. Still that's not why I rate this book so badly, the story just goes no where, you get endless descriptions of towns, and signs, and what the main protagonist is eating, how crappy and cold the weather is, and who they meet in each town. The main characters Shadow and Wednesday are boring, dull and lifeless. I made it to page 200 out of 460, and gave up (a first for me). I kept reading thinking it's got to get better, if the author wasn't Gaiman I would have given up at a hundred pages. If you're new to Gaiman don't start with this book, start with Neverwhere. It is so much better that I can't believe the same man wrote both books. If you decide to read this book prepare to be bored to death.
0525951113|5.0|The future cometh  Daniel Suarez first novel is a blockbuster.  5+ stars.  I heard Mr. Suarez on a \\"talking heads\\" pundit, cable TV show and was extremely impressed with his intellect and knowledge of the future of cyberspace.  He painted a rather frightening picture of the future as it pertains to computers and cyber terror.   As a computer layman I was impressed enough with Mr. Suarez that I immediately obtained his book to investigate his views.  I was amazed and duly impressed with not only his insights but also his fluid, crisp, tight writing style.  As a computer layman, I was a little worried that this would be one of those \\"for geeks only\\" books, but again I was pleasantly surprised at how Mr. Suarez wrote in an easy to understand style that even someone like me could understand.   He explained techno computerese so that it all made sense and flowed in a very logical and meaningful way.  Good job Mr. Suarez.    The story line is interesting and intricate.  It involves the world of computers and how they can be \\"harvested\\" for both good and evil.  There is an amazing cast of characters which adds depth to the story without encumbering it.  The plot centers on a legendary computer game designer, Matthew Sobol, whose premature death activates a previously dormant computer program that initiates a chain of events that unravels the hyper-efficient, interconnected computer world of today.  \\"Things\\" begin to happen and soon factions are drawn up on both the \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" side of the battle.  The only trouble is what is good and what is evil?  That in many ways is left up to the reader.  And that makes the story all that more delicious.  I was enthralled with Daemon and could not put the book down.  Although intricate and complex, it is an amazing tale of what could be, and how that \\"could be\\" could happen.  Again it is not a geek computer story but a well done throughout tale of futurism involving computers.  It is not sci-fi but reality with a twist.    Character development was superb and meaningful.  Each character grew into their own skin as Mr. Suarez took them from introduction to full blown maturity.  Excellent in-depth character development.  No gratuitous sex or language.  There is some cyber violence but it is germane to the story and not overly done.    Must read.  One of the best books so far in 2009.  It appears Mr. Suarez's follow-up novel Freedom  (estimated out in 2010) will be a continuation of this story.  The ending of Daemon certainly points in that direction.  I certainly hope so, for if that novel is as good as this one we are in for a literary tour de force treat.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Clint Eastwood confronts, with the power of an old man who has not lost his memory of the crimes of the Korean War generation, what those crime have transformed him into: a racist, self-centered, extremely bitter person who has become a recluse in his self-righteous expiation of his past, and this expiation takes the color of the total rejection of anything that is not white and wrapped up in an American flag, not seeing that this turns the flag into a shroud, the shroud of all the basic principles of these United States of America. But Clint Eastwood is a man of epiphanies. So he works an epiphany out of this horror. His neighbors are from a Laotian tribe that fought with the Americans in Vietnam against the Communists. Circumstances bring the young boy of this family to trying to steal, on the order from a gang of young people of this community, the Gran Torino collectible car of our Kowalski. Of course he is interrupted and yet spared a bullet that would have killed him. Why? Because Kowalski had done that, had killed a young boy, one day in Korea and that crime is still haunting him. Circumstances will lead him to helping that boy and his sister out of difficult situations with that gang but also with some blacks. He does that on the spur of the moment and along the line of his long cultivated guilt that has to find a salvation after the death of his wife and the discovery that he is spitting blood and probably has lung cancer since he is a heavy smoker. The gang though does not take an intimidation for an answer and certainly not for a final and uncrossable warning. So they go further in their victimizing that boy and girl from next door, a lot farther, and Kowalski take the case in his own hands, at night when he is sure the whole nest of killing predators will be assembled and he comes out of the night, on their front lawn, with dozens of witnesses all around to provoke them into killing him, in fact over-killing him and thus freeing him from his guilt and his disease and at the same time bringing the whole gang down for quite a long time. The best part of this film is the giving away of his possession before and after his death. He dares give his silver star to the young Hmong boy Tao before dying,  and will his home to the church of the young Irish priest that had forced him into a sacrificial and Christian attitude and his Gran Torino to Tao again. Clint Eastwood in his old age seems to be cleaning up his own house and home, I mean his American mind and soul and that great Spring clearance takes the form of an admirable and at times compassionate or pathetic sidewalk confession and garage expiation. And that is so reassuring about the transformation that is taking place in the USA right now under our eyes, watered that it has been and still is by the blood of millions more victims, US or not, of two more wars in two more foreign countries that had asked nothing.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDs disease and at the same time bringing the whole gang down for quite a long time.

0066620996|3.0|Good to Government Cheese.  Well, the jury is no longer out.  What was thought to have worked 20 or 30 years ago may not be all it was cracked up to be.  \\"The bus\\" analogy appears to have been a recipe for creating a completely narcissistic, homogenous company lacking the ability to see outside of their own contrived success.  Can you say Logan's Run?  Collins offers plenty of good advice however; I think we can all agree that the \\"BEST\\" people do not always create the best company.  Simply throwing people off the bus is not necessarily change for the better.

0452289963|5.0|I first read this book in, I guess it was 2005. I was at the tail-end of a fairly traumatic life-experience where I had lost just about eveything I had, and had not dealt with it well personally. I was full of blame, criticism, doubt about myself and the future. I began the book, knew it was important, but didn't really pay enough attention to see myself in it. Eventually I picked up the book  again --and had a kind of \\"awakening.\\"<br />Put simply, I believe this book is divinely inspired. There is not one superfluous line in it. In my opinion it is probably one of the most important books of our lifetimes. (Apparently Oprah Winfrey thought so too, since she sponsored the well-attended 10 week world-wide web sessions with Tolle about the book.)<br />I don't think we are all on the same \\"path\\" in life, and I suppose we ask different questions about why we are here and why we face the personal challenges each of us has to face. If we \\"ask\\" at all!  So the book may not be for everybody. I do know that if you look at yourself and see a pattern of struggles with life, unhappiness, self-doubt, seeming inability to \\"create\\" what you want in life, or just feel unease with life in general these days (as so many seem to), it is well worth reading this book. The notion of remaining quiet and still, identifying ego when it is attempting its assertion of control, connecting with that indefinable all-that-is force that we are ultimately a part of, is a \\"solution\\" for me and apparently for many many others. This book is about becoming conscious; about awakening to why we are here on earth. It is assisting us in what I believe is an emerging  \\"new energy,\\" (example: global economic changes)  which demand new behaviors, new attitudes, and new self-awareness from each of us.  It is rare to be able to say \\"this book changed my life\\", but I can say that about this book! I expect it will survive for many generations to come. Needless to say I highly recommend it.
B0000844I8|4.0|I much prefer this movie over any of the \\"stargate\\" TV series spin-offs. I like the originality of the story, the special effects, and some of the character interaction.    I give it 4 stars because, as is often the case, Sci-Fi movies suffer from a lack of excellent screenplay and acting.    Neverthless, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, this movie should be in your collection.    Recommended!

031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than all the rest. It was tension and great anticipation from the very beginning. Great dynamics between the vampires and werewolves, what a great idea of them actually teaming up to beat EVIL in two different waves; first the young vampires and then the Volturi. Absolutely fascinating with the introduction of the baby/child of Edward and Bella, the teaming up of vampires from around the world and their various characterizations, the excrutiating pregancy and changeover of Bella to a vampire and her transformation to a \\"vampire superhero\\" I loved this book and could almost not put it down. I am sure that it is maybe not a literary work of art and probably has some flaws, but it was a great ride of thriller, adventure, romance, tragedy all rolled into one. I am so sad that I am done. I miss them so much, but I bought the movie today, so I am reunited with them all once again. Hurray!!!!!!!!!

B0002B15XI|1.0|I was hugely dissapointed in this film, which I purchased soley on my love of the television series.  What a mistake.  While it makes a nice edition to my collection, up there on the shelf with my M*A*S*H Season 1 thru 11 boxes, it is likely that I'll never watch it again.  To be honest, I can't even really say that I watched it once; I stopped the film about 15 minutes after the whole \\"Frank and Hot Lips over the P.A.\\" bit.  It was just becoming to painful to watch. This film has found a home on my list of \\"Most Over-rated\\", right along with The Godfather and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.    I do not mean this review to disparage fans of the movie in any way.  My main point here is that I grew up watching the TV show and, after that, the movie just didn't cut it.  My biggest complaint is that the jokes and pranks played by Hawkeye and Co. aren't fun and ultimately harmless as they are in the series; the characters as they are portrayed here are sexist, childish, and mean-spirited.  The silver lining? Except for the presence of Gary Burgoff as Radar, the movie is so completely disconnected from the series that it in no way affects my love for the TV show.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|I'll never understand why people think Wes Anderson writes/directs \\"comedies\\". He certainly likes to make fun of the human condition, as well as foibles and short-comings which are, let's face it, amusing. I disagree with most of the other reviews, but all I can say is that I think Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson presented very individual agendas. Wilson as the control freak annoyed me for a while, until a bigger picture developed. I was entertained and amused, and \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" was everything I would expect from a Wes Anderson film. The appearance of Anjelica Huston toward the end was accompanied by a Rolling Stones tune, which made you believe that these guys had found what they were looking for.Wes Anderson is not simplistic; indeed, I was moved and never bored by this episodic adventure. I love his choice of music. The DVD extras were few, but included \\"Hotel Chevalier\\", a sort of preface to Jack's character (Schwartzman), with Natalie Portman (not in the actual film). The \\"making-of\\" segment was actually about the making-of; no interviews with cast or director. Bummer.  Sorry, but I enjoyed it a whole lot.

1582701709|1.0|I am a firm believer in the significance of psychology regarding human achievement.  My own experience has taught me that often what we focus our mind on we tend to bring about, a concept similar to the notion that repetition brings about skill.  The Secret is perhaps the most horrendous depiction of these powers of thought that I have encountered as it focuses on the lowest common denominator, is filled with inconstancies, wreaks of arrogance, and advocates an approach that deems results more worthy than personal responsibility.<br /><br />LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR<br />The authors suggest that what you think about is what you attract; a reasonable suggestion on it own.  However, they assert that this principle, by means of the \\"law of attraction\\" is an absolute, that what you think will always come to you.  This line of reasoning would suggest that many noteworthy cult members should presently be riding a comet through the universe (are there any other groups as committed to one way of thinking?).  Anyone who has ever successfully paid off debt, by the reasoning given by the law of attraction, would have only amassed more debt rather than having paid it off.<br /><br />The law of attraction as an absolute cheapens the notion that success also involves numerous attributes.  To pay off debt, one often needs the discipline to change their spending habits, not just mere thoughts.  To train for a marathon, one must be persistent in preparation.  Success typically includes a strong work ethic, dedication, passion, all which stem from thought, yet all of which thought alone will not construct.<br /><br />The Secret is an attractive message to many because it is the easiest of all the traits to gain.  One who otherwise might not have the inner discipline to utilize the other traits mentioned would immediately find the idea of only needing to think properly very attractive.  It can be difficult to work hard, it is often demanding to persevere, it can be strenuous to remain dedicated to a goal, but it is not hard to think.<br /><br />This book caters to those seeking the easy route rather than the best route - which I expect significantly contributed to its sales figures.  The Secret says little of action, resulting in a book for dreamers, not doers.<br /><br />INCONSISTANCIES<br />The authors all insist on never focusing on the negative.  Yet on page 135, they discuss how all diseases are curable by thought, noting that at some point in time, every so called incurable disease has been cured.  To work on finding those cures, someone had to have focused on the disease.  The irony was clearly lost on the authors as those who focused on curing those diseases, by the law of attraction, should have been expected to acquire the disease since this was their dominating thoughts.  The authors suggest that a clear break from focusing on the negative is essential for success; yet preparation without consideration for all possible outcomes is reckless, and only is practical in fantasy.<br /><br />On page 13, Bob Doyle says, \\"The law of attraction doesn't care whether you perceive something to be good or bad.  It's responding to your thoughts.\\"  On page 34, Bob Doyle then says, \\"You're getting exactly what you are feeling about, not so much what you are thinking about.\\"  It would seem one of the key authors cannot make up his mind regarding the importance of thoughts.<br /><br />On Page 9, Byrne says, \\"The law responds to your thoughts no matter what they may be.\\" Yet on page 28, Byrne then says, \\"by the law of attraction, they (those with negative results) had to be on the same frequency as the event, it doesn't necessarily mean they thought of that exact event.\\" Even Byrne cannot seem to make up her mind about what the law means.<br /><br />ARROGANCE<br />The authors lump the law of attraction in with in nature's laws to imply it is science and an absolute.  Although science is broad, there is a clear consensus among all scientists on the scopeof most known laws of nature (those unknown being considered theory, not factual).  Unless the authors purport to be scientists themselves (their biographies at the end of the book say otherwise), then speaking as though there is a scientific consensus regarding the law of attraction is nothing more than blatant propaganda intended to impress the naïve.<br /><br />On page 21, Bob Proctor writes, \\"If you don't understand the law that doesn't mean you should reject it.  You may not understand electricity, and yet you enjoy the benefits of it.\\" This statement implies the veracity of the law of attraction is on the same basis as electricity, which discounts that electricity is actually fully understood by many, easily accessible for study by anyone curious, and verified with both mathematics and testing.  The law of attraction offers nothing of the sort.  Proctor's lack of ability to explain electricity has no relevance, yet his lack of understanding and background regarding the laws of nature are evident, leaving him with only circumstantial explanations; hardly anything to be equated with the known laws of nature.<br /><br />On page 9 John Assaraf asserts, \\"What most people don't understand is that thought has a frequency\\", which should leave one wondering what in fact John Assaraf understands, considering his bio in the rear of the book describes him as a business coach, not a scientist.  If John Assaraf has an understanding of thought based on scientific studies that surpass the world's top scientists, perhaps he would be better served sharing his research, not his condescension.<br /><br />On page 59, Byrne states that, \\"Food cannot cause you to put on weight, unless you think it can.\\"  Is anyone honestly supposed to take such statements seriously?  Is Byrne so confident in her beliefs to take up a challenge of eating 10 pounds of bacon for 30 straight days and not put on weight?<br /><br />RESULTS OVER PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY<br />The Secret speaks little of taking action, leaving one with the impression that thought is so all encompassing that one could just sit on their couch and think their way into all their desires.  If such reasoning resonates with you, you may want to assess whether your belief system is set up to justify your laziness.<br /><br />It is human nature to desire instant gratification; yet the law of attraction takes this one step further to suggest not only can you have anything you want, but now you do not need to even do anything beyond thinking to get it.  This mindset is not only unproductive, it is down right destructive.  One need only look to those with significant credit card debt to discover the danger of focusing only on the means of acquiring material goods - the law of attraction would suggest the means are the only importance, but reality clearly shows that a blind eye to consequences is irresponsible.<br /><br />On page 105 Byrne suggests, \\"The only difference between you and them (the wealthy) is that they thought the thoughts to bring the wealth to them.\\"  I will not discount the value of proper thinking, however, the notion that any successful endeavor is a result of only thoughts, completely discounting action, risk, ingenuity, among many other attributes, will leave any enthusiast of the law of attraction seriously lacking and completely disillusioned.<br /><br />The entire book is based upon inconsistent and terribly faulty lines of reasoning, and caters to those seeking an easy answer in lieu of a practical and honest dose of reality.

B000025H0Q|5.0|Nick Drake was a selfless songwriter.His own identidy on this planet meant less to him than his music did.When his music failed to find an audience all that was left was the feeling \\"of a remnant of something that's passed\\".It is hard for me to be judgemental on someone for his possible suicide when you listen to the man's music and find that person put all of his very existence into his songs.Not that it would have been the right thing to do,but the amount of healing thru song this man left on all three of his album's is a lifetime's worth.Bryter Layer is probably my favorite one as it still has the feeling of someone who hopes to reach people which is hard to find on his last album \\"Pink Moon\\",which is quite a personal album(Though still a masterpiece).Even the instrumental's are stunningly good.His piano playing is both tasteful and subtle at the same time,which leads me to suspect he may have been just as gifted a pianist as he was a guitarist,but may have been disciplined enough of a songwriter not to overdo anything,which is why all of his song's sound so sculpted and finished.He used his instumental gifts to showcase his poetic whisper of a voice.When I look back on his work's the last thing that comes to  mind is wasted talent,but on the contrary talent that was recognized,used with all humbleness,and just never appreciated.The beauty in it all is that we still have his album's to find him immortalized.Nick Drake is \\"The sweet breeze felt in the top of a tree\\" and the breeze hold's enough beauty to \\"Brighten\\" anyone's \\"Northern Sky\\".What an artist!
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Kudos! This has to be one of the most charming, original, unique and unusual vampire films I have ever seen. Based on the Swedish bestselling novel by John Lindqvist, this remarkable fairy tale-like story takes place in a suburb of Stockholm, Sweden during the early but drab 1980's when Sweden was still heavily influenced by the Soviet bloc. This drab, bleak, wintry landscape becomes the background for a terrific suspense horror story involving two 12 year old Swedish children as they explore and discover their existential lives, confront their own demons both literally and figuratively, and their relationship with each other amidst their own pre adolescent growing pangs. It's a novel coming of age love story in a macabre sort of way as 2 children form a most unlikely alliance in their mutual affection and self-preservation against a hostile social environment.<br />Oskar is the brunt of cruel and mean school bullies who use almost every opportunity possible to persecute him while Lia, a new neighbor, has a vampire nature and requires a fresh homo-sapien food supply that pits her against civil Swedish society in order for her to maintain her physical life and existence. Everything works together in this film to create a haunting and mysterious backdrop to this fairy tale of 2 children dealing with finding their place in the world and ultimately in each other's hearts.<br />From an artistic point of view, the directing, cinematography, acting, soundtrack are superb. The supernatural ambiance is magically interlaced with the mundane and the macabre. The child actors playing the 2 main characters of Oskar and Lia are natural and gifted in their abilities to pull off the complex roles  they perform with such sophisticated grace and nuance. They are entirely believable and unforgettable ! Brilliant acting debut performances by these 2 young children, ages 11 and 12 at the time of filming. Regrettably, Magnolia film distributor, chose to go with amateur, crude subtitles that do not capture the essence or nuance of the actual dialogue as seen at the theater. English dubbing is decent however, and helps even when watching this film in subtitles to preserve the original dialogue. Eventually we will see this movie re released with the original theatrical subtitles. For now I would not let these inferior subtitles deter anyone from enjoying this fine film especially if dubbing and subtitles are employed together and simultaneously.<br />Although this is a superb horror film, it lacks the gratuitous blood and gore of many Hollywood horror movies and does not need to rely on alot of special effects to distract one from the real story. Although this vampire character deviates from the classic Hollywood stereotype in a number of ways, the result is a more contemporary and compelling and heroic vampire figure and story. Seldom if ever, have I ever felt empathy for a vampire in an authentic sort of way. Lia, although a little demon, is at once both lovable and innocent. One may find a few scenes somewhat disturbing, but overall 'Let the Right One In' is a creatively made artsy vampire film that aspires to something beyond itself. It is hard not to compare this film to an Ingmar Bergman masterpiece in its existential authenticity. Although it is technically a vampire movie as well, this prepubescent child vampire is crisp, refreshing and original breaking the Hollywood stereotypes and molds. Unlike a mediocre vampire flick like Twilight, this vampire tale is unpretentious and non-manipulated and the vampire protagonist in this story has autheniticity, depth, innocence, complexity without the libido and erotic undertones found in so many familiar worn-out vampire tales. Neither can she be categorized as a classic \\"villain\\" in spite of her carnivorous appetite and taste to feed on homo-sapiens. She manages to retain a precarious innocence even as an demon avenger.<br />Be sure to watch this Swedish cinematic gem before the Hollywood remake is released in 2010. This story has an uniquely Swedish flavor and ambiance that is sure to be lost as Hollywood diligently dumbs down this amazing movie to placate an American audience complete with hyperactive special effects and computer graphics. Any Hollywood remake is bound to lack the originality, authenticity and creativity of this independent foreign movie full of nuance and Swedish atmospheric effects.<br />One of the themes of this film is 'revenge and love' and along with Luc Besson's Angel-A, it has to be one of my favorites along this line. This is a movie you may potentially desire to watch over and over again as it has a depth and artistic creativity  seldom seen in generic vampire movies. This film is destined to capture the hearts of many and become an international cult classic.

0790734850|5.0|The biggest disappointment about this movie is the fact that it didn't grab \\"Best Picture\\" at the Oscars... but then, it was going up against \\"Titanic\\". As it was, Kim Basinger won \\"Best Supporting Actress\\", and Brian Helgeland won \\"Best Adapted Screenplay\\". At that, the movie was robbed.<br /><br />Three cops - each with a different style. Kevin Spacey as the 'seen it all' cop who's just looking for another buck. Russell Crowe as the strong-arm who's starting to question the ethics of beating the crap out of people. Guy Pearce as the idealistic newcomer who thinks police work should be clean and neat. Combine those three with a case of gansters and corruption in 1950's L.A., and you have one hell of a movie.<br /><br />It seems confusing at first, but it all comes together - the corruption, the crooked cops, the bad cops trying to do right... it has all of the elements, and it does it well. You'll find yourself drawn in, following the three cops - as well as the call girl (Kim Basinger), the corrupt police captain (James Cromwell), the tabloid reporter ahead of his time (Danny DeVito), and the millionaire who will make a buck any way he can (David Strathairn) - in their quest to solve what seems at first to be a simple murder... or rather, several different murders that are all interconnected.<br /><br />If you love some excellent film making, if you've got half a brain, you're going to love \\"L.A. Confidential\\".

B000QUEHOO|5.0|\\"Collapse - How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" should be required reading for all voters, parents, politicians, CEO's, managers, and anyone influencing decisions about land, forests, or fisheries. Diamond takes us on a tour-de-force of ancient and modern cultures. He draws on the findings of archeology, political science, and history to examine societies, like Easter Island, that have failed; and others, Tikopia, which have persisted for thousands of years. The lessons he presents us with are clear and compelling. He encourages readers to be very careful both with who they vote for and how they spend their money. Each of these actions helps to determine whether our societies will fail or succeed. He further encourages us to take a look at our values and cultural norms and how they contribute to societal outcomes. And he encourages each of us to take action--by praising politicians and businesses that make sustainable choices and writing letters and protesting when they do not.
0316779237|4.0|Okay, so there's no way anyone can say this author doesn't possess that gusty type of humor. No way! SantaLand Diaries, I remembered being the reason Sedaris's name stayed penned in my memory as `that gusty humorous author.'<br /><br />But I stopped cold with Season's Greetings... thank God it wasn't as long as SantaLand... which made it difficult to laugh getting through the Christmas Whore. Season's Greeting literally made me sick to my stomach. Ridiculing the Vietnamese girl and her language, yet leaving a child in her care, the dryer, the legal scuffle... My God! ...Why was this story even included!?! But least I stop and digress as enough people have already pronounced their displeasure here...<br /><br />To conclude, struggling as I did getting through the whore to actually get back to the chuckle bubbles that kept erupting in SantaLand, I eventually recognized what makes Sedaris an attention grabbing name.<br /><br />Let's see: \\"...industrial-strength lasagna,\\"... \\"pea-sized conscience\\"... \\"...wrong-headed and pointless\\" ... \\"disposable boats, ultrasuede basketballs...\\" --these unsullied phrases are littered throughout the book. As noted above, I am finicky and draw lines quickly where it concerns children, but Front Row Center... I cried laughing! I mean come on now, comparing bad entertainment to treating cancer early, that's just over the top brilliant humor... and a bit clique I must add.<br /><br />Saved for the stories pulled from the dark side of someone's traumatizing suffering, the way Sedaris lays humor on paper otherwise is among the cleverest in this time!
B001FBSMF8|5.0|bravo to chris cornell for trying something different, in this day of cookie cutter music. this is the first \\"album\\" i have heard in a long time, and what i mean by that is that you can listen to this album from front to back and it feels like a cohesive piece of work. this is not soundgarden, this is not audioslave, and this is not euphoria morning. all of those groups = amazing. if you are going to dismiss this album beause it sounds nothing like superunknown, then i just feel bad that you cannot open your mind enough to enjoy an amazing piece of music. from the pulsating rhythyms, cornless always peerless lyrics, to tims peerless production, this album is a classic from start to finish. my suggestion? throw this in the deck and go for a long drive and just get lost in the music. again bravo CC

If you have an interest in the construction of clothes and its history, either for professional or personal reasons, you probably know the books by Janet Arnold. And if you don't, you should.     They are a feast to the eyes - if only for the sheer beauty of her detailed drawings - and offer a wealth of practical information on the construction of clothes and their patterns, but also on lovely little dressmaker's secrets (did you know that making a hole for an eyelet will give a better result if you don't cut the fabric, but push the threads aside, preferably with a tool made of horn? A photograph of such a tool is shown, plus an explanation of why this kind of tool is so particularly useful).     There is a beautiful pattern of a boothose (a kind of stocking made of linen fabric), really stunning in its simplicity.     47 of the 128 pages are filled with photographs in colour, many of them in close up, showing you details you could otherwise only see if you held the actual garment in your hand.     What more can I say? It is a treasure. Every book of Janet Arnold's that I open is my favourite for that moment, but this volume is perhaps my most favourite of them all.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Let the Right One In is highly original. For some reason I hadn't realized it was based on a book, but I shouldn't be surprised, some of the best movies were first books.<br /><br />Let the Right One In is a creepy, quiet, and eerie movie and I thought it was pure genius. Though it moved at a slow pace my eyes were pretty much glued to the screen. There was a lot going on, bullying, blood sucking, murder, and loneliness and eventually friendship and love. It just worked.<br /><br />I think the one thing that bothered me was a lack of a backstory of Eli and also another character from the beginning of the film. It's only hinted at but not much more. I believe that it's expanded greatly in the book according to a bit of research I did.<br /><br />This movie brings you through a roller coaster of emotions, fear and sadness but also love. I really liked it and am disappointed to hear that Hollywood is already working on their own version as we speak. So much for letting this movie bask in the limelight. I would highly suggest this movie, and for people that scare easy like me, I would call it more creepy than scary. And for people that hate subtitles, it's there is also a dubbed over English track.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's hard to decide on how to describe this book.  I can't  think of a way to let you know how imperative it is for you to read this book.  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I thought the style of this book was wonderfully refreshing. The author doesn't spend his time trying to build rising action or hanging around waiting for the climax. I've never read a book that didn't  follow the normal system of building suspense up to the climax, and I actually loved it. I didn't feel the need to skip pages to the action: I savored every page. I even found myself rereading pages over again to make sure I got everything out of it. Even though this book is, as the description says, a simple story, the hidden depth is really staggering. Even though it sounds cliche, this book really did make me laugh out loud and sob unashamedly. I think that every book lover should pick this book up right away: I see no way in which you could be disappointed. Honestly, probably the best piece of advice anyone will give you anytime soon? Read this book, and soon.

B001O4XWJM|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I am a fan of both Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen, so naturally, I had moderately high expectations. While the acting is decent, the story makes no sense and seemingly contradicts itself several times throughout.    I understand that this is supposed to be a \\"spaghetti western\\". Even so, the weak plot lines associated with those series of westerns fail to justify the complete lack of a cohesive story in this movie. This may be the fault of the novel this film was adapted from, and if so, why couldn't they modify the screenplay like they do all the time? A majority of the blame I would direct towards Ed Harris, who both starred in and directed. Even the characters contradicted the persona's the film painstakingly develops. There was a general lack of suspense and even the action scenes were not exciting.    In short, a long and boring movie, with a weak plot, that seems to drag on and on.   Ed Harris: I love you buddy, but please, stick to acting.
0142403873|5.0|An acquaintance with young children lent me this book, when he knew I was interested in writing children's stories myself. He said his children loved the book and, once I'd read it, I could see why. It's a beautifully illustrated tale, demonstrating how brain can overcome brawn, as a small mouse escapes the clutches of various, dangerous woodland animals by threatening them with a huge, hideous and apparently imaginary creature called the Gruffalo, only to then be met by the huge, hideous creature himself (perhaps another moral here i.e. be careful what you wish for, you may get it). So he is then required to exercise his ingenuity once more to escape becoming a tasty Gruffalo dinner. The rhyming verse appealed to the poet in me and, in my opinion, makes the story an ideal one to be read out loud to young children and aquaint them with new vocabulary. I wish I had come across this book sooner, when my niece and nephew were younger, because they would have loved it!
B00004XONN|5.0|It may take several listens to enjoy this magnificent album. At first, i honestly really didn't like this album...thought it was elevator music.  however, i had to listen to it several times to enjoy it.  Without any doubt, this is among the top 10 albums of this decade.
0142501123|5.0|I was lent this book by an acquaintance and, having already read the Gruffalo and enjoyed that, I was looking forward to reading this one as well. I was not disappointed. In fact, the story appealed to me even more, if that's possible, than the Gruffalo. I liked the idea of a friendly witch who meets new friends on her journey to recover her hat, bow and wand and how, by working together, these friends overcome a greedy, red dragon. Personally, I think there is far too much emphasis in today's society on competition and having to be 'better' than others in order to be 'successful', and so any story that teaches children the value of cooperation is welcome. The story, whilst simple, has suspense and is wonderfully imaginative: the so-called 'monster', for example, is just a marvellous creation and brilliantly illustrated. And what child - or adult for that matter - can resist a bit of magic? It all results in a superb ending that had me smiling from ear to ear. As with the Gruffalo, the rhyming, repetitive verse makes the story very 'child friendly' and the wonderful rhythm captivates you from the word go and 'whooshes' you through the story (being a poet, myself, that is something I really do appreciate). As a child I would have loved to read this book and as an adult I loved reading it, because I've never grown out of that love of fantasy that makes a child's eyes shine (it's what inspires me today to write my own children's stories). I think this story is one that will tickle every child's fantasy. Highly recommended.

0374139563|2.0|This book - written by a Zambian woman with a background from Goldman Sachs and as a consultant for the World Bank - is a peculiar mix of cynicism and naivité. As the title suggests it is a frontal attack on the aid industry which she with broad strokes claims is destructive for Africa. But she also professes to provide a recipe as to how Africa can get out of the quagmire.  Following a brief history of aid, Moyo goes through a catalogue of criticisms levelled against aid. Her overriding assertion is that it is hard to see that any economic growth is linked to aid directly. If anything, she says, the evidence over the past 50 years suggests the opposite. She turns the words of Rwanda's President Kagame into her own: while more than 300 billion dollars has been spent on the African continent since 1970, it has little to show for itself in terms of growth or human development. It is a bit peculiar, by the way, that she chooses Kagame to bear such witness since Rwanda elsewhere in her book is classified as a fully autocratic regime. But she does not seem to care much for democracy as a positive factor in development, anyway. On the relationship between democracy and development she maintains that any improvement in Africa's economic profile is largely achieved in spite of (nominal) democracy, not because of it. The footnote to that statement, however, is far more nuanced.  Moyo has many good points of aid criticism to bring to the table, even though most of them are not new. The problem is that she carries them to the extreme. It is astounding that an academic, presumably well versed in methodology, can attribute so much of Africa's misery to aid. Her careless treatment of the attribution problem is coupled with a polemical and at times tabloid style of writing. That's a pity because it undermines her credibility as a serious contributor to an important debate.  While Moyo's depiction of the ravages of aid is cynical, her suggested solutions are naive. As a model sheuses a fictitious African state - the Republic of Dongo - with traits typical of many contemporary African states, and endeavours to show how Dongo can get onto a development path without aid.  With a background in the financial world Moyo tend to over-emphasise development financing as the key factor to the detriment of other ingredients. At the macro level she has great belief in the bond market. It is therefore imperative for Dongo to acquire a credit rating better than triple C to induce confidence by foreign investors. However, this is not easily done by snapping one's fingers. Has Moyo forgotten that the majority of African states are so-called HIPCs (heavily indebted poor countries) that have failed to service their debts since the 1980s and therefore in need of special debt relief facilities by the IMF and the World Bank?  Moyo sees China as Africa's friend, albeit not without qualifications. But she probably underestimates China's self-interest (access to oil and minerals) and the composition of trade exchanges (oil and minerals for mass consumer goods). This structure smacks of classical imperialism.  At the micro level Moyo is a champion of micro credits and sees remittances from the African Diaspora as a key factor. Good points. However, she considers political conditions as critical. Good governance trumps all, she says, with justification. It is strange, therefore, that she claims her recipe is easy to follow. What is needed and what is lacking is political will. But Moyo says nothing about how that political will can be brought about by corrupt regimes.   There have been many recent books bemoaning the misery of aid and its ineffectiveness. This is not among those I would recommend people interested in aid issues to spend their time reading, even if it is an easy read. Unfortunately, Moyo's book is to too much based on anecdotes and easy generalisation to be a significant contribution to the debate.
B001R10BM8|2.0|At the time of this film's release, the critics went absolutely bananas about Connery's return as Bond.  One critic, in a moment of pure insanity, declared it the best Bond film since \\"From Russia, With Love.\\"  The critics sneered at the Moore Bond film released earlier that summer \\"Octopussy.\\"  When it was released on videotape several months later, the critics continued to fall all over themselves in praise.  The film has since been reevaluated and now, 26 years later, it is now recognized for what it really was: a mediocre and totally unnecessary remake of the far superior \\"Thunderball.\\"  There have been numerous books detailing its making and we now find that Warner Bros. was ready to pull the plug on this tired mess of a film and it took Connery stepping in and taking control that ennabled the film to be finished and released.  Look lets face it: Connery was the best and still is the best James Bond.  The film does also have a nice supporting cast: Klaus Maria Brandauer is an enjoyably insane Largo, Barbara Carrera is also outlandishly nuts, Kim Basinger looks good as Domino, Edward Fox is a pompous M and Max Von Sydow is given little to do as Blofeld.  The problem is that the film is totally unnecessary, there are no scenes that improve on \\"Thunderball.\\"  \\"Thunderball\\" had the greatest underwater fight scene between the US Marines and Blofeld's stooges at the film's conclusion, it still has not been improved upon in any underwater film.  This film does not even attempt to improve upon it: the underwater confrontation between Bond and Largo is a confused mess wherein one cannot even tell who is who.  This is indicative of all the action in the film and the entire film itself.  This film is a mess, made solely to have Connery's name in a Bond film again.  The much maligned (at the time) Moore Bond film \\"Octopussy\\" was far more exciting and enjoyable.  Justice was served when the Moore Bond film made more money than Never Say Never Again. Moore even mentions thesatisfaction that gave him in his recently published autobiograpy.  As stated previously, Never Say Never Again is now finally being recognized for the mediocrity that it always was, see the original Bond classic \\"Thunderball\\" instead.

B000093FLA|3.0|Guy Ritchie's 2001 film SNATCH intertwines two separate plots among the London criminal underworld. In the first Turkish (Jason Statham) is an unlicensed boxing promoter, trying to ensure his fights for the gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) stayed fixed, in spite of the capricious nature of his boxer Mickey (Brad Pitt). In the second, a diamond stolen by the thief Franky Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro) is sought by the former Uzbek KGB agent Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija), the American jeweler Avi (Dennis Farina), and local pawn shop owner Solomon (Lennie James). The strands are pulled together by plenty of shootouts and some savage animals being set upon some poor victim.<br /><br />In its varied cast of characters, all up to no good, and in its intertwining of separate plots SNATCH is like Ritchie's earlier film LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS writ large. Nonetheless, its action is sufficiently different that it doesn't feel like a repeat. Brad Pitt turns in an admirable performance as an Irish Traveler, with a convincing command of this group's peculiar English accent and sense of humor. I found the film's soundtrack often grating, however, and the lack of any female presence was glaring. All in all, it's an entertaining film, if not especially deep.
B000ZN8036|5.0|In my mind, it is quite rare that a film adapatation of a great book can live up to its predecessor.  Sean Penn's adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book of the same name is one of those films that is on par with the book.  While I prefer Krakauer's book by a small margin, this was a great film to watch.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch stars as Chris McCandless, bright Emory University graduate, who gives virtually all his possessions, donates his savings to Oxfam and \\"drop outs\\" of society to make his way to Alaska for a journey of self-discovery.  Penn's film is filled with superb performances by everyone from Vince Vaughn and Katherine Keener to William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden.  However, it is Hirsch in his portrayal of Chris and Hal Holbrooke in a remarkably deep and tender supporting role that really deliver stand out performances.<br /><br />Both the cinematography and the soundtrack are unbelievable -- providing a stark and open feeling that complement each other.  As Chris makes his way from the bustling urban city of Alaska to the remote environs of Alasaka, Penn creates the feel of a both a \\"road\\" and \\"wilderness\\" story without feeling like this is something we've seen before -- it had a unique and original gestalt to it.<br /><br />There are two critiques that I have of the movie:  (1) Penn's movie makes a stronger statement about the role of McCandless' upbringing that led to his complete abandonment from his family.  It certainly was not so explicitly addressed in Krakauer's book and the tension of this relationship provides for a more dramatic movie.  (2) When McCandless is in cinder-block city, I felt the whole \\"romantic\\" interlude with the young teen singer was gratuitous and detracted from the story for me.  I didn't feel we needed that encounter to further dramatize Chris' virtue and \\"self-control\\".<br /><br />While I loved botht the book and this movie, they both leave me with an unsettled feeling.  While many dismiss McCandless as naive and foolish, I felt both works led to a more troubled, nuanced sense of this young man.  Certainly there was a naivete to him, but he also was a lost soul, struggling to find his way in the world -- seeminly unmoved by the increasingly material world -- and without a real kindred spirit as he searched for his identity and meaning.  I was left with a sense of bewilderment that someone would make such a sudden and complete break from those who loved and cared about him -- and the fear and despair that this created with his loved ones.  Whether Chris found himself and was truly at peace in the wild, we'll never know.  His story, while tragic, certainly led to two amazing works of art.both works led to a more troubled, nuanced sense of this young man.

Ask a bushman he'll tell you all about the flies. It must have been Nicole's perfume ?? Jackman-Brown-Wenham & Thompson (Especially Magic) and the rest of the Dinkie Die actors made this film very watchable. There are parts of the Australian outback culture that were far to fairy taleish for me to believe ! The final harmonica scene on the front of the boat was a bit Titanic like too. I was pondering at times how a frail pomme aristocratic sheila could manage to run a rugged outback cattle station for 6 months without her beloved Drover ?? (Too much) There was also the scene where the church kidnapped the little boy and the soppy scene of him waving on the back of the boat like he was going on a cruise !! with Kidman sobbing on the Wharfe why didn't he jump !! beyond me a little. All in all Nilcole your still a star.The cattle heard were amazing too ! after the long Drove they still looked fat and healthy ! remarkable eh ! Not one Bluey (Aussie working dog) a cattleman's best friend to be seen anywhere ?? Also Kangaroo's running like a flying fleet FJ's and the lack of Dingo's around the herd mmm ! questionable. I did enjoy the bar punch up though !! That was Aussie ! Our young footy player's in season all over Australia still perform this ritual contest (nothing like an Aussie Bloo)I just hope people around the world don't come to Aussie and go wandering around the scrub relating to this movie They'll perish real quick for sure.

I really enjoy reading Holmes and Watson's adventures, solving the mystery, and putting the puzzles together.
1400034205|4.0|W. Somerset Maugham's classic work of fiction, THE RAZOR'S EDGE, depicts another aspect of the Lost Generation and American expatriates who traveled to Europe.  Paris is the setting and centers on the high-class society of the Jazz Age as they carouse in their almost aristocratic nature.  There is an inkling of semi-autobiographical references intertwined within the narrative that is loosely associated with the author's own life.  The six major characters in the book that Maugham examines with great detail and blunt sarcasm construct the bulk of the story.  First, there is Larry, a World War I veteran who typifies the \\"lost\\" in the Lost Generation and highly educated, who could have easily been in an F. Scott Fitzgerald or Ernest Hemingway story, Second, Elliott Templeton, the seasoned and kind uncle who hobnobbed with society, third, Gray Maturin, the average man who cannot be without his work, fourth, Isabel, the life of the party and Larry's former girlfriend who is married to Gary, Sophie, almost a female version of Larry, and Suzanne Rovier, mature and friendly woman who eventually becomes Larry's wife.  With most novels that use the generation that happened to survive the Great War and quickly adjust to adult life, though fragmented, this novel cuts deeper and crosses cultures philosophically and spiritually.<br /><br />Larry represents the hundreds of young men and women who attempted to find their way in the world during the 1920s and 1930s seeking some form of solace in a life where he had experienced chaos.  And within the center of his journey, identity is at the core.  His character and his part of the storyline are the heart and soul of the book, which is beautifully written within the last 71 pages; it is a display of enlightenment that has woven Western intellectualism, but in particular in the English vernacular, Eastern philosophy, Hinduism and the hierarchy of Vishnu, Brahma, and Siva, that attempts to interconnect and bring greater meaning.  However, Larry grasps for understanding when he is asked if he believes in all these elements, `I don't think it's possible for us Occidentals to believe in it as implicitly as these Orientals do. It's in their blood and bones.  With us it can only be an opinion.  I neither believe in it or disbelieve in it' (266).<br /><br />THE RAZOR'S EDGE is a thought-provoking book that may leave questions to be asked.  Possibly that may have been Maugham's purpose, but he has left it to the reader to determine that aspect of the story, especially with the opening lines of the book.  But while reading the passages, one cannot resist to think that if this book had been given a third opportunity to be made into a film, Merchant-Ivory comes to mind because the storyline and the characters possess the traits that many of their films depict.  But setting that thought aside, Maugham writes an intensely contemplative story that shows the kinks of life not seen through the lens of rose-colored glasses.y grasps for understanding when he is asked if he believes in all these elements, `I don't think it's possible for us Occidentals to believe in it as implicitly as these Orientals do.

B001ECQ6PG|4.0|I bought this for when i go to college this fall. Its sits nicely on a desk or small table with out any movement. I've taken it with me to a few houses and transportation is easy, the only problem is there is no pocket for the power cord so that has to be carried by itself. The sound is not amazing, but its better then what you expect from something its size.     As for ripping to the computer the program that it comes with is not good at all, especially if you dont use iTunes. I just downloaded audacity which gives a lot more control over the sound. it does take a bit of effort but ripping to the computer was easy, with sound quality staying very good.     My main gripe is that when you plug in headphones the music stays very audible though the tiny speaker. So if i was trying to sleep with a room mate they would still be able to hear everything pretty clearly.
0790729407|4.0|I didn't know if the film was distorting history but someone who knows the story of Michael Collins assured me this was a pretty accurate portrayal of him in here, which makes this film go even higher in my ratings, because it's definitely entertaining and is spectacularly photographed.     There is more blue color in here - beautiful blue - than in any movie I've ever seen. It looks just gorgeous on DVD. I would be anxious to see what a sharp Blu-Ray transfer would look like.    Liam Neeson's charismatic portrayal of Collins keeps you riveted to the screen, even though it's a fairly long movie. Julia Roberts and Alan Rickman seemed a bit miscast. Being American and British, respectively, they weren't quite believable as Irishmen, perhaps because I'm used to hearing them as they normally talk. I also don't like to hear the Lord's name in vain so often as what was in here, but the Irish......well.    Whatever, this is a very interesting story with a nice combination of drama, action and romance. Very much recommended regardless of anyone's stance on Irish-English relations
B001B223TW|5.0|This is a wonderful production.  The clarity of image seen with blu ray enhances the experience.  The light levels are nearly at the level one would expect at the opera house (watch it with the room lights dim for full effect).  The  sound is only that found on standard DVDs, not the master audios one can do with blu ray -- however the sound is good, with excellent imaging.  I do not have the background to comment on the vocal quality, except that I found it enjoyable; the audience did also.  The extra's are of high quality, interviews with the cast, a piece on set and costume design and a very nice piece on dueling and fight preparation,  the menu is arranged in an orderly way and it is easy to find one's way through the disk menus.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too.    Kids will love it, I am sure. The \\"monsters\\" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy.    There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too, and I'm anxious to check it out when it comes out on Blu-Ray in several months.
B000007U6V|5.0|Autobahn is hard to find and usually pretty expensive. This was the best price by far if anywhere I had shopped. It arrived in plenty of time (as it was a gift) and in perfect condition. I would certaily use this vendor again.
B000J103WA|1.0|WARNING - this HD-DVD version will not paly on regular DVD players ... not even.
142312166X|5.0|It's got suspense, excitement, and adventure (with a twist of romance and comedy).I'm a major fan of Rick Riordan and absolutely LOVE this book. It also has fun activity pages, interviews with Camp Half-Blood campers, and much, much, more! You have to read this book if you are a to die for fan.
0743517849|5.0|I discovered Thomas Stanley about 6 months and his material has had a major impact on my thinking.    The big message that I am taking from this CD is that frugality and financial independence are closely linked. Many high income earners have a big house, flash cars and an expensive lifestyle and are not really saving for their long term financial future. Other low to middle income earners who have personal budgets and are frugal can be more financially independent than high income earners.    I have started tracking my spend and cut down on my outgoings. I am going to put together a budget for my persoanl and business outgoings, reduce my total spend and put the balance into savings, every month. I will start at saving 10% of my income and increase that to 15% and 20% over the next 2 years.

B0011HF6GE|4.0|It seems that everywhere I've gone worth going to lately, this album has been playing. Musically it is both the soft blanket of snow on a desolate landscape, and the flannel blanket wrapped around you by the fire in the cabin. That's the only way to describe what it's like to listen to this album. Some listeners may be turned off by Justin Vernon's high-pitched, folksy, strangely not-quite-falsetto, but I can't imagine anyone truly not being able to enjoy this album as a companion to a cup of hot chocolate and a book.
B000UJCALI|5.0|While many aspects of the Stephen King novel were changed, Kubrick captures the terror and fear of madness mixed with resident evil. This movie is worth seeing just for the incredible photography and haunting music (with its basis a Gregorian chant for the dead), to say nothing of Jack Nicholson's over-the-top acting and a superb supporting cast. Love him or hate him, Stanley Kubrick's brilliance is in no doubt here.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|When I first listened to Fleet Foxes I couldn't get past the fact that their sound was remarkably similar to bands like My Morning Jacket and Band of Horses. At the time, they sounded too similar to my ears. But I bought the album and continued to listen to it. Now, among every album I have ever listened to, it is easily in my top 20. And that is a very bold statement. This music will get in your heart and under your skin. Every song is beautiful, haunting, and expertly crafted. There is not a weak moment on the album. For any lover of music, this is a must-have.
B000002GBJ|5.0|This album helped establish Rick's unique place in the music world.  He used an amazing range of keyboard instruments on this, electronic and non-electronic.  He does a great job of creating a musical painting of the era.  If you like this, you might also try Steeleye Span.
B00005JMJG|1.0|When I first saw \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" I thought I must be the only person alive who absolutely despised it from start to finish. It's a cheap date movie that everyone has blown up into some kind of piece of art simply because it is post modern. Here are the reasons I dislike it:<br />1. It's a sci-fi date movie for people who are sympathetic with post modernism, nothing more. In that sense it doesn't go much beyond \\"50 First Dates\\" in terms of artistic credibility.<br />2. The characters are utterly selfish and shallow. A memory wiping device could have been used in a poignant way for people who have suffered genuine trauma and a real point could possibly (though I doubt it) have been made. Rather we get this, \\"here's a part of my past that is slightly inconvenient. I know, I'll erase my memory because I don't want to have learned from this experience.\\" That whole crap about I've been in love and therefore think I have suffered is utter nonsense. Try being raped some time.<br />3. This isn't so much for the film as for its rabid fans. In what way is this film \\"independent?\\" The trailers aired on NATIONAL television, the film itself is a household name, and every actor/actress in it is a household name. \\"Independent film\\" means independent of vast studio resources. This film isn't.<br />4. In general I think Kaufman is going way too far with post modernism. The search for meaning is greatly simplified if we believe it to exist--and it does!! Just not in any of his horrible films.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I must say it, this is by far the best show i ever enjoyed.<br />I really recommend it if your are the kind of Geek or semi geek guy or gal.<br />Can't wait the second season to buy it.
B001ILFUDM|4.0|WTF mate!  Pinocchio  is one of the best Disney accomplishments so i would presume the Blu ray would bring it justice...however we civilians are denied the right to view this masterpiece in it's 1080p full-screen or wide-screen glory  we are forced to view Pinocchio with black side bars because some genius wants everyone to view the movie the \\"Right\\" way  (a 1.33:1 ratio) rather than the natural 16x9 ratio of our TV)...apparently no one told the Disney staff there was plenty of room on the disk to have the full-screen, wide-screen, and this blu ray studio first \\"Disney view\\" I recommend the movie based on its value as a masterpiece but this new found idea called \\"Disney View\\" is quite upsetting and will probably ruin the lovely Snow white! soon to be released btw
B000004166|5.0|These violin concertos by Mozart are a pleasure to listen to. I have played them over twenty times, and like the finest wine, they get better with age!!! Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates great music.
B00127RAJY|5.0|just finished it for the first time and i have to say that i love it.  i never thought i could get an awesome sweat in 20 minutes.  i don't even have hand weights yet, and it still rocked.  i feel better than if i had put in an hour in the gym. i really like the fact that jullian takes the time to explain the proper form for the excersizes as well.  the only negative is that the jumping jacks are a little difficult for me as a larger chested person.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|So far this is her best work and I see Katy Perry going very far. Lots of hooks and music that makes you want to rock and dance! Just buy it!
B000002HPT|3.0|Hey It's pretty much my least favorite DT album but I still enjoy almost everything on it. Give it a chance...But I Highly suggest this one to the HC DT Fans Only.
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|Let me get this right out there, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a well made film with great acting. It just doesn't have any solid point but following the old young man until he is a young old man. Like anyone's life shown in whole, there is no climax and only a few interesting revelations which show themselves too early before the film's end. In short, everything that is done in this film was done much better in Forrest Gump and with more humor. The CGI process of making people look old and young is a true revolution in technology. It is thanks to that and everyone's fine acting that this got 3 stars from me. Worth a rental but not a buy.
0765348276|5.0|I am a huge fan of military sf.  I love the huge scope and exotic technology.  I do not like when the scope and technology are the main points of the story.<br />Old Man's War succeeds where others fail because it is character-driven military sf.  The technology Scalzi introduces is necessary and its details are spread out over the entire novel, and he doesn't explain it in a way reminiscent of a text book.  Because it's first person, everything is explained from a normal guy's pov.<br />Many are comparing Scalzi to Heinlein, and there are similarities, but he is definately a solid new talent on the sf front, something sorely needed.
B00004TX5F|5.0|Cleverly embedded within Farinelli's story is the true legacy of the Templar Knights: a secret yogic practice for self-liberation. Haendel in the role of the Templar Grandmaster, signified by the rod with horse-head he carries. This is the most complex, multidimensional movie I've ever seen. I watched it 3 times in a row, discovering more and more subtleties each time. Symbology is flawless throughout. This is breath-taking, indeed!
B000LXH11C|4.0|...if you are truly interested in the real Alan Parsons Project (APP) experience, then skip the anthologies and buy their other complete concept albums.<br /><br />Before that, though, I need to say that this collection provides the listener with the majority of the most popular APP singles.  It is notable for that reason, and it is therefore worth a listen for the person who may be trying APP out for the first time.<br /><br />That said...<br /><br />...APP does the concept album better than just about anyone else.  They are able to take a concept or idea and expand it to fill an entire album.  So if you want to experience a deeper, richer listening experience listen to entire APP albums, not to just the popular tracks.<br /><br />Try these albums on for size (I recommend listening to them in this order...the original order they were released):<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OFP8O4 Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002VC5 I Robot]]<br />[[ASIN:B0012GMVLM Pyramid]]<br />[[ASIN:B0012GMWJS Eve]]<br />[[ASIN:B000IOM1Z0 The Turn of a Friendly Card]]<br />[[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]]<br />[[ASIN:B000026D2Z Ammonia Avenue]]<br />[[ASIN:B000JLQSWE Vulture Culture]]<br />[[ASIN:B000IOM1YQ Stereotomy]]<br />[[ASIN:B000026C1Q Gaudi]]<br /><br />So, I assigned this anthology 4 stars not because the experience is particularly lacking, but because you could have a more complete and enjoyable experience by listening to the original list of APP discs.<br /><br />From a 30+ year APP fan.  I hope this was helpful!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|The same day I received this disk we invited the neighbors over for dinner.  I had no idea what to expect as I'd never heard of David Foster previously.  Well, a few songs into the disk and I could tell this was going to be special.  By the time we got into the Michael Buble cuts the neighbors were dancing and my wife was cooing in my ear.  What a production.    As to the format, I have a wide screen and the video showed up very nicely in 16:9 mode in 1080p.  My only wish is for an HD audio track instead of just 5.1 encoding.
006085880X|3.0|I'm about half way through this book and will continue reading since the story is piquing my interest.  However, it's spoiled by having each and every character unlikeable, stupid, nasty or vapid.  Ms. Picoult is now on my list of authors I don't read in the future.
6305128952|5.0|Loved this movie and needed to have my own copy to watch whenever I want. Great movie for all horse lovers
B001MYIXAW|5.0|You don't have to be fond of vampire flicks to love this film, just fond of masterful movie-making.  If you can't see this in the theater, get the blu-ray - the cinematography, complimented with the perfect balance of haunting music, poetic dialogue and pitch-perfect performances, is too gorgeous for anything else.      The mood is set early:  dark, tense, beautiful and sad, gripping yet slowly and deliberately paced.  I was entranced within ten minutes and it never let go.  It's a story of two misfit children who stumble upon each other and instantly bond - drawn to each other out of loneliness and dark secrets.  Oskar is an angelic looking 12-year-old boy bullied at school and forgotten by his divorced parents. Eli, a frail, neglected looking girl who appears to be about the same age, moves into the apartment next door.  We soon learn that Eli is neither a girl nor 12 years old - she's a vampire who starts slaughtering the hapless neighbors when she needs a meal.  The outside world is threatening and  troublesome for both of them, and Oskar and Eli develop a tender and endearing friendship under the cover of long, Swedish winter nights and a blanket of snow and ice.  But Eli needs blood and she is chillingly pragmatic about getting it. She is also rather reckless; victims start piling up and terrified townsfolk begin closing in.    If the movie has any flaws, it's because perhaps too much footage was left on the cutting room floor.  There are a few puzzling loose-ends that should not have been left that way, and I am guessing they are explained in the book.  Other than that, it's about as perfect as films get. It's not a feel-good movie and it's not for everyone, but it's mood and vision are mesmerizing and transcendent.  That's the kind of movie I love.
0452287022|3.0|Up until the last 50 or so pages, I didn't see much in this book.  The suspense before the ending somewhat covered for the beginning and middle parts.  I wouldn't have finished it were it not recommended by a friend.<br /><br />The characters slowly reveal themselves, and fully show themselves at the end, but they are they are not fully believable.  For instance, Griet, who cannot read or write, has an incredible sensibility for art and the insight to create this first person narrative.  If Maria Thins is the head of this household, why does she not stand up for Griet?  The same question applies to Vermeer, if it is he who has the power.<br /><br />The plot is not fully believable either.  Posing for Vermeer took long hours, time, which seem to be unnoticed and not missed in the running of the household.  Greit's \\"bedroom\\" seems to be way out of bounds for the time and the situation.  Greit's relationship with Pieter is alternatingly prudish and erotic.<br /><br />One thing that stands out is how few choices young people had in 17th century Delft. They live where they work long hours and are paid less than a living wage.  Given the small town, and their roles in service, they rub shoulders with the powerful.  They must walk a narrow line as the wealthy flirt with them.<br /><br />I appreciate the difficult work of writing this novel.  There is a parallel novel on the Mona Lisa [[ASIN:0767923065 Leonardo's Swans: A Novel]] where the author has the benefit of characters that participate in well know historical events.
6305076995|5.0|I first saw this film at a Saturday midnight showing. Early 70's. The sound is not great per 21st century standards for sure. But I think it is as good as it was then. The film does indeed have a \\"scratchy\\" feel to it. But in my opinion it adds to it's character.     Steve Howe is the star of the show. Rick Wakeman is a close second. All of the members perform expertly at thier individual instruments or vocals.     This is a must have for any die hard Yes fan or for anyone who's just starting to \\"get into\\" this great band.
0061655546|5.0|This book reads like a fast paced novel, except that all the events actually happened. The story is about the largest takeover in history (i.e., until the late 90s), the KKR takeover of RJR Nabisco. You won't find the details of deal structures, securities valuation or tax arbitrage. So a budding M&A banker might be disappointed in the lack of technical details. However, the character studies are fascinating, Henry Kravis, Johnson, the various bankers and the board. In this, you find the much maligned private equity players are not the devil incarnate sometimes portrayed in the media (although their ego do reach cosmic and comical proportions), the management were as corrupt and unscrupulous as you think, and the board is probably too close to the management to be a real advocate for shareholders. Ultimately, the winner of the bidding may not be so smart, as deal fever and empire building instincts take over good business judgment.  Entertaining? Absolutely.  Informative? Depends on what you are looking for.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The moves really dont seem that difficult.  The workout is divided into 3 segments so mentally 3 does not seem that hard of a number to do.  This kept me going. It was like.. \\" only 2 more.\\"  \\" Only 1 more.\\"   Jillian knows what she is doing, because I actually broke a sweat and felt like jello the next day.  This is from only 20 min. of workout.  It hurts the first few times then gets better. This video will work you out.
031606792X|5.0|I watched the interview with Stephanie Meyers before this book arrived at my home. She gave out a wonderful clue to help set the stage. She said that this book was like Mid Summer's Night Dream. If you've read the play or watched the movie you know that it's a comedy that ends up with everyone living happily ever after. At 31, I read each book highly anticipating the next move. She had several clues leading up to Jacob's imprinting. For me, this was a very empowering book, especially for young women. Too often we read/watch stories where the young woman is helpless and the only remedy is ending up with the hero. NO real empowerment, just another sad story of a kept woman: kept the same way, now just protected by a strong man. Edward help Bella build her own confidence and in the end, she endures the change, difficult decisions, but ultimately choosing her own path and saving the day. For what it's worth, re-read this book with that understanding. We need the fairlytale, but we also need to know the fairlytale ending requires a lot of work. I think the moral here is that we work hard upfront to reap the benefits later. It's a tale of delaying gratification, which is why so many people didn't like it. Stephanie, if you ever read this, know that I loved all your clues, all your storylines, all the heartache and joy, all the hardwork, and all the difficult decisions required to choose one's own path. Finally, thank you for telling the story so that even Vampires can live happily ever after!
B001C08RHA|4.0|Incredible special effects but overly simplistic storyline.  Overall, a good movie for the entire family.
B001N26GFM|3.0|[[ASIN:B001N26GFM The Boy in the Striped Pajamas]]  Wonderful as a Once Upon a Time story, with no surprise climbing to the next scene. Basically a little lacking in the last 1/4 of the movie, and the strange fitting, so as to show only One, (1) Child in the Camp? Very Questionable!  I would say the movie was extinguished at the moment the clothes came off for the so called shower.   A trying but failing end.......F I N E.....
0930289234|5.0|Still on the fence about reading \\"Watchmen\\"?  Then let me just add this to the mix: it isn't boring.  You were thinking that, weren't you?  \\"Lauded, acclaimed, one of Time Magazine's 100 best modern novels, etc. etc., sooooo... must be boring,\\" I can hear you saying.  Because we all secretly think that kind of thing about any creative work that hints of being lofty, important, something beyond mere diversion, etc., don't we?  So, don't worry, I'm telling you: \\"Watchmen\\" is engaging, often exciting, genuinely thought provoking, and, well, just a really good read.<br /><br />It's cynical as all get out, though, don't get me wrong.  The heroes are either ineffectual (Nite Owl), deranged (The Comedian and Rorschach), above it all (Dr. Manhattan), or rife with neuroses (Silk Spectre, mom and daughter versions both).  And they all live in a world so depressing and dangerous that quite possibly the best thing for it would be for the \\"heroes\\" to fail and the villain to succeed.  And I'm talking about a villain with a plot similar to the ones in those older James Bond movies, where the world has to be destroyed in order to save it.<br /><br />Anyway, just read it.  Yes, there are a lot of panels per page and lots of dialogue and description, but honestly, the story pulls you right in.  Just read a chapter per day (it'll take you about forty-five minutes if you don't rush) and you'll enjoy twelve days of the comics medium at its best.<br /><br />Like I said, just my two cents added to the several hundred opinions already recorded here.  Oh, in case you're wondering, I also liked the recent movie version of \\"Watchmen\\" a lot, and I bet you will, too, if you have any kind of affinity for this type of material.  But let the movie introduce you to the graphic novel, not replace it.  Or better yet, read the graphic novel first.  But that's up to you.  Just read the thing at some point.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Clint Eastwood has milked his Dirty Harry persona for years. He gives us one more take on the type in his portrayal of Walt Kowalski, a grumpy, bigoted Korean War vet. Kowalski has just lost his beloved wife and is a bitter and embattled man. His middle-aged sons are trying to move him out of the old neighborhood. His grandchildren are disrespectful, sullen teens. Chinese and Mexican gangs roam the once beautiful boulevards. And to top it all off, a family of Hmong has moved in next door.<br /><br />\\"Grand Torino\\" could have become one of many clich&eacute;d Hollywood movies -- the old bigot who learns to appreciate the ways of the immigrant; the brave man who cleans out the town of varmints; the codger who finds meaning in mentoring wayward youth. The movie is all of these, but more. Eastwood seems anxious to play up to his past image as much as to play against it. He spits (a la Josie Wales) and tells tough guys to \\"Go ahead\\" (a la Dirty Harry). But the movie takes us in unexpected directions when a young priest (Christopher Carley) tries to break through the shell of this tough, grizzled fighter to mend the tender soul inside.<br /><br />Terrific performances by Ahney Her as the young teen who befriends Kowalski. Even peripheral roles are limed with deft lines. Kowalski's sons and their families have little screen time, but it is enough to sketch a lifetime of disappointments and misfired parenting. The movie includes loads of politically incorrect name calling (gooks, zipperheads, slopes), though it seems tolerable and even comical from a man of painful secrets like Kowlaski.<br /><br />All told, an engrossing tale that turns the Eastwood persona on its head while working it for all it's worth.

0887306713|4.0|Reading Built to Last will not guarantee that your company becomes a Fortune 500 company, nor will it ensure that you rise to the Executive Board of your company.  It will, however, provide you with key insights into the corporate world and why some companies MAY fail or succeed.  It is important to realize that Built to Last is a review of past behavior of companies, with an explanation of observed results of the study.  Therefore, I do not believe that it is the Business Bible that some proclaim it to be, but it is a very well written book with great insights into the operation of Corporations.    For example, at the end of every chapter, the authors provide a message for CEO's, Managers and Entrepreneurs.  This section will summarize the key points of each chapter in a practical manner. Also, there is more than sufficient data and examples to support the main points in the book, which gives the reader confidence in employing the methods in their jobs and companies.      I am unable to rate this book as 5 stars, because I truly believe that luck and other invisible forces play a role in the success or failure of all companies.  While the principles that Collins and Porras have outlined are insightful and may explain a large part of why companies succeed over long periods of time, it leaves much unexplained.  For example, many companies named in the book went on to fail and eventually went out of business.  While it may be convenient to attribute these companies' mishaps to a strategic failure in following the principles laid out in Built to Last, it is impossible to not correlate at least part of their failure to market forces and other conditions outside of anyone's control.      Regardless, Built to Last is a book that is a must own for all people interested in Business or any other organization that they wish to see succeed over extended periods of time.
B000NIVJHM|1.0|i ordered the \\"dirty dancing\\" dvd, the description online said it was the fullscreen version. when it arrived it was the widescreen version. i do not care for  movies in the widescreen. i have checked back since i got my order and it is still being advertised as the \\"fullscreen version. i love the movie and always have, that's why i ordered it in dvd. i really think it should be advertised as it really is so other people don't get the wrong product like i did
0307237702|5.0|I work with a vast majority of Republicans.  In fact, about 90% of my work group considers themselves to be Conservative.  Many of my peers ask why I am still a Democrat, although I make good money now, and I tend to be very suspicious of Government.  I suppose that part of the reason may be because I am still young, and I was raised by Democratic parents.  I can now point to Barack Obama and the principles that he lays forth in The Audacity of Hope as the primary reason why I remain a registered Democrat.    I have watched CNN and Fox News, or read the newspaper many times and wondered what talking heads like Keith Oberman and Sean Hannity are talking about.  I have often wondered if they even live in the real world.  I mean, in my life, issues are not as cut and dry as these personalities make them seem.  Mr. Obama gets at the heart of this in The Audacity of Hope.  In this book, we see that though Mr. Obama is a politician, he sees the world in a very practical manner.  That is, ideology doesn't always dictate how one should act.  For example, Mr. Obama clearly explains the dual-nature of the American people.  He describes the Christian mother who has had to pay for her daughter's abortion, or the Liberal citizen who has a problem with Gay marriage.  That is the reality that I live.  Those are the people that I interact with, not the predictable characters of Radio and TV.    The key reason why I remain a Democrat is because I agree with Mr. Obama's portrayal of both parties.  For example, I concur with his observation that \\"...what has characterized the ideological core of today's GOP is absolutism, not conservatism.  I see the Republican Party as the more ideological of the two parties.  There does not seem to be any flexibility or diversity of ideas within the Conservative base.  On the other hand, while not perfect, the Democratic Party is fueled by more practical thinkers like Mr. Obama.  For example, Obama describes the plight of women: \\"...two visions [ofwomen are always] at war with each other-the desire to be the woman her mother had been, solid, dependable, making a home and always there for her kids; and the desire to excel in her profession, to make her mark on the world...\\"  He goes on to suggest that Government can help implement ways in which women are better able to fulfill both roles.    Regardless of your political ideology and affiliation, The Audacity of Hope is a must read, if for no other reason than because Mr. Obama is our President for the next 4 years and we all need to be informed of his plans.  In addition, I rate The Audacity of Hope 5 stars because it is very well written and easy to read.

B00009RDG9|4.0|Good movie. Not a great movie.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a good mentor/teacher.  Beautiful scenery and location.  Fights scenes are graphic, definitly not a movie for children.  Jones and Benico do alot of their own stunts.
B000127LW2|4.0|Being a big fan of Star Trek,I had doubts about Voyager.After all the Next Generation was very good and could not be topped.I even refused to watch Voyager because I was trying to be loyal to the Next Generation series.After two seasons of Voyager I started to watch it, simply to get my Star Trek \\"fix\\".I found that a female captian was really good and the shows were captivateing.I changed my mind about Voyager, but am still a Next Generation fan.I have most of the Voyager Dvds ,but they seem to be a bit expensive still.
B000005HLV|5.0|This album is legendary for more reasons than the murders. The music itself helped define an entire new wave of metal and is still fresh and unsurpassed today. Not a bad track on this one, but all of the elements fit so well together that it's hard not to get drawn in and \\"quartered\\" in the process. Attila does a great job as usual on vocals which works for creating the eerie atmosphere; Euronymous does worthy guitar work, especially for a raw black metal album, and of course Hellhammer is considered one of the best metal drummers period. I haven't found anything about this that I don't like, in fact it's one of the albums that I gladly shove down other peoples throats when I introduce them to this stuff. I absolutely love actual black metal, and most things that are dark, misanthropic, angry, depressing, hate mongoring,etc. they have a genuine and beautfiful quality about them (think H.R. Geiger's art put to music) so this fits in well with me.Hails!!!!
1439102813|5.0|It is amazing what a true journey Genova creates for the reader. I was a caregiver for a Alzheimers patient of a family friend for two and a half years. This book truly shows what it is like for the patient and helps caregivers understand their patients. What a gift this book was! Amazing for anyone who knows someone with this disease and even for those who don't. I cried, I laughed and grew by reading this book!

0743298039|5.0|Diane Setterfield has produced a book that is exciting, mysterious, haunting, and sad.  I loved the well-drawn characters, her artful prose throughout and the mysteries she puts forth which intertwine all of the characters throughout the story. I absolutely was drawn into it from the very first. It is a long book, and now and then you might find something that seems odd, but the people are odd in so many ways. If you are reading it, it will take some time, and you have to pay attention or you will \\"miss\\" something. I did not \\"read\\" this book; I listened to it. The narration was positively captivating and spoken with English narrators. I did not want to miss a word. There were clues about some happenings in the story, but I missed them until a new discovery appeared and then remembered that the clue had been there for quite a while. The one flaw I did find, and that might have been caused by the narration, was that just when I thought the book was finished, there was more! That might be off-putting for some readers. However, I give it a 5+! It's original, keeps you on your toes,keeps you wanting more and is beautifully written!
0061537934|4.0|This book is written from the view point of a dog. It brought back fond memories of my own dog and his love of the television. The book was sad and happy, and it left the reader feeling that there was a better place to go to after death.
0345337581|5.0|Simply put, this is the classic book on memory improvement. Without Harry Lorayne, mnemonics would not have had gained any public notice in the last several decades - period.<br /><br />This book is THE standard in learning how to improve your memory very quickly and very easily. The link method can be learned in minutes and you will use it in everyday life. The phonetic alphabet and Peg takes more practice, but is well worth the effort.<br /><br />If you are a student at any level (I am currently a graduate student) you must buy and practice these techniques. These memory devices (mnemonics) will save you a great deal of time and most certainly improve your GPA if you use them.<br /><br />Harry Lorayne cannot be thanked enough for his contribution to modern mnemonics. I have been using his systems for years and recently developed mnemonics for Biblical Language paradigms such as Biblical Hebrew [...]<br /><br />His methods make memory work enjoyable and profitable for anyone. I cannot highly enough recommend this book (this small paperback edition may be difficult for some to read as the print is small - you may want to purchase the larger edition). Mr. Loryane's most recent book \\"Ageless Memory\\" is also excellent and comes in a sturdy hardcover edition. Either book is excellent.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|this is a great rendition of the soundtrack.  We love it and play it frequently.  We loved this movie.  Reasonably priced also.
1606800000|5.0|I really like this story very much. After this reading, I even tried to think how the author constructed his plot, how he could make his plot function so well.<br /><br />After thinking for a long time, I admit that I cannot make such a beautiful plot without flaws.
6305313687|5.0|American History X is one of the rare movies that I remember after so many years after watching it. It's brilliant, shocking, thought-provoking! Edward Norton really should have gotten an Oscar for his performance. In fact, I feel that the film should have probably gotten Best Picture in the Oscars!    Getting this dvd from amazon was totally worth it! It is now part of my dvd collection library.
