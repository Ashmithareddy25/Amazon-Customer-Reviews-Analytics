B0063IH60K|5.0|I play solitaire all day. best app by far. downloaded it. you will not regret it. I browse passed all other apps for this one.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book is highly overrated. It was an okay read. There are much better books out there than this one. I will read the second book in the series to see if it gets any better.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love all the Jillian Michaels videos. She really will kick your butt and give you a full body work out. She only expects you to do 20mins a day but if you are only going to work out 20mins and expect results you have to bust your ass. This video is awesome. I love Jillian.
B000000HHE|1.0|I have just opened my cd and listened to it on my computer and it is complete garbage! The static and quality is worse than if I would have recorded it from a crappy tape player from the speakers. EVERY song is like this. I have contacted the seller, -importcds, to see if I can return or do anything to get some sort of replacement. I would try to sell it to a friend or used cd store, but honestly this cd is worthless and no one would buy it. BUYER BEWARE.<br />I wish I could download the mp3s, but I cannot find them anywhere.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Didn't want to change the head unit in my 2003 911 due to the complication of the factory amp/elec system, but needed a way to play mp3's. The Soundfly seemed to be exactly what I needed and turned out to be a great choice for the money. Easy operation and works exactly as described.  Just plug into the lighter/socket, set radio to an unused FM station, set Soundfly to same frequency, plug in thumb drive, and the music's there.  Less than 30 seconds to complete the process.<br /><br />Having used for a couple weeks now, the performance has been flawless. It sends a strong, clean signal to the radio, has an easy to use menu and song selection interface, and numerous input options.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't remember the spot in a song that was playing at the time the car was turned off.  When the car is restarted the next time, so is song.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to mention the customer service.  I received a personalised email shortly after purchase to check if the unit had arrived and asking if I had any questions. Based on my response, I received another email that obviously came from an actual person, which leads me to believe that if I ever had a problem with the unit, someone would be there to help.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I had not heard about this book, just saw it on the Kindle best seller list and being only $2.99 I got it. I will read it over and over again! I really liked Abby and Travis's love/hate relationship. I am sure a lot of people can actually relate to this book, maybe not the basement fights and the poker nights in Vegas but the actual relationship between them. Awesome book that I will recommend!
0307591549|4.0|The Happiness Advantage is an accessible, fairly entertaining introduction to positive psychology. The advice is simple, largely actionable, and helpful in keeping focused on happiness---and understanding ways in which obsessive focus on productivity can, in actuality, be highly counter-productive.<br /><br />Well-cited and including fun and memorable anecdotes, the book keeps a fairly light-hearted tone while providing plenty of useful data. Achor's humor is hit-and-miss, and his writing abilities are moderate to good. Achor does wax a bit long-winded at points, though never beyond the point of slight annoyance.  Don't come in with bloated expectations, and you should enjoy and learn from this book.<br /><br />Now, let me address some of the \\"low star\\" reviews:<br /><br />1) \\"This book is author-centric.\\"<br /><br />Yes. Achor's use of anecdotes tend to emphasize his own expertise and that he's right. To psychoanalyze the psychologist here, I'd say Achor's background of being the small fish in the big pond---at Harvard, surrounded by more extensively educated, wealthy individuals, as well as in dealing with CEOs around the world---gave him a sense that he needed to prove himself. He talks himself up more than is tasteful, but it's a minor distraction at most.<br /><br />Beyond that, what we're talking about is many anecdotes from Achor's personal and professional life. I like when authors use themselves as examples. We write what we know, after all. Why shouldn't we be our own examples?<br /><br />2) \\"This book is a manifesto for maintaing the status quo.\\"<br /><br />Pffft. No it's not. I'm a socialist myself, but unless you assume \\"productivity\\" and \\"profit\\" are synonymous (they're not), this book is valuable. It's about being able to balance our psychological limitations and resources in a way that maximizes how much we can do. What we do with our resources after is up to us.<br /><br />Now, I will gladly note here that Achor's use of examples and language contain a definite upper-class, male bias. He is discussing the stories and struggles of \\"poor old white American CEOs.\\" On the one hand: boo freaking hoo. On the other: These are well-cited, documented, and effective studies/examples that validate Achor's points. I do wish he'd applied it to more than the business setting (I assume his choice to do so was based on selling the book, in which case the choice was wise for that outcome), and wish he hadn't used some of the implicitly sexist language he had. But, again, a minor distraction.<br /><br />3) The book is all about \\"cliche-level advice.\\"<br /><br />Are these ideas you've heard before? Yep. Achor's work here is not as a philosopher, but as a synthesizing writer who brings together existing ideas, scientific studies, and memorable anecdotes. He makes points that seem at least somewhat common sense, then validates and reinforces them, and turns them to an actionable form at the end (at least to some degree, a \\"here's _how_ you can apply it.\\"<br /><br />The advice can be seen as cliche, but we live in a world of contradictory cliches---a million things we've heard before but that strive to create very different worlds. I like the world the advice here tries to create.<br /><br />4) You could sum up the books core points in half a page.<br /><br />Yes, you certainly could. (Isn't that true of most books?) But it would not give the same benefit as the book. As with most books of this nature, many of the pages are filled with illustrative stories and studies. I find that useful rather than tiresome, although Achor could have certainly trimmed a bit around the edges.<br /><br />So, no, this isn't a \\"learn lots of new ideas\\" book. This is a \\"learn scientific reinforcement and some fun stories to validate ideas you've already heard.\\" It's a good set of reminders to keep a person's perspective tuned toward, and their priorities elevating, happiness.<br /><br />5) These principles don't cause happiness, they correlate with it.<br /><br />Ah, the old scientific conundrum. Achor certainly does _not_ take a lot of time showing the methodology or similar that would demonstrate how the positive outcomes causes happiness rather than being caused by it (and I wish he had!). He cites his sources well, though, and does clarify that they have been found to be causative rather than correlative.<br /><br />That said: Cause-Effect is a shallow view of human emotions, imho. We function as holistic creatures with many integrated emotional and mental systems. Having advice, outlook, etc., that adjusts one end of the circle will adjust the other. That it's difficult to discern exact causation does not negate the usefulness of this book; happiness and success are connected in a relational, reciprocal way, and using the approaches given by this book (as well as positive psychology in general) can certainly help.<br /><br />6) The reading is bad.<br /><br />I have both the audiobook and the physical book. Listen to the TED talk before getting the audiobook; you will like his reading if you liked the talk. I certainly enjoyed Achor's reading.
B00004YX39|5.0|I LOVE STEELY DAN AND GAUCHO IS MY FAVORITE ALBUM, I LISTEN TO IT, ALMOST, EVERYDAY AND BLAST IT WHEN IN MY CAR.  THE COPY I RECEIVED FROM AMAZON IS PERFECT!!!
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|Sadly I think it has long been popular for critics (and a band member) to call this a Roger Waters solo album and criticize it.  This is unfortunate because while David is absolutely a great singer and guitarist, and Rick and Nick are great guys and very talented as well, all members of Pink Floyd should really appreciate the fact that Roger Waters amazing writing talent was the key to the \\"engine\\" that enabled them to drive their \\"machine\\" into superstardom.  Roger Waters was especially on fire at this time and was the creative writing genuis behind the best Pink Floyd classics - Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and absolutely The Final Cut.  David Gilmours guitar is incredible as always.  I have purchased every David Gimour solo cd, but the songs never hold up for me at all.  Vocals, yes, guitar, oh yes.  It bums me out to say it but I only end liking one or two on each cd.  Not so with Roger Waters' solo stuff, but of course together their music is so much stronger than solo...  Back to The Final Cut.  I have listened and been deeply moved by this cd too many times to count.  There are only maybe 50 to 100 cd's I can listen to over and over and this is one of them.  Now if they would only try to crank up the machine and make one more cd...
B0000ADY9I|5.0|I am reading in the current Rolling Stone magazine, an article about Gregg Allman's memoir called \\"My Cross to Bear\\". The article mentions that Dwayne died in a motorcycle accident in 1971. It reminded me of the concert I attended at a small theater in the round in Columbia, MD when I was attending the U of Md. We had seats facing the front of the band about 10 rows from the front, at just above eye level with the band. The place was small and intimate. The sound system was clear and not painfully loud as was the custom at many concerts in the day. My bro' Stan was there with me and he vividly remembers them opening with Statesboro Blues. It was an unforgettable evening. The band played with intensity, passion and joy, high five'ing after some of the long songs ended. They were really on, and into it. I don't think I realized until reading the article today that it was Dwayne's last performance. I've had this album forever in its original vinyl form but am ordering the deluxe edition to remember again how wonderful these guys were.
0553801473|1.0|The first 3 books were really great, then it went down hill from there.  First off, lets get to the point!  People are still running around and all the main characters are dying!!!!  Why start a series if there is no ending??? As far as I can see there is NO logical ending to this now and I wont even both with any further books or the series.  My opinion...don't read any of them, you will just end up disappointed.<br />If there was a way for me to tell the author to stop smoking crack and fix this story I would.  I would have put zero stars but there was ONE good part to this book and that was Cersi's story line.
B00756GKBA|5.0|As much as I loved the Confessions album, this is my favorite since the 80's.  Disc one opens strong and ends strong.  The track I play more than any other is Love Spent, worth the price of the CD alone.  I must say I would have swapped Beautiful Killer and Superstar as I really think Beautiful Killer belongs on the main disc....it's one of the best songs in the entire collection.  The album has enough variety, even a couple of ballads this time around (both excellent, btw), to satisfy most musical tastes.  The guest appearances here complement the final product rather than distract (ahem, Kanye and Timbaland on the Hard Candy CD).  Looking forward to remixes and live versions of this welcome chapter in the Madonna discography!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app always wakes me up in the morning. It even has a mode where you can have it so that you have to do math problems before it shuts off. lololol
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|August Rush is a great combination of a good movie for the young and a great shot of optimism with a bit of faith or mysticism thrown in for adults.  A feel good movie.  It's worth watching more than once in case you miss all of the small details that are significant.
1469984202|5.0|Such an amazing book.  I was so glad to see that there was more installments in the silo series available after finishing this one.  It wraps up nicely, but I want MORE!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|as with almost every review so far the energy is a HUGH issue. had this game on my kindle and phone and ended up installing from both.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|works wonderful on a Fire. fun to put your thoughts down on [paper] and try to tell others what you are thinking<br /><br />highly recommend it!
B003NX76BM|4.0|I love just about everything Nora Roberts write! I think she is awesome so I knew I would like this book, and I did. It is just as good as anything else I've read from her. She has always been one of my favorite authors actually.<br /><br />I really like when Roberts writes a mystery romance, I love those and this was great! I'm not usually a fan of mysteries but if there is a bit romance in it, why not!?!<br /><br />I love Fiona, she has been through something so terrible but she is so strong and she fight for her life, for her happiness. I hope I would have that kind of strength if something this awful would happen to me.She is a happy and a very strong woman who knows what she wants. She she is also marked but her past and who wouldn't be in her situation?!<br /><br />Simon is so rough in his personality and I just love it. He is such an as at times. He says it like he sees it and he never says anything he doesn't mean. He is also kind of hurtful sometimes when he says stuff but that is just the way he is and somehow Roberts makes him lovable! How is that even possible?<br /><br />This is a really cute Love story with a mystery twist! A perfect blend between murder and romance!
1439156816|5.0|I've read this book three times - each time i get something new from it. Amazing writer, amazing knowledge, just amazing... I want more!
0140271791|4.0|Well it is Maria Keys after all so what can one expect except a ton of really dark humor and a tragic life story thrown in a mixer and then we have Rachel's Holiday! It is an really funny book and at the same time very tragic and it really is an amazing combination. I love this story. It is amazing to get to read how Rachel thinks as an drug addict. She is in so much denial that you get really frustrated with her and just want to shake her and at the same time you feel so sorry for her. Great book is all I can say!
B0067R0APK|5.0|I tried multiple weather apps and Accuweather's was the best. It doesn't crash, it syncs easily and it even integrates into the Fire's notifications screen nicely. I like it so much that I paid for the Platinum version.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This was the best dance movie I have ever saw. It had the story, the characters, character development, music, and direction. It had everything I wanted to see and more. The actors made me believe in and care for them. I love watching them learn how to dance together and grow to love each other. I definitely recommend this awesome dance movie!
B000FC1192|5.0|This book is a bit dark but it's entertaining and gripping. Anyone who has seen the movie will be familiar with the story. The book has a dark tone over it which ratchets up the suspense. You don't know what's going to happen and you worry it's going to be something terrible. Well, I won't ruin the story.<br /><br />I purchased this for my son and he loves it. I think it took him less than 4 days to read it only because he never put it down. My younger one is now reading it and he is enjoying it. This is definitely a classic book that kids will enjoy.
B0060D49VW|4.0|I saw this in the theaters at first and later watched it again on DVD. It was a pretty good movie, but I just felt like it was the same story as the first one. But now the story is main star switches from a male role to a female role. I feel like the dancing was better in the first one as it had more of a variety rather than focusing on b-boy and b-girl style. I do like the actress and I found her very attractive. She is perfect for this role and was casts right for the part. I do recommend this movie, but one should watch the first movie first as it does somewhat relates and continues on to this movie.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I finally broke down and bought a Kindle Fire instead of investing in another iPad. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the Fire doesn't have it's own calendar! I use Google for everything and I thought the Fire would integrate nicely with their services but that is not the case. Anyway, I needed a calendar and this little app fit the bill plus some. I have multiple calendars and it downloads them all and allows me to view and edit them flawlessly. The interface is nicely done and it works without any problems. I can't say enough about this app. If you use Google Calendar, or want to, get this app to use it on your Fire. You won't regret it.

0345803485|1.0|**I wanted desperately to like this book. I struggled against common sense to like this book. \\"It did not work\\" in a Johnny-Depp-Dark-Shadows-type-of-voice. I am also working to finish my English degree in Creative Writing and have seen better fiction from my workshop classes (or my cat).**<br /><br /> I thought this book was going to be fantastic, but I was sorely mistaken. I have NEVER experienced a more obnoxious main character such as Anastasia Steele. I would say she is one dimensional, but even THAT is pushing it. Can she be a quarter of a dimension? Is she a 21 year old girl, or 14? Is she British or American? It goes back and forth quite a bit, so it's a little hard to decifer.<br /><br />1. The author has distracting phrases repeated; ad nauseum, such as these gems: \\"Oh my... oh my!!!...Holy F, Holy Cow, Holy Moses, Holy Crap!, Holy Sh**, Holy Hell. Basically, just insert whatever word you want after \\"Holy\\", because it's on every page at least twice. It was ridiculous.<br />2. We readers totally caught on that Christian Grey has a, \\"long index finger.\\" She said it so much I was thinking it SURELY has to be the focus of some steamy scene later on since it was drilled into our heads, but not really. How many times can she repeat that?<br />3. Who internally thinks their friends names by first and last? If she thought, \\"Katherine Kavanagh\\" or \\"Katherine Kavanagh Inquistion\\" ONE more time...<br />4. Her personal thoughts range from incredibly sophisticated woman (possibly British!) to obnoxious fourteen year old girl; using a word such as \\"avuncular\\" followed by the word \\"jeez.\\" (Avuncular means able, in short)<br />5. If I were the editor, I would have made sure this \\"Inner Goddess\\" nonsense was no where to be found.<br />6. Gosh, how could Christian Grey POSSIBLY understand how birth control pills work. Jeez, how embarrassing! Oh my!!! (Really Ana? Really? He has this elaborate sex contract for you to sign and you think he's not fully aware of how birth control pills work? Didn't you notice the Red Room of Pain? I'm pretty sure you did.)<br />7. Ana is written to be SO ridiculously naive. A 21 year old woman who has supposedly never explored her body or had \\"The Big O\\"?? Please.<br />8. A female cat would have more intelligent inner thoughts than this one.<br />9. Are they British? American? Do they have dual citizenship we aren't sure of? I am a big fan of British novels, so I understood the lingo, but Ana is a 21 year old AMERICAN woman. (I know, woman is pushing it.) She goes to IHOP with Christian and orders TWINING'S ENGLISH BREAKFAST TEA. AT IHOP. No, no. You go there to clog your arteries and drink chocolate milk. I haven't ever seen an IHOP like the one in this book.<br />10. As a woman myself, it's just not possible to even want to have sex THAT MANY TIMES in a row. It was actually comical and ridiculous all at the same time. I think they did it 3 or 4 times in a 15-30 minute window. I'm sorry, but that's not realistic and annoyed me. Not only that, but it was a pretty quick event where he demands it and she is totally ready to go. Even the 3rd time. I don't think I need to elaborate my point on that nonsense.<br />11. I saved the best for last. The most awful sex scene I have ever seen/read/whatever. It actually made me NOT want sex in ANY capacity. Having your lover rip your tampon out, have sex (while your drunk mother is downstairs in the hotel bar), getting blood all over him and then bathing is NOT COOL. I think I would need an entire 3 pages as to why this is all kinds of wrong. I don't want to be touched during that time, much less this. If this were a Vampire type thing with biting the neck and there was blood, that would be hot. THIS is GROSS. Ugh. Nothing about that scene made me want to just jump in the sack with my husband.<br />12. She is drinking with her mother in the hotel bar who encourages her to go upstairs with Christian. (Which is where #11 comes into play..) That is disturbing in and of itself, nevermind that actual scene I just described. Even Ana thinks of her mother like this: \\"Is she forty-two or twelve?\\" Smartest thought in the book and then goes back to thinking she's the smartest woman alive. Now we see with this character where Ana gets her brains.
0345803485|5.0|Amazing books!! So glad I read them. Left me wanting more ha. I highly recommend these books...you won't be disappointed.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|it runs good and smooth in my opinion every one need this game so far it is the best game I have played.
0375507256|5.0|Fantastic read from end to end, but as a new fan of Mitchell's work, his style is a tough one to grasp and some of the language can be confusing, but just hang in there.  His entwining narrative style is best exemplified here, with extremely satisfying conclusions to each.  Unlike Ghostwritten, this novel essentially splits chapters into two parts, all except for Sloodha's Crossin' and Everythin' After.  I couldn't count the times I laughed, or actually starting rooting out loud for some characters.  David Mitchell has mastered the art of making you think, align puzzle pieces, and fill them in once you have the right knowledge, and this type of satisfaction is something that you really only get as a writer.  It's brilliant, and the most accomplished book I've ever read.  Do not miss out on this novel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|hours of enjoyment. app runs fine. easy download and fun card features. will consider downloading other apps from this creator
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|You will miss so much if you do not read book one before going to see The Hunger Games movie.  So many more details in the book that they could not include in the movie.  Great price too by purchasing the trilogy on Amazon.
B0012GMUI6|2.0|He ruined Floyd to do this???<br /><br />Great band! Great story & concept! Unfortunately the songs are dreary & not catchy! This is self-absorbed mysogyny, and lyrically top-heavy! Melody wise this is paper-thin! The Wall & Final Cut were both dreary, but both had solid songs with good hooks! Rog, it's called collaboration...look into it!<br /><br />PROS: Nice guitar solo on Sexual Revolution from Slowhand, and the brief duet on For the First Time Today Part 2 was a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />CONS: Clapton, Sandborn & the other A-Listers take a backseat to Waters' self-absorbed mysogynistic lyrics. The concept is an interesting one involving dreams, temptation & fidelity (kind of like Doctor Zhivago goes on a cross country trip across Europe). With a little less lyrics, some well written hooks from Clapton, and perhaps just a lttle more lead singing from others and this could have been a classic.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all three books. It is like reading porn at times well a lot of the time in the first book but after the first book it doesn't as much but still has some sex in it. I have read them twice. You should read it. I almost put it down because of all the sex but my friend refused to let me and I am glad I didn't. Read it!!!
B002MW50KO|1.0|I am a huge fan going way back, so I wont say directly that it sucks (but it definitely lacks gravitational pull). Bob's tar-lunged croak is now absolutely intollerable here on these Christmas standards! The zydeco arrangement on \\"Must Be Santa\\" is kinda fun, but his shredded voice just makes me imagine that I am listening to someone with a blocked tracheostomy tube.<br /><br />I feel this CD could be a powerful learning tool for middle school health classes. Students would listen and compare Nashville Skyline with this dreck and thus learn an impacting life lesson on the dangers of cigarettes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is worth downloading. it has a variety of great games at many different level easy to difficult .
B005OK721G|5.0|The movie was one of the best I have seen in a while! The story follows a girl seeking revenge for the murder of her parents. It is great to see a woman as the leading role as a mercenary.  It takes you not only on an action packed ride but also takes you through the emotional ups and downs of dealing with the past while trying to pave the way for the future.  Zoe played the role great and the cast was great as well.<br /><br />All in all it was an action packed movie, that focused on an actual story rather than rely on just action.  I would recommend this movie!
B003TTIXOO|2.0|I am writing this based on having read the description for episode 1. I haven't finished watching Season 5 yet, but was considering purchasing Season 6 which is why I ended up on this page. Learning about George's death has really spoiled the remainder of that season 5 for me. I live in an isolated location where I very happily don't see any trailers or other television that would have made me aware of the content of this episode. Couldn't they be more sensitive to viewers by having less \\"hit you on the head\\" descriptions???

140053271X|5.0|Nook is simply the best. Its very ergonomic and good looking. User Interface is very user friendly and I am open to put books into it from any source.<br />It also handles pdf in a excellent way (in case of images and diagrams format will be disturbed but except-able), you can change the font size as you so in epub. A highly recommended product.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome game just wished it had more things to shoot than just acorn. everything else is fine. perhaps just expecting it just like the Mario game that's why.
0030565812|4.0|Received this as a Christmas gift, set it aside for months and when I picked it up I hustled through it in less than a week. Riveting and moving, from his days as a law clerk right up through his infamous prison stint. One of the better autobiographies I've read in a really long time. A stunner.
B0063GORYU|5.0|So much fun.  You have to try it if you like a challenge. I love cards and this is so much fun.  Plus its free.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Seriously the worst controller I have ever used. It's too small, the joysticks are in the wrong place, and it just feels like the thing would shatter if I dropped it. If you are going to buy a ps3, trade in this controller for store credit and buy yourself a good 3rd party controller.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is so poorly written and honestly very boring.  There is nothing to it other than a bunch of sex scenes.  The characters have no depth, the writing was not descriptive (\\"he did this, she did that, I went there\\"), and overall it did not keep my attention.  Don't waste your money.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|this is one of the best shows ive ever seen set in the ancient world. why the hell did it get canceled?
B00005JLSE|4.0|CZ-J, RZ and RG are excellent, what a talented collection of performers.<br />Production values are top notch - art direction, staging, choreography, cinematography and most especially the editing.<br />Artistically summarizes life in Chicago at that time in history, uniquely using the prespective of the women.<br /><br />Excellent 'adult' entertainment.<br />RECOMMEND
B000006NPY|3.0|ADORE is a total turn point in the pumpkins career...after 3 good rock albuns, they produced a eletronic pop album...you can hear some guitars, but this could be a pop band disc...I like some songs like AVA ADORE and PERFECT, but this is not inspired like Gish or Siamese dream...
1416905014|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift, and it was a big hit.  I received it first before gift wrapping it, and the quality was very good.  The artwork and detail on the pop up pieces was beautiful.  I plan on purchasing some more....she has a birthday coming up!

B0076NKNLA|5.0|\\"My Week With Marilyn\\" celebrates the story of how Marilyn Monroe became a huge movie star, from the low point of being hated by everyone on set, to overcoming her fears and gaining the appearance of best actress of her time, this film shows how beautiful film truly is. Eddie Redmayne and most notably Michelle Williams, deliver stunning performances as Colin Clark and Marilyn Monroe. Everything about this film is perfect. From the script, to the acting, to the picture perfect cinematography, \\"My Week With Marilyn\\" is a masterpiece.
0307352145|5.0|I finished reading Susan Cain's new book last night, which might have happened sooner if I wasn't so far down on my library's waiting list. It is a quick read, written in a kind and conversational style, and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Her basic premise is that the United States is governed by an \\"Extrovert Ideal\\" which can make things difficult for introverts. She goes through just about every different aspect of life, from the boardroom to the schoolroom to the bedroom, and discusses how the different traits of extroverts and introverts change a life experience.<br /><br />If you already read a lot of nonfiction on introversion, motivation, and/or education, you will probably see a lot of familiar studies in this book. Cain seems to be a little soft on the science side, and I often wished she would delve a little deeper into the studies. Perhaps it's because I already read many of them in other works. The real gold in this book is the personal stories of people Cain has interacted with and how they experience introversion in an extroverted world.<br /><br />I also found her chapter on cultures quite fascinating. Most of the book is about the United States and our Extroverted Ideal - meaning that extroversion is the most sought after trait in the US. But in many other cultures, especially some Asian cultures, it is introversion that receives the higher honors.<br /><br />I recommend this book for a few different types of people. First, for introverts who wonder about whether or not it is possible to change your personality: she spends a chapter delving into the various theories on whether our personalities are fixed or depend on situation. I was very interested in the Free Trait theory she introduced. Basically, we can adopt as a persona any personality we wish for a time, especially to serve some higher purpose.<br /><br />For those interested in education, especially homeschooling, I enjoyed the chapter on extroversion in schools and how it can be hard on introverted kids. In a society where dominance and outspokenness are more valued than knowledge, the introverted kids are being bullied and ignored in many cases. Since socialization seems to be the hot topic of homeschooling lately, I found it somewhat fascinating. Into which culture should we socialize our kids? Is it the most important thing? There was excellent food for thought here.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|MOVIE REVIEW #30  (DVD): \\" The Iron Lady \\"<br /><br />Meryl Streep having been nominated for an Academy Award 17 times and winning 3, this movie being her third win for playing the Historic figure, Margaret Thatcher! Her performance is amazing. It's detailed and extremely subtle. Broadly gentle and very honest in what ends up being the end of her life. I understand why she was nominated and why she won! With the make-up, movements and emotion...she was Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />However, Director Phyllidia Lloyd may not have the chops this type of drama film. It was slow to start and has the style of seeing the legendary English leader going through her daily routine as an elderly, dementia stricken woman - by going back and forth with flashbacks brought on by her old pics, memorabilia, news clippings and even clothing. Director Lloyd did a much better job directing Mama Mia.  The fast paced, toe-tapping, gotta-sing-along, movie musical with the ABBA soundtrack!<br /><br />What makes this movie passable and worth waiting for is the performances; once you get to them! Thatcher's husband Denis, played humorously by the brilliant Jim Broadbent (Harry Potter, Moulin Rouge, Indiana Jones) makes their partnership - both in life and death extremely heartfelt.<br /><br />Other amazing performances included those by Anthony Head (Merlin, Buffy The vampire Slayer) who was the Parliament President and that of Richard E. Grant (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Corpse Bride) who played Parliament's lead man. The two against Meryl were engaging to say the least.<br /><br />Overall the screenplay, written by Abi Morgan (from British TV) like the film, is a little slow handed. The pieces of controversy over English issues with her people and the Falkland Islands became great dialogue scenes with anger, frustration and why Thatcher was coined `The Iron Lady' by the Russians. If anything the performances and inside view of history that Margaret Thatcher made, make this film worth watching. I can see why she won the Oscar and the other performances were nominated....but I can also see why the rest of the picture wasn't nominated as film overall. Meryl is definitely worth it as is the rest of the cast. There is a great ensemble of actors in this film.....just takes a little while to get to those scenes!I can see why she won the Oscar and the other performances were nominated....but I can also see why the rest of the picture wasn't nominated as film overall.

1592536913|1.0|I'm SO sick of these \\"steampunk\\" jokers not giving any credit to the true godfather of steampunk, Wild Wild West. That is where this lame neckbeard trend started, and yet these gothic bimbos don't even have the decency to acknowledge the origins. GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!<br /><br />Also why are steampunk girls so f'n ugly, just because they're in a corset doesn't mean it transforms their blobby fat bodies into hourglasses. And the men aren't much better, dressing up in a metallic vest and a monocle makes you look like a child diddler, not a gentlemen. Steampunk is a phase that will soon pass, Cyberpunk on the other hand is vastly cooler and obviously superior because it's more logical then randomly throwing gears and steam and other stupid crap onto modern technology.

0345803485|1.0|This is the second hyped book I've read in a month that turned out to be awful (the first being Room). I did not know this book was Twilight fanfiction until after I bought it. From the first chapter you could tell. She has stolen Stephenie Meyer's characters and renamed them, not changing a thing about them from appearance to personality. You can figure out easily who everyone's Twi Universe counterpart is with no effort. Not only is it fanfiction, it's bad fanfiction. It's an over the top farce. Also I don't know how in the time that this was on fanfiction.net or in the editing process no one told the author she mentioned that Ana bites her lip 9287 times! It was mentioned on every.  damn. page.  It got to the point where I got violently angry every time I saw it. Also Ana seems to be an undiagnosed schizophrenic as both her \\"inner goddess\\" (who is also mentioned about 5,000 times) and her subconscious are visible to her and perform feats like doing 5 cartwheels on the way to the bedroom. This book is absolute garbage. If you must read it, google the original fanfiction .pdf

1612130283|1.0|As an English w/ Writing emphasis major in college as well as an avid reader of various genres, I have read many books in my lifetime and this was possibly the very worst of all. Of course it would be unfair to compare this fluff to a classic but I have read some real stinkers in my life and still this easily takes the cake. Most of the other one-star reviewers already expressed all that I feel about this book so I will make my review brief. The characters of Anastasia and Christian are totally uninteresting as is their relationship which reminds me kind of a cross between American Psycho and 9 1/2 weeks, except both those movies are far more entertaining than this book. The sex scenes are not erotic at all. I felt nothing in my nether regions whilst reading them, nor did I ever wish I was Ana being sexually dominated by this ridiculous man. In fact, some of the descriptions left me wincing a bit at imagined pain which was usually somehow translated into pleasure for this supposedly innocent heroine, Ana.<br /><br /> You must really suspend your disbelief to get into this book and even then, the writing is just so mediocre as to make me conscious the entire time of what a waste of my time this book was. I never cared about the characters or even where their relationship went. Frankly, the characters could have both died and I would have been happy about that, that is how much I did NOT care about them, plus to have them die would have added some much-needed interest to this story. Endless sex scenes were extremely boring. I would imagine unless you are over a certain age, and even then, I would like to think that we have all had our own very exciting sexual experiences that would know could never even come close to being recaptured in words. I almost felt sorry for Ana that she was wasting her highly-sexed self on such a shallow relationship. We all know that sex without some deeper connection, beyond wanting to control or possess someone, is just sex, just the meshing together of body parts for the end goal of orgasm, something anyone can do and something we all know how to gain pleasure from, at least most of us anyway. The fact that these two characters were having sex and enjoying it was about as exciting as reading about them eating food all the time and enjoying that. Actually, the turning of eating into an erotic exercise would have also been far more entertaining and I have actually read a book in the past that did just that, and I have never forgotten that book. This one will be forgotten in short order.<br /><br />Their sex life did nothing to develop them as characters and imho, took away from that development in that it made them seem very one-dimensional and juvenile. I fail to see why this is called \\"mommy porn\\". Does this stuff actually excite or inspire women? I am hoping we are not dumbing ourselves down as women and allowing this myth to be propagated to try to take back some power in a world dominated by men and their ideas of what sexy is. I find neither hardcore porn nor this book sexy. I like to think that's because I intimately know sexy is so much more complex than could ever be captured on video or in words, which is why I think many of the great literary masters only alluded to sex. There is simply no way to express real passion in frank terms without coming across as cheesy, amateur or even lazy. If you want your readers to really feel the passion between two people, it's through what you don't say, and that takes skill and talent. Something James may or may not have, but definitely needs to hone in on if she does. I'm a writer myself and some of my earlier works really show my lack of practice so I am not throwing the towel in completely on this author, but this book just pales in comparison to so many other books out there by contemporary authors so I am truly surprised by the success it has achieved, and again begs the question, \\"are we women really THIS desperate?\\"
0345803485|5.0|These books are not for the faint of heart. They are adult themed books with a great deal of descriptive sexual activity. That being said...the book was well written and intriguing. I could not put it down and ordered the other two right away to be able to continue the story. I ordered this book because all of the \\"hype\\" surrounding it, curious as to what the big deal was. Turned out to be a good read. Characters, plot, storyline, setting, all captivating. It was a very enjoyable read and I look forward to continuing the series.

0385737955|4.0|There has to be a way out; every maze must have a solution.  They have been searching for two years, yet the boys are no closer to solving this maze than they were when they first entered it.  Thomas's arrival in the glade, at the centre of the maze, appears to follow routine, at least for the next twenty-four hours, after which every pattern is broken and things start going crazy.<br /><br />Thomas arrives in the maze with no idea of who he is and where he's been.  He feels totally lost and confused.  No one answers his questions, they brush them away with the excuse that he is the newbie, he just doesn't understand.  Of course he doesn't understand, none of the boys answer his inquiries.<br /><br />While reading this novel I felt as though I was trapped in the maze with the boys.  I found my heart starting to race while Minho and Thomas were running to escape the grievers. I still don't know what grievers really are, but they are horribly nasty creatures.  I felt anxious each time they approached a corner of the maze.  In fact, I felt like Thomas, so many questions and very few answers.<br /><br />The glade itself is a fairly straightforward place.  Rather simple in fact.  It has housing, farming, and a forest with a burial yard.  The maze and it's reason for existence is complicated.  Then there is a world beyond.  What is happening out there and how does it  result in the boys being locked in the maze.  This story gives me lots to ponder and look forward to.  There are two further novels in this series: The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure.  Coming in August 2012 is the prequel The Kill Order.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|Most of the beings who have super powers in the comics are very altruistic beings, intent on being of service to the world.  The biggest example of this is Superman.  What happens though if you give these powers to an adolescent male who is experiencing: physical abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father; a mother dying of cancer; a school life where he is not one of the cool kids.  Well, as he uses his powers more and more, he starts striking out with them whenever unfairness again rears its ugly head.<br /><br />His cousin is one of the cool kids plus a nice guy and tries to reason with him.  The cousin also got these powers.  But he can't pierce through all the bad stuff going on at home.<br /><br />I really loved the first half of this film.  This was the getting to know the characters via a hand held camera as they fooled around with their newly acquired powers.  They were a lot of fun in this phase.  The back half of the film began to resemble CARRIE though and I began to lose interest as predictable super power fights took place between the cousins. The back half will probably appeal to the younger audience.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0679746323|1.0|This is PURELY a fiction book which is very useful weapon for anti-China losers.  The author wrote a bunch of books like this one based on her personal hatred simply because of the gone away high rank communist family prestige. I feel sick every time when I see this book sitting in the history section of all the English book stores, what a pity!
B007UXTG8M|4.0|I don't think anyone could say they enjoyed this movie.  It is so bleak that I doubt that is possible.  However, I believe this is the first film to really show us sexual addiction and what a grim state it is to be a sexual addict.  Michael Fassbinder does a tour de force job in the lead role.  He performs graphic sex throughout the movie and, but for the moment of release, is in pretty much a state of despair throughout it. Probably no one has had so much sex with so many partners and achieved so little satisfaction from it.  The movie at no point presents a rehab moment to soften its punch either.  This shows you the disease, not the cure, if there even is one.<br /><br />Carey Mulligan plays his sister who is adrift too but more in the way of where she is in life and her lack of prospects.  She does realize that one should want a relationship and friends which our lead does not. Ironically, he leads the most sterile existence it is possible to lead.  He goes from his blue tinged gray office to his blue tinged gray apartment.  He does his work at work and at home he does his sex, watches cartoons, eats or sleeps.  He has absolutely no interest in anything else. He can barely carry on a conversation which does not veer into sex.  When he tries to have a real date with a woman who is not a prostitute, it is a catastrophe.  He only can carry on with prostitutes or the female equivalents of himself, mainly married women on the prowl.<br /><br />This is well written, well directed, superbly acted BUT is stark and grim.  So if you are looking for a nice way to relax after work over a movie, I doubt this will fit the bill. I would be very surprised if you even considered the graphic content as capable of taking you out of the grim state of the film.  I can see why critics loved this film though and also why it was up for awards.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004LUS390|1.0|App no longer works with Kindle Fire post-upgrade, per other comments below.  Otherwise, is a great app -- but a waste of money for kindle-fire users.  Bummer.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|This series of books perhaps would have been better off if only the first book's storyline was kept. The second book was an absolute nightmare to read. It adds in characters and odd plot twists that weaken the general streangth of the initial story. The third book, however, is an improvement to the second, but I agree with many people the end was not at all satisfying. I would suggest only in reading the first book and, to be honest, it is all the Hunger Games needed in my opinion.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Well, there are already hundreds of reviews praising this series for all that it entails...the quibbles between the books and the tv episodes are minor at best, and with at least two more seasons on the horizon, one can only wait and hope they do as well as this one.  The only issue I've had so far is with the discs themselves...they refuse to remember where the episode left off if, say, I had to turn off the PS3 and go do something else, if I come back to it, it starts all over again from the episode menu.  Anyone else have this issue for blu-ray?  It could be a PS3 issue I suppose, but one never knows...<br /><br />This is a story, first and foremost.  It is not a happy story, or a friendly story, or even a story told from just one character's point of view..it's told from many, and how their lives all intersect and weave together...the choices they make, for good or evil, the people that live or die as a result of those choices, and the maxim that \\"power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" hanging over everyone's head.  In one of the special features, George R.R. Martin said something to the effect of seeing the world in shades of grey; a \\"good\\" character can have flaws and perform an evil deed or two, and \\"evil\\" characters can have shining moments of redemption under certain circumstances. Thus, the characters in the series reflect this, and everyone will  be able to identify with at least one character here, regardless of his or her fate.  A good story should be able to make you laugh, cry, want more, identify with the characters and situations, and watch repeatedly and possibly learn something new each time...for me, this series does that in spades.<br /><br />It should be mentioned, however, that the MA rating is well-deserved, as this series doesn't shy away from violence and bloodshed, or wanton acts of cruelty, or..and this is probably the biggest thing..\\"sexposition\\".  Steamy nude scenes mixed with important plot points are scattered throughout the episodes, on top of \\"normal\\" sexual discussions, portrayal (and most of it is well into the hard-R rating territory) and natural nudity (male and female), homosexuality, incest, and the fact that some of it revolves around children coming of age (they're younger in the books, so I can only guess a few older actors and actresses were switched in to prevent some major issues).  I wouldn't let any kids I had watch it until they were much older, is what I'm saying..for those of us that can handle it, though, the above review stands.  Give it a couple of episodes and let it flow...by the end you'll definitely be hooked.out the episodes, on top of \\"normal\\" sexual discussions, portrayal (and most of it is well into the hard-R rating territory) and natural nudity (male and female), homosexuality, incest, and the fact that some of it revolves around children coming of age (they're younger in the books, so I can only guess a few older actors and actresses were switched in to prevent some major issues).

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fair warning, this review will contain spoilers for the previous two books.<br /><br />The revolution has begun and Katniss is the face of the rebellion. Peeta is in the clutches of the Empire, er, Capital. District 12 has been razed to the ground. Enemies in the arena are now unlikely allies. Hiding out in the subterranean District 13, Katniss has been asked to lead the rebels symbolically through a series of... television spots?<br /><br />Collins has made some interesting choices for this installment. Like the other two books, it's about half PR campaign and about half combat in some form of arena (there's no literal Games in this book, but the metaphor is painted in broad strokes). You can't help but wonder what she's thinking. So much of the plot is driven by a quest to get good propaganda footage while the boots-on-the-ground military action happens almost entirely off-screen. It works, and perhaps it works better than it would if Katniss had spent more time in combat, but it's still perplexing.<br /><br />Katniss sees plenty of action, but she seems to spend most of her time recovering, because the book isn't all that interested in how you win a revolution. Instead the big questions are \\"What kind of person do you have to be to overthrow tyranny?\\" and \\"What do you do after you win?\\". When ruthless people fight each other, everyone suffers, and everyone suffers here as well. And then, in the last fifty pages, the book goes completely off the rails. When it does wrap up, in ways it's a betrayal of the reader's ideas of revolution and justice. On the other hand, it is the natural finish of this story. It was almost like the conclusion of the last Matrix movie--it's not the resolution you were wanting, but how else could it have ended? (Before you go accusing me of spoilers, it's not THAT much like the end of the Matrix in terms of narrative, but the tone was similar.)<br /><br />In short, this book is a lot to process. I'm still rating it highly, because it's every bit as riveting as its predecessors and it handily subverts a lot of trilogy tropes. It wraps up honestly, if not especially neatly.

B002GY9F9K|2.0|I'm giving some feedback on the show (since I watched it all).<br /><br />First General Impression<br />I was excited to see another series that would match the greatness of \\"Merlin,\\" however, I was deceived. When I watched the first episode, I was like: \\"Oooo, the main character is witty, helpful and knows how to build a bridge.\\" As it progressed, I got kind of bored because the SURPRISE parts where Richard stumbles across Kahlan and where he finds out that his father wasn't his father were BLAND. Including the scene where his brother would turn against him and accuse him of killing his father were really stiff. When it finally got to Zedd's appearance, I started liking it and getting into it again. The other supporting characters were okay, some of them fit and the others didn't. At least there were more magical effects in this show but... it would've been nice if they showed more monsters in a better light with more animation effects.<br /><br />General Impression on the Characters (MASSIVE SPOILERS--Don't read if you haven't gotten passed season 1 or 2; maybe even 3)<br />Richard--a bit lack luster in most parts. I love that he is impulsive and does things his own way regardless of warnings. His character had more of a stronger audience  allure. I think he is the only one that really takes charge of anything without much complaint, unlike the others. It also helps that he was well built ;) jk But its good that they picked a good looking actor who had more attributes about him other than his looks because that's where most shows fail.<br /><br />Kahlan--it was nice to see a female character (whose in the lead), actually know what she's doing. She is stubborn just like Richard and had a sharp audience allure. However, as the series progressed... I kind of lost interest in her. I know it was important to introduce her struggles as a Confessor... but that was waaaay over played. Especially when she faltered in helping her friends when they needed her help. Her character seems defective.<br /><br />Zedd--LOVE HIM! He's just a LOVEABLE crazy ol' bat. lol :) Though, I do find him a bit bland when he finally reveals that he's Richard's grandfather. In addition, when he really gets to see his daughter again before the Mord Sith's kill her. By far he's the only one that shows a lot of magical influence throughout their adventure/travels together.<br /><br />Darken Rahl--his character also seemed defective like Kahlan's. His general appearance did fit the role of a sinister villain, though. I just wish that he had more flavor to him, other than just focusing on the \\"Confessor this, confessor that.\\" Plus, that episode where Richard accidentally goes through a time rift where Kahlan is impregnated by Darken Rahl... is disturbing. Even finding out that Richard and Rahl are half brothers is a bit \\"eh.\\" But I do credit them creating a ying and yang effect.<br /><br />Cara (Mord Sith; later to be \\"former\\" and a baneling)--I didn't care for her AT ALL. I was confused when they actually conformed her into being a \\"Good Guy,\\" after she's brought back from the dead later in the seasons. I also didn't care for her background... it was like they slapped it together to give her more depth.<br /><br />Mord Sith's--one word... DISGUSTING. The general outlook of the Mord Sith's just looked like a band of dominatrix's, which was probably the producers intention... Although, I could've gone without another guy's fantasy of \\"girl on girl.\\" I could understand the Mord Sith's being girl toys for Darken Rahl since he owned them but it was too much for the other implications. Even their sticks/rods of torture were lame. Yeah, sure they had some kind of \\"magic\\" to them but it was all blah. Their breath of light special technique was the only interesting thing about their overall influence in the show.<br /><br />Supporting Characters--the supporting characters did do their part in this show. Although, the girl playing Richards sister and mother were REALLYweak. Zedd's old friend was a good addition to his characters background, though. The actor who played as the \\"Magic Map\\" creator was really well done. The bounty hunters were bland. The underworld scenes later in the seasons were really just \\"eh.\\" Even the flash backs involving Richard and Rahl's father were kind of stiff. Plus, the part where Rahl and Richards father disguises himself as Zedd when Zedd was young and kills Zedds father in order to keep him from killing Rahl as a baby was just \\"ugh.\\"<br /><br />Special Effects Characters(Monsters)--the monsters didn't really shine in this show. Well, they didn't really get SHOWN much at all when there was an attack going on. I think they really should've had more involvement with monsters, other than leaving them in the background. The banelings were the only greatest part played as monsters, eating other people to be able to live.<br /><br />Other Impressions of the Show<br />I think the show is a normal good thrill TV series. I did love that there were stronger character personalities. I also enjoyed that there were more fighting scenes added into the story plot as well. I do wish that they could've added more spice to the animation effects. Merlin got away with using minimal involvement but Legend of the Seeker really need more of an \\"UMPH!\\" For the villains, the consistency of their characters didn't really work out well. Even the part where Richard gets stuck in a temple with women who are over 300yrs old felt like they just threw it in to keep the story going. Plus, the parts involving Kahlan in the beginning were okay but as it progressed, it just got awful. Even the Mord Sith's became really useless and not really needed. Darken Rahl's character also seemed to go off rails as they reached the last final episodes in the series.<br /><br />Do I recommend this show? If your looking for a rustic and more realism witty comedy, then yes. I just think they could've done more in certain areas. But it was good for the most part and the story line is somewhat stable. Just stick to what interests you and you may come to love it.
B0038M61I2|5.0|This is a really great album but it needs to be listened to in the room on a high fidelity system.  The subtleties of the album are what makes it really great and you are not going to get that listening to it as background.

0345803485|1.0|This book has all the touchstones of truly bad writing: repetitive, hyperbolic adjectives, annoyingly demanding adverbs, uninspired sentence structure, split infinitives and a kind of breathless self-preening style. I couldn't finish the thing; I defy anyone who loves good writing to do so.<br /><br />The attention that is going to this book's author should instead be directed toward Roberta Lee, whose vastly under-appreciated Suburban Sprawl series does everything 50 Shades tries to do, but does it in sparkling prose, with humor and an absolutely erotic twist.<br /><br />Don't buy this book. Buy the first book in Roberta Lee's Suburban Sprawl series,[[ASIN:1441461876 The Liar's Guide]], instead. Then tell everyone you know to do the same. Instead of following the crowd, start your own parade!
B0062HG2KM|4.0|The series has taken some serious turns since the beginning. The action is top notch. The suspense is great. The story line is getting more twisted than a pretzel in a tornado! Every show has its ups and downs but after devouring almost 4 seasons of this show it has very few down moments. External and internal conflict drives the show, and every character is a big part of the story line. A complete cast and complete very well written episode after episode. I thought the show would suffer as the plot lines were forced but everything plays out well and I can't wait for the next ep to start.<br />Side note - I saw a guy from a local MC wearing a cut the other day. Driving a harley with ape hangers and he had a small SOA sticker on his helmet. Now that speaks authenticity to me, when a real MC member is such a fan.<br />I don't pay for muchon amazon instant but I will keep buying SOA as long as they keep making it.
1440503257|5.0|This might not be an \\"official\\" Harry Potter cookbook, but it is officially great by my standards.  Any Harry Potter fan will just LOVE this cookbook.  It has every English delight one can dream up, and everything Harry Potter and friends did dine on...from haggis to pumpkin pastries.  This one is a keeper!

B000G6R7B8|5.0|one of the best all around watch movements ever made, I have had a $1000 automatic Gevril-2 which quit running after 2 years, only to find out it is $600 to repair it. I love these seiko 5 watches, choose your favorite design with confidence, the watch will last you a long time.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|I was intrigued by the story line of this film. I watched it over two nights. The first 43 minutes of this film are actually better than the last 51 minutes - which is not saying much.<br />You'd think that Keira Knightly, Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen could generate some sparks and venerable cinema.  Keira Knightly speaks in an atrocious Russian accent and she fades in and out of the accent.  Just this alone is cringe-worthy.  And right at the start of the film she has to contort her face and body to depict a woman in \\"hysteria\\".  That too is painful to watch, though not necessarily inaccurate.<br />The merit in this film is in the dialogue - and to comprehend the dialogue if you aren't versed in psychoanalysis, you might need more than one sitting.<br />The scenery was compellingly beautiful.<br /><br />More on this film later.
B007JCP8FE|3.0|I was more than a little underwhelmed with this record.  A few catchy songs.  A few times I thought I was listening to Elton John.  Overall...disappointed.

0307712893|5.0|\\"Winston's War\\" is, as its name implies, the story of Winston Churchill's involvement in World War II.  Winston passed through a series of phases during the course of the War.  At the start of the book, he provides Britain's spirit and backbone to stand alone against the might of Germany.  With the invasion of Russia and the attack on Pearl Harbor, Churchill became the alliance maker.  In seemingly constant motion, he bounded from conference to battlefront to home front.  At the summit level, he strove to keep Roosevelt and Stalin working together and kept FDR from falling too much under Stalin's sway.  Through it all he, through the force of his personality, he maintained an influence for Britain as its war contribution decreased in relationship to that of its allies.<br /><br />Author Max Hastings brings out domestic political challenges that Churchill confronted when the fortunes of war were unkind to Britain.  He survived a motion of censure during 1942, something most have forgotten in the shadow of his towering heroic stature.  I found this book to be fascinating.  The talented writing and the captivating tale it tells will draw the interest of any World War II buff.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game!! cant stop playing. easy to learn. east to play. one of the best games out there!! a true classic.
B006RED4GA|1.0|Absolutely boring. Not suspenseful or scary. I was hoping for a good \\"haunted house\\" story but this was just plain dull.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Truly well done - and an absolute steal for the price of the eBook!  Read this and immediately get the prequel.  You won't be disappointed.  Can't wait for the next one!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG that book is amazing! I have never read a book like that before. It is filled with exitment and archery. I love archery. Archery is my passion. There is nothing more that I like than archery and The Hunger Games.  ;^]
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney was always in her comfort zone when singing Gospel - she loved singing for God.  Whitney's voice is beautiful, filled with emotion and her love reaches out and touches you with this album.  I have always enjoyed watching the movie.  Having the soundtrack CD makes it all the more special.  Thank you, Whitney.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like it so far only had it for a few days.I don't care for some of the games.My daughter has it and likes it also.
0345803485|4.0|Yes, I caved. I felt so out of the loop not choosing to read Twilight or Hunger Games (thank goodness) that I figured why not?!?! Let me preface my review with the fact I have NEVER read a romance novel in my life- was just never \\"my thing\\" (pun intended).<br /><br />First, let's approach this book at what it is, entertainment. This book will by no means win any literary achievements so I think once we take that off the table and look at the book for what it really is, it will make better sense. This book is certainly not the worst book but it is far from a great book.  The writing was mediocre. E.L. James needs to invest in a Thesaurus, I am sure they have them in England, and get more acquainted with American terminology since it's setting is Seattle. Her repetitive way to describes elements in the story led me to believe she really a) did not know how to develop a character, scene, etc. or b) did not seem to care to develop those areas. Yes, I did begin to roll my eyes at the inner goddess references after a while.<br /><br />In a nutshell:<br />Will it win literary awards? No. But neither will Twilight, Hunger Games or any other fad series out here. I moved passed the writing and focused on the story- there IS one, beyond what you think of this book.<br /><br />Was it entertaining? Yes. Sometimes more than others.<br /><br />Will I read the remaining 2 books? Ordered them today. Come on, good reading by the pool material.<br /><br />It's really a harmless read; worst case scenario is many couples have an improved sex life now that women have found their inner goddess.....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a whole. heck of a lot of fun. from farming to fishing to building. its just addicting
B005VPRFSY|5.0|I bought this set and have played with it for a while. I have really enjoyed it so far. The escape pod is one of the best small lego vehicles I have seen in a long time. The cabin fits both C3-PO and R2-D2. Also, the two droids are really cool. The C3-PO actually had eyes and the mid-section reveals his wiring. Also, R2 still has movable legs. The Sand troopers are the best part of the set. One has an orange sash on his shoulder and the other has a white one. The troopers are worn and weathered looking so that you get the impression that they have actually been in battle. The speeder is basic and ok, but it is a minor feature of the set. This set is worth the purchase just because of the four mini figures. Trust me, this is one of the best Star Wars sets I have bought in a while.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Amazing that this author is being rewarded for her lack of imagination.  Repetitious beyond belief and the third book was painfully slow and cheesy.  I only read it in hopes there was some ultimate redeeming ending I was so sick of it half way through.  No such luck.  Enjoyed the uniqueness of the first book - after that the author is just taking advantage of the hype.  Interesting publicity ploy isn't it to release all 3 books at once - suckers you right into thinking you have to read them all.  Second book begins the crazy repetition - so unrealistic it doesn't even make a fun fantasy.  If they make a movie out of this it will be a travesty.  PS  I read these books on a dare if you wonder why I wasted my time getting through them.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|This set is pretty nice considering how cheap it is to buy. The set costs twelve dollars and actually is a really good product for something that cheap. I bought the set mainly for Captain America and was surprised because the motorcycle is really nice as well. The Captain America minifigure is really cool; he does not have a helmet but he does have a really good shield. The shield has a spot for him to hold it on the back, and it does not weigh his arm down. The nice thing about the motorcycle is that there is a place on the back (you can just barely see it in the picture, it is the black piece on top) to put Captain America's shield. It may not be from the 'Captain America' movie or from \\"The Avengers\\" but it looks really nice that way. The aliens are still really nice figures as well. The small aircraft that the commander alien has is easy to build and holds together well; the movable wings stay stationary while playing but they are still easily moved. The small launcher \\"base\\" is very basic. It just has enough space for a figure to stand there and then there is the missile (the height can be adjusted for aiming). This set may be very small but it has a lot of really cool features for a twelve dollar set; I highly recommend it. Besides, how else will you get a Captain America minifigure?
B005LAJ1PE|4.0|I'm so glad I started watching this when it first came on.  Very different type of show.  Is this dvd only one episode?  It says run time is 60 minutes.  I really want the whole season, not one episode.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Up until now, we've been a little disappointed in the 3D movies.  This new release of \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is exactly what we were hoping for in a 3D movie.  Not only good depth but things jumping out at you! Of all the movies in 3D that we've purchased this had the best 3D effects followed by Avatar.  I wish Hollywood would realize we want something besides \\"depth\\" in a 3D movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and easy games for all age's. love the availability of the instructions. everything is easy to use and it is such a great price. it's free.
0525478817|5.0|This is a long review, just sayin'<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars has been out for a few months now and I'm a little late to the game, but better late than never, right?! This is a book that has and will evoke very intense emotions and thoughts, both positive and negative. I've read many reviews ranging from DNF to 5++++ stars, pre-reading and post-reading, and I've seen some very compelling arguments for the negative and the positive. I am in the latter category having loved this book and have a lot to say as to why. In fact, I find I have a lot to say about the book in general and the passion/anger/sadness/etc it has produced in readers. So, with that being said, I have no idea how long or short this review will be (turns out it's very long), how analytical or explicative I may get (spoiler alert: very), or if it will be remotely helpful (probably not *shrugs*). I always aim to write helpful reviews, to help readers determine whether a book is worth the read, but in the case of this book I think I must be selfish and write this review first for me, simply so that I can get all my thoughts down.<br /><br />If you really just want the gist of my thoughts and really do not want to read the whole thing (and good Lord, I don't blame you), then here you go, the important things:<br />The Fault In Our Stars is a superbly written novel that will make you cry, make you laugh and hopefully leave you thoughtful, but never really leave you. With compelling characters, an addictive romance and an unforgettable voice, John Green has created a story that is as touching as it is electric, funny as it is thought-provoking and completely captivating. A must read. 5 Cupcakes<br />...there you go, the important highlights of my review. Now, if you actually want to stick around for the rest of my ramblings (YAY! you if ya do) then please proceed......<br /><br />I'm not going to spend too much time on a book summary; I think the blurb above does a great job of that. And besides, how does one really sum up this book without including spoilers? This is a book about a sixteen year old girl, Hazel, who is dying of cancer. She meets Augustus, a cancer survivor. They fall in love. People die. Heartache and grief ensue. Snarky humor and introspective honesty is used to deal with this heartache, grief and pain. Oh, and a heck of a lot of stuff happens between page one and page 313...okay, so apparently that's how one summarizes this book without being spoilery.<br /><br />This is a cancer book that isn't a cancer book, because like Hazel says \\"...cancer books suck\\" (pg 48). And perhaps they do. There is no shortage of YA \\"cancer books\\", all approaching the topic in their own ways (some with humor, some with lighthearted fluff, some full of sarcasm, some full of uplifting joy), none right or wrong. So does John Green really bring anything new to table with his non-cancer cancer book? For me (and really, I can only answer this question for myself), yes, yes he does. The newness does not necessarily come from his use of acerbic wit or his very intelligent, snarky and mature teenage characters or his rollercoaster storyline. No, the newness (again for me) comes from the way this humor, these characters, this story moved me, touched me, captured me in ways that no other book like it ever has. Will all readers experience the same emotions, affects, thoughts as me? Of course not. But readers will feel something. This book will evoke strong, thought-provoking emotions and thoughts. Good or bad, positive or negative, these emotions will be powerful enough that, based on the many varying reviews I've read, readers will want and need to talk about them. And isn't that in itself an impressive and original feat?<br /><br />This isn't always an easy story to read. Enjoyable and entertaining, yes. But not always easy. There's a relentlessness to it that can be hard to take (at times unbearable) and at times I had to close the book and walk away for a while. Such islife. One of the things that often pops up in reviews of this book is the idea that perhaps John Green has no right to write a cancer book, especially one that laughs at the general idea of cancer books, simply because he has not personally experienced what he writes about. Now, I'm not here to discuss who has the right to write about what because that's a topic that needs its own place and time for discussion. But, I do get this criticism and concern and I'll admit that this line of thinking crossed my mind several times while reading the book. But then I remembered the author's note Green includes in the beginning of the book, one that says \\"This book is a work of fiction. I made it up\\" (Author's Note). This story isn't real, the characters aren't real, no matter how real it all may seem (and we want it to feel real, don't we?), but that doesn't mean what this book makes us feel isn't any less real. I really had to place myself in this mindset before the book simply became Too Much and before I could truly enjoy it for what it is and not for what I thought it should be.<br /><br />And what is, is a story that is eloquent in its devastation, poignant in its humor and unforgiving in its honesty. This is a book that unabashedly asks a lot of its readers. It asks them first and foremost to remember that it is a work of fiction, second it ask them to remain open to all the possible emotions and thoughts it may evoke and to use them as needed, and thirdly, it asks them to take the characters for who they are and not who you want them to be, need them to be or think they should be.<br /><br />Green has created very complex and layered characters. Hazel and Augustus are both highly intelligent, sarcastic and snarky to the bone and unflinchingly honest. But where Augustus' personality and charm (he has a ton) is larger than life big and loud, Hazel's personality is full of quiet subtlety and unassuming boldness. Are they always easy to love? No, but therein lays their realism. I didn't always like Augustus' arrogance or Hazel's judgmental tendencies, but I love the fact that Green makes it okay for me to not always like these characters. Green doesn't use their cancer has a way to constantly draw on the sympathies of his readers. These are imperfect, flawed, often frustrating characters and I wouldn't want them any other way. Hazel and Augustus' friendship and romance is wonderfully written. This is a relationship that unfolds naturally and without pretense.<br /><br />The teenage characters in this book often talk a bit verbosely, with big, intelligent vocabularies and insightful soliloquies...think Dawson's Creek. Some readers may find this unrealistic and inappropriate. I find it pretty darn awesome. Why shouldn't teenagers talk and think in this way? Especially teenagers who are literally faced with and contemplating life's biggest and scariest questions.<br /><br />With books that deal with heavy stuff, like cancer, readers often associate them with life lessons. The characters in TFIOS often make fun of this very notion (and in very laugh out loud ways, I might add), which is something in itself that I've noticed sparks a lot of emotion in readers (again, good and bad). Personally, I didn't mind this dark humor and honesty. But it does lead to the question- What does this book teach us? My answer: nothing or maybe everything. Honestly, I don't know. I'll admit that I'm usually the type of person that will analyze a book to death to find the \\"point\\", no matter how presumptuous that may make me. And I'm not the only one; I've noticed that many other people wonder the same thing about this particular book- What does it mean? What purpose does it have? What glorious life lessons am I supposed to walk away with? Again, I can only speak for myself. The only lesson I walked away with is that there are no lessons. There is no glorious truth or lesson to learn from watching a teenager waste away painfully from cancer. There are no uplifting encouragements that will truly offer comfort to those left behind. And questions don't always need answers.<br /><br />And questions abound in this book. Big, life altering questions. Small seemingly insignificant questions. Questions about beginnings, about endings, about long afters. I love questions, but I crave answers, so I was surprised to find that I didn't mind the lack of answers. In fact, I think answers would ruin the story for me. There's something utterly terrifying, but completely captivating about a question that you know will never truly be answered. And in the end, for me, this book isn't about the answers; it's about how the questions change and affect the characters.<br /><br />MY FINAL THOUGHTS: The Fault In Our Stars is a book that leaves a mark, whether that mark comes in the form of a breathtaking ache of a beautiful heartbreak or the blow of a sucker punch in the gut or the sting of a slap in the face, will depend on the reader. This reader has been marked by all three. Funny, Touching, Surprising, Powerful...I could go on with the adjectives, but I won't.

B004132HZS|5.0|New Sherlock series is dark, intriguing, funny and will have you unable to tear your eyes off the screen!<br /><br />Sherlock is hardly new on the front of retellings of the classic A.C. Doyle stories. Many versions have reached us - most recently a BBC-series. Currently two seasons with three episodes, Sherlock places the quirky detective and his beloved sidekick Watson in modern-day London to solve mysteries. This in itself might not sound special, but Steven Moffat (Dr. Who) has managed to create a new and compelling (anti)hero in a visually stunning, off-center TV-show.<br /><br />Each episode runs for one-and-a-half hours, with one main plot-point. Episodes often hint at original tellings of Doyle - titles of episodes, characters, jokes and events become referential. Viewers who have read Holmes and are in the know recognize these, yet ones who have never read Holmes are not missing out - the main stories are new to everyone.<br /><br />Next to new story lines, characters are also different than one might know them. Sherlock is a sociopath with a knack for details. Watson is a war-veteran with a need for action and often a mediator between Sherlock and the people he offends. The cast for these parts is particularly strong, with newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock and Martin Freeman as Watson. Next to giving strong performances, both actors physically suit their parts perfectly. Cumberbatch in particular with his unusual features, pale skin and raven hair that add to the fascination of his Sherlock.<br /><br />The series works on a pure visual level too. Shots are original and add to the narrative. Moody environments with beautiful colors and gorgeous angles translate Sherlocks state of mind, better than he could ever do with words. Trips through London become exciting and sitting in a cab has never looked so good.<br /><br />Initially there seemed to be some visual exploring, with close-ups and explanatory letters on-screen, in an attempt to find a uniquevoice for the characters quick mind. This felt out of place and has been disappearing as a technique. This search for a voice for the show has resulted in giving it some instability throughout its two-season run. Not all episodes have been equally strong. There have been predictable outcomes, wallowing in Sherlocks cockiness and uninteresting side-characters.<br /><br />All in all, the trip-ups are forgivable and forgettable. Everyone makes mistakes and the next episode is sure to knock you off your feet!

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Wow -- This book was hot and intense! I read all 350+ pages in less than a day. The comparisons to Fifty Shades of Grey are obvious: Uber-hot, young, billionaire with control issues stemming from an abusive past meets younger woman who is the first to challenge him and make him try for \\"more\\". There is very little mention of the BDSM lifestyle that Fifty is known for, but the possessiveness and control-freak attitude is there. As is the feeling that it all happened awfully fast. I read all three books in the Fifty Shades series recently, so it was fresh in my mind and hard not to see the resemblance. But I say, who cares? I loved Fifty and I was more than happy to get that feeling back again with Gideon and Eva in Bared to You. There's just something about a tortured man who needs you and is willing to do anything to have you. Sylvia Day's concept may not be original, but her writing is oh-so compelling, you just don't care. Her book has the polish and readability that Fifty Shades often lacks. Plus, it doesn't hurt that it is filled with super-hot, raw sex, the kind that makes you squirm just to read it. \\"What you make me feel, Eva...it hurts...it's wonderful\\" You can't help but feel some of that wonderful pain right along with him. Loved it.<br />For anyone who finished reading the Fifty series and is missing it...Bared to You is a must read. 4.5 stars.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|Most car stereos that claim to work with the iPhone/iPad can't provide enough power to actually charge the iPhone/iPad and talk to it at the same time. This adapter has a micro-usb port on the side that you can plug into your lighter to power your iPhone/iPad while it also can plug into your stereo or car ODB2 port.<br /><br />I use it to connect my iPad to the ODB2 port in my truck since the computer can't power an iPad through the ODB2 port.<br /><br />You will need to buy a micro-USB cable which is not the same as the more common mini-USB.
B007HJ98XC|5.0|This is one of the best book adaptions to film ever made!  Fans of the Fire and Ice book series will enjoy this television series.  It is very well made, the acting is excellent, and it come together as a very believable story and you quickly become involved in the characters lives.  Fans of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" would also enjoy this series.
B001MUK7GY|1.0|I mistakenly purchased it from someone who imports the blurays  from the UK  and sales them here on Amazon. The set I received was of very poor quality. The film looks as if it was just copied over from DVD and put on a blueray disk.  Very grainy picture,  it's to my belief most region free or UK imports are pirated movies. Do not be fooled, quality is not the same.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|What a gem!  I call this \\"music my parents would love\\", and I mean that in a good great way.  It is rich in blues/rock influence.  These hometown country kids were raised right in music and their knowledge and maturity shows.  Let's start with the lead singer, Brittany Howard.  I have a feeling this girl doesn't even know how good she is.  She has a singing voice that is wise beyond her years: the metaphorical love child of Janis Joplin and Aretha Franklin.  She carries emotion when she sings, and you don't just listen to it, you feel it.  This girl has Soul, with a capital SOUL.  As for the music itself, the songs vary from Blues to Motown to good ol' Southern rock.  I challenge you to try and remain still while listening, because I'm quite sure it's impossible.  I can appreciate music that you know is meant to be listened to live, and this is one of them.  This is outdoor concert, cold beer in hand, dancing barefoot in the grass kind of music.  And this Southern transplant can appreciate that.  Oh did I mention they will be performing at Bonnaroo this year...which I will be attending.<br /><br />I can see this band going far and I hope they do.  My only fear is that their single, \\"Hold On\\" is the only single-capable song on the album.  Not to say that the other songs are not equally as good, possibly better, but I think it's the only song from this album that is current enough to make it onto the radio.<br />Again, I don't consider this a bad thing.  I think they will do amazingly within their own genre.  It's just not a widespread or youthful genre...therefore, they may go unknown with the larger crowd.  But hey, that's not a bad thing.<br />[...]
B006VUPCEM|4.0|Finally released is the self-titled debut album by the German melodic hard rock supergroup \\"Unisonic\\". Taking as basis the melodic hard rock/AOR project \\"Place Vendome\\", lead singer Michael Kiske, drummer Kostas Zafeiriou and bassist/songwriter Dennis Ward decided to raise the stakes by moving their formation to a full-time band. Entering the line-up was former \\"Krokus\\" guitarist Mandy Meyer and lately guitar legend Kai Hansen.<br /><br />So \\"Unisonic\\" is basically two former members of \\"Helloween\\" (Kiske and Hansen), two members of \\"Pink Cream 69\\" (Ward and Zafeiriou) and fromer \\"Krokus\\" guitarist. Songwriting-wise it is critical to point out that the foundation of \\"Unisonic\\"s sound is the hard rock of \\"Pink Cream 69\\", of course, without being absolute. The melodic lines seem to come out of a \\"Helloween\\" or \\"Gamma Ray\\" album, indeed, but the rhythm section, the rhythm guitars and the overall structure of the majority of their songs draws more towards hard rock than metal, one has to admit. Another way you could look at it, is that \\"Unisonic\\" is based on the more popular side of \\"Helloween\\" and \\"Gamma Ray\\", referencing such songs as \\"I want out\\" and \\"one with the world\\" as opposed to their faster/heavier material.<br /><br />From a melodic rock fan's perspective one is drawn to the subtlety and intensity of \\"Souls Alive\\", the upbeat and playful \\"Never too late\\", the dramatic but optimistic \\"I've tried\\" and the defiant \\"Renegade\\". Allow one for a brief moment to get personal and say that I gave \\"Unisonic\\" four our of five simply because I find Kiske's previous works (these being the two \\"Vendome\\" albums) in the melodic rock/hard rock genre to be slightly superior to this new album, although a solid rock offering. Overall, \\"Unisonic\\" needs no recommendation, it features an all star-line up and a long-overdue reunion of two legends of the scene- with that Kiske, Kai, Denis, Mandy and Kosta can not disappoint any fan of the genre.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|In all my time watching Director Cut movies, I've noticed there are two different types. The first is extra content that, sometimes without reason, someone thought would be too much for theatrical viewing. The other deals with extra story to it.<br />This is the second. Another thing I've noticed in the past few years is how, if there's quite a load of content added, it usually adds up to, at most, 17 minutes. In this case, make that 26.<br />Certain scenes that seemed to be missing a couple elements to make the scene whole get the extra bits and there's more comprehension and coherency. Other scenes seem to come out of nowhere, but make the story a little deeper anyway. Even the action itself gets a revamp and gets quicker and flashier, and, with the blu-ray upgrade, sharper. And I don't mean just the swords look sharper, either.<br />Sound-wise, the soundtrack is more noticeable due to soundloss yet is more intertwined, it seems like, with the appropriate scenes (the piano goes great with the poignant/slow moments, guitars and synths completely compatible with the HIGH-octane moments, etc.), and, I could be mistaken, but it also sounds a bit more tweaked and remixed.<br />From the start, I couldn't help but notice a few nods to the Bible, either, and I'm pretty sure no one meant to add them, but they're there anyway. Such as how the kids get infected first with GeoStigma, an echo of how the Bible says that whenever any kind of social evil happens, the kids are always the first to suffer for it. And the water that heals the sick? Brings to mind one of the nicknames for Jesus, Living Water. Not to mention how Kadaj sounds like nothing but a cultic teacher (albeit, one that's anti-environment). Oh, yes, and the moment when Kadaj becomes Sephiroth, on the DVD, it was exciting. On Blu-ray, it somehow gave me chills, possibly because the vocals are refined with the graphics details redefined. And that battle between the two? Much darker than I'd anticipated (not visually, but thematically) and one attack that loosened my jaw on the DVD completely dropped my jaw on Blu-ray. Extended and tweaked and enjoyed beyond belief.<br />When all's said and done (and there are excellent little details that add to the big bag of mixed moments and expert Asian storytelling), it was worth checking out the special features, especially the anime titled On the Way To A Smile: Denzel.y, but thematically) and one attack that loosened my jaw on the DVD completely dropped my jaw on Blu-ray.

B0015KGJMM|5.0|This is a hybrid CD/Super audio CD (SACD).<br />Refreshing interpretation of Handel's Water music and Music of the Royal Fireworks. The CD layer already sounds very good, but the SACD stereo and multichannel layers really shine. Great performance and great recording. The Alia Vox label maintains a very high standard and this is a prime example of it.
0345803485|1.0|I read the chapters that are available free on the product page.<br />All I kept thinking throughout was: \\"God, this is like reading 5 pages of that one uninteresting Facebook friend's posts when they feel the need to keep you up to speed with exactly what they're watching on television, or how many cups of tea they've had today.\\"<br />Honestly? Don't waste your time. If you really must read it, skip straight to the sex.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|An unpologetic, almost gloating, tale of killing \\"bad guys\\" and the macho, frat boy world of Navy SEALS.  Poorly written.  You do learn a little about their weapons and tactics which is the only thing that makes this book worthwhile.
B004SUDQE0|5.0|This has long been one of my favorite movies--in fact, I watched it again just a couple of nights ago.  Although all of the acting in this movie is top notch, I especially like the relationship that exists, and develops, between Rev. Jones and Morgan the Goat.  Both characters are played exceedingly well, but I especially like the great performance of Rev. Jones (played by Kenneth Griffith)--in particular the sermon that he delivers near the end that enables, even motivates, the villagers--on a Sunday--to make their hill into a \\"true\\" (from an English standpoint) mountain.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app isn't really hard but its just so convusing.I just hate that you have to wait to gain all the money to get another part of the game.But other then that I will give it a 5 star rating.  :-)

B001BZRUR4|4.0|First off, I have to give props to Markus Zusak. I have read The Book Thief and just finished I Am the Messenger and I love his writing style.<br /><br />As for this book, I fell into it. It grabbed hold of me and I loved every minute of it until the very end. The ending was a little too cliche and easy for me. After all that Ed went through, I felt he deserved a better ending, something more deep and meaningful.<br /><br />This story is about a 19 year old Australian taxi driver named Ed Kennedy who stops a bank robber. His life is very average and kind of boring up until this point. He lives in what he describes as a shack with a 17 year old dog named the Doorman (love that name!) and the highlight of his life is playing cards with his three friends; Audrey, Marv and Ritchie. Not long after stopping the robber, Ed receives a playing card (an Ace) in the mail with three addresses and times written on it. Of course Ed visits the addresses at the specified times and learns that there is something important he needs to do at each address.<br /><br />The story follows Ed on his journey through completing the tasks at each address. He then gets 3 other Aces with odd clues on each. At the end, he receives one other card but I'll let you read the book to find out which it is. Ed's life takes on much more meaning and the story really evolves his character so far that I really felt like I knew him. This story moved me to tears a few times and made my heart full at others. Like I said before, I love Markus Zusak's writing. His words get inside of me and play with my emotions.<br /><br />I really did like this book and thought I would love it but the ending did make me drop one star from my rating. I understand why it was written the way it was but I wish it would have been a little more unpredictable. Overall though, this is a wonderful, moving story that I would suggest to anyone.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it all the time.  Fantastic for research.  Excellent ancillary web apps to compliment the app as well. Works as designed and advertised.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the perfect middle to the Hunger Games story arc. It was just as exciting and surprising as any part of the story. It left me wanting more.... immediately.
0345803485|5.0|I'm not sure where to begin. I have never felt compelled to write a review on any book I've read - even ones I've loved - until now. I will start by saying that I pity those who decided not to read this book simply based on someone else's bad review. Sure, this book isn't for everyone, but you don't know until you try reading it...and hey, you might just like it. Or love it, and that's okay! I have never read a BDSM book before, and I probably never would have read this book if not for it's connection to Twilight, which I am a fan of (since it originated as a Twilight Fan Fiction). This book could easily be loved by even those who loathe Twilight. Yes, it's sexy, raunchy even, but what's wrong with that? The reader needs to open their mind to the story and forget the stigma that society has on sex -  particularly, enjoying sex. If you're the type of person who analyzes fiction stories in a literal sense, then this may not be for you - and maybe fiction in general isn't for you. Just keep in mind that ultimately it is a story of two people who are learning from each other. If you read this book, and I highly recommend that you do, you might even learn something about yourself!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|No, it didn't end as I'd expected. Nevertheless, it was fitting and beautiful. I am so glad that I read this series. Very few books move me like The Hunger Games did. Even as I kept telling myself that it was all fantasy, I could see see the parallels to real life events - so horrifying. How I wish it weren't so.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|Bought the movie because I was taken in by the stellar cast. Do not make the same mistake, ever!!  The movie moved along at a torturously slow pace and is a good cure for insomnia. Even the soundtrack and sound effects are muffled n obviously third rate. If u must get this movie, save some money n get the DVD. The bluray is not HD and is so blurry I had to check the box to make sure I had not inserted a DVD by mistake.<br /><br />Still wondering why established actors will get themselves involved in such a pathetic excuse for a movie.<br /><br />One of the worst movies on bluray I have purchased in the last 3 years. YUCKS!
B00005N6KG|2.0|Decent treble and highs, absolutely no base.  If you are looking for something cheap and cheerful fine, otherwise, would recommend senheisers running headphones for much better performance.
B004LWZW4C|2.0|Okay, here's the deal: Firstly, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS isn't a particularly good film to begin with. Aside from the great work put in by Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, there's no really good performance work within the film. It's a criminal waste of talent of Rose Byrne, who is so darn good in DAMAGES, as well as Oliver Platt, who is a terrific character actor. James McAvoy is pretty charmless and Kevin Bacon is really phoning this one in.<br /><br />Secondly, it's a very uneven film. While, at the very least, the first two X-Men films worked on more than one level while maintaining a consistent narrative, this film is far too ambitious for its own good, and it shows. It wavers between being a 60's mod super spy throwback, a pseudo-historical drama, a misfit teen romance, a rousing big-budget effects extravaganza, a frenemy-type relationship drama with some homoerotic subtext (come on, you can't tell me that scene with Charles, Erik and Angel wasn't a little kinky and the film could have actually used more of that), and a revenge thriller all in one. And sadly, very few of these aspects work.<br /><br />Third, the characters thrown in are, for the most part, poorly chosen (this is where the really geeky stuff starts). The only ones that were chosen that worked in some kind of continuity were Darwin, Banshee and Beast. The choice of Sebastian Shaw as villain is terrible, particularly since he was also retcon-ed as a former Nazi geneticist. Shaw is a man of wealth and priviledge, and it's his greed and his sense of entitlement that makes him a villain. If they wanted to go down this road, the much better and much less nonsensical villain would have been Nathaniel Essex aka Mr. Sinister. He IS a geneticist in Marvel continuity and has lived for a VERY long time.<br /><br />However, this is not the worst part. What IS the worst part is how this ENTIRE film is completely undone and invalidated in less than ten seconds for nothing more that a wink and an extremely cheap laugh: Hugh Jackman in a cameo as Wolverine.<br /><br />Why does this invalidate this film's existence? Prepare yourself for the threshold of geek rage. Turn back now if you might be upset or confused. With Hugh Jackman appearing as Wolverine/Logan/James Howlett in a 10-second cameo, it takes already-established continuity within Fox's X-Franchise and UTTERLY DESTROYS IT. The film is set during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. If you've seen X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (and I have, and it's not as bad as you might think if you go in expecting nothing), you see two ancillary characters: Scott Summers aka Cyclops and Emma Frost. If you know your comic continuity, you know that Scott Summers is Alex Summers aka Havok's older brother. OLDER BROTHER. And if we're to assume that the majority of WOLVERINE took place in the late 70's to early 80's, it would be impossible to make heads or tails that Scott Summers' younger brother was a teenager in the early 60's. But I'm willing to concede this point, since no one else (besides me) gave a crap about Cyclops in the other films. Also, we have a major character in Rose Byrne's Moira MacTaggert. This character also appeared in X-MEN: THE LAST STAND as played by the similarly lovely and talented Olivia Williams. In THE LAST STAND, she's decidedly Scottish. In this film, she is decidedly American, and since the original X-MEN film from 2000 took place \\"in the not-too distant future\\" and THE LAST STAND was released in 2006, that would make the 20-something Moira MacTaggert in FIRST CLASS at least 60 in 2006, but was played by the much younger Williams. However, I can concede that point as well, since that could be as much a fault of THE LAST STAND (which is a truly awful film, anyway) as it is here. And the relationship between Moira and Charles is important in continuity.<br /><br />I am NOT willing to concede this next point and this is the point where the entire franchise collapses in on itself like some kind of Hollywood singularity: In WOLVERINE, as I stated before, there is a cameo by Emma Frost. Again, with that film taking place in the late 70's/early 80's, we see Emma Frost as a teenager. In X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, she's played by a decidedly older January Jones. IN 1962. How can you have a major role in this film played by a different, older actress almost two decades earlier? BTW, is January Jones good in MAD MEN? Because she sucks rocks in everything else.<br /><br />Someone out there might say that this film somehow takes place in an \\"alternate timeline\\" akin to J.J. Abrams STAR TREK. I call B.S. to that specifically because they added a cameo by Hugh Jackman. It's not like Leonard Nimoy reprising Spock in Abrams' film since he plays a much older Spock. Fox was trying to link all the franchises together so they could continue milking cash from the X-Cow, but all they had to do was the same line with either a different actor (maybe Dougray Scott for you real film/X-MEN geeks?) or just show a hand with adamantium claws in the foreground and say the same line. That way... it makes a case for the \\"alternate timeline\\" option.<br /><br />Mostly, this film just upsets me because it's not very good, but it also upsets me because it can't even be bothered to respect the films, better or worse, that preceded it.<br /><br />But that's FOX for you. Show me a franchise they HAVE respected over the passage of time and I will salute you and do Numfar's Dance of Joy. I really don't think you'll find that, though.ngularity: In WOLVERINE, as I stated before, there is a cameo by Emma Frost.

B0053O89KG|4.0|The fourth season finale of CASTLE is approaching next week. It's been a fun season overall, but the last five or six episodes have been about the relationship between Castle and Beckett and it reaching a critical mass over whether or not they will remain platonic or become romantic.<br /><br />I know that this show is hoping to avoid the pitfalls of MOONLIGHTING and THE X-FILES becoming boring as the romantic/sexual tension between the two leads potentially disappears once they become romantically involved, but ENOUGH ALREADY. Too much of this season has been focusing on \\"Will they or won't they\\" being the arc between these two characters and it needs resolution. Hopefully, the season finale will finally resolve this, because if it continues to tease with the possibility of hot monkey love between Castle and Beckett, although I love this show, it's going to actually do more harm if it just drags it out and people, like myself, are going to start tuning out.<br /><br />Also, watching episodes of FIREFLY and DRIVE and the film SERENITY makes me long for the days when Nathan Fillion was a certified bad-a$$, so, I'm hoping that the following seasons actually make way for Castle to become more action-y. Perhaps having a romantic relationship with Beckett can cause that to come to greater fruition. She can train him how to respond to more physical demands. It wouldn't change the character terribly, or for the worse, because Fillion is a great romantic and comedic foil. I also know that this is potentially a problematic idea since Castle's greatest weapon is his mind, but that hasn't ever stopped Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />I'm not a contrarian and I do love this show, but this arc is becoming too frustrating. It's too ratings-centric with little regard for what fans really want to see. If it works between Castle and Beckett and that actually ends up helping the show and its narrative, great! If it works for them, and it hurts the show, they can at least say that they tried.<br /><br />Personally, I'm rooting for a relationship.ed.<br /><br />Personally, I'm rooting for a relationship.

0345803485|1.0|I have NEVER written a review, bad or otherwise, for a book.  This novel was so terrible I had to write one.  First of all I completely agree with the other negative reviews - all the points made about the book are exactly spot on. Oh, where to start...<br /><br />Anastasia Steele, the \\"heroine\\" of the story, is a complete and utter rip off of Stephanie Meyer's Bella Swan character - I mean down to the 'socially awkward, clumsy, thinks she is butt ugly but everyone else on the planet thinks she is hotter than hell', and as a side note, I thought Twilight was pretty badly written, but next to Fifty Shades it is a Shakespearean masterpiece.  Mrs. James also rips off the whole 'emailing made sexy with cutesy subject titles, and clever, witty, flirty wording' from Bridget Jones Diary, but in this novel, as opposed to B.J., the annoyingly stupid email flirting just never stops- I mean it is extremely irritating, and just dumb.  How are we as the readers suppose to believe that \\"Mr. Gray\\", as a completely self- made, conglomerate crazed, multi-millionaire by 27 individual, is engaging in endless email flirting, not to mention flying around chasing a naive 21 year old. Also every time \\"Ms. Steele\\" asks \\"Mr. Gray\\" about his day, he always replies with adjectives like boring, tedious, tediously boring, so boring and/or tedious I had to leave early.  Really? This very successful person finds his days as a millionaire, running his own huge empire as boring? How on earth did he become so successful then?<br /><br />Another reviewer made mention of this, but I have to expand on it- the 'inner goddess'/'subconscious' thing.  I found this just so annoying and cheesy, I would read these passages out loud to my husband for a laugh.  Throughout the book the author continuously uses this to describe how ms. Steele is feeling inside - her 'subconscious'.  Here are some excerpts (let's all laugh in unison):<br />'My subconscious peeks out from behind the couch, still registering shock on her harpy face'.<br />'My inner goddess in panting'.<br />'My inner goddes glows so bright she could light up Portland'.<br />'My inner goddes is jumping up and down, clapping her hands like a five year old'.<br />'My subconscious sounds sane and rational, not her usual snarky self'.<br />'My inner goddess sits in the lotus position looking serene except for the sly, self-congratulatory smile on her face'.<br />'My subconscious glares at me, wagging her long, skinny finger, then morphs into the scales of justice to remind me he could sue if I disclose too much'.<br />'My subconscious has her Munch's Scream face again'.<br />'My subconscious relaxes and then collapses, slumped in an old battered chair'.<br />And one more shining example TA-DAA: 'I try to calm down, to connect with my inner sub. She's there somewhere, hiding behind my inner goddess'.<br />If you thought it tedious reading these few excerpts from this novel, imagine reading a 514 page book, with these insanely cheesy lines written throughout.  I thought my 'inner goddess' was going to leap out the window any minute.  Every time I read one of these lines, I just wanted to put the book down. Truth be told, I did skip a chunk of the book towards the end.  This book is just so horrible.<br /><br />Another thing, if Ms. Steele bit her lower lip one more time, I really was going to dive out the nearest window.  The author made mention of this habit, which Mr. Gray found so erotic and exciting, over and over and over again throughout this book.  I mean she pointed this out to the reader, at least 100 times throughout the book.  Give me a break.  Am I suppose to get reved up, each and every time the author mentions Ms. Steele eating her bottom lip again?  And after each time she mentions it in the book, inevitably comes the description of Mr. Gray getting hot under the collar for Ms. Steele.  He then admonishes her for doing it, precisely because it does turn him on?  HUH???  I was bored to tears with this affectation.  Does the author believe that  the continuous mention of Ms. Steele's lip-biting, make for a novel characterized as 'erotic fiction'?  No maybe it was the scene when Mr. Gray has sex with Ms. Steele while she is in the middle of having her period.  This is sexy?  I thought I was going to barf when the author describes Mr. Gray pulling Ms. Steele's tampon out in the bathroom, and then afterwards, describing her blood on his privates.  Umm, this is just gross.<br /><br />The whole 'Mr. Gray/ Ms.Steele' throughout the novel.  These two will revert to calling each other by their surnames when things get really hot- okay, again really annoying and dumb after like the twentieth time, and don't forget about the emails!!!  Yet another boring mention throughout the book, the 'charged atmosphere' every time they are around each other.  I get it, I really do, but after it is mentioned a million times it gets tedious-JUST STOP.<br /><br />The contract that he wants her to sign, but she never actually does (unless I was comatose by that point).  After awhile, did it really matter if she \\"signed\\" the contract or not?  She was having sex with him, and doing practically everything that he wanted anyway, so what was with the whole 'please sign my contract' bit?  Again. Just annoying and stupid.<br /><br />Mr. Gray's PAST.  The author makes references and illusions to his PAST throughout the book. Okay, I get it.  From what I can understand, he had a somewhat abusive early childhood, while being raised by a \\"crackhead\\" mother.  She kicks it, and then he is adopted by a rich, wonderful, caring set of people.  That's it.  Then, when he is 15, a pedophile friend of his stepmother's starts using him for sex and introduces him to this D/S thing.  Okay.  I guess the author wants the reader to then deduce that this is why Mr. Gray is the way he is, and can apparently only engage in these kinds of relationships with others.  According to his character, he doesn't do 'vanilla sex', but the odd thing is, he is very unconvincing as this die-hard Dominant, who needs absolute control over his sex partner-, no love, no strings attached, no touching.  In another unconvincing side episode, he introduces Ms. Steele to his family after knowing her for maybe 2 weeks.  During the introductions, Mr. Gray's sister states that he has NEVER introduced any of his girlfriends to them, ever.  Okay.  So again, the author is trying to convince us of what exactly, that he is so taken with her so quickly, that he is rushing to make introductions, but he is still a bad- ass?  I was just confused.  Is Mr. Gray also schizo?  The characters in this novel in general are just not consistent, fleshed out, realistic, etc.  just really bad story-telling and writing.<br /><br />The ending.  Give me a break.  Ms. Steele gets upset that he belts her - after weeks of being involved with this twisted individual,  knowing how he gets off, consenting to the belting numerous times after being asked by Mr. Gray if its okay, counting out loud when he then does exactly what he told her he was going to do in his \\"Red Room of Pain\\" as the character calls it...she gets mad at him and stomps away in a huff, like a child, while he looks after her piningly.  She literally stomps away - leaves his apartment, walks out on him and I guess the relationship, and then cries a bunch.  Oh my God- just bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />This is suppose to be an erotic novel- again I just don't get it.  The sex seems are not bad (except the period one), but they certainly do not live up to the hype, AT ALL.  I have read many that are way better, and much more erotic than this one, with an actual storyline as well.<br /><br />I could go on and on- my best advice is to just borrow.  My mother-in-law lent the book to me- hehe.  Do not waste your money.
0307454568|5.0|I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical of this book.  Just from reading some of the reviews here, I was nervous that this would fall flat and be a dud--nothing more than tying up loose ends.  I'm pleased to add my 5 stars to the others here, because this book is far from being a dud.  If anything, it is just as intense and fast paced as its predecessors.  I loved it and highly recommend!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This is a story about Abby, a freshman at Eastern college, and a tattooed bad boy named Travis.  Abby and her best friend, America, travel far away from their home in Whichita so they can get away from Abby's gambling father and alcoholic mother.  Once at college, America meets Shepley, who takes both Abby and America to an underground fighting ring to watch his cousin, Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox, fight.  Once there, Abby not only gets splattered by blood, but also catches Travis' eye, as she's the only woman who is resists his charm to worm his way into her pants.  Through a bet, Abby ends up having to stay a month at Travis' apartment.  The month goes by with the roarings of a great tempest and in the end, will it leave them completely broken, or can they find love in each other's arms?<br /><br /> What I Liked:  I really enjoyed the supporting characters in the story.  Each had their own believable personality, especially America, Shepley, Finch, Brazil, Chris, and Parker (I like that they have crazy names too).  The change in Travis, from bad boy to faithful boyfriend was frought with bumps and blips, as would be in real life.  Both Travis and Abby are in such a well of pain at one point that I shed a couple of tears and my heart hurt for them.  Their romantic interlude is one gigantic rollar coaster ride, but that's also what makes the book really good.<br /><br /> What I Didn't Like:  Where do these college kids get all this money?! And also, Abby is 18 when they meet and she's 19 when the book ends (her birthday was about a week after she and Travis meets for the first time).  She and Travis move really fast in the book, though I guess it's possible to know your mind at 18 years of age, I just didn't know mine yet (Though I probably still don't hehe).  It was also unrealistic that Travis beat up so many people and never got in trouble/arrested, but that's part of their tempestuous relationship.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable book even if the setting is a bit unrealistic. I'd give it a 4 out of 5.

0143119680|5.0|Ever have one of those moments when you're in a bookstore, and one certain book just seems to call to you from the other side of the room, like it knows you're going to love it and should take it home with you?<br /><br />That's what Deborah Harkness's, \\"A Discover of Witches\\", did to me when I was nosing through the shelves in one of those little book stores inside NY Penn Station a few weeks ago. I was just there, waiting for my train back to New Jersey, when my friend suggested we stop inside the book store and nose around. Now I will never turn down a chance to stop inside a book store. There are so few left, and NONE in my area of NJ, so I needed my fix of being surrounded by books.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll walk into a place, and SOMETHING tells me I should look over here or look over there. Experience has told me to listen to that something, as something I may not know that I'm looking for, or sometimes AM looking for, is usually where that something tells me to go.<br /><br />This was one of those times. And I am so glad I listened to that something.<br /><br />This book is definetely a page turner, and I found myself at times going back a few pages to confirm what I just read. I fell hard for Diana and Matthew's relationship, and to be honest, I'm glad one certain event did not happen in this first book. It'll make when it does finally happen in the upcoming books that much more... well... MORE.<br /><br />The battles between witches, vampires, and daemons, the Congregation, Knights of Lazerus, the plays on the sense of taste, touch, and smell ( I seriously need to pick up a clove scented candle now! ). And it's obvious that Harkness REALLY did her homework when working on this book. I'm not sure too many other people would know what an oubliette is ( unless they were fans of the movie, \\"Labyrinth\\". ^^; ). She made great use of it.<br /><br />Over all, this is a beautiful read, and I cannot wait for the second book, \\"Shadow of Night\\", to come out this summer.r.

0545265355|5.0|My 16 year old daughter is not big on reading books, but she finished the 1st of this 3 book series in about 3 days and she is at school until 6pm during the week! She loved the book and has excitedly begun reading the 2nd one. My daughter said the book gives great insight on the emotions of the characters, unlike the movie. Now my 10 year old son wants to read them!

B0054W4JQK|5.0|This Book is fantastic, it has many twists in it.It keeps you wondering how it is going to turn out. I found myself thinking about this character, how weird it would be if it really happened.In the end I just had to keep reading until I finished it. I have recommended it to many people. I am normally a murder mystery reader, but found this to excellent. Enjoy.
B005POK858|5.0|We know the app doesnt run well if at all on Droid; so don't download it! what is the point of artificially downgrading an otherwise great game bc it doesn't happen to run on your particular phone.

1449529259|5.0|Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) was an English writer, who ultimately converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism. Two of his more famous works are [[ASIN:1463704569 Heretics]] and [[ASIN:1619491443 The Everlasting Man]]. He indicated in the Preface that \\"This book is meant to be a companion to 'Heretics,' and to put the positive side in addition to the negative... It is the purpose of the writer to attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian Faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.\\"<br /><br />He suggests that \\"We have found all the questions that can be found. It is time we gave up looking for questions and began looking for answers.\\" (Ch. III) He later confides, \\"This was my first conviction... I had always believed that the world involved magic: now I thought that perhaps it involved a magician.\\" (Ch. IV)<br /><br />He argues that \\"Christianity is a sword which separates and sets free. No other philosophy makes God actually rejoice in the separation of the universe into living souls. But according to orthodox Christianity this separation between God and man is sacred, because this is eternal.\\" (Ch. VIII)<br /><br />He summarizes, \\"I have dealt with such typical triads of doubt in order to convey the main contention---that my own case for Christianity is rational; but it is not simple.\\" (Ch. IX) He concludes with the thought, \\"Joy, which was the small publicity of the pagan, is the gigantic secret of the Christian.\\" (Ch. IX)<br /><br />Chesterton's more languid, \\"literary\\" style may bore some modern readers; but he is one of those Christian writers whose work will still be revered when all of the latest \\"Christian bestsellers\\" have been forgotten.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like all the Angry Birds franchise, this game is entertaining, engaging, and challenging.<br /><br />But there's a problem with Amazon Appstore for Android. Its latest version of AB Rio is 1.4.3. Quite some time ago, I was upgraded to 1.4.4 through the Google Play appstore, and now I'm getting constant reminders from Amazon to \\"upgrade\\" to 1.4.3. If I ignore the reminders, they just come back. If I downgrade to 1.4.3, Google Play then upgrades me back to 1.4.4, and the entire cycle begins again.<br /><br />Please, Amazon, catch up with Google Play and offer 1.4.4 so I can get off this treadmill!

B001JFZ118|5.0|I just ordered this for myself, and watched it last night, I was blown away by how much better the picture looked! It's a big improvement over the previous DVD release, don't  be fooled. It was like seeing it for the first time! there was hardly any grain at all, it was so clear. The version you want, is the one of Connor standing  holding a sword on a cliff, with the sky behind him. and the title Highlander is kind of a silver color. the release date next to the title is (Jan 6, 2009) definitely purchase this version, you won't be disappointed!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This DVD is taking forever to be released.<br />The show ended in December. It is now May.<br />What is taking so long?!?!
0345803485|2.0|I'll admit it, I fell for the hype. I have about 20 pages left in the book and can't bring myself to finish. It's poorly written, lacks any sort of character development, and is so repetitive i found myself skimming through parts of it. For a book that claims to be a BDSM novel, its very tame and well as Mr. Grey puts it, vanilla. Ana, have the mentality of a six year old, which shines through when her \\"inner goddess\\" is doing cartwheels in her head. Save yourself the time and money and invest in ANYTHING else besides this book.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book is intriguing, suspenseful, and I can't get enough of some characters. Excited to keep reading through the series.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|He fact is that none of the office apps for Android are that great.  I have used them all.  All of them encounter some weird errors and frustrating random self edits.  Part it is keyboard compatibility.  You have to be extra vigilant to save as well.  I have lost an hours worth of work because of it.  This program is the most useful with the least amount of frustrations.  It has an auto save of sorts.  It does a fantastic job with ppts - perfect for note taking.  Not great for excel beyond basic entry.<br />The biggest problem with this app IMHO is the sync with cloud storage.  It just doesn't a poor job of it,  but all of her programs are as bad if not worse than this one.<br /><br />Overall a good office product.  The best one of any of the Android office apps.  QuickOffice is second followed by Kingsoft.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the Hunger Games might not interest me too much because it was rated as a young adult book, but I heard the movie was wonderful. I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, to fill in the parts a movie always skirts. It was a wonderful book! I am now into the second book Catching Fire
0545265355|5.0|The best books I have ever read! I highly suggest them to EVERYONE!! I have not heard a single person dislike the books. Every person that I recommended the books to that read them loved them. Beware though. The books are so phenomenal that they have ruined all other books for me.

B002RSDW80|3.0|The parts of this movie with Streep as Julia Child are a real treat.  Wonderful!  I was inspired by Julia's personality, by the love and respect in her marriage.  I cried when she got the letter from her sister -- my husband and I are going through the same thing, and my heart ached for her.  She had a truly fascinating life.<br /><br />The parts with Julie, however.....By the end of the movie, I really despised Julie's character.  She was so self-centered, pathetically mistreating her loving and supportive husband to the point of driving him away.  She hangs out with horrible friends, wonders why she hates her friends, but never goes out and makes new friends.  I got the feeling that even the actress couldn't quite stomach her role's patheticness.  When she was interviewed in the newspaper, and received all those phone calls from publishers, I wasn't happy for her.  I was cheesed off.  She didn't deserve any of it, and I don't blame Julia Child for not endorsing her.  When she has the dinner party with her friends, and steals Julia Child's husband's toast, it enraged me.  There is no character growth.  She's the same whiny ingrate at the end of the movie as she was at the beginning.<br /><br />(Not so) shockingly, when I looked up her book on Wikipedia, I learned that after her book was published, she cheated on her husband.  And then she wrote about it.  And published another book, all about the affair!!  What the hell is wrong with this woman????  Granted, an affair (and then writing a book about it) is completely in line with her pathetic self-centered attention-seeking character, but did she learn nothing from when she drove her husband away earlier??<br /><br />I am completely conflicted.  Because the parts with Julia Child are wonderful and deserve 5 stars and I want to buy the movie to watch these parts again.  But that means having to sit through the horrible Julie parts as well!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that of the 2 books this movie is based on, I will be reading Julia Child's [[ASIN:0307475018 My Life in France (Movie Tie-In Edition)]], and avoiding Julie Powell's book like the plague.be reading Julia Child's [[ASIN:0307475018 My Life in France (Movie Tie-In Edition)]], and avoiding Julie Powell's book like the plague.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|The previews to this movie made it seem awesome...unfortunately it was boring.  I don't think it's worth paying $3.99 to watch it online but definetly for a $1.20 from Redbox if there's nothing else.
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|Without a doubt David Fincher's finest work. The visuals are almost as thrilling as the tale itself. With one exception, the cast is outstanding: Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, and the flawless Robert Downey Jr take this movie to the next level. The only real dud was Jake Gyllenhaal, who seems to have lost his flair for acting sometime after Brokeback Mountain, which is too bad because his performances as Jack Twist and Donnie Darko were great.

B0076L9W9Q|2.0|I must first start this review by stating I LOVE Halestorm. I saw them the first time in Spokane, WA at The Knitting Factory when they opened up for Theory of a Dead man. They blew TOAD out of the water and I ended up being disappointed with the headliner, TOAD, which has never happened to me.<br /><br />That being said...I feel so bad for this album. The first album was great. It had ups and downs, most of the songs were amazing, and the ones that weren't were still enjoyable.  A Familiar Taste of Poison was unbelievably beautiful and one of my favorite songs of all time. I popped this CD into my player thinking I was going to be swept away by more of Halestorm's kinky brilliance.  Instead what I got was a lot of mediocrity that came off sounding like country!  I had to look at the case to make sure we hadn't purchased the wrong CD.  After continuing to listen,I kept cringing more and more.  The amount of songs that sound like country on this CD is ridiculous.  I couldn't believe that the same band that had produced such an intense song like A Familiar Taste of Poison managed to sing \\"American Boys\\" and still be proud to sell the album.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I still adore Halestorm. I agree with Jackie Treehorn that the \\"experts\\" at the band's record label may be meddling a bit too much in what songs are released in hopes that the band gets some crossover radio support. It seems to be the only logical explanation as to why this album was released.  I can only hope that this doesn't come back to bite them in the behind.<br /><br />I really hope that they're able to release a third album after this, and that it ends up being on the same level of the first album.  I'm willing to accept a difference from album to album, but this is almost jumping genres.  If this was Halestorm's first album, I'm not sure they would have been successful enough to warrant another album.
0345803485|5.0|Magnificent and can't wait for the movies to be made based on all 3 of these books.  Very anxious to see who they will cast for the 2 most important characters.  Hopefully, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart would take on these parts.

0380789035|4.0|This is a tale of the old gods facing off against the new, evolving gods of the New World. At the center of the tale is Shadow, a man about to be released from prison, who is let out early due to the tragic death of his wife and best friend in a car accident, leaving him, literally, nothing to go home to. When he is approached by a mysterious man offering him a job, he is drawn into the conflict between the gods, with his boss trying to recruit a following to battle against the new gods. Shadow journeys across the U.S. and is haunted by the return of his dead wife, gods in various masquerades, and otherworldly situations. Shadow is an oddly sympathetic character, with more intelligence and humanity than is initially apparent. His sojourn to a small Midwestern town during the brutal winter is a tale within itself as he is drawn into this apparently idyllic setting that has a dark undertone just below the surface. I wanted to know more about Shadow and his background as I found the character to be intriguing. While I liked the novel, I felt it was missing something that would have made it a spectacular, epic tale.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is clearly born to be one of the best of its genre in our time. I fully immersed myself into the author's beautifully crafted and easy to understand characters and scenarios. I felt from the beginning I wanted the book to never end, and having finished it immediately went online to know more about the author. One thing for certain is that should this go to a movie format when all the parts are knitted together (\\"Wool\\"-get it?) the claustrophobic atmosphere and rich, well-developed characters will be amazing to watch, indeed. A must read for anyone who has an imagination and wants to be fully entertained.
B005EM8O8O|4.0|I liked this book for three reasons:<br />1. It was a real page turner. I definitely wanted to know what was going to happen next. And the ending was quite satisfying.<br />2. The characters were true to their personalities.. This was important as the story went along and eventually resolved itself.<br />3. This story has a \\"singularity moment.\\" Without giving too much away from the story, part of it deals with artificial intelligence. I'm fascinated with this topic, and I found its treatment in this story to be very entertaining.<br /><br />Part of this story relies on a backstory, but this is one area where I do believe the author missed an opportunity. The book wasn't particularly long. And it would've been great to deal with the backstory as more of a parallel story since it could have itself been very suspenseful and entertaining to switch between the present and the past. In any case, I really enjoyed this book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoy the problem solving aspect of this game, it forces you to think and solve the problem before you begin.  Especally if you want a high score.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|This app is rather persistent. Once installed, it refuses to not be running. On the other hand, it constantly contradicts itself as it tends to crash 4-5 times a day in the background. In addition, it comes with a rather violent and confusing collection of stories, which oddly enough - just like the app - keeps contradicting itself.<br />Other than that, decent app I suppose.
B001GWK2MC|4.0|My girls are 4 and 16 months and they love this bouncer.  It is a good size for indoor or outdoors and it appears to be very durable so far.  They love the fact that it looks like a castle also.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I have listened to Norah Jones since the beginning.  I love her voice so I have liked all that she has released with my favorites being 'Come Away With Me' and 'The Fall.'  What I like about 'Little Broken Hearts' is that it uses the tracks that Norah recorded for the 'Rome' album from last year and use them as the starting point for a new approach that doesnt lose Norah in the mix.  Repeated listenings are rewarded with this release.  Overall a nice change, not as dreamlike or sad as something like Lana Del Rey or as romantic as Melody Gardot but enjoyable just the same.  Target has the exclusive version with a 3 track bonus disc. The inside of the digipak has a booklet which folds out into a mini poster of Norah. It is the same image from the album cover minus the album title and song listing.
1613822863|5.0|Sometimes I read a book after seeing the movie.  And, often the book's plot is heightened or better flavored - maybe because I hear the voices of the better actors who brilliantly perform roles of masterpieces.<br /><br />This is one of those books where I saw many versions of the book prior to reading.  And, even spoofs of the book - whether it be Mel Brooks or Abbott and Costello - touched upon main themes which made me believe the previously seen movies followed the core concept of the literature.<br /><br />I was surprised.<br /><br />This book is a clever yarn by a brother who ventures to see and gets stuck in the polar ices and witnesses two men - one chasing the other -  in the blinding white.  The big one gets free, and the small one climbs on board of the brother's boat - and then delivers his tale for the next 40-60 pages.  That tale is then woven with monster's tale of what happened to him when he escaped his creator's lab.<br /><br />Frankenstein speaks?  Yes.  Any good?  Many languages.  How educated a level?  With great use of the vocabulary, no less.<br /><br />And, Frankenstein is not a nemesis to the villagers, who chase him with fire and so forth.  No, he is the nemesis to the creator - who returns with his tale after the closure of the monster's account of growing in the mind: learning behavior, learning language and more.<br /><br />Ultimately, the monster demands that his creator make a mate or else.  The \\"or else\\" makes the monster more a Dr. Jekyll than an innocent lout who walks about with large shoes, and responds in primitive fashion to other's actions.  Oh no - this monster is devious, plotting, and controlling - intentionally killing innocent people affiliated with the creator  to implore upon his  creator of his seriousness in demanding that Dr. Frankenstein make him a mate.<br /><br />Wow.  What a book. What a tale.  And, oh so different than any of the movies - but I still have to admit that [[ASIN:B001DDBD0O Young Frankenstein ]] is another masterpiece - just another genre.nother masterpiece - just another genre.

B001RPIYV4|4.0|This treatment of R n J is actually set in a modern city (I think Vera Cruz) and while the script is faithful to the original Shakespearean language, the settings and props are all current.  The opening prologue is read by a newscaster and the initial fray takes place at a gas station.  The opening uses cinematography usually seen on music videos and can be jarring.  Five minutes into this Romeo and Juliet, I got the feeling that unless the camera work and the soundtrack changed in a major way, I might not be able to continue watching.  I stuck with it, however, and was impressed on a couple levels:  first how the original story translates so easily to modern sensibilities, and secondly how DiCaprio and Danes were able to speak to an audience of cynical 9th graders.<br />An explanation is in order.  Teaching Romeo and Juliet to high school freshmen can be daunting, but by juxtposing this version with other treatments for certain parts of the play (the initial fight, the ball, the balcony scene...) students were able to catch the feel of how the story can be told in numerous ways.<br />The end result was that the students preferred the DiCaprio version (as it came to be known) and even though the language was faithful to the original they stuck with it.  Using the closed captioning helped here.<br />The end result is that this is an enjoyable treatment and since the story is so well known, it's fun dealing with the sometimes jarring physical treatment.

B005VA8AZQ|5.0|I love good scary movies. These days 'horror' seems to translate into gore. So far I have purchased the first 2 episodes of the series and I love it. Very creepy characters and some good jumping moments. I wish there were more shows/movies like this. The cast does an incredible job. I hope this series is around for a long time. If anyone reads this review and can suggest some good scary shows/movies please leave a comment here. Thanks.

006197806X|5.0|FIRST OF ALL!!!  If you haven't read Delirium you must go and read it right now!  It is defiantly one of the best books I have ever read in my life.  And this book is not far from it.  I received this book from NCTE from Harper! Thank you so much.  I could not wait to read this book.  For the last couple weeks I have been told that I have to read it.  That it is amazing!  And boy is it ever.<br /><br />The book starts where the first book finishes. The chapters are split in Now and Then. You are learning about Lena's experiences on finding herself. She is trying to figure out who she is because Lena is not the normal Lena anymore.  She is different because she has to be.  She is in the Wilds and she is trying to survive.  She is learning to do things that she has never done before to pull her weight with the Wilds.  I really like that Lauren incorporated this into the story.  It showed her struggle with what she had to do.  It showed that she was having a hard time dealing with the death of Alex.<br /><br />But during this you find out about Julian.  Julian is a very important.  He is about to be cured and he is doing it because this is what his family wants.  But there are some hold ups because Julian and Lena are kidnapped and held hostage.  They are going to do anything to get out and escape to the Wilds.  Oh but have no fear....there are twist and turns!  Boy are there twist and turns!<br /><br />This is my favorite book of the series so far!  I know that we still have book three so I need to wait unit that book comes out to make my decision, but this is defiantly up there for book of the series!  Maybe book of the year....but ask me again in December...:)

0061726834|5.0|So about 6 months ago a good friend of mine, Lynn at Bringing the Epic, told me about this \\"great book that I had to read!\\"  Well I would always tell her that if I had the time I would read it. I would tell her I just had so much to read at this time so I don't know.  Every time I would be at the library or at the store I would look at it and pick it up and walk around.  Then at one point in time, I would put it back and leave.  Well for Christmas this year, my wonderful husband bought me a Kindle!  It was the best gift ever!  So now I decided to give Delirium a chance and borrowed from my library through my Kindle. I think this is one of the best things ever invented.  But with this I was able to read one of the best books ever!<br /><br />When I first started this book, it took me awhile to really get into it.  After about 60 pages I could not put it down.  This was defiantly one of the best books of the year!  I could not get enough of it.  And I am so happy that Harper Collins gave me Pandemonium to read!  I can not wait to dig into that!<br /><br />You meet Lena. Lena lives in a world that doesn't believe in love.  They believe that love is a disease.  That love causes many problems.  So they come up with a cure to help prevent love from happening.  My favorite part about the whole book is that they use the feelings you get when you first fall in love with someone as the symptoms of the disease.  I literally thought that that was ingenious.  I mean come on, how great is that.<br />  Lena is your typical high school girl.  She has a best friend that she does everything with.  She is nervous about her procedure that is going to cure her from ever feeling love.  But in the mist of all of this, she meets Alex.  Alex is trying to be a friend.  He is just looking for someone to talk to.  He meets Lena and they become friends.  But Lena thinks that there is something about Alex that doesn't meet the eye.  But Alex is cured.  So he can't have feelings for Lena can he?<br /><br />This book is written beautifully.  It really has this flow to it.  It is defiantly a page turner.  The whole story just keeps you going and wanting more.  I need my Alex!!!  I have to find my Alex!  Lauren Oliver, you are one great writer.  I love everything about your story!  Thank you for one great experience!!! You are the best! This was truly one fantastically brilliant story!br /><br />This book is written beautifully.  It really has this flow to it.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What a ridiculous year for movies 2012 has already been and we still have eight months of it left to look forward to. Just look at some of this year's big releases: a new Pixar film with a female lead, Christopher Nolan's final trip to Gotham City, Ridley Scott's return to the sci-fi genre, Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth, and reboots of our friendly neighborhood web slinger and one of the better Philip K. Dick adaptations. And that's just scratching the surface.<br /><br />Marvel has had something up their sleeve for quite some time though. A gargantuan superhero project they've been teasing since 2008 in five different movies that fan boys and comic book geeks have been foaming at the mouth for featuring one of the most star-studded casts the likes of any movie has ever seen before. That's right, boys and girls; The Avengers is finally upon us.<br /><br />I was riding high on everything Joss Whedon since I'm still feeling the after-effects of the jaw-dropping greatness that is The Cabin in the Woods. However, I refused to get excited for The Avengers. I had doubts that mostly resided in every character getting the appropriate amount of screen time. That and every ounce of anticipation in my body is currently invested in both Prometheus and The Dark Knight Rises. The Avengers wasted little time taking full advantage of that.<br /><br />The movie is explosive right from the very first scene and throughout its entirety. The special effects are incredible. With its rather massive budget ($220 million, a number they nearly made back in international ticket sales alone before it even had the chance to hit the states), it's fantastic to see that they've spared no expense making The Avengers look and sound absolutely phenomenal. The technology used in the film is insane, as well. The tesseract and everything otherworldly will probably be the first thing that comes to mind, but SHIELD has some really amazing devices as does Tony Stark. All of it is just dripping with style.<br /><br />You couldn't ask for better performances from the cast. The Avengers thrives on these clashing personalities and you can't help but get sucked into it. Much of the action is these well-known superheroes fighting amongst themselves and beating the snot out of each other in the process. These are some of the best scenes in the movie, especially when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) first shows up. It's only topped by when Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) first turns into The Hulk.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Hulk fan, although I did enjoy The Incredible Hulk from 2008. I can say with confidence that he has never been this glorious. He is arguably the highlight of The Avengers. He does some pretty innovative things with the destruction he leaves behind and one scene in particular that he shares with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) will leave you with the urge to stand up and cheer.<br /><br />Everybody is going to be drawn to somebody different in the action packed extravaganza. Aside from The Hulk, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is freaking great. He steals nearly every scene he's a part of by basically just being himself and everything that comes out of his mouth is hilarious. Joss Whedon is able to squeeze in these little bits of humor when you're least expecting it that helps makes things endlessly entertaining at all times. Like the guy playing Galaga, Captain America trying to convince two cops to give him a perimeter, or Thor mentioning Loki was adopted. Tom Hiddleston continues to be impressive, as well. I thought he did a fine job in Thor, but upped his game in The Deep Blue Sea. His return to the Loki character is almost majestic in this evil super villain sense. Loki is downright ferocious at times. His scene with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is magnificently menacing.<br /><br />It is downright ridiculous that a superhero movie is not only this good, but is pretty much already in the books. The summer movie season has officially started and it feels like nothing will ever be able to measure up to this. That means that this year is going to be downright marvelous for movies or studios are going to pull the trigger a little too early. The truth is that you can't scream enough praise for this movie. Its two hours and twenty minute runtime goes by in the blink of an eye, its cast is astounding, its special effects are beautiful, and there are a few really dynamic camera angles thrown in for good measure. The Avengers is easily the best and most action packed movie in Marvel's arsenal.<br /><br />Be sure you stay through the credits; ALL the way through the credits. There are a few surprises to enjoy hidden in there. Earth's mightiest heroes have been given the exceptional treatment they truly deserve that will demand repeat viewings. All that's really left to be said is that The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man certainly have their work cut out for them.othing will ever be able to measure up to this.

159514188X|4.0|When I got this book I was so excited to dive right into it.  I asked many people what they thought of the book and every person said the book was amazing.  And I agree.  From beginning to end this book was amazing!  You really feel for Clay.  You want what he is going through to end.  But you know that it won't end until he finishes the tapes.<br /><br />I think that every student in high school should have to read this book. It would open their eyes to a world that some never want to talk about but should talk about.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This is a book like I've never read before. It just is weird and real at the same time. It's amusing and scary at the same time. And all in a perfect balance for me to like the story.<br /><br />But I have to say, when I first downloaded the sample I didn't like it at all. I just couldn't get into the story but once you're in, you're really in!<br />The ending was also not my cup of tea. Because it didn't really end: they left in search of something and that was it. It can only be an end of a serie: there must be another book following this one. And it is, the author is writing #2 right at this moment. Great, because I really want to know about what happens to the peculiar children!
0312641893|4.0|I heard some really great things about this book that I knew when it came out I had to get my hands on it.  When I was at NCTE I was excited that they had it there!!!  I had to read it, and I am glad that I did.  You meet Cinder and she is a mechanic in New Beijing.  She is the best mechanic for miles, and everyone knows it. But see Cinder is in a high demand because she lives in a time where there are humans, cyborgs, and androids.  One day the Prince comes to her with his assistant, who is an android, who needs to be fixed.  This is where it all begins!  During the whole story you know that something is up between them two, but you just do not know what.  And the end....I did not see that end coming.  Maybe I was just not watching out for it, but I was such a surprise.<br /><br />Cinder is a retelling of Cinderella.  Cinder has a stepmother that hates her, stepsisters that just want to make their mother happy, and a Prince that wants her and she doesn't know why.  I mean he is the Prince!  He could have anyone, but her wants her.  The main thing that is holding her back is that she is not human....and the Prince is.  That could be hard for anyone.  Even in this day and age it is hard to accept change.  This is change in their world.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is when Cinder goes to the party.  The writing in this scene was amazing.  Marissa Meyer did a great job describing what was going on.  Marissa Meyer is brilliant! She did such an amazing job.  This book was one of the best books that I have read this year!

1594744769|4.0|This book was a very good book.  It was very different then anything that I have read in a really long time.  It really shows that everything is not what it seems.  The cover of the book is very creepy yet pretty.  I love the antique feel it has.<br /><br />Okay so on with the book.  When I first started to read the book I thought about not reading it because I didn't know exactly what was going to happen and that kind of scared me.  But I am so glad that I decided to stick with it.  Jacob is a 16 year old boy who just recently lost one of his best friends....his grandfather.  So in honor of his grandfather, and to cope with his death, Jacob and his father go to an island off the coast of Whales where his grandfather spent some time at.  There he decides that he is going to travel to a house.  See this house took place in a lot of stories that his grandfather told him as a child.  He always that they were fake stories but he is in for a rude awakening.  There Jacob lives a story that his grandfather lived many years before.  Jacob has to decide if he is going to live in this time or in the past.....<br /><br />I really liked the book a lot.  It was a very strange yet amazing book all tied into one.  The pictures really give this book something.  I am not totally for sure what it gives it but I can tell you this...the pictures make the book about 100 times better.  I loved how every picture tied into the story and tied in with the characters.  I think that it really helped the story.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This close look at the so-called \\"quiet Beatle\\" is a well made documentary. Watching this made me feel sad about George's passing all over again.

I want \\"Volume 2\\" already!!
0439023521|5.0|I instantly fell in love with Katniss.  She is strong willed but yet deep down is very unsure of herself and her surroundings.  She has so much love for her sister that she would do anything for her including sacrifice her life in the Hunger Games so that her sister doesn't have to go.  When that happened in the book I couldn't believe it.  No one would do that for their family during this time.  I mean that is practically committing  suicide.  The game is that 24 go into the area and only 1 comes out.  Not the best odds in the world....not even the best odds period!<br /><br />Katniss was sent to the Capital, along with Peeta; the boy tribute from District 12, to get ready for the Hunger Games.  They need to attract sponsors and make the people love them.  During this time you find out that there is more than meets the eye with Peeta and Katniss.  Peeta loves Katniss and she doesn't know it.  How amazing is that!  A love story in the mist of death.  This is why I love dystopians so much.  Some love the swoon that other books bring to the table, but these books do the same thing but just with something a little extra!<br /><br />After some kissing and major twist at the end of the book it really sucks you in.  You just can't get enough of the Hunger Games.  You want more, and you will get it.  :)<br /><br />The whole book and story between Katniss and Peeta was amazing!  You truly fell in love with both characters.  And you seriously fall madly in love with their heroism.  You wanted them to survive for each other.  You wanted both of them to make it. You want them to be together.  I can not wait to read Catching Fire.  I have to know what happens next.  Do they stay together? Do they make it work?  DON'T TELL ME!!!  I will read it.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|this book is not for literary snobs. it is about violent people living in a violent time and place. gritty. brutal. Awesome. engaging charachters. entertainingly witty dialogue. well written. highly recommend as i am chomping at the bit to read the next one. immediately.
0545123275|4.0|So I am not going to lie....it took me forever to get through this book.  Last week I had family in town, so not much reading was done.  And this week so far has been really crazy with work.  But I came home today and sat on my balcony and read until the bugs weren't hungry anymore and I was finished with the book.<br /><br />The book started off so well.  I wanted Sam to tell Grace that he loved her right off the bat  ( that didn't happen),  I didn't want them to  run into any trouble (that didn't happen), and I wanted everything to work our between them (that sorta happens).  About half way through the book I was really wanting some action.  I felt the book lacked that but was great everywhere else.  And then the end hit! Oh my God the end.  I did not see that coming at all.  Everything from Jack kidnapping Grace to Sam changing for good in front of Grace. I didn't know how to accept what was going on.  I cried when Jack died. And I automatically assumed that if Jack died Sam for sure was gone.  Then Grace sees him!  AND HE IS HUMAN.<br /><br />I really want to pick of Linger and read it to see what happens between Grace and Sam, but it will have to wait...hopefully not long :)
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Lets just say my grandson watched this movie 4 times the day that I rented it. I can at least say I got my money's worth.
014241543X|5.0|When I first saw this book I had heard many good things about it.  But I never imagined that it would that good.  From the first page to the last you really do not know what to expect but all you can think is \\"Oh My God, I hope she pulls through.\\"<br /><br />You meet Mia and her family in the first couple pages and you really are in love with the family.  The tragedy strikes and the story is about her journey trying to deal with the situation that she is given. You meet some more family and mostly friends.  Their words and wisdom help Mia make really tough decisions that a normal 17 year old should not be making. I have never cried so much over one book in my life.  I am so glad that I listened to all the people that told me to read this book.<br /><br />I really can't wait to pick up the second book to find out what happens to Mia during this time in her life.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This movie gave a good peak into monastic life. They did a good job in<br />educating the viewer without the viewer realizing it. This is a good movie.
0439023491|5.0|First and for most I have to tell you that the synopsis does not do justice for this book.  When I first read the synopsis I could not figure out why everyone was ranting and raving about these books.  One of my friends would ask me every time I saw her if I read them yet.  I would tell her no not yet but I will very soon.  I am so sad that I waited so long!!!<br /><br />Katniss is back and she is living at Victor's Village with her family and Peeta.  She doesn't know what to do because she is supposed to be madly in love with Peeta but Gale is showing feelings toward her.  I don't know about her, but I would jump on Gale like no other.  I mean this is the guy who has been there for everything!  They are best friends!  UGH!  Any way she has to go back on tour for the Hunger Games and she really just wants it to be done and over.  President Snow makes a surprise visit to her to tell her that she will be with Peeta and not with Gale.  He tells her that she will marry Peeta!  What do you do now....she has to portray this image that she is madly in love with Peeta.  Which she is in love with Peeta but there is Gale.....  What to do, what to do..<br /><br />Well it is the year of the 75th Hunger Games and that means that it is not just any other Hunger games, it is Quarter Quell.  Every 25 years it is a special Hunger Games.  There is basically no rules if you really think about.  And this year to the Capitol is special.  This year is going to the game of games.  This year all the previous victors are going back to the area.  I personally could not believe it.  I never saw this coming.  This is what I thought was going to happen in Catching Fire:<br /><br />Katniss was going to go back to District Twelve and she was going to live in Victor's Village with Peeta.  About a year down the line she was going to make it perfectly clear to Peeta that she loves Gale and she wants to be with him.  The Capitol was not going to like it, but they don't own her anymore so what could they do.  She was going to have a decent life in District Twelve with Gale.  They were then going to have kids, and when there kids were old enough they were going to have to go into the arena.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.  This book had so many twist and turns it was unbelievable.  I could not put it down.  It had everything you would want in a book and more!  Thank you Suzanne Collins for one amazing read!  YOU ARE THE BEST!  Now on to book 3!hey do.  She was going to have a decent life in District Twelve with Gale.  They were then going to have kids, and when there kids were old enough they were going to have to go into the arena.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I love this story. Abby is a college student making her way with just her best friend America and street smarts. When she meets Travis she's warned to stay clear of him. He's your average college hunk making his way through the ladies. The harder Abby tries to stary clear of Travis, the champion of the campus fight circle, the more determined Travis is to make Abby his. I love the nick name he uses for her. The up and downs they go through trying to make things work is painful but so worth it in the end. The characters are absolutely loveable and believable. Bravo Jamie McGuire.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I came here to Amazon to see when the Bluray will be released.  I have had a PS3 for two years and have only purchased one Bluray (The fantastic How to Train Your Dragon).  John Carter will be my next bluray purchase.<br /><br />After I saw the release date was June 5th, I noticed that this movie was getting nearly five stars with 212 reviews.  How is it possible?  This movie was eviscerated by almost every movie critic.  I should know, I spent the evening I enjoyed the movie having my heart ripped out by hateful youtube reviewers.  I agree that most of the criticisms of the movie are valid, but the whole was so much better than a few weak parts.  How is it possible that a movie I loved so much be attacked so visciously?  I accepted that I must be weird and love a movie no one else does.<br /><br />Last weekend I spent with my wife's family.  We were discussing movies.  Sheepishly I said how much I had enjoyed John Cater.  None of them had seen it, but they said that everyone they have talked to, who did see it, loved it.  Huh, maybe I'm not alone.  Now I see I have 212 and counting friends who are just like me and love this flawed, but precious jewel of a movie.  I feel I am in good company.<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe, if enough of us buy the bluray/dvd it may convince one daring Disney executive to green light the producers, give them a more modest budget, fine tune an exciting story, and make a sequal.  I know its just a pipe dream, but I will hold out hope that I can be transported again to Barsoom and go on more adventures with John Carter of Mars.
0671449028|4.0|My little one loves this book. It has a lot of the Sandra Boynton features that children like - bright colors, lots of animals and rhyming text. It's great for the night-time bed routine because the animals in the story do the things that kids need to do for bedtime (mostly). I don't love it quite as much as my daughter does. My issue is with one thing: the animals exercise. They exercise (running, lifting weights, jump rope, etc) as part of the bedtime routine, after they put their pajamas on. Exercising as part of the bedtime routine is not something I want to encourage. So far, my daughter hasn't been influenced by this but I think that I would not have bought this book if I had known it had such a strange bedtime routine. Maybe it works for others but I prefer to encourage the exercise portion during the day!

B0006B2A42|5.0|I'm not going to repeat the positive accolades afforded this \\"classic\\" Cold War thriller by other reviews.I only wish to give a litle informed background info on the submarine. The fictional \\"USS Tigerfish\\"(SSN 509),is a Skate class SSN. This class represented the U.S. Navy's first production nuclear fast attack sub based on the USS Nautilus,(SSN 571) prototype still using a  more traditional (and imho),a very beautiful hull form designed and based on the highly advanced German Type XXI U-Boat. This class included USS Skate (SSN 578),USS Swordfish (SSN 579),USS Sargo (SSN 583) and USS Seadragon (SSN 584).<br /><br />USS Skate (SSN-578), the third submarine in the US Navy to be named for the skate, a type of ray, was the lead ship of the Skate class of nuclear submarines. She was the third nuclear submarine commissioned, the first to make a completely submerged trans-Atlantic crossing and the second submarine to transit the North Pole and the first to surface there.<br />The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics on 18 July 1955, and her keel was laid in Groton, Connecticut on 21 July 1955. She was launched on 16 May 1957 This class was heavily involved in the U.S. Navy's early Arctic under-ice explorations and efforts in the late 50's and into the 60's.All were excellent sea-boats and were on active duty,serving for for several decades.The Skate,known effectionately as the \\"Arctic Warrior\\",served from 1957 until her decommissioning in 1986..almost 30 yrs!<br /><br />NOTE: all of the surface \\"live action\\" sub scenes are NOT of a Skate class SSN. They are of the diesel/electric sub the USS Ronquil, which was a converted (late GUPPY IIA) WWII fleetboat of the Balao class. While the bow is shaped similarly to the Skate class (in the conversion), close observation reveals no vertical tail fin at the stern which would be visible in the surface scenes and the bow planes on the Skate retract in to the hull when not used. The special effects model does (of course) have the vertical tail fin visible in the scene when they arrive at the ice barrier.
0439023521|4.0|Imagine if the TV show \\"Survivor\\" featured kids instead of adults, and rather than voting each other off the island, the competitors had to hunt down and kill one another. Amid the bloodshed, two of the teenage participants seem to fall in love.  Would that be compelling television, or what?<br /><br />This, roughly, is the premise of \\"The Hunger Games\\" the Suzanne Collins novel that has proved wildly popular among teens and tweens.<br /><br />As a 51-year-old dad, I realize I'm not in the target market for this book. But my daughter, 11, devoured the book, and with all the buzz about it, I figured I should check it out myself.<br /><br />Mostly, I liked what I found. Collins has created an intriguing, if grim, futuristic world where a rich and powerful central government dominates the populace (hmmm, a political message here?), keeping most people impoverished and scrapping to survive.<br /><br />The story centers on the annual Hunger Games in which children from age 12 to 18 are randomly picked from throughout the country of Panem to fight to the death.  The weeks-long, 24-hour TV event transfixes the nation, with each \\"district\\" cheering for their representatives and the well-off residents of The Capital betting on who will be the final survivor.<br /><br />Our hero is Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl who is sent to represent \\"District 12\\" in the Hunger Games. It's nice to see a tween book with a female character who is as strong and smart as Katniss turns out to be. In this sort of book, it's natural to play along with action, wondering what move you'd make next in the battle for survival, so it's good to have a protagonist who is clever and (mostly) avoids doing dumb things.<br /><br />Collins sprinkles the story high-tech twists and imaginative elements like \\"tracker jackers,\\" genetically altered wasps that attack and torment the games participants.<br /><br />As the story goes on, a love story develops between Katniss and fellow competitor Peeta. To me, this was the weakest element of the book, simply because it's fairly familiar and less inventive than the other parts.<br /><br />I also was not thrilled with the ending, which basically leaves you hanging and waiting for the next book. Even when they are part of a series, I like books to have a solid ending.
B006JSXYPA|1.0|This is a disappointing film.  The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects.  This one didn't really bother.  Mind numbing, and in a bad way.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|just like I remember from when I was a kid but only much much better!  good graphics and very addictive!  now my kids will learn to love it like I did.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|After hearing all the bad reviews of this movie, I decided to wait for the DVD. I loved the original but was curious about the remake. So, one night, my boyfirend, son (age 13) and I sat down for a \\"movie night\\". We all got so engrossed in this movie! It was amazing for all three of us to LIKE the same movie! I am definitely adding this to my DVD collection! LOVED IT!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The author pulls you in to the story in the first chapter and holds your attention for adventure, intrigue and self preservation to the end.  Well written and looking forward to the next book in this saga.
0307949508|5.0|Books 2 and 3 of the Millennium trilogy are essentially one story, as many others have said here, and together, the two books make for amazing reading. After Book 1, the electrifying [[ASIN:0307949486 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Movie Tie-in Edition): Book 1 of the Millennium Trilogy (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]], I wasn't sure what direction the books would go.  In short, I was pleasantly surprised.  Fire and Hornets nest are leagues better than Dragon Tattoo, and Fire is by far the strongest in the series.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I am a Kiera Knightly fan.  I did not care for this movie at all. It took me 3 times to watch the entire movie.  Watch the BBC version instead.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When the hype of hunger games came about I wasn't interested one bit... But then one night when I was watching tv in a hotel room just a few days before my wedding - while my husband was enjoying his bachelor party, I found myself looking at e-books on amazon ... Hunger games popped up as a book I might like, so I but the bullet and purchased for $5...<br /><br />Best purchase ever.!!!! This book was actually more than a teeny bopper sensation that I thought it was going to be. The story behind it is more than just a live story but it had an underlying of social issues and I found it to be very interesting.<br /><br />Anyway I'm no English major here, I just love to read books that aren't a waste of my time. I was defiantly impressed. I've recommended this book to everyone I know!!! So go, BUY IT!!!! ( and while your at it just buy all 3 books!!)<br />Ajot
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Качать!!! Игра красивая, затягивает. Очень понравилась. Не пожалел, что два доллара заплатил.Много уровней.Рад, что появляются такие игры.Не знаю, что еще написать.

038533348X|5.0|Vonnegut was one of the literary voices of my generation, even though the seminal events in his life occurred as part of my father's generation.<br /><br />I love this book!  I've read it many times and often think about Bokononism when the world seems too bizarre.  There are so many positive reviews on this book that I have little to add other than a bit of advice:  Read the book out in the open on a warm night.  If you have access to calypso music, turn it down very low and have a jar of dark rum nearby.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I had an AT lapel mic for mic duties and decided to get a Gamecom 367 headset.Plugged her in and the sound was quite decent.Plugged in the mic and nothing.Dead as a dodo.Tried different mic inputs,Switched the mic mute back and forth.Not a murmur from the microphone.Bloody angry.<br /><br />P.S. well it appears the mic is OK but it just has a very low gain.Only use this with an onboard soundcard which has the Mic boost feature like the realtek soundboard I have on my motherboard(update your realtek drivers to get this function).Mine is set at +20 db and now the mic works.<br /><br />I had it plugged into a mixing desk but the input gain was too low and it created alot of noise.<br /><br />I amended my score from 1 to 3.
B003XRELEI|1.0|I think I've read most everything Vonnegut published. Some 3 or 4 times. This was my second reading of B of C because the first time caused me to exit the doors of Vonnegut's theatre with a headache and a very bad taste in my mouth. It was only later that I recovered.<br /><br />Every writer has highs and lows. This is Vonnegut's nadir. As he stated \\"This book is my fiftieth-birthday present to myself. I feel as though I am crossing the spine of a roof--having ascended one slope.I am programmed at fifty to perform childishly--to insult \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />Basically, cosmic trash and, unfortunately, an enduringly popular part of his legacy.<br /><br />Vonnegut has always had the ability to bring me into his world as a participant. B of C drags the reader almost unwillingly into the mental carnage of piteous self-assessment. But, like the pearls before swine, there are more than a few moments of good writing. My favorite:<br /><br />\\"Listen: The waitress brought me another drink. She wanted to light my hurricane lamp again. I wouldn't let her. \\"Can you see anything in the dark, with your sunglasses on?\\" she asked me.<br />\\"The big show is inside my head,\\" I said.<br /><br />Read it at your peril. You've been sufficiently notified.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I bought this CD after I saw the Katy Perry video for \\"Part of Me.\\"  I'm a former Marine, so I wanted to support Katy.  It turns out that the CD is great.  It's got about five great tracks on it.  Some of the songs have some profanity in them that doesn't add to the music.  I guess you get that with kids playing with the First Amendment.  Otherwise, it's great.

0240815807|5.0|This book is pretty AWESOME! Not only is it very informative but it is a FUN read.  I'm not a huge fan of books, but this one was very informative and entertaining.  I've read other mixing books before that have made me feel out of the loop because I didn't have the types of equipment they talked about.  The author explains things in this book in a way that any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) user can apply the techniques to their projects.<br /><br />Each chapter has \\"Cut to the chase\\" which is great to reference back to for quick tips, and also has \\"Assignments\\".  These are awesome because it is straight to the point on what you should apply to your track.  It guides into the right approach to mixing in a proper way.<br /><br />So will this book really help?  Well, I mixed a song 2 weeks prior to reading this book- and I thought it turned out \\"O.K.\\".  After reading through this book, I went through the steps and mixed a new song.  Not only did I notice a different in the sound quality, but so did fellow listeners on line.  Although I am NO WHERE near becoming a pro at mixing.  I can say, that since reading this book and following the guidelines, I am headed in the right direction to creating Commercial sounding music out of my home studio (AKA my laptop).<br /><br />Definitely RECOMMENDED to other producers and engineers!!!<br /><br />-DJ Unprotected

B007V9YF5E|2.0|Once again we must ask how a cast as fine as the one assembled for this mess of a movie signed on to be associated with it.  Surely there must be a reason because if they had read the script (which could have been more than two or three pages of lines in length!) they would have seen that there is no plot to speak of - just a series of poorly executed incidents, each they response to a newly identified character whose background is so ignored that we are left without a clue as to how the characters are interrelated. Lem Dobbs is credited as `writer' and the big surprise is that this is a product of Steven Soderbergh's direction.<br /><br />The plot is summarized as follows: `Beautiful freelance covert operative Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is hired out by her handler to various global entities to perform jobs which governments can't authorize and heads of state would rather not know about. After a mission to rescue a hostage in Barcelona, Mallory is quickly dispatched on another mission to Dublin. When the operation goes awry and Mallory finds she has been double crossed, she needs to use all of her skills, tricks and abilities to escape an international manhunt, make it back to the United States, protect her family, and exact revenge on those that have betrayed her.'<br /><br />The supporting cast, most of the characters are so ambiguous that we forget their names, is carried out by such fine actors as Michael Angarano, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, Maximino Arciniega, and some other very talented but misused actors.  Even the special effects are poorly executed.  Apparently this film was created to feature the MMA (that's Mixed Martial Arts for those who don't follow sports) champion Gina Cardona. An actress she is not.  Pass.  Grady Harp, May 12

0385534639|5.0|Do you ever wish you could escape into a book's world, entranced by the author's descriptions?  This book is not only a beautifully written story but feels like a masterpiece hung in a museum that you have just walked into.  The book delves into the complex game between two master illusionists and their prodigies, who play the game while simultaneously falling in love.  The scene is a circus, but not the type of circus you may think of with animals and clowns.  Under the cover of the night, Celia and Marco create tents of wonder; and as their relationship grows into love, the tents become more impossible to comprehend in their beauty.  The ending is unexpected, but satisfying.  The prose Ms. Morgenstern uses to describe the visuals is entrancing, and I can't wait for her next offering.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this story.  At first, I didn't want to read a book that was targeted for the young adults out there, but was genuinely surprised at the creativity.  I felt the author did a good job in letting me get to the know the characters and found myself wanting to find out what was going to happen next.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Like others have mentioned, the writing is this book was really awful. The sex was interesting enough to keep me reading, but because the writing was so poor I had no desire to read book 2 or 3. For all the women who are going crazy for this series, there are better erotic novels out there. Let's not reward high school prose and an overall lack of editing.

B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is the second game I've purchased from Alawar Entertainment Inc. I actually searched for more of the games made by this company after I played one  their other hidden object games.  Their approach to what's hidden is different then most. You search for pieces of objects to make it whole then place it where it belongs to solve the mystery in the episode. It's challenging but has hints in case you get stuck. The graphics are really wonderful in this game too.  I'll play it more then once. definitely worth 99 cents
0618918248|2.0|Richard Dawkins is perhaps one of the most prolific writers of about science in our time. Unfortunately, his writing and dialogue is distinctly flavored by anti-Christian rhetoric that makes his stance, his scientific reasoning questionable.<br />It isn't that he doesn't provide plenty of scientific information; it's that his passion to attack Christians and others who may believe in things that contradict his beliefs is a step beyond rational. He says that God is separate from science and that those who believe in science and religion cannot be objective in how they view things like Darwin, the survival of the fittest, natural selection, etc.<br />So if Dawkins has the answers, if his reasoning is more plausible, why not let them stand on their own? Why the appeal to ignoring God, or attempting to dissuade people from believing in a creator or personal God?<br />In a sense, he becomes the opposite of what he appeals to. He wants people to become rational beings, depending only on material, mathematical reality. Yet, anyone would be hard pressed to describe Richard Dawkins as completely dispassionate and objective when it comes to belief in God, evolution, Charles Darwin or God.<br />There are many examples of this. One is an interview that he did with Ben Stein for the movie \\"Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed,\\" released in 2008, where Stein asks Dawkins about his negative remarks about the God of the Bible.<br />So Dawkins reads his God slam from his book, \\"The God Delusion\\":<br />\\"The God of the old testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction. Jealous and proud of it. A petty, unjust, unforgiving control freak. A vindictive unjust ethnic cleaner. A misogynistic, homophobic, racist infanticidal, genocidal philocidal pestilencial, malagonical, sadomasochistic, capriciosly malevolent bully.\\"<br />Stein, half in jest and half seriously, asks why Dawkins is so bent on characterizing the God of the Bible in a negative light:<br />Stein: So that'swhat you think of God?\\"<br />Dawkins: Yes.<br />Stein: How about if people believe in a God of infinite lovingness and kindness and forgiveness and generosity, sort of like the modern day God? Why spoil it for them? Why not just let them have their fun and enjoy it?<br />What Stein is asking again is, why all the effort to diminish people's belief in God?<br />\\"I believe it is a liberating thing to free yourself from primitive superstition,\\" he responds. \\"I think a lot of people, when they give up God feel a great sense of release and freedom.\\"<br />Stein then asks Dawkins how the heavens and the earth came to be.<br /><br />Dawkins: By a very slow process. Nobody knows how it started. We know the kind of event it must have been; we know the sort of event that must have been to happen for the origin of life.<br />Stein: And what was that?<br />Dawkins: It was the origin of the first self-replicating molecule.<br />Stein: Right and how did that happen?<br />Dawkins: I've told you, I don't know.<br />Stein: So you have no idea how it started.<br />Dawkins: No. Nor has anybody.<br />Stein: What do think the possibility that intelligent design might turn out to be the answer to some of the issues in genetics or Darwinian evolution?<br /><br />Dawkins then offers the following explanation for how life began:<br />\\"It could come about in the following way. It could be that at some earlier time in some part of the universe a civilization evolved by probably some kind of Darwinian means to a very, very high level of technology and designed a form of life that is seeded onto perhaps this planet. That is a possibility and an intriguing possibility. I suppose you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of our molecular biology, you might find a similar nature of some sort of designer. And that designer could well be a higher intelligence from elsewhere in the universe. But that higher intelligence itself would have had to come about by some explicable process.It couldn't have just jumped into existence spontaneously.\\"<br /><br />One could describe this explanation as a theory or faith. Dawkins has trouble objectively looking at how tied he is to Darwinism and how his dislike of God affects his ability to be objective. He injects something that is very personal for him, Darwin, into something that should be very impartial and objective, the beginning of life on the planet earth or the universe.<br />Why? Perhaps because he is competing with scientific reality, and that Darwin's theories do not explain how life began. Lacking this, he must create something, even if it out of a void; it turns out that it is an entertaining answer for Stein (who wisely let's him go on).<br /><br />The empirical question is whether or not he so attempts to discourage people to believe in God because he thinks that it dissuades people from believing in Darwinism.<br />Here are some quotes from readers of \\"The God Delusion,\\" that he includes in the paperback edition of the book.<br />\\"I'm a atheist, but I want to dissociate myself from your shrill, strident, intemperate, intolerant, ranting language,\\" says one entry.<br />Dawkins then compares his tone with that of restaurant criticism in leading London newspapers. He could probably well compare his wording with the highly discouraging Simon Cowell, who regularly rips apart contestants like they are pieces of meat waiting to be skewered. But Cowell is on TV and talking about something that is subjective; Dawkins is writing a book about science.<br /><br />There are many other examples in his book of how his view is skewed when it comes to considering God.<br />Dawkins likes \\"Imagine,\\" by John Lennon, a song that describes \\"a world with no religion.\\"<br />He adds to this:<br />\\"Imagine no suicide bombers, no 9/11, no 7/7, no crusades, no witch-hunts, no Gunpowder plot, no Indian partition, no Israeli/Palestinian wars, no Serb/Croat/Muslim massacres, no persecution of Jews as `Christ'killers,' noNorthern Ireland `troubles,' no `honor killings,' no shin-suited bouffant-haired televangelists fleecing gullible people of their money (`God wants you to give till it hurts'). Imagine no Taliban to blow up ancient statues, no flogging of female skin for the crime of showing an inch of it.\\"<br />He also laments that \\"and no religion too\\" is removed from some versions of Lennon's song. The problem with this summation, again, is that it lacks balance. What about the Salvation Army (started in England) the majority of hospitals in the United States that were founded by Christians and Jews?<br />In general, he believes the popularity of Christianity in the U.S. is something of an anomaly, a phenomena or disease that is to be diagnosed, and given the right amount of reason, will fade when Americans come to their senses. He also claims that to be a truly great scientist, one must remove all traces of faith in God, religion, Christianity.<br /><br />\\"Great scientists of our time who sound religious usually turn out not to be so when you examine their beliefs more deeply.\\"<br />The problem with this claim is that perhaps the greatest scientific experimenter the world has known, Michael Faraday, was a devout Christian.<br />Faraday is credited with making a discovery in 1821 that led to the development of the electric motor. Not long afterwards, he discovered the chemical benzene.<br />His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of the modern electric motor and making it viable for use in technology. Other discoveries include the magnetic field, electromagnetic induction, and diamagnetism and electrolysis.<br />Though he did not begin Royal Institution, a scientific organization in London, he is perhaps its most famous lecturer and participant, since he made many of his discoveries in the Mayfair section of the RI building.<br />In 1825, he began two traditions: Friday evening discourses and the Christmas lectures, which are lectures on science during Christmas time.<br />But Dawkins may be more interested in the fact that Faraday was an elder in the Sandemanian church and even delivered sermons to his congregation.<br />A brief description of Faraday's character can be bound in Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, 43 (June 1993): 92-95, by Phillip Eichman, Ball State University.<br />\\"The Christian Character of Michael Faraday as Revealed in His Personal Life and Recorded Sermons.\\"<br /><br />He trots out Albert Einstein as someone without belief in God. Ironically it is said that Einstein was so inspired by Faraday that he kept a photo of him on his desk.<br />Nonetheless, Einstein claimed that he did not believe in a personal God. He may have simply been behind on his New or Old Testament reading. Or he may have had trouble describing what he believes exactly, and as a brilliant mind, was required to be a spokesperson for organized religion. And he was not.<br />\\"To sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is something that our mind cannot grasp and whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only indirectly and as a feeble reflection, this is religiousness. In this sense I am religious.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins uses a quote from Carl Sagan who uses the physical laws that govern the universe to attempt to describe God.<br />\\". . . then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying . . . it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.<br />It may not be emotionally satisfying. But it must be fun to live on planet earth with the law of gravity and not fly off into outer space. Seeking to describe or use the law of gravity, he sees nothing beyond it. But if not God, then what? Wouldn't it make sense to pray to a God who created the law of gravity?<br /><br />Dawkins also quotes the last paragraph in \\"The Origin of the Species.\\"<br />\\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having originally breathed (by the Creator) into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"<br />The fact that in one of the editions, Darwin mentions breathed by the Creator, is telling. Also is the fact that Dawkins does not mention it in his book at all.
0060558121|5.0|1st book I've read from that author. Just excellent.<br />I am not usually a reader of sci-fi novels. This one is awesome.

B0012QCZ54|3.0|Where the girl wears the belly shirt. That's awesome. That's always my favorite part of this movie.<br />I prefer the style breakdancing to the power moves, it has plenty of both. I don't care for rap music but I can just pretend they're playing something else when I'm studying the moves.
B004FOA84A|4.0|After playing Lost City and enjoying it very much I looked for a similar game.  This game is almost as good.  I hope Fire Maple Games develops more like this.
0099579944|3.0|To say I was disappointed after the promise of Fifty Shades of Grey would be anu understatement. The charismatic Christian turned into a stalker and control freak, that makes the story creepier and Ana has lost all her original charm as she becomes obsessed with being seen with a good looking wealthy man. I loved the original story in this there is nothing new, it is a mere extension of the first novel. It's too much of a good thing, too Mills and Boon, too repetitive. I was sick of hearing about Ana not eating enough, about women looking at Christian and Ana being on his arm, the inner goddess, it started to irritate. The freshness of it's beginning did become darker in a tale of obsession, even some of the sex scenes were repetitive. I can only hope the last book makes up for where this one failed and gives something new and exciting. Maybe if this was to be the format one longer book would have been better.
B000KQF6X0|5.0|The version that being sold on here is a Canadian version, but don't worry it plays on US players.  I had the original DVD releases, which had VHS picture quality and never did a strong job of capturing Ridley Scott's dramatic shots.  The transfer to Blue Ray is one of the best transfers i've seen so far.  I've seen the movie 100 times and i've been recognizing new details int the background because of the enhanced picture quality.  This is a great Ridley Scott film set in the fantastic city Osaka.

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|loved this game &amp; had a great town created but the timers started being set to over 100 hours before I can do anything. had fun while it lasted but will be deleting this game. the creators need to read these reviews &amp; fix whatever is wrong with the software that makes these timers set that way....very frustrating!
0439023521|5.0|I read this book as part of a book club. It was an awesome book. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Very intense. Went to see the movie with the book club and that was just as great. I was eager to read the next book. Which we are now reading for the book club.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This comes SO close to the higher end PC office software packages. It needs the ability to create headers and footers, and insert page numbers. Dictionary lookup is a great addition; now let's see thesaurus lookups, and spell check. Adding headings and styles would be great as well. Finally, add functionality to import other dictionaries--I have the Merriam-Webster dictionary app on my Transformer Prime; I should be able to import this into OfficeSuite for use. This app is *almost* there--as it stands it's the most functional, versatile, usable office suite out there. The only thing that keeps it from a five-star review is the above comments, plus file compatibility issues with other office suite apps (QuickOffice, for example, doesn't always open .doc or .docx files edited in OfficeSuite).

B004YEJGEO|5.0|I always wanted to get myself that Khet laser game, but didn't want to spend $30. Refraction is a fun and entertaining take on using mirrors and prisms to redirect light beams to hit targets. This is the first game that I have paid for. I don't have a lot of games on my Kindle Fire, and have always gone for the free games and enjoy the occasional \\"free paid app of the day\\"; however, I feel that this was certainly well worth the 99 cents - and I am glad that I didn't splurge on Khet.<br /><br />Note: The prisms split primary colors (red, blue, yellow) into two beams AND combine secondary colors (green = blue + yellow, purple = red + blue, orange = red + yellow) back into primary colors. For example, in order to hit a green target, you might use your mirrors to direct a yellow beam and a blue beam into the same prism and then use another mirror to direct the resultant green light on to the target. The one criticism that I have of this really excellent game is that sometimes the prisms get \\"confused\\" and don't know quite what they are doing. This has led me to have to restart a level more than once because the prism just won't cooperate - and who wants to have to argue with an uncooperative prism.<br /><br />I am giving this game 5 stars, in spite of the occasional confused prism issue, because it really is outstanding. I hope that the developer will be able to create a toggle for the prism (beyond the beam move toggle that is already there) that will change the directions of the beam in relation to the prism so that you can determine which beam of beams enter and and which beam or beams exit.
1440503257|3.0|To begin with this is a very decent little cookbook that serves two purposes.<br /><br />First the Author is clearly a serious Harry Potter fan and second came up with an ingenious way to introduce American readers to British cooking by providing recipes linked to story placement in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />This makes for a viable reference guide and provides some insights into cultural differences in diet.<br /><br />However none of the recipes are original to the author and have been around long before the Harry Potter series. Not a problem but as the author tends to rename an item, Ex: Cauldron cakes are in fact pancakes, this might feel a bit misleading to the buyer.<br /><br />Overall this is a very nice cookbook, unfortunately the one thing that really works against it is that it is not original. The information is readily available elsewhere and that this is an 'Unofficial' tie-in to somebody else's work. Having to stamp a disclaimer on the cover & every other page in the book just feels a bit off. Which is too bad, as despite being an adult cookbook this could be educational for kids.
159562015X|1.0|As mentioned by others here, this book is nigh useless if bought used.  But, it wasn't made clear to me at the point of sale that it would be.  So, they want me to go out and buy a brand-new one.  That galls me.  It would be so easy to sell access codes online, but they won't because they want you to buy a new book.  And, they make excuses for why they won't sell access codes and why they won't let you take the test twice with an access code you've bought, but it's pretty obvious they only do that to make sure nobody ever takes an assessment without paying retail for a shiny new book.<br /><br />I paid next to nothing for my used copy and just a couple of bucks for the shipping.  My company would probably even reimburse me for buying a new copy.  But, I'll be damned if I give Gallup the satisfaction.  There's some worthwhile insight in the book (without the assessment), but they aren't getting more than 1 star from me because of their objectionable business practices.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|There are some problems with the game. It will not allow me to invite friends being just one of them
B005PZ87WI|3.0|As far as Criminal Minds episodes and season premieres go, this one rates pretty low. Sure, it brought back Emily Prentiss from the \\"dead\\", something which they'd already revealed at the end of season six, but the whole format of flashback interspersed with a hearing was a tired old format that made the whole episode transparent and boring.<br /><br />It starts off with a rooftop fight and suddenly the unsub turns around and it's Ian Doyle. Hotch is out in Pakistan on temporary task force duty but apparently it's unimportant enough for him to just hop on a plane at the drop of a hat to come back home to investigate Doyle. Early on, they offer the teasing statement that \\"two of your agents are dead\\", but they quickly shake that off when you find out it's two random agents you've never seen or heard of before. JJ is back and suddenly she's gone from media mouth to field agent.<br /><br />They chase some unknown baddies connected to Doyle and some silly scene at a plane happens and ends with a weak climax. Of course, the outcome is predictable and although an oath is used at the end for dramatic flair, it came off as Hollywood cheese and really disappointed me. It's starting to feel like this show is turning in the direction of SVU, which is honestly quite sad.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|woah. this game is fun. it reminds me of a game with Mario and Luigi. I love this game. also the leprechaun is soooooo cute. I don't know if I spelled leprechaun right. oh well.
B004LP10PO|3.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie until the end and I will tell you why,I do not like the fact it is a Rich Man who is the Mastermind(as if being Rich is a Crime,some subtle message in there perhaps on the rich.),Secondly,towards the end which bothers me the most is when asked why he does it,it is because of \\"The System\\"Granted this is 1968 and sadly very in vogue to be such.But I see it as an PsuedoIntellectual Jab at society and the way it suppose to be,There is nothing wrong with the system.(Only when the Left is in power.)From the start though the film,the score and just the tension is just right,everything is there making it a 5 star movie but not a masterpiece.It cannot compare to a Favorite of Mine \\"Bullit\\" or Le Mans(despite a Mustang and Charger in one film and in Le Mans a Porsche.)But those are different categories yet still Classic Steve McQueen,Is this the ultimate heist film?I would say no,it could have been but that one little remark at least for me.The Acting is great although Faye Dunaway is not my type of actress.If you want to view as art so be it. Aside from the tension building throughout(despite the obvious and the surprise ending),the film has good moments,Beautiful Rolls-Royce,A Great Dune Buggy ripping through the sand of that land of liberals(NewEngland);The Plane flying sequences as well,the Cadillac,the Polo Playing with Faye's Character in the Ferrari.I am by no means upset it is not a car film,I like the idea behind the film it's premise;But Personally I felt at towards the end it did not do it for me except of course the very end right before the credits,Just my two cents however.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really fun game.  works great onnmy kindle.  do not try to play the game without wifi it will change all the counters to 500 minutes.

I liked the plot, but the plot was actually such a small part of the book that I finally gave up and no longer care what happens to the characters.  Pass the Captain Crunch!
B006ZZCLV0|1.0|I am so glad to be able to comment on this Hunger Games trilogy! I got two of the same book! I ordered this trilogy and now can't read it until I get the FIRST book HUNGER GAMES.I have TWO of the RED book MOCKINGJAY! I have gotten back to the place who sold it to me and have not heard an answer. I have TWO of the same book and they have not addressed my concern. I wonder if they have made this same error to other customers? Not good business. I also heard that someone is selling the first part of the trilogy so I tried to do an even trade since she was finished. I as of yet have not heard from her either. I need help so I can start to read my books. For now they are just sitting on the couch waiting for the error by the store I purchased from to contact me and correct the error. I am so disappointed!!!
B006X08FDA|1.0|I believe there were only four songs on this CG. They should have just put these four songs on another<br /> CD. ONLY FOUR SONGS! I like most of the Carolins Chocolate stuff but, i felt gyped with Leaving Eden.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|It was Father's day and I wanted to gift something special for my dad. Watches were always his favorite. He has a good collection of watches and I wanted to add one more to it. This time my choice was Tissot as this brand is not in his collection. This stainless steel Chronograph watch looked great on display and even better when I actually saw it for real. My dad was so impressed that he hugged and thanked me. I learnt the watch is both scratch and water resistant. An ideal gift for your loved ones.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game to play when you are borad. I love this game SO much! Moms and dads don't need to intertain
0545265355|4.0|I picked up this young adult hit book. Why this though I skipped Harry Potter? Not sure. Thought maybe this sci-fi might have trenchant social criticism. It does not have any running social commentary, which makes it's criticism more biting, because it is so part of the whole plot. Yes, it is your typical young adult romance story of a feminine hero having to chose between two unconditionally devoted men...for the most part. Take away the creative setting and the actions generated by the hunter-hunted scenario and it can be another Twilight book. Admittedly, the action is riveting in the first book, Hunger Games. Though the two that follow has diminishing thrill as it is a weak repeat of the same hunter-hunted dynamics of the first one, each subsequent one getting more incredible to swallow. Yet, even with this diminished return, the action and the chapter-ending cliff hangers will make you turn the pages. I finished the three in a week. But it is this disinterest in social commentary that makes this book a biting social-criticism. The creation of Hunger-Games, where the children of the poor are forced to wage death-matches, is so far fetched in its inhumane cruelty we stand at a comfortable distance. We can hate the enemies, \\"The Capitol\\" because they are monsters compared to us. But the distance is illusory. Soon enough, we get to the many description of sumptuous food and binge eating and realize that we are not much different from the people of the \\"Capitol\\" who are so engrossed in their need for consumption, that they are blind to the cruelties created by their thoughtless consumption. Does not our insatiable consumption create an economy that exploits the poor and creates regions which serve like the \\"districts\\" where a whole village and generation is enslaved to a single labor market, the diamonds of Zimbabwe, the coal mines of West Virginia. With that uncomfortable realization, you begin to ask, do we have our own form of Hunger-Games in the civil wars thatturn children into soldiers which too us are mere video clips in our news, a sadistic reality TV?
0679746048|2.0|MY EXPECTATIONS - I was very much looking forward to reading this book, after watching, and loving the movie (it is one of my favorite movies). I bought the book, with expectations of emotional depth, a coherent storyline, and in short, something that would make me both laugh and cry. This book did neither of the two. I wanted the author to engross me in her life story; so much so, that I'd be able to identify with her and shed tears of sadness for her. I also expected a happy ending showing her recovery, and resulting in me crying happy tears for her. If none of this was possible, I at least expected to be entertained to the point where I laughed or couldn't let go of the book. None of my expectations were met - I didn't laugh, I sure as hell didn't cry, wasn't at all entertained, and it took me 7 or 8 reading sessions to finish the mere 168 pages.<br /><br />NO SUBSTANCE/DEPTH - I'm sure a lot of BPD people out there (like myself) would like to lose ourselves in a story about a fellow sufferer (Ms. Kaysen) and be able to identify closely with her. But, her weird sarcastic and indifferent tone throughout the book makes it very difficult to do so. It seems like she's constantly whining about stuff or doesn't care about what's going on. It makes you wonder - what message she is trying to convey ? It is really hard to grasp the point of this book. If she doesn't care about her condition or her life experiences, why did she bother writing this book ? I think readers of this book will be confused by her absolute apathy about her condition, her treatment, and everything else she talks about. Also, I was disappointed by how shallow her descriptions of her own experiences and that of others was. There is no real storyline ... no real flow; with the constant, random, jumps through time, any storyline, if present, is entirely lost. Before you can begin to understand one part of the story, she has already jumped to some other random irrelevant part of her life, so forget about trying to make sense of it. No emotional value - I felt completely numb throughout my reading.<br /><br />WRITING STYLE TOO ECCENTRIC, AND ULTIMATELY BORING - Now, given that the book does not have much substance, you might hope that, at least, it entertains. And I was definitely prepared for an eccentric style of writing, given that a good percentage of writers are mentally ill to some degree, and I knew that Ms. Kaysen had BPD. However, to say that Ms. Kaysen's writing is eccentric would be a gross understatement. She jumps back and forth, constantly, from past to present to future, with no clear indication as to why. I understand that flashbacks can be important in a story, especially one about a mental illness, but this book just jumps all over time, and with no apparent significance to the story or the message being conveyed. Also, the most random things are given too much importance (like, for example, how much she hates the dentist). It kinda makes the reader wonder - what the heck is she really writing about ? What is her goal here ? Now, this randomness would be okay, if it were entertaining, and some books do pull that off, I suppose. But, unfortunately, this book fails to do so. It just comes off as dull and pointless, and ultimately, a desperate yet unsuccessful attempt at being humorous and entertaining.<br /><br />GROSSLY SCIENTIFIC STUFF THROWN IN THE MIX - There is an entire chapter wasted on some totally hardcore scientific stuff about the brain that totally detracts from the rest of the book. If she doesn't care about anything, as is evident from her tone throughout the book, why did she bother researching all this scientific crap that the average person won't understand ? I couldn't read more than a paragraph ... skipped the entire chapter<br /><br />NO ENDING - The \\"ending\\" if you can call it that, is entirely wasted on an account of some stupid, meaningless, outing with a former lover. I expected something much more substantial and meaningful,and showing that she has recovered. No such thing, and it makes you wonder - did Susanna Kaysen really recover ? Or better yet, did she care whether she recovered ?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE - This book is too eccentric to be sufficiently understood, and it is boring. It has no substance/depth, and does not entertain. VERY DISAPPOINTING ! I think another way to describe this book would be \\"a sneak preview of what it's like to be in a loony bin ... and nothing more\\"
B00028HBKC|5.0|It was graphic, but it was well worthy the money.  I plan on having a tradition of viewing this video every Good Friday.
B004EPZ070|5.0|The romantic comedy genre has gotten such a bad rap lately -- and far too often for good reason.  \\"Something Borrowed\\" shouldn't be lumped in with those movies that are formulaic and in which the actors don't even try to bring the material to life.  The casting is perfect -- Kate Hudson is the embodiment of \\"Darcy\\" and Ginnifer Goodwin and Colin Egglesfield are tremendous as the couple whose timing is less than ideal.  Also, big shout out to the supporting cast - John Krasinki (so funny), Steve Howey (funny, also), and Ashley Williams with a somewhat bittersweet turn as \\"Clare.\\"  I read the book and can see where they compressed some things in the movie but you still get the complete picture of two people who after years of trying to make other people happy finally ask for what they both want -- each other.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game works great on the kindle and is fun fun fun :D<br />i think this game is ylone of he greatest in the app store.....all they need is temple run jetpack joyride rat on a skateboard and some other awsome games that i really really want
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|If you're going to make an album to demonstrate why people still listen to these guys decades after John Bonham bought the farm, this would be it. The fact that they priced it so reasonably is a big bonus as well. From the art, to remastering and song selection, this establishes these guys as a class act, now and forever. Ramble on.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|LOL! It's really not funny cause i wasted 4 buck on it! But, it was poorly written and directed! I can't beleive Micheal Douglas and Antonio Banderas were in it, OMG! really lousy movie, Plese Don't rent it or buy it! With the actors and even Gina Corono in it, it could have been a decent movie. If it had a better director, story line and budget! i really beleive that! But i rented this movie and watched 10 min of it and erased it, it was terrible! Save ur money, Please! I think Gina can make a decent movie and be in the likes of Van Dam or Segal! But she needs Direction and money for the film! someone please help her make a decent movie, i would pay for a better movie, but this one just plain sucked!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This set of books was amazing.  There were surprises at every turn. I found myself smiling, laughing, crying and getting angry reacting to the characters and situations.  Amazing is a little understated! I loved this series!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game gives you more chances to get items for free.<br />It is nice not to have to buy things.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I despise exercising and I hate sweating, but I decided to give this a try after reading the good reviews and being attracted by the short time workout. It took me around 2 months to complete the 30 days and I stayed in level one for a whopping 14 days, but by the end, I felt really great and could finally complete the workout to my satisfaction. One downside is that I had to move out of Level 2 rather quickly because it was wreaking havoc on my knees with all the jumping.<br /><br />I ended up losing 11 pounds over the course of my 30 days and once I shake off this latest lazy bout, I'll do another 30 days. I hope to complete this video a total of 2 more times this year to take off an additional 20 pounds by the end of the year.<br /><br />I should note that I didn't diet. I ate a little smarter, but in general didn't restrict the type of food I ate. I probably would have lost a lot more weight if I had. Anyway, the DVD is so cheap that I got more than my money's worth out of it. At the bargain price it's at, what have you got to lose, really?
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game. Great graphics, ran very smoothly on the Kindle Fire and was fun....then the glitches came. Started locking up. Then the timers reset to crazy hours. Very disappointed that Gameloft has made no attempt to fix this problem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In my opinion, The Hunger Games was an excellent read. The author makes you care about the people in her story. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an evenings entertainment.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|good story and veriety of rooms to find hidden items. i am impressed by the games from g5. i love the mystery puzzle finding stuff kinda game the portal was also wonderful. all games have great graphics also but they are pricey

B0064742MU|5.0|Love this episode! It is one of my favorites. So cute! I love their love story! Snow White and Prince Charming forever :)
0767817710|4.0|Fantastic movie with a star studded cast. I like Russell Crowe's performance he actually outperformed sharon Stone and Gene Hackman despite him not having many lines in the script.<br /><br />Great storyline as well based on Sharon Stone's character seeking revenge for her father's death at the hands of Hackman's character. Russell Crowe's character in a battle to put his former life as an outlaw behind him and trying to life of a christian.<br /><br />Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!

B005K17RU0|4.0|love this app.  I spend time with my father that is in bad health in Florida.  This app helps me plan the time I am down there with activities depending on the weather.  This is a helpful tool no matter where you are.
0439023513|4.0|The third book in the trilogy was really interesting, but it started out very slow. During the first 150 pages, I actually questioned whether I should keep reading. Encouraged by some of my friends and family that had already read the book, I continued and I'm glad I did. Unfortunately, I think this was a disservice to the author because the end of the book felt extremely rushed. It seemed as though the end had so much content that it was too much to digest all at one time.<br /><br />This book was a great ending, but I think it would have been better if the first 150 pages were merged into 50 pages.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I had to purchase a router for my kindle since I do not have wifi in my area and it has a strong signal per my analyzer.  I was at a different location several days ago and checked my wi-fi analyzer.  Another wi-fi showed up HH020 but I did not know how to sign onto that or even if I could.  I have no complaints
0439023491|5.0|Of all three of the books in this trilogy, this was by far the best one. From the start to the finish of this book, I couldn't put it down. The author held my attention the whole time. There were a lot of twists and turns that made me wonder what would happen next.
B000OHZJKK|5.0|Early Elvis Costello music is the best & this would be my favorite of his early albums.  Virtually every song is a hit!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Had to see what all the hype was about.  The first book is just OK.  But, I really enjoyed the 2nd as well as the 3rd in the series.  The 2nd and 3rd book have more of a story to follow than just sex.
0618526412|4.0|I must say that I listened to the audio version.  I'm sorry that I don't have it in front of me to give the reader's name as she did a wonderful job.  I think the reader can add or detract a lot from a spoken word book and this woman was so good, with all the characters, male, female, white, black, young old, educated or not.  I truly felt that I was listening to the characters themselves.  After having read a number of negative reviews I'm think that maybe listening to it rather than reading is in print is the way to go....don't know.<br /><br />I was drawn into the story from the beginning and it didn't let go of me till the end of the last disk.  I actually felt sad when I saw that I was nearing the end.  I kept thinking of what a wonderful writer McCullers was as I listened.  It was only until after it was finished and I found myself strangely depressed that I had second thoughts about the book.  I was glad to come to Amazon and discover that others shared my less than enthusiastic opinion, based on one fact---it was depressing!<br /><br />I don't need what has become known as a Hollywood Happy Ending, with everything tied up in a Big Bow to give me a sense of satisfaction about a book.  I have loved many dark works and don't have a problem with reading about tragedy.  And I like a lot of Southern Gothic novels.  But I think that, in order to get a sense of satisfaction from a work of art that there must be some sort of resolution to it.  Just describing, in great detail, the woes and misfortunes of a group of people, with no point to ite, might be better called a documentary, except, of course that this is fiction.  I was taught, way back in grade school, to look for character development in a novel, asking how the characters change due to the circumstances in which they find themselves.  Maybe that was too simplistic?  It does give a certain sense of purpose to reading and writing it.  (Dr. Copeland was very big on \\"purpose.\\")<br /><br />Spoiler alert:  I maysay things that will spoil it for someone who hasn't read it.<br /><br />What is good is the actual writing.  The descriptions are just right, not too self-consciously \\"writerly.\\"  The characters are all well-drawn and I found them totally believable (although, as I said above, having a great reader really helped there).  I liked the plot structure---showing a small group of individuals in a town separately and gradually having them interact with one another.  The writer obviously had a lot of compassion for each character, which comes across; each one, although imperfect, is shown with a certain amount of gentleness and even affection, in a totally non-gooey way.<br /><br />I loved the language, especially that of the less educated Blacks, like Portia.  Portia is probably the most lovable character in the book.  She's the only one who deals with her problems, doesn't just sit around and moon about them as do the others.  She tries in the only ways she knows how to bring the family together and she initiates the only change in the novel---bringing her father to live with the others in the family compound.<br /><br />The center of the book is Mick Kelly, who must be the alter-ego for the writer.  We are privvy to more of her thoughts and feelings than of any of the others and so we do root for her.  The problem is that her early spunk and enthusiasm for life just dwindles out at the end.  She has a lively, warm encounter with the boy next door and they spend an idyllic day in the woods, which culminates in her first sexual encounter.  But then she quickly turns off--completely shuts this and the boy out of her mind.  Why?  Soon after, she quits school which she loved and takes a job in a dime store.  The plan was to save money to buy a radio and then a piano and pursue her love of music.  But at the end, we see her just frittering away her money with trinkets and treats, she's lost her spirit and there's no hope given for anything better for her.<br /><br />The other\\"center\\" is the mysterious Mr. Singer.  I loved Mr. Singer, as did everyone else in the story.  He's a deaf mute with the seeming superior spiritual virtures of a Buddha or a Christ.  Drunks sober up in his presence, hysterics calm down, all the troubled people of the book run to Mr. Singer for calm and spiritual balm on their souls.  The problem I had with this character is that he is portrayed in a such an exalted way that there is no sense of his final act.  His incredible love for the childish, selfish Antonopolous who only cares for food just didn't make sense to me, nor gibe with what was supposed to be his great wisdom.  Well maybe we, the readers were fooled into projecting too much goodness into Mr. Singer, just as the townspeople did.  But I think that was a flaw in the book.<br /><br />Besides this we are exposed to a long list of terrible events---a very young boy accidentally shoots his little girl friend and ruins her life. a Black man undergoes a  horrific trauma in prison,  the restaurant owner has fallen out of love with his wife and she dies, another relative has a hopeless attachment to her abusive spouse, Mick's sister gets sick and has to quit her job, which puts further stress on the already strapped finances of the family, the town drunk and would-be-revolutionary keeps on drinking and eventually leaves town, Mick's father just can't earn a decent living....etc. etc. etc.  People bump into each other, have encounters of a sort but don't really connect in a meaningful way. The fat selfish mute gets sick and dies and Singer shoots himself.  No one is changed, no one grows or learns anything from these troubles.  There is a distinct lack of \\"triumph of the human spirit over adversity.\\"  The only attempt at wrapping things up is the observation that the restaurant owner makes, that people made a lot of effort...or something.  It was a very pale attempt at resolution after living through so much pain.<br /><br />I read here that the novelist wrotethis when she was 23 so I'm wondering if she might have written a better, fuller, work if she had done this when she was more mature.  Who knows?

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games takes a novel idea and makes it engrossing. Not only is the plot riviting but the characters are equally interesting. I think the second book is better than the first. The third book started slow but then achieve the quality of the first two. An easy and great read...perfect for a long airplane trip.
B007AMMHSY|3.0|A well done but creepy movie. Hard to watch at times and the ending seemed abrupt. You will not walk away with a feel good feeling but you will ponder this for a long time.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Totally unrealistic, anyone with half a brain knows that wolves don't act in that manner.  A lone wolf does not run full bore at a group of people.  Wolves are opportunists and pack hunters.  I would rather see a monster movie with a mythical creature than a movie about real animals acting totally out of charecter.  AND THE ENDING!  Really?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun and cute. my son loves it and the graphics are good. wish some steps didnt require a social network.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app.  My husband and I allow our children to play educational games and read children's books on our Kindle Fire but there were certain games (zombie, shoot-em-up type things) that my husband and I enjoy but weren't comfortable allowing our kids to have access too.  It was the issue of child-locking the device that had me a little hesitant to buy a Fire in the first place but this app absolutely solves that problem.  It allows me to block access to apps that I feel are inappropriate for my kids and allows me to block internet access.  Since our children don't have unlimited access to our Fire, this app suits our needs very nicely.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the Wool Omnibus edition and the First Shift in a little more than a week and often found myself thinking about the book as I went through my day doing what I need to do to keep a shelter over my head.  Now, I'm going thru a bit of withdrawal and I find myself thinking about how the future events in the insane and fantastic world of Hugh Howey may unfold when the next volume is published. I'm treating my withdrawal symptoms with intermittent injections of Half Way Home and try to make the limited supply of this drug available until the next volume comes up.
044042321X|4.0|I really enjoyed this graphic novel. I like the artwork and the way it expands upon scenes from the book. It is a quick read and the worst part of the book for me was the fact that it ended so early in the series. I will definitely by the next volumes as they become available.

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I loved this movie. Has the tempo, mystery, and humor of Indiana Jones. It thrilled me like the first time I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. The animiation was spectacular. Can't wait for the sequels - and I hope there are many more.
0545265355|5.0|My first introduction to this series was \\"oh goodie, yet another teen mania twilight bandwagon\\" and I don't do bandwagons, i boycott them! My second encounter was a CNN readers debate on Hollywood parading sexy teen girls in next to nothing with weapons and how HUNTING in our current society isn't a necessity it's a soulless sport and just another excuse to kill.  At that moment i vowed to never watch the movie or touch the books with a ten foot pole.  Then, my best friend roped me into a sample reading on the grounds I was so much like the girl in this book it was beyond hilarious.  Four days later the Epilogue became my mantra for living.  I haven't seen the movie yet, and I loathed the Peeta character choice at first glance of the trailer, but the Books are genius all the way to The End.  It's not a book about hunting and it's not twilight saga; it's a story about a revolution, the girl who unintentionally paid the price to inspire it, and the people who gave of their lives so she would.  Life isn't a bowl of cherries for any of us, humanity is more often than not despicable and disgusting, but if we are to continue on we must count every goodness we see in each other and brave each day helping one another survive it so we all might one day live it.
B000NA22C6|4.0|First off, I've read the story this movie is based on and the movie was way better in my opinion.  Not all Stephen King stories end up as better than okay movies...in fact, very few of them do.  This is one of them and I'd have to give the praise mainly to choosing Johnny Depp to play the main character.<br /><br />Mort Rainey is a semi-famous writer who is going through a nasty divorce from his wife, who has another man in her life.  He retires to a cabin and starts work, only to be interrupted by a man named Shooter, who claims that Mort stole his story.  Mort is already on the edge due to his divorce and this sets him down the garden path of self-destruction.  He stumbles around the cabin in a ratty old bathrobe and with messed up hair half the time (a real plus if you enjoy seeing Johnny Depp looking like he just woke up in the morning after a hard night out) and can't seem to prove to the man that he wrote the story first and can't seem to deal with his wife leaving him for someone else.<br /><br />If just about anyone else had been playing the part of Mort, you would have had much less sympathy for his character...especially near the end of the movie.  As it was, the final scenes created odd feelings in the audience.  I won't give it away, but this dissonance was fascinating since the movie basically gave you everything from Mort's perspective and made you feel what he felt, even if you knew it was wrong.<br /><br />Writers might find this movie even more interesting.  Johnny Depp fans will like, especially since he's in just about scene and does a great understated job of bringing the miserable life of Mort Rainey to reality.  It's not Johnny's best movie by any means, but its oddly and secretly fascinating all the same.

B005EGXTL2|4.0|I have to say first up that I'd never heard of the Hunger Games until the movie was released and decided that I'd investigate what the hype was all about.<br /><br />I read the trilogy over the past two weeks and was thoroughly absorbed by them. I can't say that I would rate Suzanne Collins as a great writer, but she tells a story well worth the time to read and understand.<br /><br />I've read a number of reviews which have bagged the final book as somehow not providing a fitting or satisfactory ending. I have to disagree. I would have been disappointed with anything remotely happy ever after.<br /><br />The writing isn't great but the story is a good one.

Nobody is going to tell me what I like or HOW something is supposed to sound.  I'll listen to the music and if I like it, then I like it.  If I don't, then I don't.  But I'm not going to tell somebody else they should like a certain music because I do.  Or dislike music because I don't like it.  What I'm saying is just decide for yourself.  I listened to this CD and I liked it.  That's all I'm going to say about it.  Judge music for yourself.  You know what you like.

B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White's first ever solo record...and I must say, in my own opinion, is amazing. If anyone is looking for a White stripes sound in this record than you might be a little disappointed (with the exception of \\"Sixteen Saltines\\", \\"Freedom at 21\\", and \\"Missing pieces\\") which those sounds have a little white stripes sound to it, which are a couple of my favorite tracks on this album. But anyone willing to explore Jack White as an ARTIST than I don't think anyone will be disappointed in this album. There is a bit of a country sound (especially in the title track \\"Blunderbuss\\") but I think White's voice fits it perfectly. There is some honky tonky styles in a couple of songs like \\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" and \\"Trash Tongue Talker,\\" which is a great track with White providing some nice raspy vocals that go perfectly with the song. The ending track \\"Take Me With You When You Go,\\" has some peculiar harmonies that draw you in. After a couple listens you will see what amazing song it is, especially in the middle break when it starts getting faster and Jack brings in an awesome guitar solo. There is a bit of everything in this album and I think it is truly an amazing album from an amazing artist. One of the best artist in our generation I'd say. I highly recommend this album!!

B006W0QOF2|5.0|Dearest review reader,<br /><br />  My new favorite movie is \\"Drive\\" Starring Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. It has action, a great story-line, and the soundtrack is excellent! I would also like to include, the movie is so \\"1980's.\\" An example of this is you must wait to guess what the actors may be thinking, and feel it with them. As opposed to today's movies where most comedies have someone speaking their every thought either under thir breath or as interuption of their own thought-or someone else's. In fact, this movie is placed in the essence of a quiet man. Where patience and silence was once a virtue. The silence of this movie made it more \\"real\\" to everyone in my household. Action-packed as it was, it was a beautiful romance as well. Oh and I loved the bowling jacket! Going to go look for one for myself now!

0061914177|4.0|If you have ever wanted a cheerleader for making a business on the Internet,  Gary Vaynerchuk is your guy. in Crush It!, Gary states, no, evangelizes his case for following a dream and making the jump to Internet business. The force of his personality leaps from the page, energizing the reader to absolutely believe they, too, can \\"crush it\\".<br /><br />Gary immigrated to America with his parents from Belarus when he was three. From an early age, he began selling. He sold baseball cards, building a small empire at his school before branching out to trade shows and the mall. His success was cut short when he turned fifteen and started working in the family wine shop. Even though he couldn't drink the wares, he studied the wine guides and magazines to learn the lingo and be able to convince shoppers who came in for a bottle to take home a case. Then, during college, Gary discover YouTube.<br /><br />Embracing the videos and convincing his father to let him, he started an Internet TV show dedicated to wine. Gary, who wasn't happy being stuffy and pretentious like other wine critics. He used his personality and \\"earthy\\" ways to describe wine (including a NY Jets spit bucket) in a video blog. In a few short months, sales increased over 500%.<br /><br />Vaynerchuk is convinced everyone can accomplish the same exciting feat of building and online brand and attracting a large following. From there, dreams come true (his dream is to buy the Jets and I believe he will somehow pull it off someday). Through out the book, as he discusses his beliefs on building an online business with the devotion most reserve for sports teams. His energy is infectious.<br /><br />While light on detail, Gary lays out some of the methods for creating an audience. He discusses the importance of building a brand, creating great content and being available on every platform. What's is most valuable, I believe, is his energy on the subject. He literally jumps off the page to motivate and make a believer out of the reader. The first time I read Crush It!, I was put off by the enthusiasm. This time through, however, it infected me and motivated me to start thinking about where my passion lies and how to leverage it.<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of detail on how to get started. I was hoping for a little more concrete detail. This book doesn't have it, instead containing general concepts and discussions about some venues to be aware of while building an online empire. I had to go searching in other places to find the  detail and mentorship I wanted. Still, Vaynerchuk is a pretty good cheerleader.er out of the reader.

B0079R8KXG|4.0|I was one of the first people to order the Kindle Fire last year. At the same time I ordered a case for it also made by Marware, called the MacroShell Folio. See it at the link below:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HSG3TC/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00<br /><br />It was the lightest in weight at the time, and was offered in a charcoal gray color. The case looks great, and I've liked it, as it hasn't added to the weight and has kept my Fire protected. I don't have a scratch on it and don't have a film over the screen. This one is light too, just slightly heavier than the MacroShell Folio, but the material looks like vinyl, whereas the MacroShell-Folio has a nice sleek look, that never buckles. It looks great. They both hold the Fire in place with the brackets provided and both have a strap.<br /><br />The biggest advantage in this \\"Vibe\\" version over the MacroShell-Folio is the stand feature. This one stays in place so well. The original one I got, (the MS-Folio) stand is supported only by a groove in which the flap fits to support the stand. It often times slips out of that groove. This Vibe just folds into place and stays put. If you're reading in bed like I do, this is a good feature. You can set it on a pillow in front of you, and it's quite sturdy and handy. All you have to do is tap the right side to turn the page.  The M-Shell Folio needs a flat surface like a table to keep it from moving so it will stay in the groove that supports the stand. If I'm reading in bed I can't put it on my lap or pillow.  I have to hold it in my hand like a book.  If I nod off, which is pretty likely, I read so late at night, I could drop it.  This model is better for reading in bed, or anywhere you need for it to stay in the upright position.<br /><br />So, these are the positives for this one:<br /><br />1) The Stand<br />2) Color: this one is red and easy to spot in a bag or car.<br />3) The price is good on either one. As of this writing they are similarly priced.<br /><br />The negative is that it looks like vinyl, not like real leather. The red is a bit bright too, I would prefer a darker red. My thanks to Amazon's Vine Program for the opportunity to preview this case. I think I will end up using this one more. I haven't taken it off since I got it a few weeks ago.<br /><br />PS: I also love, love, my Fire. I use it more than my iPad.br /><br />The negative is that it looks like vinyl, not like real leather. The red is a bit bright too, I would prefer a darker red.

0345803485|4.0|This is the first \\"erotic\\" romance novel I've read and I must say I'm a bit surprised. It was not at all what I was expecting, to be quite frank I was a little disappointed. The sex scenes were timid and repetitive. I would think that for a book that is about such a hardcore type of sex she could have at least used proper terms for anatomy other then 'sex'. Though I was a little frustrated by the descriptions of the love scenes I did enjoy the books, reading all 3 in a matter of days. I did like that even though this book is about a submissive relationship the female lead never gave up her free will completely and sense of self. I did feel like the main characters Ana and Christian were a little similar to Bella and Edward of \\"Twilight\\". This was a little disconcerting to me because I hated \\"Twilight\\"!! Christians family dynamic was also similar to that of \\"Twilight\\". With the second and third book in this serious I started to get a little bored. It became really repetitive, the sex, the story, the relationship, everything! It really left much to be desired.

Thank goodness for their filtering...*smiling*<br /><br />I must say, Fifty Shades was an easy and compelling read. Initially, I just got the sample but within 10 minutes of reading, I realized there was no way I cant buy this book.<br />So, I stepped into the world of BDSM and I LOVED IT!. The book incorporated dialog with 2 characters as if the story plays out on screen.<br />I keep hearing buzz of maybe a screen adaptation of the book. Im already sike about that.<br /><br />Well, I'm on to book number 2 of the trilogy.<br /><br />Fan of Ana and Christian,<br /><br />Shauntasia

B007UWBQEU|5.0|This is just an outstanding collection of marterial by Carrie Underwood.  Six songs on the album are from really good to just outstanding.  Good Girl, Who Are You, Blown Away, Two Black Cadillacs, Cupids Got A Shotgun, and See You Again are the best of the album.  Have to admit I'm not a sappy song listener so the rest might interest those that are.  This is really just a great album with more good songs on it than you'd expect to find on three albums collectively.  If you're a country music fan and like Carrie Underwood, you absolutley will not be disappointed with Blown Away....

I spent way too long trying to get through it because it was so simplistic and unrealistic.<br /><br />The writer doesn't allow the reader to have their own imagination, it's too obvious and has no story, no plot, no ending. Its just stupid sex and they do the same sex over and over. Bad just Bad.....

B00479SVBU|5.0|The product was as advertised.  My goal was to use it in my garage and play music from a usb stick.  I tried to use a small battery charger for a power supply and found it will not work.  Then I went to Radio Shack and found a 120v to 12v converter that had a cig. lighter receiver.  The converter has some filtering and and powered up the Sound Fly.  I then dialed to an unused FM frequency on a Bose receiver and used the shuffle function, music has been playing ever since.  Great product.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy all the games I also like that the skill levels are for different ages!  Excellent download.  Very fun games.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is lots of fun and a good time killer. I play it in my spare time on my lunch brake.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This app is very nice eye candy. It might be a little on the large size but graphics always take space. It is easy to use, good information, and I like the way it looks. Very happy with this app.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|a good game but on wave 24 the whole thing stopped if I pressed play game on the menu it would. never  stop loading.  it also gave me a message that said I have to uninstall this game and install it again in order to play
B0073PZU82|3.0|This movie had a twist toward the end, which is why I liked it. I would definitely watch it again.
0345803485|1.0|I am constantly shocked the most popular books in the U.S. tend to read as if they were written for teenagers - seems to speak volumes about the state of affairs here.  This book is awful - how it is a NYT Bestseller is beyond me!  The contrived interactions between all of the characters were painful to read.  One minute Christian is non-committal, the next he's jealously guarding Ana against (gasp!) people who talk to her at work.  Really - if you want dumbed down sex scenes by all means read this book.  To me it was a total waste of money.
B0073PZN8O|1.0|This movie was very boring. I even turned it off and picked up on it the next day because I just couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. Plus, Justin Timberlake can't act.
B0078JOAOI|4.0|Love the series!  Went a little slow for a couple, maybe three episodes this season, and I'm not without a few other complaints that have already been mentioned by others...but overall it's been fabulous.  Luckily the show varies from the graphic novel to a pretty solid degree, so we've had some surprises along the way, and this is a good thing.<br /><br />On this particular episode, the song that begins to play over the closing credits really caught my ear.  The band is Clutch, whom I had heard of, but was not familiar with at all.  The track is called \\"The Regulator\\" from an album called 'Blast Tyrant'.  Just picked this up today and......Wow!  Outstanding stuff, especially for those who enjoy ballsy, powerful and well played hard rock with just a smidge of blues tossed in.  Would highly recommend, as this Montgomery County, Maryland outfit should really be better known.  Check 'em out, and here's to TWD Season Three starting up again in the fall!
B005K17RU0|5.0|We recently had another weather ap that was prepossessed into our phones that drove me insane. I would try to type in my city and the only options it would show would be some place in Europe or some third world country I've never heard of. this ap is simple to use, and has options my wife and I both like. To sum it up, we love it!
1469984202|5.0|My husband bought me a Kindle for my birthday.  I'm not normally a science fiction kinda gal.  But when I saw the reviews and read the sample I couldn't wait for my Kindle to arrive!<br /><br />The characters were engaging.  It was fun the way you could feel the claustrophobia of it all.  Living underground.  There were parts when I should've been getting stuff done and instead read.  There was no break in the action and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen!  I don't think I could ever be as brave as Juliette was in the water.  From there on I couldn't stop.<br /><br />The Q&A after the end on the Kindle edition was a total charmer and the epilogue after that made me want to keep turning \\"pages\\"...I want more please!
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Just a quick review-Very touching movie of those lives affected by the viel of death or near death experience. Great acting, story and music. The ending is wonderful for those who like a sentimental close. I loved Cecil de France especially. The music is terrific throughout and listen to the end credits score as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was exciting, interesting, and had me to where I could not put it down. When I finished the book I imediately had to get the next book in the trilogy because I absolutely had to know what would happen next. Very visual writing with a flare for the dramatic. When I read this book it was like watching a movie.
0439023513|3.0|The first two thirds of the book was what I had hoped it would be--exciting, suspenseful, and emotional. The last third got a little sloppy. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll try to be vague about some things. The plot and action deliver the punch that Suzanne Collins intends. Whether you like the way it ends or not, I think she did a good job with making it believable. Everything that happened was set up from the beginning. Every character met their mark and every major event sprung emotion in me.<br /><br />It was her writing that detracted. I feel like she got tired after about 200 or so pages. She was dragging things out that didn't need to be dragged out--too many pages dedicated to sitting in a room. Somewhere along the way it seemed that she was filling in gore for the sake of gore. She could have trimmed back a little and still gotten her point across.<br /><br />Then she started running out of room and energy and spent one chapter summing up the end. With as little space that she allotted to the characters in that last bit, she might as well have just dedicated a paragraph to each, summing up their life. That's what made the ending disappointing--not who Katniss ended up with or what happened to the rest--just the fact that Collins decided that a trilogy of a love triangle can be rectified in the last 4 or so pages. It's so abrupt that there's no time for any kind of emotional satisfaction before the book is closed. This made it the most anti-climatic ending that I can think of.<br /><br />But what made me skip several pages were the dream sequences. I have an ongoing issue with dream sequences in any book--namely, I don't care about them. There may be an instance or two where it directly effects the plot, but for the life of me I can't think of such an example. Most of the time they serve only as foreshadowing or allegory. Both of which, can be a massive waste of time. Here is the point that I'm sure Collins was trying to get across with the dreams: Katniss is psychologically scarred by her past. She has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and it wont go away. I got that the first time she woke up screaming. If you want to keep reminding the audience then tell us again about her waking up screaming. But none of us need to read the details of her dreams. Even the scariest ones are boring because they're not true action. They're just filler.<br /><br />One more thing, and this may count as a spoiler, so let that be a warning: SPOILER BELOW.<br /><br />What the hell was with the pearl? She drags that thing through 2 books and then it disappears without doing a damned thing! She could have done so much with that...or ANYTHING with that. But no. It's just left as some kind of symbolic image--like the useless paragraphs of dreams. If you're going to keep bringing it up--make it worth it to the reader. And I don't mean symbolism; I mean something tangible. With all the other symbolic images flying around, it was about time to turn one into a tool for the plot.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|this show was so good and the dvd is great too I am glad to have show's like this the stuff they have today is not very good
B001NLKT60|5.0|The book starts out a bit slow, but I couldn't put it down after a while. The main character Lisbeth Salander becomes the prime suspect in a triple homicide investigation, although she is also a victim of violent crime.  Once you finish this book, you'll want to start the third one for sure!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" is awesome, because once you finish the \\"Hunger Games\\" you can move on to the next book in the trilogy without trying to find it.  And why buy it seperately anyway when you can get it all at once.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Fantastic album...I love every song on this album. I hope that the music industry does not make Gotye a one hit wonder with Somebody because his entire album is just plain amazing. He is incredibly talented and all of his music deserves to be heard. I suggest you take a listen to the album. When I'm having a bad day, there are songs on here that just wipe the bad away.. This sits in my cd player in my car, it has been in there for months. I haven't found anything to replace it yet...I haven't enjoyed an full album like this in a very long time. I also saw him live in Boston, and he is talented...and sounds just as amazing live, showing he has true artistic talent, and that his music and voice isn't processed in the studio to sound good, he IS good...get it, enjoy it, dance to it, think about his message.....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you can unlock more games as you play. beat the high score and you get even more points. pretty simple format.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|What!? I haven't even downloaded the app, because every time I try this FREE app tells me I need to input a credit card. No thanks.
B000002L9M|5.0|This album is a classic. Black Celebration, Here is the House and Stripped are the best songs on the album. The lyrics are deep and this is the best synth dance pop around.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I have read most of Mr. Balducci's previous books and generally liked them a lot. This book was strange in that it is pure formulaic action with little substance. The two main characters are tossed around from one scenario to another so we can watch how they barely survive and then outrun or outsmart the enemy. It must have been written for hollywood to produce directly as one can see a Jason Statham type in the lead role. I was a typical formula and could be predicted just about every step of the way. An old formula with little depth. I can't recommend it
B0014DQSG2|5.0|I love Amanda Bynes AND Colin Firth, and both are amazing in this film. Yes, it is kind of cheesy and you can probably guess what happens, but the story is so cute and the acting is so good that you can watch this happy ending again and again. I know I do.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I've been using this app for years on a number of phones and its been a huge help in staying organized.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I do not like the ads on the new version. Magnet Racer Arcade is much better. At least their ads are not overbearing.
B001I45UFC|5.0|this is a great book for kids. There is a lot of action and adventure to this book. C. S. Lewis is a great author!  :D
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read this book out of curiosity - it seems to be the buzz these days.  Everybody is talking about it.  It got me hooked and read all 3 books.  I wanted to know how this couple would evolve.  At first it was a little surprising (almost shocking sex scenes), but then you get used to them - business as usual.  I liked geting to know these two leading characters and watching their lives progress.<br /><br />I wouldn't have guessed the ending of book 3.  Quick reads.  Great beach reads.  Sort of fun.
1451627289|5.0|This is an excellent \\"everyman\\" time-travel story told in first-person, reminiscent of Jack Finney's Time and Again classic.  High school English teacher Jake Epping is maneuvered into traveling to 1958 via a strange portal in order to stop the JFK assassination, which of course is then still 5 years in the future, enough time for all sorts of complications.  Part adventure, part dark thriller, and part love story, 11/22/63 succeeds on all levels and holds the reader's attention with its frequent plot twists.  King's pacing and characterization are pitch perfect.<br /><br />Of course, some of this novel is autobiographical since King worked as an English teacher, and he lived through the 1958-1963 period as a pre-teen and teen (11 to 16 years old).  This background, therefore, helps King provide the \\"feel\\" of that period quite faithfully.<br /><br />I'm a science fiction fan and writer, so horror and the supernatural are not generally to my taste, and so even though I appreciate King's beautiful writing style, I usually avoid most of his work.  Misery is one exception and 11/22/63 is another.  King fans who are looking for flat-out horror (not just some threatening creepiness) will probably be disappointed with 11/22/63, but more mainstream readers and fans of time-travel stories will be very, very satisfied.<br /><br />Vincent Miskell is the author of Godspeed, Inc.:  A Naomi Kinder Adventure (a free ebook for Kindle).<br />[...]
0765316994|4.0|If you didn't love at least one of the Star Trek franchises, this book may not be for you.<br /><br />If you did, well, just buy a copy.<br /><br />The novel follows the adventures of a few bright shiny new ensigns as they start their tours of duty on the flagship of the fleet. Alas, very quickly, they discover that all is not right on the Intrepid. Shiny new ensigns have a habit of dying on away missions at an appalling rate. And the senior staff doesn't seem to notice, much less care. What's a shiny new ensign to do?<br /><br />In an odd way, this book is sort of like a light-hearted version of the 7th season ST:TNG episode 'Lower Decks'. We see the Intrepid not from the perspectives of the senior officers on the bridge, but rather from the perspective of those at the bottom of the food chain. If the young officers in Lower Decks had suddenly gotten dangerously genre-savvy, the analogy would be even better.<br /><br />While the book is fun and fast-paced (i read it in a single sitting), it's also pretty shallow. Character development has no real place in it, which may be because there wasn't time, or may be a nod to the fact that Redshirts don't usually get any. The plot is pretty simple, the only complication coming from the increasingly meta nature of the story. Also, though a stated point of the story (in the ending acknowledgements by the author) is to mock the faux-science used in mediocre sci-fi, one early scene poking fun at it uses bad science of its own (if someone already has an infection, a vaccine won't help them). (Note: i read an Advance Readers' Copy of this book, so there's a chance a later round of editing fixed this silliness.)<br /><br />The worst thing about the whole novel is the codas. They take a light, fun adventure, and try to turn it into something deeper and more meaningful. For me, it very much ruined the tone of the novel, especially given the last chapter. It's like the alternate ending of Clerks ruining the whole movie in retrospect.<br /><br />So if you're proud to call yourself a geek, buy this book. Make some popcorn, clear out a few hours of your schedule, sit, and read. Just stop before the codas. It's better that way.<br /><br />So if you're proud to call yourself a geek, buy this book.

0385493622|5.0|I first came across \\"Fermat's Enigma\\" years ago while completing a Masters degree. I was doing research for a History of Mathematics class when this book grabbed my attention while sitting on the library book shelves. I checked it out, started reading and just found myself totally engrossed in the story, almost from the get go, and finished it in two days.<br /><br />The story of the solving of Fermat's Last Theorem contains almost all of the features that draw us to read books in the first place. What is super-interesting is this: though the story takes place within the mathematics field, it contained elements of fraud, murder, suicide...all in the pursuit of a seemingly elusive proof, based on an equation that, at first glance, seems so simple. And because almost all of us are familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem from our school days, the fact that over 350 years and hundreds of different mathematicians were needed to come up with the elusive answer just makes the story that much more fascinating.<br /><br />I now teach college mathematics and recently, noticed that one of my students was reading \\"Fermat's Enigma.\\" It brought back fond memories and I desired to check it out again from the library to give the book another read. This time, it was not available...so I did what the student did: ordered my own copy from Amazon. It arrived today and I'm excited about having an entire weekend to once again visit the cast of characters and the engrossing saga that evolved over the centuries.<br /><br />Fantastic read! And highly recommended!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Complete and utter junk. Lucas keeps playing with things. By things, I mean dialog and plot. Not things he should be playing with, like fixing the color. I want the full set of theatrical releases, you know the award-winning stuff, not junk like this. Maybe if we don't buy these, he'll come to his senses and give fans what they've been asking for years for - the real artistry of the originals.<br /><br />Where is the \\"zero star\\" option for these reviews???
1466401885|1.0|I mean this strictly as constructive criticism...<br /><br />I couldn't finish this book. It was truly that painful. The characters are underdeveloped and the story plot it seriously lacking. When I read a book I want to be engaged by the characters by the first few chapters or I'm going to put the book down (which is exactly what I did).<br /><br />On a side note, the book is full of grammatical errors (which is a personal peeve of mine). I can overlook one or two, but when it's up in the double digits it just screams amateur.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|this is just about the only Android app I've purchased where I wasn't desperately waiting for something to be fixed in the 'next' release. Complete replacement for stock calendar, plus everything that anyone who relies on their calendar would want to have. Job well done.

B0074JOCIG|5.0|A truly brilliant registration of a great concert. Excellent, transparant HD audio mix. Turns my home cinema theatre into a live concert venue.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Love the game but waaaaaaay too choppy towards the end. would give a 5 otherwise. Very possible to get through without having to buy glu credits - major plus for that.
0316098329|4.0|This book/story disturbed me far more than it entertained me, but considering the subject matter, I'm sure my opinion is not unique. Narration by a five-year-old is a tough perspective from which to write, I'm sure, but kudos to Emma Donoghue for pulling it off. This child's precocious nature and vocabulary is ultimately explained, perhaps even justified, but I still didn't find the whole story believable, and I'm not sure why I read it other than it was a book club suggestion.<br /><br />Months after reading this book, I will say the story has stayed with me. Each time I read or hear about an abduction case in the news, I can't help but envision this tiny room, so clearly defined in the story, and contemplate what this type of captivity does to the victims.<br /><br />Powerful work.
1475268378|5.0|August Macke's innovative illustrations serve as a counter-point to the prevailing mood of \\"To the Lighthouse\\", the never explicitly mentioned but sensed background of World War I. Macke, one of the foremost members of the German Expressionist group known as Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), was killed in the early days of the war, in 1914, when he was only 27, cutting short the career of this extraordinary avant-garde artist
0345529057|2.0|I have read a number of similar books and would say this book has a great setting, backdrop, premise, and it starts off with great characters. Without giving things away I would say there are LOTS of characters who get introduced....wander around...the \\"go away\\" without really doing much.  Other books like this can have to much drama and epic battles without character development or story telling.  This one goes way to far the other direction.  After finshing the 4th book I was really frustrated at how little had been resolved and wait...there is a next book<br />I don't shy away from length but this one was not worth all the time which disapointed me after such a great start.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this (along with temple run and jetpack joyride) i have waited forever for! it would be worth $3.00! I love miniclip!!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|this game is a wonderful, addicting game. although it isn't free. amazon should make a free version . if you have an apple phone,pad,or computer I regimends this game to the people who don't wont to pay for a simple game.

In fact I'm going to buy a second \\"Game of Thrones\\" season one for my brother.

I can get details on local weather for the next 24 hours, and basic info in a fourteen-day forecast. It does what I wanted.Choices on the bottom task bar are: detailed local weather, 14-day forecast (touching the current day opens into a page-by page detailed screen for the next 14 days, one page for each day), weather radar picture, videos of weather reports, and a menu to select weather news, favorites, locations, and program settings.
1451627289|5.0|Of course not.I loved it,read it straight through.Be prepared to put your life on hold til you finish it.Filled with nostalgic facts about some aspects of life in the late 50's and 60's.
0345803485|1.0|This was a selection for my book club and this will be the first one that I cannot finish. It's simply terrible, boring and not even sexy. I'm no prude but I cannot for the life of me understand how this poorly written nonsense could get anyone turned on. The writing is so clumsy that I was amused more than aroused!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This collection has both my and my son's approval.  It is the complete package that makes this so great.  The video quality was awesome on my new Samsung LED TV.  We absolutely loved the disc with all the spoofs.  We'd worn out our DVDs of the saga a while back so having this beats catching a Spike TV marathon any day.
1416972250|5.0|Wow! This book was leaps and bounds better than the first two. The first book was just sort of 'eh' for me, but I did press on and get book 2 - which was better, my interest was piqued and by the end of that one, I had to get book 3. This one was by far the best - \\"I couldn't put it down\\" is a good description. As usual, Clare and her overuse of metaphors are sprinkled throughout this book but its just her writing style and I'm starting to get used to it. I loved the ending of this one and honestly - Clare could have probably ended the series on this one but alas, I see there is a 4th and 5th book so I'll be getting those. I am so loving Simon and of course Clary/Jace's dynamics now that everything is out in the open with them. I hear there's a wedding in book 4, looking forward to it!<br /><br />Five stars!

B007V2UGPE|5.0|its more than to be expected from a good free game. personally I haven't had any problems yet. and I am enjoying the game. It gets very difficult after awhile of course encouraging you to actually purchase coins for upgrades. Ive had it for awhile and my kids like it as well, its easy to play as well as very fun.
B006HGXGWU|1.0|I borrowed this from the library, so at least I didn't pay for it. Still, by the time it was over, I was angry because I wasted a couple of hours watching it. Slow, you don't know the meaning of slow till you see this exploration of mental illness.<br /><br />I'm not a movie fan who likes to see incessant car chases - and crashes - or people impossibly outrunning explosions, but this movie was so slow I had to speed it up at various points, else I would have thrown the remote at the TV. I admit that the actors who played the protagonist and his devoted wife did amazing jobs, especially with the sorry excuse for a story they had to work with, but good acting alone was not enough to save this flick. I recognize that many people seem to drool over it, but I'm not one of them. And the ending? Curtis and his wife, gazing in rapt attention at what?  Storm clouds, you say? Wow. I thought maybe an asteroid might be approaching, or the sun going nova, or UFOs might be landing, but no, gee, there were these big grey storm clouds, and I was totally underwhelmed.<br /><br />If you like to sit in a lawn chair and watch the grass grow, you might enjoy this flick.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I enjoy disaster movies but oh no not this one....complete and total FAIL!!! BOOO!!!<br />Only real good thing about this movie was the effects. It was too long it felt like half of it could have been eliminated. In fact I couldn't even finish the movie and I don't care. I doubt that whatever I missed would have made what I did watch, worth it!! Usually when I don't finish a movie or a book it bugs me that I have to eventually complete it but I don't at all feel this way in this case. What was about with John Cusack's character, he's a good actor but was his role supposed to annoy the crap out of you? He had annoyed me lol. Danny Glover is always good it seems in whatever his role is. The rest of the cast, dialogue, script was bad. UGH!
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|What am I suppose to write it was a good movie ,My daugther loved this movie she is 12 she is the one who wanted wanted this Smurf movie ,she seen it at the movies with her grandma.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|loved all 3 books! and pleased that the 3rd was different, as the characters HAD to be different with all they had been through. a few surprises and twists in the plot.  just ENJOY it for what it is: FICTION!
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie from the exciting and well done plane crash to the final scene.<br /><br />Locations were great and the story of survival was well carried out.<br /><br />All in all an exciting adventure romp well worth a viewing.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I RARELY, if ever, hand out five stars to movies. But this movie was far deserving of it. A great adaptation of the superb series by Suzanne Collins. Obviously some things have to be left out, as all novels to film go, but they did a wonderful job regardless. I do however understand, that if you have not read/or you did not enjoy the books, that you probably will not enjoy the film as much as an avid fan like myself.<br /><br />Even critics (not that I take their opinion into consideration) who hate all the good movies, gave it a good review. It was refreshing to see an excellent and extremely unique movie for a change, with all the static of junk movies out there. I only have one negative thing to say, the camera work was extremely jumpy(either due to style, an attempt to tame the violence, or both) The actors for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale were perfect.<br /><br />Prepare for; violence in a fight to survive, the effects of war on children and their families, valor and heart, a bit of romance, maybe a few tears, and struggles from the oppression of a totalitarian Government. I can't wait to see the other movies in the trilogy. This is a must see! You don't have to own it as I will, but I would watch it at least once to form your own opinion. Know this- It is a sensation for a reason. Even if it wasn't their favorite movie, I have yet to meet a single person that has regretted watching it. Maybe you too, will be left hungering for more!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this a great game for children and adults lots of fun no matter the age would recomend it for all
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book is an eye opening story of survival under some of the most cruel and dehumanizing conditions. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about North Korea.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is so Funn!!! I love watching other people draw something for me and I love drawing stuff for others!!
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I don't write reviews, I just read them - shame on me - this is an interactive process.  Anyway, I was so impressed by the value of this set that I just had to weigh in. I am probably one of a handful of people that actually purchased these disks new (in vinyl of course) in the 60's. They were impressive then, and still are. I have been buying music in all formats for all of these 50+ years, so I know value when I see it.  You cannot beat this set.  There is so much great music (and sound) here.  For 2 bucks a disk - give me a break. I do want to speak about the sound.  These recordings were done with a single pair of microphones.  You do not get all of the close-up detail that you get with multiple microphone methods. But what you do get is a very natural concert ambiance.  And don't under-estimate the impact here. These were demo-quality recordings when new, and they still have the power to impress.  You may want to back off the volume on the Civil War band disks so as not to blow out a speaker - that is the kind of low end power that is here. But this is just not about technical wizzardry. There is a lot of wonderful music here. By all means, look at the contents. If you don't see items there that interest you, don't buy it. But if you see anything that might be of interest, do not hesitate. This is a great set and you will not be disappointed. My recommendation is just BUY IT while it is available.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I absolutely love books by Sylvia Day, Bared to You was no exception! A great read and I'm pretty picky about my books. In order to receive five stars, a book needs to have emotional intensity, a great story and interesting characters. This book had it all. Bravo Ms. day!
B00371V6SE|5.0|Difficult to put this book down once you are into the<br />feeling of the characters.  Another great read from<br />Nicloas Sparks.  I enjoyed getting to know his characters<br />as always they feel friends.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|the books were great. Really enjoyed reading them,they're not longtook me about 3 days to read them all. It's off course betterthen the movie and they were quite rich and pleasant to read
0345803485|1.0|I got this book because of all the hype. I wish I hadn't. The first chapter was interesting, but everything after that was basically a repeat of that chapter. It was terribly written, I could do better when I was high school. She uses the same combinations of words over and over and over- this will catch your attention and drive you crazy. Randomly she would use these ridiculous words that you'll have to look up (if you actually care by that point). And it ends abruptly so if you want to know what happens you have to buy the next books.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I forced myself to read the last book just to know what the heck happens. But honestly, I just about threw my kindle in the dumpster. Amazon can do way better than puting junk writers on there website saying &#34;oh Ana!&#34;, &#34;stop biting you lip&#34;, and references to her &#34;inner godess&#34; every 5 seconds. All in all James needs to go back to England. and I need to stop buying books just because I see it on the Today Show(:
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best, most intense, MUST READS, I have come across in a long time.  It is a page turner and keeps getting better.  I would recommend even people who are not into this type of thing to give it a chance, you will not be disappointed.
B007V9YF5E|2.0|Crappy plot. Horrible acting.I can't say that I had high hopes for this flick, but man...Alan Smithee wouldn't put his name on this crap.<br /><br />I was excited when I saw the all-star cast, but the excitement ended there. If I had to choose a highlight it would be the uber realistic fight scenes. Gina C. definitely made up for some horrid acting with some kick ass ass kicking.<br /><br />If you're like me you'll probably watch this regardless of the bad review, but trust me...your time will be better spent planking.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I was not overly impressed with this series, but of the three, I think this was the best. The writing is still weak, but at least the characters seem a bit more developed and the plot more interesting.

B0071T3Q9K|1.0|You have to be a true blue Paul fan to listen to this more than once. I grew up with his great voice, but like my own voice, his has degressed also. Try again Paul, but rock and roll fits your voice now.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I did not want to go to the theater to see this but I did for my kid. I was really surprised by how good it was. Did you know it is a musical?? Yep! Fun songs, lots of color, a great story, laugh out loud moments, and it has a great moral to the story. I look forward to buying this movie when it comes out. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with or without a kid. FUN MOVIE
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the game was very entertaining when bored and cant sleep.  the game has good graphics and funny characters.  It has simple controls for easy use and game playing. It makes time fly when you play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is amazing and very easy to use. Its like a real Bible with an easy to use reference bar that lets you look up verses quick. I also love devotional options they have. You can pick any plan that suits your needs. I highly recommend this app.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Today, 10 seconds after I realized my phone was missing, a man came rushing up to me out of breath saying, \\"You dropped this in the middle of 7th Ave (NYC) and it was ran over TWICE!!  I hope it works!\\" There's not a scratch on my phone!  Seriously, best phone cover ever, except that now it has a yellow tint, but for $8, I'm buying a few at a time.  Can I say again, IT PROTECTED MY PHONE FROM NYC TRAFFIC!!!  There's nothing more to say!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|There are far too many reviews for me to write a long description of what was right and what was wrong with this book. Also, I will not be rehashing the story. In a nutshell, I really liked the book. It was interesting to read a first person account of a how a white female managed to get herself incarcerated and her experiences with both the judicial system and her fellow inmates. The book was well written and edited. Because Ms. Kerman is an appealing character, I was disappointed not to find out more about her post-incarceration experiences while segueing back into society.<br /><br />The book was entertaining and was obviously not intended to be an exposé on the prison system: it is what you would expect to hear about after a close friend has imbibed a couple of martinis...if she hadn't always been such a good girl.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|this book was simply amazing i read it all in one day because it was so good everyone should read it i cant wait to see the movie now
0743277465|4.0|There are some serious flaws with the book and some good points a customer should consider before buying:<br /><br />The most serious flaw is the somewhat misleading title. The author surprisingly doesn't give a lot of clear pointers on how to learn. If anyone is qualified to teach learning, it's Mr. Waitzkin. And he's fairly personable, so he should be able to communicate advice better than he does in this book. The real advice he gives could definitely could be clarified and condensed. I hope the author has identified this weakness and is working on it - I suspect he has given that he's in that arena now.<br /><br />The second most nagging flaw is the vindictive tone that keeps recurring. He really gets harsh digs in and he names names. The story of his chess youth rehashes a lot of the one dimensional villain characters from the movie SFBF which I'd hoped were simply an insensitive plot device. A famous and respected chess instructor is also trashed on both a personal and professional level. I found a dig at an old philosophy professor nasty - accusing him of 'narcissistic academic literalism' when he questioned the author's cherished sacred cow 'intuition'. But that's what philosophy professors do since Wittgenstein - it's their job to help clarify vague language! The author should have recognized this challenge as legitimate and non-trivial.<br /><br />Which brings to mind the last major flaw: the storytelling itself is relatively narcissistic. Without intending to do so, the author in very florid detail promotes himself as deep and artistic. He also seems very eager to spin competitive problems he has experienced, and this reader was left with the impression that he is so tormented by some past defeats that he can't accept them as just that and nothing more.<br /><br />The main strength of the book is that it does give some useful advice! He gives tips such as focusing on simple skills rather than fancy ones, how to make injuries and setbacks as opportunities,how to get in a zone, how to be resilient, etc. I take him at his word since he clearly would have excelled in any competitive endeavor that caught his imagination. And the book was a pretty fun read. Despite my rough criticisms above, I find the author quite likeable. We all have our faults, and he's a good guy who really has the potential to help a lot of people if he can work on mastering this new art.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought it and it's worth reading if you are involved in competitive endeavors that require determination. There is some real food for thought, and that's why I give it 4 stars despite all my reservations - you only need to learn one or two useful tips to make it worth the money! I'm not sure he ever succeeds in demonstrating that he simply isn't talented. Many of us have great willpower, intuition, and creativity. But practice as we may, we don't rise to the top of the pack. I consider him a demonstrated master of two fields who needs to work more yet on the art of teaching.
B004ZZLX5W|4.0|Though not as good as their first LP, Funeral, overall a very enjoyable album.  The two extra songs on this deluxe edition are quite good and the short film by Jonze stands out.  Packaging design is gorgeous.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|For a fairly good cast of actors, this should have been a good movie. It was low budget, poor story line, and mostly disappointing.
B0000640VM|3.0|This movie was produced in the late 1980's, which many consider to be the era of less-than-stellar Disney features.  While I enjoyed the premise (Oliver Twist with cats & dogs in modern-day Manhattan), the story, the voice casting and the wonderful, upbeat songs (Huey Lewis, Billy Joel, Bette Midler), for me the animation really fell flat.  It looked like mass-produced late 1970's Saturday morning cartoon fare.  Disney classics such as Bambi, Dumbo, and Lady & the Tramp all feature animals drawn with an amazing, almost human expressiveness in their countenance.  Sadly I thought this film fell short of Disney's usual high standard.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those fast-paced books that makes you stay up way too late because you can't put it down (I haven't burned through a book this fast since the DaVinci Code).  It's a unique story idea with likable characters.  I bought all 3 books at once because I had a feeling I'd want to read them all at once, and I was right - I would've hated to have had to wait even a couple of days in between!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the scratch movies and the game is an entertaining time killer<br />fun for me or the kids<br />causes some force closes though

B004RPN100|4.0|Hiroshima is a surprisingly simple piece of John that talks of six seemingly ordinary people who survived the atomic bomb in Hiroshima.  It starts on the morning the bomb was dropped, when they were going about their normal lives, and ends several months later as they struggle to piece their destroyed lives and bodies back together.<br />The lives of six of those survivors are retold in the days following the bombing. When the bomb hits, the first of the survivors Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura is watching her neighbor's house and overseeing her sleeping children; they all end up covered in debris when their house is destroyed. Miss Toshiko Sasaki, an office clerk, is leaning over to speak to a fellow worker when she is blasted out of her desk and trapped under heavy a bookcase; which later causes her to break her leg because she couldn't free herself out.  In another case a medical doctor, Masakazu Fujii, is reading on his porch when he is thrown into a river and squeezed between two large timbers.  Terufumi Sasaki, another doctor, falls to the floor in the corridor of the Red Cross Hospital and gazes in wonder at the scene outside the window. Which at the time everything is silent and covered in debris. Meanwhile Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge awakens in the vegetable garden of the Catholic mission house, injured and dazed. Finally the noble Kiyoshi Tanimoto throws himself between the wall and his desk back at his house. In the hours following the bombing, each survivor attempts to free himself or herself, find loved ones. Most of the six survivors are hurt, but they are all alive. During the evening of August 6, the survivors struggle to endure and help each other. The city is a ball of flame, and the park is filled with radiation rain and whirlwinds. The suffering of thousands of people and their wounds and burns are described repeatedly. With such strong words that when I read this story I felt that I was there experiencing Hiroshima myself.<br />I really felt that this bookcaptured not only my attention but Americas because it is a clear understood book that explains in simple word what happened August 6 1945 and with such vivid details. Well like the cover says \\"Anyone that knows how to read should read it.\\"<br />By: Dhamar Herrera

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games begins on the day of the reaping in District 12. 16 year old, Katniss Everdeen, sets out to meet her friend Gale so they can do some hunting and gathering before the reaping that afternoon. As Katniss makes her way from her home to the Meadow. Where people of the district are forbidden to go. She thinks about her sister Prim, who is 4 years younger, and her mother, both of whom have depended upon her for survival ever since Katniss' father died in a mine explosion when she was 11. Two tributes are drawn in each of the 12 districts, and those tributes are sent to an arena where they fight until only one tribute remains alive. The one who survives  gets to return home, and the victor's district gets gifts and mainly food.  The Games, put on by the Capitol, are meant to punish the 12 districts of Panem as well as to remind them of the Dark Days and how the 13th district was obliterated for its uprising against the tyrannical and cruel Capitol.<br /><br />Against all odds, Prim's name is selected at the reaping. Katniss panics and volunteers to take the place of her younger sister and becomes District 12's girl tribute for the 74th Hunger Games.  Peeta Mellark, a boy Katniss' age and the son of the baker, is selected as the other tribute. Before she leaves, Katniss says goodbye to her mother and Prim; to Madge, the mayor's daughter who gives her the mockingjay pin. On the train, Katniss experiences luxury  and gets to eat the richest, most decadent food. They both get to know Effie Trinket, their escort, and Haymitch Abernathy. After they arrive at the Training Center, Katniss and Peeta meet their stylists, pleasantly surprised when she meets Cinna, a young man who dresses simply and wears very little makeup compared with the other stylists.  They race through the Capitol in a chariot holding hands, their outfits blazing in fake flames, earning Katniss her nickname \\"girl on fire.\\" Their entrance becomes the highlight of the opening ceremonies.<br /><br/>After the ceremonies, the tributes begin their training. Haymitch coaches Katniss and Peeta together, per their request, and instructs them to keep their biggest strengths a secret from the other tributes. After many years of hunting game in the woods, her prowess with the bow and arrow are unrivaled. They are to appear inseparable, which, as the training goes on, becomes increasingly tiring for Katniss, who can't decide whether Peeta's kindness and compliments are genuine or simply a part of a scheme for winning the Games.<br /><br />The 74th Hunger Games begin with the tributes rising up from below ground.They stand in a circle around the metal Cornucopia, a giant golden horn that holds supplies and weapons, meant to lure the tributes in for a bloodbath. Haymitch has instructed Katniss not to run toward the Cornucopia, but to run as far away as she can and find water immediately. That first night, while sleeping in a tree, she sees that the Careers, the tributes from the wealthier districts, have formed an alliance and are hunting the weakest tributes together. She is shocked to see that Peeta is a part of their group and decides that she can't trust him after all, that he distracted her at the Cornucopia on purpose, and that he has been misleading her all along.<br /><br />With just six tributes remaining, including Katniss and Peeta, Claudius Templesmith, the Games' announcer, declares a new rule to the Games. This year, two tributes can win so long as they come from the same district. Katniss immediately sets out to find Peeta, whom she knows has been injured badly by Cato.Katniss and Peeta believe the Games are over, but then Claudius Templesmith's voice announces that the new rule that was previously established about two tributes winning has been revoked. Only one tribute can win. Katniss realizes this has been the Gamemakers' plan all along, to end with the star-crossed lovers and watch one of them sacrifice his or her life for the other. She and Peeta both prepare to eat poisonous berries, which makes Claudius take back his most recent announcement, stating that two tributes can indeed win, declaring Katniss and Peeta as this year's Hunger Games winners.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the second book in the Hunger Game Sequels if the first book was too much to handle the second book will be a roller coaster ride.  Katniss was a young girl from district 12, she although young has just survived the test of a lifetime, she participated and survived the 74th annual Hunger Games with her partner Peeta. She volunteered as tribute and endured the journey. Now she is back to District 12 and is living in Victor Village with her mother and sister. Even though she has won and should be happy to be alive, she is surrounded by problems. Her love life is a mess and her social life has just taken a huge twist not only is she now the face of the rebellion of the capitol now she must be careful and cautious with every word or action she takes. Katniss struggles and as a reader we can help but feel her frustration and worry. The author makes it clear that Katniss is a threat to the capitol and President Snow makes sure that Katniss should just stay out of it. Tension begin to soar and by the time the 75th annual Hunger Games come the \\"traditional games\\" have taken a very surprising twist, as a reader your heart falls and you can assume where this is going to end, but sure enough we can only begin to imagine. Although a fictional tale, the vivid details help you imagine the horror felt when Katniss is choosen and the female tribute and Peeta volunteers and we can only imagine the reason behind his sacrifice is to try to protect Katniss the woman he loves, but she cannot. The on screen romance was nothing but a very effective way of survival. Katniss prepares for the games making allies and studying the game, the games begin and nothing is certain only that every player should expect the unexpected. The games begin and everyone must survive or be killed, you can feel Peetas frustration as he gets hurt and becomes same what of a burden. The Games are changed the rules are broken nothing is traditional any longer everything was a plan, from the beginning, what Katniss believed is all wrong and it all becomes worst with a surprising announcement from Gale, a heart ranching ending is what the reader must endure as you turn the pages.ing, what Katniss believed is all wrong and it all becomes worst with a surprising announcement from Gale, a heart ranching ending is what the reader must endure as you turn the pages.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|...CLEARLY any soccer mom with a laptop, a word-of-the-day calendar, and the ability to copy and paste can get a book published!<br />So I caved and purchased the final book in this trilogy (even though I didn't expect much) because I have this thing with finality. Wanted to have everything wrapped up in my mind. And I'll admit, I was pleasantly surprised...after I got to almost the end! The redundancy in the first 75% of this book was unbelievable! It went something like this:<br />Ana and Christian email. Then they fight. Then Christian punishes Ana with sexual teasing and she begs, \\"Please...\\"  Then they have sex and \\"find their release\\" at exactly the same time (Really?). Next they wake up entangled in each others limbs and proceed with, \\"Good morning, Mrs. Grey...Good morning, Mr. Grey...\\" After that, Christian insists that Ana eat. Then they're driven to work in the Audi and proceed to email back and forth, thus starting the process over again.<br />I swear the author copied and pasted the same three scenes a hundred times in this book! And when I wasn't reading a repeat of the previous chapter, I was reading emails between the two main characters. Who emails back and forth like that anyway? The book is set in 2011. Everyone and their dog uses text messaging! Yet these two are emailing every three minutes...with a new subject line and accompanying signature EVERY time. Who does that? Maybe I'm out of the loop.<br />My other big gripe with this book was the same as many other reviewers: the constant reminder of how hot Christian Grey is. Apparently this man is so beautiful that every woman on the planet stares and blushes when he enters a room. And Jekyll and Hyde Ana vacillates between \\"What did I do to deserve this god\\" and \\"Back off! He's mine sister!\\" Please pick a personality and stick with it (although her hubby has about 5 personalities himself). And while I'm on the subject of beautiful people, I have to say that  I find it so unbelievable that EVERY man this girl comes in contact with is crazy about her as her husband points out every time she interacts with someone of the opposite sex. The author has done a poor job of painting a picture of some hot bombshell that every man wants. She's painted the picture of a beautiful jaw dropper perfectly for the best friend but not Ana. From what I've read, I imagine a cute brunette at best. It just wasn't believable for me.<br />The book did pick up near the end when some action (other than sex) took place. As a matter of fact, the last 25% of the book had the least amount of sex and I enjoyed it the most. Maybe because I wasn't subjected to the same over zealous sex scenes every two pages (I think the author had a porn movie on repeat when she wrote those scenes). Overall, the end of the book was more action packed and overall better than the beginning and middle...with the exception of one line in the epilogue. After our two sex addicted main characters have finished doing it while pregnant, Ana makes the statement (about her unborn daughter), \\"I think she likes sex already.\\" WTH? Okay, I have yet to have children. But I can't see myself EVER saying those words about my child! It seemed soooooo inappropriate!<br />If I could rate the book in sections, the first 3/4 gets a solid F! But I'd give the last 1/4 a C+. Have to count off for references to unborn children in adult situations! If you insist on reading the book, you could effectively read the first two chapters and then skip to chapter twenty for the good stuff. I promise, you won't be missing anything!
B000XR4OC0|1.0|I ordered these shoes because I wanted a pair of slip-on light weight shoes. My granddaughter said get TOMS. I ordered a blue pair in size 6.5 for myself and pink in a size 7 for her. The blue pair arrived first and the pink a couple of days later. When I tried on the blue I was disappointed. The shoes were too flat and the arch was barely there. And when I walked my feet came out the shoes. I was going to return them but my granddaughter swears the 6.5 fit. So I gave them to her. I also read the reviews before I ordered.  It wasn't until the pink pair arrived That I realized they weren't TOMS. To me the insoles seem softer than the TOMS. I will stick with Easy Spirit.
0345803485|1.0|I can only give Fifty Shades of Grey one star. And that star is for the marketing genius who managed to get enough hype going to sell this book.

B007UXSPK2|4.0|MI4 is a full-on rollercoaster ride for anyone who is a spy-junkie. The movie is nicely loaded up with plenty of action scenes, from fist fights to car chases. There's also plenty of cool gadgets from the climbing gloves to the mobile command center to the spymobile with the data windshield. Espionage... Intrigue... Good stuff. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise the person, but his characters always deliver. Ethan Hunt is a super-spy, always thinking on his feet and inspiring his team to push beyond their limitations. From Russia to Dubai, the scope and adrenaline will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This is an excellent music track that I really enjoyed. Britney draws the line between pop music and hardcore dance that really shows why she is among the most popular artists of the times. This album sold 1.3 million copies in its first week alone.<br /><br />The tracks were penned by Max Martin. You may remember him from Backstreet Boys. He knows what he's doing! You'll hear classic sounds in this, from Iggy Pop, to ABBA, to Rolling Stones - Britney brings them all together in a musical panapoly.<br /><br />'Oops! I Did It Again' - this is very similar to 'Baby One More Time' but exceeds the soundtrack in that regard. The chorus is fantastic and the song escalates towards the middle into a fantastic crescendo.<br /><br />'Stronger' is a very machined sounding track with a heavy beat.<br /><br />'Dont Let Me Be The Last To Know' has that classic cocktail room background music tone that you hear playing in a dusky bar somewhere.<br /><br />'Lucky' is that quintessential teenage angst song that makes you want to cry as you reminisce about the old days.<br /><br />This is very age appropriate muzak. This is a snap-your-fingers, shake your head, and dance to the sweet ballads and jam stylings of Britney Spears. She demands your attention, wants satisfaction, and does it all!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game!! I have played it on my phone but never on my Kindle Fire. It is a great game to have and its free! I wanted this game forever and now it iis finally here!!! I recommend this game to all ages. I cant wait to go and play it again.
B004X8W468|5.0|This was a wonderful book, and not only because of its interesting plot, but because of all the small subtle things the author has in this book that make it truly wonderful. For instance, the subtle way in which the protagonist realizes she hasn't always been a nice person. Since she hadn't especially been a horrible person the reader doesn't necessarily pick up on this (or at least I didn't. Maybe I'm just a mean person) until she starts thinking about things and how she treats people.  It was also wonderful to read how Miranda becomes aware of her financial situation and how it compares to the more wealthy kids she knows, and how that subtly influenced her opinions and the way she thinks about things. I enjoy Madelaine L'Engle and A Wrinkle in Time, and I thought this book certainly followed in the footsteps of Madelaine L'Engle. However, I also felt that this book also had more depth, meaning, and emotional value than A Wrinkle in Time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really enjoy this game...its cute and I'm hooked<br />I'm glad the charactors are the exact ones from the movie....neat scenes too
B006ICOK00|1.0|I bought this version to be able use the view finder to line up my time lapse videos. It stays on for about 5 seconds then goes off. You have to restart the camera to get it to come back up. Quite the pain. The viewfinder resolution is average to say the least and roughly the size of a 1990 digital camera. It does what it says resolution wise and if you're looking for an extremely low quality video for web use I guess this is worth the $200 price tag??? However I purchased a $1.99 app for my iPhone, achieved better results at HD quality with a ton more options. I would not recommend this to anyone.

B007Z9RAX4|4.0|Don't listen to the naysayers. The fight scenes were well done. Carrano is SOOOOO much better and more importantly BELIEVABLE than the likes of Jolie or Saldana or any of the myriad of 100 pound stick thin women that Hollywood tries to sell as action stars.<br /><br />Seriously did anyone or could anyone actually believe all 100 pounds of Jolie beating up anyone let alone 6'4\\" 230 pound guys? Carrano has the physicality and skill to make it believable. This was her first movie which was also the first action movie for the director. As a first timer she was great. Much better than many other first timers and better than nearly all athletes turned actors.<br /><br />Sure the movie wasn't great as it was very generic and predictable but it was better than most of the mind numbing drivel that Hollywood has been putting out. So watch the movie for what it is. An introduction to the first real and believable female action star. Hopefully this is the first of many for Gina.
B0063IH60K|3.0|solitaire actually has many different games.  this game is limited &amp; never actually defines the game you are playing.  starts to feel like just one version no matter what you pick

B003V5PPZG|5.0|Linkin Park said it best when they said they didn't want to make a Hybrid Theory 2. A Thousand Suns is what Minutes to Midnight tried to be. The band has definitely evolved. And in a good way, unlike Korn. But this is definitely a sit-at-home-and-listen-to-it-by-yourself album, not just another album that you only listen to in your car. It's good music, just don't expect to headbang.
B0038YWPZS|2.0|Beware!!!!  If you are a 'Dirty Dancing' fan you will realize this edition has some scenes that are missing from the original movie.  I'm extremely disappointed in this DVD.  I tried to find the edition that had all the scenes, knowing there was one like this out there.  No one stated in the reviews that the movie had been edited.  I watch this one anyway just because I don't want to take a chance on ordering another one and have the same thing happen again.  I would gladly pay the money for a complete movie, but no one seems to state this in the reviews. Order a different version!!!
0439023513|2.0|I enjoyed the entire series, but--being critical here--the last two books seemed rushed and not very well thought out after the huge success of a very good first book. It seems like the entirety of \\"Mocking Jay\\" is devoted to Katnis feeling sorry for herself, getting injured, waking up in a hospital, and repeating the process. The flow of the story jumps in time in huge segments and an entire civil war unfolds itself in about a hundred pages. This series should have been at least five books, because it just felt rushed.<br /><br />The ending was also absolute garbage. She fights her way through a hostile city, losing men as she goes, and when she gets to the end: well looky there, her army made it there before her anyways. Then her sister is just randomly killed, there is no truly great confrontation and final battle with President Snow--whom was meticulously worked up as a greater and greater villain--and she gets injured...again. Then the epilogue explains just willy nilly that she chose Peeta, cause she needed him to complete her. That just came out of left field, the love triangle was one of the biggest drawings of the series and she just ended that arc without any truly memorable scene. The ending was bad, just bad.<br /><br />I enjoyed the books--I did--but \\"Mockingjay\\" has the classic feel of a writer chasing her own success and put under horrible deadlines. Would I recommend this books as a standalone? Definitely not. Would I still recommend someone reading the trilogy? Yes, as bad as this book was, it couldn't ruin the first book.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I could not put this down and stayed up until 1:30 in the morning, knowing I had to get up early for work in a couple of short hours. I have enjoyed all of Kinsellas books, they make me laugh & cry within moments of each other. A good read!!

1594744475|4.0|My toddler is starting to be picky with her food and this book comes in handy with fun ideas and simple recipes. As a busy working mom, it is easy to run out of ideas when preparing food everyday for a picky child. It's a good informative book, comes with easy to follow instructions and pictures.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game has many levels of hidden objects and is well constructed and the objects are well defined. Although, the makers of this program made one error on the objects. On a couple of levels it lists a flute as one of the items to find. There is only a clarinet on the levels and you must click on it to clear the flute off the list.  I am a big fan of hidden object games of the Big Fish variety that I use on my computer.  So,  I was glad to see this type available for my Kindle Fire.  I had no problems playing this game on my Fire and the pinch and zoom worked well when looking for items. It did get a little repetitive on the levels as the scenarios were basically the same, but overall I enjoyed the game. I bought the game at the $2.49 price. I will be buying more from this company in the future.
0061906220|5.0|And I also love this book! At my school, the third graders dramatized it for one of the songs in their spring musical. It was the highlight of the performance! Half a dozen kids, decked out with ears and tails, played Pete the Cat in his various hues of shoes and delivered their \\"groovy\\" lines with no inhibitions. Another half dozen kids took over the calls, and the rest of the group did the reponse. Their enthusiasm throughout was terrific. And I went home and sang it to my own cat, who looks a little like Pete, but without the shoes.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book starts out really slow. I found myself very bored during the first 40 or so pages. After I got past it though I was hooked. I knew this book would be about a war so I really wasn't expecting a happy ending. I won't say if it does or not, so the ending isn't spoiled for people who haven't read it yet. My only complaint would be that all the really good stuff, like the fighting, doesn't happen till the last few chapters. Kind of disappointing.
1442337966|5.0|After listening to this on the CD, I downloaded it on my ipod so I could listen over and over - and I have. I also bought extras to give as gifts. Well formatted to keep your attention yet informative and simple at the same time. The world would be a better place if everyone followed this way of thinking.

B000KZBRG6|2.0|I purchased this item back in February and it had worked great for 2 months. Today, I pulled the meter out to get some light readings and it was non-functional. I purchased new batteries and they did not work as well. For $100.00 dollars, I'd expect this to last at least a year.
1593157134|4.0|Darren has written a book that has taken ideas of financial success and applied them to human behavior. His end of chapter summaries and questions as well as the worksheets are invaluable to applying the principles. I have always had an issue of following through with motivational inspirational reads,  and have fell flat on my face, because i chose not to read and execute. Darren makes you ask the hard questions that if you answer will give you some insight into why you do what you do and what you can do to change it.  Sure you may have heard some of this before, but I believe Darren has put this in a new light and given you tools for succeeding past your previous limits. Darrens final words \\"Motivation without action leads to self-delusion\\"  really hit me hard and made me realize i need to take more action and this book has certainly set me in motion!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a bad book. The writing is poor. And the characters - sheesh. The male is just weird . . . think stalker who is in his late twenties who talks and acts like he is fifty and a dirty old man fifty at that. He follows the dweeb of a female (he must know a victim when one comes into view, cause there is just nothing interesting about this girl) to the hardware store where she works in another state. There is a really strange (as in 'nudge,nudge,wink,wink') exchange about cable ties, masking tape, and rope. . . natural filament rope, of course. All this is going to lead to bondage, bad sex scenes, and poor writing and then bondage and then lots more poor writing. Avoid, avoid, avoid, or you will loose not only your money, but some brain cells, too. THIS IS A BAD BOOK.
B000002OX7|5.0|The first time I heard Baba Oreilly it just BLEW ME AWAY. And listening to We Won't get Fooled again on headphones is a mind altering experience. I also love the song is over, my wife, and Bargain.  What memories.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is the best david Baldacci book yet to date. The beginning goes fast. The middle kind of slow and the end goes real fast. If you are a David Baldacci fan then I have to say read it. You won't be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app its keeps me occupied for hours on end. i reccomend it to everybody lol it happens to be my favorite out of all of my apps.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was ambivalent about this book regardless of the positive reviews; however, I went ahead and placed a hold on it at my local library.<br /><br />When I started reading 'The Book Thief' I felt a bit perplexed and felt maybe this book wasn't for me.  After the first few pages I decided to put the book away and pick up the reading the following day.  Instead of the following day, I continued a few hours later.  I am glad I decided to continue reading and not return the book, because, `The Book Thief' is now one of my favorite books.  And I have bought it to add to my collection.<br /><br />I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer so I had to ponder a few times what the writer was trying to relay.  In other words, the book will make you stop to think - it's not one of those books where `red' means `red'.  You will find lots of similes and metaphors throughout the book.<br /><br />The story of Liesel's life is beyond captivating and the writer made me feel as though I was actually there during her highs and lows.  Liesel is charming, funny, witty and a young girl who's been through loss and abandonment but somehow managed to get beyond her early struggles.<br /><br />The characters are all alive, with their own peculiar personalities; their different stories of life to tell.  The characters are almost palpable and not one of them can be called boring.<br /><br />The story of Liesel's life is narrated by Death - yes, `death', as in, the Grim Reaper.  You'll find Death to be quite a comic, likable and almost human.  With a very busy work schedule.<br /><br />This book brings out various emotions and quite frankly, I cried when I read some aspects of the book.  It was a very emotional read, some people may say depressing.  However, it was worth reading.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|i just to say excelent edition, very complete, and the best is the most mysterious movie that i have seen!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well, it seems that every other reviewer has already described what a great read this book really is. What else is there to say? Simply put, this series of novellas is a roller coaster. It isn't just any roller coaster, it's the best one at the park. If I try to explain what it's like to ride that roller coaster, the words just come out an excitedly jumbled mess. The adrenaline gets pumping and I no longer make sense, but you can see the pure excitement on my face. Don't like roller coasters? Then it's a water slide. Hate water slides? Then it's one of the best meals you've ever eaten. If you don't like roller coasters, or water slides, or food, don't read this book. If you're human, then I highly recommend it. Be one of the cool people who gets to experience something great!
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great story teller. Not one of his most recent stories, but it is a page turner. Set in the cold war era, it is a story that could well have taken place.  Story takes you from Moscow to Geneva, to France to Great Britan and the United States. Highly recommend this book.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I've been a fan since day one of the AMC series. I've always had a fixation on apocolyptic dramas (especially when zombies are involved) but The Walking Dead takes the cake. It's easy to see why this has become an instant cult classic.

1595827684|5.0|This is definitely a must have for any Mass Effect fan. It shows the wonderful talent and all the effort that went into creating every detail of the Mass Effect universe as a whole. Overall, if you're a fan of art books or just one who wants to delve deeper into the mythos, this book is a wonderful buy.<br /><br />However, the binding could be a little better.
0007447868|5.0|I had approached this book with trepidation because of many lukewarm reviews and disappointment in this book.  Like most reviewers, I loved the first three books and worried that the series' quality could not last.  After A Storm of Swords, I couldn't help myself and dove right into this novel.  Surprisingly, I ended up loving it.  Really loving it!  Maybe because the book has been out for a while and I already knew that Tyrion and Daenerys weren't in it, I didn't suffer for years waiting for the next installment and then finding my favorite characters weren't in the book.  I already knew they wouldn't be there.  I was not put off by the book's length so that wasn't a problem.  I was able to savor what is actually in the book.<br />The story opens not long after A Storm of Swords ends.  Cersei is now ruling the kingdom with a nine year old boy who enjoys playing with the king's stamp and signs everything she puts in front of him.  Tyrion has escaped from the black cells with the help of Jamie and killed their father, Tywin.  It fills her with terror that he is loose and anticipates Tyrion killing her.  Jamie is more wary of Cersei and doesn't want to resume their relationship.  At the Eyrie, Sansa has become Alayne, Petyr's bastard daughter and is a companion to Lord Robert, a boy who acts younger than his years.  Brienne has gone into the heart of Westeros to search for Sansa Stark as she pledged to do for Catelyn Stark.  Arya has also changed her name to Cat.  She is attempting to join a mysterious order which insists she give up her former self.  Living among these strange people who feed her and cloth her provides solace because she believes her other family members are dead and Westeros has not provided safety for her.  Sam Tarley on the Wall is motivated to chase the comet with Aemon Targaryen who believes it is a prophecy of dragons and travels to some of the free cities.  There is even a small subplot involving a princess of Dorne and a Knight's Watchman who is guarding Princess Marcella, daughter of Queen Cersei and Jamie Lannister, her twin brother.  Jamie is dealing with his help of Tyrion, who murdered his father and apparently his son, Joffrey.<br />Like The Sopranos, many characters come near each other but don't meet.  The exception is KIng's Landing where the characters visit the castle.  I believe many action fans may be disappointed by the lack of progression of the story but I found pleasure in getting to know the characters, some of whom were small footnotes in other books or existed not at all.  Martin has an extensive knowledge with Medieval history and language.  With my Kindle Fire, I was able to look up the meanings of words, some repeatedly because it was not cumbersome to do so.  It helped with my understanding of the book immensely.  The background of Westeros which resembles the backwoods of medieval times highlights how dangerous the woods were in general and even more so in wartime.  The characters who try to move around the country are not safe and criminals, robbers and knights were to blame.  The cultural understanding, language use and geography knowledge Martin has is a boon to the novel and places his characters in a world that is almost real.  Magic and organized religion would have been mixed together and been very real to these people.  Most of all the heart of the characters such as Brienne, Arya, Sansa, Sam and Jamie are clear.  Cersei is believable too.  I am curious how the TV show will organize this book's story if it gets that far but it can certainly alter the arrangement to fit in the most beloved characters as well as the new.  There has been talk of filming more than one season at a time and this might work.  Overall, I loved this book without hesitation and look forward to reading the next book.  Then I will be waiting for years like the early fans.is guarding Princess Marcella, daughter of Queen Cersei and Jamie Lannister, her twin brother.

1416550550|5.0|There's no doubt that successful fiction writers must be fascinating storytellers.  Kate Morton, author of THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN, claims her place at an elite table with this magnificent novel.  Her book is a dark wood of fantasy and secrets, fairies and demons, and pathways in need of markers.  Morton is a gentle and reassuring guide that takes you through the complicated maze she has created.  You will not get lost.<br /><br />THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN reminds readers that books are an escape.  One reads to enter a world that's different from the humdrum existence we all experience at times.  In The Garden, every page has a secret that compels further reading while letting the reader sink into a different being.  There are scenes that both frighten and delight and the story is compelling.  In the end, I had a sense of needing air, so breathtaking was the story that Morton told me.<br /><br />The book is big and complex.  The time frame is from the early 1900s through 2005.  The locations include London, Brisbane, Cornwall, and New York.  There are five generations chronicled.  There are acts of treachery, kindness, adultery, kidnapping, and murder.  Activity takes place in manors, cottages, palaces, hovels and hotels.<br /><br />But Morton is able to keep the characters untangled and the situations clear so the reader can keep up with the story without confusion.  Indeed the charm of the book is the gentle unwinding of the plot by merging the characters and their activities with different time periods.  The technique of clearly heading chapters with locations and dates brings the disparate action into focus.  The plot, intricate as it is, is also made decipherable by using the chapter headings to decode the different tales being told.  It sounds like arduous reading, but I found it to be mesmerizing and not at all tedious.<br /><br />Morton includes a few fairy tales in her story and I hope she will develop an illustrated child's book incorporating them.  This book tookme back to my childhood love of fairy tales and fantasy adventures while touching my adult fondness for mystery and detestable behavior.  This is a glorious book that must be read.<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALES
0345803485|1.0|This was one of the most insufferable pieces of garbage I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I can't believe I actually made it through this entire book. The agony begins early on in this Twilight-esque fairy tale. The heroine is \\"Bella\\" remove the spine and take away all self esteem and dignity. At twenty-one \\"Ana\\" is unrealistically naïve not only about sex but about most everything else. She has absolutely no self worth, questions everything and even when her instincts give her answers she ignores them. She remains a quivering clueless blob throughout the book until the end when she looks like she is finally growing some balls but I fear it will be short lived or there wouldn't be two more books.<br /><br />The Antagonist \\"Mr. Grey\\" is a self centered bore who constantly contradicts himself and is in serious need of some therapy. Add some very cliché and predictable sex scenes mixed with some poor humor and you have this book in its entirety. All I can say is... \\"That's twenty hours I'll never get back\\". The thought of martyring through the second and third books just to see how it all ends is agonizing.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Possibly the best Mission Impossible yet. Tom Cruise puts in another brilliant performance as Ethan Hunt. This time around Paula Patton in the cast as an IMF agent, proves she is not only a pretty face, but a great actress, and Jeremy Renner, well... it's Jeremy Renner, his performance is always spot on. If your looking for an action packed thriller, this is a must see!
0345803493|3.0|Ok, this book manages to redeem some of the respect lost by the first book of this whole still unrealistic fairy tale. The two unlikely main characters seem to come into their own somewhat during this step of the torturous journey that is the Fifty Shades Trilogy.<br /><br />Ana's internal monolog is still somewhat over done and if all the times she asks herself the same questions, says \\"hot\\" and \\"oh my\\" were cut from the book it would be more resemblant of a pamphlet than a novel. She has managed to retain the balls she grew at the end of the first book with regard to Christian Grey.  I can only hope that in the next book she uses some of Christian's money to buy a personality.<br /><br />The elementary sex scenes are repetitive and way over done but this second book is at least a little more exciting yet no more believable than the first. I'm on the fence with regard to the third book.

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was really enjoying this game &amp; it can be quite addicting albiet a little cheesy. However I have had several problems/glitches. The game frequently freezes and has to be force closed.  I was doing really well into levels in the mid thirties with lots of businesses, houses and completing challenges.  I left the game &amp; when I came back suddenly all of the production times for everything from food to when you could collect $ went from a few minutes or a couple hours depending on the item to 300+hours.  This effectively makes it impossible to keep playing because you can't do anything. I tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling but ran into the same problem again.  Guess I shouldn't expect much more from a free app but it was pretty disappointing.  If it weren't for these problems I would have given more stars cuz the game is fun until this problem occurs.

B00753MBHA|5.0|Great new release from one of Germany's best,this one takes a spin in the same vein as blood of the nations,a great effort,but I think Blood is a little better,don't get me wrong,it offers all that you expect from Accept,but fro me I like Blood better,listen to it yourself and compare,you won't be disappointed!
0345803485|1.0|Sex filled?  Sure, but so poorly written it's not even hot.  Ask your loved one to write you a dirty email/text and you'll have better material than this book.  No depth and written so poorly it is impossible to read without being annoyed about every 3 sentences.  It sounded like some horny teenage girl decided to write about her fantasies in the poorest fashion.  This chick never heard of a thesaurus (calling the female genitals either 'down there' or 'my sex') and constantly just keeps calling the man 'hot' and herself 'inner goddess'.<br /><br />I was pretty pissed at myself that I wasted time reading the book til the end but I thought it was going to lead to something ANYTHING...nope.<br /><br />If this chick wasn't some big time tv producer this book wouldn't even pass as a good porn script.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I will admit I was sucked into the hype, needed something to read, and didn't do my research on this book ....its the most poorly written, maddening thing I've ever read! As others have said, there are multiple portions of the 'plot' replayed on nearly every page of all three books. There are times when you think there's actually going to be insightful character or story development but then Ana (NOT A HEROINE) bites her lip and we're back to page 4 of  book 1.<br />If you like great characters in great stories you will be frustrated by this! Don't do it!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not my typical read. I didn't think this would be a book I would enjoy, but everyone at work was raving about it, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I read it in two days. I could not put it down! Very well written. I highly recommend this book. Very entertaining. A great read!!

0451216725|4.0|I'm excited looking at the reviews, that a descent amount of reviewers are saying this is a weaker effort of his.  I was hooked after the first 3 chapters.<br /><br />The plot is NASA scientist who's working on the jupiter 5 america's first orbiting satellite This is during the Cold War and the USSR already has one in orbit.  so much depends on this, basically if we could do this we can successfully bomb you back, Lucas the Scientist wakes up with his memory wiped out,in Washington DC dressed as a bum in union station bathroom with another bum.  lucas is on a race against time to put the clues to his life back together, knowing who in his personal life he can trust.  You as a reader get to know the real Luke by flashbacks and see the choices he made and what he regrets.<br /><br />There's some great twist and turns, I could have a couple more flashbacks to give you the full story, once some of the truth is revealed about his family and friends.<br /><br />All the lead characters are pretty fascinating Luke and Anthony  being the stand out but there are two strong woman characters in Billie and Elsbeth.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you are a thriller , historical fiction, or Michael Chrichton fan, (that's what the book felt like to me). This book is a page turner and reads very fast, enjoy.

B007I2BYX0|5.0|I have loved The Pretty Reckless from the beginning, having bought the Light Me Up album aswell as the EP. I bought this with no hesitation. It's in the air, theres a new album coming and darn right im ready,<br /><br />Make Me Wanna Die (Live):<br />This goes to show how lively and fun the band is live. I really enjoyed it and it was very good. They are just as good live as they are in the studio. 9/10<br /><br />Hit Me Like A Man:<br />Great new material from the band, I loved it!. It makes me anxious and excited for the new album, complete perfection. Her vocals are sexy and fun, with band playing rough and . 10/10<br /><br />Under The Water:<br />Great, slowed down song. Another great example of new Pretty Reckless material, again Taylor blows me away with her vocals and the backing band is amazing as always. 10/10<br /><br />Since Your Gone (Live):<br />Just like the other like set on the EP, really great and a awesome overall  song. Almost better than the album studio version. Great! 9/10<br /><br />Cold Blooded:<br />So here we come to another new song. I can't really put my finger on it but i think Cold Blooded, is one that I don't like. I mean its not bad. But sometimes catchiness isn't good and this may be a prime example. Like i said it's not bad but it's not phenomenal. 8/10<br /><br />Overall, i think The Pretty Reckless pleasantly surprised us with this new release. Very good and recommended if you are a really big fan. If your not then you can just wait for the album. 9/10
B001GJ2ZP2|5.0|I loved this album and recently got into vinyl, so I decided to check it out on Amazon. Lady Gaga is one of the few artists I really like and makes vinyls as well. I was very satisfied with the music and everything of course. What really blew me away was the cover art and inside the record sleeve. I'm happy the own the album that started it all. :)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I ordered this album on one day and received it the next day. Packaging was very good. The quality of the recordings were 1st rate.<br /> On Adele, what can I say that hasn't been said already. She is what most female artists of R&B strive to be.<br />I never tire of listening to her.  This album has the best tunes she has recorded, in my opinion.<br />Highly recommended..
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|My first Sylvia Day book...and I am in a state of \\"How did I not know about this author till now??!!\\"<br /><br />This book is AMAZING I can't stop thinking about it. Every time I had to put it down for one reason or another I was thinking about it. I finished it this morning and I am still thinking about it!! Seriously WOW!!!!!<br /><br />I have had NO sleep since I started it... well barely ...I did nod off for an hour last night and was so annoyed with myself I mean who needs sleep right?! So I have to tell you to read this book...it was an emotional journey, it was completely addictive and it was amazingly HOT!! Seriously \\"knicker cam'ing hot\\" top of the cam-o-meter HOT!!! My girls will know what I am saying here!!! LOL.....<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are two very damaged people who find in each other what they need to absolve and free themselves...but that does not come easy!! Like Eva asked:<br />\\"Can two dysfunctional people have a functional relationship?\\"<br /><br />I loved Eva, she was strong, knew what she wanted and went for it, she is a survivor! She is probably one of my favorite book heroines, her story touched my heart and her survival was inspiring!<br /><br />And...Gideon...I have barely any words for how much I LOVE him! Gideon is \\"damaged\\", he is haunted, he is amazing, he is controlling, HOT, sex on legs...yeah I could go on and on...I am speculating like crazy trying to figure out by what and who he was scarred by and even though I have a sneaky feeling I CANNOT wait for book 2..I need it like right now!!<br /><br />Oh and I don't want to forget Cary...beautiful damaged soul...I need to know what happens next for him!<br /><br />The relationship between Gideon and Eva is so intense, absolutely beautiful, two tortured souls trying to make it right. The passion between them...bloody hell...it had me hooked from the start.<br /><br />I know this is going to be in my top reads of 2012!!

B006RUJST6|5.0|Ok where do I start?!<br /><br />It's really hard to describe how beautiful, intense, emotional and heartwarming this story is! I don't think I can give a review that does this book justice. Yes, that is how much I loved the story and the messages in it. I'm a mum and I FELT it to the core!!!<br /><br />This book took me on such an emotional journey that I was actually worn out at the end. I think I cried pretty much through the whole story, but this is no bad thing, this just shows the amazing talent of Colleen Hoover to so thoroughly evoke these strong emotions through her amazing talent!!<br /><br />I fell in LOVE with Layken, Will and their families and I could not leave them for one minute, well I could but I DID NOT want to.... ;0)!!!<br /><br />Also, I've got to say I am not known to read poetry but WOW....I found myself re-reading those several times, some of them left me breathless with emotion!<br /><br />If you haven't read it DO!! Oh and don't forget the tissues...I went through a whole box of them!!

When I first read it last year I read it again immediately after because I couldn't let it go. It's an emotional roller coaster of a ride that gets so intense and passionate that it's a \\"read in one sitting\\" type book! It has frustrating twists and drama. I fell in love with all the characters and even though Travis drove me mad at times..he is Travis...and I fell in love with him!! I laughed, I cried and I shouted (alot!)..and still did reading it again and again....If that doesn't mean it's one of the best books I've ever read I don't know what does!

B007CKNX28|4.0|I love the wayward singer songwriter second half of this album that some of the other reviews slag.  The front half of this record is loaded with the rockers you'd expect, but the second half gets interesting in a damaged early 1970's cult pop country rock sort of way.
1608193381|1.0|The author writes nonsense and false fabrications of the concept of the \\"free market\\".<br />All this pamflet is - is an appoligia for the statism and government interventionism.<br />This fellow is a Fed's Keynesian trumpeteer, and in his servile role, he will get some<br />pats on his shoulder (and likely some paid \\"consultant projects\\" with the Fed.)<br />Check the artcle in the Huffington post: \\"Priceless: How The Federal Reserve Bought The Economics Profession\\"<br />Prof Chen is just one more lovely example.<br />He is a servile Fed's low-level priest, waving his 'cross' loud and noisy, so the<br />top echalons of the interventionist elite don't even need to bother fending off the criticism.<br />In brief, this book is one bad piece of appologist propaganda.<br />Shame on the author and his Cambridge tenure.
0743437497|5.0|Though at first glance, THE SHINING is simply a story about a haunted house (certainly something that has been done before), it remains one of the best stories I have EVER read.  If you are thinking of picking up this book, the best thing you can do is stop thinking about it and start reading it.  Not only is it one of Stephen King's best, most masterful tales, it is one of the best suspense novels written today.  And not because it is supernaturally horrifying (though it certainly has it's moments).  But rather, because the most chilling part of THE SHINING is how King takes you down a path of madness that feels a little too real for fiction.<br /><br />THE SHINING builds slowly.  We get to know the Torrence family - Jack, a recovering alcoholic who struggles to find steady work but longs to support his family; Wendy, his wife, who loves him despite some past physical abuse at the hands of Jack's temper and his love for gin, and Danny, their young son who holds the struggling family together.  Both parents, however dysfunctional desire more than anything to raise their son and love him better than their parents loved them.  Their imperfection is that more painful because of this simple, noble desire.<br /><br />But Danny is not just any young boy.  He has what King calls \\"The Shining\\".  The ability to hear others thoughts, feel their feelings, and occasionally get a glimpse of the future.  And when Jack takes a job at the Overlook Hotel as its winter caretaker, Danny's premonitions grow darker and darker.<br /><br />Imagine, a huge, old historic hotel up in the bitterly cold and isolating Colorado Mountains.  It's tucked away for the winter.  The rooms are locked, there are sheets over much of the furniture.  The chairs are up in the grand ballroom. It is just you and your family for several months - cooking in the great kitchen, enjoying several of the rooms to yourselves, and wandering the halls when there is nothing else to do.  It creaks and groans as it settles in, and you're its only heart; the only thing alive in all the cold.<br /><br />The haunting begins almost immediately.  From strange bumps in the night, to the moving of topiary animals, to certain presences destined to live out their final moments their old rooms.  But King escalates these occurrences until the hotel begins to come to life with all its old and darkest characters.  And they are looking for new members to join them - to stay forever.  But they won't kill you to do that.  Rather, they'd rather have you do it yourself.<br /><br />Thus begins a story of madness and seduction for Jack.  Despite the fact that he no longer drinks; despite the fact that position at The Overlook hotel represents a new start for his family; despite the fact that he and his wife begin to rediscover why they are together, the house begins to whisper in his ear.  It sends him thoughts of his own father - another physical abuser.  It reminds him of his thirst.  It puts twisted thoughts in his head of how Wendy and even Danny don't respect him, don't trust him and secretly feel that their lives would be better without him.  And finally, it reintroduces him to his great foil.  The ghost of the bartender Lloyd visits him more and more often, inviting him to the grandest parties and the smoothest drinks as the lines between madness and reality, the past and the present blur into one.  He fights, he fights, and then he falls to the hotel and its desire to keep them all there.  As the family and the hotel unravel into their worst versions of themselves, it's hard to tell what is most frightening - the ghosts of the dead or the dark hearts of the living.  Towards the end, Wendy thinks to herself, \\"There was a stale odor of gin and olives about him that seemed to set off an old terror in her, a worse terror than any hotel could provide by itself.\\"<br /><br />In the end (and don't worry, I won't give away the end), this story comes down to a twisted and destructive love of family.  Andwhether or not the darkest vices can truly destroy the bonds between a father and a son.<br /><br />I envy you, new reader!  For you get to read this amazing story for the first time.  Enjoy it.  And when you get to chapters \\"Inside 217\\" and \\"217 Revisited\\" make sure you're alone, and it's quiet...and dark.<br /><br />Carrie Salo<br />Author of the Supernatural Thriller - The Soundingwhether or not the darkest vices can truly destroy the bonds between a father and a son.<br /><br />I envy you, new reader!

B001FB5634|5.0|There is little I could add to the scores of previous reviews. To me, the movie was all-engrossing and scary. I constantly wondered what was going to happen next.  What I didn't like was Viggo's characteristic muttering and mumbling, which for me was hard to understand. As many others, I wondered what I would do in various circumstances, and would have done else-wise in some.  I wondered when he saw the beached ship, how he got up the side of it, and that all he salvaged was a flare gun and one flare, rather than a floating bag of food, clothing, weapons, etc.  Obviously many things were plot contrivances, but in any event, it is a movie to see for an enlightening glimpse into a post apocalyptic world, even tho it is not very realistic in some areas.
0060853972|1.0|I rarely write reviews on book, but this one was too awful not to write a review and warn other readers.  I was looking forward to a funny book but found myself having to plow through the pages in hope that the end would be worth it.  I am sad to say it was not, and consider the time I spent reading the book a colossal waste of time.  I am disappointed in the time I wasted reading this book and am completely shocked by the positive reviews.  I would strongly suggest to anyone thinking about reading this book to stay far, far away.
B00006AW63|1.0|I guess my first clue should have been \\"\\"available action\\"\\" .  DVD troubleshooting is one of the options. Go figure. This DVD doesn't work in any player!! I am planning on sending it back but I wanted to give a review first so that no one else has this problem.
B002ZG980U|5.0|The plot is incredible, the acting well done, and the ending? Well, the ending makes you want to spend the next few hours watching it again.<br /><br />I enjoyed this DVD version of the movie, as well as the features associated with it. Good quality and sound help to make this a good conversion to DVD.
B00640Z0RI|5.0|Dispatches is a stirring account of a photo journalist experiences during the Vietnam war. It helps to shed light on the horrible experiences of war, and helps to explain why men sometimes do the most awful things to one another. Having served in the army in the early 1980s I had the opportunity to talk to several men who served in Vietnam. These men deserve so much respect. I feel this book helps to honor our veterans.
0142000671|5.0|**This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />Oh, boy, it's \\"Hamlet Syndrome work\\" time again.  I define \\"Hamlet Syndrome work\\" as a work of literature that has been analyzed, dissected, and discussed so thoroughly that it's hard to say anything new or original about it. Steinbeck's enduring novella \\"Of Mice and Men\\" (hereafter OM&M) certainly qualifies. OM&M has permeated life and society's consciousness, at least American life and consciousness, probably because it unpretentiously depicts the main existential question of life: Is it worth living? Should we bother living?  At first glance, OM&M, from its title onward, seems to suggest NO.<br /><br />We have the classic split personality \\"brains and brawn\\" duo in George and Lennie.  Despite their respective qualities, they could be considered life's hopeless losers. They are impoverished migrant workers and even fugitives because of an assault the mentally handicapped Lennie inadvertently committed upon a woman.  Despite his vast strength, Lennie is a high-maintenance, perpetual man-baby who needs almost constant supervision.  George profanely complains about the burden Lennie poses.  Like just about all the other characters in OM&M, they feel isolated and desperate, or at least they would if they didn't have each other.  Nevertheless, defying the odds, George manages to wrangle himself and Lennie farm worker jobs.<br /><br />Things seems to settle down well.  George and Lennie have saved money from previous jobs.  The grizzled, dejected old custodian Candy has some money.  Perhaps together they can buy a slice of earthly paradise: a rabbit farm where Lennie can live safe and secure and pet his animal friends.  But the boss's ostracized, belligerent son Curley and his bored, ignored flirtatious wife eventually turn out to be serpents lying in the way.  Lennie, again unintentionally, cripples one and kills the other.  Earthly paradise goes up in smoke, but, some may argue, George mercifully gives Lennie a way to an otherworldly paradise.<br /><br />OM&M portrays the apparently dead-end, humdrum, lonesome, hopeless rural world of Depression-era America.  But like some great works of literature, it finds hope where there is no hope to be found.  Despite their hard-luck lives, George and Lennie together function as an effective unit.  They nurture a dream and keep going because of it.  Candy helps bring their dream tantalizingly close. Slim, the manager, sympathizes with the duo and does what he can to protect them.  George's mercy killing of Lennie after his manslaughter may be the kindest thing he ever did for Lennie.  He keeps the dream alive for Lennie even as he shoots him in the back of the head.  Slim arranges to have George's homicide appear to be self-defense and even be a shoulder to lean on as George glumly contemplates his \\"freedom\\" from Lennie.<br /><br />OM&M seems to show life as an inevitable tragedy.  However, it shows subtle suggestions that it need not have happened.  Mainly, if George had supervised Lenny a bit more carefully, or had other characters like Crooks the shunned but dignified African-American stablehand (with whom Lenny had struck up a grudging friendship) watch out for him a little more, things may have turned out differently.  OM&M, I think, implies that life could be better and worth living if we WERE a little nicer to each other, cared a little more for each other, helped each other a little more.  This solicitude, coupled with our capacity for hope in even the bleakest situations, is the key to bliss.  Therefore, if God sees our hopes, our plans, our resolve, maybe He really isn't laughing. Maybe He is actually rooting for us.otherworldly paradise.<br /><br />OM&M portrays the apparently dead-end, humdrum, lonesome, hopeless rural world of Depression-era America.

B004SBQALA|4.0|The movie is in great condition and plays perfectly.  My problem was the case outside did not come with original cover and the round tip inside the case that holds the DVD secure to the case was broken so the DVD slid around inside the case. I contacted COBYONE who I ordered the DVD from and explained my situation.  COBYONE'S reply was that it was written on the advertisement may not come with original cover.  I always look carefully to ensure I am ordering the Blu-Ray version DVD and that I am getting the original case and cover.  COBYONE said he would find a case with original cover and send one to me that was the begining of April. I even told COBYONE that I am willing to pay for it. This is May 3rd and have not heard from COBYONE.

B00005N6KG|4.0|These are very compact and comfortable and are one of the few over the head style headphones with a thin enough headband so that they can be worn under a well fitting bicycling helmet.  This no ear blockage style of mini headphone used to be commoner but the MDR-W08L seems to be the only remaining model in production that I am aware of.<br /><br />Their design provides little or no blocking of external sound which I consider an advantage for use when cycling on public roads or in other situations where awareness of the environment is necessary as a matter of safety.  They are not intended for use in a noisy environment where you want isolation from external noise.  With their separate cords for each earphone I have not noted any crosstalk between sides.  Sound reproduction is good for such small and inexpensive headphones IMO.  Adequate for almost all uses, taking into account the environment they are best used in.<br /><br />The wires are thin and a bit delicate in my opinion but the headphones are inexpensive enough so keeping a spare set on hand is a reasonable precaution.

0345803485|5.0|I loved loved loved this trilogy!  I highly recommend reading them!  Well written, funny, sweet, and very very sexy. A beautiful love story. I've heard some horrible reviews for these books, calling it abusive, etc, but it isn't. NOT AT ALL.  I suggest not to judge before reading.  LIke I said, it's a beautiful love story.  I just finished the last book yesterday and I'm already reading the first book again. I can't say enough good things about this trilogy. I really hope the author continues this story because I can't get enough of it!  This story is totally fictional, but one can only dream of finding an unconditional love like what Christian and Ana have found in each other.  Beautiful.  Enjoy!

0307593312|4.0|My Tokyo-Boy husband read this in Japanese while I read it in English. (He's not done yet.) And so cultural difference was at the forefront of my brain when reading 1Q84.<br /><br />On the surface, this book is about two young adults who knew eachother once and are looking for a way to reconnect. Both of them have cut ties with their fanatical families and through a cult and a young author of a fantasy novel they reconnect.<br /><br />The Japanese version of 1Q84 is actually three, separate novels. This makes total sense when reading the English version as it does seem to be three different stories: Tengo and Aomame as they enter 1Q84 with Aomame climbing down the expressway stairs and Tengo getting caught up in the writing of Air Chrysalis, Aomame's deadly errand related to the cult, and then finally Ushikawa's surveillance as Tengo hangs with his dad in Chikura (Cat Town).<br /><br />The first part of the novel was extremely interesting. I can't say I actually got \\"drawn into\\" the story, it was more like sinking into a hot bath, immersing myself in the strange, vague-but-detailed world of Tengo and Aomamae and then reveling as each secret connection between them is revealed.<br /><br />For me, the third part went on too long. Way, way, way too long. Murakami is at his recursive best throughout the novel. He constantly has the characters bringing back images and scenes, goes over in detail their backhistory and their moods, and seems to enjoy revisiting each moment again and again like a child picking at a scab.<br /><br />What's revealed beneath these recursive events is the raw, exposed feelings of the characters themselves. That is what I treasure in a Murakami book.<br /><br />But the last third of the book was needlessly drawn out. Although it ends in a pleasantly circular manner (unlike some of his earlier works where too many questions and fates are left hanging), and all the loose ends are tied up, I felt this could have been accomplished without the unnecessary heavy intrusion of Ushizawa.<br /><br />Still, this is Murakami, and part of the journey of one of his books is to follow his unrushed, laid-back, endless-mundane-detailed prose as it creates layer upon layer of images on you so much that you can almost taste the air the characters breathe.<br /><br />And there are moments that strike me as unbelievably odd-but-apt, like this description of Tengo being woken up by the phone:<br /><br />\\"..his voice still slurry from sleep. It was like his head was filled with frozen lettuce. There must be people who don't know you're not supposed to freeze lettuce. Once lettuce has been frozen, it loses all its crispness- which for lettuce is surely its best characteristic.\\"<br /><br />Finally, there's the overwhelming physical-sensual nature of how all the main characters think and act. It is hard not to react to Tengo's obsession with his memory of his mother's sexual act with a stranger and Aomame's pick up of the balding, middle-aged man with the mixed-revulsion-fascination that my American upbringing as inculcated into me.<br /><br />If I somehow step aside from those first reactions, remembering how sex and naked bodies and female desires are treated differently in Japan, then these images and casual attitudes towards sex becomes a physical embodiment of the strange, dream-like emotional connections that occur between the characters.<br /><br />But it takes conscious effort to read the book that way, and I imagine for some Americans their own visceral reactions might be a giant elephant in the room.<br /><br />This is not a book I would recommend to anyone. You have to be willing to give up parts of yourself; the ones wanting concrete answers and real-world logic. The ones that are too biased by American ideas of the plot-shapes of American novels and American sexual mores.<br /><br />However, it is the novel by Murakami, despite the frustrating drawn-out nature of the last third of the book, that expresses best his ability to take the completely unbelievable and fantastical and superimpose it on simple, mundane lives in order to show the beauty of what it means to be human and alone.<br /><br />This Book's Snack Rating: A bag of kaki-no-tani (peanuts mixed with small rice crackers) where the more you eat, the more your tongue catches on fire from the spiced crackers for the layers and layers of characterization and story.

B0057VDGNK|3.0|(3 1/2 stars) It's hard not to compare the original sound track for \\"Drive\\" to the 1980's soundtrack for [[ASIN:B000000OY3 To Live & Die In L.A.: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]], because the movie \\"Drive\\" itself was such an homage to that film. If you've seen \\"To Live & Die\\", you'll immediately think of it when you hear \\"Drive\\" for the first time, especially if you are sitting in a theater.<br /><br />And that soundtrack set the bar very high for OSTs, even though it was done by one of the 1980's largely forgotten groups in Wang Chung. If not for a horrible name with an even more regrettable Top-40 radio lyric (\\"everybody have fun tonight, everybody Wang Chung tonight\\"), that band would easily have been known for one of the best soundtracks of all time rather than for high school reunion mix tapes.<br /><br />How does \\"Drive\\" do? Well, it's certainly very good, and very integral to the film. It has a distinct '80s sound but for the most part does not sound cheesy. The feel is instead very moody and atmospheric (think Miami Vice before it jumped the shark, or maybe even a few elements of Scarface), with a mix of a few vocal songs but predominantly ambient instrumentals. If you saw the movie, this will easily transport you back to it.<br /><br />Some tracks are better than others (and some aren't even really songs), so in my opinion you'll either use this as background music if you want to set a certain tone or you will likely rearrange the order of things on your phone and jettison several of them.  As a soundtrack, in relation to it's importance and effectiveness within the movie, this is close to a 5 star effort in that context.  As a stand alone album, especially if you haven't seen the film, much more of a 3 star.<br /><br />Some may say that is not a valid criticism, but compared to an OST like \\"To Live & Die\\", what brought that soundtrack to perfection was that it worked on ALL levels. It was an integral tone setter for the movie. It was a great stand alone album. You didn't have to see the movie to enjoy most of the tracks (which I think is the case here). \\"Drive\\" is more like [[ASIN:B00005BJJX Aliens: The Deluxe Edition]], not in any direct musical sense, but that most of its contents are not stand alone songs and need to be taken as a whole to work well. While much of it is very good, there are a few tracks that do sound more like those elements of the 80' we are trying to forget.<br /><br />With that being said, this soundtrack is an easy pickup for those who have seen the film and liked it. There seems to be some confusion as to whether all of the material is on this C.D., but from my perspective I didn't find anything missing that I was looking for.<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"Drive\\" yet, I would recommend the film highly and then make a decision on whether to pick up the soundtrack as well. Overall, a solid 3 1/2 star effort you won't be disappointed in as long as you know what you're expecting.e album.

B00723NWJE|4.0|For fans wanting more from last year's [[ASIN:B004E0Z4XK Rome]], which was an interesting soundtrack concept album for a fictitious 1970's-era Italian movie (honest!), by Danger Mouse, Daniele Luppi, and Norah Jones, this ain't it. There are a few stylistic teases, and the collaboration partially returns with Danger Mouse's co-writing. But \\"Broken Hearts\\" comes across first and foremost as a Norah Jones album, and you get the sense she has now had her break out debut, played the field while sowing her musical oats, and is settling into a style she wants to define rather than the other way around.<br /><br />This is a solid atmospheric effort that has grown on me. It is not straight up chill by any means, but many of the tracks can put you in a mellow groove as long as you listen to the music more than the lyrics (if \\"Broken Hearts\\" is a soundtrack about anything, it is for the story of a relationship's very bad end). Overall has a very vintage sound, but not an outdated one. I wish I had bought it on a LP as opposed to CD, I sometimes got the feeling it may have been mixed more with vinyl in mind.<br /><br />Other reviewers may be giving the album knocks for not having super stand out tracks, and I agree, I don't see a lot of big hits coming off of this.  But I'd still have to say this is her most complete package to date, even though many of the songs are short and you can listen through the entire CD rather quickly. \\"Out on the Road\\" and \\"She's 22\\" are the only songs I think I'll skip entirely, but it's interesting to wonder what double meaning might exist when she sings on one \\"I'm holding on to a thing that's wrong...but you like my songs and made me happy\\". She doesn't sound too happy on \\"Miriam\\", a beautifully melodic but lyrically vicious little song that will make you question whether that is a tear drop or a drop of blood on the front cover.<br /><br />Any detractions based on a comparison to \\"Rome\\" would be unfair for a couple of reasons.  One, although many may have wanted a \\"Rome II\\" with more Norah on it (I know I did), I don't think now that is what she set off to do despite me being fooled by the Italian movie inspired cover and Danger Mouse co-credits. But secondly, \\"Rome\\" was really more Luppi's baby than anyone elses. Until Norah decides to pair with him in the future (hint hint), probably the closest we will get would be the more funky, less chill instrumental version in [[ASIN:B0001DMWKM An Italian Story (US Release)]]. She does throw in enough film-noir inspired riffs here and there, and \\"Take it Back\\" sounds very similar to Rome's \\"Black\\" in parts (her favorite song from that album).<br /><br />Musicianship is solid, her voice is great as always, and any production being done is for style and not a cover up (\\"Say Goodbye\\" for example is reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000QQPHSS The Mating Game]]). While I don't think \\"Broken Hearts\\" will be a breakup album for her current fans, the lyrics do make it sound like she is ready to move on from some people she is no longer interested in trying to please.<br /><br />In the end I think there is enough here for her traditional audience to like while she attempts to build a new one. Interestingly, or just coincidence, is that she released the album on May 1st (May-Day).  A jilted lover's desperate last call for help, or a celebration of the spring festival of new beginings?<br /><br />In eco-friendly packaging, contains a fold out poster with a picture of the album cover on one side and the lyrics on the other.ny may have wanted a \\"Rome II\\" with more Norah on it (I know I did), I don't think now that is what she set off to do despite me being fooled by the Italian movie inspired cover and Danger Mouse co-credits.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love the first 2 book but I think she should have stop @ the third book.  Ana was a lil weak but ok.  Christian was to controlling and dark. But I like that.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm so sorry that I purchased this book, and not only that, because I don't like unfinished business, I finished it!  UGH!  What a waste of my time and money.  I got suckered into the hype, and this is the first time I have read a book in this genre.  I won't be making that mistake again.<br /><br />  The storyline is silly, the language leaves much to be desired, and it's unbelievable.  I felt embarrassed for the title character, and wanted her to run for the hills.  I am in no way a prude, but you lose your virginity to someone like Christian Grey, and all of the things he is into don't scare you away?  I wanted her to have a backbone, but I guess it wasn't in the cards.  I would definitely not recommend this drivel.  I am deleting it from my Kindle, as I am embarrassed that someone might see that I got suckered into buying it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter read the Hunger Games months before I did, but she finally convinced me that I needed to take a stab at the book.  I've read many of the same books as she has over the years and one of the major complaints I've found about other series is that they seem to pander to teens.  That is treat them like they're only the only things they're interested in is romance and love eternal and other \\"shipper\\" type ideas.  While that's okay as an ASPECT of a teen novel, it doesn't have to be the entire premise.<br /><br />The Hunger Games proves this.  This series of books treats its readers like the intelligent and discerning young adults that they are. It gives readers a glimpse of a gritty, depressing world - a very realistic future outcome -  and the atrocities a dictatorship can visit on its peoples.<br /><br />Most who would read this already know Katniss' story so I won't beat that horse.  I will say I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its very honest handling of some very touchy material.  I liked that romance was not only in the back seat it was fairly nonexistent in this book.  Katniss' interest in Gale and Peeta is more out of a survivalist's eye rather than a romantic one - the conflict it creates rings truer than most relationships I've read in recent years.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, teens or adults.

1401937268|5.0|I've seen this blue angel deck on the shelves of stores for some time and just thought to myself \\"Oh, its just another Doreen Virtue deck\\"  I've been thinking its nothing but an oracle deck.  For whatever reason, I realize its a Tarot just today...<br /><br />Hmmm... Doreen and Tarot?  Is this going to be a failure deck?  Some of her oracle decks have been hit and miss with me.. mostly misses as I've found them repetitive and misleading or inaccurate... better yet, hard to grasp.  It took careful consideration before I jumped into buying this deck.<br /><br />I must say, its one of Doreen's best decks ever.  The cards make sense and when I pull a card it appropriately addresses the issue at hand and gives feedback that seems to be spot on.  I'm pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />What I love mostly is that the LWB, though short and succinct, is highly precise and excellent at explaining each card.  Its one of the best LWB for tarot cards out there. I really wished this was my first tarot deck... as it makes simplistic usage and sense of the cards.  I think my readings (though very accurate) would be more solid if I had started with a deck such as this.  I highly recommend this deck to any Tarot beginners.  The images aren't scary, harsh, or too themey.  It says Angel deck but a lot of the cards don't have angels on them.  So.. but each major arcana has an Angel associated to it.<br /><br />I liken the Angel Tarot to the Oracle Tarot of Lucy Cavendish.  I love Lucy's decks as they are soo accurate... but I think Doreen with the help of Radleigh Valentine has gotten a deck that is accessible to all.<br /><br />I haven't done much prediction work with this deck, so I will have to follow up this review in a few weeks or months, but it describes current situations a little bit too eerily accurately.<br /><br />PROS:<br />There are key phrases and words printed on each card.  The LWB then goes into more depth about the meanings for those cards and phrases.  This is what makes it an excellent deck for beginners with Tarot and for those who are more advance and just need simple refresher.<br /><br />Cardstock is strong, like most of Hay house older oracle decks.  I like that it doesn't have the gilded edges as it tends to wear off quickly if not applied right.  Cards are vibrant spiritual/royal (purple/indigo), healing (turquoise), grounded/healing (green) gemstone colors.  The artwork can be a little cutesy at times, some more bold and encompassing, some more fractal.  Nothing offending in the artwork or will make you want to say OMG from over usage of a theme.<br /><br />Meanings of the cards are succinct and very accurate... I think that might be Radleigh's contribution.<br /><br />I haven't done much predictive work with this deck, but I did do a daily draw in the morning and it pretty much nailed the obvious (8 of pents = on the job training).<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not many to speak of.  Its the Angel Tarot according to the few Angels that Doreen is comfortable with. So even though the major arcana is composed of the major/familiar angels, its a repetition of a handful of them.  So don't expect to see the 72 angels associated with the Torah in this deck... you might do better with  Kimberly Marooney's Angel Blessings oracle deck for more angel representation.<br /><br />She only gives you 2 or 3 spreads to use.  The Celtic Cross, the past present and future, and finally the single card reading.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />This is a break from Doreen's repetitive decks!!! So fans and non-fans of Doreen Virtue alike will come to enjoy this deck.  It reads differently for me than most of my other tarot decks, less interpretive work is needed so I simply (like one other person also mentioned) take the cards as they come, accept what they have to say as face value.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I like this little Wi-Fi analyzer app.  It performs well and is very convienient.  It was simple to install and gives me a neat colored signal graft on how effective my Wi-Fi router is working on my Kindle Fire.  It also shows on the graft the other possible routers to click on if you wanted to go that route.  The graft is done up very nicely in multi-colors for each Wi-Fi channel available to you at any given time. At the very bottom of the screen is a tiny boxed ad that changes...it does not take away from the graft or annoy the person. If you travel from your home Wi-Fi router set up, this little app helps to change to an available Wi-Fi signal.  Pretty helpful!

B006TJXZ30|3.0|I really like this app and the convience of checking my emails on my Kindle.  It works well and lets me know when a new email is received by a sound on my Kindle.  The one frustrating thing I don't like is that when you delete an email off your Kindle...it also deletes the email off your PC hotmail.  I for one save some emails to files for future reference...you can't do this and delete the email off Kindle.  You are not able to put any emails to files on this Kindle - Hotmail app.  I lost some merchandise purchase emails which contained tracking and payment info.  Seems as if this could be remedied fairly easy if it was worked on...it is a negative feature with this app.  I may end up deleting this hotmail app only for this reason.  If you want to save an email you must leave it on your Kindle.  If you save many emails things get really backed up on your Kindle Hotmail.  I emailed Hotmail about this but never got a reply.  Please weigh the goods and bads here...this app may be perfect for you.

0439023513|5.0|This book was so great.  I loved it from the beginning until the end.  Suzanne Collins has the ability to weave a story that draws the reader into a world of her making.  I felt that as the trilogy went on the characters developed a life of their own.  My only complaint with this book, and it's a minimal complaint, is that the end of Mockingjay felt so abrupt.  Within a few pages the fate of Katniss, Peeta, Annie, Haymitch and others are breifly discussed... and then THE END.  I felt that Suzanne Collins could have devoted another book to the rebuilding of their lives following the downfall of the capital, but she didn't.  It just ended.  If I could have given it 4.75 stars, I would have, if just for that reason alone.  Otherwise I loved everything about it.

1416972250|5.0|This book concerned me when I first started reading it.  It had a slow start and I wasn't sure where the plot was leading and then...WHAM!  The storyline took the most startling turn and the action began.  I could not stop thinking about this book for the next 3 days.  I was re-thinking everything as I worked, as I ate my meals, and as I fell asleep.  The story consumed me and it had so many twists and turns that I felt anger, frustration, happiness, and anguish for the characters.  I have recommended this book to students and they all agree...this book is excellent.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|This book annoyed me on the first page, with its reference to Rhea Perlman as the \\"diminutive Cheers bartendress\\": She wasn't a bartendress, she was a server (or waitress, if you're into feminizations of words, which Foer seems to be).  But it won me over soon after.<br /><br />Foer, a journalist, went to cover a memory tournament, and then decides to spent a year training his memory.  This book tells the story of that year, wherein he goes from having an average memory to competing in the U.S. Memory Championship (I won't give away the ending).  He uses his own experience as a launchpad to discuss such varied topics as the history of memorization in education (loved to vilified) and of memorization techniques (from ancient Greece to Mark Twain to modern-day self-help gurus), what we know about the science around memory, and what we know from science about expertise.  He meets and describes various savants and memory experts (what a cast of characters!).  He talks about the shift to external memory (recording stuff on paper and electronically) over time and the implications of that; all of these explorations are informed by interesting, thought-provoking research.  The pacing is good.  About halfway through, I worried that the book would get slow, but Foer actually manages to get the adrenaline pumping about a memory contest, and brings up the pace gradually as we approach the end.<br /><br />I learned some cool techniques from this book.  I've used the Memory Palace method (filled with striking visuals) to memorize a list of people's names, and I'm starting to learn what's called the Marshall Method to learn numbers (e.g., phone numbers, credit card numbers).  I was particularly excited when I got to the chapter on memorizing poetry, but basically we learn there that memorizing poetry is really hard: Many people just use a Memory Palace, creating a visual for every single word in the poem (including articles and conjunctions).<br /><br />Let me share one thought-provoking passage that I enjoyed.  Foer tells the story of Michel Siffre, French scientist who spent two months in an underground cave with no access to clock, calendar, or sun.  At the end of two months, when his team contacted him, he thought only a month had passed.  Foer's inference, although not the only possible one, is interesting: \\"Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it.  You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one.  If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next - and disappear.  ... Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives.\\"<br /><br />Note on content:  Besides the mention of using lascivious images to better lodge items into our memories and some intoxication, nothing I remember.<br /><br />Why I read this book:  I read a very positive review in the Washington Post.
1416972242|5.0|Cassandra Clare has done an excellent job creating a story around multiple characters and is able to maintain the story's integrity.  I felt Clary and Jace's pain and their heartbreak too.  I waited for this book and when I read it, it was worth all the waiting.  Most definitely worth the wait.  The story of the Shadowhunters continues within New York City, a world separate, yet inclosed within NYC.  If you are a fan of  YA fantasy, then this is the book for you.
B0045I3EJC|1.0|This was the most pretentious movie I have watched in a long time!!! In an attempt to make the movie cerebral the director and author have made something utterly devoid of anything meaningful. The main character could not form a single healthy relationship - he was either too needy or too detached to actually care for another human in a healthy manner. His supposed love story with Anna left the audience completely unsatisfied, and did not develop the relationship beyond that of a fifteen-year-old infatuation. The entire movie was both predictable and utterly bizarre. After 2 and a half hours of confusion I am left both uncaring and frustrated - I want to know the point of it all, but I don't give a damn about any of the major characters. Overall, I would say: Save yourself, and don't waste your time!
0439023491|5.0|Often when you read trilogies the middle book ends up as a very long set-up for the final book in the trilogy.  That was not the case with Catching Fire.  Wow!  This book was just as exciting as the first and the introduction of new characters only added to the story line.  It does an excellent job of making the reader hate the capital more than they did in the first book, if that is even possible.  This book is most certainly a page turner that will keep you up late.  Excellent.
B007549W62|3.0|The film opens with a series of nuclear detonations in New York City.  A group of people in an apartment building fight their way to the bomb shelter below the building and wait.  The super of the building, played by Michael Biehn, is a total jerk and is very nasty to the other survivors.  None of the survivors seem to get along and there is a whole lot of arguing and fighting that ensues.  Most of the characters are thoroughly unlikeable and this is a real weakness of the film.  How are we supposed to care what happens to the survivors if we don't like them?  Another thing I did not like was how the survivors immediately turned on each other almost as soon as they reached the bomb shelter.  It did not seem that people in that situation would immediately start fighting one another.  Wouldn't they at least bond a little in their confusion and fear following a nuclear attack?  Wouldn't they try to work together at first?  Finally, the government comes but its not the rescue the survivors hoped for.  Things get even worse and desperate and things get very ugly and brutal as the survivors get even more hopeless and desperate.  This is not the feel good movie that you want to enjoy with your family.  I knew that going into this and even enjoy movies that don't always go for a happy ending.  But I have to say the sheer ugliness of the movie wore on me after a while.  This movie could have been far better if there were some characters who we actually like and care about as the plot unfolds.

B007KOYEOC|4.0|I love a happy ending and Fifty Shades of Grey: Freed certainly delivered the goods for me. I was a little disappointed with the second book, Darker, but this book more than made up for it. The plot developed much further than just lots of sex and the story was written from both Christian and Ana's viewpoints which added depth for me. I was particularly fascinated by the complexities of Christian's character. I enjoyed how the author maintained the suspense of his character.<br />The relationship between Ana and Christian has greatly evolved and they are equal partners now. I wasn't too keen on the submissive/ dominant relationship which they experienced in the previous books. It didn't seem particularly healthy or balanced to me, but having said that it's refreshing to read a book that is as daring and different as the Fifty Shades Trilogy.<br />Overall, I very much enjoyed the Fifty Shades Trilogy. Ultimately, it's a wonderfully romantic, touching love story between two people who are willing to work through their issues and fight for their love.

B0055EDCGU|4.0|In Waves is a fantastic album.  A lot of people have dismissed it's being not as technical or heavy as Shogun.  While this is partially true, as In Waves lacks the progressive thrash elements that Shogun had, this record is both more melodic and catchy, but also heavier in some places.<br /><br />The first thing you must note is that you can't judge the album based on the title track.  I personally love the song, but I can understand why it makes people nervous, with the plethora of metalcore-esque breakdowns and the radio-friendly song-structure, but the album as a whole is not a chugga-chugga radio-single fest as some would have you believe.<br /><br />All that aside, let me get into the music itself.  As I mentioned before, the progressive elements are significantly diminished, with fewer guitar solos and shorter songs, but the melodies are fantastic.  Matt Heafy's singing has improved a lot since the early days and you can really hear it this time around.  The screaming has also gotten a lot more dynamic, with more variety than any Trivium record to date.  Metalcore screams of past endeavors are now supplemented by almost death metal sounding growls and it sounds fantastic.<br /><br />Instrumentally, In Waves dominates.  The new drummer Nick Augusto does a great job, and while his style is really a matter of personal taste, I feel like I must defend his technical ability.  He delivers some great fills throughout and even includes a few blast beats.  The guitars are great as always, with shorter more concise grooves than Shogun or the Crusade.  There are less solos and lead fills, but they're still there, and they shred.  There's a ton of variety too, ranging from more simple melodic grooves to brutal onslaughts in the heavier songs.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great heavy metal album, and I definitely recommend picking it up.
B003Y7AR7C|5.0|I absolutely love the Nutcracker ballet. After looking at all the versions available online and in the stores I loved this one best. The costumes are just perfect and the dancing is spectacular. Everything about this version seemed the best to me - from the overall appearance, the sets, the detail and quality of the costumes and especially the ability of the dancers. This is one of the first things I have to watch for the holidays. I would definitely recommend this version of The Nutcracker to anyone who wants the best experience of this ballet.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|pretty fun game wish ar could build energy faster that would be great hay gun fun fun fun fun fun
B001NLKT60|5.0|I watched the movies first and got totally hooked. It only made sense to read the books too.  Awesome stuff
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Good fun. It makes you pay attention. I love it. The game iis good for a quick bit of fun and relaxation.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Haven't gotten to it yet, but can not wait....love all the other books of this author too. What an imagination!
0307592731|5.0|BOUGHT FOR MY WIFE WHO HIKED BY IN THE DAY SHE LOVED THE BOOK EASY TO READ MOVES ALONG WELL ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU READ THE BOOK FAST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP.
B007WOQLHS|1.0|Amazon really should remove this title from their listings because it is incomplete. The story is amazing, but the product itself is misleading and incomplete.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a unique and fun twist to typical post-apocolyptic world.  Character development was done very well and the story overall was one I really enjoyed.  I'd definitely recommend it.
1878424114|5.0|Classic book. This is a great addition to any book collection. If you don't have it, you need to get it! Deepak is has tremendous insight.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I read the book last week and started to put his strategy to work in just a part of my writers platform to see if it really worked and I was amazed at the results! I FINALLY and Immediately felt for the first time that I not only had an understanding of how a platform can work together but that I had a grasp on how to market now that I will be able to work it! I created and run a writers group for women over 40 called Blooming Late on shewrites.com who will mostly self publish because of our age and we have been scouring the net for advice like this to help us out. We don't have a lot of extra time at middle age to waste and mess around with so I have been plugging this book hard to them as well as to all my writer friends. Especially after just trying some of his advice my klout score went from 30 to 62 in a little over 24 hours, my friend list on FB added like 50 ppl and my blog following tripled. And not with other writers but with actual readers! As you can see it really excites me that I found this book and I HIGHLY recommend it as a MUST read for all writers! EVEN if you arent planning to self publish, believe me the publishing houses do not market for you like they used to and never will again, you will still need to put much of his strategy to work so you can sell books!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The cover is a perfect fit for the kindle fire. I dropped it once and keep it protected. Just fold the flap and start reading, surfing, watching, etc.
B006M3JVD6|4.0|I love hearing straight from the hoarses mouth their count of what happened along with the emotional ups and downs.  But most. Of all the courage to put pen to paper. Thankk you
B005K17RU0|3.0|Good information but annoying that I couldn't seem to find out how to view it in landscape format. Otherwise good presentation.
B001R0XNSI|5.0|Great product, solid well made fist weapon all balistic plastic and an actual working marker. Really its a marker how can anyone fault that? I just wish Coldsteel made it with the classic colored body. Fits in shirt pocket, front pocket, and back pocket quite comfortably. Great for loading the hand and using it as prescribed by Filipino weapon systems. I have a large sized hand and the marker has enough plastic sticking out of my fist on both ends for a variety of techniques.
0060574216|4.0|I'm not a self-help reader.  I ran across this book by accident.  And I was just curious, didn't think it would mean anything to me because I was in a same-sex relationship.  I mainly was thinking \\"oh joy, let's see how sexist all of this is and laugh.\\"  But as I'm flipping through and picking up his basic points, I'm like \\"Woah, that sounds familiar!  So does that.  And that . . .\\"<br /><br />I realized that even though both of us were women, I am definitely from Mars, and Gloria was definitely from Venus.  I understood that one of our biggest difficulties and the cause of many hurtful fights was that we didn't understand (1) when each other needed \\"help,\\" and (2) what kind of \\"help\\" they needed.  The role of non-verbal communication was extremely important too.  Gloria didn't read the book, but I gradually talked to her about many of the ideas in it, and she found them helpful too.  We understood each other much better and were able to defuse miscommunications before they turned into full-out fights.<br /><br />You'll most likely be turned off by the author's jargon and style if you're not steeped in self-help-ese.  Flip through it and get the main points.  It's worth a shot.
B004GYY714|4.0|worked great but not all stations in Houston area would work, would tranfer me to a similar station else where.

Instead of[...] and find the card (RDF1). Alternatively, go directly to the download page at: [...]Detail    Notes:   1. The driver installation requires a restart.   2.

B007P6VM04|4.0|While this has become my favorite show and I can't wait for each episode, I was so disappointed that the album didn't include the fabulous \\"Howl\\" song, that was sung at the Joe Jonas character's birthday party, and the beautiful 51st Street sung at the investor's preview.  Sadly they chose to give us the dismal \\"Everything's Coming Up Roses\\" by Bernadette Peters and the useless \\"September Song\\" by Anjelica Houston.  I do however particularly love \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\" and \\"History Is Made At Night.\\"  Maybe they are planning on releasing a \\"Bombshell\\" soundtrack after the season has ended.  So, while I love parts of this album, there are parts that I truly hate.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Watch out you young wippersnappers us old folks are still alive and capable of kicking butt. Theres a lot that could be learned by the younger generations if they'd just get to know and listen to what their grandparents could tell you. All the high teck stuff is wonderful but the old ways are too.
0345803485|5.0|This was an awesome book and I enjoyed reading it thoroughly - my only complaint is too many darn reference to her inner goddess. I know we all have one but I don't listen to mine to that extent - otherwise sheer, adult, sexy perfection!!!! Bravo!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app! I definitely do not have an elephant's memory and this helps me with work, home and life by keeping everything in one place. NO MORE LOST STICKY NOTES!!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I was happy to see it for kindle. but when trying to open it would let me loving to facebook but wouldn't open up the game I am disappointed
B004WR125O|5.0|This is about as easy as it gets. Plug it in and away you go. Great reception, installed a month ago and have had no issues at all streaming from the internet, Netflix, my media server and the PS3.
B007B6VOG0|3.0|Can't listen to it without thinking it's from some Broadway show or musical movie. It's OK. Lots of wailing from the lead, but it all sounds the same, and I just keep seeing the show on Broadway in my mind as he wails and I can't get past that.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Great movie. There's so much you can take away from this movie. The DVD extras provide a lot of info about the movie and the history it covers.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I love this game, it is easy to follow, have not used any cheats as I am able to figure it out. Love the puzzles and when I am not able to figure them out , there is a skip button so I am never stuck. Hope there are more games like this one
0385342063|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has done it again. This book is great, I could NOT put it down. I loved the story line and characters. It was interesting and kept me want to keep reading until the very end. It was a little predictable in the end but still enjoyable reading. I have to say, Sophie Kinsella is becoming my #1 favorite \\"chick lit\\" author by far.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I think it is boring. there are also so many sales about &quot;gems&quot; . they buy. you speacial things. add pop don't buy the game.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I like this game a lot but when I try to play it, the game makes a dong sound when I hit start on the game and wont let me play!! :( please tell me why.
0062082353|2.0|I have read several of the current sniper books that have come out in the last six months. This book while interesting did not provide the detail nor develop any interest in the plot line like the other authors.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool 5 completes a well-developed story arc with ample room for more stories (prequels, sequels, and side stories) to satisfy the longing fans have shown and come to expect from this unique and intriguing post-apocalyptic series of novellas. While the \\"Wool Omnibus\\" provides readers with a complete reading experience, it is not a traditionally structured novel. It started out as a single short story and developed into a serial experience. Keep that in mind if you decide to read all five stories in a short amount of time (it will help explain why the main protagonist doesn't appear until well into the story arc).<br /><br />That being said, the series comes highly recommended from this particular reader for both it's strong characters, tight-knit (pun intended) plot, and reflective (but well-paced and action-filled) writing. A few years ago I read Howey's debut novel, Molly Fyde, and enjoyed it - I was impressed with how solid a writer he was then. With Wool, Howey has shown that serious writers can develop their craft and that it's worth revisiting them (or sticking with them) as they release new material. I'll be keeping up with Wool, that's for sure. If Hugh keeps writing installments, I'll keep following the storyline probably forever.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Like all music from heavy metal to classical, but this album shines to the top as far as listening pleasure. Everything was developed perfectly.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm not going to write a thorough review. The movie is awesome, and I wan't to buy the Blu-ray as soon as possible. Highly recommend it, especially if you're thinking of watching this on IMAX 3D.
0446581356|3.0|In a nutshell, she is only trying to sell her makeup line. She gives good advice about breaking into the business, but if you are a makeup artist like me and are looking for tips, don't waste your time buying this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I figured out how to exit without shutting the kindle down once. this is not the only game I have seen where you have to enter the game menu to get the kindle bar back. the game itself is great fun.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Even though Disney proclaimed it a box-office failure in US, this is the best sci-fi/fantasy movie I have ever seen, compared only to [[ASIN:B00003CXDD Willow]] and [[ASIN:B003WJ81MA Legend]]. It was accepted much better in Europe and the rest of the world. The story and the cinematography were fantastic; the special effects were spectacular and the acting was impeccable. Hence, millions of viewers still love it, no matter the 'movie politics,' which aren't always fair to the cast and the fans. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family, for it is packed with action/adventure and has a very strong message. Superb quality: five stars!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|i liked the the game but only two levels the last level was missing 2 stars and no way to upgrade
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I do wish that they didn't have the option to use real $ to buy acorns.  Its real easy for kids to click an buy. if you dont have enough coins or acorns that you've earned n the game to get a house or animal or land...a screen lets you know that you need more an then asks if you'd like to buy some (using real money) Of course the young kids def want to so they click yes an then it purchases it using your amazon Acct.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I've started my own business and was recommended this book by my instructor. It is a really good book for the 'lay' business person like me! It really tells you how to think about working in your business and not for it. Very good information! I would recommend this book!
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|the gyro controls didn't work for my fire... graphics are bland and mission are boring. also the ranking system is really messed up... I finished the first level in 20 seconds and still only got one out of three stars.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it works well on my kindle fire I had no problem so far. a very not bore game for those free days on ur hands and that u might want to have fun :)
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|great game but got sick of the unreasonable times till profit.  seems like if I shut down the kindle completely it woulddo this.  I currently have 183 hours till proffit on half my buildings. so I'm removing the app
0694013013|5.0|Ever since I bought this book my two kids have requested it to be read to them every night, they know and do all the actions - turning heads, stomping feet and wriggling toes etc..., Definitely a favourite with my toddlers.
0061777269|5.0|I have been reading different books on Near Death Experience phenomena. I have obtained a considerable amount of information on this topic. I may say that Consciousness Beyond Life is the most informative,rigorous,and profound treatise I ever read before on this subject. This book goes beyond the boundaries of a mere informative work. It is scientifically solid, with unusual considerations and reasonings not found in other books on this matter. The NDE events are analyzed in full details with clarifying insights not found in the current literature. A whole chapter is devoted to expose the possible explanations quantum physics may provide to explain the existence of consciousness after life. I strongly recommend this book to all those people interested in rigorous approaches to the nowadays common NDE events.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had no intentions for reading the book. I received the sample of Hunger Games,and read and loved all three books
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Do not waste your money on this book, I could find better things to spend $10 on and so can you, trust me!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is about eye-hand co-ordination and is challenging and fun.  It has fun layers to conquer at each level.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The writing style of the author was superb. The descriptive adjectives used to describe the characters or events were most intriguing, to the extent that I had to look up some specific  terms to assertain the meaning.  I have never had to do this while reading a book. The books characters and their personalities (Ana Steel and Chritian Grey)kept my attention, so much so, until I did not want to stop reading at night.  The most enjoyable parts (LOL parts) of the book were the subcharacters of Ana Steel's subconscious and her inner godness, the characters were the best ever. I would be remiss if I said that the descriptive sexual encounters were some of the best that I have ever read. Amazon.com (Kindle) is the best way to get your reading materials immediately.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is a very interesting and addictive game.  you just can't stop playing once you start it.  I am now moving on to level 40.
B002WTOXUK|4.0|This movie starts as some sort of video account of a UN style organization dealing with the relocation of over one million aliens. It is gritty and far more realistic in scope than any other alien film (i.e Independence Day).<br /><br />The movie is so many things at once. Heart wrenching, poignant, and a real look at how we as a culture can become so elitist. This is our history doomed to be repeated as the aliens are relegated to a lesser status because \\"we\\" don't understand them. It also shows how the heart can change,
B002SRQ214|5.0|This was for a new build of mine that I put together from some old parts but mostly new.<br /><br />I knew I had to change the cpu because my old one was an Athlon super slow and a crazy amount of lag.<br /><br />Put this baby in and even on stock cooling I was able to overclock it to 4.0GHz with a voltage of 1.42. THAT IS INSANE !!!<br /><br />Under stress test for 6 hours not one hiccup.<br /><br />Once I put in the aftermarket cooler I will try to get it higher.<br /><br />JUST AMAZING BUY IT YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The title is just my acronym of what this movie meant to be in an nutshell. This is the most *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* *beep* movie EVER! They're is not enough adjectives in any language to describe how AHHH! this movie is! Avengers jolted my soul and breathed fire into my lungs with action and laughter. Instance Watch, Instance Buy, Instance Love. Never have I laughed and cheered so much in an action film, Marvel ( Stan Lee) you created greatness to an omega scale. I just can't wait for another EXPERIENCE like that. AVENGERS FTW! AVENGERS ASSEMBLE ! To not see is crime that i might not be able to save you from but i will sure avenge you ! Cheesy i know , but all in all this is the best movie I have ever seen for a long time and probably for a long time to come ( that until the sequel maybe)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|By far my favorite Bible app!  I love the ease of switching back and forth between translations. I all enjoy the note taking ability.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so addictive! ! other than the ads which I don't care about because all you have to do is push the back button everything is awesome!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I found this movie (albeit somewhat corny) to have all the qualities of a great story line - makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you want to go out and change the world, makes you think. All in all, the writers and actors did a pretty good job. I would strongly suggest families making this the choice for their next family movie night. It portrays men/fathers as role models and in a positive light, which is unusual in most movies nowadays.
0307956350|2.0|I listened to this on CD in my car and found myself being lulled into sleep, a dangerous place when you're driving. Although Mozhan Marno's professional voice tries her best to read the novel as inhabiting the characters, the novel never comes alive. I'm with everyone of the one and two-star reviews: the characters aren't believable, the story takes too long to develop, and I cannot believe that Kate was ever CIA or killed anyone. I actually was shouting at the CD. \\"NO way!\\" She relentlessly folds clothes and meanders around. The mysterious couple they befriend? Come on! If Kate were CIA, she would know they're not who they say they are, even before she does research on them.<br />Sorry to those who say Pavone is a good writer. Most of this tells episodes in flashback, then the action scenes are dull, the dialogue \\"on-the-nose.\\"<br />I noticed that one of the reviews states that Pavone is married to an editor at a publishing house?<br />And please don't compare him to Le Carr&eacute;.<br />Another good marketing job, selling exotic locales.
0385340540|2.0|Dull.  the mid-100, or so, pages of the book are involved with the protagonist learning Italian.  I learned several new words.  The one Italian word I wish I'd learned was \\"Boring\\".  The book is a journy from nowhere to nowhere, via the scenic route.  The character of the protagonist changes completely, without an acceptable reason.  The story moves with the speed of a legal brief in a patent infringement action.  Yep, you're right.  I really thought it was a waste of my time and money.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|The processor works great.  I paired it with the Gigabyte z77 MX-D3h motherboard and the ZALMAN CNPS8000B CPU cooler.  Everything is working great together.  CPU temps are 31-32 C without load and 52-53 C at full load.  I have no problem with core heat but I am running everything at stock with aftermarket cooler. The Zalman is nice and quiet but the Intel Stock cooler is noisy.  Had to take one star off for that.  Now, I could easily overclock because I have a lot of thermal headroom but why?  The CPU has plenty of power for what I need.  The graphics on this Ivy bridge CPU are no joke.  This is the first time I have seen this kind of quality video on a stock chipset.  Unless you do gaming you certainly could get by on this.  I have a  video card on order but I am happy with the graphics I have right now.  The pricing has been all over the map with this CPU.  I grabbed it the day is launched and paid up for it.  Now you can get it a lot cheaper.  If you want an inexpensive build, forget AMD. Go with this and and you can skip buying a video card which will save you money.  I am very happy with the CPU.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I actually haven't read the book yet but if it is anything like the movie, it will be a MUST READ!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome!!!!!!!!!!! such a great game soooooo awesome awesome awesome la la la lu la la dun da dun da dun dun dudu dun
B007V2UGPE|2.0|I played this game briefly then stoped playing for awhile.  I'll admit I didn't play it enough to see whether the game was good or not, but I was completely turned off by the fact that it kept popping up in mg notifications, prompting me to play it again.

B003O86FMW|5.0|A great second book in this series.  It was almost as good as the first one, Hunger Games.  I could not put it down.  Each turning page screamed for me to read more.  3 books in 1 week should tell you something.

0345803485|1.0|Seriously? This is what everyone is talking about?  Not worth the time or money.  Ana starts out as an interesting and off-beat female heroine but by the time she loses her virginity to Christian I am turned off.  I expect more of the female protagonist.
B0000524CY|3.0|This was okay. It wasn't that scary. First time watching. I thought it would be more scarier. It was really boring with all the talking going on. Might return...
B005LAIGN2|3.0|I hesitate to write what I really think of this movie as it seems to be so popular, but I do want to give my opinion.<br /><br />This film starts off unbelievable from the very start.  I was shocked at the horrible dialog of the B-17 crews.  Were they reading it off of cue cards?  No emotion.  No fear.  It's like the makers of this film had never seen \\"12 O'Clock High\\", \\"The War Lover\\", \\"Battle of Britain\\", \\"Memphis Belle\\" or even the short but emotional fighter scenes from \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  Did anyone else notice these pilots NEVER used their goggles?  Even the pilot who had fuel pouring into his cockpit didn't use his goggles.  Ridiculous!<br /><br />Then the CG.  If I'm not mistaken, I think the jeeps in the film were real, and a plane here and there.  The CG was overused and too obvious.<br /><br />The music score, IMO, was just weird.  I don't think it flowed at all.<br /><br />The acting was just ok.  There were some good action sequences.  Personally, I think that German pilot did his part better than anyone.<br /><br />Lastly, I was actually expecting a cameo appearance by Bruce Willis and Steve McQueen.  Could they have come any closer to copying the POW scenes from \\"Hart's War\\" and \\"The Great Escape\\"?  Can no one in Hollywood have an original thought these days?<br /><br />Overall, a fair war movie.  Better acting would have made a major improvement.

0887306667|5.0|Justin Thole's July 13, 2011 review states the 22 laws very well.<br /><br />Here are a few quotes from this outstanding book that should be required reading for the marketing major.<br /><br />\\"One reason the 1st brand tens to maintain its leadership is that the name often becomes generic.\\" They use the examples of Xerox when making a copy, asking for a Kleenex when the box says Scott, and offering you a Coke when all they have is Pepsi. Same w/ Band Aids, Jello, Krazy Glue, Qtips and Saran Wrap.<br /><br />\\"Not only does the 1st brand usually become the leader, but also the sales order of follow up brands often matches the order of their introductions.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everyone is interested in what's new. Few people are interested in what's better.\\"<br /><br />\\"You want to change something in a mind? Forget it. Once a mind is made up, it rarely, if ever, changes. The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is to try to change a mind.\\"<br /><br />\\"Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two.\\"<br /><br />This is a quick & extremely worthwhile read and am very glad that I did.

0061122416|5.0|It would be easier for me to turn words into gold, than to \\"review\\" \\"The Alchemist\\".  How does one capture a soul in words?<br />I owe a deep debt of gratitude to George Donaldson (singer, \\"The White Rose\\")  for putting this book into my hands (and heart).  It is one of those rare treasures that has made me a better person for the reading of it.<br />I'd call that alchemy.

Not only are the dust jackets attractive, but the hardcover itself is very handsome if you prefer to remove your dust jackets.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is the sort of dystopian fiction that, if not the equal of A Brave New World and 1984, I think we secure a place in the pantheon of enduring dystopian fiction.  It is very much a product of our times, most notably regarding our fears about reality TV and genetic engineering and our pessimism toward political alternatives, but it also taps into timeless American values and pathologies, most notably our obsession with our parallels to the Roman Empire.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is the story of a young woman, Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers to fight to the death against 23 other teenagers from the outlying districts of her authoritarian country in order to save her 12-year-old sister (selected by lottery).  And it is all televised by the Capitol as a propaganda tool to keep the outlying districts beaten-down.  Almost entirely by accident she becomes the symbol of a revolution.<br /><br />There is a much bigger story going on, particularly in the second and third book, than what is happening to Katniss, but this is very much her story.  It is told entirely from her perspective.  This forces the reader to do much of the heavy thinking about why things are as they are and are happening as they are.  Seeing things through the eyes of a teenager drives in the horror of it all.<br /><br />Aimed at a YA audience, The Hunger Games trilogy is written in clean, simple English (which is no criticism), and the books are short (even shorter than they look, a large font and ample white space are used for the boxed set).  The trilogy sells a single, integrated story, with each volume building off the last and each with a satisfying (if not definitive) conclusion.  The conclusion of the final volume I think nicely wraps up the entire series.  The first volume, The Hunger Games, is easily the strongest of the two, but Catching Fire and Mockingjay are also very good.e, The Hunger Games, is easily the strongest of the two, but Catching Fire and Mockingjay are also very good.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|In 1972, Lenny Kaye and Jac Holzman released the first \\"Nuggets\\" double album.  It consisted of what we now refer to today as garage rock--most of the songs were by mid-Sixties bands who were all but forgotten a few years later, but who had one or two really good songs worth preserving for posterity.<br /><br />The album sold widely among those who were big fans of the genre, and twenty-six years later Rhino Records revisited the material by releasing this four-disc, 118-song boxed set.  The 27 songs on the original album comprise the first disc, with 91 other selections rounding out the other three.  All songs are by American bands.<br /><br />Rhino did an outstanding job with this set--there is a booklet included that contains essays on the music, its history, and its place in the history of rock.  There is also information on each song on the set, such as the band personnel, where the song was recorded, when it was released, and any applicable chart information.  There is a paragraph or two telling the story of each song, and a picture of the band in many cases.<br /><br />Even if you love Sixties garage rock, chances are much of what is here will be unfamiliar to you when you first hear the set, which means that you'll find a dozen or so songs that you'll like as much as any others you liked before in the genre.  \\"Nuggets\\" is a must-own for big fans of Sixties garage rock.
B007BRJYF2|3.0|I really want to like this game because the graphics are great but I hate when there are no hints on a game. I can't find the 4th pink flamingo despite opening EVERY door 6 times and writing the locations down, there are only 3 and I can't find a \\"hint\\" button so I have let some words fly several times for what is supposed to be a relaxing game has just stressed me out!! help from anyone would be appreciated. Obviously, I am missing something...sometimes common sense is lost on me for book sense. Great graphics though and I do love Lewis Carroll! duh... ok somehow I just missed it... got it now! yay for me... duh

B007HO392S|5.0|no doubt about good girl is right, best albumn, beautiful girl love to hear Carrie sing any where any time
B0072X2O66|4.0|This album is not for everyone. The music seems to be a mix of styles with a heavy metal (almost thrash metal) quality to many tracks like Undaunted, and Freight Train. Other songs have a more pop/hair metal sound. All On the Line seems to be inspired by Triumph's Lay it on the Line lyrically, while emulating Flying Colors or 90s Deep Purple musically. Come Undone is a cover of Duran Duran and sounds like a pop metal song from the 80s.<br />I was introduced to the band by watching a youtube video of Undaunted. The band plays with a great deal of energy in the video and that is also evident in the album. If you like headbanging heavy metal you might like it. Some of the songs are great, but overall it is nothing outstanding. Definitely worth it for heavy metal fans.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|It's a great non conventional out of the box thinking book with fresh and real ideas. It is intended for new or small businesses but for me it can also be applied for big corporations to face reality on how the world works and not only big corporations. For me this is a must read book and also can be used as a reference guide by topic.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I am a fan of defense games. this one has great graphics and gameplay. controls are good. you are a samurai who can move left and right. you attack automatically with your sword when close and bow and arrow when further away. you have units you can deploy to help fight off the incoming waves of zombies. this game is similar to the army of darkness defense game and Garfield defense, but I think this one is superior, without the need for $.
B004I744AS|5.0|A little bit of everything!  I read &amp; play it every night before falling asleep. Love it especially all the word games.

B007JRU2UK|5.0|In the tradition of \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\" and \\"Ordinary People,\\" \\"The Descendants\\" is a high-toned social drama centered around the complex dynamics of familial relationships. Like those other films, it also won wide critical praise and a boatload of award nominations the year it was released.<br /><br />Matt King is a wealthy, workaholic businessman living in Hawaii with his wife and two daughters, the older of whom is a rebellious teen who's recently been shipped off to boarding school on another island. As the movie opens, we learn that Matt's world has begun to crash in on him big time as his wife lies in a coma brought on by a boating accident. Matt struggles not only with the guilt of having been an emotionally distant husband but with raising two precocious and challenging children, who are deep in the throes of typical growing pains and whom he barely seems to know at this point. He also has to deal with the complications of selling some of the valuable property he inherited from his wealthy ancestors to developers who may not be as attuned as he is to the natural beauty and ecological richness of the land.<br /><br />With a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by Nat Faxon, Jim Rash and director Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the movie neatly sidesteps all the potential melodrama inherent in the material. The plot constantly wanders off onto interesting and unexpected bypaths, and characters who seem as if they could become easily pigeonholed refuse to do or say what we expect them to do or say. No one is a hero or a villain; they're all just ordinary folks trying to lead decent lives, though often falling far short of that mark, as we all do. Indeed, there is an air of verisimilitude to this film that is a rare commodity in modern commercial moviemaking. At every moment, we feel as if are watching real people acting in real ways - just as if actual life were unfolding before us. In fact, there is not a single false moment to be found anywhere in the film.<br /><br />This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect. Ditto for Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play his two daughters with unerring believability and conviction. Their interactions with one another are indeed a wonder to behold.<br /><br />With admirable restraint, director Alexander Payne is content to let the drama speak for itself. He has the decency to pull back and give the characters their space without feeling it necessary to push his points or exploit the audience's emotions. Yet, there is a lovely, hypnotic flow to the movie that draws us into both the tropical setting (how many movies set in Hawaii are about people who actually live there?) and the lives of these ordinary people who are suffering through an extraordinary - yet, at the same time, utterly universal - ordeal.<br /><br />A human drama that is as intimate as it is epic, \\"The Descendants\\" is one of the most profound and moving film-going experiences of recent years.und anywhere in the film.<br /><br />This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is not Edward but Edward's wife writing this review.......When I began the first book I wanted so much to like the series but it became very monotonous very quickly. I did complete the series but that was due to my ocd and wanting to be able to speak about it. I think this book received way to much hype and it seemed to be repetitive in its storyline(at least sexually). I wanted so bad to like it but it ended up being just ok to me. I found myself skipping parts just so I could hurry through it....
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|If you like hidden object games but they all seem repetitive then this game is for you.  It changes things up to keep it interesting.  I also like that what you are looking for is possible to see.  some other games hide dark objects against dark backgrounds and they are impossible to see.  Only patrway through so far but it seems to have a good storyline and interesting characters as well. Overall a great game.
0440242401|5.0|I love Sophie kinsella, I read remember me in one day, as I am the type of person if I don't like a book I won't  read it and have to say if you like me and it's a cold day outside and want to stay in bed and read a book that will keep you there. This is a book for you
030771652X|5.0|This literary mystery has more murder suspects than a game of Clue.  Still, the police insist that Tess's death was a suicide.  In the meantime, her sister Beatrice puts herself in harm's way, as she becomes obsessed with identifying Tess's killer.  Beatrice loses credibility with the police when she finds that too many of Tess's male acquaintances had a motive for doing her in.  First, there's her married lover and tutor, who tried to squelch the scandal of Tess's pregnancy.  Then there's the son of a prominent politician who had a huge, unhealthy crush on Tess and stalked her with his camera.  Finally, there's the shady medical trial of an in utero gene therapy that was supposed to cure Tess's unborn child of cystic fibrosis, but the baby was stillborn, due to an unrelated issue.  A need to expunge her own guilt, as well as a thirst for justice, drives Beatrice's quest.  Beatrice finds that she has not been the model sister and daughter that she thought herself to be, and now it is too late to make amends with Tess.  Tess, however, was a free spirit who, if she were alive, would tell Beatrice that there is nothing to forgive.  Tess gave completely of herself, while expecting nothing in return.  This book succeeds on a literary level because of its treatment of the bond between the two sisters that persists even after one has died.  However, I don't have a sister, and for me, the twists and turns and wide array of villains, one of whom must be the murderer, were what kept me reading.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It tests logic and creativity. This game is good for all ages! Soothing, challenging and addictive. The design is beautiful. in its simplicity.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm a Mobile DJ that travels from club to club, gig to gig.  I've used Headphones that go for 400.00 to ones that cost 10.00.  The've all broken the same after about 8 months of heavy use.  I'd keep spending money on them though because they were labeled for \\"DJ Use.\\"  Honestly it's all marketing bs for companies to get people to buy their products.  I remember the days when expensive prices actually meant that something was going to last a lot longer.  Not the case with most head phones on the market today.<br /><br />These Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone's have with stood the test of time over and over again (if it ain't broke don't fix it).<br /><br />During school I worked at the college radio station and all we used were these Sony's.  I'd nearly forgotten how bad we used to treat them; they took such a beating that I thought all headphones were built this way.  Not the case.  The only thing I was see going on these is the ear pads (which are replaceable.  As much as I use these, the way I take care of my equipment, I won't be needing to replace the ear pads for the next two years).<br /><br />When I bought them last year there were something like 82.00.  Very much worth the price even at 98.00.  To this day if you ask me what are the best head phones to DJ with I will tell you to get these.  They are also amazing for the Studio as well.  Go figure.<br /><br />Update: 10/14/12<br />Just replaced my my ear pieces as they were tearing on the inside and had this weird flaking issue.  The foam pieces I replaced them with are excellent (Pearstone delux ear pads), have used them for the past three days with no issue; and def no flaking (which only starts to happen with the originals after a year or two depending on use).<br /><br />The only weakness these headphones possess is the foam ear pieces which are not as durable as the Pearstone's I just purchased.  I recommend buying the Pearstone Delux earpads (they go for around 20.00) along with the MDR-7506.  You will not be disappointed.DR-7506.  You will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome although you have to beat other minigames to get coins and that can take awhile but other than that cool
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book was recommended to me and I enjoyed it.  The book was an easy read and contained drama and was well written
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Don't let the title or the photos deter you from the book. From the looks I was leery on getting it because I'm not a huge fan of \\"dark\\" stories. But Miss Peregrine's is anything but \\"dark\\" (like the Monstrumologist Series). It is a story of life, growing up and having peculiar events happen in the main character's life. It is a great short read (It took me two days to read) and I can't wait for the sequel!!!
B004OFWLO0|5.0|I have previously owned his complete recordings offering from Sony but had one major complaint: the alternates come directly after the song. So you'd hear the same song twice, which for me gets unbelievably boring fast. Luckily with this collection they fixed that problem. Secondly, the sound quality is better. Some tracks have a hiss, and some they seemed to really be able to remove all of it. The guitar and singing sounds upfront and almost as if it was recorded in someones house with cheap equipment today. Surprisingly it really makes it more personal, and not like it was just a \\"recorded\\" song. I definitely recommend this collection, and the liner notes have a bunch of pictures of his disciples and players of his day. Definitely check this one out if you haven't a good collection or just want another.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Loved this book, I read it in one night as I couldn't put it down. I have since bought the trilogy and read them over the three nights I bought them.  I love Christian he's completely beautiful and Ana is just what he needs :)
B0077SGMXM|4.0|It's an excellent game but consumes battery and communicates in background. The courses should be added. Power ups is a good feature.

0553801473|2.0|This book (and the last) were a drag. This author needs some serious editing! Seems like he is getting lost in the descriptive part of the narrative and the thrust and direction are too diluted by far. Also, we are running out of original protagonists, and I find myself becoming detached from the characters. There are only two I care about any more, and it is getting hard to wade through pages and pages of descriptive nothingness to keep up with them. Not sure I will continue with the series. I feel kind of abused!
B003EV6DBW|1.0|The Frame Rate is just so bad, I can't even describe it, almost as if it's just a little too slow. I've probably waited too long to return them and I'm scared to purchase replacements - out of 3 blu-ray sets of Doctor Who I've purchased (Tennant Goodbye specials, season 5 & 6, all have this frame rate issue.
B003E6K1VK|3.0|I bought this product based on its Amazon review, but was disappointed after used it for 1 day.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|its a fine app, and usually runs great, but it slowed down my kindle. I'm not sure if its because it free or because it takes up to much memory or what.... but I uninstalled it. it just wasn't worth it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I understand what everyone is saying about the writing not being the greatest. However, that being said this is one of the most captivating series' of books I have ever read . Christian is so different and intriguing that you can't stop reading. I read all three books in 4 days. Loved them and now am finding myself wondering what I can read now that will measure up. Try them, they will not disappoint!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|pretty cool game, though its more life Sims mobile or farmville than Oregon trail. fun to play for free for a while, but eventually you pay or you grind levels for weeks.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A simple and yet highly addictive game, creative and full of laughs. The sounds and scenes are amazing and each of the progressive birds are amazing. You quickly find your favorites and the ones you realy prefer, then the program changes a bit and they are not quite as strong, or usueful for that particular round. The game certainly teaches you patience, in the beginning you can not move on until you have mastered the scene. It is fun and frivilous, and certainly seems innocuous, yet be aware, it will become very addictive in a short time. Something so simple, and yet so frustrating and fun.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book must surely become a pivotal work on NDEs and advance thinking on spirituality generally because Anita provides an immensely readable and credible account of her out of body experience that basically blows much previously written work out of the water. Her story beautifully describes her experience of her infinite self, which in turn fits seamlessly into the work of Wayne Dyer and others. There is no judgement, just love and we are all one. After reading this book, (and I read it blissfully every night, slowly digesting its contents) I fell ill for a month and have since come to understand that my body was simply healing itself, bringing unresolved emotional issues up, which once resolved, simultanelously resolved the illness too. Wow............powerful stuff for sure.
B007IE4DSG|3.0|I loved this one but to tell you truth, it was way too short for a CD, I mean only 10 tracks on it with it being called \\"Vol 1\\"? Very disappointed in the total time of this one. The Music a 5, the total time a \\"Big\\" 0. So are the next volumes all going to have some great material on it but short as well? Come on, we are in the digital age, what gives? More money to be made? I'd say yes to that statement.<br />Check out my Website sometime @ JudeMac Forever & Say \\"Hi\\"
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This isn't bad for a summer big action film. It has a good fast pace, a simple story and a sense of humor about itself. The action is very creative and, as expected, Robert Downey Jr steals the show. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job in a rather subdued role. The Harry Dean Stanton cameo was very well done and shows that he still has it as a character actor.<br /><br />The bits with Scarlett Johansson were creative and fun. They turned the usual \\"weak hero getting lectured by the villian\\" bit on its head. That sort of thing is the best method for putting a heroic character over in a film. The villian gets his bluster lines, but then is shown to have been outsmarted and ends up looking foolish. Few films (for decades) have managed to get that simple thing right. The actors playing Thor and Captain America also did a good job. The bit with Loki in Europe established the Captain America character in a good way in a short amount of film time and avoided what could have been the annoying aspects of a lecturing patriotic character. Thor was all about the action as it should have been. They managed to figure out a way to make the Hawkeye character (an archer) actually work. The bits with the bow as a close-up weapon were a great idea.<br /><br />The things that don't work so well:<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury however doesn't work. There is too much of him and I dont know that using him to bring the group together in the story was necessary. It would have been better for him to be more incidental than constantly at the core of things. The whole the-government-can't-be-trusted subplot was a predictable waste of time.<br /><br />They spent too much time with followup characters from previous films. It didn't add much of anything really.<br /><br />The alien invasion characters were all rather bland and cookie cutter looking. Making everything grey chrome and mostly identical was a rather odd choice. It got to a point where it seemed like there were two CGI models that they just kept using over and over again. It might have been better to give some of the aliens more of a personality rather than having them be bugs squashed one after the other.<br /><br />Five stars within its genre. Its a well done example of this sort of film. Mindless entertainment has its place I guess.
B005HSL626|5.0|I had heard about this game from a little kid. I ended up asking that kid about 100 times when it was my turn to play. Super cool! I seriously stayed up all night playing this, I know weird. But anyway , great game the graphics are almost like 3d.
0553801473|5.0|The action in \\"A Dance With Dragons,\\" following on \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" sets the stage for a joining of Westeros's north and south, all contenders in both aiming, as ever, to bring the continent into some kind of unity after years of vicious civil war. It's an amazing read that you just can't put down I'll say that for sure. Another astounding read you will have too wrap your eyes around is [[ASIN:B007QFX2DO Nekhet (Dreamline)]] simply wonderful, a real page turner. Just don't take my word for it get your copy here on amazon.

0312427646|5.0|Are you ever at a cocktail party where people are talking about sports or celebrities or TV shows when you just wanted to burst out, \\"Read, people.  If you read, your world gets bigger and much more interesting!\\"  I haven't, But Alan Bennett assuredly has.<br /><br />The Queen, nearly 80, more or less accidentally checks out a book from a mobile library, and checks out (as is, removes from the premises)  a young reader named Norman at the the same time. Norman, generally unimpressed by monarchy, becomes her guide to reading things she never read before.  To her amazement, and the alarm of her Staff, she loves it. It changes her.<br /><br />OK, that's the plot.<br /><br />This is a delightful, very brief, very funny argument in favor of reading. As you are unlikely to be reading this review if you are not a reader, you should be hooked already.  Bennett takes shots at the stuffy Staff, authors, shallow lives (exemplified by the poor Queen's responsibilities to preside over --but otherwise not participate in --  the openings of  new factories, parks and, way back when, countries), bureaucratic decisions and any number of other light subjects.  But he is serious in his support for the benefits of reading.  This book is the justification for all the time we have 'wasted' consuming books and even occasionally thinking about what we read.  I wanted to rise up, join the club and have an armband as I read it.<br /><br />This is, at best, a two or three hour book.  It is so slim that the cost per word is sort of high.  But it is so much fun, and so supportive of your addiction to books, that it is nearly disloyal to not read it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game!! Just wish I didn't have to use my money to purchase cash in the game. But other than that, this game fun! :)

B0043X1FL8|4.0|In the Awakening, we see what a blessing it is to be alive--to be able to wake up in the morning, brush our teeth, and even comb our hair.<br /><br />The patients in this movie are alive but they are not. Then they receive the gift of life, for a time. I left this movie with a deep sense of thankfulness for being a non-disabled (i.e., able) person, free to live my few years on earth without much physical impediment. As there is nothing that's holding me back (except my laziness and other sins), I owe it to myself and God to live with all my might, while I do live.<br /><br />I suppose dying (as one gets older and his physical ability dies slowly long before the last breath) is somewhat like what the patients experienced in this movie. It is a cruel thing, and there is nothing noble about it.<br /><br />A very moving scene: Robert De Niro, as the symptoms (tic) come back and start to gain control over body, fears what is coming and says, \\"This is not me!\\" What a misery it is when I do things that I don't want to do, but there seems to be some force (inside me) that makes me do it!

Words like banal and trite come to mind, but they seem a bit too harsh. There's just something missing on this album, which is very hard to articulate with words. All I can say is I know it when I hear it, and on this release I just ain't hearin' it.  Dear Jason, I hope you get your mojo back!

0811870413|5.0|This is a great book, and the bread is awesome. If you have been wanting to improve your bread making then this is the book for you. Chad lays it all out for you. It focuses on the country loaf and chapter 1 (64 pages) is devoted on how to make this loaf. Which is soo good!! The book is very well written and has loads of information in it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs Zombies is an awesome game that runs beautifully on the Motorola Xoom . It's worth playing through for the song that plays over the credits alone. It looks like all of those that have a problem have a Nexus. So, if you've got a Nexus, I suggest you buy it on PC or a console instead.
0788701398|5.0|Matilda<br />I would give this book Matilda five stars because it was a funny book. I think Roald Dahl's way of writing keeps you wanting to read more.<br /><br />Matilda's dad and mom are mean to her. Her dad calls her names like \\"idiot\\" and they don't pay attention to her intelligence . miss trunchbull is the headmistress she is t and  hates little kids she calls them brats. But miss honey loves kids and her job. Matilda scares her dad and miss trunchbull for being mean to her.<br /><br />I liked this book because it's a funny book. I like when Lavender puts the newt into Miss Trunchbull's water. I would recommend this book and Dahl's other books because his writing is creative.
1451627289|2.0|Or \\"harmonic\\". No matter how few pages you read each day, you'll be sloshed every time you put the book down, and maybe you won't notice the awful writing or the lack of editing.<br /><br />I've given the book 2 stars only because the plot that held such promise came through on a few occasions, and the opening chapters were interesting. But overall the writing was amateurish, sometimes embarrassingly so, and repetitive.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best romantic book series I have ever read! I couldn't put it down or stop thinking about it! If you like romantic series you will LOVE these books!!!

B0011UF79C|5.0|One of the greatest sleeper Sy-Fi movies, and certainly one of the most provocative is Gattaca.  The concept of genetic manipulation, while a thought back when this movie was made; is now more of a realization in our current society.  This movie does a wonderful job of exposing discrimination by the use of what is determined by your genes.  Furthermore, it also brings out the fear of altering ones genetic make-up to that of what parents \\"want\\" from their selected child.  Hawke is brilliant in the role...a very underrated actor whom I feel has never received his full due.  Law, in his first film role shows what he is and will be made of. Thurman handles her role with grace and elegance.  The remaining cast of well knowns are extraordinary.  Cinematography and \\"feel\\" of the film is almost a color version of \\"film noir\\".  even if you are not found of science fiction, this film is so well do, and so socially on target, it will mesmerize.  Only issue is that I have the Blu-Ray, which is 5.1 True HD sound.  Sony Pictures has not done a great job of sound quality...by that I mean you have to turn the volume up extremely loud to hear the movie.  Other True HD movies I have, even by Sony, this is not an issue.  This is the one flaw with the Blu-Ray.  It shold be noted the Blu-Ray does contain all the extras of the Deluxe Edition.  A must purchase film, with a top notch cast.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Um. No. No way. Mr. Riordan has left us with yet another one of his 'Rickhangers', and all of us are stuck waiting until next fall to find out what happens.<br /><br />Okay. Just to make this clear. Annabeth didn't die in the end! That's just bogus. It could never happen,  and if it ever did, the author is aware of the consequences, like maybe the fact that most fans will want to tear off his head.<br /><br />Oh, and the Annabeth-Percy reunion... Ooh. Percy is so sweet! They totally belong with each other. And then the thing that happens in the end- the horrible thing- what Percy did made me cry. Seriously. It was like the most noble thing ever. I don't think Harry Potter can compare. This is tooo much. But I'm not spoiling it.<br /><br />Personally, I think that in this book, Frank and Hazel didn't do much. Hazel was too busy trying to figure out why Leo looked so much like Sammy, and Frank was too busy glaring at Leo. Piper demonstrated her improved charmspeak, but other than that she spent most of the book worrying about Jason and his 'relationship' with Reyna.<br /><br />Other than that, this book was just awesome. The plot and the mythology was all interesting and riveting. I probably won't relax until fall next year. I'm so worried about Annabeth and Percy, and whether or not they'll survive. But they will. Obviously.<br /><br />By the way, Amazon's pre-ordering is way off. I received this book at 10pm October 1st, which I suppose is a good thing but then it's kinda off.<br /><br />So anyways, that's my tiny take on this wonderful book. It'd be longer, but spoilers just aren't nice in this case, right?<br /><br />-to be edited-<br /><br />danielle
014241011X|4.0|This is a good book but needed more.<br /><br />The story takes place mostly in a hotel in England. But starts off with a trip to<br /> Norway which is when the boy's family dies and he goes to live with his grand mother. But she just happens to know a great deal about witches. The boy's grand mother later becomes ill but gets better and takes a trip to England with the boy to a hotel. And that's when the adventure starts.<br /><br />This is a good book but I think it was too short and at the end they leave you at a huge cliff hanger. But this book did have a lot adventure that I liked.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Sylvia Day has brought two very complex character's together and has written a story that is so compelling and deep that you will not be able to put it down until the story is finished.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are two people who probably do not belong together. They both know it and are trying to find a way to make things work. Sparks fly when they meet; they are drawn together like fire and gasoline. The problem is, no matter how hard Gideon tries, Eva keeps running away. Both are very jealous and extremely possessive. Gideon has never truly committed to a woman and Eva's past has her feeling extremely vulnerable.<br /><br />There is no way to describe this book without spoilers. There are several hints as to what has transpired in both of their pasts. Eva's story comes out in Bared to You and you know that there was some kind of sexual molestation regarding Gideon in his past as well. I give Ms. Day a lot of credit for tackling not one, but two child molestation story lines. Then you bring in Cary, Eva's roommate who has his own past and problems, and things become extremely volatile. Gideon's family is probably a whole story in itself.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. There are so many back-stories that tie in with Gideon and Eva but it is in no way confusing. As the story progresses, you ask yourself a lot of questions. Why is Gideon trying so hard? Why isn't Eva trying to get him to open up more about his past with her (is she that self-centered)? How can their sex lives be so explosive (yes, they have extremely hot sex throughout this book) when they both have terrible pasts? Why won't Eva admit that she is a sexual submissive? You will not stop turning the pages in this book. You will be breathless and frustrated by the end and will want the story to continue. I actually yelled, \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\" when I turned the last page.<br /><br />Now, just one thing before I end this review. I have read other reviews of the book that are comparing this to Fifty Shades. Please stop! Mr. Cross and Mr. Gray may have similar backgrounds and MAY HAVE similar sexual problems but there is no way that you could compare the two books. Silvia Day has written a beautiful book filled with love, laughter and characters that draw you into their lives and have you hoping for the HEA. I cannot wait to see where it leads.<br /><br />Congratulations, Ms. Day on a wonderful book. Bared to You was a provocative and extremely erotic book filled with humor, suspense and love. I have not been drawn into a story or character's like Gideon and Eva in a very long time. I look forward to the second book in the Crossfire Series and cannot wait to see where you bring Gideon and Eva and what Gideon's story is.ng this to Fifty Shades. Please stop!

030788743X|5.0|A wonderful and exciting book.  All the references to the 80's were amazing, and the story is great.  I loved every word of it.  Definitely a great read for anyone interested in the 80s, video games, or computers.

0345803485|5.0|E L James is weaving her magic with the trilogy of the 50 Shades of Grey. All three were read within a two week period, with desperate searches for more on the subject. I loved the spin on \\"non-vanilla sex\\", very erotic and stimulating for the mind. Question, when will there be a forthcoming 4th book ? In the meantime I will start the re-read (smile). Mind you, it is not for the faint of sensitivity, some ladies will strongly object, I however, am in my search for \\"my\\" Christian.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I read all the reviews and it helped me make a decision to purchase this unit.  Build quality is very good.  Unit feels solid and all parts are a metal construction.  It looks very similar to a Merlin Steadicam minus the killer sticker price.  If imitation is a complement then this unit just stole your girlfriend took her to the prom and ran all the bases.<br /><br />Got to say I am impressed... for bang for buck Optika's stabilizer fly cam does the job and does it well!<br /><br />The gimbal does stick a little but that will probably loosen up with use and perhaps a little lubrication.  Taking the camera off and on can take a few minutes to rebalance but the controls are pretty self explanatory.  I had it in balance in less than 2 minutes.  Black knobs are for adjustments silver knobs are locking and the arm has a adjustment knob for larger adjustments.  most of the balance is done when setting the camera on the shoe.  remember to set your monitor in the position that you use it.  Changes in angle may require further adjustment.  And be sure the shoe is locked in place other wise your camera could go sliding off.<br /><br />I did a quick balance when setting the camera and then used the knobs.. the small black ones to dial it in.  If you can balance a marble on a piece of wood this will be easy... back knob is left and right adjust and left side knob is front to back micro adjustment...<br /><br />I would recommend!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great app. cant seem to put it down. lots of fun! I am progressing through the levels quickly

0375703764|4.0|I first got to know about THOL from a BBC Radio production, Primarily based around the Navidson film. ( a radioplay describing a movie - very THOL).<br />It is a fascinating book.  One of the great things about it is you have to read it as an actual physical book - this is completely un-eread-able.<br />Many of the conventions of horror are here, the record of terrible events - in this case several narrative layers of records - which itself seems infected by the evil it tells. The layers of the story are engrossing and once it draws you in, the typographical oddities and strangeness start to make you feel the same dread as the narrator: that this book has a mind of it's own.  why does the word 'house' always appear in blue? Are the occasional typos mistakes or intentional? It is always a little off kilter and slightly unsettling.<br />Is it just a horror story or is there more to it?<br />My take is that it is exploring what it would be like to be a fictional character in a book who is aware of their world, is aware of things changing as the author develops and revises scenes and settings, and remembers how they were before the revisions and is conscious of arbitrary changes in their world. Perhaps the invisible horror is the writer from the point of view of the characters; a thing that has total control over them, can make them appear and disappear but is outside their universe.  Isn't a book a House of Leaves?<br />It deserves to be better known, but then it would lose it's cult status and become too mainstream.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Being a fan of Sting anyway, I didn't really expect to be disappointed. The orchestral arrangements of his tunes took them to another level. He also talked about how a few of the tunes were conceived, which was pretty interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The thing I hate about this book series is that it has to end. Every now and then a series comes out that just captures you, and Hunger Games was one of those for me.  Loved it!  The movie was good, although they had to leave out a lot of details that make the story come alive. I kept filling my husband in as we watched, which i'm sure was annoying to him!  Now I sit here paging through the kindle offerings and wishing for another series that is going to keep me spellbound and dying to get back to my book like this series did.<br /><br />Thanks Suzanne.
B000C20VPA|5.0|Long story short, Casino was one of the first dvds I bought when I got my first player in the summer of '99. Standard flipper disc and the only special feature was the trailer. Watched it, wasn't blown away by it (having just seen the amazing Goodfellas), ending up selling it a year or two later.<br /><br />Fast forward to about a year ago I happened to come across it in the loaded Anniversary Edition at a flea market for $5. I figured I may had been a little to harsh with it the first time through plus the History Channel documentaries sounded interesting so I bought it and let me tell you how over a decade later my views have changed. This is an amazing movie.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Casino tells the operatic story of the rise and fall of Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) who, together with his best friend/ worst enemy Nicky (Joe Pesci) and his troubled wife Ginger (Sharon Stone in her Oscar nominated role) ran one of the largest casinos in Las Vegas and how they massacred it along with many people connected to them.<br /><br />I don't know why but I'm suddenly very fond of Casino. Perhaps its because it doesn't have the ghost of Goodfellas hovering over it like it did back in '99. Whatever it is, its a classic. The performances are all top notch despite the fact, as one reviewer pointed out, Pesci still seems to be channeling his more Alpha role of Tommy from the prior film. The movie is very graphic in terms of violence and language but then that's all a Mob movie staple particularly the death of one of the key characters in an open cornfield. Batter UP!<br /><br />The special features are numerous and are all good for multiple viewings, especially the aforementioned documentaries.<br /><br />Its unfortunate that Martin Scoreses appears to have lost his golden touch after this movie. Bringing Out the Dead was interesting the first time through but not again. The Gangs of New York was too stage pretty, The Aviator was just boring and, while The Departed was a pretty good throwback to his Mob Movie heyday, it still couldn't quite cut it with all of it convoluted subplots that went no where. Maybe he's trying to make his new muse DiCaprio the next De Niro but its just not working because DiCaprio is just not a great actor.  Whatever the case, at least we have Goodfellas and Casino to remind us of his legacy. Its just to bad that they may have been his last.ty good throwback to his Mob Movie heyday, it still couldn't quite cut it with all of it convoluted subplots that went no where.

B007ZRZF8I|4.0|fun game but this isn't a story driven rpg its fun to pick up and play just don't try to play with it for hours.
0446581356|1.0|The book is a total FAIL in my opinion. It didn't add anything to my makeup knowledge ( I consider myself familiar with most of the basic stuff about applying makeup) but I don't think this book will help beginners as well!<br />It's too general and boring. totally not worth the money.<br />If you're looking for a book which will add a huge amount of information to all levels (beginners & experts), I advise you to check out Rae Morries Book (2008).<br /><br />I was expecting a way better book than this from BB!! :(
0307454568|5.0|I loved the first 2 books of the triology.  They are very long but certainly kept your interest all the way.  For me, the best character was Salander.  She sure knew stragety and was indeed very smart.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|I'm glad I bought this box.  Now I have Barbirolli's famous 6th and pretty-good 9th, Rattle's excellent 7th, and Klemperer's famous 2nd (I wish the sound were better on that one).  I think Horenstein's 4th is lovely.  Tennstedt's live 5th is unsurpassed to my ear.  It's interesting to compare Tennstedt's 8th with others', given the lack of a double-chorus and what I now understand to be a separately-recorded organ track.  I would not have any of the vocal or other non-symphony works if not for this set, and I'm glad to now have no excuse not to listen to all of that.  One of these recordings I just can't listen to (Giulini's 1st with the weird miking and echoey room acoustics), but given the value of this set, that's just quibbling.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I downloaded the Hunger Games Trilogy to my Kindle to read on vacation.  While I wouldn't call it light vacation reading, once I started, I couldn't put it down.  I know it is considered young adult fiction, but I found it well-written and intriguing and I'm past 60.  I got involved with all the characters, found the situations they were thrust into dark and daunting, and enjoyed the paralells both to the current rage of reality shows and to the Roman forum games.  Also, I liked the fact that the book highlighted the capability of young people, rather than painting them as helpless pawns.  Every generation has had its youth literature that capitalized on the capability of the young; this is much darker than that literature of my youth - a parent away from home for a week was the sort of situation that let the literature kids of my generation show their competence.  I did not expect the final book to end as it did; I was more than thrilled with the ending.  Hope kept shining through darkness throughout all 3 books; the kids' devotion to their families; Katniss' alliance with Rue; the desire to end the killing; unexpected insights into character.  Three really good books, worth anyone's time.
B004EPZ03E|4.0|This movie was pretty cute for the whole family to enjoy.  Course we all love the chipmunk movies so it would have to be pretty bad for us not to like it.

1592537251|3.0|Great idea. Too bad the font is a thin sans serif that is troubling to read.<br />This is even worse when text is printed on gray background.<br />I agree that the wide range of sketchers and geography makes for a fascinating book.<br /><br />Danny Gregory hand writes his text and it isn't as frustrating to see.<br />Keep the author, fire the layout dude.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I read this book in one day while on holidays.  I enjoyed it as much as every other Sparks novel I've read.  It takes you to another world and really absorbs you.  A beautiful book.
1590171993|5.0|This is a highly accomplished work of literary art. Yet it is not artistic but is written in the straight forward, well constructed manner of some of America's best novelists. A novel is constructed and the better the pieces come together, the more coherent the vision or impression for the reader. Henry James and Vladimir Nabokov were masters of this approach to the novel where there are no extra useless details, no dead-ends and hanging characters, no essential questions left unanswered. John Williams writes in this tradition of Sinclair Lewis and the novel Stoner is as well constructed a novel as exists in the American 20th century canon.<br /><br />John Williams presents a very deterministic view of mankind in this novel. The characters are shown to be steadfast in their life track. Nature is not romanticized but eventually beats down those who daily toil, such as Stoner's mother and father. Society and social expectations also create a deterministic view of the world where people may select to be unhappy rather than rebel against social expectations. Social expectations defeat Stoner and his lover Katherine. Growing up in an unhappy family eventually results in an unhappy adult in the person of Stoner and Edith's daughter Grace. An old grudge lasts for 30 years and wears down William Stoner despite his resiliency. Thus John Williams has written one of the most deterministic novels where characters may rebel against their fate temporarily but eventually the determinism of time, age, prejudice, envy, society, relationships, organizations and nature win out.<br /><br />But John Williams is a balanced novelist and the forces of determinism do have a counter weight, which is the force of Eros.  It is this spark of love for language and meaning and human understanding that engages William Stoner and motivates him throughout his life. The forces of Eros however lead him to unwise choices in a mate when he is a young man but these same forces open him up to vast rewarding intimacy when he is 42 years old.<br /><br />Iris Murdoch says that a good novel must show justice to every character for the reader notes injustice on the part of the writer toward certain persons in a novel. This leads to the question of whether Williams demonstrates justice in the descriptions of Edith Boswick Stoner, William's wife, and Hollis Lomax, William's rival and chairman of the English department. Actually, he treats these characters very differently. Edith, a delicate and beautiful protected naive sexually frightened young woman, lacks meaningful experience, purpose and direction, a sharp intelligence and compassionate insight. Thus John Williams may be revealing Edith with the cold eye of reality. But Williams does allow her to gradually grow but never enough to gain our sympathy. Hollis Lomax is not explored in the same degree of depth as Edith but he is a wonderful portrait of wounded pride and arrogance motivated by misplaced self-righteousness and envy.<br /><br />Williams tells a good story. He does not digress. The plot moves forward with precision as he gradually unveils the internal character of each person in the novel. It is highly recommended.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love this game. if u like the smurfs game u will love this one to for sure. love it

B004Q7CIFI|1.0|Wow...for $19.00, does Stephen King come read the book to you personally. Way too much money to charge!!!! It's cheaper on iBooks.
B0009MAP90|4.0|Well it should go without saying that, since most of this stuff is nothing but cover songs, you can't really expect lyrical brilliance.  It is what it is, and it's decent.  Oh and before I forget to mention it- WOW, happy 50th birthday to this album!  That's amazing!<br /><br />\\"House of the Rising Sun\\" can't compare with the emotional intensity of the superior Eric Burdon & the Animals version but the downbeat acoustic style and Dylan's unusually southern voice makes it different enough.  He *does* give it a nice spin near the end when he raises his voice and really gets into it.  That makes it stand out a bit compared to the more familiar Animals version.  It's just very strange going into this album after hearing 15 or so OTHER Dylan albums and discovering that his voice is radically different on a song like this.  Not worse, just different.<br /><br />\\"You're No Good\\" has a hurried pace and memorable vocals.  Nice guitar strumming.  I like how he laughs during the \\"I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in\\" line.  \\"Talkin' New York\\" has wonderful lyrics about the chilly cold temperatures of New York and the vocal style seems like it influenced his \\"I Shall Be Free No. 10\\" song that he'd release a couple years later on his Another Side of Bob Dylan album.  I love the line \\"The New York Times said it was the coldest winter in 17 years... I didn't feel so cold then\\" and even better \\"A lot of people don't got much food on their table, but they got a lot of forks and knives so they gotta cut something\\", lol.<br /><br />\\"In My Time of Dyin\\" has a really surreal, almost deserted sound like you're standing in the middle of nowhere- like an old Johnny Cash album.  I love it.  \\"Well well well so I can die easy, Jesus gonna make up my dyin' bed\\".  \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" is a pretty country song with well-implemented and dare I say, somber harmonica work.  The way the harmonica is played is definitely unique.  \\"Fixin' to Die\\" is fast-paced acoustic blues but nothing particularly impressive.  \\"Pretty Peggy-O\\" takes us back to the familiar vocal style of \\"Talkin' New York\\".  Fast-paced harmonica based blues.  \\"Highway 51\\" is based around, you guessed it, steady-paced blues vocals, guitar strumming, and a style that we certainly do not associate with Mr. Dylan.  Still, it's extremely hard to dislike this stuff.  It's too easy on the ears, too melodic and simplistic to really have a problem with it.<br /><br />\\"Gospel Plow\\" is basically a continuation of the first side- acoustic, fast-moving guitar blues.  You either like this style or you don't.  Personally I like it but an entire album of this stuff with little in the way of interesting lyrics, musical arrangements and progression of any kind sort of hurts it.  Then again it's probably just a matter of having trouble appreciating the album knowing what Bob Dylan went on to accomplish (and what he was secretly capable of while recording this album- come on he didn't just magically wake up one day and become a lyrical genius).  \\"Baby Let Me Follow You Down\\" stands out from the pack for featuring a memorable vocal melody.  An underrated song this one is, in both the vocals and harmonica work.  Actually the guitar work is amazing too especially for the way it compliments the harmonica.<br /><br />\\"Freight Train Blues\\" is notable for the way Dylan carries his voice around the 1:15 mark and keeps it going for about 15 straight seconds.  That's pretty odd, haha.  \\"Song To Woody\\" is a country ballad.  Sort of boring and generic too.  \\"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\\" is another quiet song that's barely adequate enough to make an impression.  Dylan's vocals are at least more noticeable and just overall better on this track, but this (along with \\"Song To Woody\\") are the two low points by far.<br /><br />Overall, Dylan's debut 50th birthday celebration can officially get underway knowing that it is in fact, pretty good.  Blow out the candles or rather, keep them lit.

B000JMKRKC|5.0|the Thirteenth Tale combines the intrigue of the gothic genre with the ease of a modern novel to create a book that I could not put down. Setterfield's description of books, alone keot me riveted.

B000002KD9|3.0|Hey I like Neil Young and I especially like his electric guitar jams with Crazy Horse.  I also admire his late 80's/early 90's work.  I like plenty of Neil's other folk/country songs and albums as well.<br /><br />However After the Gold Rush fails to impress me any longer because to be completely honest, it's an example of getting into the songwriting *too* easily and quickly becoming exhausted with the material.  Not *all* the songs fit this description but at least half of them do.  You see a lot of times when you get into music too soon, it doesn't hold up over the years.  It doesn't contain replay value so you don't feel like hearing it anymore.  That's the case with After the Gold Rush.  The melodies are WAY too simple and, more often than not, borderline childrens songs.  Not that I could write melodies any better of course, but still.  These melodies are too simple.  I first heard After the Gold Rush 10 years ago and playing it again this afternoon my feelings haven't changed at all.  I *didn't* want it to be exactly how I remembered it.<br /><br />With that said, the title song is still able to impress me.  The chilling piano and Neil's vocals are magnificent on this track.  I never get tired of this one.  \\"Southern Man\\" is still awesome because, well for one thing I courageously grew beyond my stupid \\"classic rock radio\\" addiction so I can appreciate this overplayed song whenever I choose instead of having radio stations choose it for me.  I actually went through a period when I believed radio stations were not only my main source for music but were supposed to dictate what I should and should not listen to (what a silly and embarrassing phase THAT was... and it lasted 4-5 years.  I hate myself).  The guitar jam at the end is especially cool.  Any time that electric guitar is jamming on a Neil album, count me REALLY happy.  Live at the Fillmore isn't my favorite album of his for nothing (along with Rust Never Sleeps).<br /><br />\\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" is another standout.  I just love the way Neil sings along with the piano playing.  When the tempo changes during the final minute and Neil's tender emotions seem to build even stronger... just awesome.  \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\" is another classic.  Memorable chugging vocals leading into the sudden optimistic-like chorus \\"Don't let it bring you down, it's only castles burning\\".  \\"When You Dance You Can Really Love\\" is overlong by a couple minutes but I enjoy the vocal melody nonetheless.<br /><br />The songs I feel are boring to me now are \\"Tell Me Why\\" (even though I fancy the line \\"I'll be around for a while\\" which seems to indicate that Neil was aware of his destiny) and especially \\"I Believe In You\\" which is drenched is too much sap and high-pitched vocals that sacrifice what could have been a pretty melody without those things.  I honestly can't even listen to this tune anymore.  \\"Till the Morning Comes\\" and \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\" are basically nursery rhymes in their simplicity.  Meanwhile \\"Birds\\" and \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" are pretty decent selections with dreary vibes but nothing extraordinary.<br /><br />Not a highlight of Neil's discography.  I'm totally exhausted with at least half of the material presented and probably won't ever listen to the album again but I can see how the immediately accessible melodies and lyrics mean a great deal to many listeners.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I am pleased with this app overall.  However, I have now had the &quot;endless&quot; game start over twice: once around the 50th layer and most recently around the 95th layer.

B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I opened what I thought was going to be an original dvd only to find that the dvd was not an original.  The title on the disc was handwritten by someone.  This was clearly a copy of the original.  I have a dvd recorder, so I know a copy when I see it.  If I had not wanted an original, I would have recorded it from pay-for-view for $4.99.  Amazon sent me a replacement, but when I opened it up it was the same un-original dvd with someone else's handwritting on it.  I sent one of them back.  Now I am afraid to order more dvds.  Why pay $22 for something I can make myself for $5?
0143038583|4.0|Excellent book by mr Pollan: part adventure, part investigation, he explores the intricate web that connects producers and eaters, and does this by exploring three different \\"relationships\\": industrial (producers highly removed from the consumers, and both exploited by the powerful companies that control the processing-marketing-lobbying), organic (holistic interaction of all the actors - grass, animals, farmer, consumer - for a sustainable production of quality food), primitive (hunter-gatherer, where the producer is the consumer).<br /><br />The story line, repeated in the three different sections, sees mr Pollan placing himself at both ends of the process: contacting and \\"working\\" with the producer (driving the tractor on the corn fields, killing the organic chickens, hunting wild pigs and mushrooms) and then preparing a meal with the results of his \\"work\\" (eating McDonalds food, ...). He explores the deep - and often hidden - connections that make these systems work: biological ones, as well as political, economical, historical, evolutionary, cultural, ...<br /><br />I found the first part to be the most interesting, and almost every page had a \\"aha moment\\", where the mundane routines of our lives gain a deeper perspective and start making (more) sense in the broader perspective of the transformation process that turns the sun's energy into food.<br /><br />I give it four starts instead of five because I found his treatment of the ethical implications of killing animals a bit weak (but he did contact Peter Singer, so at least he's done his homework). I simply think his reasoning is flawed when he attributes moral significance to the \\"species\\" as distinct from the sum of the individuals that compose it. He just seemed a bit too eager to go on and kill that wild pig, but he still managed to sound sincere in his concern for the animals whose premature death made his meals possible.<br /><br />All in all a beautifully written and highly informative book that more people should read.

B0009MAP9A|4.0|Ever since I began to warm up to Another Side of Bob Dylan, I've been able to appreciate the Times They Are a-Changin' as well.  Hopefully that trend will continue with the Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.<br /><br />\\"Restless Farewell\\" is a quiet acoustic folk rock tune with honest lyrics about... well actually it's hard to decipher the meaning behind it but the focus seems to be Dylan giving a grand farewell with topics concerning money, women and war.  Pretty good melody at any rate.  Actually I detect a tone of sadness occasionally.  \\"Ballad of Hollis Brown\\" contains folk-style guitar playing that's catchy and snappy with a bluesy vocal melody.  It's a memorable song but lyrically there's not a whole lot of substance taking place.  \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" is hauntingly AWESOME in both the lyrics and Dylan's vocal mannerisms.  The atmosphere has a worried and frantic feeling thanks to the lyrical subject of a graphic crime scene and fighting for justice.<br /><br />\\"With God On Our Side\\" has a really good vocal melody despite its repetitive nature.  The lyrics are actually sort of cliched and uninspiring by Dylan's standards though, especially the part about Germany, World War II and Russia.  He's normally more creative with his words than what's presented on this track.  It's still a fantastic song though.  \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\" has lullaby tendencies given the softly enchanted vocals.  A pretty song but not a highlight.  \\"North Country Blues\\" has memorable lyrics about Dylan's brother and the subject of working hard around the clock with little in the way of getting any breaks.  The vocals remind me of Captain Beefheart's \\"China Pig\\".<br /><br />\\"Only a Pawn In Their Game\\" honestly has a boring verse melody but the lyrics make up for it.  It's about racism and government corruption.  The verse melody may stink but the lyrics are a pleasure to experience.  The title song... well what more can really be said about it?  You've ALL heard it, perhaps evenhundreds if not thousands of times.  The old-fashioned and almost chilling way Dylan delivers each line is what I will always remember the song for.  Even several years from now.  That atmosphere is just extraordinary.  \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" is one of the more underrated songs here.  The fast-moving, humorous pace with lyrics about ships coming in, waves, shorelines, and sands is basically like taking an audio ride to the beach!  \\"One Too Many Times\\" is pleasant enough, but actually unmemorable.  It's too quiet overall- that's the problem with the track.<br /><br />The Times They Are a-Changin' is fantastic however I do believe Another Side of Bob Dylan is better.

1439102813|5.0|Alice is a Harvard professor when she is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease.<br /><br />I thought this book was well written, though I had to concentrate through some of the technical descriptions (and probably didn't quite understand some of them.)<br /><br />Some things I wonder about:  (May  contain Spoilers)<br /><br />I wish the author had delved into where Alice's pills went.  Clearly the husband found the directive from cognizant Alice to demented Alice, and removed the pills from the bedside drawer.  When?  Why wasn't this included in the book?  Also, the husband alludes to this to the children, telling them they don't know what Alice \\"really\\" wanted, why wouldn't he tell them, they are adults. Perhaps he felt that they might help her commit suicide?<br /><br />I wish, at some point, Alice might have seen the other side of the coin when it came to Lydia, and her insistence that her daughter go to college, in case she has a need for a degree or connections in her \\"future\\". Considering this girl had a 50/50 chance of having the gene that caused Alzheimer's, and considering that Alice's life was drastically shortened because of the disease, why would she as a parent, not advise her child to do what makes her happy?<br /><br />This was a eye-opening look into the life of someone suffering from Alzheimer's, which I really had not given serious thought to.  However, as a story, I think the characters could have developed a bit more.  Where was the son, the \\"doctor\\", through the book? He lived in town and seldom appeared in the book.

B0080CL0HM|4.0|It is tragic that this movie was so far underpublicized by the production team and, consequently, did not find it's audience.  The performances are all superb.  The film is visually stunning.  The story is intriguing and moves you quickly from love to hate and back again for all of the characters.  A diamond in the rough sadly not getting to the masses.<br /><br />Robert Pattinson's turn as Georges DuRoy will have you loving and hating the man in equal measure, often careening from one to the other in the space of seconds.  While, sadly, the book-to-film translation of all of DuRoy's nuances isn't quite fully realized due mostly to some rushing of material, Pattinson's portrayal of the sympathetic blackheart leaves you not knowing if you want to kiss him or shoot him.  He moves effortlessly from moments of astonishing vulnerability to shere cold-hearted bastard status and right back again. He brings a sympathy for George's plight which I honestly felt was impossible after reading the novel.<br /><br />Colm Meaney is the standout of the supporting cast, playing the calculating Rousset to perfection, making you hate the man even as he suffers his final defeat.  The standout among Georges' leading ladies is absolutley Christina Ricci as the long-suffering Clothilde.  She is simultaneously wide-eyed innocent and worldly temptress and gives reason to Georges' softer moments.  Uma Thurman plays Mme Forrestier with a wit that is unexpected and has the pleasure of being the source of one of the most uncomfortably ironic moments of the film.<br /><br />The film itself is a visual feast, with wonderful costumes and sets, each themselves giving you a second lense through which to view DuRoy's accension.  The adaptation of the original novel could go deeper into examining the media influence on political climates.  But, in choosing to focus more on DuRoy's tumultuous circumstances, it is the cast that carries the movie, especially Robert Pattinson.  His portrayal of DuRoy is what makes this story direction work.  A weaker actor could not have done that.

B004EWFV9K|3.0|Kurt Wallander,immortalized by an extraordinary performance by Kenneth Branagh in the PBS TV series, has always been a brooding,and possibly depressed police officer tugging at the heart stings while solving mysteries.<br /><br />This final book is a slow moving mystery with few surprises and the plot involves cold war era events that might appear mundane,jaded and perhaps pointless. During this laborious process of unraveling the mystery of the disappearance of an older military couple, there are several chapters devoted to Wallander's struggle with his own mortality and his personal life  which distracts from the main plot-but that's always been the charm of Wallander stories.<br /><br />As a thriller,the book is slow paced. As a Wallander tribute, it does hit the mark and will satisfy Wallander fans though they might feel disappointed with the implication that this might be the last one in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic book! Was very pleased with the ease of the purchase and download! Will definitely purchase more merchandise in the future!! Thanks!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I guess when Martin Scorsese is putting together a documentary, no one is shy about granting an interview. It was great to see the likes of wife Olivia, son Dhani, Mac, Clapton, Jackie Stewart, Eric Idle, Ray Cooper, that Krishna Consciousness devotee, Ravi, Ringo et al reminiscing. Olivia gives a pretty frank account of their relationship, which must have been pretty stormy for her to have cited an adage I hadn`t heard before: `What is the secret of a long marriage...Not getting divorced`. She wouldn`t say so explicitly, but it would seem that George had a major problem with sexual fidelity even during this, his second and more fulfilling marriage. And how good could it make her feel, at the very end of the film, when George says the only thing he will REALLY regret about leaving this life is not being a father longer to his son. No mention of the wife.<br /><br />I, doubtless, am not the only one who has a real problem with George`s denigration of the only life we know for the sake of glorifying existence on some astral plane that probably doesn`t even exist. Still it seems he was a wonderful friend to a great many people and went out of his way to make them feel good. It could be a matter of both one-upsmanship and sour grapes: In his own mind he kept one-up on his rock`n`roll friends by holding to Krishna Consciousness by way of a supposedly profound and exotic (to Westerners) system of belief, one that would trump the superficiality of the celebrity circuit, and at the same time, he could wield his celebrity status to maintain a safe distance from real immersion in Krishna Con and many of its more boring adherents by keeping one foot in the world of music and film. Too bad he didn`t truly immerse himself for enough time to quit smoking, since that`s mainly what took away a decade or two from his lifespan. There`s where the sour grapes come in. It`s easier to accept that you`re dying prematurely (due to mostly your own misguided actions) if you believe that you`re not going to be missing much anyways since life is just maya and a pale shadow of a life beyond. I think if George had grown up in India, he might have eventually wanted to try on Roman Catholicism for size, but be equally ambivalent about that as well.<br /><br />Would have liked to see more about his career as an executive film producer, presiding over a very impressive set of films. More on his 1991 tour of Japan. Would have been nice to get a Dylan interview but I guess there`s the Dylan ego problem. More on his development as an Indian-music-influenced slide guitar player. Something on how he helped wreck Ringo`s first marriage by having an affair with Mo (Of course, they both wound up with far happier second marriages, so...) Such suggestions are not to criticize Scorsese`s choices, but merely to suggest just how interesting and rich George`s post-Beatles life was. We appreciators of George as an equal of John or Paul as a songwriter and player as of 1969 would love to have seen more, but I guess a four-hour documentary might have been too much for most viewers.<br /><br />Hilarious George ad Mac anecdote by Mac in the bonus features, though it does sound familiar. The bonus features are worth a peek, but all were definitely best left out.<br /><br />Anyways, a deserving tribute to the man from a director of note with a genuine interest in Harrison`s life. Well-done. Bravo. Much better than I had anticipated.

B00000JLWW|5.0|Went boss-eyed seeing the 3D version in my local cinema and got a cracking migraine as a result (I just can't cope with 3D movies: does anyone else have this problem?). However, although I ended the evening having to lie down with a cold flannel on my head it was worth it and yah boo sucks to all the snobs who hate this movie. Great performances from the two leads, clever quotes from film history (Lubitsch, Kubrick, Eisenstein: it's all there) even the much derided script contains some good lines (viz Rose's campy lines about Freud and Picasso).<br /><br />What a pity Millvina Dean (last survivor: died 2009, aged 97) didn't make it to 100 to join the guests on the memorial cruises to the Newfoundland Banks last month. She could have worn a copy of the Heart of the Ocean. Sorry, I know that is disrepectful to the all the poor souls who died so horribly (this film is a great testament to their memory) but I am rather addicted to campy moments.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie (can there be anyone?) see it. If you have seen it, see it again. Haters, open your eyes.

B00006F7S4|5.0|I must confess to never being much of a Beck fan.  I am a child of the sixties - in fact - I even had a record contract way back then - with exclusive Elektra - no less - as it was in thise days.  Thus, I'm partial to 'classic' vs. 'modern' (strange, almost oxymoronic rubric in post-modernity)rock, by nature as well as by inclination.  Odelay did nothing for me and still does nothing - quite conscious of the legions of Beck devotees and the tonnage of critical approbation out there.  Probably, I don't understand it. To this day, nothing particularly gets me going when Beck goes uptempo - the disco disfc Midnite Vultures is better, but vapid.  To my ear, Beck is the opposite of the multi-dimensional musician as acclaimed (think Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, folks), he is rather a master balladeer, intellectually astute, refined, who revels in the minor keys.<br />Thus, with this review I don't expect any positive votes when I say, that, in my often despised opinion, Beck has actually, finally made a great musical statement, a masterwork for the ages.  Indeed, Sea-Change speaks to and for our time more than much of anything else I've heard in rock over the past decade, and Beck's plaintive, marvellously dishevelled vocals emerge here as an orison for the opening of the new millenia (probably our last).  Sea-Change will endure because it is a complete, coherent and unified statement of much that is wrong and cannot be rectified with a mere flick of a switch.  He's caught the assumed pretensions of our civilization in the lurch.<br />Of course, one need not comment of the care to which Beck attends the performance of his always complex compositions.  But, here, it really comes off - he comes to a far deeper realization of his art - he's got all the celebrated subtleties of his touch working full tilt - and what is more, he's palying with purpose, which is a bit more than vision, alone.

1400069289|4.0|Overall, this was an excellent, informative book. I appreciated the very simple model that Duhigg presented about cue-routine-reward, and how we get caught up in unhealthy habit loops. I agree with others who have written that the chapter about \\"keystone habits\\" is particularly useful. As a coach, I plan to use the habit loop with my clients to explore areas where they feel stuck.<br /><br />Three things bothered me about the book (but not enough to refrain from recommending it):<br /><br />1) most, if not all, of the examples of someone changing a habit had crisis-as-catalyst. Duhigg acknowledges this (just as I'm reading and thinking \\"what about non-crisis situations?\\") in the first section of the book and states that habits can be changed without a crisis first. Then he continues to share examples that in some way involve crisis.<br /><br />2) I thought he collapsed \\"habit\\" and \\"addiction\\" way too often. I see them as connected (a habit may develop into an addiction, for instance), but different. To me, habit implies the individual has some sense of mental and physiological control, whereas addiction is less controllable, more destructive.<br /><br />3) The final chapter, about habits of societies, was a bit of a stretch for me. I didn't find the examples of the civil rights movement and Rick Warren's church to be compelling stories of habits at work. Those stories seem more appropriate for talking about social influence.

0345529057|4.0|I really like this series. The characters have completely drawn me in. The only thing was there were times when I had to stop and go back because I had no idea what was going on. There is just so much going on all the time. And there was a little too much detail for me (when you start talking about the thread in a clothing, unless its made from someone's eyeballs or something equally horrifying, I start skipping ahead). But the books are truly worth reading and afterwards the hbo series is excellent. The series is the ongoing story of debauchery and political intrigue. The women are as power hungry as the men. I liked that and so many other things about this fantastic series.

0439023521|5.0|Any 4th, 5th or 6th grade teacher with good readers will probably have one-half to two thirds of their class read the Hunger Games. Be sure to let them understand the author's message that this kind of violence mimics violence in everyday life throughout the world where young soldiers are sent off to war (perpetually) to be killed or kill for a \\"cause\\" whether it be noble or not.<br />  Humans when fully civilized will find a non-violent way or at least a more unique humane solution to end war and violence while protecting its people without sacrificing,typically, the lives of millions of innocent people.

0765365278|3.0|It is of my own personal opinion that this is not Brandon Sanderson's best work. I give it three stars because it is just that \\"it's OK\\". The world, environment, religion and characters are very interesting but I often found myself cringing at the story's cheesy lines and predictability. At times the book can be cumbersome and tedious to read, the pacing is painfully slow and the reader meets characters and never sees them again for hundreds and hundreds of pages. That caused me to feel very displaced and distanced from certain characters and I found myself thinking \\"Why should I even care about these people?\\"<br /><br />Also, the copy I received was an ex-library book and had a lot of typos. Beware of that.<br /><br />If you're new to his writing and want to read a good Brandon Sanderson book I suggest you try \\"Warbreaker\\" or the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\".
B004NTDEXY|4.0|For the price, there isn't really much room to complain about this 2-movie collection.  American History X has the better visual quality, but it's not extremely sharp.  The black and white sequences look the best to me.  Also, there's no extra features for American History X.  A History of Violence has loads of extras, but the video suffers from DNR which attempts to smooth out the picture at the cost of losing visual detail.  Both movies come on their own disc, so you aren't losing picture quality by squashing them onto a single blu-ray.  I like both movies quite a bit, so to get both on blu-ray for under $10 was certainly worth it for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and will recommend as a definite read. To me it was a sidestep from my usual fans and didnt regret buying the book. Let's go for the second book ...
B007JUWM64|1.0|I was looking forward to watching the new three musketeers, didn't have the chance to watch in theaters. So i deciced to rent it on amazon instant video. I am very glad i did not spend money at the theater to watch this movie. It was one of the worst acting movies I have ever seen. It was dreadful from the beginning to end. The whole time i kept thinking how I couldn't wait for it to end. The context was simply silly and the actors for the most were terrible. In my opinion I would of not even rated one star.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Part of what I like about the Kindle Fire is it's size.  Previously I had ordered [[ASIN:B005VTGCE8 AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 (Black)]].  It was just too bulky so I stopped using it.<br /><br />This cover however just feels right.  I was hesitant to buy one that had a material boarder to hold the Kindle in place thinking that it would distract from the viewing area  --  not so...<br /><br />The cover has a nice solid weight and feel too it without being overly bulky.<br /><br />When viewing in a portrait style I can slip my fingers into the pocket area and easily hold with one hand.  Being able to easily hold the product to read at night is important to me (more so than a horizontal view like for movies -- though that works nicely as well).<br /><br />This is just a quality product that adds style while protecting the product and it is still easy to use the procut as intended.
0887307280|5.0|This book is one that stands far above others in its class. It is the one entrepreneurial book, and I have several, that has stayed with me as I navigate this crazy journey of mine. It was the first book that really made me take a hard look at what it truly means to be an entrepreneur.<br /><br /> What I took from it was basically that being an entrepreneur is so much more than just owning your own business, it's being a visionary for that business. It's not trying to do every thing yourself, it's removing yourself from the mechanics of it all and allowing someone else to handle those things while you consider the big picture. I for one am the expert technician. No one can do the work better than I can, and that's exactly the attitude that causes most fledgling businesses to fail. Sure you can do everything perfectly by your lonesome, but you'll end up hating your business and hating your life and just forgetting what drove you to love what you do in the first place!<br /><br />So this book really hit home for me.  I had so many lightbulb moments.  Definitely give it a try if you're on the fence. I do not pretend to know everything about business, but for those who need a good talking to- this book is it!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A friend of mine had told me for months that I should read this book. Finally, I bought & downloaded it to my Kindle. What a pleasant surprise!! I enjoyed it immensely! You will read, I'm sure, that the story is about children killing children which is true. There is violence, but with little gore. I couldn't wait to see the movie, which I also enjoyed. I have since purchased, and read, the second book in the series and will soon read the third. The books are very well written and leave you wanting to read more.
B007WV05GY|3.0|Having read many of the reviews, I agree with the higher rated reviews that the acting and the dialogue born of the intense fear and the extreme situation faced by these men was actually very good.  Liam Neeson as usual was intense and is a pleasure to watch generally.  Unfortunately, as many reviewers have noted, there are some glaring inconsistencies and not quite believeable situations that kept me distracted from the story line. These seemly minor incongruities do make a difference.  The movie had promise and I felt could have been a lot better without them. First of all, I was amazed, as has been mentioned in a prior review, that after double belting himself across his seat, Neeson wakes up laying in the snow quite a distance from the wreckage? And apparently uninjured!  He hasn't a scrath on him, but when he finds his rifle, still in its case, it is apparently broken and unsuable?  It is mentioned in the movie that they hit the ground going 400 mph. Now this may have been a guess on the speaker's part, but for only several of them to survive suggests quite a crash, and then these survivors were walking without so much as a limp or broken limb (except one other who dies shortly after the crash due to bleeding)? Then there is the letter, which he apparently put in his pocket before the crash, and then finds it near the seat he occupied previously, after the crash? And where were the cell phones?  I assumed the movie was contemporary. Maybe that far out in Alaska there would be no signal.  But these men didn't really know how far they flew before the crash.  Not a single one pulls out a phone to see if there was signal? Did I miss something? And the wind chill factor. Would they really be able to walk several miles thru deep snow with no face mask or gloves in winds that would easily produce subzero temperatures?  Were they really safer walking out in the open from the wolves, with no serious weapons save a couple knives, rather than barricading themselves in thewreckage, where with plenty of water from snow they could survive a week easily?  And then after successfully killing a wolf using a stick with a bullet on the end, you see them in the woods, each carrying a torch, but not a single one carry one of those sticks? You can bet I would be carrying a stick fashioned into a spear or with a bullet on the end!  Obviously, to have a survival type plot, you can't have cell phones work, or have a rifle intact with ammunition ready to go, but there surely would be a way to make their situation more believeable so it doesn't distract from the point of the movie.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This has been a good addition to my Kindle Fire. I have been able to prop it up to watch movies on an airplane or just hold it to read my book. Not overly heavy but just enough protection to make me feel comfortable. I would recommend it!
B004EBT5CU|1.0|My biggest problem with the album is the fact that Adele's contralto jazz voice is being used in such a manner that I cannot distinguish each song from the other.<br />All Adele is, and I don't care what YOU think (Ohhhoho! I really don't!), is an over-produced wannabe-mainstream popper. She should be using her soully, jazzy voice to make good music, not stuff on the same record shelf as Lady Gaga.<br />Rolling in the Deep has to be the most annoying song I have heard in my LIFE. Rumour Has It is God-awful song that deserves to be shot, and those are the only two songs I can tell apart. The rest of the tracks have only slight differences that I, even though I can tell apart each Sharon Van Etten song (look her up! Amazing folk music!), cannot detect the subtle differences.<br />Adele is trying too hard on this album. Her voice is somewhere between an Amy Winehouse, except not as rough and not nearly as amazing, and a Lady Gaga, except every song is about her ex.<br />How can Adele cite Alanis Morisette as an influence on this album, cause this album sucks?<br />You want good music? Amy Winehouse, Norah Jones, A Fine Frenzy, Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple... heck! I would even choose The Dixie Chicks over Adele!<br />Leave North America, and don't come back until I see a solid jazz album, in the vein of Frank, Tidal, Come Away With Me, and 11:11!<br />JOY! REPLIES!<br />-------------<br />I did say I liked her voice right? Just that it isn't being used in the right way. If Diana Krall tried to sing along with a song by Nirvana, she would crash and burn, right? Just like since Adele is trying to sing something that sounds like it was written by a depressed Avril Lavinge, accept maybe a grade ahead (A grade ahead of Avril Lavinge is still an elementary grade, mind you), when she has this unique jazzy voice she could put to good use on a jazz record! I don't have anything constructive to say about the record itself, cause there is nothing constructive to say.<br />Now, asfar as how I got on here and said what I thought of this record (which I did not say, \\"sucked\\" by the way. Commenter made that part up...), why can't I? All the five star reviewers over-glorify Adele, like she's something new and unique (Example... Ohmigosh, I'm a 12 year old girl and Adeles music is like so inspring n i can apply it to this relationship i had with this boy... U suld rlly buy this cd!)... The whole \\"Amy Winehosue Sound-Alike\\" thing has been beat to death. If she does sounds just like like Amy (no, she doesn't really), then what makes her so unique?<br />People who are unique? People who do their own thing? People worth listening to?<br />Cat Power<br />Regina Spektor<br />Fiona Apple<br />Amy Winehouse<br />Tegan and Sara<br />Sia<br />Marina and the Diamonds<br />Whoohoo! Now, I know you're just going to add these artists to the \\"Artist's I Hate\\" List, just cause I recommended them, and actually have taste in music beyond pop and coughAdelecough.<br />Farewell children!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books in a very short time and could not put them down.  This book made me think of Christian as the ideal romantic for my romantic heart.  Aside from his problem I kept wishing I was the object of his passion--wishing there was such a man out there who would want me and love me the way he loves Anastasia.  Here is a very handsome, generous, extremely rich man who, once he finds someone to love, loses all interest in every other woman but Anastasia.  He wants her for himself only and wants to protect her.  He could have most women but no, he wants this one girl.  He is so unaware of his unbelievable beauty which of course is a draw for most women.  How many women would not want such a man? I think many women would love that sort of man.  Beauty is a big turnon.  He had everything--looks, money, loyalty and he really was a very nice person regardless of his hangups.<br /><br />He goes from being a dominant who hurts women with the whip, etc. without being intimate, to a man who is a fantastic lover and very erotic and very loving.  He is constantly kissing, nuzzling, holding hands and doing everything to please his woman.  He no longer wants to hurt--he wants to protect.  Once he marries her he does not want a prenup because he feels everything that is his is hers.  He is a little overboard in his jealousy and possessiveness but he is so endearing that I am sure a lot of women would love to have a man such as this.  Oh what I would give to have such a man!  I love it when he tells her she is his--\\"you are mine.\\"  For days I would simply close my eyes and daydream.  His experimentation with eroticism is quite exciting.<br /><br />A lot of the stuff is repetitive.  At one point I did not want to go through the love scenes in detail again. What bothered me is that they fought too much.  If people are always snapping at one another I would think it would eventually erode the passion.  I was glad she backed off a little.  Fighting for me personally is a turnoff.  I did not want to see this romance go to the dogs. I hoped and prayed that they would stay together.<br /><br />Another thing that was unreal was their having sex 2, 3 times a day.  I kept wondering how they could keep this up year after year--unless of course she is a nymphomaniac.  Eventually, this passion would wane--it is human.  How long could this last.  How many of us are as constantly willing as Anastasia?  I think part of the appeal to Christian was that she was always ready, quite orgasmic and willing to experiment.  That is great!  It is a good way to keep the hubby at home since a lot of men would love this sort of thing but don't get it since their wives get tired and bored and then they stray.<br /><br />All in all I think this author wrote her own fantasy down in words.  I want her to make them happy forever even though it is unrealistic.  So many relationships end badly, it is depressing.  When I read these 3 books they made me happy, I quite frankly would love to have her produce a whole series of them until they are both old.  (laugh)  I do not want it to end. I do not care how repetitive or boring.  She kept me reading, eager to see what happened next.  I love television a lot, but I did not turn it on because I found it difficult to put these books down. In real life it rarely happens.  What is wrong with daydreaming and feeling good about a love story--a never ending love story no matter how improbable?<br /><br />I would love to say \\"thank you\\" to the author for writing such a \\"feel good\\" story.  She took me into a world of wonder.  Thank you.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|When I saw the list of actors in this movie, I assumed wrongly that it would be more than just a few action scenes held together with a rather dull, uninteresting plot, and bland acting.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, why were several very good actors in this movie given the lack of substance with no real chance for good acting?  Carano is beautiful, good at what she does obviously, but she is not an actress; you would have thought she would be included to spice it up a bit but not the main show.  Once again I was left disappointed as I have been with so many new releases in recent years.  They throw some good actors into a movie with a weak plot simply to make a dollar.

068484267X|5.0|The childhood of Frank McCourt was a whirlwind of experiences that created the intelligent, quick-witted, and storied author of the memoir Angela's Ashes. Relentless class systems, decrepit, poverty stricken communities, gnawing hunger; all of these themes are superimposed over the early life of strapping young Frank McCourt; a talented young boy living \\"the miserable Irish Catholic childhood\\" in the slums of 1930's Limerick. Parks, grocery stores, train stations, coalmines, and the post office are the locale for the adventures of Frank's childhood. There are no heroes or villains, just people; people who struggle and grieve and rejoice together in a city wrought with poverty and misfortune.<br /><br />Angela's Ashes takes you though the memorable adventure that was Frank McCourt's childhood. McCourt begins the memoir with the meeting of his parents at a pub in Brooklyn.  Frank is borne a sister, and his life seems to be changing for the better. Her tragic death sends his mother into a depthless depression and amplifies his father's already ruinous alcoholism. After moving back to Limerick, Frank nearly dies from typhoid, but finds solace in storytelling and the written work of Shakespeare. Frank gets his first job at the local post office, through which he finds himself in his first sexual relationship with a woman. Her death gives McCourt the money he needs to pay for passage to America, where a bright new chapter of his life awaits.<br /><br />Parts of McCourt's life fit in with how his memoir relates to journalistic history. Frank lived through the Great Depression. His realistic account of what life was like in the slums of Ireland give new insight to the time period. McCourt brings the reader right in to the grittiness of his childhood. He showed the world that hope could exist in even the darkest of times, and that sometimes stories told through the eyes of a child can be more powerful, memorable and thought provoking than those of experienced writers.<br /><br />Frank narrates his story in a plethora of different manners. Symbolism is an important and effective mechanism used throughout the memoir to illustrate elements of Frank's life in a compelling and relatable manner. The River Shannon is an appreciable example. Ever-present in Limerick, the River Shannon represents the bleakness and desolation that Frank is stuck in. As Frank grows up, he changes, and so does the river. The River Shannon becomes a symbol of hope; hope of escaping Ireland and forging a new life across the Atlantic. A very different symbol is ashes. Ashes represent the dark, lifeless world that Frank grew up in. They represent the cloak of depression around his mother; the cloak woven from her crushed dreams and failed attempts at raising a healthy family. Ashes are the stark reminder of the reality Frank lives in, and the semblance of what life could have been.<br /><br />All in all, Frank McCourt weaves a timeless tale that readers can relate to. Symbolism, songs, sadness and story telling all come together in startlingly emotional tale of a young boy and the man he becomes; the adventures of life paving every step of the way.br />Frank narrates his story in a plethora of different manners.

0439023521|5.0|Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor..<br /><br />But let's keep it real there is nothing Happy about the hunger games.  I saw this movie before I read the book and I must say the movie does the book no justice, you can't feel the love coming from the movie like it radiates of the pages of this book.  I received the Hunger Games collector's edition in a prize package from BookBuzzr.  Even though the movie told me the basics I wanted desperately to read the book.  Let's face it the movies take out so much you never know what you miss.<br /><br />Let me tell you, I love a good love story.  Who doesn't?  Suzanne Collins brought her A Game with The Hunger Games. The Capitol of Panem holds these annual games every year, where one man and one woman is chosen from each district out of 12 districts to fight to the death and only one survivor can remain. Sounds like a horror story right?  That's what I thought.  I was prepared to read about combat fighting and lot of blood and gore but this book was totally the opposite.  Yes it had it's blood and gore moments but this is a true love story mix in with survival, suffering, hopelessness and everything in between.<br /><br />I was captivated by the author's words and she brought me into her world.  I was Katniss Everdeen in the capitol of Panem and it was going down, my sister had just been chosen to participate in the 74th annual Hunger Games and she is just twelve years old.  MY GOD! The type of cruelty this Capitol rains down on their people is the funkiest foulest thing that could ever be imagined in the history of mankind period.<br /><br />Katniss Goes threw it all, in the Cornucopia once the gong rangs out all of the tributes go for the weapons that are on clear display and of course there is a battle to get to them.  Katniss has to fight, kill, eat raw food, pine food, but must be careful because there are poison berrys, traps the Gamemakers have set, the woods are her shelter and only one of themcan survive.  I almost read this book over again it was so good.  Suzanne Collins will have you hopeful, screaming, crying, in love, and rooting for Katniss survival.<br /><br />And she leaves you with the greatest cliffhanger of all because your left wondering what will happen next.  I recommend this book for everyone there's no way you would not love it!<br /><br />Stephanie N Norris<br />Author Of Trouble In Paradise

0385334176|4.0|\\"Deadeye Dick\\" starts out with a vintage Vonnegut gem, as the opening paragraph of chapter one is a lovely and unique statement about how we set our values in life. Actually it is about how our values are placed on us by the environment in which we are raised and nurtured. He sets up the motif of our lives as peepholes which open when we are born, and close when we die, and that is it. It is a clever and original method of presenting this thought.<br />This novel reads and feels like a typical Vonnegut in its style and simplicity, and I will not complain about that. The novel is told in first person by the protagonist Rudy Waltz (who earns the unfortunate nickname Deadeye Dick early in his life) and once again Vonnegut employs simple childlike language to deceive you into zipping along with the reading and then suddenly finding yourself immersed in the middle of a profound thought. Then you are stuck thinking about it, and it is off to the races. The narrative is told as Rudy recounts for us his life, and for the most part it is told in linear flashback scenes. Vonnegut also incorporates an interesting device here, as Rudy likes to examine bits of his life as little \\"playlets\\". This device is effective for a couple of reasons as it breaks up the narrative style of the novel, and it also highlights the idea of our lives as short bursts of theater or stories. We are all \\"tales told by an idiot signifying nothing.\\"<br />Chapters twelve and thirteen of this text are mesmerizing in their simplicity and depth of theme, and in chapter twelve especially Vonnegut does something that is nothing short of amazing. He makes you feel immense and deserving pity for a person who accidently and arrogantly shot and killed a pregnant woman on Mother's Day. The reader finds themselves embarrassed when they recognize the fact that we seem to lose our humanity when we are confronted by the worst among us and fail to see that they too are human. Shame on us Vonnegut is saying, and it stings. Of special mention is an editorial that the husband of the murdered pregnant women writes in the local paper. It ends chapter thirteen, and although I don't agree with all of it, wow oh wow is Vonnegut on fire in this part of the book.<br />On page 127 of the novel Vonnegut put his theme right out there for all to see. Rudy has spent his life connecting with no one and nothing. He is a virgin, has no friends, no real career, etc. All of this out of fear of hurting other people. It is foolish nobility, as pain is a part of life and is to be accepted, maybe even embraced as a sign of being alive. Vonnegut seems to be saying that the tragedy in Rudy's, and our, life is not that he has done an awful deed that forever changed his and others lives. It is that he gave up and stopped living once it happened. Vonnegut is warning us... Not you too! You will hurt and be hurt, but live damn it!<br />At one point in the novel a character obsesses about a parachute while flying, wanting to guarantee a safe landing. \\"Deadeye Dick\\" seems to be saying keep looking, and don't stop flying in the meantime. Many reviews have said this is a dark novel. I disagree. I think it is urging us to live. At one point a character says, \\"This is as much Shangri-Lai as anywhere.\\" That is the point folks. Embrace your own place in this world, and make it work to some extent. Rudy Waltz is the example of what not to be. Vonnegut is not celebrating him; he is using him as a warning bell.<br />Heed the warning, and read this book.gs.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love the game and think it SHOULD be a 5 star game. the major down side is how randomly the wait times on everything gets glitches to where times turn to over 100s of hours of real wait time. ive had this happen to me twice now and it is very frustrating. making an update to fix this would make this game great.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|I expected better from P. D. James, I really did. I thought that at last someone who knew what they were doing was going to add to the Austen story in a positive way. Nope. There was no reason for this book to be written. The characters did not develop, there was nothing interesting or engaging about the story, and the best I can say is that it was at least literate, unlike some of the efforts of recent writers attempting the same thing. Forgettable--I hope.
B000065V3H|5.0|This is my favourite movie it is funny sweet and dramatic in the right areas. I really think this should be on blue-ray. I love it. Amanda should<br />of got an award for this!!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Love playing this as its more exciting than the other titles. The entire gravity idea to the game is what makes it so much better. However, I agree its quite short with only 2 level packs compared to how the others, which are only free-.99&cent;, have much more. Four stars until more content is added. Definitely recommend the game still everyone.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|great for the price.  A little more adventure than hidden object.  If you like Must type games or the like you will enjoy this. Best game I have found so far!
B002O320TA|5.0|Johnny English is a hilarious movie.  I had never seen any of these movies before and when I saw the previews of the newest one that came out I had to see others.  We laughed throughout the entire movie.
1410430103|3.0|Others have given the gist of the book. So I'll be brief:<br />I liked latter books of Lee Child much better. Here he is still feeling his way, imo, and fills up pages with fluff and descriptions, so I found myself skipping whole chunks of test. If Child listens to Elmore Leonard's dictum to cut out the parts the reader skips, he'd cut this book by 30-40%. But the remaining 60-70% is not bad. The character of Reacher begins to emerge, though much of it is by exposition. (A more sophisticated writer would have let background emerge only when the info is needed.) But for a beginning writer (which Child was at the time), this is pretty good. Three stars.
B00004R99L|5.0|Exactly what I wanted; great price!!!  Fast shipping :) My granddaughter loves this movie and we broke the first one.  Glad to get this one
B0036T31YY|5.0|First off I have never felt the need to write a review before this movie but I see so many people giving this a bad one I wanted to add my 2c.<br /><br />This may be one of the best \\"loop\\" movies i have ever watched. It has so much going on inside of that I found myself constantly wondering what would happen next and how it was going to happen. By no means am I a film critic or would ever claim to be one, but the acting in this movie seemed very spot on to me. Watching a woman struggle with so many emotions that she seemed to play so naturally was a real pleasure.<br /><br />I really dont want to say much because anything I do say will almost be a spoiler to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a new movie to try and and are into a sci-fi/fantasy element then I would definatly give this a look. Very well made and one that you will be thinking about for a long time after watching it.
B00F4FFO8E|3.0|To confirm, these are all exactly the same DVDs that were released in 2006. No new special features or transfers, this is just a repackaging of the same discs - literally! These discs are the exact same ones you would have found in the Christopher Reeve Superman collection from 2006, and the Superman Returns disc is just disc 1 of the two disc set.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Very easy to use. I followed the instructions and it did exactly what I wanted it to do.  On screen prompts were very clear and everything showed up on my computer.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|This is a great CD.  Jessie has absolutely amazing rich sexy hot fantastic vocals!  Her songs are interesting at worst and fascinating at best.  PRICE TAG IS SO COOL YOU COULD NEVER GET SICK OF THIS SONG!
B005PR2FD8|1.0|This movie is just bad, really bad. If you have no knowledge of the franchise prepare to be lost, in fact even with knowledge of the franchise  you will be lost.<br /><br />The story is unintelligible, making the Super Mario Bros. movie look amazing by comparison. The animation is bad, the humans look way to stiff at so many moments you'd think they were robots. It's a bad movie by bad filmmakers, avoid in all costs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|So addicting.  I loaded this app onto my Android tablet and I am hooked.  Even better since it is free!
B00756GKBA|4.0|I have loved Madonna from way back when I first saw her in some cool outfit, a little chubby but hotter than Hell doing Like A Virgin and I was totally blown away!!  This CD though is mostly filler.  It isn't really good and it isn't really bad.  Song Two Gang Bang is one of the best tracks but I have to feel that while sometimes it seems Lady GaGa rips Madonna off sometimes this song is classic Lady GaGa. It blatantly tries to be incredibly provocative and more or less succeeds.  Gotta love when she belts out  Drive Bitch and while you're at it DIE BITCH!!  MASTERPIECE SAVES THIS CD BIGTIME!!  This song is incredible, beautiful lyrics beautifully sung!  When I drive my teenage boy to school I play it over and over and over and over and over again!  It is one of my favorite songs of all time!  I think Madonna is bigger than life and yet sometimes she seems so small.  Does that make sense 2u at all or is it just too late and I'm sleepy?  I would recommend you buy this CD for the song Masterpiece alone and there is no other CD I have ever heard that I think would be worth the cost for just one song EVER!

0753801728|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />Well, I don't know where to start. This book is short but heavy. Not heavy in terms of weight but heavy in terms of emotions that it carries. With a postwar Germany as its background, what did you expect?<br /><br />The book starts on a lighter note with a 15 year old boy who happens to meet a woman. And then there's no looking back.<br /><br />The book takes you on a journey so unique in itself that you find yourself pondering on it. I got confused a couple of times during the reading and had to re-read what it was about. The book is mysterious, I think I can call it that.<br /><br />The secrets spill out one by one and everything changes. I don't want to spill the premise or what happens afterward, so I'm at a loss of what to write.<br /><br />In all, this book made me think a lot. I don't think there's one answer to anything in this book. It will make you agree and disagree with your own thoughts. It will make you want to change things. It will make you emotional and you will speculate to no end.<br /><br />This will make a wonderful book for a book club. I wish I had someone to discuss it out loud with, this is one of that kind.<br /><br />I think I loved this one but then again, I'm not sure. LOL! I will have to re-read it sometime soon. I think I will watch the movie too.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Ordered, Delivered promptly, properly packaged, works well. Small dissatisfaction with the fact that Chinese Subtitles appear part way through the movie distracting but not destroying enjoyment of movie.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|One of the biggest features that they advertise is the 3D Lyrics. However, after I purchased the &quot;encore&quot; or paid version that feature was greyed out. I missed the opportunity to get Shazam Encore for free last year, and that is what this is worth. Soundhound, I thought was pretty good but after I paid for this,i rate soundhound at 10 stars!! P.S. Don't bother trying to email tech support, they don't respond. I am assuming that they are just playing Angry Birds, waiting for a bigger software company to buy them out.
0345535421|5.0|The Night's Watch, with Jon Snow in tow, has set off north of the wall while Rob Stark, the newly proclaimed King of the North, begins his trek towards King's Landing with the ultimate goal of defeating the Lannisters. Meanwhile, the Baratheon brothers have both claimed their brother's throne as their own, splitting the kingdom further. Friends have become enemies as the families of the land must choose which side to support. And in the East, Daenerys Targaryen continues with her plan to reclaim the throne herself.<br /><br />There's probably no way around spoilers. If you've not read any of the series or at least watched the first season, I'd hate to ruin the surprises. I think it's going to be harder and harder to be vague with descriptions the further in I get.<br /><br />And if you happen to be watching the show and have read the books, you'll understand when I say I love them both! There are small changes in the show. Characters and campaigns are combined to streamline the story into one season. To be honest, most of it makes perfect sense to me. I think it's a great testament to the writers on the show that they're able to remain so true to the original. And even though I'm caught up and know what's coming next, I'm still dying to go on to the next episode every Sunday night.<br /><br />The scope of the story is pretty spectacular. The worldbuiling alone is amazing. The Seven Kingdoms have a long and intricate history, which we see more of in the book than we do in the tv show. And of course the characters make all the difference. Each one is layered and rich in a way that makes them real. Good guys have the potential to do very bad things. Bad guys somewhat have the potential to do good things. Some of the characters walk a fine line, making me wonder just what Martin has planned for them in the end.<br /><br />This is a massive series. Epic as any epic can be and set to be a total of seven books, five of which are out now.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app! it has so many photo editing options and the selection is so wide. its also fast and easy to use!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|It's a keeper!  The production values are killer and a great system really enhances it!  A great family film and show the horrors of war not just on people but horses as well.
B0064W65UM|4.0|What can I say about Alan Moore, that hasn't already been said...? He is a MAD GENIUS! The universe in his mind is an extraordinary place and we are lucky that he shares a small piece of that place with us. Happy Reading!
0345803485|1.0|After dragging through the entire silly thing which was annoyingly similar to twilight, I finally got to the ending....TERRIBLE!!! Why...WHY? So angry that the book has been so over-hyped, over-blown and so mad at myself for wasting time and braincells on this trash. The ending if this book is just insulting. Nice attempt to get me two suffer through two more books, but I'm not that stupid. Just like Ana wants more, I want more...like intelligence and good writing that makes sense. Reader beware!
0547258305|1.0|I can't believe this book was published, and I can't believe that people are giving it such good reviews! My main complaints were:<br /><br />- Terrible writing<br />- Predictable plot (come on, who didn't see Katsa falling in love with 'Po' from the first time they meet.)<br />- Po? Really? That's the name you came up with? God, I tried so hard to like these characters and I actually felt like the author was trying to make it difficult<br />- Katsa is a terrible heroine. I read the book because of the glowing reviews stating that the novel featured a 'strong' female character. She is sadistic, selfish, violent and flat at best. She is good at EVERYTHING. Her Grace is that she can own your ass at anything and everything. Seriously, and if by some sliver of a chance that you beat her at a game of climb to the top of the tree because she hasn't slept in 17 days, then by god, she'll rip your throat out. If you don't believe me, read the several dozen references about how she purposefully tries to destroy her horses because she likes to go fast. Its disgusting.<br /><br />Seriously, stay away from this book.
B0013ANMWY|1.0|The movie should have stuck to the original premise of an adult couple trying to stay one step ahead of the aliens. In this version it is mother and son, with the son being \\"somewhere\\" while mother desperately tries to rescue him. This mother/child-in-danger scenario has been done over and over to the point of boredom. The son is immune to the alien virus. He may have antibodies that will save the world and momma, who was spit upon and infected by an alien. Yawn.<br /><br />Instead of seeds pods, the deadly virus is passed via spittle and vomit. Lovely. There's no hiding and hoping to catch a few winks far away from an alien seed pod. The virus is already inside, placed there by a vomit-laced cup of coffee or a spit in the kisser. Double lovely. Sleep activates the virus, which turns the human into an emotionless alien. The only remedy is to stay awake... and run, run, run while being chased, chased, chased...must save son...must behave as though infected... avoid suspicion and capture...must stay awake... must find the son, save the world.<br /><br />After an hour of this nonsense, I didn't care anymore, especially when I realized there was another 38-minutes to go. The movie drags on and on, running, chasing, eye lids fluttering, popping pills to stay awake.<br /><br />The ending is as stimulating as the obnoxious run and chase scenes. I was going to rate it with two stars simply because it kept me watching to the end, but the finale wasn't even worth the time invested. I hated the movie. I hated wasting the time needed to watch this drivel, hoping it would get better. It didn't.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Why can't people understand that God is not real? What evidence is there to prove this imaginary friend gone wrong is real?
0345803485|1.0|Oh my god! This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I couldn't even finish it! After four chapters I just couldn't go on. The writing is SOOOO bad. The characters are flimsy and cliched, and I couldn't stand the narrator.<br /><br />As an aspiring author myself I can't decide whether the completely inexplicable, apparent popularity of this tripe leaves me with hope or despair. On the one hand it turns out that it doesn't matter if i can't write- apparently a ramped up publicity campaign will take care of that. On the other hand what if it turns out I write well, the thought of my work (and the work of so many other TALENTED writers) sitting on the sheleves next to this CRAP as though they are equal makes me wild.<br /><br />It makes me mad just to think of the trees that gave their life so that this THING could be printed and distributed. I'm also mad with myself for being duped into buying this book in the first place.<br /><br />The ONLY positive to come out of this is that I have the chance to warn others before the go wasting money on this utter shiite. Please people, heed this warning DO NOT give this the time of day.(less)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a decent game that can be interesting the only problem woth it is the low amount of people that play it

B003U6BE8I|1.0|I read the book and watched the movie...I loved it!<br /><br />THE BOOK!!!!!!!<br /><br />The movie is SO STUPID!!! The resemblances? It has a kid named Percy...maybe some more... Why can't they make sea of Monsters? Here's why:<br /><br />1. They don't show you Clairese<br />2. I don't think you can poisen a stupid gate...It is supossed to be a TREE!<br />3. I only watched it ONCE...and I'm pretty sure Percy destroys Luke...<br />4. Percy is in High-School...that defeats the whole \\"At the age of Sixteen\\" part of the Prophecy!<br /><br />Also, there is no fight with Ares...I think we are missing something here! Not to mention Percy brings a phone to Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Imporium...which is stupid because having a cell-phone(or at least using it)is moreless saying \\"Hey Monsters! Come And Get Me!\\" Oh, and another thing, they don't even show Kronos! WHAT THE HECK!<br /><br />Read The Book First! Then watch the movie and start complaining!
B00762ZPOQ|4.0|The DVD came to us in terrific shape and just as expected.  It played perfectly and we got it very quickly.  Very pleased.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is very helpful, it is especially useful when you sleep through your old radio alarm clock.<br />You can change the sound every day so you don't grow accustom to it (with 24 different ring tones and the option to open another app such as Pandora radio)  and end up sleeping past the time you set it for. So far it is the most helpful app that I have downloaded and used.
145162445X|5.0|After Steven Weinberg and Stephen Hawking books, Lawrence Krauss is the third great one I've read about cosmology, plenty of fascinating interpretations of new discoveries. Update yourself with understandeble reasoning, even if you are not native English speaker !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Modeled after the events of Stephanie Meyers Twilight this is the story of two people with a very different kind of relationship. This book is for adults only.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read this book straight through (twice actually...plus the follow-up book, Point of Retreat (twice, too), in one very sleep-deprived weekend) and I would give it 6 stars if I could. With a talent that, in my opinion, far surpasses many major authors, Ms. Hoover's writing is succinct, fluid and graceful. The humor is subtle - not over the top, but definitely present throughout.  The drama is high, and the resolution is so, so sweet.<br /><br />The author fabulously crafted a cast of amazing characters...AMAZING characters. Every last one of them.  I can't tell you how refreshing it is to read a young adult novel filled with intelligent, witty characters making good, well thought out decisions and acting responsibly. That is not to say they are boring...not in the least. The conflict in the book is caused by life - the kind of stuff that happens to you, to me, to the guy down the street - and not by the characters' hasty decisions or an endless stream of misunderstandings: things which seem to be the driving forces behind so many other books of this genre.  The situations, the characters, their passions, their interactions and their reactions are all real and raw and heart-wrenching. Beautifully, tearfully, heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Slammed has earned a permanent spot on my favorites list. Not only has Colleen Hoover introduced me to an art form I knew nothing about and a kick*ss band I'd never really paid attention to before, but she has taught me some valuable lessons about the really hard stuff in life.  Put simply, Layken was not the only one \\"schooled\\" on this journey.

0061726834|5.0|Disappointing sad ending, but SUPER book.  Oliver is a great writer who paints pictures with words and keeps the suspense flowing without gore and guts.  Nice love story and a very unique idea, which really makes you think about love and desire, and the problems it causes, but also the joy it brings.  Great read, and I am anxious to get started on her sequel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finished this book in one sitting. I cannot stop reading, every page gives excitement . Same thing with the first 2 books - The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. 'am glad I have kindle installed, because I cannot find these books in iBook . I keep on looking for a nice novel so far.

0307588343|2.0|I ordered a book from Amazon, my first order ever. I received the order 5 days after the expected date and the quality of the book is different from what I normally would see in a physical bookstore. Though the book was in excellent condition but I have issues with page quality, inconsistent ink etc. Also there is no tracking system for my order, as I am in Vietnam ( prob out of Amazon's control) so I was a little frustrated when I didn't receive the order for 5 days.<br /><br />Would I go for Amazon again, prob yes, 1 more time to see if anything is different......
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is such a good game for building a city or community ! it is really fun and easy to achieve the goals!  but I would say u should b able to earn acorns in an easier way!!!
B001JIHGO0|4.0|This movie was surprisingly entertaining!<br />What I liked about the movie:<br />1. The action was non-stop!<br />2. All the actors nailed their characters!<br />3. The visual effects were astonishing!<br />4. The Dracula beast rocked!<br />5. The werewolves looked very scary and imposing!<br />6. Van Helsing used lots of cool weapons and methods to handle evil doers!<br />7. The castles were great looking!<br />8. Dracula's three brides were beautiful!<br />9. The Frankenstein monster was cool!<br />10. The movie was well thought-out and put together!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. The movie was a little too much like a video game!<br />2. Sometimes the visual effect creatures looked cartoon-ish!<br /><br />Overall, I loved this movie more than The Mummy series! Watch if you are into action flicks!<br />My grade A- or four and a half stars!
B005NF2UE6|5.0|This is a great one!  Its much like their regular for radio music!  There are a few rocking songs that you listen to again and again some of the lyrics are questionable but the songs all work great and it is a good CD!
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|I wasn't sure but thought, why not give it a chance...  and I could not be more pleased.  The movie came on time as Amazon stated.  The packaging arrived in great condition and the DVD inside reflected this.  The movie itself was a surprisingly awesome movie.  It was well acted and the photography was strong.  The story made sense, better then most B horror movies.  If this was given a chance, it may even have a strong following.  Well worth a chance, and I doubt you will be disappointed.

0780624890|4.0|While moving from home to college and multiple apartments before buying a house, I lost this movie (but 2 and 3 remained in my collection).  It was about time to buy this movie again.  I looked at a few local stores but did not see this in stock so I went to Amazon.<br /><br />Package:  No dents, no dings, no loose DVD.  GREAT!<br /><br />Movie itself, well, not a classic, it is a great buy if you like horror/action and or B movies (lets be honest).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book.  A must read.  You can not put it down.  It ends with a cliff hanger that makes it impossible not to download the 2nd book immediately.  HOT! HOT! HOT!  I do not normally read this genre of book but so glad that I did not miss this one.  Almost finished with the 3rd and already wanting more.
B005RUV6RO|5.0|Walking Dead is the most believable of all zombie/vampire apocalypse series/films. I cannot recommend this series enough. Great cast, and they actually kill off characters, instead of everyone always escaping.
B005OK722U|4.0|The movie arrived on time and well packed.  The box had no damage to it - the was reflected by the fine quality of the the DVD inside.  The movie itself is a solid buy for the price.  I will not give anything away, but I must say that the movie is solid and is better than the second.  There is some nudity and as expected, it has a fair amount of gore.  Over all the more is great for any fan of this franchise or the SAW movies.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I started out this book wondering if I should actually read it.  I'm so glad I did!  Riordan has done it again!  I highly suggest you read the Lightening Theif series before you start this series.  That way you know what everything is about.<br />We are thrown back into the exciting greek mythology genre.  Riordan does an exceptional job with twists and turns throughout the novel.  We are introduced to Jason a demi-god who has lost his memories. And his friends Piper and Leo. I won't go too much in detail because giving it away would lose the surprise of this novel.  The other thing to know is the second Great Prophecy...\\"Seven half-bloods shall answer the call To storm or fire, the world must fall An oath to keep with a final breath, And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death\\"  With that I highly recommend this book no matter how old you are.  As an 18 year old I have come to greatly love this series.  They recommend this book for the 'younger' young adults but honestly Riordan made it so that even I, an adult, enjoyed, loved, and laughed with this book.  The last page of this book totally threw me off gaurd.  I literally could not think of anything else.  I was baffled.  And I LOVE books that do that... ones that make me think.  Right as soon as I finished it I re-read it! Knowing what was coming at the end made the second reading of it even better.  Riordan thought of everything.<br />Seriously you should read this book!  Enjoy!

B007SSDS24|4.0|Some alien invasion movies are cheaply made and have bad actors, this is not one of them. The acting was awesome and the movie rarely slowed down. It never got boring. I really enjoyed it and intend to buy it. I recommend this movie if you like alien movies.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Andrea, James, Abbey, and Oscar were brilliant and exciting to watch. people need to judge the film and not Madonna.  This film deserves so much better from critics.  View it with an open mind as you would any new director and understand what was trying to be accomplised.  Bravo Madonna and Alex...well done!
B006XF5BTG|3.0|I saw this rated highly under kindle books and downloaded it to my phone. I couldn't stop reading it once I started: I read it last night. I learned a lot about what I thought already knew, and despite the fact that I currently don't have time to keep track of everything I eat, it made me realize how much time I have to put into planning and preparation to reach my fitness goals. Matthews is down to earth and manages to explain simple concepts in a way that doesn't insult the reader's intelligence, but rather had me rethink what I thought I knew... I'm starting the workout routine today... excited to try out the new rep/sets routine, and reevaluate my form.<br /><br />Thanks Michael!<br /><br />..................................................<br /><br />I had to go back and change this rating.<br />Here's why: the workout routine is not meant for everyone. As much as we would like to believe that one set/rep/rest and exercise choice will fit all, it just isn't so. The workout routine just did not stimulate my muscles in a way that was satisfying. I am sure that it works for some people, just not for me. I can see this working in some kind of periodization or other type of program, but not year round.<br /><br />One thing that this did do was allow me to focus on my form.<br /><br />I still think that a lot of the scientific background and diet and cardio tips were great!
B004124VG2|5.0|The melancholy electronic sound of \\"I Walked\\" is what drew me into this album.  As I listen to this album over and over, it is always conjuring up new feelings within me.<br /><br />The lyrical content is very heavy and inspiring.  I think that most people can connect to the content in some shape or form.  It digs deep into humanity and the emotions that make us the imperfect beings that we are.<br /><br />I find it to be an extremely deeply introspective album.  As with Illinoise, I do consider this a concept album, with Sufjan's own personal humanhood being the central theme.  The layering of the traditional instruments with the electronic elements and hauntingly chilling background vocals is pretty amazing.  This album is certainly not \\"accessible\\" for the casual music listener and will be much more appreciated if you go into it with a discerning ear.<br /><br />The journey beings with \\"Futile Devices\\", which is probably the most regularly \\"structured\\" track on the album.  The high points (or low points, depending on how you look at the content of the tracks) to me are \\"Age of Adz\\", \\"Vesuvius\\", the amazingly explosive and goose-bump inducing \\"I Want to be Well\\", and obviously the epic composition \\"Impossible Soul\\".<br /><br />The album would be complete if it ended with \\"I Want to be Well\\".  I feel that \\"Impossible Soul\\" is almost a summary version of the ten tracks preceding it.  It's one of Sufjan's most complex and most beautiful compositions.  And it's extremely LONG.  It's more of a song medley with about 6 or 7 different songs combined into one track.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing this on vinyl.  This is such am amazing album.  This is definitely one of my favorite albums of all time.<br /><br />To me, it's a huge deviation from Illinoise and even the more recently released \\"All Delighted People EP\\", but this shows you the depth of Sufjan's compositional abilities mixed with his creative brilliance.

B004P95A8E|4.0|Upgraded design is nicer than the older Lego version of this Clone era starfighter.  It would be nice if Lego came out with a combo pack that had 2 Geonosian fighters as well as a clone forces ship to challenge them.  Overall, great addition to the Star Wars line-up.
B000001GAM|5.0|Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 9 is discussed more often than performed. Should the final two movements for which we have the composer's sketches be 'realised' and included in performance or is the final work of this Romantic giant complete as it stands? One listening to the majestic, spiritually uplifting symphony and the answer seems obvious: the symphony IS complete. Bruckner was one of the more misunderstood composers in history and much of that was due to the fact that he was an apparently simple organist, devoted to God, with a penchant for wooing young, poor maids, and a man so sensitive to criticism that he spent much of his life re-writing his symphonies in response to 'suggestions' from his colleagues and critics, an attribute that labeled him an idiot savant composer well into the 20th Century. His symphonies are indelibly stamped with his personal language - episodic, frequent climaxes of such power that the sudden reversion to quiet pizzicato strains at the peak of his musical mountains can be jarring; his love and use of German landler that serve to ground his monuments to heaven with patches of the countryside of earth; his quotations from Wagner, etc.<br /><br />But well over a hundred years since his death his extraordinary gifts as a symphonist are held in awe and most orchestras have made his works a staple in their repertoire. All but the mighty 9th. Fortunately this magnum opus is gaining more frequent playings by important orchestras and conductors: Simon Rattle just gave us his examination and majestic performance with the LA Philharmonic, revealing once again how he can reveal hidden secrets in the massively romantic symphonies. The recording here is by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra with Carlo Maria Giulini conducting and is a joy in every way. The pacing of the symphony is astute, the joyful 2nd movement with all of its references to Bruckner's earlier symphonies is played with a magnificent range of sonics, and the intensely spiritual 3rd movement with all of the uses of the Dresden Amen melodies builds in awe-inspiring intensity like a heart bursting with longing and acceptance of life on earth ending. The symphony ends in a gentle exhale of stunned quiet, the release of the spirit from the corporeal body. This 1989 performance is as spiritual experience of this symphony a is available on recordings. The Vienna Philharmonic is up to its highest standards of playing and Giulini lets the symphony breathe. Highly recommended.

B0029OYPLK|4.0|I received the DVD version of this concert a few days ago. I'm still listening to it while I write this. For Clapton/Winwood fans, the concert on DVD is a 5-star epic, and I'm glad I got it first, as it has several advantages over the MP3 album. For that reason, I only gave the MP3 album 4 stars. In fact, I bought the MP3 version today just so I could burn it to CD and listen to it on the road. However, I have already discovered that it omits or interrupts some nice moments that are included on the DVD, especially the drum click introduction to \\"Split Decision\\" (which, by the way, is one of my favorite tracks on this project). Also, comments between the songs on DVD give one a perspective for the history shared by EC and SW, and the reasons they chose the individual songs for this concert.<br /><br />As other reviewers have indicated, the DVD shows SW switching between guitar, organ and piano, and illustrates the interaction and camaraderie between the two stars. I knew that SW could play several instruments, but if I had purchased the MP3 version first, perhaps I would not have realized that he is probably no less capable on guitar than on keyboard. His keyboard artistry is especially evident on organ [incidentally, in my opinion, Billy Preston was the ultimate rock/blues organist], while his guitar lead on \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" gave me the feeling that EC had some competition on stage. The DVD also showcases the supporting cast of musicians, who complement the headliners quite well. For example, when SW goes to the organ, the keyboard player gets to show his prowess on synth - a Yamaha DX-7 II, which I recognized immediately because I have one and still play it from time to time - and when SW plays piano or guitar, the keyboard player gives solid organ backing. The drummer is awesome, and the bass player knows what he's doing or he wouldn't be on the stage with EC and SW.<br /><br />As an added bonus, this concert, although in a sense nostalgic for me, introduced meto some of the repertoire of both musicians with which I was unfamiliar.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you have to have this concert, get the DVD first, then decide if you want both.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Worked great for me, however I've played these type of games before so I knew how to play.<br />For those that don't, you tap the sides of the screen to move to different screens. You also tap the screen on anything that looks strange or to look in something. the game will tell you if there is anything wrong there or if you need to keep it in mind. hope that helps.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game just wish energy was earned faster. very interesting  game though. very addictive.  pretty good graphics. tasks are pretty easy to complete.

B001E45XT4|4.0|I'm very happy with these head phones. Sound is great, fit and feel are very comfortable, mic sounded good on test recordings no complaints. They don't cancel out background sound when listening but didn't want them to. Feels like a solid build, very happy with my purchase.
1934030198|1.0|This book was a waste of my time and money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone...novice or veteran triathletes. I would recommend...anything other than this book!
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book, like many others after hearing all the buzz. I enjoyed it greatly, while not my normal reading, the book is a love story (strange as it sounds). I found it addicting, waiting to find out what happens to Ana. Take this book for what it is entertainment. People should not be so up in arms over the sexual content. If so, perhaps they should skip these books. Loved it!!

0385474547|5.0|I had never heard of this book or this author before, and I was lucky enough to spot this at a used book fair recently.  I picked it up, read the cover - it sounded very interesting - and decided to spend one dollar and give it a try.  I have just finished reading it and I absolutely loved it and can't stop thinking about it.  I can see why this book is so highly acclaimed and I plan to check out more of his writing.  The story made me feel very sad for the Ibo culture and how it and their belief system was changed by the arrival of the white missionaries.  Everyone has their own culture and belief system, and I really wonder if the Christian system is any better or worse that what the Ibo people had.  Not only that, I found the daily lives of the pre-missionary Ibo very peaceful, simple, and ritualistic.  This seemed to have all been ruined by the arrival of the outside world, which I suppose was inevitable, and I also suppose this to be one of the main points of the story.  This sort of invasion has happened countless times in history, of course, and being from the US I can't help but draw parallels with the Europen settlement of this country and how the Native Americans were treated.  I realize that Things Fall Apart is a work of fiction, and somewhat fableistic, but I believe a lot of it accuratly portrays life in a Nigerian village in the late 1800s or early 1900s.  Reading this book has really carved another facet in my undersatnding and appreciation of the world.    The line at the end of the book was very powerful and unexpected.  It led me to the following informative resource: [...]l  From there, you can delve as deeply into an anlysis of the book as you like.    It is interesting, to me, that after reading this book, I mentioned it to an African American man with whom I have worked in the same company for many years.  It turns out that he grew up in a very similar village (he is >60 years old), in fact just a few miles from Achebe's village, and knows himpersonally. My colleague told me that this book was required reading diruing his high school days in Nigeria, and that his village was life was similar to that portrayed in the book.  What a truly small world we live in.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is a spectacular story about a successful escape from a North Korean prison camp. Often, when reading a dramatic story written by a second person (journalist), the content becomes flat and uninteresting. This effect impacts the reading experience also in this case, particularly during the first part of the book. Surprisingly, in the end this comes out not only negative. The authors clear engagement and prolonged relationship to the main person gives us a deeper insight in the psychological aspects of people experiencing such a dramatic life. The drama does not end at escape - it only change character. Exiting reading - could not stop reading before reaching the last page.
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVE THESE BOOKS, 1,2,3.. THEY WERE WORTH THE MONEY... SHORT BUT SWEET TOT HE POINT  I LOVE THESE BOOKS..
0785162348|5.0|I received this amazing book yesterday, i'am from Italy so i have already seen the movie on April 25 it's a great comic film.This book is a reflection of what you see on screen, i collected all of previous art books,and also this one is excellent. Is divided on chapters with characters art,arms,vehicle,film posters, promo art, merchandise, different locations, and chitauri development. Also this one is on a high quality slipcase. For me is a 5 stars book, for every Marvel comics fans to have.
B0000019P9|5.0|I am 51, but when I hear this, I am 18 all over again... and that is so significant that I give you this:<br /><br />About a week ago, my son--who actually is 18--was playing his vinyl copy of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea while I was easing in to my Sunday morning.  I wasn't able to give it my full attention then, but I immediately sensed that this album just possibly could live up to the hype that seems to grow each year, despite its age (13+ years) and the fact that Jeff Mangum never produced a follow-up (usually a bad sign).<br /><br />Later that evening, I converted the free download that comes with the vinyl and burned a CD for my Monday morning commute.  My drive at 6:00am is roughly 45 minutes, in the dark, relatively empty road, excellent sound system, perfect for a concentrated listen.  Maybe it was my mood, maybe it was the isolation, who knows, but I must tell you that, while I didn't actually cry, I wanted to.  Rarely have I been so taken, so unexpectedly, by an album.  I was immediately transported back to the 70s and all of the hope and promise and fear and awkwardness that was my teenage years. This is the kind of album that captures what it feels like to be vital, alive, full of passion.<br /><br />I like to think that I have listened to over 95% of all of the \\"important\\" albums of the rock era, but somehow I missed this beautifully raw masterpiece.  The only other time I can recall a similar feeling is when I finally discovered Big Star (about 20 years too late).  I haven't read the other reviews here.  I imagine they will tell you that it is similar to this, or that, and I guess that sort of advice is useful if the comparison LP is one you like, but if not, you should not let that keep you from giving this album an honest listen (no distractions, no miserable YouTube audio quality).  I mentioned Big Star, and I must admit that the collective impact of #1Record/Radio City and 3rd/Sister Lovers was similar for me (perhaps the only other time I havebeen unexpectedly emotionally stunned).<br /><br />If you like pretty music, or precision in the studio, or lyrics that are easily grasped and understood, this might not be for you.  But if you are a disciple of the singer-songwriter world created by Bob Dylan, a world more akin to Art than popular music, you should check it out.  Actually, if you are still uncertain, here is a list of my favorite artists (copy/pasted from my Google+ profile).  If you find a good number of these artists on your playlist, that is probably a good sign: (mostly in order -- younger artists at the end) Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Prince, Neil Young, Pink Floyd, Elvis Costello, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Jimi Hendrix, R.E.M., Radiohead, U2, Nirvana, Tom Petty, Bob Marley, Jackson Browne, Jethro Tull, Maria McKee/Lone Justice, Steve Earle, Dwight Yoakam, Wilco, Conor Oberst/Bright Eyes, The Avett Brothers, The Low Anthem...

B004XDYJRU|5.0|I cannot say enough how much I love this app! Moving from the south to another state where I turned the radio on twice and never turned on again because here the radio offers little variety and their idea of music is entirely different than mine is this app brings me complete joy! Thank you to the creator for coming up with this and allowing me to enjoy everything from soul and blues to hip hop and r&amp;b anywhere I go. Makes living in a place that lacks variety and culture much easier. I listen to this at work, home, in my car, and during the process of completing some of my college homework. My only wish is that I could stream it through my home theater system. I recommend this for anyone that can't afford to buy an excessive music library or that stays on the go.
