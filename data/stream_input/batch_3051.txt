B001KZG99A|4.0|Movie was enjoyable to watch. The action was good and the special effects were consistent with other movies in this genre. I'm looking forward to seeing Ironman 2.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You realy should get this game! When it came out on the kindle I was so happy! also here is a little tip always get your games from amazon.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I chose five stars because Applause is the best song I have heard lately. She blows almost all of the other popular musicians out of the water. The only problem I have with her is that I am not a fan of her image. It would be nice if she would just present herself naturally ( my personal preference). I guess it is just how she expresses herself artistically. You really would not think someone who looks like she does in the image for the song would make catchy music like this. She must have been quite a shock to the managers who discovered her.<br /><br />I highly recommend the song. It is interesting to listen to, seems true to who she is, and makes me want to hear more from her.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does not play that well with my apple products but still gets the job done. Its pretty amazing that i can connect everything with this to my television and I hope they are able to get more apps. This doest get rid of my roku but hopefully soon it will.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books in the series and<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT#########I was devastated by what happened to Tris in the end.  It was done by some bureaucrat that we never learned much about?  Better it have been meaningful, like with Tris and Will.  It's silly, I know, but I've been crying about it since I finished it last night.  Seriously, zombie movies end with everyone happier.  ########<br /><br />As others have said, the alternating narrators was distracting and I often couldn't tell who was speaking.  What was the who l e underground techno lab about. They go below and all of a sudden you are in a coffee house/bar with flashing club lights and a band? No purpose at all.  Oh, it was never explained why Joanna had that facial scar. We are told whenever she appears about her covering it with her hair. Come on.
0451232852|5.0|This book has a Jeffrey Archer feel about it, a sweeping story of several families from England, Germany, USA and Russia who are gradually brought together by fate, luck, or circumstances. It covers the period from 1900 until 1923, with much of the focus on the Edwardian period up to the beginning of the First World War, and then a significant section covering the war itself. The period 1918 to 1923 is a brief few chapters at the end.<br /><br />The author uses an interesting mix between fictional characters who participate in real historical events, intermingled with real-life characters, such as the Foreign Secretary Edward Grey and the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill.<br /><br />I loved the pace of the book, and found it very hard to put down. You felt swept along in the tide of inevitable destruction that was awaiting this generation as it entered the First World War. The author creates a real sense of helplessness that everybody felt, intermingled with incredible naivete that led to the most destructive of wars.<br /><br />The historical elements of the book have clearly been well researched and presented in a way that anybody who is looking for a broad overview of one of the most important periods of the 20th century will gain significantly from reading this excellent book.
B00EIMJVOM|2.0|You shouldn't have to purchase a deluxe edition album in order to get decent tracks.  This entire CD is mediocre.  Her voice is strong, but the songs are cheap.
B00E34A9FU|3.0|Much has been made about the 41-year delay in this concert audio being commercially available.  Evidently it was tied up legally all this time due to the fact that it was considered a \\"soundtrack\\" to movie footage that was shot that day.  The liner notes to this CD/DVD package say that this particular show is the most-demanded for release of any show in the band's history.  Several decades worth of that anticipation is a lot for this show to live up to.<br /><br />So does it?<br /><br />Well, not really.  It's a pretty solid show, and gets better as the sets go on, but I've heard many, many shows that--taken as a whole--easily surpass this one.<br /><br />(cue partisan shrieks and howls now, and then sample them for Halloween party usage).<br /><br />Much is made in the lore and liner notes about the hot sun that day, beating down on the crowd and the band.  Throughout disc #1 of this 3-disc set, the band (Jerry very much in particular) sounds wilted in the heat and the tempos are really sluggish.  Vocals are ragged, and the band generally (and for all I know, very reasonably) sound like they're about to keel over.<br /><br />Somewhere around the middle-improv of \\"Playing in the Band,\\" which starts off Disc #2, the tempos pick up to where they should be and the music gets more solid.  The band starts to hold things together significantly better, but it's still--at that point--just a workmanlike show.<br /><br />The \\"Donna Problem\\" is very severe, at several key spots throughout the show (eg. throwing a wrench into terrific versions of \\"Greatest Story....\\" and \\"Sing Me Back Home\\").  No need to go into detail about this, because we all know how many great '70s shows are marred by Donna's inexplicable, loud out-of-tune ad-libs.  Subtle as a sledgehammer.  It's hard for me to understand how someone who showed such a great voice on \\"Sunrise\\" off the Terrapin Station album could be so consistently out of tune and tin-eared at times during so many shows.  Surely her monitor mix wasn't that out of whack every time!  Anyway, enough about that.<br /><br />Weir is cranky and petulant throughout, bitching to the sound guys and grousing about the heat.  In my humble opinion, if he's going to make the band play \\"Black-Throated Wind\\" (which the band dutifully does, although it's a song whose weird chords and chord progressions make absolutely no sense at all), then he should be thankful and a little more gracious. At the end of disc #2, Weir says that the band is going to wait until the sun goes down, then come back out for another set.<br /><br />And then comes disc #3.  The break from the heat must have really done them some good, because this final set is miles better than anything that came before it.  The \\"Dark Star\\" that opens the set is as sublime and subtle as any I've heard the band do.  It's almost like the players know they didn't do all that well earlier in the day, and they're determined to make up for it.  All the players listen to each other like a hot-rod jazz combo, taking chances but always keeping it together, not wanting to be the one to let down the side.  By the end of the song, they're taking the improv into some aggressive areas that really work to build up to a climax.  Absolutely fantastic.  Getting this set is worth it for this song alone.<br /><br />\\"Sing Me Back Home\\" is very well done (but for the aforementioned Donna squawking that shoots out of the speakers at a couple of points and ruins the mood), as is \\"El Paso.\\"  And \\"One More Saturday Night\\" has all the energy that was lacking in the earlier parts of the show.<br /><br />I'll leave it to others to speak to the DVD portion of the package, but I hope this gives you a non-partisan idea of this show before you lay down your hard-earned $ for it in these tough times.  I have to admit (and this is my own fault, really) to letting the overly-high reviews of the partisans on this webpage sway me into the purchase.  If I had to do it again, I'm not sure I would.But that \\"Dark Star\\" is pretty darned terrific.....maybe best ever.

B004X6PRO6|1.0|I expected more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.  The characters were bland and the plot dragged.  It did not hold my interest.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Historical fiction at its best.  Look at one orphan's life from leaving Ireland to New York to taking orphan train to family out west.  Shows how poor placements were and how little research was done on families who took orphans in.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I enjoy watching the Vampire Diaries on TV. If you're a Vampire Diaries fan and watching the series once is not enough then you should purchase the series on DVD. I think this was a great buy.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and challenging. I was so glad it finally became available on the kindle. Wish it didn't take so long to get more lives.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I love Grey's, even thought Season 8 was lacking...  Season 9 picks up the pace and loses the corny feeling I got from the season before.  New characters, new story lines and plenty of action.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|It's been a long time since a series took over my life, but this one did. I could not put it down and read straight through all 5 books less than a week. Alexia is a fantastic character, the action moves along incredibly fast and there's great lines on every page.

0385350864|1.0|The antics of Bridget Jones have always amused me. We are after all the same age and we had a lot in common.<br />The book starts with pudgy Bridget losing an enormous amount of  weight ( 100 pages of the funny antics of this event, a bit draw out) and longing to find a companion, her poor fabulous husband having met his demise.<br /> At her age she has very young children and from all the reading I did she has absolutely no peri-menopausal or menopausal symptoms. She is as sexy and her behavior is the same as when she was 30. Please Miss Fielding , we are not this stupid. This woman should be too tired to even think of doing half of what she does.The whole premise of this book is ridiculous. Miss Jones, grow up! Your stupid antics are no longer charming.<br />This perhaps may be one of the worst, stupid and ridiculous book I have read in a long time.Don't waste your money.
0375869026|5.0|After my husband and I read the first chapter, we knew it would be a great book.  Our daughter and grandson read it aloud together.<br />As I said, I heard about it on NPR, or would never have known it existed.
0788859544|5.0|One of the best Disney movies.  A true-to-life teenaged mermaid wants to experience love and the other world.  After a deal with a sea witch she has to fight hard for everything.  It's Disney with a touch of real life teenager.  Great story and art.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Excellent action flick. The plot is thin and the actors mostly unknown, but the quality of the production and CGI make up the difference.  Only issue for me was the dialog was hard to follow with internal accents against the background noise.  I would watch it again.
006202406X|5.0|It was honest and true, I did cry my eyes out.....everything is life is not happily ever after.  Great series
B004EWFUQY|3.0|I gave this book a 3 because it was well written and made a lot of sense, however my husband and I felt so bad after 3 days that we had to discontinue the diet.  I had a horrible, pounding headache and my husband just felt very tired and bad all around.  The book said to expect lethargy, bad breath, etc. but nothing about a horrid headache.  No medications would make it go away.  This is a good idea in theory and a lot of people have given it rave reviews but we had to stop.  The Vietnamese Beef recipe was delicious, by the way.  We are switching to the sensible diet - lean meats, whole grains, vegies, a bit of fruit and lots of water and walking.
B008Y6SLL2|5.0|Great Movie. Kevin Spacey is once again GREAT in his portrayal of a caring stockbroker - do those exist? Highly recommend this flick.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very intuitive and fantastic. Often I type repetitive sentences so it is a big help! I use it every day, perfect for multiple languages switching seamlessly from one language to the other.

0553386697|5.0|Easy reading for parents and professionals. I've been a follower of Dan Siegel for years and highly recommend this book if you want to nurture healthy child development.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is deep and really a bit hard to get into, but it's all correct. I'm trying to live by the premises he puts forward, but then I forget and get lost in my own problems and I forget. This book will help you analyze your life and determine whether things that go wrong are your fault or due to some other facet of your life. This book in humbling.
B000I186FW|5.0|Great movie everyone should see it really makes you think about life and ask questions you wouldn't normally ask yourself or about the world
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|Katy Perry has done it again. She brings back a different sound and keeps those meaningful lyrics that captivate her fans.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great read, it jumps all over the place. Although the movie was good, little in common is shared with the book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game...just wish you didn't have to purchase levels or wait three days to play them.  Very addictive game that is fun to play
B00F0349LS|5.0|My favorite Placebo since Sleeping with Ghosts. With the possible exception of the somewhat grating &#34;Too many friends&#34;, it's a listen-straight-through album, unlike some of their earlier hit and miss releases.

1442362537|3.0|I’m a total Stephen King newbie, so when I first decided to dive into his book of works I started at the very beginning with Carrie and was an immediate fan. Next up was Salem’s Lot and then finally The Shining which became an instant favorite. His books in print already have that creepy effect that manages to latch on to your insides, but listening to the audiobook really took the terror to the next level for me. Since it was a recent read, I was fairly shocked to hear about a sequel coming out especially when you consider The Shining was originally released in 1977. Albeit, I was on board and full of anticipation.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep picks up shortly after The Shining’s explosive (literally) ending with Danny and his mother residing in warm and sunny Florida desperately trying to overcome the trauma they endured in Colorado. Danny is still haunted by the rotting corpse-like ghosts of the Overlook and essentially compels him to enlist the help of Dick Hallorann, the chef from the Overlook. He gives him the only knowledge he has of controlling his psychic gifts, but Danny’s has always been strong so it only does so much.<br /><br />The book flashes forward in time to feature a middle-aged Dan Torrance who has followed the path of his father and is an alcoholic for the sole reason that it dulls the shine. An incident causes him to hit a rock bottom of sorts and we flash forward again by three years to find Dan working at a hospice, using  his gifts to aid patients in the transition between life and death. They call him Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />Next, we’re introduced to Abra Stone, a young girl who’s psychic abilities make Dan’s look like a parlor trick. We’re also introduced to a group of individuals that go by the name of the True Knot who travel the country in RV’s searching out children with gifts like Abra’s. They torture and kill the children so as to fully harvest the ‘steam’ that escapes their bodies upon their deaths. Abra is the strongest child they've yet encountered and she’s next on their list.<br /><br />Phew. That summary may have been long, but so was the book itself and had far more pages than was actually required. The middle lagged and the build-up to the ‘epic’ showdown between good and evil was fairly unsurprising. As highly anticipated as Doctor Sleep was for me, I can’t help but feel in the end that leaving The Shining as a stand-alone would have been far wiser.<br /><br />What worked well for The Shining was the true horror aspects. The isolation of The Overlook, the claustrophobic effects of the encompassing storm and the transformation of a loved one into a terrifying monster. (The rotting corpse in the bathtub definitely helped as well.) Doctor Sleep leans more towards the supernatural and fantasy aspects making it less real and giving it a very fabricated feel. I greatly disliked the vast array of pop culture references strewn throughout the novel. They served no obvious purpose and should have been edited out. Game of Thrones, Twilight, Sons of Anarchy and Hunger Games were among the few I caught. I did enjoy the references to characters from his son Joe Hill’s novel NOS4A2 though.<br /><br />While I was clearly left unimpressed, there were a few facets that I really enjoyed. I absolutely loved the beginning; it not only held promise but felt like a true sequel to The Shining. (The rest of the story veered a bit too far off track for my liking.) I loved the inclusion of Halloran and how we got to see the events following The Overlook without immediately jumping to Danny being middle-aged. It was fantastic to see the effects of The Overlook on Danny and how he grew up to be (and the almost inevitable fact that him and his Father ultimately took the same path). Tony also plays a part in the story as well as the original site of the Overlook is included. It was fantastic and I loved returning to those aspects of its predecessor, at least until the story took a sidestreet into Strangeville.<br /><br />Despite my issues with the book as a whole, the beginning bits were totally worth it. I listened to this on audio and narrator Will Patton did a fantastic job.street into Strangeville.<br /><br />Despite my issues with the book as a whole, the beginning bits were totally worth it.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book. Subject matter new to me. Not aware of  orphan trains or that they existed. The marvels of the internet truly connecting us to each other reaching beyond loneliness despair to acceptance. I would recommend it to all my reading friends and even to my non reading friends. Amazing how people endure life's challenges to become who they were meant to be...full circle achieved.
B00E3UN44W|5.0|SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />I was so excited to receive this DVD I could hardly maintain my composure as I tore into the box with trembling hands! Ah, what joy to finally see \\"how Sherlock did it\\" and who would have guessed at this?!  (Yes, well, actually several people did predict the TARDIS pool would be his salvation, but it's the WAY he landed, right on top of River Song, oh my!) And the scene where he grabs John by the moustache, ha! That will keep fangirls busy for months and months!!  And when Mary is slain by a crazed group of Sherlock's fans, oh the angst! The tragedy! Once again Martin Freeman proves he is the ultimate mourner, there was not a dry eye in my house, I'll tell you that! OK enough, I am off to watch episode three yet again to see if there are any clues I may have missed that would tell us how Sherlock is going to rescue John from THIS horrible predicament! Who would have guessed that Lestrade was actually... well, never mind.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Great movie! Gonna make a perfect stocking stuffer this Christmas for an unsuspecting girl! I'm just hoping she's avoiding the temptation to also purchase it!
B00DHRLK84|3.0|like All zombie movies, it's does not have a good story and not enough action. Brad always does a good job, which will keep you watching, but by the end of the movie you will be left unsatisfied. :-(
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I bought the set for my husband who is a BRUCE FANATIC and he loves it.  I like them also.  If you like Bruce or simply like me, want to find out what all the fuss is about, this seems like a good set to get.

B00C76076C|5.0|I've been telling my 3-year old about this movie for awhile.  We sing the songs, read books, and now FINALLY I can show her the movie.  Watching it again brought back so many memories and I loved it today as much as I did at 10!  Even found myself teary eyed at the end!  Great Disney Movie!
B005F9CPG8|5.0|BROUGHT BACK SOME GOOD MEMORIES. If you are looking for the old song that they had in the beginning middle and end this is a nice one. I love Let it be, and had forgotten how much I enjoyed a few of the other song.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|I haven't been able to stop listening to this since I got it yesterday morning. It rocks, it rolls, it tears your eardrums out. Lemmy, Phil, and Mikkey are in top form on this album (not saying that they haven't been lately, I'm just saying they're keeping the ball a'rollin) I really love this album. So far it's my favorite. And the cover-art is the best, I just have to keep looking at it it's so cool. but seriously this album CRANKS. GET IT! you wont be disapointed trust me. PLAY IT AND WATCH YOUR NEIGHBORS LAWNS DIE! lol =]
1574214276|3.0|I expected better after reading all the good reviews about it being one of the best tangle books out there. I am new to tangling and want a book to show me lots of new interesting tangles but the tangles in this book aren't very new and original for the most part (80%). I came up with a lot of them on my own without any book. Also, there are very few examples of how to take your creativity further (less than 15 pages of finished tangle art).
B003YNFYCO|5.0|The red albums are very good to listen too once again.  glad they have now been put into different casing, the plastic always breaking.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked this book.  Everything about it was well written and the characters were believable which is a plus and I liked that they were so personable and likable in their own ways.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|What a perfect climax to a perfect series. I couldn't help but feel what the characters were feeling. Although it did make me sad, it also ended very well. Thank you for a great book veronica!

B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|The premise of the story, about which you can read from the synopsis on Amazon, is timely;  domination of the internet (ipso facto, society) by a single monolithic company (the Circle)  endangers essential human rights.    The protagonist is a woman, a choice which I first believed was Eggers' conceit (\\"I can write as a woman\\"), but have come to see as serving a darker purpose.  Mae Holland is a gallimaufry:  she has no guiding principles, lacks any consistent motivation, and as many other critics here have opined, seems to exist to do nothing more than serve as a narrative tool for the plot.    Mae is an educated, intelligent young woman, who for some reason could do no better upon graduating from an exclusive college than to work for a terrible utilities company still functioning in the dark ages. Mae views the Circle (a company loosely based on Google) as  a workplace which serves as a gleaming contrast;  one she is literally willing to beg to work in.  She is seduced instantaneously by the appearance of the place, and is not the least put off by the Orwellian/Stepford-like qualities which manifest in abundance.    Eggers, a fairly young man, has no concept of how to narrate from the female perspective.  The way he describes Mae's ideas and ethos is ludicrous.  The scenes in which Mae is having sex provide a compelling example.  I know of no woman (being one of a certain age myself) who would, under ANY circumstances, describe the male anatomy using the word \\"crown.\\"  Eggers, an obvious proponent of the \\"man as king\\" motif, does--not once, but twice.  The second time, I literally said \\"ugh\\" out loud.    Though Eggers ostensibly abhors the Circle's mandate of domination, every female character is a caricature, a person subjugated to the desires of men.  Mae is driven primarily by her desire to serve and please men, both at work and in bed; in fact, her nearly incomprehensible desire to seduce and be seduced by repulsive males in the workplace regularly overwhelmsany concerns she has for her job.  Annie, Mae's friend and former college roommate, who gets Mae her job at the Circle, starts out as a dynamo who is ultimately reduced to a near-corpse; undone by vicious family secrets involving her parents' distasteful sexual conduct, among other things.  The other female characters, including a doctor, are described invariably as flirts and seductresses, existing primarily, despite their capabilities and credentials, as visual treats for their co-workers and the Circle's many \\"watchers\\".  I am not a person who looks for misogynists under every shrub, but one needn't search far to experience Eggers' manifest distaste for women.    The shark metaphor, wielded with the finesse of a caveman's club, is patently phallic.  \\"It was a bizarre creature, ghostlike, vaguely menacing and never still, but no one who stood before it could look away.  Mae was hypnotized by it, its slashing form, its fins like blades, its milky skin and wool-grey eyes.  It was certainly a shark, it had its distinctive shape, it's malevolent stare, but this was a new species, omnivorous and blind.\\" (Tellingly, the person whose job it is to  feed the rapacious creature in the story is a woman, tentative and frightened, who is described as perilously close to becoming its prey herself.)    Eggers'  fascination with penises and all they can and cannot do is a subject in which he invests a disconcerting quantum of energy.  The sexual aspects of this story are almost pornographic in their lack of context.  Why, for example, is it necessary for us to encounter Mae's mother on her knees in front of Mae's invalid, incontinent father, apparently about to be or engaged in performing some sex act involving his \\"limp penis\\" and a \\"bottle of moisturizer\\"?  Why do we need to discuss repeatedly and in detail Mae's hyper-undesirable lover, Francis', premature ejaculation issues?  Why is it necessary to describe Kalden forcibly taking Mae from behind, virtually anonymously, in a work toilet stall?  Why does Mae's ugly, obese ex-boyfriend have the opportunity to penetrate her as she clings to the edge of a cliff overlooking the Grand Canyon?  These scenes serve in only one way to advance the story:  women demand humiliation and domination.  It thus becomes clear that Eggers' choice of a compromised female protagonist is purposeful;  Mae is a character whom he can debase; whom he can portray as weak, vain, and corruptible.  Woman as unworthy gatekeeper.    This theme does not become fully evident until the final \\"Book.\\"  Because I don't want to give away the plot, I won't explain why.  Suffice it to say that whatever hopes I had for the novel to deliver in a substantive way, I was disappointed.    Having said that, I hope Eggers gets his obvious, deep-seated emotional issues worked out.  I know about his background, and while I have a great deal of empathy for his struggles, what matters to me as a reader is the quality of his work.  Ironically, though Eggers makes it clear in The Circle that he opposes immediate gratification and pandering to the lowest common denominator, I experience his writing as doing just that.  He is a man who has failed to plumb his own depths;  this can only mean that whatever he has ignored will continue to plague his literary efforts.  Until he knows himself well enough to acknowledge and grow from his failings and weaknesses, we will be forced to confront and deconstruct them in his generally superficial writing.  Freudians will have a field day, but the dedicated reader will be merely frustrated.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|For the most part I think this was a bunch of hooey but, there were actually a couple of well argued points.  Deists would like her attitude toward god and religion.
B001NB545Q|5.0|I really love The Who, and this is a great album, with some wonderful music on it.  Hope you enjoy it too.
1423136802|5.0|My boys and I all love this series, so I have been getting each one of them a set as they leave home.  Great gift.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Loved it!! It's been a long time since a &#34; good&#34; scarey movie was made. Awesome movie...jumps and bumps and great storyline!! Will watch again!!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Beautifully wrapped and ready for my 5 year old who is so excited to see her princesses on her wall. Great service and the product came right on time!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|You will not regret buying this book!!!! It was shorter than I expected but none the less a good read.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|The critics are already poking holes in Gladwell's science but, this is still a good read.  This is &#34;make you think&#34; reading not &#34;hang your hat on it&#34; reading.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Had this movie on my wishlist for a while but didn't have time to watch till recently. Glad i waited to watch in its entirety. Starts off a little slow but a must watch movie.
B0090SI460|5.0|I have tons of movies that I bought before they came with a digital copy.  Love that feature and fortunately for me I didn't have this one yet, so I was able to get the digital copy for the Ipad.
B0059QJ2D6|5.0|Unlike the American version, this original Danish film cuts to the emotional and intellectual quick with its Checkovian style. The US version is little more than a propaganda item of our military, a real cheapening of the excellent original story. Hollywood knows how to extract every last bit of good taste and toss it out the window. Ms. Susanne Biers has written a powerful piece of fiction. It’s easy to see how she won a Sundance Film Festival foreign film award. See this if you want subtle literature in film.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Everything on this disc fits. From Laurie's gravelly voice, the Copper Bottom Band and his backup singers. Puts you in a low-down mood! It's great!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it it's cool to make a world of your own. It gets awesome at high levels.so cool get the app
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A really great read in understanding an Afghani's point of view, and how life used to be there versus the way we view it now. Wonderful insight.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game ever, the only problem is that it doesn't have a warning before you begin playing, it's addictive , I'm up some nights at 3 in the morning trying to get to the next level
B002RI9UBS|3.0|lots & lots & lots of detail<br />i watched the movie instead as i was startting to get bogged down in parts of the book that didnt seem to be going anywhere
B0050DIWFC|4.0|There are so many issues here to ponder,moral,legal,soul searching. What would you do when faced with this? I was thinking one thing only to be surprised by the turn of events and then again! Stunning.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|As always this show delivers surprise after surprise they always find ways to keep your attention as there is always new directions the show heads in
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the season as a whole but didn't like the fact that there were two deaths in the family.
B005LAII4E|1.0|Really?  This Rise of Cobra introduced us to this interesting special forces unit -- cool weapons, hideouts and some acting(basic for these comic book type flicks).  But this one was just explosion after explosion.  No real story line.  Really boring to watch.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Being neither a zombie or Brad Pitt fan, I wouldn't have bothered except that a friend really liked and recommended it.  Being Halloween time, we thought, what the heck, and were pleasantly surprised!  The story line was a little out there (but we're talking zombies, so that's expected, right?) but Brad Pitt's character was great and somehow real and, dare I say, likable and sympathetic.  Now, if they could have just made the zombies a little less zombie-like!  The hissing and tongue wiggling was almost a Miley Cyrus moment.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|exactly as the title says.<br />The book narrates the wildly adventurous life of the main character who, by virtue of an &#34;oh well&#34; attitude & never really trying to do more than get home, he finds himself in some very historical moments in life. His explosives knowledge was his ticket to the world, when all he really wanted to do was be at home (albeit blown up some years earlier).... Meanwhile, the adventure continues & destruction follows him - but never really catching up.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|One of my favorite films, the movie and case were in good condition as promised.  I dont like writing reviews though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't believe I didn't know about this game before! I would constantly overlook it when I would be looking for new games for my Kindle. I actually discovered it after I purchased Disney's Brave game. I thought, &#34;Hmmm...this game is fun.&#34; Then, Amazon.com offered Temple Run 2 as a suggestion. Wow. So fun and easy to play. It is so thrilling to beat your previous runs. I love to use the coin magnet, especially in the coal car in the caves. Such a great app/game to get for free. Seriously. Give it a try. :) It's deceptively addictive and fun. You'll be hooked. I promise.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The best on tv right now. It's hard to compare to really. But some do come close, but not even
B00D3LA71K|4.0|The story kept you guessing how Mud would evolve or if he would through the movie.  McConaughey does a great job with this one.  I would watch again and recommend.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Baldacci's camel club always holds my attention cant wait for the next one.<br />they are quick reads because the plot is always different. the characters interesting.
B000002ITW|5.0|[Always meant to get this lp.  Thing is, they always played it on the radio back when, so you didn't have to buy it.  (Like &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34;).]<br />I enjoyed the lesser-known tunes as much as the familiar ones.  They were (and still are) at-home, soulful, direct -- enjoying the fullness of living, with all its discord, and writing about it. They are a time capsule of a feeling of freedom and mode of expression that doesn't seem to be in evidence much now.  They played and sang.  Moved the room.  Moved a generation.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book is written from both Tobias and trish's standpoint and it makes the first portion of the novel very hard to read. Also, it is like she was grasping at straws to piece together the ending of this trilogy. The story line just doesn't make sense at all.
0316017930|3.0|This is a great book- for entertainment.  Gladwell brings his thoughts together in a very entertaining way.  He effectively gets you to think about some interesting observations he makes in society.  You will start to consider some of what you previously thought.  On the other hand, do not expect to be overwhelmed by peer-reviewed academic research.  You won't find that here.  You will find simply and fun conclusions.  The book is worth the read.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|I like Sheryl's country style voice....Best CD she's done in a spell,,,,,,Her very first album will always be hard to top....
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|Definately a mystery that keeps you wondering whats next.  I may have to watch it a second time to get all the twists.  Some ubelieveable legal issues but it blends into the film.  Would strongly recommend.
B00EI6E17A|4.0|Very good debut song off the new forthcoming album, Artpop, by Gaga. It gets you moving around and dancing in no time. Gaga is back! Can't wait for the new album.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|There is only one &#34;Diva&#34; - Cher's music is awesome in this CD - enjoy every song. If you like her music - add this to your collection.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard. It's definitely my default keyboard. It's simple and easy to use. It even has a Swype type of setting if you're into that. I use this keyboard because I'm not into that.
0316010669|3.0|I read this book after reading Outliers.  I found a similar situation here.  The book is enjoyable to read as long as you are reading it for that purpose.  As with Outliers, this book is not an academic study of anything.  It draws interesting conclusions based upon random events and witnesses.  I did see one thing I could not overlook in this book.  It was clear that Gladwell had the idea and wrote the book, then he found situations and people to support his existing idea.  Sometimes it felt forced.  Regardless, if you want to be entertained, this is a fun book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love playing.  Tempted to speed things up and use money but find it more fun to earn it on this game and most of the items you can earn.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Enjoying app on home computer and smart phone. Nice to be able to open tablet and check weather forecast wherever I go.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart is what I would call an average length novel.  It is not a huge in depth novel like the wheel of time books but bigger than a novella.  From the time I started it pretty much everything took a back seat to it.  The characters have a great depth to them and the story has an appropriate number of twists and turns.  I would highly recommend this to anybody interested in fantasy lit.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I have really like Kelly Clarkson music - plan to add more of her music to my library.  Never get tired of listening to it.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|I don't know if this is history or not. But it sure is one of the best new tv shows of 2013. Watch the season in three days. Excellent cast, great story telling , maybe even informative.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I wasn't immediately grabbed by this book, in fact it was at the 25% mark that I actually got drawn in. There were a few parts that made me get angry, which is actually a good thing. I connected with the characters in such a way that I got upset when things didn't go exactly as I wanted. I guess the thing I felt was most lacking is any understanding as to why Emily thought suicide was the ONLY option left, I think this took away from the conclusion of the book. I had a &#34;I just don't get it&#34; feeling. But beyond that it was a pretty good read and by the time I finally got hooked I did have trouble putting it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to finally play my favorite game on Kindle.  The game runs flawlessly, as far as I can tell.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the fact that it's so fun but hate when I can't pass a board and its taunting you to pay....but I keep trying....passes the time away
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|There is nothing \\"new\\" with McCartney's current release. The CD is a compilation of the typical middle of the road tunes that we have all heard over and over again under different song titles on previous McCartney albums spanning the past 15 years or so.
1609611543|5.0|Although very scientific and technical, this book explains a lot about why America is so fat. From the issue of Dwarf Wheat, to the fact that wheat is in almost all commercially processed foods, and the explanation that gluten-free is not the solution for everyone, it can be a little overwhelming. I think Dr. Davis wants readers to know why the diet was developed and why it works for so many, so much if the information in the first few chapters is very clinical. He gives many case studies and sample recipes to help the novice get started. I appreciate that he also focused on eating a totally clean diet - eliminating all grains, HFCS, nitrates and nitrates, and of course sugar. i have had success following his advice over the last 2 months and the scale finally budged after many years of dedicated exercise and dieting through plans like LA Weight Loss that just don't work. My favorite line from the book: &#34;Rapid, effortless weightloss.&#34; Amen!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I really wish so badly that I could get this for free I tried it on an iPhone so yea
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I usually enjoy King's characters and their interactions. The story wasn't as gruesome as some of his novels, although it was disturbing at times. I thought it was light in the horror category for him.<br />He did a good job of reminding the reader of the plot of the &#34;Shining&#34; while keeping this book a stand alone story.<br />In summary, it was an entertaining novel by King.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I plodded through the first 36 chapters and absolutely NOTHING has happened yet! Not at all like his other books that I have read. Perhaps I will have another go at the remainder later this winter.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I just love this show. Can't wait for season 4. Never thought I could ever get into a show like this, but its great.
B00006JDVV|5.0|good movie, wouldn't watch it more than twice.  But was entertaining.  another addition to collection of movies.  slow at first.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game.  It is such fun. you don't want to quit but keep on for hours.
B009MYARIK|4.0|This book seemed a little flat. I never really empathized with either of these characters completely. It was probably because she switched voices so often.<br />I love some of her other works so much, and was just a little disengaged in this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thanks amazon I have been waiting forever runs great no glitches or anything your awesome king.com candy crush rocks,  5 out of five stars I love this game
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|great family movie.  Our 4 yr old loved this so much we actually ended up buying the DVD.  The humor is clean but clever enough to keep an adult's attention.  Cute story and characters and loved the sequence in the beginning where the USC marching band does the music when they are trying to grab that egg!
B00CATSONE|4.0|The book seems to be more about the general 'power of imagination' than a biography about Tesla. It does go into him though, and speaks to his visions, though the state in which his career ends sort of spoils the &#34;you can do anything&#34; tone of the book. That said, you do learn a few interesting things, and it is well written.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Animals are capable of so much more than most folks give credit for.  This is a god book for anyone of all ages to read and hopefully realize that they are far from &#34;dumb&#34;.<br /><br />I gave a four because the five will be when Bowen is free of addiction (with Bob's help of course) and his life is in order...to his own satisfaction.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It started off quite well; piqued my interest, but then it kind of became the same ol' same ol'. Two people lusting after one another eventually becomes boring to me and when the everlasting contract was drawn up and presented, that's when I stopped reading. It was way too long. I just lost interest. Not to say that I won't try reading it again, but being a writer myself, I want something with substance.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a surprise!  This is the first time I read this author and I enjoyed the book.  I was drawn right into the story.  Good book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|NEED I SAY MORE?... Lol:)) it cleaned my tablet and made it very simple,, I used it on my cell,, and it works for just about everyone I refer it to. Def happy with this app:))<br /><br />.......
B008PZZYB2|4.0|This movie made me laugh and was funny from start to finish...just a fun hood time movie with a hottie.
B00CI5ET7K|3.0|I hope this is not a trend for Joe. The last few albums have been &#34;slowing down&#34;. So I'm not sure what momentum he is referring to?  Since &#34;crystal planet&#34;  not much going on here :/
B00000K3CK|5.0|Excellent movie for the Christmas holiday. Stars Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Natalie Wood and Edmund Gwenn. This is the role for which Edmund Gwenn won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Notable appearances from Gene Lockhart and William Frawley (you may remember him from the TV show &#34;My Three Sons&#34;.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Nice variety of games that tests your brain!<br />Always nice to find something that challenges the mind!<br /> re commed this one
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie really flew under the radar but it is definitely worth checking out.  A rare uplifting movie in the post apocalyptic sci-fi genre with a positive message. Check it out.
B00EBJ624O|2.0|I probably will be in the minority here,but I did not like this performance.I myself was a professional pianist but I played Chopin,Brahms and Mozart due to very small hands that wouldnt encompass the scope of Rachmaninoffs concerti.But I knew how I wanted to play it and this isnt it! Yuja Wang has a phenomenal technique.Her passagework is fantastic.Every note glitters and is clear.But where is there a performance here! It is like listening to Aida played by a chamber orchestra.This is Russian music at its most passionate composed by a complicated and passionate man. There is no tension in the phrasing. At times the pianissimi are so soft that you are straining to hear Wang AND the orchestra.You cant play this as a series of effects.There is meant to be a build up and release of tension.This is a theatrical conerto.It shouldnt be played as if it was you are in church.I kept waiting for SOMETHING to touch me,SOMETHING to make my pulse get fast. The last few minutes almost make up for the insipid performance, but when the great final expansive melody begins you realize you are listing to the beautiful playing of the Simon Bolivar Orchestra, not Yuja Wang. Then right before the cascading downward runs of the piano Dudamel does a sudden slaming on of the brakes and then a nutty accelerando.NOT in the score...why? Its jarring and makes no musical sense.I must admit I have enjoyed Dudamels conductiong so much in the past, but here his conducting does not live up to his previous performances.Sound is O.K. If you want to hear this concerto played with equal technical wizardry, but with abondon and sweep, get Steven Hough on Hyperion.It may not be his \\"fach\\" so to speak but they are grand performances that carry you along. Also if you can locate the CD performance of Santiago Rodriguez and the Lake Forrest IL orchestra this also is wonderful.I cannot recomend spending money on this. There is more to great playing than effects,a beautiful cover shot and hype. Horowitz,Richter,Wild,Ashkenazy,etc. didnt need a fancy picture or hype.
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazing insight into what the traitors in the UN that support Agenda 21 are planning for the citizens of the world. I also enjoyed it for its cinematic and entertainment purposes as well. It gives you a glimpse of the very possible future, as well as very entertaining without critically assessing it. Well done.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Main character seemed forced into the plot and did not seem to develop naturally. Despite that, the book leave many little nuggets of suspense leading into the next book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Can stream video from ABC.com and YouTube fairly easily but not from WWW.HULU.COM . Had one show that was very choppy with the video while the audio just kept running. Still exploring it's capabilities
B00FR3WZKI|5.0|Each track is wonderful and stays true to the original.  My favorite remix, hands-down, is &#34;Love Is In Control&#34;, but they're ALL terrific and the remixers do a reat job of staying close to the original version and using Donna Summer's original vocals.<br /><br />Anybody who loves dance music or remixes, will certainly love this album.  It's truly a superior album.
1906735875|1.0|Black and white with cheap paper really hurts this title. The original was all about color and this format really loses something in the translation. Look elsewhere.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game fight with husband to play with it on kindle. Very challenging. Love playing. Spend a lot of time on this game.
006202406X|1.0|Let me start by saying I have absolutely loved this series. The writing was great and I thought the characters were very well developed. The plot was interesting and imaginative. It was thought provoking and action packed, but I feel like Allegiant ruined the entire series for me. It seemed to be a fun triumphant story, but the tragic ending was cold and abrupt and left me incredibly disappointed to the point where I wish I had never read it. I chose to read this series because it seemed uplifting- but this book certainly isn't- so if you like happy endings this book is definitely not for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|sweet fun in the sun or anywhere else. Good for all  ages male or female. good fun with a brain teaser added.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|This collection of Matrix films was a good value since it was less expensive than streaming all four movies over Amazon on Demand and the benefit is that you can watch them again.
006202406X|1.0|I was very disappointed as I am a fan of the first two novels. Not only was the plot confusing and the new characters extremely shallow and one dimensional, the \\"big shock ending\\" wasn't even necessary to the story. It felt like Roth just threw it in for shock value rather than an essential part of the plot. Before I began to read, I thought that the dual perspective of the novel would be interesting. However, it just demonstrated how Roth can't develop deep and individualized characters. Tobias's and Tris's thoughts and actions sounded exactly the same. Also, it felt like the themes of \\"racism,\\" \\"identity,\\" and \\"bravery\\" were shoved down my throat as they were repeated over and over. Unfortunately, I just can't give this book more than one star.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|Really under rated movie that flew under the radar. Definitely worth a look. Up lifting plot for a change in a post apocalyptic sci-fi thriller.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its a great game for being free.It is very fun.  I only wish there was a way to earn coins faster
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Perfect for my laptop and does not eat up a lot of space.  The space underneath is nice as well.
006202406X|2.0|That was aweful. I just wow I'm speechless with how inauthentic and rediculous it was.. I must know these charectera better than Roth.. Her ego got in the way of this one.. Utter disappointment
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thais is an escape game that will challenge you without making you feel stupid. I enjoyed every level and finished the game feeling clever! Make more levels!

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|This is the third time I have read this series and I find new twists with every read! Definitely recommended reading!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|My feelings about this book are complicated like most people who have finished it. The first part was a little slow developing but I had no trouble reading it. There were times I wanted to slap some of the characters (Four, I'm looking at you.). Overall, I enjoyed the book even with its ending. The ending left me devastated but I thought it followed the storyline and fits with what we know of the characters and their personalities. I'll be honest, I figured this would happen. Just think about it people. Think about the previous books.<br />Will I be rereading this one? Probably not. Would I have enjoyed it more if it had had a happier ending? Probably. But overall I am satisfied with how it ended.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app was so helpful it had really helped me to not run my battery super low. I really like this app
006202406X|1.0|is this book is a joke?  just consider book 2 the series endgame. what a disappointment for so many loyal fans. leaves plenty of room for fanfic authors to end the story properly.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I really hope they will consider doing another movie, and catch us up on &#34;Mr. Big&#34;.  As much as I like the girls, he is a huge part of the show.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I thought this novel was excellent. I particularly was very interested in the idea that someone would try to put an equation on romance since I particularly enjoy math, but I think John was right--such an equation cannot be made. I love John Green's writing, how he can have his characters make dumb jokes like normal teenagers, and yet he writes such deep profound thoughts and recognizes that yes, teenagers have these kinds of thoughts too. He is a very thoughtful author, and I think this book continues to reflect that. I'd recommend it to anyone, really. An Abundance of Katherines is a wonderful read.
B000784WMW|2.0|I watched and compared three versions of Jane Eyre movies.<br />The best one is the one with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. They give a superb performance as Mr, Rochester and Jane, They reflect closely the characters and personality described in the book. Also the locations and Thornfield Hall are more like one would expect from the descriptions in  the book.<br />The version with Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska is too far from the book. There are major omissions of  important characters (like Mrs. Grace Poole)  This  make the story quite incomplete. The performance of the main characters is too rigid and not showing the emotions one would like to see.<br />The version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke is the worst one. Zelah Clarke is too old for the part, she is not the slender and small young girl you would expect from the description in the book On the contrary she is chubby and  she doesn't show at all in her performance the emotions she should . Also the locations are all too fancy and far from the type of environment people would  imagine from the descriptions in the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend the version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens as the most accurate and better executed of the three.<br />The screenplay is the best and the closest to the book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Have on my kindle and works great. Good game and I don't spend any money. A good game to spend time on and cool if great liked the movie.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I'm not into romance novels and I did not read very much of the book.<br />If you like romance novels this is probably a generic read.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|His music is amazing and speaks to the heart. He was a talented musician and vocalist and when he sings and plays his ukulele it is as if he is playing and singing from his heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very addicted to this game. Thank you for finally getting it on the kindle fire! I am playing on here, my phone and the computer.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is more than a search and seek game.  It makes me not want to stop playing.  I found myself addicted to it within the first few seconds. It captivated me.  Never have I played a game that stimulated me the way this game does.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Stephan King . Good development of characters. Just the right amount of scary. The baseball boy section haunts me still - weeks after reading.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love it! Works great! All those reviews are fake. Just go to your music folder, and then go to device, and there is your music!
B00355L2TU|4.0|I'm an avid cross-fit bootcamper but I recently went back to school in addition to working full-time and having a family. My crossfit schedule didn't fit into my lifestyle, but the 20 minute workout by Jillian Michaels does. I'm a big advocate for getting out of the house but during busy schedules, I think this is a good alternative.<br /><br />I've never had any problems with tendons, ligaments, etc. Maybe because I'm used to doing exercises that are strenuous on the joints.
006202406X|1.0|I just want to say that as a very passionate reader I am highly disappointed by the outcome of this series. I'm no teenager, but I do fall deeply into the books I choose to read. That was the case with all of the characters in this series, especially Tris and Tobias. It is merely my opinion that books in the YA genre are not meant to shock and wow, but rather send a message.<br />SPOILER<br />I understand that at the end Roth makes a feeble attempt at a message by Tobias moving on with life as Tris would have wanted, but I'm sorry, it is just not good enough. These kids (yes they were kids) went through so much pain, misery and letdown to get you to root for them to survive and then that? I don't think I will be anle to find it in myself to watch the movies now. Like I said, so sad and disappointed. Maybe ahe needs to swich over genres to adult drama because that may be a little more appropriate.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|this series is good but I am seeing some pretty bad writing towards the end of this season. I fear they may be wrapping things up. Actors are good actors though.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Joan Jett is a fine artist,  music and lyrics are always rated as made with the best quality in the music industry.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I am an old John Legend fan.  During his last couple of albums, I wasn't really reminded of why I fell in love with him.  His first album was great and nothing has come close since until now.  I absolutely love this CD.  There may be one or two songs that don't stand out, but as a whole this CD is great.  Great work John!!!
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old son who is very much into both Minecraft and Legos.  We have the Original Minecraft Lego set we bough last year and he was thrilled to find out they made the Nether version.  This one completed our set of 3 Minecraft Lego sets that were released and he is beyond happy with them all.  He loves putting them all in a row and making the little Steve (from the Original set) walk through this one as the ghost chases him...lol ... We would definitely buy this again and will recommend it to his peers.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Very well made scifi action flick that treats superheroes as they should be treated. No 2d personalities or boomerang story plots that have a normal person becoming great and going back to normal again. This is taking the greats and having them throw down against a common enemy(and each other).<br />Instant classic here, despite the fact that Joss Whedon forgot a few earpieces in the final battle. [facepalm] It's so good you can overlook that snafu.Definitely a must see movie.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is one of those games you get addictive to, once you start playing you can't stop. If you get caught up easily don't start this game you can't stop.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I was good. little let down on some of the story line and plot. Would like to see what is thought of next with the character role going forward in the Avengers series.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This trilogy was by far the best series of books that I have ever read.  The only thing  I didn't like was the end of the last book. I didn't like that at all.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I've only bought one Joe CD prior to this one but I've always enjoyed his music on the radio.  I am so happy I got this one because he represented on this album.  The whole album is pretty good.  Glad I picked it up!!!
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old son who is very much into both Minecraft and Legos.  We have the Original Minecraft Lego set we bough last year and that one was such a hit we had to get the two new ones.  He loved putting this together and has a blast &#34;playing&#34; with it.  I would recommend this to any Minecraft game lover!!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Dont even try and put your finger on Mr. Clark's style, it's out there everywhere. A little Hendrix, Satriani, Vaughn all rolled up in a nice package...easy listening to some nice finger work.  Enjoyed.  Will buy more...and hope he comes to H-town?
006202406X|5.0|When I first bought Allegiant on the evening it was released, there were already some low-star reviews. But I didn't read the reviews until after I finished the book, because I knew that they were only low because the book didn't end the way the reviewers wanted.<br /><br />And, after finishing it, I can still say that all of these bad reviews frustrate and disappoint me to no end.<br /><br />Veronica is such a talented author - she showcased her amazing ability to develop characters in each book, and throughout the series.Tris, Tobias, Christina, Uriah, Zeke - all these characters were so developed, so real, I can't help but love the book (and give it a high rating). I fell in love with them over and over again. Veronica showcased her awesome talent for world-building. And her writing always surprised me - I laughed, I cried, I related, And I was mesmerized. She accomplished everything I would hope to accomplish as a writer.<br /><br />A low review would be an insult to such an amazing book, and amazing author.<br /><br />The ending, however frustrating it might've been, does not make me love the book less. As a reader I guess happy endings are cool...but I honestly wasn't expecting a happy ending in this series (that, I think, would've been unrealistic). Besides, as a reader, I learned that its not the authors job to meet my expectations all the time, especially if I ever want them to exceed my expectations.<br /><br />So, I hoped that Veronica would give me a realistic ending that did the book justice. And I think she did. Veronica took risks with this book. And those risks made it an entertaining, realistic and relatable read (for me at least). And, I'd be a pretty shallow reader if I gave a low review because I thought the ending was too emotional.<br /><br />I'm NOT going to give this book a low review: This series had so much potential, and Veronica met that potential. This book was real to me and I can only dream to one day match Veronica Roth's talent as awriter.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This show has potential but I fear they are writing themselves out of a series rather quickly from the way this series ends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad it's finally on kindle fire! It's a good game that is so addictive!! I give it five stars all the way
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|You have to get this app!!!!!It is so awesome!!!!!!!It is perfect for people who like dinosaurs.If you loved Jurassic park you will love Jurassic park builder!!!!!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved this book<br />Hats off to Kathleen Grissom for writing this amazing novel.<br />I fell in love with the characters and did not want this book to end.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I hate to admit it, but I really enjoy playing Candy Crush Saga. I fought against it for the longest time,, because the last thing I needed was another game to play, but now I am hooked.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I'm addicted to this game for many reasons. I like the mix up of puzzles and hidden pictures. I like that the illustrations are nice and clear. One of the things this game does better than most hidden picture games is that the objects move each time you play a scene. Never the same exact game twice.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />Honestly the premise was strange but it gave a twist, I didn't like how the personalities were very indistinguishable when going from chapter to chapter, but you don't kill a main character without it uniting the people. Tris dies for NO REASON! She is branded a rebel and its all deemed an accident. So Chicago is opened and people go in and out, they start a society... SO WHAT you still have an entire country that is a mess, with a government that still has the memory and death serum. So they can decide to use it at any time? Nothing gets wrapped up and you now have a broken man who lost the love of his life? Oh but you have his mom who just gave up when her son asked her to? Really? Just makes no sense as to why the author did this unless she just really wanted to end the series without having a chance to open it back up.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Great songs,nostalgia. Women's rights are set back a century but other than that fun and cool to see John Travolta this young!
0345404475|5.0|This is probably the best sci fi book of the 20th century.<br />the story is very deep and you'll find yourself asking a lot of question about who we really are.
B00BXDOSXS|3.0|I try using this product but however it was not working good. if any one have used this product in the past can you let me know how i can watch movies and TV show with this product. I have a kindle Fire HD
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I could barely put down book one and two,  but after the first couple chapters I didn't even want to pick this one up.  It was monotonous and repetitive with the same plot being recycled again and again. I could barely muster up any concern over who died and why. And btw,  I HATED the ending. I'm with one of the other reviewers opinion and I'm going to pretend I never read this one so that Tris and Tobias get the HEA they deserved.
0385344228|4.0|I thought this  novel was great if only for the ending.  It follows the suspicions raised about the death of a young boy who was found in the woods near a public path.  Jacob, a school-mate of the murdered boy, is questioned about his relationship to the boy and evidence that he might be the perpetrator of the act.  Or was it the man who lived in the trailer and aroused suspicion?  Who dunnit?<br /><br />I purchased this book from Amazon.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This is an excellent reading especially for the business school students. The business school students are taught to build a detailed and presumably &#34;fail-proof&#34; business models before start the business. However, this book introduce the flexibility into the business model with the spirit of a scientist. The one of central themes of the book is &#34;fail early and often, the success will come faster&#34; The startup entity is designed to learn from the failures instead of trying to be fail-proof. It's an easy read, but with impactful insights.
B008ROG6E0|5.0|Fun to watch this again. Funny to think this was cutting edge at the time! Obviously shot at the mall. Still really entertaining though, give it a try. You can see where a lot of newer movies have taken their story lines from the plot of Logan's Run.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome!!! If you like minions you will love this game!!!! !  Me and my brother both have it and love it!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is fun n very interesting it keeps me busy I enjoy hidden object games n this is one of my favorite!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly continues to do a great job in portraying a law enforcement professional with a true calling and 'heart' for the job.  Bosch embodies the drive and determination of thousands of homicide detectives across America.<br />Flawed but fearless at finding the truth, Bosch is a likable protagonist who you can't help but admire.
B00DNDR29I|4.0|I chose this rating because I didn't like the interruptions by the &#34;disc jockey&#34;, etc.  I saw Janelle on TV and loved her performance and style.  I enjoy Janelle Monae but would like less of the duets and interval talk.  She's so energetic and I like R&B.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I fell in love with this game when I ran upon it thru my kindle! The best free game out there I can't wait to play everyday!!!
B0035HKWLW|4.0|If you are a die hard Jim Carey old school fan when all he did was make faces you'll love this. I'm more of a Mr. Popper Jim Carey fan. Cameron Diaz is adorable and carries the whole movie.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Seriously, I like internal rebellions and all but it was constant and became very repetitive. The last ten chapters drag so much that I stop feeling emotionally invested. Honestly, it's a fizzling  ending and a bit disappointing
B001GSV3EC|3.0|Upon closer examination of the Wikipedia discography, only the DVD attained platinum status not this CD. That oversight  is mine to bear, yet again I have more distrust in the customer rating system. At best, half of this music is worth listening to.  Another recent Jeff Beck purchase titled, &#34;Wired,&#34; Tracks 2,3,5 and 8 are enjoyable, enough said for that. Much of what I really consider great Rock music can be found amongst the best 500 Rock and Roll albums of all time so my likes and dislikes don't come down to just my opinion. Any further purchases will involve information outside the realm of this forum!  Many excellent Rock albums were released when &#34;Wired,&#34; was in 1976, they redeemed my day today.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I preordered Allegiant so I would have it on my kindle the morning of October 22. Before I started it that day, I read so many bad reviews for it. I was anxious to see how the book really is. Let me tell you: don't believe the bad reviews. Allegiant was amazing; by far the best book in the trilogy. I have been anxiously awaiting this book since June, and I was not disappointed. This is the only Divergent book I have given a five star rating. Much better than Insurgent! Allegiant hooked from the very first page. I could not put it down. Be ready for some expected tears, though! This book was nothing like I expected it to be. Well done, Veronica Roth. Allegiant was perfect.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although I found the end of the book depressing, I thought that the book was written wonderfully. I didn't find it boring, and I was really sad when it was over. This is one of the only books that has actually made me cry.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved the ending but I have to say this was the best book I've read in awhile a !!!
006202406X|5.0|Loved it! Don't be put off by spoilers about the ending. Read it and you'll understand why it ended the way it did. Amazing ending.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's an okay game for 99 I wouldn't buy my self but I play it.  You should look at other games of the same gener much better out there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing books can't wait to see all the three movies that are as amazing as the books !!! Books are easy to read. Everyone should read them
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy this game but some of the levels are too frustrating  like level 140. Also you say you are giving away the helpers and altho I have tried many many times have never gotten them.. But on the whole I really do like the game
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|JPB is an excellent game if you like sim style games. I myself am very addicted to this game and think the creators really out did themselves on this one. Good job!:)
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This was a short story but was a quick read and was a good story.  The people were fun and interesting and I liked it alot.
B008JFUO72|5.0|omg,  i can't say enough about this movie. i feel that this is the best of the three movies. the action is spectacular and pepper really kicks butt. i'm sad to see this series over personally because i used to be a big comic book fan. all you people out their in movie land<br />buy this movie, you won't regret it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed how the author had her characters in the book express their thoughts & feelings. She did a good job of intertwining the characters & having an outcome that was plausible.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Can't wait to get back on the game as soon as possible. At work I take the kindle so I can get on my breaks. The only thing is it takes time to build up enough money to buy ground.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love this CD.  Whitney's vocals are still good when she made this album and she changes up some of the songs and they sound great!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I am going to start this review on my soapbox, addressing those reviewers who felt it was necessary to give the ending to the book in their review.  People who read reviews are looking to see whether the book interests them, not what the major plot twists and conclusions are before they even read the first page. I, along with many others, would love to kidney punch those who felt that it was necessary to reveal the ending to a very popular trilogy in their Amazon review! You can write a thoughtful review without giving away the plot.<br /><br />Now, is this book as amazing as the first two? That is a matter of personal opinion. The author set up a major cliffhanger at the end of Insurgent, and I think that many people had an image in their mind of where the story would go in Allegiant. I, myself, am guilty of that. It is part of the joy of reading! Half of the fun in the story is the freedom to imagine what will happen next to our beloved characters. The world given to readers in Allegiant is diametrically opposite from what we were given in the first two books. The story has a dual point-of-view, featuring Tris and Tobias, which I did find to be a bit confusing at times, but interesting nonetheless. If readers were not interested in Tobias's point-of-view, then the author would not have felt compelled to release short stories in his point-of-view while we awaited the release of Allegiant.<br /><br />The book picks up right where Insurgent left off plot-wise. The similarities to the first two books ends there, however. Roth definitely chose to make this book far more technical and imaginative in ways that her readers are not used to. I found myself to be enraptured in the first two books, but not so much in this one. The story just became a little too twisted, confusing and just a tad dull at times. The people criticizing Roth’s diction and writing style are absolutely crazy, though. Her writing is intelligent and poised. There are times that the book becomes a little too technical, but it usually manages to overcome.<br /><br />There is honestly only one word to summarize this book compared to its predecessors, and that is ‘different’. Forget everything you read in the first two books, the world you dreamed up in your mind while reading, and prepare to enter a whole new society with its’ own customs and actions.<br /><br />To those angry about the ending, you have to be kidding me? I just cannot see giving a book a one star review because you don’t like that the ending was not all rainbows and unicorns. I get the mindset that “we don’t read book for real life sadness.” However, if that were entirely true in literature then I am fairly certain that half of the American classics would fall into this category and be total failures. Did these people find The Great Gatsby to have a happy ending? The Hunger Games? If you want a book with the ending tied up in to a neat little pretty bow, then may I recommend Dr. Seuss? Of course we fall in love with characters in these stories, but that does not mean that the author has to give every single character a ‘happily ever after’ like in fairy tales.<br /><br />In summation, if you liked the first two books in the series then you should absolutely read Allegiant. If anything, just to have closure to the series. Just do not go in to this book with the belief that it is going to follow the same patterns of the first two. Just remember, a book series without differentiations and drama is generally not worth reading and is quite boring.  I will continue to recommend this series to friends and family alike.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|My stupid kindle doesn't want this game to load since it keeps reloading. This game is still pretty cool. One of the best games I ever played.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun and very addicting. It took me a while to be able to download though. I love the little characters.
B004LUS390|1.0|I am pretty sure that this was offered as faotd a while back. I see a replace button instead of a purchase button.<br />I saw this on the full site : You purchased this item on November 18, 2011.<br /><br />I guess this means that we can now expect more repeat FAOTD.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This group is a great band.  Unknown because they hail from the Netherlands.  Lead singer is a female with strong voice and easy to listen too.  Great riffs and the tracks blend well to tell the story which is based on a graphic novel.  Any rocker should have this in their collection.  The track Faster hooks you from the first note.  By the end you are screaming, I can't live in a fairy tale of lies.  Iron is also a grab you by the throat rocker.  Sounds like a bit of Iron Maiden influence in this one.  Do buy you won't be disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Kinda boring to play,usually watch TV while playing.  I don't like in app purchases so is limited for me.  Would not recommend for advanced players.

0307277887|4.0|I waited until all 8 seasons of Dexter had finished their run before reading the book that the series was based on. I was a little surprised that this book was so short, so I have to give kudos to the show's writers who were able to create 8 seasons' worth of storylines with the characters! The characters in the book follow closely with the TV version, except in the book, LaGuerta is more of a bad-ass than she was in the TV series. Interesting. I liked the &#34;narrative&#34; in the book that was also used in the TV series; in the book we get a little more insight into Dexter's understanding of his own emotional limitations.  I would have given the book 5 stars, except that I thought it was a little short and needed more story-line. Perhaps the other books will fill that in? I may give those a try.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome!  Not sure why it took so long to be available on Kindle, but glad it is now!!
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|If you are not afraid to admit your own naiveté about Washington, politics, and power, don't miss this.  The subject matter is different but it ranks up there with Dexter and Breaking Bad for quality.
B00G2ILKJ4|5.0|Produced 2004 after his death in Oct 2003 by those who obviously loved him & his music. Ten years later and I just discovered him after a front page article in LA Times on the anniversary of his death. They pictured him performing his nominated song in '98 @ the Oscars & I will never see Good Will Hunting the same again. He WAS the Good Will Hunting of Music....

B0035HKWLW|3.0|An interesting movie for a &#34;bubble-gum&#34; movie night.  This movie was funny, with Jim Carrey in an early comedic role.  Interesting visual effects, good guys, bad guys and the good guy gets the girl.  Good for a relaxing evening of entertainment, sprinkled with a few laughs.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|this book kept my interest all the way to the end. since I did not see the movie I didn't know much about the plot.<br />really liked the main character, very believeable. I enjoyed how the writer revealed the past bit by bit. the mother in this story was inspiring.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very well written; surprising and unique approach. I will definitely see the movie when it comes out. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the holocaust & how people were able to survive it.
B008G3N71W|5.0|This novel is amazing! Forget Fifty Shades or any other erotic novel out there which is repetitive and not worth reading after the first sex scene.<br /><br />This writer knows how to add spice and keep it going. The main character Greta May, a would be actress discovers a love of sex and debauchery which takes her into another world. The characters are all individuals but together paint a decorative and lurid scene.<br /><br />There is plenty of sex in this book and it is not for the faint-hearted but it is not cheap; the experiences of Greta May are described in great detail, yet it never feels dull or repeated.<br /><br />Greta May comes across as vulnerable but she discovers a strength about herself which grabs the reader's empathy as we follow her story to its conclusion.
B005LAIH4A|2.0|My son adores this movie for the characters, colors, and animation. I'll admit the Once-ler is pretty handsome in his green suit. However, I do not approve of this movie's message whatsoever. If you're an environmentalist, this movie is definitely for you. However, if you're a capitalist (or call yourself an American patriot), you will sneer, and probably find this movie repulsive. Or if you don't look too deep into the movie's message and just enjoy the story, have at it--it's a fun musical-type movie. But these people care more about trees than they do about humans. And it shows. Hollywood activism at its finest.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The writers for this show are awesome! The plot keeps bringing me back. Looking forward to Alicia getting back with the Peter, if that is the case.

B002XTBEDI|4.0|I bought this because I own a copy of the original mini-series &#34;Cranford&#34; and although I like the first one better, this completes the series and is very good.  If you enjoyed &#34;Cranford&#34;, than you will also enjoy &#34;Return to Cranford&#34;.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Went to see this tour and it was impressive. Pounding beats, glam rock riffs, love it... little bit over orchestral if that can be a thing
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've read most of this guy's stuff and with the exception of the last two books in the Dark Tower series, enjoyed them. I was a bit surprised to see that he had decided to write a follow-up to The Shining; it's one of his best and scariest books, but a sequel might diminish the story.  I must say it didn't in this case. Perhaps it's the time between the novels or the pains King went through to make sure he kept up with the original story, but this was a nice way to tie up Dan Torrance's tale. I didn't even mind the introduction of a new type of monster.
006202406X|1.0|I finished the book about two hours ago, and I have to say that I was HUGELY disappointed. I was so fond of the first two books and I've been waiting for the third one to come out for a while. And now that I've finished the book, I'm beginning to wish I never even started. Here's why. (this next paragraph has spoilers)<br /><br />First of all, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING IN KILLING THE MAIN CHARACTER? Tris has been a huge deal for the past two books and in the third book, when we were finally getting to see how Tris' and Tobias' relationship was going to turn out, She died!!! People have been waiting to see how the happy ending of the Divergent series was going to turn out for a long time now, and to do this to the loyal readers by ruining everything in the last chapters of the third book is just cruel. Especially when Tris has lost so many loved ones and has been through so much. For Tris to lose her life over her brother's to a new character is insane and poorly thought out, and I had absolutely no idea at all because the book did not give me any type of warning. I have to say that Veronica Roth completely betrayed her fans in making this decision.<br /><br />Next, the book was simply not plotted very well. For one, I had to frequently go back to the beginning of the chapters to see who was narrating because both point of views were so alike. Also, I felt as if the book was so repetitive. The same emotions and descriptions were being used over and over again, and I was starting to get bored. During Divergent and Insurgent, sure there were small kinks, but I still had an understanding of the book and the different issues had me on the edge of my seat throughout both books. But this last book seemed to drone on and on with many meaningless events that only made the book worse.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed with what Roth did in the book. She lost a lot of dedicated fans because of her decisions and I have to say that I'm one of them. I don't think that Iwill be recommending this series to anyone anymore, and I hope that the movies don't end up like the books.<br /><br />My advice is to stop at the end of insurgent and create your own ending while you still can. I wish I had.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it.I'm so glad that I can play it on my kindle now.It is a great game.Everyone is playing it.I work at a nursing home and all the workers talk about playing it so I started playing it.Thank you.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Love this album, the track Madness is fine indeed. Think this is less orchestral but overall better than previous albums. only thing bad was it didn't come with a free digital download which I wanted.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The Signature of All Things is an engrossing, entertaining, and informative historical novel. It is exquisitely written and meticulously researched.  I highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Excellent option to stream content from different devices, particularly from PCs. I wish there were more apps to work with.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|As many people have stated, I was also really excited for this book, but in the end i was really disappointed in the overall book. I should have stopped reading after Insurgent just like one of the reviewers had said.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|I like this game, its fun to play and challenging and I would recommend it for the occasional play player
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app. You can use this alarm for lots of things. Its loud and<br />And easy to use.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|When I bought this CD. it was for only one song. When I listened to the entire CD, I realized that I liked every single song.  This is my go to CD when I am in or want to be in a happy mood.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie, my 3 year old loves it. It's really cute and not scary.  I recommend it for everyone. Enjoy!
B000FVQYYK|4.0|This is good band, I saw them live and they were spectacular. But they are not very original. Some tracks borrow heavily from Queen and other 80s bands... this is not a bad thing, if Queen are no longer around and I love Queen it's good to have a quality replacement.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Entertaining and worth the read....excellent value. I find myself still curious about a lot of things and will look for the next in the series.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br /><br />OK, we all know why the ending sucked.  The main character died.  I don't see a real reason for her death either.  First of all, all these people in Four's life who he thinks are dead at various times in the series (Mother, Father, first instructor) turn out to be alive, and then they go and kill off Tris?  Ridiculous. Maybe we could find out she's not really dead either?  The epilogue was boring--so he went down a zip line with her ashes--so what?  Now the only saving grace here is to do what other authors have done and write (and sell) an alternate ending.  People are upset.  Fix it.<br /><br />I hear another author has come out and said Roth doesn't owe us anything.  Well, that's true, although she may possibly owe me my money back for the Kindle version of this piece of garbage.  But the reverse is also true:  I don't owe her anything, and I will not be trusting her again with my money, my time, and, most especially, my imagination.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This precurser to The Lord of the Rings is a wonderful lead into the much deeper work. It gives background into the former. Although it is not as well developed as the later work-it is truly wonderful and not to be dismissed as inferior.
B004X80QNG|2.0|Why use this when can use google calendar. Thought it would be useful but was just another app doing the same thing as already had.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|and will watch it again and again.  Both video and audio qualities are excellent!  Quick and good services and will order from them again.
B001O1O71C|3.0|Very sad novel.  A horrible tragedy taken to a very personal level.  And with an eight year old boy.  Gives a different perspective on the Holocost.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. I have heard many people talk about playing this game but until now, it was not available on Kindle. I was happy to finally play it. The only problem is that now I am totally addicted to this darn game! I close  my eyes at night and see little colorful candies. My only complaint is how the lives are set up. There just aren't enough in my opinion. I have no problem making in app purchases, but I don't feel that it's worth the 99 cents for 5 lives. It is used up too fast. I just feel that if I pay for an app I should get a little more playtime for my money. Other than that, it's a great game.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I heard bad things but this is a visual spectacular and very easy to watch. Kids love it. Pleasing on the eye especially the three lead woman (and probably Franco for the woman)... rewatchable and spic
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|This movie is average at best. Nothing like the first Die Hard. In my opinion it's the worst one made. It was pretty much non-stop action with a terrible plot. The action sequences weren't very good and there never was that on the edge of your seat intensity like was shown throughout the entire first movie.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I loved this season.  It continued to leave me on the edge of my seat.  I'm sad that this is the next to last season.
B00AC8ZIXO|3.0|This was a good premise for a video movie, but the acter were not so good at acting. I would recommend to player of the game.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Who knows why, its just hairdressing Sim but my 2yr and 6yr old spends ages playing at hairdressers with this app
0345803507|4.0|Loved it...a great way to finish the Trilogy. The ending was a good closure. One of the best book series I have ever read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cant put it down its fun and addictive its definitely a must have. started playing six days ago and cant stop
B0071XO8RA|2.0|The first chapter was free, and as a stand-alone short SF story, it was one of the best I've ever read. It'll stay with me like &#34;neon, krypton, ammoniated FitzJohn&#34; did. &#34;I'm afraid we've ruined this tabletop.&#34; That good.<br /><br />So I bought the book. How could I not?<br /><br />The second chapter was so painfully boring I couldn't even get through it. So much for high expectations.
0446343129|5.0|Great read didn't know some of this very in-lighting need to read let's you know some of what's in the food we eat
0345803493|5.0|Great read... after finishing the first book, couldn't wait to start the second. One of the most intense books ever
B007SGM084|5.0|This was the best book. Very erotic it had it love points, hate and very moody. I would recommend this book to 18 and up
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always loved Stephen King and this story is n exception. If only things could have been different that day. What would things be like now.
039916409X|5.0|The Margaret Lynch's process into Wealth is the most holistic approach to this issue of financial freedom, getting deep in the core of human psyche to remove blocks smoothly and fermly, making us feel a new space inwardly where everything seems possible, an open door to our creation power.<br />Greatfully,<br />Indira De Bie
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|We adore this movie. So much fun for the whole family! Saw it twice at the movie theater and then waited...and waited...and waited...for it to come out on DVD. So glad it's finally here for us to enjoy over and over again!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Thank you thank you thank you!! There's not alot of good calculator apps out there and everytime i cant find the calculator, I can just look on my kindle! :D Its simple really, im actually using it for my homework right now<br />^-^ it is really nice to have!!
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Wow, glad she decided to try country!  She definitely has the voice for country and song selection was great....can't wait to hear more from her....
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Great App for adults and kids alike. Everyone in my family likes it. It really helps build your awareness and memory recall skills. It keeps the mind active which is very important.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time, great!!!!! Really nice show to enjoy at home
B008Y76A5A|5.0|This movie is great. If you are in a silly mood, if you want to laugh. This is a fun movie.<br />Justin is hilarious.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had asked when candy crush was coming to kindle and now it has. I am so happy my kindle is perfect now! Thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cute and fun! My daughter loves playing it. And the Halloween update is great!! It's so colorful and bright and the minions are my daughter's favorite. She walks around the house saying bee-doh bee-doh bee-doh.
006202406X|1.0|I have a lot of criticisms about Allegiant: needlessly over-complicated plot; missed opportunities to develop minor characters into something other than one-dimensional protagonists/antagonists; Tobias' POV, which sounds exactly like Tris; the way each death is crafted to happen in the most tragic of circumstances turning it into boring, predictable tragedy porn; and lets not forget that super vague chapter that kinda-sorta implies Tris and Tobias had sex and Tris got over a fear so intense it appears in her fear landscape with a single, murmured reassurance.<br /><br />All that was bad enough, but still, what ruined the book for me was Evelyn's reconciliation with Tobias. I could believe that Evelyn loves her son if Roth had taken the time and care to properly develop the storyline, but she didn't. She went from Evelyn being a cold, calculating, power-hungry manipulator who was Marcus' equal in Insurgent, to a woman so desperate for her sons love she would throw away everything to secure it in Allegiant. That is unbelievable enough on it's own, but what bothers me even more is Tobias.<br /><br />The fact that he goes from thinking the only way he might be able to trust his mother is to give her the memory serum to practically weeping with joy at their reconciliation within the space of a few hundred words simply because she \\"choose\\" him is utterly unbelievable. This is the same woman who, mere weeks before, manipulated him into joining her fight with the factions only to turn around and betray him as soon as she got what she wanted. Anyone would be rightfully distrustful of her no matter how sincere she appears in the moment, but especially a son who was:<br /><br />1.) Abandoned by her as a child, and let him think her dead for YEARS.<br /><br />2.) Betrayed by her when she left him at the mercy of a man she knew to be abusive for YEARS.<br /><br />3.) Used by her to enlist Dauntless into her war against the factions under false pretenses.<br /><br />4.) Betrayedby her again when, after the fight at Erudite, she turned on Dauntless and took control of the city, violently  imposing her vision of society on it.<br /><br />That's to say nothing of the fact that she was, and continues to be, openly hostile to Tris, the person Tobias considers his \\"family\\", and the fact that she was so desperate to control him that she sent armed guards to stop their flight from the city, which ultimately led to Tori's death.<br /><br />Would you trust a person who did even one of those things? I wouldn't. I don't think most people in their right mind would. But none of that matters to Roth. I realize life isn't all puppies and rainbows, but at some point it becomes impossible to suspend disbelief because Roth's writing has left the realm of realism, and is so far into the absurd. Evelyn, for me, was the final nail in the coffin.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|awesome books wish there was more but oh well follow me on instagram @ayo_bryannn so hope you guys enjoy it
B003V4AK8E|3.0|So I bought this controller about a couple of months ago a Best Buy. THE EXACT SAME CONTROLLER!!! I thought it was amazing at first because the format of it was like a 360. I also thought the quality of the controller was fantastic and it was! But then after 4 months into it, the rubber on the analog sticks started tearing. It was not a major problem on performance though. Next thing that happened was that the charging wire that came with it stopped charging my controller and i had to charge with another wire. After that the R3 button broke. I couldnt press it anymore because the small stick within the controller that pushes the R3 button broke therefore I could use it anymore. Overall the controller was okay for people who dont play that much but if you play games a lot...this is not recommended for you as to which it is not reliable therefore look somewhere else.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game gets you into a competitive mood as when you first learn the&nbsp;controls and with each failure you just can't stop yourself lol.  Good game to get lost in. Free version semi-limited but doesn't detour from the fun.
B00873GRU4|3.0|ok, so I'm a fan of the genre. There are parts of this book that are captivating, edge of the seat exciting. But I never got the cleaning. I actually didn't buy it. I didn't understand why people cleaned. I didn't understand why everyone always cleans.<br /><br />The best science fiction takes the potentially possible and tells us something about ourselves. I think, and I hate to say it, this book falls down here. I'm not sure that human behaviour in an extremely constrained environment is accurately explored. Nor could I sense any kind of analogy for the set up. There is no parable. And here I think Hugh Howey missed an opportunity.<br /><br />But the book is a delight in many ways. The realisation of characters is brilliant, not one is simplistic or clichéd and I became seriously invested in all the main protagonists.<br /><br />Also, Hugh Howey is showing signs of becoming a serious story teller. I was gripped by the book, Hugh masterfully stretching the tension and drama for a long as is tolerable.<br /><br />I guess my 3 stars is a little harsh, but I feel I'm giving this rating relative to Hugh's potential, rather than other current science fiction novels
0345511468|5.0|While the photos are amazing there is so much more to this book!The sketches and commentary really show the process and struggle of making this epic movie. The behind the scenes photos really give dimension to the scope of what was accomplished. This book you will pick up and look through again and again!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like how I can connect with my Facebook friends and ask them for help this is my favorite app I play it every day after school
B00G32OER4|5.0|i am a huge horror movie fan and tend to have a hard time finding flicks that can acutually spook me and that i can enjoy,this was that film.awesome cinematogrraphy ,and the story was pretty well written and they tied it together pretty well.sent tingles down my spine .i loved that they were able to scare with the story and no real gore like most movies today
3453268725|1.0|I bought this book the same time I purchased Dr, Sleep.  For some dumb reason it was shipped from England and it was in German!  It would of cost me more to send it back than what I paid for it.  Not happy.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|An excellent look into Amazon and it's founder, Jeff Bezos, detailing how the company got its wings, rose, fell, rose again and refuses to bow down to anyone.
1452110581|5.0|especially if you have cats. You will feel they wrote it about them! ;))<br />I should have bought a couple of units more to give away to some of my cat lovers' friends.
0143122010|5.0|With a half a thousand pages of evidence via graphs, tables, figures, and fascinating accounts, Pinker demonstrates conclusively that humanitarianism and its paraphernalia have made the world much more peaceful and less violent. Then he spent another 300 pages to discuss human nature and to describe clearly the underlying mechanism behind all these achievements, without any romanticization or over-simplification. Myriad subjects are covered, including history, statistics, game theory, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, evolutionary theory, genetics, politics and a bit of philosophy to boot. It is unashamedly long and encompassing. Thoroughly informative and enlightening. Fiver stars.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read them in order.  The three are actually one book.  I swept through them in record time.  Fascinating.<br />I will read them again.  Maybe tomorrow...
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Awesome product...very easy to use.  Does a great job of cleanjng up apps...recovers a lot of memory space.  Love it!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I liked the game. but after a few minutes of playing my kindle would freeze then shut down. Then it would not start up again for awhile - a long while. This only happened when I played Minlon Rush. I have deleted it from my device. Soooooo sad!  I really give it NO stars.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I'm really happy with this car charger. Others I tried did not work with my iPhone but this one always does. Also, it fits in my car snugly but doesn't pull the socket out like the AT&T charger did.
1405911662|5.0|a very good book. a woman finds unexpectedly, a diary. oh the consequences of that. book is well written, albeit a little long as far as some details. but read it and see the results to the community. recommend it strongly. sak66
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely.  The music was delightful; the story - refreshing.  I am looking forward to seeing it at the Forrest next month.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You can't usually say that about apps so I like this for that reason. I need to have a calculator at hand all the time so this is convenient.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|It states that it works with Brother printers, but when I downloaded it, nothing.  I couldn't get it to connect, so I emailed the creators, they told me it wasn't compatible with my printer.  Well it's a Brother printer and the app states it works with Brothers....
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This was a really good read. Rather tragic that such a young, inexperienced kid lost his life but in the last couple years of his life it seems he learned what was really important to him. He enjoyed some great experiences with all the new people he met along the way in his travels.<br />I also enjoyed Jon Krakauer's book &#34;Into Thin Air.&#34; I will keep both of these in my library to go back and enjoy again.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Good movie.....loved the book and liked the movie. Rented it at just the right time so I watched it myself the first night and my husband watched it with me the second night.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Now if only the movie studios can get their act together.<br />The extra features are different based on who you buy the film from.<br />No extended or deleted scenes, etc.<br />Don't want to buy the same movie 3 or more times just to get all the features that are being advertised.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I got it just so that I would have a cover for my Kindle.  It works great, soft feel and lightweight.  But I would like something with a better handle on it to read in bed.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a great game. I am less than thrilled that you either have to connect it to Facebook (which I won't do because I don't want a bunch of strangers requesting me for lives/tickets nor do I wish to gum up my feed with game updates) OR you have to PAY to continue playing unless you feel like waiting TWENTY-FOUR HOURS between winning the unlock levels. Sorry but that's a little extreme. If you're going to offer an option to play unlinked don't make the way to advance so drawn out. It only took me 2 days to get thru the first part and now I am beinv made to wait and wait and wait to get thru unless I feed their money machine? Screw off...
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My son is crazy about Harry Potter.  He's read the series twice and now he's able to watch the movies.....multiple times and whenever he wants .  Great gift!
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|The movie was incredible and the music is incredible as well. It really captures the tone so well. You really can't go wrong with this soundtrack.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is great on the Kindle, a perfect screen to see everything.  It's easy to use and see everyone's posts.
0316074314|3.0|Reader, beware.  You have to be the right kind of person to enjoy this book. It's loooooong and detailed and reads like an 18th Century novel. If you do not like to read about an inspector's naval lint while investigating a gory murder, then this book is not for you.  If you have pince nez reading glasses and you read a page a day and feel fulfilled, invest your money.
B007SVPZMW|4.0|Love this game, the graphics are fun and you can change the level of challenge.  Great fun when you just want to enjoy a simpler game.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I kept debating between this and the Canon version and this one won out. I haven't been disappointed either. It has a ton of room for the camera body (Canon 6D in my case) as well as several lenses (135mm, 50mm, 24-105mm), speedlite and still has room to spare. Should have plenty of room for a couple more lenses in the future as well :).<br /><br />I've taken it out a couple times for hikes and whatnot. It works very well. I like the front straps for the shoulder and waist as well. Definitely helpful if you've got it packed down.
B004VQRCF0|4.0|I'm not the Yes completest I used to be, so the 2011 release of this DVD missed me for some reason. I saw this tour in Montreal and Lake Placid, so I had some expectations. Boy, was I surprised. So glad I bought it.<br /><br />First off, the two shows I saw of this tour, the band was amazing, but Jon was having a very difficult time. He was having a hard time staying on pitch, he looked bloated and tired. But, in this show, he is spot on, thinner, energized, and running around stage like ABWH Tour!<br /><br />Which is an interesting comparison, because this show was filmed in the same venue as the excellent ABWH video: An Evening Of Yes Music Plus. I'm sure that fact was not lost on the lads....<br /><br />As mentioned, this is not the complete show from that night. (http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/yes/1991/shoreline-amphitheatre-mountain-view-ca-13d21511.html for complete setlist). Missing are &#34;Shock To The System,&#34; &#34;And You And I,&#34; &#34;Drum Duet,&#34; &#34;Changes,&#34; and &#34;Lift Me Up.&#34; Also, there is no &#34;In The Round&#34; stage....<br /><br />However, the show has the feel of a complete show, and the performance is fantastic.<br /><br />Rabin, in particular, shines here. The man is so amazing. And he and Wakeman are just having a blast. Actually, everyone is having a blast, even Howe, who put on a bit of a pouty face at the beginning of the tour. He and Rabin have some great moments together. Wakeman's Keytar solo in the audience is a riot. White and Squire are just amazing together, and even the road crew makes an appearance during &#34;Saving My Heart.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Awaken&#34; is probably the best performance I have ever heard, especially the second part (organ/harp section). It's breathtaking.<br /><br />A great video for all you Yes-heads out there. It's so different from many other performances.... You'll be smiling all the way through.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Truly enjoyed reading this gem of a book! The pace was fast and high energy-ed the whole time!<br />Can't wait to read the next one!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's Great I Like Playing It Just Wish It Offers YOU more As The Rounds Gets Hardee..But It's Good..Great For If You Are bored .Me And My Friends Play All The Time..John Lala.
0385486804|5.0|I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book as well. It's hard to separate the movie actor from the description in the book (like always) but I am really enjoying it! Very interesting story.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Very happy, but highly disappointed.  I can't really say my real sentiments because it would give away spoilers.  While reading....Be Brave.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I like the app and yes you only get one free table and  you have  to  pay for the rest, but so what you would spend more in the arcade. Oh and I didn't have to use the keyboard for the flippers, I just touched the screen. Again it's FREE so try it out and see what you think.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A game that will exercise the brain, very enjoyable. User friendly and completely fun. I would recommend to anyone that likes puzzle games.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|THEY SHOULD SEPARATE THE OLD TESTAMENT AND REPLACE IT WITH ZEALOT AS THE INTRODUCTION TO THE NEW TESTAMENT KING JAMES VERSION.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|Fun game, many levels and two different difficulties. Its addictive, I have beat the game once and am going back to play them all on Advanced.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|Really fun. Hope they come up with harder version. I love Japanese puzzles and these are great to pass the time.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|but the second half was better.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio has gotten much better looking...he's lost the baby face and looks like a MAN now.  He actually has chemistry with Carey Mulligan, which he and Kate Winslet did not have together. As he plays Gatsby, he's anxious, energetic, sad, nervous, romantic and devoted...Robert Redford's Gatsby just seemed hyper.<br /><br />Carey Mulligan's Daisy is wimpy, weak and unlikeable.  Mia Farrow's Daisy was flighty, flaky, shallow and unlikeable.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire...is just Tobey Maguire.  When speaking to his doctor, he seems to weirdly emphasize every single word.  His characterization of Nick is not realistic.<br /><br />The first half of the movie, I did not care for the rap music, the scenes jumping around, or the way everyone spoke as quickly as they could (making the closed captioning go faster too). I also did not like all the crazy, careening, fast driving around..but maybe they were trying to make a point how careless these people were.<br /><br />The second half was more the story of Daisy and Jay...Jay's desire for Daisy's love and his love (or infatuation) for her. Daisy just seemed to go along with him...not having much gumption to make up her mind either way.  It seemed strange that she would refuse to lie about ever loving her husband (which made her husband feel triumphant), but she refused to say that she did not love him now.<br /><br />Did Jay only want Daisy because of what she represented to him? Success and that she came from a good family? Did he only love what he thought that she was, not seeing her true nature? Did he only become rich to win her back?<br /><br />It's worth watching for DiCaprio's performance, I think.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|work is worth this alarm. for daily basis I geg up and its loud even though its my first time. trying kindle alarms
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm 28, been a Bond fan all my life. Seen them all dozens of times and this one ranks as the top 3. This is a great companion to the Bond 50 Blu Ray set.<br /><br />Great movie, great price.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game its soo much fun I am on level 14 it is challenging but not enough to were you want to quit
0761172726|4.0|I understand people's complaints about not enough room per square for each person/day, but I've not found a better alternative.  I love the way you can write each person's name at the top of each month - much easier than the ones where you have to put names at the beginning of each week and read across.  I manage to fit about 2 activities in a square.  There are only 3 of us, so I use the 4th column for extra notes or reminders and the 5th column for birthdays and anniversaries.  I've bought this calendar for about 5 years now and my main issue is that I'm bored with the same images, colors and stickers.  I so wish someone else made a calendar in the same style and layout but with another theme.  Also as someone else commented, I buy it every year so starting in August is a waste for me.  The first 5 pages are totally wasted on me.  A 12 month Jan-Dec calendar would be better, less bulky and less heavy.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A very entertaining and educational book. A little over-crowded with characters, but they are all interesting and relevant.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful description of world-changing events, of which I knew very little.<br /><br />All in all, a terrific book
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I started out liking this book and enjoyed Victoria's journey for the most part.  BUt once she had that baby, and the ad naseum details of her breast feeding and sleeping, not sleeping, crying, not crying, I really just wanted to scream.  It was painful to read. The language of the flowers got lost.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Great album with a chill sound. Falls in line with the Jack Johnson classic melo sound. A must own for all you Jack Johnson lovers!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I really like everything Denzel Washington has been in and this is his best one yet! What a great actor!<br />There was not any part of the movie that dragged or that did not hold my attention. I wish I could say that for every movie I have bought. I had seen the movie in the theater and just had to buy it when it was released. There are very few movies I can say that about!
B001DE29SS|5.0|DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. An Oscar calibur movie with Oscar calibur performances especially Robert Downey Jr., must see... worth owning!
1476727651|5.0|I find some of Stephen King's books to be tiresome of late.  This is not one of those.  This is the story of Dan Torrance after The Shining.  There was no disappointment.  I was enthralled by &#34;the shining,&#34; Abra, and the evil characters in the book.  The narration was wonderful.  We walk through the years with Dan as he deals with life after the loss of his father.

B00ERIUO02|2.0|Somehow this album seems very different from her other albums. A lot of the songs have much more of a trance/hip hop sound. I'm not a fan of it. I used to love Katy's music because of the fun, flirty feel it had but this album isn't like that at all. Disappointed.

B004HYGF18|3.0|I expected to be in a closed package, but the CD was already opened, it didn't had a plastic cover
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not a fun read..  Wish I would have stopped at Insurgent.  Be prepared for a sad ending.  I thought it might happen, but hoped it wouldn't.  Left me feeling like I just watched a documentary on children with cancer.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I had already bought one of these a couple years ago, and it still work like a beautifully<br />and a friend was talking about getting a new keyboard for MMO games and so I bought her one of these for her B-Day<br />and she loves it. very easy to use and program. changed to any color. and can use it for hours on end. its amazing!!

B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The book started out slow and didn't pickup until I was about three quarters of the way through it but when it did it really did.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant was a good book, and resolved the problem that the blast book left off with, however Veronica Roth made a major mistake by killing the main character of the series. The storyline is good, but once again Veronica Roth kills off way too many people. There are hardly any of the central characters left in the book by the end of the trilogy. The  central problem was resolves, but it was unnecessary to kill the main character. It was also nice to read from Tobias' point of view, however it did get confusing at times. I enjoyed reading about the group of Allegiant that ventured outside the fence. If she had not killed the main character, I probably would have given this book a four or possibly a five.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think it is a awesome game to play.I is the best game ever.It is good for kids because it has all things a kid likes.I love this game!it's a awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wonderful Read!  Leans Left a lot but true Grisham fans (like us) are no strangers to either the Author's politics or his less than stellar opinion of the Government, especially it's Judicial and Law Enforcement branch.  The conflict and ensuing quest for revenge and retribution make for a thoroughly entertaining piece of fictious fun.  Throw in just the right amount of sex and a glorious, monstrous dose of titilating, \\"get me there NOW\\" Caribbean scenery, and you have yourself another GOLDEN Grisham Must Read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I started using this app as a way to bond with my 8 year old daughter. I thought I would only play it when we were both interested in having some funtime together...boy was I wrong. It has become a daily habit of mine even though I stick to my story when I tell other adults why I am playing.

B002SZAU1Y|5.0|This boom was amazing, i cried and laughed, it was beautiful, hope there is another book like this for me
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know the ending was not what we expected. And after reading it I admit I was mad at the author for killing the main character. but if you looked at it this was a good ending its tided all the lose ends. the ending was just not the way we expected it so please look at with not with the dyeing of the main character but the plot of the charters it deserves a 5 star. look at with an open mind and if it made since to you should have cried because I know I did. the main charater died the way she was raised.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|BAM! At 88% through the story, shit hit the fan. I thought to myself \\"self - no way! I'm sure this was a fake out - don't worry!\\"  .... but let's go back a moment.<br /><br />I put this release date on my calendar, and patiently waited. I was generally entertained as I read through Divergent and Insurgent, and enjoyed the story line and characters. I started reading this book the evening it was released and made it half way through in one sitting. I was hoping for an ending that would tie everything together in a nice tidy bundle. WRONG! I continued through the second half of the book the next day, cruising through the plot, until BAM! At 88% through the story, shit hit the fan. I thought to myself \\"self - no way! I'm sure this was a fake out - don't worry! Things will work out.\\" WRONG! The author hurt my feelings and most definitely did not meet my expectations with this book. The book quickly fizzled out, in my opinion, after... that thing happened.<br /><br />I will not read any other books by this author, because I feel she has taken advantage of an audience that was fascinated by the relationships between the characters, and their place in their Divergent world.<br /><br />4 Thumbs down. From me, and from my husband who will hear me bitch about it for another week or so.
1781162646|4.0|I enjoyed this easy read from Stephen King, actually I could not put it down once I started it.  I would recommend this as a vacation book.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Christian is as good a Batman as Ben Affleck is bad as the Daredevil.  Storyline is good and action sequences are awesome.
140006922X|5.0|Very interesting book that gives you a total different view of a personage and the era he lived in. Very well done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it!! Really recommend this book<br />Not only girls should read it but also the guys.great book to read it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a very intriguing story as most of Jodi Picoult's books are.  Her stories are fascinating and deal with complicated real life issues.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A poignant, sad, and realistic view into the lives of ordinary people and the consequence of their choices - of both commission and omission.
B0083VP2KQ|4.0|A worthy addition to the &#34;Walking With Dinosaurs&#34; series, bringing us up-to-date regarding recent discoveries.  The CGI is not quite as smooth as some that I've seen, but it's still very good.  This one's a little &#34;gorier&#34; than other installments, but not by much; most young dino-fans won't be put off by it at all.
B009LDCXNY|3.0|Gone are the days of high intensity, atmospheric Supernatural. This show was once exemplary for its adherence to actual occultism and paranormal experience, it had the dark terror and horror feeling of the Lionsgate Texas Chainsaw Masacre, and a hilarious sense of humor. Now it has more in common with &#34;Grimm&#34; (one of its more awful copycats) than it ever should. Instead of new and exciting adventures it has become almost ho hum, another predictable situation with expected solutions. Still the best show on TV which makes its loss of occult horror and adventure and unexpected and unknown situations all the harder to bare.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Finished the book yesterday and still can't believe how disappointing it was.  I can't believe the people handling the movie let this book come out before Divergent opens next year!  I was looking forward to seeing it, but there's no chance I'll be going to the theater now.  There's only about a 50/50 chance I'll even watch it when it hits DVD rentals.<br /><br />I don't need a perfect happy ending, but this was just ridiculous.  I've seen a lot of other reviewers mentioning Mockingjay, so I'll throw that in here.  I liked Mockingjay.  It was dark and characters I loved died, but the story was so smart.  We got resolutions where they were needed and some hope for our main characters at the end.  I feel like the only characters in the Divergent trilogy who were really well developed were Tris and Tobias.  I didn't care much what happened to the others.  I wanted to see this bigger world that they were in developed and have a solid ending for our couple.  The world was just dumb, Tris dies a meaningless death, and Tobias is walking around grieving 2 years later.  I'd rather have seen them die together if Roth was going to insist on killing Tris.<br /><br />I was actually enjoying the book towards the beginning, but there were so many problems with the story.  Many of those have been covered in other reviews.  It had potential, but it wasn't smart.  We're supposed to believe Natalie Prior told the government she would do whatever she wants when choosing her faction and that was just okay.  Seriously??  The group from Chicago gets to just mill about however they want in this government agency, even after Tobias' incident.  They announce the plans for the memory serum with Tris right there.  Come on!  This stuff just wouldn't happen.  Then, Tobias leaves Tris to be with her brother before he sacrifices himself.  He doesn't even think to be worried that the girl will take his place, when clearly that's the only thing she would do.  Their relationship was my favorite partof the books because it made sense, but it ends like that.  Pathetic!  Then Evelyn has some ridiculous shift that comes out of nowhere.  Horrible!<br /><br />I really do feel bad for the people involved in the movie.  I can't imagine this won't effect it.  Who wants to watch this story develop knowing it ends this poorly?  Not me.  This is one of those situations where you want the movie trailer to hit mainstream, people talk about it, you tell them they have to read the books and then see the movie with you.  Only I'll be telling people to run fast in the other direction.<br /><br />Maybe someone else can come in and write us a new 3rd book.  I'd happily forget this one!
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have it on my smart phone and kindle.  I have used it constantly.  It provides me with security so I do not have to worry if something does not belong or having someone get my info.  I also have it on my computers which I have used for the last two years.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great read especially ..after reading Gone girl.. different but good in its own way.  Although the premise is disturbing, (but do we expect anything less from from Gillian?)The  main character Libby Day is very likable and the story is a good mystery.  Highly recommended!
0061950726|3.0|It was a nice story, engaging enough, although I guess I was looking for a little more richness and depth there in the character development.  I felt that the author conveniently skipped some years in the protagonists' life that would have been revealing.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I don't even quite know what to say.  I am disappointed.  I guess without giving too much away, it was really good until the end of the book.  A bad ending for a book is a lot like a bad ending for a movie for me.  It can be a great movie with a stupid ending, and it ruins the whole movie for me.  I am sad to say that is what this book did for me!  I am just sad! BUT, I am not the Author and it's obviously the authors prerogative to take their book in whatever direction they feel necessary.  I just wish it wouldn't have ended the way it did!  I gave it two stars just because the other two were so fabulous I didn't have the heart to only give it one. :(
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|addicting game but it is a lot of fun to play. I love playing this game ...a great brain teaser.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love it! To see Candy Crush on a big screen is awesome! I enjoy playing it on my Kindle versus my computer or cell phone!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for Candy Crush to come to Kindle. I couldn't believe it when I saw it was there. I called and told all my friends that it was available so we all downloaded it. Thank you
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|With the typical Bryson insight and humor, we are whisked to the era of Prohibition and unlikely,risky air travel, and treated to the real birth of the popularity of our national pastime.<br />It's the side-roads that Mr. Bryson takes us on in the last few books that make these offerings an often unexpected delight.<br />Bravo!
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|The series rocks. With Captain Jack, Gwen and Tosh. Great spin-off of a great classic sci-fi series. Saw all but web of lies.
B004LUS390|5.0|Thank you amazon... This is best free app of the day so far  thanks a lot. This is one of the best app around for android.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Enjoyable time waster. Tons of fun to play and you are actually challenged. Like any puzzle game your mind gets a good workout. I recently got to Level 33 but could not proceed without paying. There were also levels you can't complete without paying for the boost. You guys should just charge a flat fee to play the game and just include the boost. It's never cool to find out that something is free but not really. But the game was fun overall and I do recommend it. Just beware that you're gonna have to pay. Hence my 3 star rating. I don't like those kind of surprises.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing! I hated ending this book and the emotional ending takes you on such a roller coaster of feelings. There was a time or two where I once again feared a possible YA \\"love triangle\\" crap, but that was quickly resolved. The whole world is open, nothing is what anyone ever thought it would be. Who really is the bad guy? Are they all bad guys? How can the world really be fixed and what will happen to everyone after so many revolutions, rebellions and changes in everything they thought they knew. Amazing end to a wonderful series. I applaud you, Veronica Roth. Thank you so much for such a refreshing YA dystopian trilogy. I absolutely love it, even if I cried a time or two in this one! I know people were not happy with the writing style, but I feel it went with the trilogy. At the beginning of the first book, Tris was a kid, and at the ending of this one, she was an adult. The changes in the characters, because of all that they went through, is immense and shown in the way this book is written. I am a huge reader, and this is one of hundreds of thousands of books I have read. I loved this book. I was not thrilled with the ending, it was upsetting, but I really liked her tone, the set-up and finality of it all.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|SPOILERS.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Okay, let's be honest: I sobbed. I refused to believe the ending was actually happening. Then I sobbed the way through the last 40 pages or whatever.<br /><br />Then I stayed up for about another hour thinking about it. And I decided that it had to end this way. This was the story she set out to tell. Ignoring Insurgent, which I believe was the weakest of the series, and going way back to the beginning of Divergent, we have a theme - sometimes being brave and being self-sacrificial are the same thing. It takes truly understanding your bravery in order to be self-sacrificial. So she did.<br /><br />And to me, the ending was a bit like Romeo and Juliet. It took a death (not two, thankfully) to truly get the change needed in the city and the country. The difference? Romeo and Juliet is about 25,000 words long. The Divergent trilogy is closer to 500,000 words. So I think we care more. A bit more invested in the characters.<br /><br />There are truly bits that I found confusing. There were some plot holes. (To me, I didn't understand how separating out the GD by what makes them supposedly WORSE was the best experiment out there.) But in the end, I think Veronica did a good job. I think it's worth reading. And as much as I wish Tris would have woken up again, I can respect her for choosing to end it the way she did.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have gotten so stuck on this game, I like the challenges the one thing that does frustrate me is getting my lives. I play on face book and phone<br />I can retrieve lives from phone but not on my PC. All in all I love the game way to much. ! :-)
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think this game is pretty cool u can go to the nether kill zombie and stuff just like the regular minecraft but I think that they should have another update and put really cool mods in it because the 0.6.1 update is really boring now and there's no excitement
6305265666|5.0|Drew Barrymore is great in this movie and I watch it continually.  My movie collection just keeps getting larger.<br /><br />OK you're asking for a longer comment but I have nothing else to say.  I just LOVE this movie.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|Book one was pretty interesting with good character development including some surprises. I enjoyed the majority of the book and did not want it to end. Book two was slow reading and easy to guess what was coming next. I was glad to complete book two. Right now I have know interest in reading book three.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a terrific app for little kids. There is a lot of variation, plenty of different tools and choices, and fun visuals. My 5 year old can't get enough of this game, and I enjoy making the occasional haircut, too, to make her laugh or surprise her.  I do wish there were a couple more face choices, but overall, it's a terrific app and well worth the money.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved the original kick and enjoy the new.<br />Like the more &#34;open&#34; spock too.<br /><br />This is a movie that did not forgt the old fans of Star Trek yet pleases the new fan as well.  Even my wife liked it!<br />There are many homages to the Rath Of Kan in it.. Only I got them, but so what, it made it fun for me.
B008Y212PI|4.0|These puzzles were enjoyable and often challenging. I like the option to go to the fifteen by fifteen size for an extra challenge.

B000RLFJQ2|3.0|This movie has tons of action. The acting is weak in spots and it seems overly long. De Niro's portrayal is okay.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Fortunately this mistaken identity changed Rose' s life for the better..Enjoyed this book..always like one with a pet as a character..

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When Google released this the second after their press conference announcement. I found out that this item became sold out in less than half the day. I've been watching reviews and previews of this item and it is far by if not, one of the most awesome streaming receiver for your TV. Currently Streams Hulu, Netflix, Google Play Movies/Music, and Youtube. New apps to stream soon so, keep that noted to keep an eye out for a updates on this.
0061122416|5.0|I so loved this book from the first chapter. When my mother was terminally ill and on hospice care I would read it to her at night until she fell asleep...peacefully.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|My 2 yr old grandson was not talking until I got this app.  He sits for hours on my kindle fire playing by himself repeating after the app.  This also  helps hand eye coordination.
0767919408|5.0|I purchased this book for my father who was 4 during the summer or 1927 and normally only read biographies of classic film stars but after reading the first chapter - I was hooked!  This is a well written and exciting book focusing on the events that took place in the summer of 1927 in America. While the book focuses on the two most exciting events of the summer: Lindbergh's flight to Paris and Babe Ruth's amazing season with the New York Yankees, we also hear about Ruth Snyder's murder of her husband, the bombing at a school in Michigan that is still the highest school mass murder in history, the Sacco and Vanzetti case, President Calvin Coolidge, politician Herbert Hoover, the four high-ranking bank officials that caused the Great Depression, Lou Gehrig's amazing season with the Yankees, Mabel Walker Willebrandt who was the lawyer who came up with the plan to \\"get\\" Al Capone on tax evasion, bombings of the homes of various politicians, the Jack Dempsey-Gene Tunney fight, the attempts of other pilots to fly across the Atlantic, the shutdown and retooling of Ford to bring about the Model A, the rise of the popularity of radio, sound coming to the movies, the invention of television, and so much more. The author instills a sense of excitement in each story and weaves the Lindbergh and Ruth story through the entire book which was difficult to put down. If this book does not get you excited about history - then I don't think anything will.  One of the best books I've read this year!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Without a doubt, the best written, acted and creative television show made. The cast's chemistry is completely brilliant. Addictive, dark and utterly entertaining.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|REALLY! What took so long! I love Candy Crush! I play it all the time on my mom's phone, but it has finally come to Kindle, and I'm so happy!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|&#34;Into the Darkness&#34; is one of the best Star Trek movies I have ever seen and I have seen them all.<br />The story is engaging and the actors are great.<br />I don't think anyone will be disappointed with it.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I am so hooked on this game!  I tell my kids to think about someone and see if the game can guess who it is. We played this for hours and when I was just about to give it a 5 star rating one of the questions my daughter was asked about her character was, &#34;Is she a lesbian?&#34; While we are by no means prudes we'd rather explain such things on out own time and no thave a game introduce lines we do not wish them to cross at such a young age (For this same reason they are too young to watch SouthPark for a few more years). So if the kids know about the birds and the bees, you're fine. if you are not yet ready to crush their views that the world is all disney princesses, then wait a year or two longer. So this is maybe a PG rated game.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|Great album! She really knows how to appeal to all ages!! Thank goodness for some new refreshing music that I don't have to sensor to much for my daughter.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a great read on the plane. Not difficult at all but very entertaining. I mean I got the book free, so I wasn't expecting too much, but I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the haunting account of one child's incredible life in Germany during WW 2.  It is filled with characters throughout in the true sense of the word!<br /><br />Be prepared to laugh, to cry and to wonder at the resilience and the evil of humanity!<br /><br />This is a book EVERYONE should read!  May The Book Thief's words propel each reader toward being the best person they are meant to be!<br /><br />May all inhumanity cease in our world.  May we learn from our shared histories.  And at the end of our lives may we rise from our bodies ready and accepting.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great graphics and easy to play! I would recommend this game to anyone that likes to play these kinds of card games.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Got this on my Kindle and started to read.  Stephen King is one of my fav authors and the first couple chapters are typically intriguing, spell binding and wonderfully weird!  LOVE IT!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Very good movie. Brad Pitt was excellent with many surprises. I would recommend this movie and plan to watch it again.
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|Was a good movie that was set in wonderful scenery<br />saw this prior to going to the play... can't wait

B00BCMT4RA|4.0|This was my first venture into the &#34;real&#34; blues and I have really enjoyed it. The songs on this album are different than what im used to(heavy metal) but they are well crafted, well written, and really good songs.Because of this disc I have opened my mind to a whole new world. Ive gotten other cd's from guys like stevie ray Vaughan,buddy guy, and howlin' wolf and a few others. This is one of those disc that when I put on I cant just listen to a song or two but I have to hear the whole album.I wouldn't hesitate recommending this album to someone.
1250012570|4.0|This is a great book. I couldn't put it down. The book is well written and appeals to both teens and adults.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was not pulled into this book like the first two. I really only finished because of my love for the first ones. I'm shocked-bored with the ending. It just a flop. I'm not sure it even deserves the two starts I'm giving it. I think we need a take 2 in this.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is instantly addictive.  However it'd be really helpful if it had a glossary.  I spent the first few levels trying to figure out what jellies were.  Had to Google it.  Otherwise it's great.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very powerful, yet saddening story that kept me wanting to read. One of the nest books I have ever read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad they made candy crush for the kindle!this game is so addicting i can play it all day
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I think it's one of the best shows on television. The writing is superb, as is the acting. I'd give it  6 stars if I could !
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|I waited for this case to arrive before I was available. It finally arrived but was surprised of the quality. First off it can see scratches on the inside and outside of the case. The case was put inside a plastic case but not protected by any protected plastic as commonly with others. Second the transparent plastic was not really transparent as seen in picture.  I was surprised of the low quality of the brown edges too.  When I tried to return it I didn't get a prepaid postage. When I escalated I was asked of proof. I thought its a $10 case and people won't even trust you of your words. Not a happy customer.

B002HWUU2C|5.0|This is the Deluxe version that includes the Strict Joy CD from the Swell Season and an Audio CD of a live performance in Milwaukee AND best of all in my opinion, the DVD of the same performance in Milwaukee.<br /><br />I found Strict Joy a little bit of a mixed bag of songs. Some I really liked, like Low Rising, but some of the songs leave me a little blah. But if you like the Swell Season you will enjoy the CD.<br /><br />Now the Live CD is AMAZING. Great playing, great sound mixing, and GREAT performances. They all just play together so well and they do a wide variety of songs of mostly their more well known stuff (not a negative for me). And the DVD has more between songs talking from Glen and some background/behind the scenes type stuff. The video quality is good, but not great if you watch on High Def TV. In some places the cameras struggle with the lighting, the deep blues and purples for instance can look a bit pixelated. But the performance will keep you from caring much about it. High points for me are Marketa's solo version of All the Way Down, the simplicity of I Have Loved You Wrong, and 'Once'. And Fitzcarraldo, a Frames cover song with the addition of Marketa on piano, is for me my new favorite song I've heard in a long time. The vidoe is on YT search for pR_1V1QWKYA<br /><br />A note about the seller: The set was in perfect like new condition.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|After reading the first two books in the Divergent trilogy, I was kind of on the fence. I didn't dislike the books, in fact I liked them enough to keep reading. I saw the big reveal at the end of the second booking coming from a mile away, but sometimes guessable plots are something we deal with in YA novels, and so I didn't think too much of it. I was not excited for this book, but when I was bored the other night I decided to purchase it. I was SHOCKED at how many bad reviews it had and thought it must be a fluke, so I purchased the book.... (Spoilers past here!)<br /><br />Allegiant starts off with a good feel and set-up. The old way has fallen. Tris and Four are still on the rocks. There is a looming outside world waiting for us. What will we find? Will our heroic couple make it or fall apart?  If we ignore the switch between Tris and Tobias (Which, as other reviewers said, is hard to read because you can barely tell their tones apart, and often I would skip reading WHO was narrating the chapter and find myself confused until they spoke about the other person), this is the best part of the book, in my opinion. It all goes downhill when they actually visit the outside world. The big reveal of the outside world falls short. As a reader, I was amped up and ready for SOMETHING. Instead, much like the characters, we are left with chapters and chapters of limbo. In dialogue, we even get something along the lines of &#34;We haven't really been sure of what to do with you guys and we think you haven't been sure either.&#34; That's how the book feels! Limbo. The genetic stuff seems dull, because there is little set up of it. We don't really get to feel the affects of the divide in this outside world, we're just given a glimpse and told it sucks, so we should be behind ending it. As I trudged through the pages, waiting for something exciting to happen, I realize that the reason for the POV shift is because Tris is going to die, but the story is going to continue after her death. And she does and it does. And it's all so BORING.<br /><br />All in all, I feel like this had a lot of potential, but it felt rushed and sloppy. There was action, but not enough world building for us to care about it. I was more excited about the glimpses of what was happening back in Chicago then I was about what was happening around the main characters. If you're like me and you like to finish what you started... Pick it up and read it. Just don't get your hopes up too high.death. And she does and it does.

006202406X|4.0|The Story-<br />Even though Tris revealed the secret at the end of book 2, Allegiant finds her in prison for treason. Due to her resistance to truth serum, she is able to lie and get herself and her friends of the hook. But, life in the city is almost as worse as before. The factionless have taken control, and have demolished all the factions. Now that they are out of the shadows, the factionless are ruling the people by force and declaring the video Tris released as a lie.<br /><br />Tris, Tobias, and a few close friends decide the only place left for them is outside the city walls. However, when they leave they find the world waiting for them has as many problems as the city they just left. Years of genetic manipulation has left the human population at odds with one another. \\"Purity Wars\\" were fought and millions died. Now, the genetically pure lead things, with the genetically damaged seen as second class citizens.<br /><br />As Tris and Tobias learn about the world they've escaped into, they see the injustice running rampant and join forces to help the GD (genetically damaged). Things get hairy when they learn of the Bureau's plot to wipe out all the memories of everyone left in the factionless city and reprogram them to be different people.<br /><br />My Thoughts-<br />A great ending to an action-packed trilogy. Wow, this book really tied together all the loose ends, both emotionally and physically. The story switches back and forth between Tris and Tobias' POV's. We see Tris as she learns that her genetic defects have healed, and Tobias as he is declared genetically damaged. Both struggle to relate to the new world and find their places in it. I have to admit that I often got confused about whose POV I was in. Tris and Tobias are so alike that it would catch me by surprise to find myself thinking I was in one of their heads, when in fact I was in the other.<br /><br />Though not as action packed as the previous two books, this one is full of emotional drama. I didn't miss the action as I learned about the world that was outside the city. The idea of genetic manipulation is feasible for our day and age, and reading about the results and the deluded secrets of the people left in charge was hard, because I could see it happening in real life.<br /><br />The ending is a big shocker. I wasn't ready for it, and when it happened I was in disbelief. However, Roth does a great job continuing the story so that we feel the aftermath on our characters and as you read on, the shock eases. Wow, this series has some great lessons.didn't miss the action as I learned about the world that was outside the city.

006202406X|3.0|*SPOLIERS* I love the Divergent series, the first two books were really good. I even stayed up on the release night of Allegiant to start reading it. It starts out interesting and I read it really fast. I was getting so excited for the happy ending between Tobias and Tris (because I absolutely love them as a couple). And then.... Tris dies. I literally was so upset. I was crying and could not believe VR could just end the book like that. I am disappointed. I mean who just goes and kills off the main character right at the end? NO ONE. ugh so anyway, I still have respect for the novels and all, I'm just really let down. The series could have ended on a much happier note. But for those of who don't mind getting your heart's broken, then go ahead and read it. But beware, its depressing :(
B00887490Y|2.0|My definition of a good twist: you can go back and re-watch the movie, and it all holds together with the ending in mind.<br />Such is not the case here. Two stars instead of one because there is a point, half way in that I did not see coming, and a couple of character actors I like have minor roles. But a weak story and Jessica Biel's lifeless, staring performance drag it down to the point of being almost unwatchable.

1439152799|4.0|My first Kate Morton book was her bestseller - \\"The Forgotten Garden\\".  I enjoyed that so much I wanted to read her other books.  \\"The Distant Hours\\" is very unusual and there are numerous turns and twists in this Gothic novel.  Morton tends to jump back and forth between the \\"mystery\\" of today and the history of the \\"mystery\\".  She takes her time with background and developing the characters.  I sometimes want her to move a little faster, but after the ending of her books I realize why she took such painstaking steps with her characters.<br /><br />A good read!  I am now in the process of reading her latest book, \\"The Secret Keeper\\" and it also seems to be slow on the takeup.  I am getting near the end and a lot of that mystery is now unfolding.<br /><br />Enjoy Kate Morton's writings!!

B00FQ272ZI|2.0|This movie is unique, for sure.  It's got very few words, and covers between 1 and 2 weeks of terror as a struggle for survival by a lone shipwrecked sailor gets ever-harder.  He has to transfer from his smashed up yacht to a life raft, and then the second half of the movie gets even more frightening as he keeps trying to get discovered, protect his life raft, and hydrate himself.  I wish there had been something more for me to connect to than the problem solving skills of survival by this anonymous man, played by Robert Redford.  I couldn't find personal value for me in the story, just kept wanting the crisis to end.  There were several very powerful moments, but in my opinion, they would have been better served in a story that dealt with more than just \\"I've got to survive!\\"  I feel that stories of survival are much better when there's something that changes for the better within the character, or there are other characters with whom the main character forges relationships.

When I turned around I also noticed my 3 year old dancing as well.....I guess it's a winner for all age groups :)
B007KW5NJ4|5.0|This may be the best movie I have seen in a while. I am, and have always been, a huge fan of all of Christopher Nolan's movies. As soon as I see his most recent movie, I'm always looking ahead to see what he has coming up. Memento was the first of his movies that I saw, and it blew me away. His takes on Batman have been equally brilliant (with the Dark Knight considered by many to be the best comic book movie out there) and The Prestige is one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />So what did I expect going in to Inception? Nothing short of brilliance again. I don't really want to go into what happens in the movie as it is definitely one that needs to be watched for oneself, but I will say that despite my really high expectations, it delivered way beyond what I had hoped for. The story is smart, engaging and a little bit puzzling (in a good way). The scenery/imagery is fantastic. There were several scenes in the movie where I was blown away. They were the kind of scenes that are iconic (some of which have, unfortunately, been in the trailers). Hans Zimmer also delivers a haunting, reverberating (literally) score that pairs wonderfully with Nolan's vision. Perhaps the aspect that works the best about this movie is its phenomenal ensemble cast. Every person, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Tom Hardy to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, fit perfectly into the puzzle without a piece missing or out of place.<br /><br />I realize that I haven't really explained what the movie is about and for the sake of those of you who may be on the fence about seeing it, think of it as a con/heist movie that takes place within the mind. There's action, suspense, some funny parts and some real emotional moments as well. Definitely worth seeing (several times).

If you've never seen it you will be either enjoyably fooled by the levels of the stings going on or else you will enjoy figuring out the stings before they are revealed.  Movie was a little longer and slower than I remember it from the 1970's.  My 14 year old had a hard time maintaining interest in it.  Parents should be aware that there are scenes in a house of prostitution.  The violence is not gory, but murders do occur.  Historically important movie as it teams Redford and Newman.  Newman looking his best in this movie.
B00BEIYGQG|4.0|It should be quite clear by now that Hollywood and moviegoers have this undying interest in the premise of time travel.  Generally speaking, time travel flicks are notorious for being either incredibly good or horribly bad.  Just a few of the most beloved films include Back to the Future, The Terminator, and Groundhog Day.  On the flip side, there have been quite a few films that had potential, but just brutally missed their mark.  Just a few of these easily forgettable flicks include The Butterfly Effect, Black Knight, and Land of the Lost.  You'd think a subject like establishing a coherent timeline for the benefit of telling a story would be relatively easy, but often times the writers and filmmakers overlook vital facts that completely ruin and overshadow the whole film.  In other words, attempting to make a successful time travel film can be some risky business, yet they are still attempted - quite often, in fact.  It's also a bit of a rarity to see a romantic comedy incorporated with time travel, all of which happens to be rolled together and incorporated in the new film, About Time.<br /><br />Written and directed by Richard Curtis (Love Actually, Pirate Radio), About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a young man that's told by his father (Bill Nighy) that he has the ability to time travel.  Tim quickly decides he's going to use his ability to find love - while also helping his family and friends along the way.  One night on a blind date, Tim meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and helplessly falls for her.  Using his ability, he rewrites their meeting and molds their relationship into a modern day love story.  However, over the course of his life, Tim discovers that he can't always fix every problem just because he has the power to go back in time.  Lindsay Duncan, Lydia Wilson, Tom Hollander, and Margot Robbie also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />If you watch this film and end up saying something like, \\"I don't know who any of those actors were, but they were pretty good,\\" you won't be the only one.  Lead actor Domhnall Gleeson will be nearly unrecognizable to the majority of viewers, but Harry Potter fans will surely know his face, previously playing Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & 2.  Regardless, About Time could be the gem that jump-starts Gleeson's career as he resoundingly demonstrates his ability to carry the load as a lead actor.  He's witty when he needs to be, peculiar at times, but obviously has a firm grasp on his emotionally-fueled character.  While you'd assume his best scenes and chemistry would be with fellow co-star Rachel McAdams, it's really with Bill Nighy - portraying his father.  Gleeson and Nighy easily steal the show with their father/son bond, providing several laughs - and the eventual tears.<br /><br />British and Scottish fans are more likely to recognize the faces in this film, including Bill Nighy, Lindsay Duncan, and Tom Hollander, but American fans will quickly identify Rachel McAdams - famous for her roles in romantic films, including The Notebook and The Time Traveler's Wife.  Although McAdams, who plays the main love interest, is present for the majority of the film, her character offers very little in substance.  This film is nearly and almost purely male driven, focusing on Gleeson's character, almost to the extent that her only purpose is to react to whatever Gleeson says or does in any given situation.  So, in a lot of ways, it feels like McAdams is only along for the ride.  Her chemistry with Gleeson is average, but nothing outstanding or monumental - despite the fact that they make for an odd couple.  Her character's only real contribution is to relay Richard Curtis' odd devotion and obsession with English model, Kate Moss.<br /><br />This film is a much more romantically theme-driven than it is about time travel, often focusing on the choices of the male characters in regards to his love life, family, and friends.  And, like many time travel flicks, About Time provides an interesting tale that asks the question, if you had the power of time travel, what would you go back and change?  The execution of the plot is a bit blotchy at times, but for the most part, this film is funny and enjoyable for the whole family.  At times, it looks and sounds far too much like a Hallmark card, but that's obviously the nature of Richard Curtis, who has previously written several popular romantic comedies, including Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Four Weddings and a Funeral.  And, keeping with the trend of those films, Curtis writes these characters with a tremendous amount of personality.  Their charm is addictive, and often intoxicating to the extent that you won't be able to stop yourself from embracing their cheeky ambition for happiness.<br /><br />The main underlying issue of this film comes from the pre-mentioned difficulty with writing a story revolving around the use of time travel.  At first, the rules Tim must abide by seem rather tame and harmless.  He obviously only has to contend with the proverbial \\"butterfly effect\\" where any changes that are made could have dire consequences on other people.  Of course, just when you think there's very little controversy to be had, the father steps in and adds more rules - creating time travel drama.  Obviously, it's difficult to go into detail without spoiling plot points, but the main issue is even though this film gives itself rules - it can't seem to follow them, creating several gapping plot holes that will leave many scratching their heads.  The good news is these roles aren't terrible enough to cast a shadow over the film.<br /><br />Overall, About Time is a quality picture, featuring an enjoyable cast and halfway ambitious story.  Even though this film mostly features a youthful ensemble, it will largely be a draw for an older crowd.  The plot is plausible enough that viewers won't lose their mind attempting to interpret the time travel jumps, so best rest assured that this film does focus squarely on romance, landing laughs, and jerking tears.  Domhnall Gleeson proves he's capable of being the leading man and undoubtedly thrives with a lovely supporting cast.  There may be brief moments of plot confusion, but they will quickly drift away, replaced with plenty of laughter - especially from Bill Nighy.  In the long term, whether this romantic comedy has the ability to ultimately contend with the likes of popular flicks like The Notebook or Love Actually remains to be seen.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|After what most people dubbed one of the greatest Comic movies of all time in &#34;The Dark Knight,&#34; Christopher Nolan has the challenge of coming up with an epic conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy. Apart from just the challenge of meeting high expectations, Nolan had to make a different movie than he probably initially would have planned with the untimely passing of Heath Ledger (The Joker). However, despite these obstacles, Nolan still manages to go out with a bang.<br /><br /> &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; picks up 8 years after the events of &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; and finds a Gotham almost free of crime due to the deal Batman and Commissioner Gordon make. However, both men are still haunted by what happened and the choices they made. Now, a new threat has come to Gotham in the form of Bane and the Dark Knight decides it may be time to come out of retirement.<br /><br />Nolan has brought together quite the cast, managing to fill even the smallest role with someone fitting.Tom Hardy is especially impressive and intimidating as Bane and the ensemble in general give great performance, along with several of the newcomers to the series like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, a by-the-books cop working under Commissioner Gordon, and Anne Hathaway as the mysterious Selina Kyle. The holdovers from previous movie continue their strong body of work: such as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Christian Bale.<br /><br />The movie is pretty large in scope (and running time), but it is surprisingly well paced for a movie nearing 3 hours. Probably helps in part due to the structure of the story, similar to the Avengers in that it seems to have three distinct acts to it. There's a lot going on, but as is usual with Nolan he starts by laying out all the pieces of the puzzle before the movie begins to put everything together.<br /><br />&#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; brings the trilogy full circle in terms of plot, themes and even the visuals with plenty of references or nods back to the previous movies as well as continuations of the themes. The movie brings a close to Nolan's Dark Knight story in a way only he could and really makes it feel like a truly epic three film character story arc.r nods back to the previous movies as well as continuations of the themes.

B002N7RAH4|4.0|if you liked Shaun of the Dead & End of the World you will probably like this one.  No aliens, but still strange inhabitants of an innocent looking village pitted against Simon Pegg's supercop character.  Same type of laughs as in Shaun of the Dead and End of the World.  Very gruesome in places; may disturb some adults and teens/pre-teens with the gore.  Best characterized as a comedy/horror genre.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|From start to finish...a real charmer.  Any internal conflicts end well for the main character.  What a welcome change.  A gay romance with the emphasis on &#34;romance&#34;.  Nicely acted - good cast.  Highly recommended!!!  The kind of film to own - and watch again and again!
B001Q1Y170|5.0|The songwriting is dark. The singing is haunting. The instrumentation is brilliant. There is plenty of traditional British musical influence here and this would be considered to be Folk/Rock/singer/songwriter stuff. Every song is brilliant. Some of the mixing is rough but that's okay with me.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|After bringing to life the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy around a decade ago (really?), Peter Jackson is now finishing the work he started by bringing to life J.R.R. Tolkien's original Middle Earth tale, The Hobbit, to life. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first in a planned trilogy (originally planned as only 2 movies) adapting the book, padded up a bit with extras from the Lord of the Ring appendices and other works such as The Silmarillion. What results is a more epic version of the beloved tale better incorporated into the mythos of middle-earth than the book itself.<br /><br />The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is visually and thematically in line with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book is definitely a simpler story than it's Lord of the Rings companions, but after writing, Tolkien did try to link them and Jackson is taking the next step by integrating the appendices and other source material to really make the Hobbit feel like a true precursor to the epic.<br /><br />The film, apart from the fantastic visuals, also has excellent casting. Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo, the loveable, bumbling burglar. Although, for the sake of the movie (being part of a trilogy), Bilbo does step up his game a bit. Richard Armitage also shines as Thorin, the leader of the 13 dwarves that arrive at Bilbo's doorstep looking for the 14th member of their party. Of course, as usual, the returning cast also shine (such as Ian McKellan as Gandalf, and Ian Holm as the older Bilbo).<br /><br />The main concern I had going into the movie related to the visual effects. For the previous movies, Jackson utilized lots of practical effects (extras and miniature sets). However in the Hobbit, the vast majority (if not all) of the creatures are CGI, as is most of the scenery. At parts, these effects are pretty obvious and slightly distracting, but the overall effect works.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34; is a great start to the second trilogy of middle earth movies. Peter Jackson does a great job of tying the everything together and tries his best to make it feel like a single, contained movie, but it definitely feels more like part of a whole, long movie. Just like with his previous Tolkien movies, Jackson does take some liberties with the source material in order to adapt the book smoothly for the screen, but does so with the same keen eye that made the Lord of the Rings trilogy such a wide success.iddle earth movies.

B00FWLDHSY|4.0|As a fan of such anime series as Gundam Wing, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Vision of Escaflowne, I was delighted to see this live action mecha movie starring some of my favorite TV actors (Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Charlie Day). The action scenes were great, the electric guitar-laden soundtrack is fantastic (I especially love the main theme that runs throughout the movie), and I liked the friendship/romance of Raleigh and Mako. A number of reviews called it a dumb, fun movie, which I think is way too harsh. I didn't find it dumb at all---it was pure action, adventure, full-scale battle. Loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so very very addicting. My mother who doesn't usually play games like this is on level 117.
0061733199|5.0|Really interesting read. Just the info I was looking for  in an easy to read and understand format- is there a course out there that goes along with it?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is SOO awesome and fun. I have played it on the computer via Facebook before. I LOVE the game because of the fact that you have to either make it so that all of the jelly is removed or all the ingredients in it are removed from the board. My Facebook friends play it too, one of the players being my sister. I think that I would recommend this game to anyone else who likes challenges.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I bought this as an anniversary present for my boyfriend. He absolutely loved it. He was quick to assemble all three variations in which the box contains. A lovely presentation in all. Would buy two more so we can have one assembled in all forms. :)

0385537131|5.0|The writing is crisp and clear.  There is no need to go back and reread anything and you never wonder who is speaking.<br /><br />The story grabs you right away.  And it really could have happened.<br /><br />The characters are fascinating.  You may even know some of them.<br /><br />I've never been to that part of the south but the descriptions of Clanton make it seem real.<br /><br />You can't wait to find out what happens but you don't want the book to end.<br /><br />Don't worry what the story is about - just read it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cudos. It is so easy to install and so easy to operate. Few problems here and there but it works great almost all the time.
034580404X|5.0|Truly enjoyed the Trilogy and it definitely was a must read.The stories continued to flow from one page to another and from one book to the next. I see that the movie was in the works but I feel it won't do justice to just how amazing the book's are.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|My husband has total control of the TV clicker so I am thrilled to have this series availlable on my Prime Account on my Kindle.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|After watching the first couple episodes of Breaking Bad, I was sold.  It had several stale episodes, but hindsight, it was laying the framework for what was to come.  I wouldn't recommend this show for children, however, my wife and I found this to be the best series on television.  We were quite sad when the final season was over...what to watch now on Sunday nights.
0767821769|2.0|You've got to hand it to Susan Sarandon. She was able to take the role of a valiant,dying paragon of motherhood and turn her into a thoroughly disagreeable and unlikeable character.
B00E8AVNAE|5.0|This movie is worth every dollar. It has a lot of action. I was very impressed. If you like western movies you will like this one. Not much more to say then I would recommend this to anyone.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|One o the best movies I seen. Meg Ryan is amazing! Get a box of tissues, some good wine and press play. The perfect night!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I heard about this video from a forum I belong to.  I purchased it on a whim and was very happy with it.  Very inspirational and a great movie.  Not filled with the typical violence of today's movies, but a great movie that everyone can watch and see teamwork firsthand, as well as working together, and relationships.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I have always loved Cher's voice. She did not disappoint. I thought the songs were great, especially Favourite Scars. Well worth buying.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Just like all the other Angry Birds games this on draws you in until you run out of battery power. Love the Star war effects and sounds. I will pay until I get three stars and find all the special gifts.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|I went to see this because my son and father wanted to see it.  I did not read the book and was pretty leery about a Z movie with Brad Pitt in it.  I don't for the most part care for zombie movies.  More than any other fictional creature, they just freak me out.  I guess I have a higher than normal fear of being eaten alive, or maybe having to kill loved ones that are now zombies...who knows?  For that reason, Z movies make me pretty squirmy.<br /><br />With that being said this is NOT a zombie movie.  Just as 28 days later was NOT a zombie movie.  It's an infection movie.  I don't care what anyone says, that's how what I came away with from it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  I liked it a lot.  I would buy it on DVD or anything, but I'd probably watch it again.  It's pretty straight forward, so don't think you could really miss anything the first time around.
B00008976Y|5.0|This movie will render the viewer with Deja Vu about hiding from the tragedy of existing.<br />Even in success, life can be for-boating . When one is at the bottom the only direction left is up.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Such a nice movie. Stayed true to the book for the most part. I would recommend it! Read the book too!
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this app! I tried it out when it was the free app of the day and I am so glad I did! I still haven't completed all the levels since completing one level a night at the end of my busy day is something I have grown to look forward to. It is an ADORABLE game with lots of little things I find myself laughing out loud at when they happen. The tiny thief has quite the personality and the creators did an amazing job making each level different and entertaining. I will be very sad when I do reach the last level and beg the creators to either add more levels we can buy or create a tiny thief 2. Kudos to you for creating such an adorable entertaining game =)
B004LWZW24|2.0|There's a fine line between nodding at past films and then completely just ripping them off.  I am a huge Patick Wilson fan.  Even if I didn't like the movie he is in, I always like him.  Not true for this movie.  He was swirling around the bowl of hollywood toilets along with many other garbage movies made in this genre.<br /><br />The movie rips off Poltergiest first with startling similarities to Dead Silence, the Ring and several more not worth mentioning.  But if you've seen them, you know what I'm talking about here.<br /><br />It was such a ripoff, I expected them to even have a ghost rape scene with Barbara Hershey as a nod to the Entity as well...<br /><br />It was awful from beginning to end and it hurts me to say that about Patrick Wilson...but it's the truth
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I'm not being fair I know. But when you write such novels as The Stand, The Shining and Salem's Lot. Then you don't get fair. Let's not forget Pennywise in It. Seriously, my early years were spent being terrorized and loving it by the early Stephen King novels. The standard was set and all other writers; Peter Straub, Robert McCammon, etc. had to step up to it.<br /><br />So Mr. King do you.<br /><br />Recent novels by King have left me wanting. Pale efforts when compared to the early works. So why the four star review?<br /><br />In Doctor Sleep, there are strong moments of the Stephen King that was. The prose and character development is strong and the flow of the novel rides like a riptide, pulling you in until you are sucked down so far that you will never find your way out unless it, of its own accord, releases you.<br /><br />&#34;...He was eight now, and capable of at least some rational thought even in his horror. Partly because, in a deep part of his mind, he had been expecting this. Although he had always thought it would be Horace Derwent who would eventually show up. Or perhaps the bartender, the one his father had called Lloyd. He supposed he should have known it would be Mrs. Massey, though, even before it finally happened. Because of all the undead things in the Overlook, she had been the worst...&#34;<br /><br />Little Danny Torrance is all grown up and though haunted by the events of his childhood and that one winter isolated with his mother and father and all the haunts of the Overlook hotel, he is haunted even more by his weaknesses. The disease that took his father has its own grip on him. Little Danny Torrance is a drinking man like his father Jack before him.<br /><br />Torrance finds himself in the small town of Frazier where he decides its time to sober up. The Shining is still strong in him and he takes a job caring for the elderly and dying. It is here that he uses his gift to ease the suffering of the patients as they pass over in death. For this he is known as Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />...&#34;I don't care either way.&#34; Kingsley looked at him curiously. &#34;Dying people don't bother you?&#34;<br /> Your mother died there, Danny thought. The shine wasn't gone after all, it seemed it was hardly even hiding. You were holding her hand when she passed. Her name was Ellen.<br /> &#34;No,&#34; he said. Then for no reason why, he added. &#34;We're all dying. The world's just a hospice with fresh air.&#34;<br /><br />It is also here that he finally senses another Shining. A child who is in danger. A child much like he had been. Abra also has the Shining and she has become the target of a band of travelers who call themselves the True Knot. A group who live off the essence that leaves the Shining as they die. The more horrible the death, the stronger they feed.<br /><br />Dan Torrance must find a way to save Abra as he battles the demons that haunt him daily. He must once again become the little boy who survived that dark winter in the Overlook.<br /><br />King does a masterful job with characterization. The haunted and battling Dan Torrance is much more a reflection of the man his father was than the events of the Overlook. It is his father's memory that Danny must overcome to defeat the True Knot.<br /><br />Abra is strong and independent and a perfect foil for Torrance. He can see in her all the mistakes he had ever made waiting to happen all over again.<br /><br />If there is a flaw in Doctor Sleep is that it just isn't scary. Really, hard to understand but the sequel to one of the most terrifying novels ever written isn't really scary. There is tension and it builds and there is danger but there is no fear.<br /><br />Yet overall, it is a very good read and hopeful sign that King is regaining some of his form.

B00E6Z0THE|5.0|The game is colorful and entertaining. I tried this game when it was the free app of the day and can honestly say I picked up my kindle every spare minute I had to play this addictive game. The graphics are amazing and the puzzles are fun yet challenging in their own way.  I was so sad when I finished the game that I found other games like this one made by the same people and bought them too. Enjoy!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics and gameplay. Wish it didn't make you wait to do things so often such as importing weapons parts. Otherwise very fun.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I saw the movie but just needed to get more of a glimpse of the Oscar winning team so I purchased it to make it a permanent part of my collection instead of renting it. Looking forward to the next movie that either of the leads act in!

630514415X|5.0|Normally in films, a father bonding with his son is a peaceful scene; tossing a baseball back and forth, fishing with each other, and talking about life. However in the 1998 film, He Got Game, father and son bonding is pushed to the extreme when Denzel Washington and youthful NBA player, Ray Allen take to the big screen to portray a different side of the cliché relationship. Directed, written, and produced by the legendary Spike Lee, who I have always been a fan of and I can't name too many blemishes on Denzel Washington's filmography either. I first went into the film with great expectations and still was amazed by the content of the movie! The only spark of skepticism I had was the fact that Ray Allen had a lead role. Spike Lee didn't have to cast an NBA player for Jesus' character. Any young actor could have took the role but he gave it to someone who never acted before. Having a basketball player as the main character was a risk but Ray Allen came through and delivered a great performance.  Usually, athletes who try their hand at acting make their fans lose a bit of respect for them -- see Michael Jordan in Space Jam and Shaq in anything. He Got Game is a great film for many reasons but mainly because of the acting displays, intense plot, and the transformation of the main characters.  The movie follows number one high school basketball prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth (Allen) struggling with the decision on where he will continue his basketball career after graduating and the media that a decision like that attracts along with the strains placed on family and romantic ties. Meanwhile, in the Attica Correctional Facility, Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) is spending time in prison for murdering his wife; Jesus' mother. With everyone wanting to get Jesus to come to their respective college or professional team, the governor offers Jake Shuttlesworth less time on his sentencing if he can convince his son to play basketball for his alma mater. Jake is let go on house arrest and given a week to make this happen which really doesn't seem like enough time since his son hates the sight of him. Throughout the film, the time period switches from the present day where Jesus is making his decision to the past where he used to get physically challenged by his father on the basketball court before his mother's passing. This addition really lifts the movie and gives it more emotion.  What I really love is that the film really digs into the controversies of collegiate recruiting all while maintaining its main plot points and theme. During the recruiting process, lots of students are persuaded by cars, money, and other gifts and Spike Lee wasn't hesitant to bring light to those discrepancies throughout the movie. Jesus and his younger sister live in their own apartment where Jesus pays the rent but nothing is ever mentioned of him having a job. Also, in the beginning, Jesus' girlfriend tries to get him to meet a friend of her family who is an agent but Jesus aggressively declines and tells her \\"you know that s*** is illegal.\\" Including this in the film was genius because it makes the movie more real by showing something ugly about basketball and not just the glamorous lifestyle and flashy dunks.  Being a basketball fan, my opinion of the film may be a little bias but I loved every minute of it. It's a rather long film, clocking in at 136 minutes but it goes by so fast, it will leave viewers wanting more! With great acting from Washington and Allen, a well-polished story line, and a vintage soundtrack, this movie is one of my favorites. I don't only suggest this movie for fans who would be able to point out former NBA players' cameos and classic `90's sneakers worn throughout the film. I think anyone who loves a great, dramatic movie with intense scenes and amazing acting would enjoy He Got Game.
B002XUBDZ6|5.0|Please note that amazon decided to put every single running man movie print review under one.<br />This is DUMB.<br /><br />This is dumb becuase there are reviews on here for The RUnning Man Blu-Ray before Blu-Rays ever existed.<br /><br />If you have not seen the running man by now, don't bother, you will not like it.<br /><br />If you have watched this movie and looked to add this Blu-Ray to your collection, go for it, I did.<br /><br />Great Blu-Ray, as good as HD picture that gets for this movie, for its times.<br /><br />There is no regional issues or Blu-Ray complication like listed under other review.<br /><br />THIS IS FOR THE RUNNING MAN BLU-RAY - NOT DVD.
B0058S0OMS|3.0|I thought for being an updated version and an anniversary that there would be an ultraviolet version offered at least.
B00BSBVLF8|2.0|I went into this film having seen one trailer and wanting to love it.  Unfortunately, I almost hate it.  The trailer is sadly misleading.<br /><br />The performances are as incredible as always but none of them feel like they belong on the same stage.  Not to mention that several elements aren't present that are generally seen in a cirque du soleil production.  For one the presence of the musicians on stage,for another the two main characters don't seem to have the amount of presence in the different segments they should,and there is no crossover of performers from their own acts into others.<br /><br />The costumes are overly elaborate but never seen close enough to satisfy the curiosity of what the patterns are,and there are many performers that seem to have no point except cluttering the stage which is a shame.<br /><br />The scene changes are oddly abrupt.  The camerawork has a way of being in too close to the performers during moves that are best viewed from a distance and being distant from the performers on scenes that would be better viewed up close and the screen is often too filled with performers.  Perhaps the only moment that the camerawork and amount of visual stimuli on screen are perfectly balanced is during the breathtaking aerial act performed by the two lead characters, but even then the scene is far from perfect as the music is a soft instrumental rather than the powerful ballad that the scene needs.<br /><br />The soundtrack in general is below par.  I miss the presence of a singer on stage such as in Amaluna or Alegria. The ethereal songs found in many other Cirque du Soleil performances would have greatly improved the atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan, watch any other performance before this one.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Expertly researched and (as always) brilliantly clever, &#34;One Summer: America, 1927&#34; is every bit as good as Bill Bryson's similar efforts including &#34;At Home&#34; and &#34;A Short History of Nearly Everything.&#34; It's wry and insightful, neatly packaging a series of seemingly disconnected events into a compelling narrative that describes an important transitional period in American history. I loved it, and I learned a lot.

006202406X|5.0|*Spoilers possible*: Despite the desire of wanting a happy ending, I didn't really see it happening for tris and Tobias. I have got to say that I loved how Tris's death was done and how Veronica set it up because, for tris, Tobias conquered one of his four fears just for her. With tris, Tobias would never have even thought about going zip-lining. With both Tris's death and Uriahs death, I cried alittle bit I must say. Uriah's death is just plain sad, but with all the deaths throughout the book and the series, Veronica teaches us how to move on even if the one we love most is dead. I thought over all, the book was well written with very good teary eye moments in the end. I thank Veronica Ruth for writing this series because she teaches very important life lessons about who we are.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was very nervous to make this purchase because of the terrible reviews. The day it came out there were 79 one star reviews and 17 five star reviews. I've also been waiting for this book for a long time because I am a die hard Divergent fan. You can imagine my dilemma. The fan girl in me decided to take the chance. I was not disappointed. I watched as each character matured and I grew more attached. Allegiant delivers as the final book in the Divergent series. The  people that gave this book a bad review were expecting a happy ending that most typical sell out authors give.  Veronica Roth did not sell out. She gave a realistic storyline and ending for her series. The connection I felt with Tris and Tobias deepened and I am in awe of the risks Veronica Roth took to make this story so good. If you are looking for an ending with rainbows and butterflies, then this is not for you. I believe that Allegiant answers all questions while breaking your heart.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I haven't read the book yet. But this review request is trying to keep me from reading the book.. The end
B009LQKHIO|4.0|The author got into the meat of the book in a timely manner and made the characters seem like friends and neighbors.  It's a good book when you can put yourself there.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its about time they finally got this game on kindle ! I'm so happy been waiting for this for a while now!  Thanks !
B00ERWZYX0|5.0|Yet another fabulous addition to my granddaughter's collection! Can't wait for Christmas ! This is one that she has been looking for !!
B00G32OER4|5.0|I consider myself as a horror film expert. I have watched so many of them that i have lost count.  This film is one of the most sincere horror movies  in the past 20 years.  I like the fact that they placed little emphasis on the CG and still made me screamed because of the wonderful acting of the actors  and the eerie atmosphere.  the pace of the movie was just perfect.  I think this movie can easily be a new horror classic.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|A modern day equal to the old &#34;Godzilla&#34;.  You know it's cheesey early on, but you just won't turn it off.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Title:  Heart of Obsidian<br />Series:  Psy-Changeling Book #12<br />Author:  Nalini Singh<br />Rating:  B<br />Review:  Nalini Singh is just one of those fabulous authors that can do no wrong - Every book she writes is simply amazing.  I keep an eye out for her books and usually buy them immediately on release day, but somehow this one slipped under my radar and I am just now getting around to reading it!  Upon finding out it was Kaleb's story, it moved quickly to desperation levels!  For those of us familiar with this series, we know how important Kaleb has been in previous books - and I, for one, have always hoped that there was more good in him than just the hints we were given.<br />For the most part, I was not disappointed.  Everything that Kaleb went through to get Sahara back, all he does to protect her - it was heart wrenching.  To know that Sahara tested the limits of his control really added the razor's edge to this story.  As stoic, controlled, and emotionless as Kaleb is, it was great to see his control slip.  And can I say that having a Tk be so caught up in the moment that the glass breaks all around you is monumental.  I loved it!  I wish there had been even more of these moments throughout the book.  Sahara, for me, was a great character, meant to balance out Kaleb's \\"dark\\" with her \\"light\\".  However, I enjoyed the fact that she was not a complete Miss Goody-Two-Shoes....she has a few moments of darkness as well.  I would have liked to see a little more of those moments though, as she almost seems a little too innocent, a little too perfect.  especially after all she has been through.<br />As great as the book was, I found that it lacked a little spark in some places.  There were definite lulls, particularly throughout the middle.  Regardless, it's a Nalini Singh book - no one is more talented at creating such vivid \\"otherworld\\" for their readers.  And it's a Psy-Changeling one at that, which is my favorite series by her.  If your fan, enough said -I guarantee you won't be able to resist picking this one up!  If your new to the series, I think this one would be a bit confusing without all the back history to draw from.  I definitely recommend reading the previous books first.<br /><br />[...]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's very relaxing and very entertainment.<br />I loved this games.<br />My wife play this game all day and she love this game to

B003YL4LYI|1.0|The author just can't seem to finish. I liked the first three books. The last two just drag on and on.
B007EC27QM|1.0|This is just another calculator. Yes it does have memory and other functions but who needs another calculator on their phone?
B0086700CM|5.0|I bought this app several months ago and loved it. I had soon replaced it with other apps, and found it deleted because I hadn't played for so long. I guess I was the one who deleted it<br /> Well, anyways, this app is so much better than temple run 2 or temple run oz. It has an original feeling to it. I missed it so much. This is the first day in a long time in which I have played the original temple run and I highly recommend it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the story. Read it very quickly as its light but also heartbreaking to see how different life can be for people involved in terminal illnesses.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice Age is a fun Tapped Out app.  It has fun characters and imaginative design.  Easy game play that allows for creativity.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This series is really great. Keep in mind the war is at a lull.  All sides have been hit hard. This is the time for scheming and plotting. This is also a two part book! Can't wait to see what happens next.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|You loose lives to quick and it takes too long to get them back so the game is kind of a pain...
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Super!!!! This set was a great price and my set got here on time. I am a very satisfied customer.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Ugh.  I kept hoping it would get better.  You get the sense the guy's a good writer.  But it just kept dragging on and on and all of it depressing.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|A dazzling journey down a trivia and fact filled highway to the people, events and attitudes of the Twenties.  A tad too heavy on aviation for my taste, but otherwise I loved it.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Since this album has been released, I'm sure I've listened to it more than a hundred times because it is SO GOOD and never gets old. I do have my personal favorites on this album, but there is not a single song I don't find to be fantastic. My personal favorites? Won't Let Up, Not That Beautiful, and Before I Die. My music preferences revolve a lot around the quality of the lyrics, and based on that, this album is definitely in my top 5 albums of all time. This album is not one to be cherry picked for the 'hits' - every song is a masterpiece. I think it's safe to say that a big portion of Jacoby's best lyrics are contained within The Connection. I love all of Papa Roach's other albums, but this is my favorite and what I think is their best work. A lot of bands become kind of 'blah' over the years, and yet PR just continues to evolve and get better. Buy this album!!!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Each episode a dramatic jewel. Would recommend to anyone. Same words as my comments on season one episodes. I have already ordered seasons three and four.
B00E7RZEI0|2.0|I just chose 2 star to be the first to do so on a popular game. Its actually a pretty fun game.
1451696191|5.0|i love this book! it's probably my favorite, I've read it twice so far.<br />but it does talk about sex, and drugs, etc.... kind of awkward to read sometimes. i have that all scribbled out in my copy. i really love this book, and i would recommend it to my friends. but i'd also, give them my copy to borrow, so they wouldn't have to read all the crap.......so yeah
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I purchased this album after hearing &#34;Next To Me&#34;.  I then listened to the rest of the album and was extremely impressed.  Emeli has an AMAZING voice (Named #1 breakout artist in the UK last year) and should be better known in the US.  Extremely impressed and now a huge fan!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Awesome, compelling, intense. The highest drama I've ever seen on television. Every character well done. How is it possible that one or several of these actors did not receive individual Emmys?
B004UID2LC|1.0|I rather use other software. Sound quality for downloads is poor and doesn't have much customizing or tweaks. User interface is also poor.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Plenty of room, well padded, stays in place well. I can even fit a compact tripod inside.  I definitely recommend it!
B00B89WXYS|4.0|I purchased this album when their only single off of it was &#34;Feel Again&#34;.  After listening to the rest of the album I was very impressed.  I have only been a fan of a few of their songs in the past.  Some of my new favorites are &#34;If I lose Myself&#34; &#34;Something I Need&#34; and &#34;Preacher&#34;.  Now officially a fan!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thus game is amazing i love it so much i play it all the time now that its on th  kindle fire
006202406X|2.0|This book gets two stars because it is twice as good as anything I could write. Three stars were retracted because it was only 2/5 the book it could have been. Two-dimensional descriptions of kissing sessions are not a substitute for romance. People who are sophisticated enough to monitor every moment of every person's life in a city don't let teenagers run around unsupervised in government compounds. The promise of the first (excellent) book has gone unfulfilled, at least for this reader.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a new spin on the bejeweled series and it's fun, and strategy as well.  I like it because it's not boring and although easy to play, it's also very challenging.
B009EANE3M|3.0|I purchased this album for &#34;Hall of Fame&#34; which was played a lot on the radio.  I have since then listened to the other songs on album and was not extremely impressed.  I do not hate any of the songs but I would not go out of my way to listen to any of them.  Acts as background music for me.
B00BD6KPFU|4.0|Can't wait for the next season. Love the love and hate relationship of Mike and Rachel. Go Donna, just sassy and sexy ever.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|Joseph Heller's Catch 22 is probably the funniest book I have ever read. Of course, beneath the humour and is a scathing satire, but it's the brilliant homour that really captured me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow people choose to play this then play it again it's better than other games I love this game so much i will die for it
B00ESNE696|5.0|The story lines for this show just keep getting juicier. This is one of the best dramas on TV. I could watch this all day long.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My entire family loves this game, even my 5 year old. Fun and challenging. The downside is that it's incredibly additive.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|I hadn't read any Bradbury since high school. Rediscovering him through this book was a wonderful experience. I was really blown away by the poetry of Bradbury's prose.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|I cant say I've ever heard of M83, but I am a fan movie scores. And in that regard, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It reminds me of what Daft Punk did for Tron Legacy.
B005OP821K|5.0|Season 1 of this show was absolutely amazing. I was a devoted Gossip Girl fan for many years. This show fills the void!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is very helpful. You can choose multiple locations, and you don't have to be there to get the weather info.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|My only complaint was it dragged a bit in the middle, but I read the special anniversary edition with additional content, so I wonder if the original version moved a bit quicker. Anyway, definitely a wonderful book.
B003MXB4FC|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but $4 seems like a bit much for a 24-hour rental. I expected it to be cheaper, especially as a Prime member.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I could not believe that I saw this game listed on kindle. I cannot go back to playing it on my phone because it looks so much better on Kindle! Plus, now I don't have to carry around several devices just enjoy my everyday apps. Great job guys!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy read, fun , flirty on edge, page turner, provocative, and super sexy!! Great for book clubs of a more mature audience.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted!!!!!  I cannot quit playing.  Recommend to all my friends.  It is the best game I have ever played.  So glad Kindle finally got it.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|This is a very well done shoot-em up game. The graphics a bright and vibrant. Lots a powerups and very challenging without being frustrating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun, and everyone is playing it! Join in the party! Ask your friends for help then try to beat your friends scores!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|buy this app if u download this on kindle tire keep trying tell it downloads cause awesome game just may take a while to download on kindle fire.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|how much hatte mail did reloaded get huh. they were obviously from other companies trying to get their games on the map
B00FX8EY60|4.0|I love her new style and sound.  The bass on her track with Juicy J is amazing! I really like Spiritual, it might be a new favorite of mine!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was not at all what I expected- it was better. It is so painfully and beautifully written. There were many times when I would stop and reread a sentence because the author put together a thought or sentence that jumped off the page. It is an upsetting book, dealing very realistically with the Holocaust and Germany during WWII. On the other hand, it has so many pure moments of joy and human goodness that I wasn't in a state of depression reading it. I highly recommend this book.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|I've got whiplash.  It is amazing to me that these old geezers for whom I have been listening to for 30 years now can still let loose like this.<br /><br />I am partial to my very first Motorhead LP I ever purchased - \\"Bomber\\" and the releases around that era \\"Overkill\\", \\"Ace Of Spades\\", \\"Iron Fist\\", and even \\"Another Perfect Day\\".  While I have skipped purchasing some Motorhead albums here and there over time (I believe I am without 6 of their studio albums) I have to say this is NOT one to skip by any means.  There is not a clunker on this Album at all!  Lemmy and the boys went all out on this one.  It seems to me they took a big dose of their early material and mixed in enough of their more recent sound to come up with an album that is sure to please all Motorheadbangers.  The production is great.  You better be buckled in when you turn this on!<br /><br />The first two songs will knock you out then you get a little Lemmy blues song to ease the pace, but you better watch out because song 4 - End Of Time will send an upper cut your way.  Then on track 5 you get a Chuck Berry groove Do You Believe at Motorheadspeed....  I won't go on with the assessment because it is more top notch Motorhead with Death Machine and beyond.....<br /><br />I have to add - Dust And Glass is a killer song, it must be Lemmy's version of a lullaby.<br /><br />easily 5 Stars.  We should all be happy Lemmy is around to show people what real Metal and attitude is about.  Thank you Motorhead.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I gave this an all stars.  The DVD was in perfect condition.  I would recommend this to all my friends who collect DVD's.  Also, thanks for the prompt delivery.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|One word to describe the music of Skrillex, besides good, is angry. I didn't know music could get angry until I heard Skrillex.
0307951529|4.0|I haven't had the time to implement any really good ideas. I haven't given up.  When I'm ready I have my book.
B006YZOXHQ|3.0|Problem is, that even though the picture restoration is great, the sound is out of context with the picture, making it irritating to watch.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|All stars.  My dvd set came in perfect condition.  I would recommend this to all my friends who collect movies.  Thank you for the prompt service as well.  =)
0694003611|5.0|A true classic book to read to your children.  I read this to mine and to my grand-children and hope to be able to read to my great-grand-children.  “Goodnight stars, goodnight air, goodnight noises everywhere.”
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Extremely addicting and I ended up watching the entire series in 4 nights.  Season 3 will probably be even better!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game would be better if you didn't have to constantly wait for more lives!  Otherwise, the game is fun.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|When I purchased the book, there were only about 12 reviews, mostly bad, and I skimmed enough to get the idea that something really bad happens and a lot of people are angry about it. I'm a 33 year-old woman and I'm so glad my kids were in bed and my husband was not home when I read the end.  I cried so much I'm almost ashamed of it. But, I think there is something to be said about an author who can create such a story and such characters that the reader becomes that emotionally affected. I've read plenty of books, and I've never been so heart-wrenched by a story before, yet so satisfied with the outcome.<br /><br />I think it was beautiful and - sad as it was - the perfect way to end the story. Many of the other positive reviews are right - I don't particularly want unhappy endings, but mushy perfect \\"happy\\" stories make me want to vomit. It's not always meaningful.<br /><br />But, really, it DID have a happy ending. Tris sacrificed herself so that the man and the friends she loved don't have to live in a world where they are seen as damaged. No one else could have given that kind of gift. Plus, she didn't do it just to die for her friends - she honestly thought she could survive, and I think that makes a big difference. There are so many other good things to say about this trilogy - hints that these characters believe in God, suicide isn't a solution out of a tricky situation (which is my biggest complaint about another popular trilogy), and all of the characters come full circle in so many ways.<br /><br />I don't understand why so many are complaining about the writing style or it being boring. It's the same as the other books. This one may have had a little less action, but the characters were in a new situation and had to take time to adjust and figure out what was going on. Makes perfect sense. And, I don't understand why everyone is also being critical of Evelyn's choice. Yeah, it might have been her life's work, but it cost her child. Have you never suddenly realized something you were working on wasn't worth it anymore? She was tired, she was beginning to doubt.  So when she was given a way out, a way to get back what she finally realized was important, she took it. It all makes perfect sense.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've heard so much hype about the game and finally tried it on my kindle fire. It met my expectations plus some. I have to play it every day.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is highly similar to the Rosetta Stone software, except this app makes learning a language fun. I am currently flying through German, and I have to say that it is as easy as taking a language class with a human teacher. It lets you work at your own pace and helps build on what you learn. Like my Spanish III teacher said in high school, &quot;Take what you know, and let it grow!&quot;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't stop playing this fast-paced, addicting game. The challenges keep you coming back for more. I can't wait for more levels. I love the Halloween neighborhood.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|I was unimpressed when I first listened to Burials.  I love AFI.  Their best works are Sing the Sorrows and December Underground (I feel)  This is different.  More Black Audio influence.  But after listening to it carefully several times, the CD grew on me.  If you enjoy your misanthropic tendencies as much as I do, AFI will not disappoint you with Burials.  Love the darkness. Perfect mood enhancer for our troubled times.  I think this is a must addition to any AFI collection.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read, as soon as I started reading it I couldn't stop, this book is amazing!
B001BANK32|5.0|Although I had seen and loved the movie many times, I hadn't read the book.  I decided to do so prior to reading Doctor Sleep. All I can say is....read the book!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I like the medium size ear buds the best. The rubber ones are my preference. These work well and fit the same as the original one that came with the earpiece.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This is the dumbest app and it doesn't work. The video wouldn't load and you have to pay to download. All you see when you click on the video is ads. If you like to spend your time waiting an hour for your video to play, it would be a good app for you.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I had to stay up late to finish reading this book. Great characters and a great story with a thought provoking ending.
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|Would be more exciting on a bigger screne. I have it on my i-pad. Little repetitious and juvenile for me. The graphics are cute and colorful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun!  I love the costume you canby in the store with bannanas and the app is FREE.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down!! This book I  absolutely amazing the twists and turns are amazing and an ending you'd never expect!!!!!
014242613X|5.0|My grandson loves the series of theses books. Higher reading levels can be very explicit. Boone's books are interesting without being overly detailed in the description of crime scenes.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|I will admit this movie cleverly tied into the first and veered enough away from the format of the first two to make it fresh. I did not find this movie nearly as funny as the first. Alan and Chow had some funny scenes but noting over the top like in the first.
B00C5R7F8G|3.0|While I was expecting a report style book, the author tries to hard to make it a novell type narrative with frequent time changes, flashbacks and getting into the characters involved in particular accidents. Entertaining at times, annoying at others when really I would prefer chronological order.<br />Overall it achieves what I was looking for, i.e. getting a sense of military nuclear safety or the lack thereof, the unexpected amount of almost catastrophies and the at times scary attitude of military leadership.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm not giving it 5 stars for 2 reasons:<br />1. Because Tris died<br />2. Because the book got boring in several chapters<br />But I really love more of Tobias' vantage point, but honestly when it was Tris's chapter I was more excited<br />I really enjoyed it! One of those books you can't put down.
0525425772|5.0|My grandson loves the series of theses books. Higher reading levels can be very explicit. Boone's books are interesting without being overly detailed in the description of crime scenes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Who hasn't played this game or heard of it!?! It's awesome and its now on the kindle! let the enjoyment begin. :)
B00992CF6W|3.0|I played minecraft on xbox and I loved it so I figured let me buy it so when I bought it I created a world in creative mode and it turns out you cant even blow up tnt!  very dissatisfied
B00992CF6W|5.0|The only thing I don't like is that realms still doesn't work and;  have 0.7.6 sometimes it confusing but realms should work
B00FPH6A70|5.0|This is the best scary movie made in years. It didn't have to be grotesk but will make you jump out of your seat a few times. Maybe leave you with a few nightmares when you go to sleep. :) Good story line and great acting. Enjoy - perfect to watch around Halloween.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Wonderful package of a great record. First of all the remaster of the Brothers and Sisters album is wonderful sounds better then ever. This is such a great record it holds up well but then most of the songs are still active in the Allman Brothers' songbook. I heard them play half this album last summer. But thpe fun is just starting next is a cd full of rehearsals jams and outakes which is totally different from the album itself. Of course to anything with Barry on it is such a treat. I did get to see the band live with Barry sadly Duane died while I was in Vietnam. Now is the great part the two discs of their Winterland show which made it worth even penny I paid for this box set. This version of the Allman Brothers can play and play they do there are plenty of deep jams. Listening to them you would never think they just added two new people they sound like they have been together forever. There is so much to love here and love you will. This is a must have for any Allman Brothers fan.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Classics like The Conjuring are timeless.  It doesn't matter when they came out, it's about HOW they are done.  Had this movie come out in 1972, ignorant critics would call The Exorcist a ripoff and make stupid comments like \\"go see the Conjuring for real scares.\\"  This would be up there (and I believe it will be)with  The Innocents, The Haunting, The Changeling, and The Exorcist.  It has perfect pacing, atmosphere, acting, style, and scares.  It even has the retro 70's early 80's look of the perfect horror film.  All horror movies should strive for that look since it's what the best ones are made up of.  And for the haters, so what if there is nothing new?  This might as well have been a lost gem from a long time ago, that you just stumbled across in an old video store. And as for the haters that want to troll on religion, you must have all the answers to all the questions in the universe (which that I know for a fact you don't) and have no sense of imagination (possibly a good reason you can't enjoy a good film).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am one of many people to play and discover the wonders and \\"powers\\" of Candy Crush Saga!  Why do I love this game?  I love to play Candy Crush Saga because of many levels, and the challenges I have to face in order to the next level.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Just freash off that wonderful Europe 72 tour they are firing hot in all areas. The concert is simply wonderful. Now I must tell you I got the limited addition from GD Net that includes the beautiful book covering every angle of this event. This was a benefit show for the creamery ouned by Ken Kensey's brother. A great set list with all those new songs that were coming out at this time well really before the Europe tour Jerry and Bobby were writing some really good music both releasing great albums filled with songs so strong that most stayed in the Grateful Dead songbook throughout the rest of their time together most are here plus a great Dark Star. The one sad note Pigpen was too ill to come with them. Now the dvd is surprisingly simply wonderful considering how old the film is and it laying around all these years. To have a dvd of the Grateful Dead from this time is a real treat. I have to say I could have done without the naked guy. The packaging is beautiful more then the addition in stores and along with the book is worth every penny the recording is just so good it sounds so fresh and new for a concert that took place over forty years ago. Yes this is a great one and hey it made the Billboard charts and that is strange for the Grateful Dead but then it has been a long strange trip.
0756633311|5.0|Needed this version of the book for my daughter's AP Lit class.  Fair price, considering it is out of print and hard to find.  Would use this vendor again, but they need to do a better job packaging their books - it got squished a little in transit.  No problem, though...
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The &#34;zombies&#34; are terrifying and Brad Pitt kicks major ass!
B008JFUR10|5.0|I get it when people feel the need to blast a movie for one reason or another, but if you are looking at this movie, you want to be entertained and see something that will make you feel good about parting with your hard earned duckets. This movie actually made me laugh a few times just out of simple enjoyment. It is a rare event when you are enjoying yourself so much that you have a moment of spontaneous laughter.<br /><br />As for the movie...yep, giant transformers operated by humans doing battle with souped up Godzilla-like beasts on steroids. Human race on the verge of being wiped out...so basically Independence Day's script with robots. There is even one scene that I swear was word for word out of ID. That did not detract from the movie for me in the least. It is fun, and that is really all you can hope for when you sit down to watch a film.

B00BEIYMIS|1.0|All around not a good movie. It uses all the same patterns as the other &#34;based on true events&#34; movies as well as the &#34; captured footage&#34; mockumentaries. You can see it, build up, build up, fake scare; oh it was just the cat (example). Mild scare, fake scare, BIG SCARE. You could set your watch to this movies generic pacing.<br />Worth a rental but don't waste your money to purchase it.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy, the books and the movies. I think Peter Jackson did a wonderful job and was faithful to the letter and the spirit of the books. I am also a huge fan of The Hobbit, the book but not the movie. In written word, the beauty of the LOTR lies in its exquisite detail; conversely, the beauty of The Hobbit is in its elegant simplicity. It seems like Jackson is trying to make the Hobbit another LOTR, and that just isn't working for me. The movie, while visually spectacular, has no charm. And as one critic wrote - &#34;You shouldn't be able to read a book faster than you can see it play out on-screen.&#34;
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|I had heard, in advance of buying this, that it was not too good.  Certainly, not the exact angelic quality of the actual '60's music with all the originals (RIP Dennis and Carl), but some tunes stood out.  Many live sets did inspire and got the toes tapping.  If you have followed the BB from the beginning, this might be a nice piece to at least to round out your personal old collection, with out having to dust off the old record player.  Thinking it over, I'm glad I bought it. It is good to listen to with the volume up and the top down on that Mustang convertible - especially road trips.  Tempered, of course, with a little Larry Chance and The Earls thrown in as you cruise through Sonic or an old Mel's.  BTW, Happy Birthday, Larry.

B00D6DVSAE|1.0|For someone that has tried to get rid of his Geordie accent for the past 30 years its seems quite pretentious and quite self piteous to want to regain it only to put out an album based on rehashed material as well as going back to his roots.  Also for a man who has time again and again stated \\" I am not the nostalgic type\\" when speaking about returning to the Police he most definitely is not as careful to  say the same about his own solo stuff.  I really have been waiting for Sting to come back with new material as he is one of the  few great rock musicians who is also one of the best songwriters of the past 35 years.  However this latest project comes short of coming to some kind of meaning and more of a vanity project.  As much as I am looking for redemption, my final wish for Sting is to rethink his decision to nail the coffin on the Police.

006202406X|5.0|This has been one of my favorite series to come out in a while.  I think the plot and character development over the three books was remarkable and was always gripping.  The third book does a really good job of developing Tris as a strong confident individual and I really loved how Roth developed the relationship between Tris and Tobias.  The relationship made both of them stronger, but was not the most essential part of who they were as people, which I think is a great message to send to young women.  I do agree with reviewers that although it was fun to see Tobias point of view, the voices were not distinguished well enough and sometimes I wasn't sure who was talking.  Now to the part that seems to be pissing everyone off, the ending (I'm going to try to avoid spoilers but still will probably give more away qualifying it as spoilerish so be warned).<br /><br />**Spoiler**  So I get the anger regarding the ending, I felt upset and was pissed off.  My heart broke for the characters.  HOWEVER, it was a good ending.  So much of Tris's development is reconciling those disparate parts of herself, she is divergent, she is dauntless, erudite , and abnegation, but struggles to reconcile all these parts of herself.  The ending allowed her to call on all parts of herself and in her final scene is all the factions but mostly and most importantly she is herself.  And I think the part that is pissing everyone off is actually the most important part of her character development.  One of the most important themes of the book was both her rebellion and yearning for her parents values.  She both respected and wanted to act in the way consistent with her family and the ones she loved (because even Tobias stood for the abnegation value of selflessness), but she realized that she could be defined by just the abnegation values.  Her final act was the final integration of all her values, including selfless sacrifice, and I thought really represented who she had become. Her story was leading to her developing into her person, I thought that final act was a true representation of that person.  Plus, I think Roth's handling of what happened was masterful.  I think Tobias reaction was both realistic and gave hope for the future.  I loved that we continued to get several chapters in order to process what happened and although the ending made me cry I also felt hopeful for that world's future.  I felt like the trilogy earned its grief and hope, making it an exceptionally well done story.
0425263908|4.0|Very Hot right from the beginning!! Great book...just wish it was longer. Could not put it down for one minute.
006202406X|2.0|What a disappointment!  I am so sad.  The ending was unnecessary! All of the characters contradicted their personalities until this point. This story was not well developed. I'd rather let me imagination finish the story. I have been counting down days to finish this series, greatly anticipating the ending. I am so sad to say, that after finishing Allegiant, I am so let down. There was no satisfaction in reading this. Only sorrow.  I found myself just skimming the last chapters... no longer caring what was read. I would have waited 10 years for her to write a good story!

B007FEFLTO|1.0|The first book in this series was excellent. This one is nothing at all like it. I doubt it was even written by Follet. The plot is contrived, the characters are flat, dull, and unlikeable. I wish there was a negative number I could give this book. I couldn't even get past the first 100 pages. Don't waste your time or your money on this pile of excrement.

1594487154|4.0|I spent a lot less time reading Dan Pink's latest book, To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others, than I spent thinking about it. Pink's insights are targeted to two readers: those who know they are in sales and those who think they aren't. That covers everybody, and I think every reader will benefit from some aspect of this interesting book. I enjoyed the way Pink presents his insights: he observes what changes are happening (we're all in sales now); he observes how the best sales people behave; and he offers ways in which each of us can do different things to sway others. Pink's writing is always lively and accessible, and he refers often to research that has led him, and can lead us, toward greater understanding of ourselves and others.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)

0316204366|5.0|Any reader who spends a little while with Malcolm Gladwell's book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants, will think about advantages and disadvantages in new ways. The conversational narrative style that Gladwell uses so expertly draws readers into the stories he presents, and helps us see an issue more comprehensively that we might have without his help. For me, the counter-intuitive exploration of class size in school was very interesting. The way in which Gladwell described how the shepherd David exploited his own strengths and Goliath's weaknesses helped me see a familiar story in a new way. I've frequently enjoyed the way in which Gladwell can take the research of others and explain it to me and others with simplicity and clarity. That's a gift to readers who are looking for something to read quickly in small spurts.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)

B00BD99JMW|2.0|Before I read Divergent I suspected that Roth was riding the dystopian wave and had very low expectations of the book. I was pleasantly surprised by it and looked forward to the next two books. Insurgent was disappointing, but I chalked that up to the \\"sophomore curse\\" and expected Allegiant to be far better. It's not--in fact, it's a very poor effort.<br /><br />The problem with the book is not the ending. I can get on board with the choice Roth makes--in the abstract. For that to work, however, the rest of the book has to be totally on point. Instead, it's a mess, with way too many new characters, too much exposition, and too much internalizing by the characters. There were times when I just wished the characters would DO something, anything. When they did, it was usually violence that had little point to it except to kill off characters Roth failed to make me care about.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because of the controversy about the ending, some famous authors are defending Roth as \\"brave.\\" What she did is not \\"brave\\" within the context of an intensely mediocre book. Now looking back on it, it's clear to me the potential of the first book was never realized, making the entire series a misfire.<br /><br />I LIKE books--especially books about war--to NOT pull punches and to have the guts to make readers suffer. But for me, the suffering wasn't from the ending--it was from trying to slog through a dull and ultimately pointless book.

PKD has a knack for making it possible to make all the different frames of reference very clear to the reader in a way I thought was only possible with moving images. I am currently reading another PKD book and I still smirk and have tingles down my spine as he deftly creates a world that is both science and fiction. You never stop thinking about the \\"seeds\\" of the book even after you put it down.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I am loving this entire series. Just finished Season 3 and waiting for Season 4 on DVD. I always watch them in order, so not watching random samples on HBO [as it airs right now] is not a problem. I want to follow the story in the way it was designed to be seen. I'll be a good boy and wait for Season 4. This is a collector series. Something that can be viewed numerous times. The Producers Cut gives excellent narration of the making of the series.<br /><br />A must have for all true fans and armchair movie makers.<br /><br />Good Luck.

B00571F26Y|1.0|Although I am sure wheat has changed through the years, to blame it for all of our ills is a stretch.  I do agree that the amount of carb the food piramid allows is wrong.  I cannot keep my blood sugar in an acceptable range if I allowed myself that much.  What about sugar?  We are bombarded daily with advertisments for sugar laden foods and processed snacks.  It's all our kids know.  How many kids want to snack on a handfull of nuts, or kale chips?  Seriously, save your money, don't buy this book.  Eat more veggies lay off the junk food.

0553381407|5.0|Too many people and books will try to get you to buy the lie that you have to forgive someone to let go and move on with your life.  And no one tells you to \\"forgive\\" more than the very people who have abused you because they are the ones who will gain from it the most as it will allow them an opportunity to enter your life whenever they need to suck some more blood out of you.  These people use the word forgiveness to mean letting go and the fact is that those two things have nothing to do with each other.  Letting go has to do with ACCEPTANCE not forgiveness.  This is a very important distinction for victims of abuse to get.  For me it wasn't until the day I finally made it clear that I would never forgive that I finally accepted the abuse I endured and finally let it all go.  It was the day I cried my last tears over them and started my new life.  I also completely cut them out of my life.  That was many years ago soon after I read this book and my only regret many years later is that I didn't do so sooner.<br /><br />They also go into the abuser's partner- usually the mother- who can claim that they had no power to stop the abuse or to leave the abuser when the truth is often that they have chosen the abuser over their own child. But they pretend victimhood in order to save themselves from punishment or accusation while still enabling the abuse and even supporting it.  If they continue to make excuses for the abuser or act one way when they are speaking with you alone while putting you down when the abuser is in the room with them etc... then you know you are not dealing with a victim here, but a manipulator.  This book covers everything and after you do what it instructs you will know whether its healthier to sever the relationship for good or not.  Highly recommended.

006202406X|4.0|Consistent with Divergent and Insurgent, Roth’s writing is straightforward and to the point.  When reading fantasy or adventure, I prefer this style as it lends itself to the story.  I am ready to dive in to the action, I don’t need to read a sentence three times to figure out what it was supposed to mean.<br /><br />The novel is told from both Tris and Tobias’s points of view, and while it is a nice change to be able to look outside of Tris’s head, I found it hard to distinguish the two at times.  I usually gloss over chapter title’s and often missed that this chapter was titled Tris and that chapter was titled Tobias.  However, it did highlight some of the similarities between the two characters.  They want desperately to be honest and up front with each other, but are constantly worried what the other might think of their actions, their choices and their ideas.  There is something intensely juvenile about it, they truly are just two kids trying to figure it out and worrying about what the other is going to think.  Beyond that they seem unable to keep their hands off each other, and instead of telling each other important things they end up making out half of the time. Hormones man, they’ll get ya.<br /><br />There were many moments where I was seeing flashing red lights and hearing sirens in my head, yelling at Tris and Tobias “DANGER! DANGER!”, but of course being autonomous characters they did not listen to me and went right along making bad decisions.  WILL THEY NEVER LEARN? For two people who have a lot of good reasons not to trust anyone, they are certainly easily swayed by people they have never met before who live in a world beyond the fence that they are unfamiliar with and who they know have been keeping secrets and manipulating them FOR GENERATIONS. There is one character is particular who as soon as she popped up I knew it is going nowhere good. Nope.<br /><br />On the outside, it is really no different. There is the obvious separationbetween the have and the have-nots, which clearly points to race relations and the treatment of the poor in the United States we live in – and my apologies to Ms. Roth, but it’s not particularly well done.  It’s very stereotypical and overt, and not as nuanced as I have come to expect from her. Rather it feels like a rushed decision and it does a disservice to the plot, causing me to roll my eyes as if I were reading a social justice blog on Tumblr.  At times it felt as if she was throwing in certain things for the sake of political correctness, and it gave it less authenticity.<br /><br />The one thing Roth has always been successful at, is making me so passionately angry that I think I may explode and then giving me the sweet  satisfaction of seeing it play out in my favor. Until that moment where it’s like you are watching a horror film and you want to slap your hands over your eyes, shielding your vision from what you know is coming and of course you can’t do that because you are reading a book. So you keep reading.<br /><br />This book is an emotional roller-coaster conclusion to the series. Roth does things authors should never do to their readers, but makes it worth it.  There were so many moments where I was so intensely frustrated and ready to throw this book (or my nook, rather) across the room.  But I kept reading and chapters later I would be able to take a breath again, just for the cycle to repeat.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Roth’s intentions are clear.  This book is not about being Dauntless, Abnegation, Erudite, Amity or Candor, it is about finding balance. It is about letting go of what deserves to be let go, and holding on to love with everything you have.  True bravery has it’s foundations in love, in faith, and in family and Roth makes that eloquently clear, because for those whom you love you can always find a reason to be brave.<br /><br />I just wanted to add, after having read some of the other less stellar reviews I’mjust a little disappointed in the readers. I feel like we set our expectations for a certain outcome, and when the author made a different choice, punished her for it because it was not the stereotypical “perfect” or “happy” ending.<br /><br />That does not mean the message was not hopeful.  That the characters did not overcome the inevitable odds, or that they were left damaged and broken without hope or happiness.  That is incredibly untrue.  It was the whole point!  That with our brokenness, with our human condition to hurt each other and take what we feel belongs to us, we can learn.  We can heal each other and by way of that heal ourselves.  There is NEVER a world without hope.  There is no death that can take that hope away from us, no tragedy that can rip it from our grasping fingers.  And even when we are ready to give in to hopelessness, even when we are crumbling beneath the weight of our histories, the weight of our choices, and the ever expanding weight of our love, we will find a way to lift it.<br /><br />That is the message.  That is hope.  That is powerful writing.

0800141865|5.0|I enjoy this dvd! I am a big fan of Woody Harrelson! The movie actually inspires me to pursue my goals no matter what!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that candy crush is on kindle fire finally.  This game really rocks. Now I play it every where I take my kindle.
B00005K9LM|5.0|What a freakin' awesome album! I'm at awe. A collection of perfect metal masterpieces. And &#34;Love Bites&#34; stands out unique. Amen
B00D6QU6RW|3.0|There are two good tracks on this CD, the rest of the tracks are so, so.  As a former Backstreet Boys fan, this CD does not measure up and overall was a disappointment.
1419705849|5.0|I mentor a special needs 3rd grader.  To assess his true interest in reading, I &#34;introduced&#34; him to this Wimpy Kid book.  He pounced on it with excitement and we had a good reading session.  Then he surprised me.  He already had one of the books.  He begged me to let him take this one home and go on reading, to which I agreed if he promised to keep it in his backpack so we could use it at my next visit.  I was first introduced to the Wimpy Kid when I gave my niece's twin sons the multi-volume pack.  They went crazy over them.These books are addictive and reading becomes an adventure for early readers.  There's a &#34;plus&#34; to these books.  Handwriting is no longer part of the school curriculum.  In my reading group, I encounter a lot of unreadable writing.  I shall be using the wimpy kid to teach my special boy how to write!

B00DYEBM2Y|3.0|Overall this is a great album, the vinyl sounds very good and is mastered very well.  The album doesn't come across as powerful as Mazzy Star's previous attempts to me.  But it is still a must own if you are a Mazzy fan.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|For the price, I am totally satisfied with this watch. The minutes are marked largest around the dark green face with smaller hour numbers which is nice for quick reading. I find the myself adjusting the time by <1 minute every week or so. My one qualm is that it lacks hacking so I can't be exactly sure of its accuracy but I suppose I don't need down to the second accuracy anyway.<br /><br />The band is solid and doesn't stay to wet. There are many holes so you can pick just the right one. While I'm on water, this watch is only suitable for light rain exposure, not swimming or showering, see Seiko's definitions or water resistance.<br /><br />The lume is as others said, it is easily readable with dark adjusted eyes all through the night.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|What starts out as a simple journey ends with a surprising revelation. Ms. Joyce builds her story a step at a time and the outcome is well worth the trip.
B0011Z3DK2|5.0|I love 4, but every year houses grows more and more on me. It might soon be my favorite zeppelin record.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Warning, this is a very addictive game.  Need friends to play also because assistance is need to proceed to new levels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing it just had me breathless. Ms. Hoover did an amazing job writing on a difficult subject matter. It's definitely one of the best of 2013.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Stephen King stories aren't my genre of preference, yet this personal account is so human, artistically detailed and filled with real life humor that it's become a wonderful reading experience. I love to see how and why a storyteller tells his/her stories and how those stories reach their audience. The writing is warm, always entertaining, humorous and artistically inspiring.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|just one of the best movies ... don't miss to see it... all in this movie are great...too bad that Hollywood don't produce this excellent movie
B009G41CG2|2.0|If there is, I haven't been able to figure out how to get clues. There are times when I swear there is no more moves but it doesn't end. I have seen it once though so I know it has the feature. There isn't any level adjustments either. You can't remove one tile and then the one under it. Not my fav
B001G5ZNEQ|5.0|Herbie composed the tunes, but it's Freddie Hubbard that steals the show in this modal masterpiece. Listen to his solo on &#34;Eye of the Hurricane&#34;—his explosive trumpet playing, paired with the tasteful saxophone of George Coleman make this nautical-themed work a  treasure as soon as the ship leaves port.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great sleep machine.  So many sounds,  you can have multiple sounds at once and control value separate for each sound.  Love the timer function.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Read the reviews before it was released in cinemas, so I was pretty much discouraged to see it. Decided to give it a chance by renting it and I found it to be enjoyable. It's a movie for kids with a lesson to be learned, can't really be too critical of it. The graphics were good, but I will say the accents that the characters had were really silly.
B00D1VKZ3M|4.0|I am a big fan of BJ so was worried if I would like this book. I did like it - I was perhaps a bit disappointed they didn't try something new - she is exactly the same just older. I think if they had tried to do something new people wouldn't like it though ......... I hope Darcy comes out of the wood work in the next book.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I enjoy it watching it from my kindle And streaming from prime for free is great....can get addicting. But Jax......o.m.g. too gorgeous for words!
B0074ALZ7Q|4.0|Love this story - very readable and different yet could happen today. Definitely worth a read. The characters were likable and the suspense was well done.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This is one of those movies where everything gels. The story was great, the actors perfectly cast, and the direction and cinematography also great. I'm glad that I have it on Blu-ray so I can watch it whenever I want.
B004LUS390|5.0|SketchBook Mobile is a lighter version of the more powerful SketchBook Pro, which in my opinion is among the best drawing programs available for Android right now. To be honest, I was a little skeptical about the practicality of a powerful drawing program on a small screen. But after testing out this app on the HTC One (4.7&#34; 1080P) and Rezound (4.3&#34; 720P), it's definitely doable and actually surprisingly fun.<br /><br />The app has a pretty intuitive user interface optimized for touch, although there is a learning curve. Fingers will work okay, but a stylus will definitely make it easier to draw finer details with greater control. Neither HTC phones I tested the app with has pressure sensitive screen, which adds a lot to the drawing experience especially with a stylus. I'll update my review later if I get some testing time in with a Note 3, which has both stylus and a pressure-sensitive screen. Layer support is present, and it also supports saving into the usual list of image file formats. I imported a small photoshop file (PSD) with 3 layers and it opened up without problems.<br /><br />The permissions required are reasonable, and the installed footprint on the phone is efficient at 8.3MB. So far, I haven't encountered any ads or force closes/crashes.<br /><br />All in all, SketchBook Mobile is a powerful drawing program where the developer definitely took care to optimize for use on small screen devices. To realize the app's full potential, you probably need a stylus. I'd say it's worth the asking price, and definitely worth checking out today as the free app of the day.
B006MPKDD6|4.0|All the twists and turns made me keep reading.  Thoroughly enjoyed. My first Michael Connelly book, there will be more now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It finally arrived!  I haven't had any problem with it yet!  Thank you for getting the app.  I don't know why we had to wait for so long but thank you!
B000L3CHC0|4.0|I bought it for my dad. It's well priced for the brand and is a light and classy watch. The dial is quite thick, but does not seem odd.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|So far I have only used it to charge cell phones which require far less 5V power then its rated for. I expect it can be use to charge almost any USB device.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have loved this series from the moment I picked up Divergent. I have recommended it to anyone needing a good read. She writes simply but that makes it flow and always you to fall into her words without thought.<br /><br />However, I did not expect to be this disappointed in the ending. Would a Daunltess trained person be killed by someone in a wheelchair? Did everybody have to die? Another rebellion! You have to admit that there was no point to the last half of this book. It didn't go anywhere. You will end this book with so many questions on why that happened. Roth spent 2 books creating a world that she effortlessly tore to shreds. She effortlessly dismissed the lives of her characters without cause or reason. And it is not even that Tris dies but its that she is shot by a man in a wheelchair after surviving the impossible. This effortlessness could be powerful but it goes nowhere. There is no purpose for her death no resolution that wouldn't have been achieved by her living except that the reader and Four are left brokenhearted.<br /><br />Read it because you know you have too but know you will be mad.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. It  tests my motor functions and keeps my fingers loose. You should really try this game it also helps with vision and mind.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's an addicting game that you can't stop playing its so addictive<br />U just have to play this game so so fun
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|As always, good insights, but slightly lacking in coherence. While his other books had one topic and detailed analysis, this is more of a mixed bag of thoughts and supporting stories. Still worth reading.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books they are amazing! I read the second book in two days abs can't wait to read the third
B002VHI8FE|5.0|the character development is first class and carries you along the story. a great start to a trilogy for any fiction fan
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, I dont get to play it as much these days but try to get a few levels in everytime I play
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great graphics great storyline great game definitely recommend for ppl who love hidden object and puzzle games. Takes some time to gather energy when u run low but it is all around a good free game with no glitches and no need to buy a full version
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really like this game the only problem I have is with the duck hunting part you can be super far off and it still says you hit it...
B009CFYRCG|5.0|Just like the Dude was the man for his time, this movie was the movie for the nineties. So brilliant, we should send a copy into outer space.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|These are a little small but, my son will love them he loves legos and minecraft they are for christmas though but, sure he will love them very cute!
B00G32VYDG|5.0|I like movies like this because they are entertaining and it was real funny.  The premise of the movie was unique and I can see either squeals from this movie or a TV series
B00EVW013E|1.0|Sorry folks........  This movie can be summed up with 3 words.......  Stupid,Borind and Dumb........  Like a prievious poster said \\"move along folks nothing to see here\\".......  Dont waste your time or money on this one........
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game because of all of the different animals.  I like to capture them and build their habitats.
B0098QBEXO|3.0|Spoiler Alert. As someone who works for a hospice, I have been present with the dying.  While the main character does not consider his death a suicide,I question it. Hence my rating.  The zeitgeist seems to be moving towards assisted suicide, but current medicine can control pain especially for the dying. If the movie were based on a true story, I wonder what impact James' death would have on his companions or his family, especially when they are faced with their own deaths.<br /><br />The movie seemed slow moving and I found myself checking how much longer.  The anger expressed by the main character was welcome relief. However his only resolution for his anger was to control the great inevitable.
B005N7CA3A|4.0|I was a HUGE Savage Garden fan, and ever since Darren went solo, he has constantly shown his amazing artistry and enormous talent for captivating lyrics and stirring melodies. His first effort, \\"Spin\\" had some really catchy tunes but I wasn't completely blown away. Then came the mercurial and techno-electronica, \\"The Tension and the Spark\\" and I was very impressed with many of the songs. Just when I thought that Darren may have quite possibly outdone himself, he releases \\"This Delicate Thing We've Made\\" and my jaw practically dropped from how much craftsmanship went into its construction. It's hard not to get swept away by some of the powerfully evocative ballads on that CD. And once again, with the brilliant, \\"Secret Codes & Battleships\\", Darren becomes such a skillful Architect to his own amazing vocal abilities and deft understanding of how visceral an experience listening to his songs can be. I could go on and on, but let me just say that I was giddy when I first heard \\"Roses\\", thinking how it could've been such an amazing \\"comeback\\" song for Savage Garden, but I digress. Including \\"Roses\\", my other favorite songs on this CD are, hands down, \\"Stupid Mistake\\", \\"Taken By the Sea\\", \\"Cruel, Cruel World\\",\\"Talk, Talk, Talk\\" and \\"Black Out the Sun\\". We can only imagine what Darren has up his sleeve next! And if it's anything close to what he's already graced his fans with, then we're all in for a seriously unforgettable treat!
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|...and today I learnt that the silo blast doors are being left open by crews....<br /><br />Great book, deeply researched and well written.
0544002318|4.0|It is always nice to read a good running story and it also have some great recepies too in it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Full disclosure: I adore Stephen King. That being said, I have not read all of his books because - and anyone who knows me will know this - I refuse to read stories about aliens. Give me ghosts, demons, vampires, and I'm especially partial to drunks (recovering or not) with special abilities. It stands to reason, then, that I was all about buying this book the day it came out and SLOWLY savoring every word. It did not disappoint,<br /><br />Many people call The Shining King's best. I'd put it in the top 5 ( with It, Carrie, Salem's Lot and The Stand). Doctor Sleep is the sequel to The Shining, and it does it proud. I wasn't sure what he was going to do with grown-up Danny Torrance, but what he did made perfect sense. As anyone who has personal knowledge of living with an alcoholic knows there are only two ways to go: drunk or not. Give that poor kid the history Danny had and the gift of shining on top, and it's not hard to see how he ends up where he does.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk much about the plot, but I will say that King earns even more points with me by naming one of his characters \\"Concetta\\" (and she goes by my name - Cetta - too, though she spells it with an H, which displeases me). And this band of evil people who travel by RV and steal children? Comes very close to the scary stories my mother told me about gypsies and is probably why to this day they scare the hell out of me.<br /><br />Anyway. Read the book. And be sad, like me, once you're done.
B004LUS390|5.0|Second time this app has been the free app of the day. It's a fine app for any artist. I suggest downloading the pdf user manual as this app expects an experienced user.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The large number display and ease of use is great for my aging eyes! I like that it also has the actual number equation you are seeking under the answer.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This is a great movie and it was very suspenseful. Jennifer Lawrence is awesome!  I can't wait until the second one comes out.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|I've had repeated hearings of his works including this one in Barnes and Nobles.  As with all of his work, his voice is always slightly<br />sharp and the vibrato within it makes me cringe.  I just don't find his voice complimentary to the music.  Still to this day I cannot understand his popularity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Five stars. I like e this game a lot.  It is easy for me,  I am 70 years young a a nd have vision problems.
006202406X|2.0|I would give 4 stars up until chapter 50 but then 1 star for the terrible ending, so averaged out to about 2 1/2 stars. Biggest let-down since [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]. I had been so looking forward to this book but the way Ms. Roth chose to end it made me want to hurl my copy across the room.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Addicted game, yet educational. Got it free, from free app, but it's worth .99 c. I recommend this game to everyone. Enjoy it!
B00BTV62KG|5.0|Scofield's second Uberjam offering is more than just a compilation of cuts that didn't make the first album, it stands on it's own with ( what I believe ) a funkier feel than the first album. Scofield's signature playing style is testament that his jazz roots can translate to other styles and influences, and in fact has made him one of those unique artists that can change with the times and still keep that unique Scofield sound. Also another feather in Scofield's cap is that his live performances are even better than the album. Saw him in West Orange, NJ a month ago and his band was smoking! If you dig his stuff and have him coming to your area I would implore you to get tickets and enjoy the show, he plays his ass off!
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed it and cannot wait for &#34;Catching Fire&#34; and &#34;Mockingjay&#34; to come out as movies.  I like the books and movies.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Wow! What a good album! Knew of Eliana from her Steps Ahead days with Mike Brecker, Eddie Gomez and Peter Erskine. Back then we all knew that she was a hell of a piano player but I never would have guessed that she had this in her. A few months ago I was in my car listening to WBGO ( the local Jazz station ) when I heard this wonderful version of 'There will never be another you'. I had phoned in to the station to find out whom the artist was since I missed the album credit information. I enjoyed this cut so much that I wanted to run out and purchase this CD, however it was a weekend, my call to the station fell into someone's voicemail that never returned my call, and I thought that I'd never find out whom the artist was. Several weeks later a friend that is also a jazz lover burnt me a copy of &#34;I thought About You' and said &#34; you'll love this, give it a listen&#34;. When I played the CD I quickly realized that this was the artist behind the 'There will never be Another You' rendition that I heard weeks ago on WBGO. After listening to the entire album it became apparent that the whole album was smoking, not a bad cut on it! I usually prefer edgier stuff especially with jazz, but even though this isn't my favorite genre it's become one of my favorite CDs. So much so that I bought another copy of the CD even though I had the burnt copy ( when an artist has an offering this good they deserve to make the royalties on the CD sale ). If you like jazz standards or the like of Diana Krall you'll love this CD. Way to go Eliane, I've put you on my radar for your next release.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|One of the best albums of all time.  Never gets stale, and to this day I can still listen to this album and just put it on repeat.
B001H4R4LQ|2.0|This book wasn't one of the best from the series.  It took a lot just to get through it.  Very slow.
0316067598|5.0|Riveting account of individual heroism, failing US policy and insight into the Afkan people.  A good book to learn about the intensity of Navy Seal traning and the few that are able to earn their Tridents.  Also a good resouce for understanding the tribal politics of Afganistan and their relationship with the Taliban.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed this medical mind's account of his journey to Heaven. He inspired me.  He says that God is Love. I believe that. Other parts of his account are strange to me. We'll see when we get to Heaven.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|What I appreciated was the lack bravado in telling a story that most people would probably embellish if they were part of such a historic moment.  I was surprised at actually how different the media reported certain events versus actually what took place.
B000W178XO|5.0|Wonderful album, enjoy all the songs on it. I highly recommend this to both fans of Johnny Cash and new listeners.
1401938906|5.0|This is a great book and explains the subject so clearly!  Thank you, dear Pam, for putting this together is such an easy to understand way.  I look forward to reading more of your books!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Wish there were more levels. My son and I have spent a few hours figuring them together.  Good quality time together.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Downloaded the game for my Kindle Fire HD, and I am having problems with the very first room. I can't seem to open up all clues on the dresser.  So I can only give this 2 star rating.
B00902MCVY|5.0|I own over 2000 albums ranging the gamut from Classical to Vocal, from Electronica to Black Metal, I pretty much love music.  I can easily say I would rank this album in my top 10 out of my entire collection.  This album deserves a good set of headphones for a good listen, there are many layers that take multiple listenings to discover, very few albums offer such depth.  The recording is superb, crystal clear, mixed perfectly and a good set of headphones really brings this out.  I listen though a set of Sennheiser HD650's.  I know not everyone wants to spend that much an cans but I am 99% of the time using headphones so a worthy investment for me, but listening to this album though iPhone ear-buds is a disgrace to this masterpiece of modern metal.  I'm not going to get into details about each song, since so many before have.  If you enjoy Scandinavian metal and the genera contained do yourself a favor and GET THIS ALBUM! and get some decent headphones to hear all the layers, I can akin it to going though life without the proper glasses, you don't know how much you're missing till you try it.<br /><br />If you are looking for entry level audiophile headphones I would recommend:<br /><br />Audio-Technica ATH-M30 - [[ASIN:B00007E7C8 Audio Technica ATH M30 Professional Closed back Headphones]]<br /><br />or<br /><br />Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones - [[ASIN:B000065BPB Sennheiser HD 280 Pro Headphones]]<br /><br />I tend to like Sennheiser's since they offer a more laid back sound and are 'easy' to listen to some headphones can get fatiguing after awhile and I don't find that with Sennheisers.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game, love the guns and hunting the animals. Can't wait to get farther and start hunting all th  more exotic animals.
B00ET47USI|4.0|Like playing this game.  Only wish it tracks your wins and loses.  Very challenging and fun to play.  Try it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was that kid who would flip to the back of the book and see if the main characters lived/stayed together, so it has only been natural that once I switched to a Kindle I would come on amazon and check the ratings.  When I saw that this book had a two star average I got concerned and of course skimmed the comments.  This did spoil the ending for me, but it also allowed me to read the last half of the book with a different attitude.  It took me two reads to finally like the last book of the Hunger Games series and I think this would have been the same had I not already knew what what coming.  I think that there have been so many series where we as readers get invested in the characters and have gotten the \\"happy\\" ending we were looking for.  This series was never about happy endings and so I believe that it ended exactly as it needed to.  Tris truly came full circle in her beliefs and growing as a person.  I feel like the ending allowed Tobias to continue his growth in a way that never would have happened otherwise.  Did I cry for the last hour of the book?  OF COURSE!!!  Just because a primary character died does not mean that it isn't a great read and conclusion of the series so for that I rate it 5 stars.  I also think Veronica Roth gave us 10 times more closure with this ending then I will ever feel the Hunger Games series gave me.  I would have much rather got an ending like this where I feel at peace with the characters than to spend time after reading the book feeling unresolved.  I will still continue recommending this series to my friends, with the disclaimer to grab their tissues for the last book :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I normally don't add reviews for books. but after seeing the average, even poor reviews, I needed to comment.  The final book in this series ebbs and flows around the story of injustice and war. Veronica Roth has the ability to have you see both sides of war and it's injustices, show  you how each side can defend it's beliefs, and make you understand that in the end,  everyone loses.  I cried for at least an hour AFTER I finished the book, and to be truthful, I am crying while I'm writing this review.<br />I believe that the reason why this book has so many average reviews is that those people felt as upset and empty as I did after finishing the book...but that is what LIFE is about - love, loss, and the daily decision to be the person you want to be - and sometimes you have to fight for what you believe in.<br />Veronica Roth - thank you for telling this story.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|My only complaint is that I finished it!  More of the surprises and great storytelling that I love about the series.  I don't know how long I'll be able to resist buying Book Five.  This book does focus on a portion of the characters and he finishes by explaining that he split what would have been a huge volume into two books.  So Book Five will cover the stories of the rest of the characters.  Although I missed those characters, I was not at all disappointed with the story told in Book Four.  I strongly recommend this for anyone who has enjoyed the first three.
B00DPY95D6|2.0|Not thrilled with the story line, nor the pacing, nor the outcome (I skipped to the end to find out how it ended).
1465414444|5.0|I pre-ordered this book because I'm a WoW fan and active player.  It didn't hurt that the price was discounted for the pre-order!  But, once I had the book in my hands, I was very happy with my purchase and would have gladly paid the full price for it.  This will be on display in my living room and I'm having a lot of fun just looking through the images and reading everything.  I love lore and I'm learning bits that I never knew.  Love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Some of the levels r hard but it's the best game ever!!!!! I wish that u almost didn't have to pay for cheats but if your patient u can do it!!!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it works great I use everyday, and its free, I'm so glad its free. the creators of this app should know that I do not plan on paying for it at all.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|I really, really enjoyed The White Queen.  And what impressed me the most is how historically accurate this production was in the most part, save some minor things.  Sure, people who are anal about historical detail may complain that there were no zippers and drain pipes in 15th century England, as apparently UK viewers did.  But I tend to be more forgiving as long as they get the history right.  The story of these three women (Elizabeth Woodville, Anne Neville and Margaret Beaufort)and their schemes is so compelling that it makes for great TeeVee drama.  I also enjoyed some of the subplots,  including that Elizabeth's mother, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, believed herself to be descended from the water goddess Melusina. I enjoyed the witchcraft subplot and if you read some of the historical accounts, witchcraft is a constant theme.  I assure you that after you are done watching this, you will want to research more on your own about the period known as The War of the Roses.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Some of King's books are absolutely OUTSTANDING, and some are a little too far out for me.  This was a good mix.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0385351399|2.0|I don't think I'm giving away anything when I say that this novel has the interesting premise that total internet visibility and connectivity = totalitarianism, a premise I more or less agree with. Which predisposes me to like THE CIRCLE. Alas, the premise, like the Marianas trench shark who shows up near the end of the novel, devours all the usual nourishment fiction provides, leaving the ashy residue of a predictable plot (I had figured out the big reveal about a quarter of the way into the book), characters so two-dimensional that even the main character is more like an avatar than an actual person, and language drained of sensory detail. But it gets the glossy unrelentingly demanding details of Silicon Valley corporate culture right.<br /><br />The most fun I had was trying to figure out which actual Silicon Valley tycoons were represented by the Three Wise Men who run The Circle. Was Larry Ellison the model for villainous Tom Stenton? Is mysterious Ty a combination of Sergey Brin and Bill Joy?  Is slogan-spouting good guy Eamon Bailey a stand-in for Eric Schmidt? I'll never know unless Dave Eggers breaks the novelist's code of \\"all my characters are entirely fictional\\" and tells.<br /><br />Probably any novel whose main concern is our electronic culture is bound to be thinned out by its topic (see SUPER SAD TRUE LOVE STORY for example), but because I mostly agree with THE CIRCLE's gloomy vision of people whose thinking abilities are destroyed by the combination of electronic distraction and corporate power, I wish it had done a better job of creating a world dense enough for me to either be surprised by it or care about it, as Jonathan Lethem managed to do in CHRONIC CITY, his novel about internet culture run amok.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can finally play on my kindle. Love the game, its a great way to kill time and now I can take it with me.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the previous two. The situations and problems felt recycled. It got tedious. Also, the situation with the cities didn't feel resolved even though it was implied in the epilogue.<br /><br />I didn't care for two POVs. I don't mind it generally but in this case, I would go to the next chapter and read for a while and I only realized the POV switched when I saw the name \\"Tobias\\" or \\"Tris\\" during the middle of it instead of \\"I\\" or when mentions of Caleb (indicated Tris) or Evelyn/Marcus (Tobias). It should be so obvious, right? Well, the POVs change after like 1-3 chapters and the tone of the chapters were incredibly similar. I found it sort of tedious and I would usually go back and skim the chapter again.<br /><br />I still enjoyed their interactions. Not in a ooh-finally-romance!kind of way. They find life within one another and Tris is still unsure and shy in her approach to him sometimes. She still stands up to him. Not too many cheesy sessions. I'm glad the author didn't push it with the physical contact. Their relationship is sort of tested in this, as it was towards the end of the second book. I don't feel like they addressed it much. Anyway, I really don't like reading romance between teenagers (I'm not that old, I swear!) but I really like the two characters. They are strong characters forced to grow up under hard conditions.<br /><br />I don't feel like the supporting characters have as significant roles here. Probably because so many new ones were introduced.<br /><br />Allegiant tries to cover a lot.... all the problems and conflicts that arisen in the first two books. I don't know how successful it was.<br /><br />************************<br />************************<br /><br />*******SPOILERY*********<br /><br />(I'm going to jump around a lot - I just finished the book and am just spilling thoughts here)<br /><br />Ok, I pretty much saw the fate of Tris happening already at the end. Don't like it much but I can accept it.<br /><br />How she died was really unremarkable in the face of everything. And like, OKAY, Tobias and Tris shouldn't be remarkable exceptions to all the destruction and deaths that have befallen their city and friends but STILL, if the author was going for realism, there were plenty of opportunities for such earlier. And really, all they have survived in the other books really lead me to believe there was a pinprick of light at the end of all of this. I really felt like she just died just to make everything more drastic for Tobias at the end... and to give Caleb one hell of a guilt trip for the rest of his life (JK!) I think what also sucks is that Tobias was nowhere near her when she died... which would only make it so painful for him but I think would also bring him closure in knowing exactly how she died. I don't know... I just felt like they should have been together in the end. It was hard reading his reaction when he found out about her from someone else.<br /><br />They had so many drastic plans (to change things, to get rid of people, to overthrow things). I was surprised they didn't talk it out a bit or the fact that no one contested. It's like they all agreed readily to the first thing anyone blurts out.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the plot. Yay, they sort of find out what's outside. It's another society, focused on genetic engineering. Oh wait, there's something corrupt here so let's overthrow that. And it's not JUST this Bureau, is it? Wasn't there more? What did overthrowing that one building do??? What did Tris die for? In all honesty, I tried to reread but ended up skimming all the talk about the genetically damaged and the genetically pure. I can't really tell you who started what and who tried to fix that.<br /><br />Natalie Prior was so mysterious but we get to find out about her in unfulfilling tidbits. I really wished she lived a bit longer.<br /><br />Oh, and there was so much buildup about the message of Tris' ancestor from the cliffhanger of the 2nd book, too. HARDLY worth the buildup. This was addressed by the character(s) just realizing that a lot of things were lies.<br /><br />***********************<br /><br />I thought 2 stars was fair for how I felt after reading this.e cliffhanger of the 2nd book, too. HARDLY worth the buildup. This was addressed by the character(s) just realizing that a lot of things were lies.<br /><br />***********************<br /><br />I thought 2 stars was fair for how I felt after reading this.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I find this rather boring.  One of my major problems is that if you take a second to think about your move, it highlights an area where you can move.  Doesn't leave lots to think about.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|All I can say is the more I read the more I kept waiting for this book to get better, then realized I was almost finished only to discover the worst ending ever! I liked the first two books, but the third was a big disappointment. Usually the end of a trilogy the characters get deeper and the story gets better, not the case here.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book, I read the entire trilogy and it wasn't the best<br />ending book for the trilogy but it will suffice
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|After watching \\"Blackfish\\" which I admittedly cried in parts, I am so ashamed of Sea World.  I visited Sea World several times as a child into adulthood, and I feel sick knowing that Sea World has pushed so many lies on to the public.  I now see Sea World as liars, manipulators, thieves (of the sea) and murderers.  I will never visit Sea World again thanks to this completely eye-opening documentary unless they CHANGE THEIR AWFUL WAYS!  It must end, it just has to.  I feel sorry that I ever gave this place my money.  These poor whales, ripped from their families (the originals like Tilikum) are not ours to \\"entertain us\\".  They weren't meant to live their lives in a tiny space, waving to humans for a cheap thrill.  They are majestic creatures who need room to roam and live out their natural lives as they were meant to.<br /><br />Please watch this film.  You won't be disappointed.  It's filled with so many interviews of Orca researchers and actual former Sea World trainers.  It has amazing footage.  Please watch this film and consider supporting wild animals/mammals staying in their natural habitat.  It's wrong to mess with them.  We just need to leave them alone.

B00DLKXF3A|5.0|What can I say about this album that it has not been said. I'm not a fan of this band at all but I took a listen anyway, I was surprised how good the sound quality is, the drums are mixed up front that gives the music a very heavy feel, I love how this sounds in my car.<br />About the music? well everybody says is a rip off of classic bands...who cares? I don't those are the bands I grew up listening and AX7 reminds me how good this era was. They keep metal alive and that is enough for me.<br />Go get this CD, is far way better than any other album out there...
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I think that the worst part of the book was when tris died . I  mean how do u kill off the main character. Tobias and tris were suppose to live a happy ever after

B00CSSS2V6|5.0|Best concert record!!! Paul's energy is amazing. His voice is at its peak!  To me it really shows Wings was the next chapter after the Beatles.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Investigative journalism is a dying art.  There are few media outlets that can support the months of labor necessary for a well grounded investigative piece.  The history of the cold war is well served by the six year effort of Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation.  This is a measured, dispassionate, well written story of the true level of danger associated with the first three decades of the nuclear arms race.  An eye opener for civilians and a reminder to veterans of the unheralded courage demonstrated by many uniformed members during the Cold War.  Highly recommended to general readers as well as those interested in military history of the period.
B005MW5CWW|4.0|I'm not a deep Mastodon listener, but I greatly respect their talent.  This album has engaging melodies and riffs, technical wizardry and hearty vocals.  Curl of the Burl is a prog/metal chartable jam that will get stuck in your head.  I appreciate that throughout this album they rarely repeat themselves. That's got to be easier said than done.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'm not going to say anything specific about the book itself so I won't spoil anything, but it definitely left me dissapointed...If any of you have read the entire Hunger Games Trilogy, the same thing happens with this one: the first book (Divergent) is spectacular, the second book (Insurgent) is good but a little repetitive, and the third book (Allegiant) goes in a downward spiral of GIGANTIC plot holes, repetitiveness again and an ending that just quite doesn't fit the rest of the books...<br /><br />I seriously don't know why authors lately have to extend a story that is great just for the purpose of...I don't know...money? fame? The Divergent story in itself was excellent, Veronica Roth could have filled in all the plot holes in this last book but decided to go a whole different way, which in my opinion was not the best...but well, if you're reading this review, at least the book is entertaining and maybe you'll differently...so enjoy!!
B004K583KA|5.0|Finally I got the right one.  This set of Bach Chorales is superb.  Didn't realize the packet was so immense - 71 CDs and 2 booklets and 1 CD-Rom !.  The sound is excellent and the version with Helmut Rilling is the best.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|Listened to this new release from Katy a few times through.  Gotta say one of the best Albums I've heard in a long time from beginning to end.  Great writing, fun tunes - really not a bad one that I needed to skip past.  Watched a couple of the recent Late Show appearances and really like her attitude and effort put into this.  Kids love the single tracks so far and I am sure they will enjoy the full album.  Can't imagine we won't have a couple more No. 1's off this release.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first and second books of the Divergent series were good and I should have stopped after the second book and drawn my own conslusions as to how the entire series would end because Allegiant was a terrible third book!  Poorly crafted as well.  Sometimes in the midle of chapter, it was hard to tell who was narrating.  Same old boring, repetitive I love you/I hate you from Tris and Four and (SPOILER) killing her off was a terrible end to this trilogy!  Or, at the very least (SPOILER) killing her off in place of her brother was ridiculous!  I mean really, how many times did the author and Tris tell us how stupid she was for putting herself in danger time and again and how she wouldn't do it this time because of how in love she was, and then goes and gets herself killed in her brother's stead?  I want my money back!  Definitely will not subject myself to the movies with an ending such as this!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|There seemed to be something in the movie for the whole family: inventiveness, laughter, cuteness, unexpected outcomes, funny accents.  We really enjoy the extras added in, too.  We like to see the actors that use their voices.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. I like all three separate yet intertwining lives and stories. I could hardly put the book down.  I loved the flashback chapters as well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great writing and acting. Many interesting story lines and characthers to root/despise. If you like politics, romance,intrigue and a glimpse inside a lawyers thought process, this is the drama for you.

B002MFULQO|5.0|For such heavy subject matter this film moves right along at a great pace and you hardly feel the extreme length. The cast of characters is strong, the performances are solid, and it will really make you wonder what really happened back in November 1963. The only thing that bugged me were Joe Pesci's fake eyebrows... I've seen better in school productions. Maybe it was the HD, but they look awful and distracting in every scene.
1451624468|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading A Universe From Nothing, and found it to be scientifically clear and very well written --  but in my view the book glossed over too quickly the profound philosophical implications of modern cosmology.  The afterward by Richard Dawkins suffered the same shortcoming.<br /><br />The book prompted me to watch Krauss' Sept. 11, 2011 talk posted on Youtube that briefly summarized the key ideas.  Krauss' side-comments during the talk, as well as the introduction by Richard Dawkins, again declared in which philosophical camp they wished to pitch their tent.  But I worry that the elegant scientific concepts summarized do not so clearly lead to that depressing existential position.  Krauss jokingly shared his view of the human situation near the start of his talk when he remarked that he had considered using the title, We Are All Fu..ed!  Humorous, but is it true?<br /><br />The eminent philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) was a bit more poetic in his choice of language as he wrote in 1903 of humanity's desperate situation (I quote from a rendition published by Augros and Stanciu in The New Story of Science (1984), an interesting book but one with major flaws of its own):<br /><br />\\"That man is the product of causes which had no provision of the end they were achieving; that his origins, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and beliefs are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion ... all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction ... all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand.  Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built.\\"<br /><br />In sum, in his book Krauss wonderfully recounts in an approachable style the key concepts of modern cosmology, but falls with rather startling self-certainty into the depressing philosophical notions voiced by Russell more than a century ago.  Krauss was a bit more flexible in his Youtube talk when for one brief moment he showed one slide and remarked about the element of mystery in all this.  But he radically undervalues this element.  As I will explain, mystery is fundamental in view of a necessary first logical but unprovable step required in all complex arguments.<br /><br />In spite of the keen desire by Krauss and Dawkins to be, I presume, purely rational scientists untainted by wishful thinking, these sorts of truly strong scientific intellectuals must recognize that any argument must begin with one or a few key unproven assumptions --  this is unavoidable.  As has been elegantly proven by Kurt Gödel (1906-1978), no complex system of thought, even formal mathematics, can be built up from scratch and be internally fully consistent without resort to at least one external assumption or definition that cannot be definitively proven within that complex system.  This is Gödel's water-tight \\"incompleteness theorem\\" (1931), and its surprising truth has to do with the contradictions necessarily encountered regarding self-referential sets.  Descartes (1596-1650), for example, in his Discourse on the Methods (1637) began with the fundamental proposition, \\"I think, therefore I am.\\"  When considering the modern \\"Theory of Mind,\\" to cite another example, one could propose that a human person is in reality just an isolated brain floating in an oxygenated physiologic solution in a vast alien experiment, and all mental experiences, sensations, interactions with other persons, etc. result from a gigantic simulation --- other persons actually have no minds at all.  Alternatively, even though we cannot prove that other persons exist and have independent minds, we can reasonably assume that that is truly the case, and move ahead from there as we try to grasp \\"reality.\\"<br /><br />Coming to unavoidable unprovable assumptions related to cosmology, which sorts of assumptions make most sense?  In science we often resort to Occam's razor -- the principle of parsimony:  an explanation should be as simple as possible until a somewhat more complex explanation is actually required to fit with the facts.  Krauss along with modern cosmologists seem to find that all the mass and energy in the universe apparently sum to zero, and the argument is convincing and, I think, probably true.  And he also invokes a sort of anthropic principle: that humans exist because in this present universe, as opposed to many other unfavorable universes, the natural laws crystalized in forms that made human beings physically possible.  But is this parsimonious?  There certainly is a heavy burden of \\"specialness\\" if one believes that there has been only a single universe, this is it, and it is exactly perfect so that intelligent beings can exist and evolve.  But there may be arguably an even more heavy burden to the alternative view favored by Krauss;  that there are billions of parallel universes --  the \\"multi-verse\\" --- or perhaps billions of sequential universes.  Krauss thinks that in nearly all of these many universes the conditions were not right for sentient beings, but in at least one very rare case, a universe came into existence that made life possible.  So has there been only one universe that is unique and special, or have there been billions of random universes?  My belief is that, at the present time, reasonable persons have no basis by which to settle definitively which of these assumptions is the closest to the truth.  Moreover, my intuition is that it is precisely this question that is the crux of the fundamental unprovable assumption that we must make when thinking about the ultimate meaning of life --  or lack thereof.  In view of Gödel, it is fully scientific and allowed for each person to consider and to make this choice of a key starting assumption, and then thereafter one must logically develop a consistent world view based on observed facts.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I believe that Krauss and Dawkins should carefully think about this.  Gödel is the key.<br /><br />A particular aspect of Krauss' argument bothers me, however.  The billions of universes are supposedly arising from nothing, and actually are nothing since in each universe the total mass and energy sums to zero.  But Krauss invokes that this is possible because within quantum nothingness there are virtual particles that are rapidly entering and exiting existence.  But if there is truly nothing, then how do the newly formed virtual particles \\"know\\" what characteristics to briefly assume?  Must there not be \\"laws\\" to guide them?  In other words, it appears that there may be \\"several types of nothing\\" --  one type is seething with virtual particles of certain types that are rapidly appearing and disappearing, but I am interested really in another type of nothing --  absolutely nothing, lacking even in the virtual particles.  Can there be different types of nothing?  This calls to mind the work of the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918), the expert in set theory, who proved that there were different types of infinity.  He showed, for example, that the real numbers are \\"more numerous\\" than the natural numbers, even though both are infinite.<br /><br />Thus, my view, in agreement with Arthur Stanley Eddington's (1882-1944) famous essay The Decline of Determinism (1935), is that we do not live in a \\"billiard ball\\" deterministic universe.  Quantum mechanics allows for indeterminism, and also, in my view, free will.  I tried to make such a case in my brief essay The Inherent Uncertainty of Nature Is a Basis for Religion published in The Scientist in December, 1988.  Various influences that shaped my thinking have been described in a book, Chess Juggler (2011).  I'll admit to being influenced over the years also by the profound insights of the philosopher Mortimer Adler (1902-2001) --  one of his many books was How to Think About God (1980).  Even Isaac Newton (1642-1727) reflected philosophically in his Opticks (1704) that he wanted to learn \\"Whence it is that Nature doth nothing in vain; and whence arises all that Order and Beauty which we see in the World.\\"  Let me close with what the naturalist and anthropologist Loren Eiseley (1907-1977) wrote in The Immense Journey, \\"Rather, I would say that if `dead' matter has reared up this curious landscape of fiddling crickets, song sparrows, and wondering men, it must be plain to even the most devoted materialist that the matter of which he speaks contains amazing, if not dreadful powers, and may not impossibly be, as Hardy has suggested, `But one mask of many worn by the Great Face behind.'\\"

6305291446|3.0|\\"Halloween H20\\" is a fun entry into the series, and goes a long way in making Michael scary again. Over the previous 3 sequels, Michael lost his stalking menace, and where \\"Halloween\\" kind of laid out the blueprint for slasher films like \\"Friday the 13th\\" to follow, \\"Halloween 4, 5, & 6\\" seems to throw what made the original such a classic and began copying the imitators the original story spawned. Michael became more like a Jason Voorhees type killer (which isn't a bad thing), but lost what made him so original.<br /><br />As \\"H20\\" opens we meet Dr. Loomis' old nurse last seen in \\"Halloween II\\". She arrives home one evening to find someone has broken into her home and searched through some old files Dr. Loomis kept regarding Laurie Strode. We soon learn that Laurie faked her death hoping to escape from Michael and has moved to California...and that Michael now knows this as well.<br /><br />Laurie Strode, now living under an alias, and working as a headmistress of a private school is trying to piece together a normal life. With a 17-year old son, she is beginning to unravel as Halloween approaches. She's seeing her murderous brother in mirrors, and through windows and is convinced Michael is coming back for her. Her son and his friends decide to have a Halloween bash on school grounds when most of the students will be leaving for a camping trip. Hiding away from his mom and the security guard, the foursome soon light every candle available, and proceed to party like it's 1999...(er..1998?). It's not long before Uncle Mike shows up and the blood begins to flow.<br /><br />\\"H20\\" does a really good job of building suspense, much like the first two films in this series. If you're looking for a high body cound, this isn't the entry for you. Like the original film, the scares are all about the build and Michael's appearance towards the end of the film.<br /><br />If you are hoping to learn more about the Thorn cult, Jamie's baby or any of the elements featured in the previous three sequels, forget it. This is the 3rd time they decided to hit the re-set button on this series and there is no reference to the events of the previous three films.....which is kind of a good thing.<br /><br />\\"H20\\" has some really good perfomances, and the cast consists of known actors unlike the previous films. I really liked that Janet Leigh get a prolonged cameo, and the references to [[ASIN:B000ICXQXI Psycho (1960)]] are scattered throughout the film.<br /><br />The big issue I had with \\"H20\\" is that by relocating the series to California, we lose that Halloween season vibe. No trick or treaters or jack-o-latern's on porches. This film could be taking place in April or June, and I miss Haddonfield.<br /><br />Definately worth a rental, even if you checked out of this series after part 2, this was a really good attempt to get the series back on track.vious three sequels, forget it.

0316172324|3.0|this book was highly recommended to me by many people.  I enjoyed it but it wasn't as inspiring as I had it built up to be in my mind.  It was a little repetitive.  It had great parts but I didn't need to read the whole book to understand the concept.
B0085Z3AMW|1.0|I love horror movies, love 'em. Horror is my favorite genre, and I have a particular love for 80's slasher flicks. I grew up on these films, and drop everything, even today, when a new entry in either the \\"Halloween\\", \\"Friday the 13th\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" or \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" series comes out. I love 'em, and can usually find something to enjoy even in the weakest entries.<br /><br />With that said, I HATE this movie. Even sticking within the movie's logic, Halloween 5 is a dumb movie that insults fans of the series and anyone watching this film.<br /><br />Taking up one year after the events of the previous film, we learn that Michael escpaed the raging rednecks by sneaking out of a hole in the back of the mine he was blown into. He scootches out into a river and rides the rapids downstream to an old hermit's shanty. The old hermit, who obviously hasn't heard about the raging maniac stalking Haddonfield, decides to keep a horribly wounded masked man in his shack instead of calling the police or taking him for medical assistance??!?! One year goes by and Michael awakens, and the killing spree begins.<br /><br />We learn that Jamie is in a children's clinic and has been rendered mute due to the events of the last film. Rachel makes what amounts to an extended cameo, and seems to have moved along quite nicely from the horrific events of the previous year. She's made annoying new friends, and dear god are they annoying, and she's planning on hosting a Halloween bash at her house with her folks being out of town.<br /><br />We also learn that Jamie now has a psychic connection to Michael...um, okay? And we also see that a mysterious Man in Black has arrived in Haddonfield. Why, who is he? We won't know for another film, so just disregard his presence. Dr. Loomis seems to know that Michael is coming back, and tries to prepare everyone...again, but before long Michael is back slashing his way through party goers and goofy deputies.<br /><br />This movie misfires on almost all counts; saddling us with Rachel's annoying friends, adding way too much plot and motive for Michael, and giving Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris so little to work with.

B00027JYLC|5.0|Tod Browning's \\"Freaks\\" is a must see movie. It usually shows up on TV around Halloween, but every time I watch it, I ponder whether this movie should be considered a horror film.<br /><br />There are definately horrific elements here, the but it's not what you think upon first glance. How many times have you watched a horror film and felt that the wrong character was being portrayed as a \\"monster\\"? Think of [[ASIN:B002RXZF6C Frankenstein (1931)]], through the ages it's Karloff's lumbering creature that is played for chills, but when you watch the film, and the superior sequel[[ASIN:B000ID37KY The Bride of Frankenstein]], you realize the real \\"monster\\" is the doctor, not his creation. Yet it's the monster that pays the price, hunted and murdered by a mob of towns people.<br /><br />If you watch a bunch of creature features, it's always those who fall outside the norm that are portrayed as \\"monsters\\", even if there is no bad or evil intent. Whether it's [[ASIN:B0091XICM0 King Kong (1933) [HD]]], [[ASIN:B004SOUB44 The Hunchback of Notre Dame]] or [[ASIN:B005EYGRQI It Came from Outer Space]], you feel badly for how these characters are treated, and you wish they would strike back at the people out to persecute them.<br /><br />Well with \\"Freaks\\" you get your wish. We see that the real freaks in this film are the \\"pretty\\" people who manipulate and use those around them. They have no loyalty, morals or faith. They scheme for money, for pleasure and plot murder, while the titular Freaks are shown to be caring, loving people who may be deformed in body, but not in spirit. We also are told that to offend one is to offend all, and that lesson is driven home in last 10-15 minutes of the movie. But it's not scary, riveting for sure, but not scary. You are hoping that this thrown together family will make things \\"right\\" for the attack done to one of their members.<br /><br />A great film, and one that will stick with you for quite a while after it's over.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A little slow but in the end it was a great book. It even made me cry. A hear touching book.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Honestly, I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said about \\"Halloween\\"? While [[ASIN:B000FS9FE4 The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (2-Disc Ultimate Edition)]] kind of kick-started the 70's horror genre and [[ASIN:B000IMUYJM Black Christmas (Special Edition)]] gave us the first modern \\"slasher\\" movie, it was \\"Halloween\\" that took the form and made it popular.<br /><br />\\"Halloween\\" is a simple story, which is why it's so effective. A lunatic who murdered his sister escapes from the mental institution and makes his way back to his hometown to continue his killing spree. Unfortunately a couple of babysitters and their boyfriends become his chosen targets. We aren't introduced to motive (remember it's not until the sequel that we learn there even is a motive of why Michael is after Laurie), there's no rationale behind the masked figure's attacks. It's a straight forward tale that could've been boring, and tedious if not for:<br />1. - Michael's mask. Whoever created this thing deserves to make big bank. Yes, it's just Kirk turned inside out, but it is sooooo effective.<br />2. - The cast, Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are tremendous and give it their all. They may be starring in a small B-movie, but they leave it all on the screen, and carry the film.<br />3. - Carpenter's direction. Taking a page out of Alfred Hitchcock's playbook, Carpenter allows the tension to build and build, and when the payoff comes in last third of the film, it pays off big time.<br />4. - The music. I don't know if \\"Halloween\\" would've captured an audience without the chilling theme song and score. The music is chilling and shrill and scary in and of itself. Without Carpenter's score, this film just wouldn't pack the same punch.<br /><br />I'm sure you've seen this film, it's been played so often, and has been held up as the perfect horror film. It launched the slasher craze of the 1980's, with 7 sequels and a re-boot with it's own sequel it would be hard to have missed this one. If it's been awhile since you've seen it, do yourself a favor and give it another view. It holds up really well, and it's the perfect way to kick off your Halloween season.e.

B0000630W0|5.0|I loved it especially the instrumental first track and with David Gilmour on guitar it made it even that much better.
B00ELE8D4Q|2.0|Cher, ARRP called. If you want that Denny's discount for Moons Over My Hammy, you need to stop with the disco diva BS.<br /><br />I've followed Cher since the dawn of time. I saw both &#34;Chastity&#34; and &#34;Good Times&#34; at the drive in on their first releases. I watched the TV show, both versions (married and divorced). Yes, I'm old. And gay. I love a great diva, which Cher is, and has been for a long time. Unfortunately, this new album is well, um, just not good. There, I said it. She's never going to be handed another song like &#34;Believe&#34;, which reignited her fading career. This new album is elevator music for club kids and youngblood gays who really never saw Cher in her heyday. All the songs are auto tuned to death. They all sound alike. They all want to be &#34;Believe 2.0&#34;, but you can't catch lightning in a bottle twice. Cher may perhaps have one final chance before the curtain falls, but this sad collection of disco reject songs aren't it. Someone help her before the plastic surgery and botox prevent anything other than sign language from an American icon. This new collection of songs are bottom of the barrel when compared to her earlier work. Sad Cher.

If you like upbeat fast pace metal fused with their old style you will love this album. I will have to admit that this album is kick a**.  KoRn fan 4 life.

B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Richard's career is well documented and extraordinary.  This collection of songs reflects the vitality in his singing, song writing, and guitar playing.  No RT CD can capture the experience of hearing RT live, but this album comes close.  It gets stronger with each listening.

B0054YHB36|5.0|This is my favorite album by Mariah. Daydream has to be the second because it is so well put together and then Emotions and well let's just talk about this album and the seller. I recieved this the same time as the Emotions album in mint condition and I love Mariah so as long as the CD came in the case and it played I would be satisfied.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Who would know that a while back, people thought sort of like us. This is the same stuff I read about today only, this is from before 2000. This book was amazing, I would recommend it to reluctant readers. Also, I will be seeing the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love it. Can't wait for the next season. This is one show that you can really connect with the characters
B00915G6MG|5.0|There's a reason this show has made it to its 10th season. I'm not a tv watcher, but I got hooked on it and we bought every single season. The cast of characters are not-quite-grown-up young adults, but one keeps hoping they will finally make it. In the mean time, the plots are interesting.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|love playing this game, got introduced through my iphone.  Have played it so much and I got my progress up.  Now, when I play on my kindle fire, I have to start all over again, which is pretty boring once you've managed to go through all the obstacles in the higher numbers.  I wish I could sync my kindle app to my iphone.  Or is there a way that I haven't found yet?
B001DJLCRC|1.0|It has subtitles in other languages, but not in English.  That makes it a waste of money, especially considering the editing out of curse words and partial nudity for the disks available on Amazon.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I have always felt its the kindle, but a new cable sent isn't fixing the problem. I plug it in and it seems when or if contact does happen, it doesn't last. I am very disappointed. I was just getting comfortable with my kindle.

B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Great Movie and timeless.  Have seen it many times and never tire of it.  One of Tom Hanks best films.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the first two books, Insurgent and Divergent, but this one was so depressing. I think that if you read the first two you shouldn't read this one, because it is so depressing it just might ruin the other books for you.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|When a remake hits the theater I like to see the original before seeing the newer version.<br />Comparing the cinematography, the sets, costumes, etc. makes it interesting.<br />Treatment of the story line is always amusing.<br />With Carrie I am interested in the opening sequences, who is cast in the lead roles, the vehicles and of course what changes are made in demonstrating Carrie's powers.<br />This was a quick film with a few lulls.<br />Interesting fact is this was King's first published novel and he made very little relatively speaking when the rights were sold.<br />As a cultural icon and for previewing the remake this is well worth seeing.
006202406X|4.0|I'm doing my best to write this without spoilers so as not to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it!<br /><br />Wow. Wow. Wow. This really threw me for a loop. I love this series and most especially the amazing leading characters Roth developed. By the time you get to Allegiant, you are embedded in who Tris is, her strengths, her flaws and the raw way she views and reacts to the world around her. But, until now you really only know Tobias from how he is painted by Tris (beyond a few excerpts Roth provided outside of the first two books) and Allegiant gives you the opportunity to turn the tide and see the world, Tris, and Tobias himself through his eyes.<br /><br />To be honest, the first half of the book felt a little choppy for me. It was a little hard to distinquish between the voices of Tris and Tobias and I found myself checking back to the beginning of the chapter often to see who's perspective I was in. As things progressed and the story lead them down different paths it became easier, but I was not prepared for the blow that came in the end. I am devastated as a fan and as someone who has fallen in love with these characters, but I also understand the path Roth chose. As much as anyone I wanted and believed in the happy ending, but in many ways I appreciate the raw and tragic way Roth wrapped up the story. It is beyond heartbreaking, but it also intensifies my connection as a reader with a main character that has, until now, been an integral part of the journey but also understood only at surface level. Right now I feel like I am mourning the loss of one character as if they were a part of my immediate family, but I have also gained this very rare compassion for and understanding of another that I didn't think was possible.<br /><br />My hat is off to you, Roth. Although it wasn't perfect, you definitely succeeded in creating two characters that I won't soon forget.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Like the puzzles it's challenging and a little frustrating at times to figure out what to do next. Like the graphics.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This work fills some gaps about the life of Jesus.  It is important to note however, that the author focuses mainly on the historical Jesus with some connections to Jesus as the Son of Man.  In our Christian walk we must clearly understand that our religious beliefs are based on historical events and teachings TAKEN IN CONTEXT of who they were directed to, AND our FAITH in Jesus Christ as the only Son of God the Father.  Neither belief in God or history as we have it will get us to a full understanding of who we are as people of faith until we reach our eternal reward.  It is best to remember that BIBLE means Basic Information Before Leaving Earth!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This was an informative tale, well written.  It filled in much of history that I probably would never looked up on my own.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I always said I would not gbet hooked on any of the tablet/pc games. I thought it was a ridiculous waste of time and technology. Ohhhh but how hooked I became (I'm now working my way through 266 I think). It's a pretty unique combination of skill and chance, that somehow just sucks you in. And you probably have enough friends playing if you connect the account with your Facebook account that you can always get extra moves, extra lives, etc. to allow you to keep playing after you run out of lives. I also toggle between my phone, my PC and my tablet. I can get 15 lives per &#34;set&#34; that way :-).<br /><br />I do wish they would allow you to make a one-time purchase of lives that would last for an indefinite period of time, or allow you to start with more than 5 lives if you haven't played for more than a  few hours. But they're out to make money, so it probably won't happen.
B004UO4AYE|5.0|My mother said that her parents spoke German when they did not want the children to understand what they were saying!  My mom taught me some German and I have learned a bit on my own. I think these free Kindle books are excellent tools to study a foreign language and you can not beat the price!
B004LUS390|5.0|This is great for creating quick on the spot free form flowcharts and notes for work (I actually use this instead of notepad). Since this was a free app purchase in Amazon (and I go a $1 promo credit for it for and mp3), I'd give this 6 stars if I were able ;-)
0307010856|4.0|This is a fun book from yesteryear.  Its quite possible that I might like the book more than the kids do, but whatever.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|Came undamaged and works perfectly. My Mother has found it enjoyable. We've both loved this movie for quite a long time, and seen it more times than we can count, but it still has been watched often since I bought it. This is one of my all-time favorite films. If you've not seen it you're missing out!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Fantastic!!! I think probably the best CD Sir Paul has released in some time.  Every song is really good and the music is great from start to finish.  Must buy!!!
B005TBN3EU|2.0|It's got some high points but it definitely fails to meet the level of fun the first movie had. Just trying to go over the top too much
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Once again Hans Zimmer does his magic!! Of course it is rare if he produces something that is bad.  Great Soundtrack!
B006AN78XS|5.0|Wow, that has to now be my favorite Woody Allen movie of ALL time!  Everything about it was amazing, seriously.  Wow...Can't think of the perfect words to describe it.  It would be a shame not to watch it.  You definitely should.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Incredibly well written period-drama with perfect casting, historical accuracy, and appropriately paradigm-breaking themes and events.  It is a wonderful look into early, rural 20th century England.  Start at the first season and enjoy the ride all the way through.  Way to go PBS!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a great game I love it! I'm so happy that Candy Crush Saga came to the Kindle. It's about time!!!!
0143122916|3.0|Quickly read. It's a short book for a story that has so much details to deliver. 20+ years in the life of a man in a prison camp and his escape from NK summarised in 200pages. The escape and run to china is only 5 chapters out of 23...However, it gives a good insight of what life is in those prison camps and so it's still worth having a read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, it is very addictive, i think its the most popular game on facebook as everyone seems to play it. Would pass it on to all my friends and family.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I hate giving games a one for them not downloading but that is the only reason it gets a 1 because I didn't get to play it yet now its stuck in my cloud.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|It started out great then it stopped working! I deleted it and downloaded again and it still didn't work :(
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think this book doesn't have great reviews because people acted too quickly. When I first finished it, I was shocked and very angry with the ending. But then I took some time to think about it, and realized that what Veronica Roth did was kind of perfect, in a way.<br /><br />So maybe the book doesn't have a happy ending. But that isn't what dystopian books are about. In dystopian books, just like real life, bad things happen and people die, and it doesn't matter who they are or how much you love them. The point is that people get up afterwords, and they keep fighting to fix things. Allegiant shows that better than any book I've ever read.<br /><br />Allegiant isn't a perfect book, and it doesn't end the way we want it to. But it's beautifully realistic, and that is something that's hard to find in a book. I do think that fans of Divergent should read this. It's painful, but it stays true to the world of Divergent and the personalities of the characters. And the message to be brave and carry on is there until the end. As painful as it is, I think Veronica Roth made the right choice.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I like the nice red simple cover for my kindle. Installation was VERY easy. I would recommend it to others.

0062265733|5.0|Beautiful book with vividly colored illustrations and elegant binding! Sendak would be proud of this 50th anniversary edition. I wish I could afford a first edition, but, in a way, this edition is better because of the enhancements.

B00A6QPQDO|1.0|i was not aware that this dvd was all in german. i am sorry now that when i ordered it that  the information on the dvd was not more explicit regarding the language. so basically i wasted my money on this movie.
B00FEX2ZFG|1.0|I love supernatural horror stories and really hoped this one would live up to it's hype.  And, while I did get goosebumps a time or two and responded to most of the predictable jump out of your seat frights and while there was a subtle eerieness through some of the film, as many other reviewers have commented, the film was very cliched and was really more a compilation of scenes and story lines from countless other films.  And, the appearance of the witch and ghosts was pretty lame - blackened eyes and cracking white makeup.  The Grudge did exponentially better with plain old white and black makeup.  The creaking doors, tossed balls and banging were considerably scarier than the poorly made up ghosts and witch.  Unlike many other films today which overuse CGI, I wish the creators of this film had incorporated even a little CGI to enhance the spooky, but all of their special effects and makeup looked like first year quality film student work.  And what was up with the seeming foot fetishes of the ghosts - couldn't the writers have had the ghosts do more than play footsie and pull hair?  Aside from those awkward points, the overbearing and nearly non-stop pushy religious assertions of the Warren characters ruined this film for me.  I understand the real Warrens and the brothers who wrote the movie are all basically jesus freak types, but whether any of them really believed it or not, the seemingly constant rambling about missions from god and exortations to baptise the children, and submit to god and all that type of BS, as well as the hokey insertion of crosses all over the place was forced and ultimately hollow.  In fact, rather than add to the chill and thrill of the story, the religious propaganda did nothing more than disrupt my viewing of the film.  This cheesy incorporation of clobbering religious aspects was in stark contrast to The Exorcist where the appeal to religion felt organic and ultimately imperative on behalf of the characters and so was completely natural and essential to the plot.  Another weak element was that overall, the acting was pretty sketchy, for instance, I really like Ron Livingston, but in this film, he seemed more like a set piece - a wooden mannequin - than a contributing lead - I don't think his facial expression changed once throughout.  And, while young Joey King was exceptional at conveying terror in her scene with the unseen entity lurking in the dark corner behind the bedroom door, sadly, Lilli Taylor conveyed more a sense of over the top soap opera melo-drama than terror in many of her scenes and that bagged headed exorcism scene was a total joke.  Vera Farmiga just seemed glassy eyed and dreary, except for the very brief scene where the possessed Canadian grabbed her arm eliciting a fairly realistic sense of horror from her character.  And sadly, Patrick Wilson just came across as another religion bully with his character.  Finally, as many others have pointed out, the ending was way too corny - jeebus saves the day - yay!  Seriously???  I give this movie 1 star meaning 'hated it' because of the poor dialogue, weak plot, slow pacing, poor effects, poor acting and overbearing religious propaganda.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This is a great family film.  My family really enjoyed it, and will probably be purchasing it. I totally recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|So as per mr. Howey's request - I will rate each part of this omnibus, and then look at it as a whole.<br /><br />Part 1: while it may be a prologue for the book, this part is great. Although short - dot does not lack the intrigue and suspense of more extended books.<br /><br />Part 2: an amazing continuum. Characters become deeper and more developed, and the web of the silo is slowly unraveled.<br /><br />Part 3: this is my favourite part. The writing is fluent, the characters become round.<br /><br />Part 4: the name of this part suits the book, in many ways, not all of them good. While the high standard of writing still remains - some small errors do creep into the story that unfortunately tears the reader away from the world, even if it's just for a second. I don't mean to sound petulant, but if a character is referred to throughout the entire book by one name and all of a sudden, just for one sentence - it is suddenly referred to by its nickname - that takes away some of the atmosphere.<br />(Having read this paragraph again - I do feel petulant!)<br /><br />Part 5: this part, while tying loose ends and condenses the story - it sometimes feels like it dredges on and on for no real reason. Some parts, while may be written for a suspenseful purpose - turn to be nothing more than lengthy and purposeless expansions. And there is an obvious over use of the word &#34;brackish&#34;.<br /><br />Overall: 4 stars. Starts Amazing but loses some of the drive towards the end unfortunately. Some small editorial mistakes are disappointing, but overall do not take away the brilliance of the book.<br />I will admit that I did sometimes feel like the author was sitting with a thesaurus.<br /><br />Over all, a great great read. I enjoyed it immensely and will recommend highly. Can't wait to continue the trilogy.
B003B02O7I|4.0|This  book  is  well  written  and  has  an  interesting plot.  It is very  engrossing  and  entertaining. Grisham  is very talented.
B008QYT7DI|4.0|I like the lesson that quality is more important than quantity when it comes to happiness.<br />the book is written easy enough for children not the lessons seem to be targeted at adults.<br />I took off one point for a rather boring plot even if it had led to deeper reflection on the hidden messages.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Definitely creepy! Wonderful cast of characters. Dark Tower fans will recognize similar types of villains. Dan Torrence's gifts have continued to haunt him, as he is introduced to a little girl with her own set of powers. They come together to fight against psychic vampires. Compelling and highly readable!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a great game and I recommend it. It is great for all ages and is kid friendly and is really easy to play.
0375869026|5.0|This is a very powerful lesson wrapped in an engaging story.  Captivating from the beginning and written with a unique, point-of-view narrative, Wonder tells the tale of how we adapt to and face differences in others.  It is no surprise that Wonder is one of the most talked-about books of the year and is on many must-read lists.  I do not believe I have tapped into the power of this book, as I have not shared it with students and fostered the powerful discussions that might result.  Right now it is making its way around our family and friends.
B00C6ZDBXU|5.0|listening to this album its hard to believe how young these guys are.hailed by none other than paul weller as his choise for band of the year,these guys bring me back to the yardbirds,animals,&them.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the best Grisham has written in my opinion.  I devoured it in 2 days and couldn't put it down.  I went through many emotions and am not embarrassed to say that I cried at the end.  I highly recommend it.
B00AEBB8QK|5.0|This isn't just a chick flick.  Oh, it looks like a sausage party on the cover, and I watched it with a chick, but the story has enough originality to be cool for a straight guy to watch without feeling weird.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book and finding out how Danny fared after his frightening childhood in the Overlook.  The story was quite intense, yet empowering as to both the teenage girl and the troubled, alcoholic man.  Scary, warm, even funny in places.  I'd highly recommend it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me reflect upon anything and everything  I have ever thought .believed I.  It made me look at the world as a blind man. Your use of  literacy profound. Moreton to optional so I loved this book. Sorry for the typos I have a hard time crying and typing  my feelings. Thank you for being you. An inspiration everywhere.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|With all the other games available on the Kindle Fire this one is worth playing.<br />The controls are very simple but it a very fun game.  Give it a try.
1861085257|5.0|This book is really great, very cute, and it is easy to read, picture was very clear. I will buy another book which written by this author.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Video is badly synced but that might be a function of my network bandwidth. I'm not sure.  I have a 3meg DSL  and a 10/100 network. I'm wireless N at the router but I have a 11G repeater nearest my TV.  If all that is Greek to you, all I'm saying is that if you have newer equipment or more capable equipment YMMV.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|We like understated indie films so much preferred the Swedish version and performances, especially Blomkvist.  the Swedish actor, and all the other actors for that matter, seemed more real.  Hollywood makes everything so darn slick, the edit cuts so fast, no lingering on faces, more realistic shabby sets.  Nothing against Craig or Mara, and I love Robin Wright in anything she is in, and maybe it's because we saw the Swedish film first, but to us it was hands down more entertaining and ultimately more scary, because it seemed more possible.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally love this game!!!!! So excited when app finally became available for the Kindle Fire, instead of the users guide lol
B005UT29Z0|1.0|Wow what a waste of my time. How in the world did this movie get such good reviews is beyond me.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Excellent story line and acting!!  Online access was perfect.  Netflix is backed up and there is a long wait for several episodes.
B000FC146C|5.0|It's a haunting story, which I think of even after finishing it 2 weeks ago already. Thoroughly loved it. So much better than the movie/series.
B00DEFW998|1.0|There were 92 reviews for the Album Rise. It is understandable. That was a peak in the career of this very talented musician. However, this album not only disappoints but seems to repeat itself. I regret I purchased it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Easy to follow step by step directions. Exactly what I needed to know with out any extra fluff.<br /><br />More iformation about inserting pictures and tables would have been helpful, but otherwise extremely helpful.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I can see how this is one of the most addictive games out there right now try it and you will see.
006202406X|1.0|Boring and awful. Can't imagine what the writer and publisher were thinking. My grandsons are waiting for this book after books 1 and 2. They'll learn that writers sometimes blow it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|GREAT GAME. You can't go wrong choosing this one. I played for hours the first day that I had it. I have enjoyed all the dungeon hunters but this one is the best.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Possible spoilers:<br />I was pre-spoiled for the ending by reading here.  I was very upset about the ending after reading the reviews.  The ending (after reading it) didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.  It was sad but beautifully so.  What does bother me is how much this ending ruined the series for me.  I can not enjoy this couple who were set up as soulmates thinking about how they were separated and what was lost.  I find it hard to accept that Tobias left her to deal with the situation that led to her death alone.  He had an obligation to Uriah's family, but honestly, any of his friends could have gone to fetch them, and he could have made his confession later.  I find it hard to believe that Tris' sacrifice was unforseeable from Tobias' perspective.  I have a problem with Tobias' lack of insight throughout this particular book (whether it comes to Tris' intuition being right, Tris being likely to take her brother' s place, his relationship with Evelyn [carried over from Insurgent] or being tricked by Nita).<br /><br />We saw this same ending in Insurgent but with a different outcome, and the sacrifice that Tris made in Insurgent made a lot more sense (preventing the loss of innocent life).  She had a symbolic death and resurrection.  There was a completeness about that \\"death\\" that made this sacrifice seem like an epilogue.  It paled in comparison to the one in Insurgent even though her motivation was more selfless vs. reckless this time.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias' morality is all over the place in Allegiant.  They break Caleb out of custody because he's Tris' brother, but Caleb was a co-conspirator in events that led to the deaths of hundreds of people and deserved to stay in custody.  Many reviews have criticized the morality of being ok with erasing memories of the government workers to prevent the erasing of the memories of the factioned/factionless/Allegiant society.<br /><br />Re: Romance.  It feels very unconsummated although their last scene together was somewhat ambiguous.  I thought for sure we would have a real emotional climax moment in this book if not a HEA.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the romance, however, is that the ending made Evelyn right when she said that Tris was only temporary and that she, Evelyn, was permanent.  This is just awful if you love this couple and have been a loyal fan of the series.<br /><br />Re: Genetically damaged (GD) vs. Genetically pure (GP): We spent two books with the factioned society, and it was pretty clear that these were folks segregated based on personality rather than genetics.  They didn't live up to their factions because they were made that way...They struggled to keep their anti-faction tendencies under control, either with sheer will or peace serum.<br /><br />I also felt the GD/GP conflict seemed contrived to keep Tobias in a state of unease and self doubt and reinforce the fact that Tris was unique and he was not.  You have to ignore many things that happened in the first two books to be able to accept this.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the POV shifting (other than having to page back about 8 times on Kindle) is the loss of Tris' narrative voice.  I felt doubly deprived by Tris' death because I lost the enjoyment of her voice for 1/2 of this novel.
0385351399|1.0|I'm not going to go into details about what this book is about, there are lots of those reviews posted here for you to read through. Suffice to say that the book looked interesting enough for me to pick up and, as other reviewers have noted, it is an engaging read, one that is hard to put down. It was jam packed with interesting observations on our Google+, FB, Twitter, Instagram, web-cam, Google Glass world that we are all residing in and I would gladly have given it 5 stars but for the following:<br /><br />The book itself is dividing into three &#34;books.&#34; The first two books were great, both in terms of the story as well as the thoughtful commentary on our social media driven world. Again, I had a hard time putting the book down as I read it, following the transparency of Mae's life and the issues it was causing her parents and close friends. With great anticipation I flipped the page to start reading book three, only to find...<br /><br />that it was the worst let down of any book that I have ever read. And I've read a LOT of books.<br /><br />Mr. Eggers, what were you thinking? It's like you took us on a wild roller-coaster ride to the edge of a cliff and just as we were ready to experience the final plunge you simple end it by having Mae tell us in a single line what happened? (I'm not going to post a spoiler for anyone, but the sentence begins &#34;With a duty that felt holy...&#34;) Book three was supposed to be the climax of the story, where all of the secrets were revealed and the truths exposed. Instead you give us five pages of character reflection on a plot summary? Come on! If I may paraphrase from your book, &#34;The Circle needs to be closed&#34; and I'm disappointed that you didn't take the time to finish the book. It's like you saw you were getting close to a certain page limit and then decided, whoops, better end this now before I cross the 500 page threshold.<br /><br />Definitely a frown, thumbs down and unlike from me. The first 492 pagesI was giving you 5 stars, but you get ZERO stars for the last 5 pages. Spend your money if you wish, readers, but be prepared to feel like Mae did after one of her sexual encounters with Francis.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|This documentary revealed things to me about whales, and Sea World I was ignorant about.<br /><br />After watching this disturbing documentary on the treatment of Tilikum, I don't wonder why he kills his trainers, I wonder why he doesn't kill all of them.<br /><br />He was snatched as a baby from his mother and forced to spend most of the day in a tiny black metal box at Sea Land. He was attacked by female whales, his skin shredded. At Sea Land he killed a female trainer so the owner closed the park.<br /><br />Then Tilikum was bought by Sea World. There he killed another trainer, and probably a male visitor, who was found dead floating on Tilikum's back. He has injured many. Tilikum is viciously attacked by female whales so he spends most of his life just sitting in a tiny, shallow pool. Another sick aspect of his captivity is the use of his sperm to make more Orcas to sell to be exploited. I don't even want to say here how they obtain it. The footage of that in this documentary is truly revolting.<br /><br />Putting these majestic animals in bathtubs for people to scream at is reprehensible and disgusting.
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|I had always read in professional reviews this live LP was kind of weak as the band had better live performances and/or phases.<br /><br />Truth is, yes, it is a notch below the fiery performance captured on \\"Live At The Fillmore East\\" but not by much.  The band is pretty tight and focused.<br /><br />The drum solo song, \\"Hobbit\\" is the weakest track just because it is a drum solo.  Not knocking Ric Lee as a drummer or anything but drum solos arn't as exciting to hear than to see.<br />That said, at least it doesn't go on forever like some drum solos do.<br /><br />Out of all released live material by TYA, most songs come from the pre-Columbia days, except a few Columbia LP tracks, which happened to have been recorded live in concert.  The original LP of \\"Recorded Live\\" contained a handful, \\"One Of These Days\\", \\"You Give Me Loving\\", \\"Standing At The Station\\" and \\"Choo Choo Mama\\".  These tracks came from 4 different shows in Europe.  This is the ONLY way you can get Columbia-era live tracks (except one - more on that later).<br /><br />The 2013 remaster adds bonus tracks to the now 2 CD release (the original US Columbia release eliminated \\"Hobbit\\" to make it one CD) and it is just stuffed full of music.  Many songs are extended jams.  One bonus track, \\"Time Is Flying\\" is not on ANY TYA studio release.<br /><br />The sound quality on this 2013 remastered CD is excellent, for any live release I've heard.  I never had the original LP but did hear it once or twice decades ago, but I don't recall it sounded as good as this.  The liner notes say the band wanted this to be a good-sounding definitive live album and they used the Rolling Stones Mobile to record the shows.  This was to counter some poor-sounding bootlegs which were coming out at the time.  The booklet is a nice addition with an informational essay.<br /><br />Now for the complaints (!).  It is just my opinion but when adding bonus tracks, why add more versions of the same songs already on the original LP (\\"Help Me\\" and more jams)?  Also, why not include some other Columbia-era tracks that weren't on the original LP?  There is a new 2013 release of the original studio album \\"Positive Vibrations\\", which includes a bonus live disc of other tracks from the same 4 shows recorded on this tour.  That bonus disc contains \\"Rock And Roll Music To The World\\" and \\"Once There Was A Time\\" (one of my personal favorites from \\"A Space In Time\\"). Why not include them here to make it a more complete Columbia-era experience?  But then again, \\"Positive Vibrations\\" may be the band's weakest/worst LP, so perhaps nobody would buy the remaster without that trick.  That's one thing that makes the box set \\"Think About The Times - The Chrysalis Years\\" a strong release and better value to NOT have included that LP!<br /><br />Any new or existing fan of TYA will enjoy this release.  For a more smoking live recording, \\"Live At The Fillmore East\\" is hard to beat but this one is close behind.<br /><br />Where is that entire Woodstock performance?  How about Isle of Wight as well?  How about something from the 1989 reunion tour?  Hello?p Me\\" and more jams)?

B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Not a huge tablet gamer, but a big zombie fan.  While very simple to play I find it really engaging, and fun.  You'll find yourself cursing corn fields, and gleefully tossing grenades.
B00E8AVNBI|5.0|Running time approx. 1hr 40min. DTS-HD 5.1, HD Picture widescreen.  An outlaw gang member (Danny Trejo) is betrayed by his own gang, and they kill him, he ends up in (hell), and makes a deal with the devil to spare his soul in exchange for the death and souls of his former gang members.  This movie was well written and beautifully filmed. Stunning cinematography. Stunning props, western sets, period wardrobes, and make-up.  Great special effects and acting. This movie is very impressive, and we all love (Danny Trejo) who plays a very good (gritty) outlaw.  No surprises there, as (Danny Trejo) is well suited for the tough guy roles. I think Mr. Trejo plays western cowboy characters very well, and should continue to bring us more western movies. There are no (dry or boring) areas in this movie; it's full-on action from the start and lots of serious gun fights and blood. There really is nothing bad that I can find in this movie, it was perfectly produced. Love it. This one is a keeper. Buy on Blu-Ray.
0446672653|1.0|Please  don  t  misunderstand  me  ,<br />Only  love  is real  is  a  title  which  sounds  me  so meaningful !  I  feel  uneasy  to  criticize  a  books  which<br />has  collected  so  many  positive  rewiews  .<br />But  there is  no  other  way .<br />I  warn  you  not  to  buy  the  book  :  it  contains<br />a  serious  flaw  that  makes  impossible  to  claim  the  thesis  .  The  author wrote  in the  middle of  book<br />Don  t  be  afraid  and  take  your  risks  .

B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Running Time approx. 1hr 40min. HD Widescreen, HD Sound 5.1. A very impressive movie. Out of all the paranormal (type) of movies out there, this one got it right and it will scare the (s***) out of you as it did me. A family buys a house and does not realize that its haunted until its almost too late. This movie is perfectly produced. Every square inch of(time)in this movie was managed very well. There are no (dry or boring) areas, the movie keeps you on edge every minute. The first (5) minutes will scare the hell out you. The next (36) minutes will practically give you a heart attack. But the rest of the movie will certainly put you in a state of full shock. My hats off to the producers, they got this one right! The acting is spot on. Period props, sets, period wardrobe, and make-up are amazing. The special effects are (spot on) with top quality CGI.  This is the perfect ghost/exorcist movie ever, without saying too much. This movie actually makes the original (Exorcist) look like child's play. The title of the movie is also misleading, they should have named it (The Haunted House), that's basically what the movie is about...nothing is really (Conjured up). Thank me later. Otherwise, this is the perfect late night Halloween scary movie! I recommend purchase on Blu-ray, this one is a keeper.
B00127RAJY|5.0|All 3 levels kick your butt & really make you work out. In a month and a half I lost 12 lbs doing only this DVD. I didn't even change my diet. I have a ways to go, but seeing how well this DVD helped me definitely kept me coming back daily!<br /><br />I do this every morning M-Sat taking Sundays off.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|playing this version is more for relaxation than excitement.  that's why I like it.<br /><br />_<br /><br />This version is more relaxing than challenging.  I play it to slow down my brain in the evening.
B0037471TE|5.0|Kept me confused and thinking throughout the entire book. Excellent read if you want something to keep you turning those pages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I find myself wanting to play it all the time.  I can see why everyone loves it.  This is a great game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very good game I love to play it with my facebook friend's,  It also has pretty common updates unlike most games.
B00C4QD5IW|5.0|This movie is something women watch after a bad day.  You curl up with a blanket and some ice cream, and let 'er rip.  It is so sugary and sentimental, full of angst and sacrifice.  There's the other woman, a secret withheld, and wonderful images.  Such a deal.  Ladies, put this one between &#34;Sleepless in Seattle&#34; and &#34;An Affair to Remember&#34; on the bookshelf.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This is the best thing I have read in years.  I actually also got the audio book so I could listen.  Altho it's filled with descriptions of science experiments, these are quickly translated into how this might explain my own behavior.  Why can't I stick to my diet?  Holy Cow, why did I buy THIS shirt?  Now I have insight.  How often can you say a book changed your life for the better?  This one has!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book!! It had many dark and twisty turns that keep me reading late into the night!! Looking forward to reading more Elizabeth Haynes books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had no problems hooking this unit up, and running the chrome browser to work with it. I am able to use it for whatever runs to my computer, like hulu, netflex, amazon prime movies, pandora, uverse, etc.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was the laziest ending to a book. Couldn't let it be a happy ending- instead killed off the main character and switched to a new one five chapters from the end.
1451620829|5.0|Peter Criss has lived the life, and he tells it with all the highs and lows in great detail in this book.  Being a Kiss fan from a little kid, I simply could not put it down.  A great read for Kiss fans, or anyone that like biographies about rock stars from the 70's and 80's.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|i have been trying to install this app it downloads but it says there is not enough room to install and i have uninstalled nearly every app plus some pis :((
006202406X|1.0|I was a huge fan of the series thus far and like most readers of the trilogy, I was eagerly awaiting this final installment. However, I immediately noticed the difference in writing and character development compared to the first two books. I was bored and waiting for the \\"old\\" Four or Tris to reappear and it never happened. Chapter after chapter, I was left more disappointed than the last. I was more angry than sad at the end as I know not every novel ends with a happy story but at least they can be written well. I was not impressed at all with the final book and I will be returning it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the funniest game love to play and love playing with my friends and family. Hope they keep making more leave and more fun for all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally fun addictive game. Hard enough to be challenging but east to learn. Glad it is finally on my kindle
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This is the most fun I've had with an app for a very long time! I only played it on Kindle Fire; not sure if it would be too small for a phone.<br />Seriously fun puzzles, but not too hard. The toughest part is finding all of the secrets. There is even a special reward for you if you get all of the stars!<br />I will admit that I had to look up solutions a couple of times, and the one \\"cart jumping\\" part was very difficult, but I seriously enjoyed this game... a lot!!!
B000274THQ|5.0|This film surprised me in many ways.  Although a rather unusual story and somewhat implausible, the crew of the film play it convincingly and with love.  Perhaps, because the film is about love -- the love of a son for his mother.  The political message is kept low key and free of dogma, but it is there for any who cares to pay attention. Possibly not a film for everyone, but because of its humorous angle, I believe it will appeal to far more viewers than one might expect.  OC
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I was surprised at how well made and entertaining this movie is.  The story line seems improbable but the director and actors did an excellent job of putting it all together.
B0000VD04M|5.0|A film about dreamers...and losers who go for broke in achieving their purposes in life.  The entire ensemble give it their all in this film which is marvelously acted and directed.  I loved it and recommend it to anyone who cares about real, but flawed people...which Ed Wood was and might have been. Sadly, the film has been somewhat overlooked by the public, but it is likely the producers of the film knew they were not making a main-stream film to begin with.  Nevertheless, this film buff can't recommend 'Ed Wood' highly enough to those who care about real films.  OC
B005HEJYXS|3.0|So now when we meet some version of space marine, the females get the (successful) fight scenes. \\"We have gone past intolerance...\\", yeah, the liberal idea that advanced means PC. And then when attacked, the command to return fire always seems to take forever, the shields are not always on. There is no military posture. The season started off without the insufferable PC of ST:TNG, but it is starting to infiltrate this series.
B008U3NU38|5.0|Shipped perfectly, it was packaged safe and securely. As far as the boxed set itself, this is great! The re-mastered tracks sound brilliant and I love the extras that are included. I had all these albums on cassette from way back when, and its nice to have them all on CD now.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|The take on how the zombies come about and how they spread was great.<br /><br />The action and story was excellent.<br /><br />Audio was superb, Video was excellent.<br /><br />I have only watched the Blu-Ray on my Plasma and the Digital copy on my phone, but on both it was excellent.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Turn your dumb TV in to a smart TV.  The only complaint I have is that the Youtube control gets disconnected, resulting in the Chromecast erasing the queue.
B0000633T6|4.0|This is an intelligent film that makes you think, keeps you guessing and has a plot that will intrigue you.  It is Nathan's (Robert Redford) last day at the CIA before retirement when he discovers a colleague/friend, Tom Bishop (a great performance by Brad Pitt), has been captured by the Chinese who will execute him in 24 hours unless Nathan does something.  The CIA is very aware of the situation but seems ready to allow the execution.  Nathan has to find out everything on his own, and why Tom Bishop was in China is as much a surprise to us as it is to him.<br /><br />This is a really taut thriller with fantastic performances, a great plot and wonderful directing.  I highly recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you excited to read constantly, has me finding excuses to sneak off and find time to actually read haha
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great, evocative book but super depressing ending. I don't read to be depressed. I read for enjoyment. But Veronica Roth did an excellent job because I don't get depressed about people who are fictions very easily. Great job Veronica but I wish things would have ended differently.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I wasn't really sure what to expect since I don't read this style often but it was pretty good.  Had some cyber punk elements to it but I would really classify it as it's own style.  You don't have to be a big 80's nerd to appreciate it either.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite game.Have been waiting for it to come to kindle. Thanks for making it available. Now I can play as much as I want.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Still reading this, but the story gets better and better as I go. The characters are more familiar in this one than the last.
0743554450|5.0|This book was truly amazing. I couldn't put it down. It will go down as one of my favorite books.  It was a gut-wrenching, emotional story about two women and how lives intersect. I learned a lot about life for women in Afghanistan and it's history. Beautifully written.
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|I might be too generous w/my 2 stars, but initially it was kinda fun. What really destroyed it was the &quot;challenge&quot;. It's almost unwinnable, no matter what you train on, pretty much expect to lose that on the reg. And once you get to the later matches, losing that means losing the match.<br /><br />I kept hoping I could figure out the formula, but there is none.<br /><br />Then there's the difficulty progression, which is works like a 5 speed transmission going from 1st gear straight into 5th. The first 30 or so matches just breezed through (of course losing almost every challenge along the way,) then they went to nigh impossible, requiring 4 or 5 lvl ups (which means losing that many times and training that many times,) before you win. And that's if you can KO your opponent before a challenge, because by this stage, when they win the challenge, you're getting knocked out.<br /><br />I got this app as an app of the day, therefore free. Which at that price was fun for a bit, heck, I wanted to like it, but really is just a novelty, have time to waste game. At $0.99 I could almost understand a cost, but at $2.99, you're wasting money. Much better games out there.

B001BANK32|5.0|I had to re-buy this on kindle because I wanted to read the sequel. You think just because you watched the movie again that you know what's going on? You don't!!! Re-read it! The movie doesn't do the novel justice! There is so much more, especially if you want to read &#34;Dr. Sleep.&#34; There is a lot to go back to, a ton of relevant information to the sequel that you won't even comprehend from just watching the movie. I hadn't read &#34;The Shining&#34; in over twenty years. I'm so glad I got it again!
0307588378|5.0|This is a reverse whodunit.  It is told through the viewpoint of a husband whose wife has vanished after 5 years of marriage, contrasted with the diary entries of the missing wife.  The reader is hearing the point-of-view of, and thus is naturally sympathetic to, the husband, while subtle and not-so-subtle clues mount to paint him as a murderer.  It was a very compelling story with an unexpected ending that was very poignant.

B00FPH51LQ|4.0|If you're in for a story that doesn't have any holes in it, not sure this is the movie for you.  With an additional 15-20 minutes of story line development and background information up front, the movie would have flowed a bit better.  Because of this missing info, you need to make a few suppositions to fill in the blanks as the movie progresses.<br /><br />There is a good portion of laugh out loud moments, but also quite a few &#34;what did he say&#34; parts because of Jeff Bridges' overly heavy, southern drawl.<br /><br />This movie is geared mostly toward a light comedy audience, with little drama and emotional undertones.<br /><br />If there was an option for 3.5 stars, I would have selected that.  -Worth renting, and watching as a rerun on HBO or some other premium channel.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I was especially glad to get the DVD for the 10th season of NCIS because my work schedule caused me to miss a number of the episodes. It's also nice to have the DVDs to watch the shows back to back, thus retaining more of the ongoing story line. As always, Amazon delivered my order quickly and without problems.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Very easy to use, easy set up of alarms too. Display is simple to read and uncluttered. Don't worry a out the ads as very inconspicuous - I  really only see them if I stare at the screen for a while. Not a normal thing to do with a clock, right!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a wonderful game. It's challenging but not to a point where you get frustrated. It keeps you thinking. This game is for anyone who loves mysteries and loves to solves riddles by looking for clues. This is also a great game for those who like to fiddle around with things until they learn how they work.
