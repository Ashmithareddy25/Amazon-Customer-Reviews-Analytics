B0076DCT2G|3.0|I FOUND THE BOOK NOT UP TO DEMILLE STANDARDS.  THE STORY LINE DRAGGED ON AND ON, WITH LITTLE IN THE FORM OF A NARRATIVE THAT WOULD KEEP YOU INTERESTED.  TOO MUCH OF THE TRAVEL THROUGH THE MIDDLE EAST AND NOT ENOUGH ACTION. DEMILLE COULD HAVE SAVED ABOUT A HUNDRED PAGES BY CUTTING OUT THE LONG DRIVES AND DRAGGING US THROUGH THE MEANDERINGS OF HIS COHORTS.  ALSO, THE SNIDE COMMENTS BY THE LEAD CHARACTER GO OLD AFTER A WHILE.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|This was just ok. I would not pay to watch this movie again and I wish I wouldn't have paid for it the first time!

0307951529|5.0|For anyone thinking of starting a business or already in one, this is an amazing read. Not only does it give one practical advice about how to get started, it simplifies the entire process while inspiring one to take action. The beauty resides in its simplicity.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a well done movie, all the way around. The characters were spaced out nicely and all the actors did a superb job.
1439153663|3.0|Interesting premise and it started out well enough.  I think that the problem was that I got increasingly annoyed with the main character.  Everyone but her (the reader and all the other characters) knew what was going on, and/or what the results of her actions would be.  This seemed acceptable enough when she was a small child, but her cluelessness continued on through adulthood and my feelings of annoyance turned to irritation.  I do think that this is a flaw in writing - if the main character has no idea what's going on around her, then it should be at least somewhat of murkey to the reader or perhaps some other characters.  When everything works out for her in the end, I can't be happy for her because I don't like her.  This one might make a better movie than a book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved the book. Particularly from the viewpoint of a doctor deeply trained in the western way of thinking<br />wonderful transformation. Have been recommending it to friends

B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and she has yet to disappoint me.  Just when I thought I had the ending figured out .... WOW!  That's all I can say ..... WOW!  I hope she writes another one soon.
034580404X|4.0|I must say that the first book is really good.  The writer is so good that it is hard to put the book down.  You just want to know what happens next.  I am enjoying book 1 and I'm sure I will be just as intrigued by the follwoing 2.
0307454541|5.0|I enjoyed this first book in the trilogy of books by deceased author Stieg Larsson. I enjoyed reading about the protagonist who has to outsmart her opponents and live life on the edge trying to make sense of a life that has proved to be very difficult so far. She is described in medical reports as &#34;retarded&#34; but defies such small-minded classification by being a computer whiz in real life, always a few steps ahead of her pursuers.
B000040OBS|5.0|Listening to Suicide (Self-Titled) today is to be reminded of a time when artists still had the option of being not just \\"alternative\\" but truly experimental, not merely \\"provocative\\" but truly provoking, not simply \\"edgy\\" but truly, unapologetically angry.  In this utterly streamlined, by-the-numbers, Bieber/Perry/Swift music world of today, in which typicality and mediocrity are rewarded, it's hard to imagine a band like Suicide, that was out to break rules and invent new ones as they went along.  As with any other sonic original--- from Stockhausen to Captain Beefheart--- a first listen to Suicide can be downright off-putting: their debut album is grimy, lo-fi, minimalist almost to the point of self-mocking.  Underneath the DGAF trappings, however, is a collection of tight, scary, memorable meditations on modern pop.  Like '70s shock cinema classic \\"Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom\\", \\"Suicide\\" is not as violent or dirty as reputed, but it is just as disturbing.  Get past the shock value, and you have a valuable work of art.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|This was an entertaining DVD on a robot who was part human. It was a good mix of technology and humanity and it was a good purchase.
B005LAII1C|3.0|When visiting my Marine grandson, his mom,dad,granddad,he and I decided to see Ted on a rainy day. Picture this-Movie full of young Marines,my young guy sitting next to me. When I looked at him I saw tears in his eyes and he is trying not to choke laughing ,because the movie is raunchy and perverse and he is sitting with his grandmother. Finally when the seat started to shake I had to give in and laugh and laugh at him,which made him lose it.His Dad (behind him) was kicking the seat so he would'nt embarrass his grandmother. The whole theater ended in hysterics, I'm sure they were laughing at us as much as they were laughing at TED. The rating for seeing this movie with a young Marine grandson is - priceless.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I am not usually a fan of this type of book. I am more into true crime. I am a huge Maeve Binchey fan, so I am wondering quite far from my usual books. However, having said that, I am really enjoying &#34;Pines&#34; as I did another of Crouchs' books. I will read more of his work.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Combined with exceptional photography, story plot, music and spiritual principals this movie can be watched repeatedly and still get something new from the film.  A must see for those who enjoy exceptional beauty of God's great gifts on all levels.<br /><br />Gabrielle in Ohio
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great book, the suspense just keeps building, all the way to the end of the book.  I am working my way through the series, and have not been disappointed yet.
B005JE1KD8|5.0|Robbin Hobb really captures my imagine I get lost in her books. I especially loved the rain wild chronicles. Also like good strong women characters
B007EECSFA|5.0|Well written. One could almost envision being there. I lived in America at that time as a 7 year old.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Loved it! Nothing compares to the Royal Tenanbaums (sp?), but this was pretty darn close! Much better than Life Aquatic....
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is a beautifully written, and heartbreaking, book.  Rowling does an exquisite job of painting a picture of the depth of sorrow and pain lurking beneath the surface of people's lives in many different walks of life. In contrast though, she also shows the amount of good a single kind person can achieve.  The man who has died, leaving the \\"casual\\" vacancy, leaves such a desperate hole precisely because of the influence for good he was in his life.
B008B92U32|1.0|could never even get it to work, and it would swap really weird and half faces. I dont think I will try this again unless I just did it  wrong somehow
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was truly looking forward to reading about The NDE that Dr. Alexander experienced, however there was very little actually written about what he saw and experienced.  I would have to say that 98% of this book is about what his family experienced which I am not demeaning, however there was a much greater opportunity to try to put into words what was seen felt and heard for the rest of us in the afterlife.  I have read many, many other stories that were far more informative and descriptive than this and to the Drs' own admission, he spent far more time unconscious than many others in this situation.
B003O86FBS|3.0|A good read but not as good as riverton. Dragged on a little at times so skimmed quite a bit of it at the end and deduced the ending before getting halfway through.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i think this is a really fun game  and i think that you should keep your nasty opinons to yourself
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham at his best. Albeit a bit different motiff but spellbinding and fast action to the end. Ties together beautifully the last two chapters.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Excellent DVD.  Season 7 IS MOST AWESOME. A MUST BUY ON ANYONE'S CHRISTMAS LIST<br />THE WINCHESTER BOYS ARE OUT IN ABOUT FIGHTING THOSE NASTY LITTLE DEMONS.  WATCHING SEASON 8 ON THE CW CHANNEL.  AWESOME!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this show. The acting is superb and the story is so compelling. In addition, the portrayal of a talented professional (Claire Danes) who is also struggling with a mental illness is thoughtfully and poignantly acted!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Hunger Games Series.  I read all 3 books back to back in less than 2 weeks.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Just when I thought Wes Anderson was tapped out and doomed to make essentially the same movie over and over again, he surprised me with this gem.
B0098460O4|2.0|Together is disappointing and I blame Simon. He told Charlotte she would hold Jonathan back and she leads on 7 of the songs. The prayer should have used the original audition arrangement and Jonathan doesn't need back up singers.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I think \\"Celebration Day\\" has both Plant and Page being sharper, tighter, and more detailed than ever before. Page's playing is more dramatic and Plant's singing more inflected than on any of the bootlegs I've heard (from \\"Minnesota Blues\\" to Knebworth).<br /><br />John Paul Jones's keyboards are myriad and beautiful, his bass playing necessary. In the chemistry of Led Zeppelin, Page and Plant may be the main ingredients, but with this concert Jones proves himself the chemist. There's just no comparison between this album and any of the Page/Plant live bootlegs I've come across.<br /><br />In fact, I've never listened as repeatedly to a Zep live album (bootleg or official) as to this one. Not a second is wasted.<br /><br />Yes, there's a certain youthful exuberance, a Zeitgeist, missing. But what's here has a spark of its own.<br /><br />While I miss John Bonham's drumming and thought for awhile that Jason was more of a timekeeper, \\"How the West Was Won\\" and various bootlegs told me different. It seems to me that, whereas John was the rhythmic force of the band, Jason shares the driving with Jimmy Page's riffs. Page seems completely in tune and time with Bonham; together, they seem tighter than the Zep of old. More tight than loose suits Page, whose forte was never the ten-minute guitar solo (the one misjudgment in the '77 gigs).<br /><br />The statements made by the individual band members in the booklet suggest a band that was nervous (\\"no place to hide\\"), excited (\\"energy and the chemistry . . . absolutely still there\\"), well-prepared (\\"rehearsals . . . shaping the set . . . We were ready!\\"), anything but complacent. I'd recommend therapy to someone not moved by Jason's words.<br /><br />Sadly, the unbalanced negative reviews already generated by the concert justify Plant's concern about Jason's having fun \\"because no one can take that away from you.\\"<br /><br />Sadder yet is that this is the only new music Zeppelin has released in over thirty years. As with Hendrix, what could have been accomplished is just not imaginable.<br /><br />Saddest of all is that this is the best work the three remaining original members have created since Bonzo's death. For whatever reason, their decision not to work with each other now seems a tragic mistake.<br /><br />Coda1: I wonder what the garden tapes guy will have to say about this release :)<br />Coda2: Why does \\"How The West Was Won\\" sound much better (broader, fuller, more detailed) even though it was recorded 35 years before \\"Celebration Day\\"?
1611761557|5.0|The anticipation in waiting for the release of the Auto-Biography and especially the Audiobook read by the author felt like it took FOREVER to arrive!  I read the book, but I will tell you that hearing the book read by JT gave it a more personal feeling, his words, his inflection and just HIM!  It provided more meaning to the written words. It is interesting to learn about his roots, his parents, and his life growing up in the Catholic Church, his relationships with his parents while an only child, young adult, super-star and later on in their lives as they began to decline in health. He did address the obvious all things Duran, but I do feel that if you are a ridiculous Duranie as am I, you may feel that he could have taken a little more time to elaborate on such things as being a parent, his relationship with his daughter, his parenting lessons learned & experienced (the funnies and not so funny ones) and morals and his relationship with her as an adult - as she does refer to herself as 'Atlanta The Wild Child'.<br />The honesty he gives us was wonderful. The truth about the women, the drugs, his thoughts, his passions, the fame, the fall, the mistakes, redemption, Rehab and starting a new life - I really appreciated.  The story of meeting his current wife and their first and second date was lovely.<br />He spoke so wonderfully about his parents, described the sadness he experienced upon each of their passing. I'm not a crier, but when his Dad passed, the words he spoke about his incredible loss really touched my heart.<br />He shares his story with us - one that we are so very fortunate to have heard only because he found his way back to life. I was lucky enough to be able to attend one of his book signings, specifically in Austin.  He is great in person!  He read a few chapters, 3 I believe - and it was even better in person.  He is really funny!<br />I encourage you to take the time for this one. Enjoy!<br />God bless he BRITISH!
B003V1WXKU|4.0|In addition to being an enjoyable read, this book provides an insight to the mind and behavior of a real genius: Virtually every interaction with a new subject led him to take on and overcome new challenges -- from deep nuclear physics, to new languages, to interactions with Las Vegas call girls. While I have been told I have a pretty keen IQ, Feynman's ability and capacity to take on intellectual challenges leaves me astounded.  It is a gift to us that he has taken the time to record his thoughts and behavior, of which we should stand in awe.
B002VECM72|5.0|I'm picky about which movies I give 5 stars to. This movie deserves them all. Well written, well acted. Probably Sandra Bullock's best acting I've ever seen. I absolutely love this movie and watch it over and over.
B007V65R54|4.0|Very good illustration of the power of statistical reasoning, using clear, real world examples. Equally good at showing how things go awry when faulty methods are used.
0061726834|5.0|This is the series that needs to be turned into movies, so much better that Twillight!  The writting is so much better, the characters more developed, interesting, and the story-line so unique!  Can't wait for the 3rd installment, I'm practically salivating!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Got the first one to read on a trip and was instantly attached.  On to the next ones!  Can't wait!
B002PNER9U|5.0|Best adaption of a stage musical in years.  Although the cast is almost 10 years older than they and their characters were, they inhabit the parts they created perfectly.  The music is a little less raunchy and rough than on stage, but it's pretty close.  Saw the play twice and the movie several times and still watch it every year or two.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I haven't been able to quit playing since I got the game. It is addicting and I love playing. I would recommend it to friends and family.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really enjoyed it. I did not see the ending coming. It was a OMG ending.  However, One part got way too technical for me.
B002KREVE2|5.0|I was actually there at the Isle of Wight for this concert, and this was the way it was!  It was the first time I heard Leonard, and I became an instant fan.  I've been to several of his concerts over the years (the 2009 one was the best!), and will be going to his new one in December.  But this DVD brings back just how LC was over 40 years ago, when he was just in his 30's.  And the interviews with others who were there make this concert a real treasure.  How fortunate we are that this was recorded.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I like so many other \\"Beatlemaniacs\\" was going to wait until Christmas to sit and listen to the new box stereo set. Like so many others, on account of all the reviews regarding the vinyl pressing issues at \\"Rainbo\\", I decided to open the box set and listen to each album from \\"Please Please Me\\" until The Past Masters.  Well, I have just finished listening to \\"SPLHCB\\" and decided to give my opinion as of right now. I have every available medium of Beatles. From original pressings from the 60's, reel to reel tapes, MFSL, Japanese Red mono, and countless Dr. Ebbetts needled drops to compact discs. This set is without a doubt, the best my ears have ever heard the Beatles. My set is without flaws. Plays perfectly, no skips, no errors, no distortion. Just clear clean \\"being in the studio\\" sound. I am so sorry for all of those who had the misfortune of receiving BAD sets. I hope you finally receive a decent one!  I'm wondering if where you live has anything to do where your set is delivered from? My set came in a vert tight cardboard box with tight fitting styrofoam. I am ordering another.  This is such an improvement over the CD sound. I love vinyl...the whole process of opening up an album...carefully placing it under a needle ....and then the music...oh the music. If you are on the fence about getting this vinyl collection...just do it...take the chance. These will not be around much longer!<br /><br />UPDATE...UPDATE..UPDATE..<br />Well I thought I was out of the woods and had somehow procured a pristine copy of the \\"Beatles Vinyl Stereo Remasters\\"....in fact I was so impressed that I ordered another box set that would remain unopened. I had listened to every album up to SPLHCB and then the \\"inevitable\\" happened. Abbey Road side 2 was unlistenable ( think that is a word). Scratchy noise like razor blades on a chalk board... I opted to return both sets this morning. A real shame....Hopefully all of the complaints and disappointment will light a fire under EMI and Apple to look into this apparently \\"worldwide\\" problem with this set.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game that thankfully can get hard if you are a more experienced gamer...but it could be more interesting. I would reccomend it for ages eight and up because of the slight challenge
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I enjoy reading historical fiction and this book was interesting..  I haven't read much about the French in WW II.  I liked the two stories and was interested to see how they would fit together.
1401224792|3.0|So it's a fun ride, the art's good and the pacing is fine.  There's plenty of violence/gore and female AND male nudity (not for kids, folks) so you get plenty of all kinds of action.  But compared to the other FABLES stuff, it doesn't add a lot to the canon.  It doesn't show us anything about Bigby or Fabletown that we didn't already know.  I'd buy it used or rent it from the library, but if you are interested in the FABLES series, check out 1001 Nights of Snowfall or start with the TPB #1, they are much better ways to get a feel for Fables, and are both very re-readable, which I'm not sure this is...  So all in all, glad I read it, but not all that impressed...
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Great book.  Many names at first but then it gets real interesting like all of Ken Follet's books.  Takes you to Germany, England, America and different parts of Europe but has a real good story behind it.
B004VM7M22|5.0|Excellent record of time & conditions! Absolutely riviting reading!Then, I am a fan of Mr.Follett. Am eating my way through his menu!!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This book made me feel the same i felt when reading about agile software development. It feels like i always knew the right way to do it, but everything i had read before said otherwise. I couldn't stop agreeing with most of the stuff on the book.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I wasted my money. Forced closed everytime I tried to use it on my Samsung Galaxy. Wouldn't do it again.
B000SEGEKI|3.0|Maybe when this book was released the first time, it was a breakthrough. Nowadays all the ideas inside it are common sense.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I know this game sounds stupid but honestly it is a little addictive! I love it! It's good for when you're waiting or just for fun!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Just --- simply --- great.<br />Okay, If you want to knit-pick it could be a little more challenging and the sound track sometimes seems too unsettling, but it's so beautiful and the story so much more compelling than usual that you really don't care. I found myself savoring it and limiting my sessions so it would last longer. Who knows when I'll find another so well done. Bravo, Alawar! If you make them (this well) - we will play! Thank you, and please consider lighter genre too.<br />Note: Use difficult mode. Check G5's \\"Lost Souls\\".
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Many, many years ago I first read Nelson DeMille's By the Rivers of Babylon. It is on my 100 favorite books list. Over the years I have never been disappointed by DeMille, he always delivers a good read.
0316228532|3.0|I put this down and read other books because I couldn't get into the story. It took till the halfway point before it got interesting and longer till I was actually wanting to see where the train wreck was heading. Not what I thought it would be.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and The Racketeer in my opinion is his best work yet. High recommend this book.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|The whole movie can be summed up in one phrase, \\"What a crock!\\" What a waste of digital storage space! Dudley Scott needs to quit trying to deny God. Just one question, where did the aliens come from?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Explained medical terms that we laymen could understand. Love is the answer to all we human's problems made very plained
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Although I love Johnny Depp, I felt this movie could have had more depth and less comedy.  It was a little weak.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Make no mistake- rock n roll doesn't get better than this! The audio on this is nothing short of extraordinary. The band give a glimpse of what made them so good in the first place. Some versions are perhaps the best ones available. Jason Bonham really put his heart and soul into this and it shows- a fantastic performance by him. Page, Plant, and Jones are as good as they ever were. This is a must have for any fan of music- without a doubt Zeppelin was one of the greatest bands ever- and this film proves that their music will live forever.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|It was a decent read.  I am so sad she endured such torture as a little girl.  It made and even stronger cause<br />to keep predators locked up for good once convicted.
B004C3DLJS|3.0|The plot for this movie was weak when compared to ts 1 and ts 3. But the kids enjoyed it and it sets the stage for introducing Jesse's character.  The first and the third movies were outstanding.
0545265355|5.0|Books came in perfect condition wrapped in the factory seal. As for the story goes, that will be for the readers to decide.
B0043D2LAC|5.0|Great for carrying a Canon 50mm 1.4, 430Ex Speedlite and VIXIA HFM41 CAMCORDER or just about anything small enough I need on a shoot.<br />I have not had to use the rain coat but I'm sure it'll work fine.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|The movie is slightly reminiscent of the Saturday morning show \\"Reboot\\", but it certainly expanded upon the idea of video game jumping and delved deeper into character development and plot.<br /><br />The movie is amazing.  For gamers 30 years and older, this is a totally nostalgic trip into the world of video games.<br /><br />For current gamers, the movie shows how games from 30 years ago are still relevant in today's high definition world and how they both can live in harmony.<br /><br />The characters were entertaining and loveable and the story was engaging.<br /><br />I recommend this movie!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that the game is very addictive and I would strongly recommend it for anyone who wants a game to play I. between a busy schedule
0316228532|4.0|This novel was very psychological--the kids are infected by and actually embodying the unconscious of their parents--very dark, but there is a bit of redemption in the end. I think the characters might come to life better on film than they did in the book actually. I could see Gurinder Chadha directing this movie, based on how she has handled family dynamics and redemption themes/strong female characters in past works, and especially since an Indian family plays such a big role in this work.
B008BM9L72|3.0|A tedious book short on story line long on dominatrix. Haven't got to the end and probably never will. Currently at 32%
B004V5A7K8|5.0|The paddle to screen size ratio makes this game a little on the easy side. But that's OK if, like me, you play to relax and have fun rather than having your reaction speed and dexterity challenged.  Good game for kids.
B000MPEIF6|4.0|I enjoy the Resident Evil series. If you are looking it to be like the games when do not bother watching it. If you are looking for a sci-fi apocalyptic film then this is the series for you. The story keeps moving and evolving as it goes continuing to gain suspense. Well worth the watch.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Having worked two blocks from the World Trade Center and watching those towers fall was like a body blow.  This book - in one word - vengeance.  It was a soul-cleansing book for me.  Think I would like to listen to the audio book version also.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I actually watched this movie about 4 times. I could not stand how bad this was to me. When you see advertisements for this you think there would be full songs and you would be able to rock out to it. That is definitely not the case. The songs are about 1/3 of the actual song and cut off usually before the chorus. Picture singing Journey and ending the song before &#34;and it goes on and on and on...&#34;, or having half the songs butchered. I have been told that it is my generation that hates it and honestly that is not the case. When you want to see a musical you want it to have full songs and sing along with it. The soundtrack is exactly like the movie. 1/3 of the song for a full price which is a rip off. This movie was a serious failure to me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent, excellent.  Great plot.  Great story.  Exceptional ending.  It was a very enjoyable read and was the reason I bought a Kindle in the first place as I couldn't picture myself lugging around another King book.  Had to rip one of the Dark Tower volumes in half just to carry it in my tote bag.  This book was so engrossing.
B002M87W9K|5.0|I grew up watching this in choir and band class and loved it. The tunes are all catchy. This movie is a great classic for all ages in the family.
0307730697|5.0|I didn't read this book, I listened to it on my car's CD player. By the way, listen to it if you can.  The reader(Paul Mitchell) is sooo good and he makes the listener feel as if they are listening to the actual people in the book!).  I am humbled by it, inspired by it and am truly thankful that there are people in this world like Adam Brown.  Adam was by no means perfect-- he had his demons--more than most--and rose above them to become the kind of man that would be looked up to, inspired by, and the people who knew him considered themselves fortunate to have known him.  After reading this book, you would have to know that he would never have called himself a hero.  That was not who he was to himself but he became that to many.  He was what we wish for our sons and daughters --not accepting failure but to keep on trying until he succeeded--he would not take no for an answer. Adam was also a wonderful family man, a wonderful son and brother, a \\"spiritual person--not religious as he said himself, loved God and His Son, would defend his \\"brothers\\" and his country at the risk of his life, loved children and was always trying to help people--the biggest tragedy in this is that he did lose his life---WE lost him--but he lives on in others who were inspired by him--including me.  After listening to this book--I went out and purchased the hard back to keep.  Whenever I am in the pits and feeling sorry for myself I am going to have this book situated where I can see it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books I'm so mad they are over I wish there was another series<br /><br /> of books that were all in the mind occur christian. I am not read to stop reading
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author's story is very personal, warm and engaging-which at first I didn't like because I wanted to read his encounter dispassionately.  But I kept reading and his personality and life imbued his story with credibility. His experience is similar to others that have been on that journey. Believable.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Love Johnny Depp and all of the rest of the actors but was disappointed in the plot. Felt it could have been much more interesting. I use to watch Dark Shadows religiously. I really wanted to give it more points but just can't.
B000IXUOP0|5.0|I loved this show. The story line kept you spell bound though out the show. Amazon makes it so easy to watch and or download a show to my kindle.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|This book should be a requirement for anyone that votes. It explains in great detail the correlation between capitalism and our basic freedoms. Maybe I will send a copy to all members of Congress- if they would only read it.
B008ZTW7OU|4.0|This is a great Rock and Roll album, but here is the problem.  No one hears it.  Band guys, your management and record label are doing you no favors by keeping this album at a 9.99 price point.  There are plenty of albums out right now that simply just suck and have a ton more reviews, why? because people have heard of them. This album rocks and was produced by the Black Keys guy (their albums are always on sale) yet no one knows this. It's kinda like Howlin Rain and White Denim. They keep the price point too high and no one takes a chance and thus all this good music is heard by only a handful of people.  Move your album to the $5 bin on Amazon and get people interested and folks will take a chance, and fire your publicist while you are at it, you guys should be everywhere and you aren't.  This music is so much better than that Mumford/Avett/Lumineers crap that is just everywhere. You were on the cover of RS for goodness sake, take advantage of it.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite authors and the Jack Reacher character is my favorite. This one is right up there with the best of both Child and Reacher..
0316182060|5.0|I love the book this is from, and the way they are adapting it for Manga is awesome. The characters feel true to the book with a fun flare of &#34;Manga&#34; with faces and expressions that are totally NOT British, but still fun.<br /><br />Make sure you check out the first one of these too. You can get them month by month in installments from Yen Press with a subscription, but I like waiting to get a whole large chunk at a time.
B005EI86JU|5.0|This book was very helpful! It was much more informative and helpful than the actual manual that came with my Camera (not that I haven't referred to the manual). I ordered this book to arrive at the same time as the camera did, and I'm so glad!
B009LK6JS2|3.0|I'll never understand how people can complain over something that's free. That said it's great for passing time and maybe it might get people interested in flight Sims. It's not X-Plane, and the physics are not for enthusiasts.<br />Pretty decent for fun and passing time.GSII.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham never fails to give value.  The story reveals the under belly of The Justice System; not a pretty site.
0679809015|4.0|I had not realized this was a tiny (about 2&#34;x3&#34;) book, but it is cardboard and the flaps are sturdy. It is small enough for the baby to handle so after you read it a few times, your little one can play with it and chew on it as he looks at the pictures.<br />Read to your children; start young and read often. Readers are better students.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|I didn't remember much about it the next day, which doesn't really say much for it.  I found the premise silly and the plot dull.
0689835604|4.0|This is the sort of book that will let you tickly baby and do a lot of cuddling as you read. What can be better than that? Remember children who are read books at an early age, associate books with entertainment and fun.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Most show seasons have peaks and troughs. This season so far has just been a steady increase in action, drama and twists.  I don't want to know how much farther to the top!

B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game may not be great for younger kids because they will have a lot of angry customers and it may be hard. It is a fun game! Don't forget to get your daily reward !!! Just Wish you could earn more faster with out having to do an in app purrrrrchace (pun intended)  I am not paying to upgrade on a free game that part is lame.
B004DH8IK0|5.0|I heard about this artist from one of my friends and was looking for something new.  When I bought it and started listening, all I could say was JUMPING JAHOSAFAT YEE HAH!!!  You can't go wrong with this album.  It's definitly different and worth your time if you want an exciting new addition to your music collection, trust me.

1401235417|5.0|The Court of Owls is outstanding! I'm an avid Batman fan and I read a lot of graphic novels, and I must say this book ranks right up there with the best Batman books I've read. This is Long Halloween, Year One, and Hush level stuff! The book is beautiful-- the artwork is so vivid and crisp and (I'm being vague to remain spoiler free) the author made some interesting artistic decisions that were fresh and very much added to the aesthetic appeal of this book. This book also offers a very compelling tale-- full of exciting new characters and interesting additions to the Batman mythos. I enjoy reading my comics in a collected format but this book is so riveting it makes me want to rush out and buy the comics continuing the story so I can see what happens next (Night of Owls)! Also, if you are new to Batman, or a casual reader of the cape crusader, you can jump right into this book and understand all the action (as you can with most, if not all, of the New 52s). This is a great detective tale, with a lot of excitement & action and a well crafted story, flush with clever twists and turns that carve some very interesting nuances and additions into the Batman canon. This is must read stuff! I very highly recommend this book-- great for longtime Batman fans, and perfect for folks new to the dark night as well. This isn't just a top quality graphic novel-- it's great literature! Masterful! A +
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The language of Flowers was different from what I have been reading, good story, told well, wish I had the hard copy to look up the flowers in the back.
0061438294|4.0|I teach Interpersonal Communications - and use this book in school<br />It is a book by an ex-FBI agent about how people communicates with their bodies - non-verbal communication. If you are interested in non-verbal communication it is clear and understandable book to read
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I thought this would be a boring game at first, but boy did it surprise me.  It is a low stress, easy, fun game to play.  No ads and passes the time when I'm bored.  I recommend this game.
0374214913|5.0|I really enjoyed this book... if you are not \\"into\\" computers though you might not like it<br />It starts out with Clay Jannon, a recently unemployed graphic designer, stumbling upon Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore after noticing a help wanted sign. He meets the owner, Mr. Penumbra himself, who asks him, \\"What do you seek in these shelves?\\" Isn't that a great question!<br />The book store is quirky and unusual with unique and peculiar customers who seem to be following some kind of strange formula in their choice of books to read. Its a fun story about a mysterious book store that never closes and is involved in a secret society. The peculiar customers always get a book from the Wayback area - and in a certain order. Clay wants to know \\"why\\" - so he develops a computer program to connect their reading path. And with this program the mystery deepens<br />It is also a story about modern information technology, and the possibilities for using it to make new discoveries through everything from Google (which plays a role in the story) to crowd-sourcing.<br />In addition to being beautifully written and keeping me interested and entertained, the hardback cover glows in the dark! Made me smile... especially since I wasn't aware that it glowed in the dark until I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night - lol I love quirky books - and quirky books that glow in the dark ... well... I'm sold
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is fun adorable and great for kids. but you don't have to be young to enjoy the wonders of ponyville!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has done it again in my opinion!  This book is great!  Has an ending I was not expecting at all!
0060935464|5.0|What makes a great book is great characters and that's what I found in Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird--great characters!  I loved Scout, Jem, Dill, and most of all, the gentle Atticus. It's a classic novel that I am so glad that I took the time to read.
B006IRQTWM|4.0|I saw this film theatrically -when it was first released- being me a teenager; I must acknowledge that the movie was big at the time and it impressed me enormously.<br /><br />This is a film that has aged very well in part for the way it was carried out (Lot of filming on location, normal lightning, no-makeup makeup, natural acting) and for the fact that is a straightforward-simple story well told. This is a case in which the sum of the parts is much better that the individual ingredients. Part of the success relies on the shoulders of both protagonists (Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neal in their prime) who had a wonderful chemistry together, and director Hill who delivers a frank no-sense direction. Perhaps the only thing that has not aged so well is -ironically- the immensely famous Oscar-winning musical score (I always felt that it was a little bit at odds with the style of the movie); nevertheless it has its moments (Like the one when Oliver looks for the missing Jenny) that are still powerful and involving.<br /><br />The Bluray looks OK (I still remember that the stock in which the film was made did not looked that well in the Cinema), and the upgraded-from-mono 5.1 DTS-Master HD audio sounds merely proficient. The delivery by Amazon was excellent and swift.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|I read this book first and loved it! Couldn't wait for film version.  If I had not read the book I would have thought this a really good movie.<br />Obviously there are a lot of historical elements that just don't match up between the history and the film. That being said, this is a movie for entertainment, not a dull dry biography.<br />Give it a try....I liked it well enough to buy the Dvd after I watched it!
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was fun to see Rowling other than in a HP role.  I was surprised by the relentlessly dark tone of the book.  It is difficult to think of a single admirable character.
B008KE3960|4.0|Awesome!<br />This game is one of my favorite games. Combination of 2 types of games: tower defensive and air controller games. It's a new generation for game lovers.<br />The only thing that I did not like in this game, was number of free maps. It should be had more free maps.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another classic from the Nelson DeMille, well worth the read..  the world needs more John Corey and his attitude to solve today's problems
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story is written in the present with regular flashbacks to the past. While the present is a bit twee the flashbacks are disturbing and dark. Perhaps the most disturbing of the past is that it was based on real events.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I submitted a review that was not processed but in case it does turn up I want to update it.  The first one was rated 1 star due to the fact that there was confusion over the name of the book and why I couldn't find it anywhere on my Kindle or PC.  This was before I actually read the book.  I see that Little Death by the Sea is the same book by one of the reviews I read (which by the way was more of a Reader's Digest version of the story instead of a review...please stop giving away so much information reviewers).  This may be an updated and renamed book but it always showed that I had bought it previously and I couldn't locate it anywhere.  (Now when I put in the old name, this book comes up but doesn't show a connection.) Anyway, that is not important to you in my review of the book now that I've read it.  I enjoyed this story, there were a few loose ends not tied up neatly...I wanted to know more about Laurent.  I notice that there are more books in the series so I may learn more about him later. I did not have an issue with the French interspersed throughout, I don't speak French but did know some of the words, the ones I didn't know made the confusion of dealing in a different language more real.  I did not guess the murderer, that was cleverly done, and there were a few other twists that captured my interest as well.  The title doesn't make a whole lot of sense but the picture on the cover is gorgeous.  I'd recommend this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I FOUND THIS BETTER THAN THE SHADES OF GRAY, THE CHARACTERS HISTORY ADDED NICELY TO THE BASE. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK
B00913DPW2|1.0|Never got to play this app, because I was never able to download it from amazon's servers. Tried downloading several times, with the download always failing around 25%. Not a connection issue on my end. Will consider revising rating if I am ever able to download the app.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|The movie was as expected, however the case was damaged before it was sent. The clear plastic was really damaged and the paper cover underneath it was badly damaged. So it had to have been sent that way. Very disappointing that someone would send it that way.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|First of all, I am an audio enthusiast. I listen to my music on a high resolution 2 channel (mostly tube amplification) audio system. I built my own DAC and do a number of modifications on my equipment. I am serious about the sound of my rig.<br />I bought two of the Sunken Condos CDs, one for me and one for my brother.<br />My CD sounds vague, fuzzy, and out of phase. I played a number of albums (from the same artist) and the sound was normal, lots of detail, well engineered, and easy to listen to. I borrowed my brother's CD and it sounds wonderful. Just what I expect from a Donald Fagan (or Steely Dan) album.<br />I am not sure what is wrong with my CD, but I suspect that there was a problem in the way that it was manufactured.<br />There was no problem with Amazon or any other aspect of the purchase.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Def a must read!  Great follow to book 4.  Didnt finish the book yet but very much looking forward to it!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I heard others raving about the book but I thought it was just ok. I found the entire thing to be a little anti-climactic as well as the ending to be disappointing.
1423140605|5.0|My son is Rick Riordan's fan.  We have bought all of his books. My son told me this book is awesome.  He is now eagerly waiting for next book to come out in Fall 2013. Highly recommend to 4th graders and above.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|I have been a Led Zep fan for almost 40yrs and I will have to say that when I saw this movie in the theater I had to have it. There was a point on stage between Plant and Page that I will never forget, it is like they were the only 2 people in the theater where they were playing. I am so mad that they will not goon tour, they have it still. Kudos to Jason Bonham following in his Daddy's footsteps, Plant's voice still has it (even though I wish they would have played Immigrant Song), Jones still keeps up with Page and Page there is no way to describe this man at his age. THANK YOU for bringing back my YOUTH.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book.  Wonderful story. I have read all of Grisham's book and this is one of the best.  I could not put this down.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It does what it is supposed to do very well.  I find no faults. Other apps should work as well, but few do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|How Susan Collins went from writing childrens books to timeless classics I will never know. In this masterpiece she creates an astoundingly perfect balance between fantasy and reality. The characters are truly your family you see a colossal bond between these people. Even though they may be all bloodthirsty cato's they are connected by rebellion and love. Although the movie is good it does not come near to doing the book justice. These books are the ones you stay up too late reading, the books you clutch to your chest while crying as it seems that each character you fall in love with dies. When you finish this moving triology you feel emotionally, physically, and mentally tired. Susanne Collins I applaud you.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is a really good movie.  I enjoyed both Ironman and Thor so it was great getting to watch them in a movie together. Could definitely watch more than once.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy living vicariously through this character. If you read and enjoyed the first book then you will also enjoy this one. More true magic comes out in this second book, but it has such a good foundation set by the first book that it feels realistic almost. A believable fantasy adventure. I can't wait for the third one.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.  It shows the date and the weather for the entire week.  It also has a moving background which reflects the weather outside at that particular time.

B009INAGY0|5.0|The year was 1990, Death Metal had exploded onto the scene with countless bands trying to outdo each other's goriest lyric or fastest blast beat, etc. Death were already 2 albums in their career and already heraled as a leading band in the scene. So instead of putting out another gore-drenched, squaling lead, blast beated, general death metal album, Chuck Schuldiner put together a masterpiece for the thinking man's metal, a social commentary on the underbelly of society; Spiritual Healing. Instead of writing about the act of abortion, Chuck wrote about the actual issue from a different perspective, and continued touching topics from drug use in pregnancy, religious hypocrisy, human genetics, and public shootings. Apart for the lyrical advancements in the album, the addition of James Murphy on guitar also played a vital role. Up until then, Death had only good or average players, but Murphy could actually shred and write amazing solos and lead parts, which I think really had impact on Chuck's own growth as a player. Along with the great rhythm section of Terry Butler and Bill Andrews, Death had created the perfect storm that would solidfy them as one of the top-dogs of the genre and innovators for future generations, as in today.<br /><br />So once again, Relapse has done a spectacular job reissuing this important album in the Death Metal genre. Out of all the Death albums, this one has been out of print the longest so I imagine alot of newer fans or some old ones (who may have lost or worn out their old Combat records one) may be looking to get a copy. Well, I can say with full confidence: this is the definitive version of Spiritual Healing. The remastering is crisp and pristine, no bottom end was lost or suffered and the guitars shine bright. It is well worth the upgrade from the orginal CD. The bonus tracks are really great for the more hardcore fans, but I think any fan of Death Metal in general would enjoy hearing the evolution of what would become such an important piece of Death and Death Metal history. Most notably, at the end of disc 2's tracks, we get a glimpse of Chuck's influences from French metal bands in 'Jon A Qua', in which Chuck sings at almost Rob Halford pitch! The booklet has some great and informative liner notes from James Murphy, Terry Butler, Michael Schon Poulsen of Volbeat and Chuck's sister, Beth Schuldiner. Also included are some great photo's from this era of Death,a very cool peliminary sketch of the album artwork and the lyrics of course. If you're big Death fan, I suggest getting the 3-Disc version at Relapse's home site, which features a live show from 1990, which has pretty ok quality(c'mon it was 1990 for cryin' out loud!), but even greater, features Pre-Human rehearsal takes, which is very interesting and cool to hear. Overall, if you're a fan of Death or Death Metal and somehow don't know or missed out on this album, here's a perfect opportunity to experience a vital part of what Death Metal is today. Let the metal Flow!tant piece of Death and Death Metal history.

B000FA5SMK|5.0|This is definitely a 5 star book.  The charactors are well developed and a lot of suspence.  DeMille has a great way with a mystery.  I would reccomend this book to anyone.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I enjoy this game.  It took quite awhile before it got too difficult for my slow reflexes - that's a good thing for an older gal.<br />I really liked it!
0425263916|5.0|This was the 2nd in the trilogy from this author; with the 1st book being Bared To You.<br />I couldn't wait to get this book, once I preordered it on Amazon.com.<br />Now I can't wait until the 3rd installment of the trilogy comes out in a couple months.<br />I have read other novels of hers, but this trilogy is by far my favorite.<br />Somewhat the same type erotic reads of the Fifty series and a definite must read if you loved those!
B005LAII1C|5.0|All the people who gave 1 star are dumb.<br /><br />I watched this movie 15 times already and I could not stop laughing (I am extremely picky about comedies). How can people say its soley about penis and fart jokes?<br /><br />Did you even watch the movie? There is maybe one or two. They aren't even that bad. I hope you never stray away from nick at nite and watch american pie.<br /><br />Sure this movie is a little adolescent but the humor is classic Macfarlane. I think its safe to say that if you like Family Guy you will like this movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you is by far the best book I have read. Comparison to the fifty shades series is not even necessary. Bared to You is such a better book. If you don't read this book you are neglecting yourself of one of the greatest books and series of all time.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This was so well done, that I am looking forward to the remaining pieces of the trilogy.  Hopefully they will come out sooner rather than later!

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a very thought provoking book.  I thoroughly enjoyed Harold's journey through life.  Although it's easy to say remember to take time to smell the roses this book is about more than that. The ending has so much more in store for the reader than one would have thought.

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Well crafted - absorbing on many levels - I would very much recommend this - I hope this will the beginning of many seasons
1594744769|5.0|This is a quirky, imaginative book suitable for middle-school aged children and young-at-heart adults.  I enjoyed the world created from a former time and appreciated the accuracy of detail.  This allowed me to accept the outrageous events that occurred therein. I would be interested in more books by this author.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I was sort of expecting something similar to traffic; violence and action.  Story line is slightly different but still shows the same thing when it comes to drugs - Mexican cartels are everywhere and everyone seems to get paid off.  Plenty of back stabbing and snitching and naturally, most get away with their crimes.  Definitely not a slow movie.  Worth watching that's for sure.

B0019K06RM|4.0|Emmylou is my number two artist (next to Bob Dylan), that I discovered many years ago when I saw The Band's film \\"The Last Waltz\\". Emmylou is the person who lead me to buy albums by the likes of Lucinda Williams, Patty Griffin, The McGarrigles, Steve Earle, Julie Miller etc, and lead me later to discover alt country. I have almost all Emmylou's albums and there's only a couple I don't play much, \\"I've Always Needed You\\" with Carl Jackson and \\"Hard Bargin\\". \\"All I Intended To Be\\" is classic Emmylou Harris. I can't think of weak song here.

0201721481|5.0|This was a prescribed book for my undergraduate C++ course 6 years ago. In all the years that have passed no other book has managed to best 'C++ Primer' in it's breadth of coverage or the treatment it gives to the most minute aspects of the language.

0062127241|4.0|Pete Townshend is the most interesting, introspective and, at times, maddening grand men of rock.  This book contains all of that: Pete the rebel, Pete the artist, Pete the carouser, Pete the grandiose and Pete the I-am-fascinated-and-obsessed-with-myself and you're welcome to hear my inner-dialogue.  I recommend this book for those interested in rock history, the Who and Townshend.  It is satisfying on many levels.<br /><br />That said, I am not sure that Townshend emerges any less inscrutable than he has always been.  He describes himself as a child, as a composer and as an artist as always standing alone, and somewhat apart.  This book confirms that because he still seems distant, which may also be why he is so compelling.<br /><br />Finally, the book could have used some of Townshend's talents as an editor at Faber and Faber.  Parts of it read like a name-dropping diary dump.  This is compelling at turns, but gets tedious too.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Like most, I think this film was very poorly served at the box office and by haters online (I'm looking at you, hostile posters on Aintitcoolnews).<br /><br />I've seen it about three times now, once in the cinema in 3d and at home on both dvd and more recently bluray. I've enjoyed it greatly each time. In particular, what struck me the last time was how well the love story between Carter and Deja Thoris is handled. There are some brilliantly touching moments, which both Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins really bring to life.<br /><br />The film has a great epic quality over all, and a fantastic look to the whole thing. I doubt there will ever be a sequel made unfortunately, because of the bean counting nature of life, but hopefully it can make its money back on dvd sales and hiring, etc. It is outrageous that dreck like Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides made so much money while John Carter tanked. It is proof that box office failure does not necessarily define what is good and what is not.

B0098VYKSA|5.0|The previews made us want to watch this movie. Turns out to be a very good movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Neither Amazon HD nor VUDU HD titles can be played on the ROKU2 XS device unless you bumb-down the audio format on the ROKU from 5.1 Surround to stereo - which takes away from the movie.<br /><br />The movie was far better than we thought it would be (despite the down-graded audio)!

B00571F26Y|5.0|Loved this book. Amazed at the harm wheat can do to one. My son has also gone wheat free. Feeling great. Wheat just isn't what it was doing Biblical times......AND we don't live as long now as then!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie the whole family got into it love the storyline the music the characters the whole thing
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Read this because movie previews looked interesting and now it's one of my all time favorite books.  Beautifully written, combining humor, adventure and philosophy.  Mostly humor and adventure. The movie previews are a little deceiving.  And it was just hard to put it down once I started it.  I've been recommending it to all of my friends and family.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Exciting story lines great special effects characters revolt developed we enjoy this movie. Have highly recommended it to my friends
B0041KVW2K|1.0|The new Beatles remastered box set is a huge disappointment.<br />The only acceptable release should be from the ORIGINAL MASTER TAPES PERIOD.<br />The 2009 Cd's IMO were slightly better than the 1987 issues.<br />When is EMI going to do the right thing for the greatest rock band of all time.<br />I would like to see George and Giles Martin heading the reissues.<br />Yes George's hearing is not as good as it was once but I would take George<br />Martins ears over just about anyone.<br />Evelyn Glennie is stone deaf and she is one of the great percussionists in the world.<br />Please for the sake of the human race let's put pressure on EMI to go back to the analog<br />masters and give us that. Comparing the Yellow Submarine songtracks from 1999 which they<br />remixed and remastered from the original master tapes and hear the difference. Not perfect<br />but really really good. Also fans deserve premium pressings from a world class pressing plant!!!!

I would actually say that she uses this for \\"make-believe\\" barbie play more than she uses the 4 foot tall barbie house we have. It's great!

B006LSZECO|5.0|Told in alternating chapters from the viewpoints of the two main characters, and alternating chapters between (at first) past and present and (then later), between present and present gave this book an unusual structure that was well-suited to the tale told. I love the puzzle pieces inexorably assembled and cunningly revealed. This book got me hooked from the first and never let go. Buy it!

B0091THRCU|5.0|This is an update to my review from last year. Months after I had made this purcahse and wrote this review I was contacted by the manufacturer, unsolicited I might add, and told that I had previously received a defective case. I was asked if I would be willing to receive a complimentary replacement sleeve and reconsider my review. I said of course. I received the sleeve this week case and can report that this is the case I was hoping to get when I first made the purchase. It is still tight - nothing like before however - but the phone comes out easily enough and I imagine it will lossen just a bit over time. The phone is completely enclosed by the sleeve and the case is slim and low profile; the best I have found for this type of sleeve case. I am impressed by the manufacturer's willingness to make this right. For this you get five stars.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I just received this sleeve and (a) it is far too tight to use in any practical manner, (b) it is so tight the strap will not eject the iPhone 5 and (c) the iPhone does not go all the way into the case, sticking a good 1/4 inch or more out. By far the most disappointing item I have bought off Amazon. Will return tomorrow.

B001395L06|5.0|All you need to know about this movie is Ridley Scott directed it and Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington starred. Great acting, great story, great film. Sometimes a movie will end and you wish it would keep going. This is the movie that keeps going. It does a great job at depicting the criminal godfather and the law enforcement agents who pursue him. Buy this movie, settle in and watch what I think is a perfect movie. You can even watch it online:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00174TKGI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00174TKGI&linkCode=as2&tag=coloradosportsguys-20
030758836X|1.0|While the beginning of the book did draw me in and I read this in one sitting just to find out how it ended.  The ending completely killed the book for me.  It left me with no rooting interest in any of the characters, good or bad.  I was completely let down but the unrealistic choices all the characters made or were left with.  I wish the final 1/3 was a good as the previous 2/3.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game  is alot of fun. You sling-shot your bird at targets and each level gets tougher. However be warned, this game is addicting, you'll spend hours playing.
1449410243|1.0|After having said that, I have to say my age and experience has colored my views.  Recently, I saw a few quick bits from &#34;Laugh In&#34;, which was hysterical in the 60's and was leading edge in double entendre at the time.  Guess what?  It is no longer funny to me, just dumb and juvenile.  Therefore, if you are a 20 something, or maybe even a 30 something, and are of the male pursuasion, it is possible you might find this book humorous.  I did not.  . There were one or two chuckles, but mostly from embarrassment.  I guess I am too old for this book. ( I hated  the movie &#34;The Bridesmaids&#34; too.)<br />Cat M. class of 67'

B0050DZ8J0|3.0|A little better navigation, and an easy way to export contacts would be welcomed on this platform, and the others!  Otherwise, a much more comfortable way to get things done while relaxing in front of the television than having my laptop in front of me!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I could have done without knowing so often how he smelled and how he tasted and blah, blah, yuk... But I'm a guy. Keeping in mind that this was written from/for a women's Point Of View, it is incredibly well written and engaging, to say the least. Well rounded book, will definitely recommend. (To women).

0425263916|5.0|I loved this book. If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey  then you will LOVE this and all of Sylvia Day's other books. It is definetely a sultry love story about Gideon and Eva. Great read and great book.It will not disappoint you.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Plant/page tours were nostalgic back in the 90s. But this was true Led Zeppelin at its finest. Robert Plant allowed the Golden God to return for one incredible night, and he sang true to form, catching all the nuances on each track as they were recorded so long ago. Jimmy Page has always contained his greatness, but this concert showed what a well-rehearsed maestro can do at any age. His timing was dead-on, and his solos had a precision that was missing in earlier reunion efforts.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|good book it would be better if these books<br />did not cost so much particularly when they are<br />e-books. This needs to change.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I read the Kindle version.  I would get lost with all the switching around of countries and characters...I did like the way the author shows the connections between people.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This album is awesome. I like every single song. They all have great lyrics; 50 ways to say good-bye is so funny, specially the &#34;crappy purple scion&#34;. And who can resist Merrmaid?  Bruises is my current favorite from this album...

0345803507|5.0|I love the international scenery, i love this book, i absolutely love how it ends. This trilogy is everything I needed in my normal life. It took me away from my reality and allowed me to live through the eyes of Anastasia Rose Steele. It took me a bit longer to get through the third book, because it dragged for a while, but it was all worth it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like this game. More of a brain teased than Angry Birds since you need to figure out how to build the cart to advance to the next game. There are special awards for each game too.
0345803493|5.0|I loved everything about the second book. It is absolutely a page turner. The drama, the surprises, the gasping moments, the romance that is now exuding out of Grey...die for him btw!! i am absolutely obsessed with this trilogy. Thank you EL James!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|while i consider myself a real Jack Reached fan (read 'em all), this was verrry boring and predictable. hard to write anything exciting when most of the &#34;action&#34; takes place with the main characters riding in a car. disappointing at best.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|OK so I got the FREE game and after like 2 min. it just stopped and said you want to<br />keep playing? then you can purchase this. unless you that to happen. Go ahead:)  (just warning you!!)
B0076DCT2G|4.0|as i read this book, i was amazed at the real life changes our world has gone through. the day to day grind sometimes dulls our senses to the subtle changes in our lives due to 9/11. the book is a really good read, but i kept coming back to the way everyday life has changed forever. God Bless all the families that lost a loved one on 9/11, and God Bless America.
B009D7CP2M|1.0|OK, maybe I am not the best person to be reviewing books.  I read a lot, but I love to read to be either informed, or for entertainment.  Why do people write books like this???  Unless this would be informative from a psychiatrist's point of view (then I would know up front I would never read it), then there is no  point in reading this.  Just an author who is trying to impress us with verbose language droning on and on in the form of one-sided letters.  This is kind of like most of the \\"entertainment\\" on TV these days which isn't entertaining either.  Skip this one!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I hear of it from my best friend and I downloaded it and loved it  its a very fun game i loved it i hope you love it to
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Can we say frustrating!?!? I went back and forth throughout majority of the book thinking I had it figured out. Great book.
B007C52NY2|5.0|Before 50 Shades of Grey, there were Stieg Larsson's triology books which are much more interesting, exciting and indepth research performed by the author.  Outstanding reading !
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love how crazy everybody is in this book.  I could never stay on one person's side for to long.
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|At first I was a little worried, the song \\"Diamonds\\" was not a favorite at first. I really enjoyed this album and I hope that others decide to take a listen. It is truly done in Rihanna fashion...unapologetic! Very in your face, I love the way she takes chances with her music.
1603427244|5.0|This book is simple yet thorough.  It has very clear pictures and instructions. Each technique clearly lists what situations it works best for based on characteristics of the cast-on or bind-off. The spiral bound spine means the book stays open while your hands are knitting, without awkward balancing. I recommend this for any knitter's library, beginner to experienced.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I am loving this series. It seems like its a step up from the Percy Jackson series for sure (which I also loved) And as an Ancient Egypt fan (more than Greece, even, which I also quite adore) I am happy to see him cover the pantheon.
B009ZWON02|5.0|WHAT A VOICE THALIA!! HABITAME SIEMPRE IS A 100% HIT!!! FROM THE 1 SONG TO 12TH SONG U WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP HEARIN IT! LIKE ME IV BEEN RE PLAYIN IT OVER & OVER!! SO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO WORTH IT BIG TIME
B00280LYIC|5.0|Purchase this book. This book is soooooooooooooo amazing you have to read it over and over. Buy this book right now.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Love this new album. Good new sound with Pinks style in tact.  There are a couple songs I don't love, but still like.  Just wish I wouldn't have bought the explicit version. I never get to listen to it because I've always got kids in the car.  Next time ill pay attention to what I'm doing.
B00846REIS|5.0|I must say after reading fifty shades of grey and then reading Bared to you, it did feel a little too similar in some ways but over all I felt it was a great book and I have already finished the second one as well. The only thing I find disapointing is having to wait for it to come out. I know that may seem selfish but I hate to put down a book and have to wait months or weeks for the next one. I think they should have waited and released them all at the same time. Just my personal opinion. But I did love the book for sure.
0446547654|4.0|I just finished this book, and it was not what I was expecting.  It was very good, but not like his other works I have read.
B007BVT5N4|3.0|Cute but short and not what I expected....nowhere near first step to forever....the first job book was brilliant....a real keeper
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Not worth your time.  It even gets boring towards the end.  The cinematography is dark, and this movie just really makes you want to take a nap.
B009186E3O|5.0|I have been collecting records since the summer of 1965 which coincidentally is just about the time that The Rolling Stones were in Dublin, Ireland playing before a frenzied audience of teenagers at the Adelphi Theater.  Down through the decades it has always been my contention that The Rolling Stones made their very best music during their days at London Records in the 1960's.  So when offered the chance to take a look at the new box set from Abkco \\"The Rolling Stones: Charlie Is My Darling -- Ireland 1965\\"  I jumped at it. This unique package features the long-forgotten 65 minute film by Peter Whitehead \\"Charley Is My Darling\\" which was recorded in its entirety during that marvelous summer weekend so many years ago.  The footage has been lovingly restored and both DVD and Blu-ray versions are included.  Also featured are two marvelous audio CD's, a 10\\" vinyl album, a colorful replica tour poster and an amazing 44 page hardcover book with sensational photos, newspaper clippings and the narrative of just went down that weekend. Trust me, if you are a fan of the band this one is a keeper!<br /><br />For me the most surprising thing about this package was the film.  Ordinarily, I am not a big fan of this sort of thing but I found \\"Charlie Is My Darling\\" to be quite entertaining indeed.  It was fun watching the boys as they traverse the Irish countryside on a train enroute to their gig in Dublin.  As you might expect Mick Jagger has some very interesting things to say and there are numerous opportunities for the other band members to chime in as well.  It is amazing to me that even at this very early stage of their career how little privacy the guys have and they talk about that.  There are interesting shots of the Irish countryside as the train chugs along and they are plenty of shots of the boys horsing around.  Lots of fun!  But clearly the best part of \\"Charlie Is My Darling\\" is the footage from the concert.  The raw energy is simply unbelievable!  See if you agree.<br /><br />Now I would certainly concur with another reviewer who felt that the \\"two audio CD's are the real gem here\\".  These discs are positively out of this world.  Disc One is the soundtrack from the film and features \\"live\\" versions of such Rolling Stones classics as \\"Pain In My Heart\\",  \\"The Last Time\\", \\"Time Is On My Side\\" and of course \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" which was riding high on the charts all over the world when the film was being made.  Also feature in the soundtrack are the original studio recordings of \\"Heart of Stone\\" and \\"Play With Fire\\".  Meanwhile, there are a number of other terrific tunes in this 22 song soundtrack.  Among my favorites is the boys doing an impromptu version of an old London folk anthem \\"Maybe It's Because I'm A Londoner\\" which was a big hit in England in the late 1940's.  The second audio disc \\"The Rolling Stones Live In England '65\\" features a bakers dozen of outstanding performances from the group's performances in their native land during that incredible year.  There are some really interesting tunes on this one including the band's take on such diverse tunes as Willie Dixon's \\"Little Red Rooster\\", Hank Snow's \\"I'm Moving On\\" and of all things Bobby Troup's great jazz standard \\"Route 66\\".  Who'da thunk it?<br /><br />The bottom line here is that the \\"Charlie Is My Darling:  Ireland 1965\\" box set is outstanding in every way.  It is clear to me that a lot of thought and love went into producing this package.  This is a collection that can be enjoyed by fans of the band, collectors and general audiences alike.  Furthermore, due to the historical significance of this box set I am quite sure that many of these will wind up in libraries as well.  Very highly recommended!.<br /><br />Now I would certainly concur with another reviewer who felt that the \\"two audio CD's are the real gem here\\".  These discs are positively out of this world.

1423140605|5.0|I really loved this book because the author really brought the characters together. I liked all the action and conflict in the story. I would recommend this to people who like fun stories with a twist and Greek mythology.
B009P5S11G|1.0|I really like Rihana and bought all her cd's.They are quite good.However,i don't know<br />what she was doing when she made this one.It simply not worth the money.
B005PK56TA|4.0|An entertaining series, every episode features a different period (and creepy story) in the history of a haunted house. Not a bad choice if you're looking to veg out in front of the tube for an hour.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|After a very long wait in my rental queue, I finally got a chance to see this much hyped film, but now I wish I had bought it. 20 or so cops enter a building full of the worst scum and have to fight there way through hundreds of bad guys to reach the boss on the top floor. Simple, yet executed to perfection. Basically the same concept as Dredd 3-D which came out this year. There is an insane amount of carnage on display. Gun fights, knife fights, machete fights and some of the best hand to hand fights ever. To top it all off the acting was very good and the subtitles don't get in the way because there is very little talking to begin with. Even the majority of critics couldn't resist this film and if you are of the male gender, your jaw will be on the floor.
B008966SLM|4.0|One of those CDs I will listen to many times over the coming years!  Especailly love Sadder Days and Blues Get Off My Shoulder.
0156027321|3.0|Well, I enjoyed the first part of the book in India and the ocean survival part of the story was OK.  But if the last part of this book had been condensed to a few pages it would have been far superior.  Instead, the author feels the need to bludgeon the reader over the head again and again by explaining the meaning of every detail of the allegory he has just read.  Because the reader is clearly too stupid to get it.  Sorry, I got it, and it would have been much more powerful if you had let it stand on its own merits.  One of the great things about art is ability for different people to interpret it differently.  Instead, in the last act the author effectively removes any artistic merit that the book might have had.  Sometimes less is more.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Best-fitting headphones I've found.  Not in stores that I know of, so I usually order a batch so I'll have replacements when they eventually die.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Killer App. Always there when you need it, and works flawlessly. Gave it four stars because the sound quality could be a little better. Other than that. Great.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I was never a comic fan of some of these characters, but I was into Iron Man and Captain America. Their respective movies were good, but the Avengers is great! The dynamics among the different characters is artful and believable and the cast did an amazing job. Coupled with the stellar CGI, this makes for an outstanding movie experience.  I highly recommend it.

B005LAIHZE|5.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter keeps to known history of President Lincoln while adding a fun and action packed flair. There is plenty of action and a little splash of romance. The ending is a little sad, as it must be, but in that there is hope. I highly recommend this movie to those who both love Lincoln and Vampires. It's a surprisingly good combination.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Yes it is expensive. Even with a $10 price drop, it was still pricey. Especially considering most Lego sets are sold by the pound of plastic (piece count), this one is really expensive. But how in the world could I not see the happy expression on my sons' face each day as they opened a door and pulled out some Star Wars character or model? Yes they are 16 and 21, so maybe Dad is enjoying the daily door opening too.<br /><br />No, I bought this because I bought the 2011 Star Wars advent calendar that was just plain wonderful fun. This one is equally wonderful. I did like Yoda Santa last year; Darth Maul Santa is nearly not fun so much. Yes, I'll admit, I'm addicted to these calendars.<br /><br />It appears Lego manufactured more than enough sets this year. The sets are still available at Lego. Most years by this time these sets have sold out and the Amazon sellers reap huge profits. Not so this year. I guess the hugely in demand version is the Lego Friends, purple set.<br /><br />If you love your advent calendar more Christmas-like, then the City 2012 advent calendar is probably a better choice. But if you want to hear your children make fun pew pew pew noises (or you'd like to make them yourself), this is the right calendar to buy.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007Q0OF9E LEGO 2012 City Advent Calendar 4428]]
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Lately, Grisham's works have seem a little ordinary. The Racketeer provides different and more interesting perspectives and procedures than many of his previous novels. It was a most entertaining read although the first 50 pages may seem a little dull.

B000024JEX|1.0|i've been a fan of keith jarrett's since hearing him play back up on charles lloyd's 1967 \\"forest flower\\" album.  i loved being there when jarrett lead a trio at the village vanguard a year or two later.  and i've loved a lot of his music over the years since, including some of the work he's done with peacock and dejohnette. for example, [a piece i used to associate with ahmad jamal] poinciana, on the cd \\"whisper not\\" just knocks me out. but much this blue note collection leaves me cold.  the musicians sound tired. the music sounds tired.<br /><br />a lot of reviewers here love it, so maybe it's just me.  but i thought someone might want to save their money and, e.g., buy \\"whisper not.\\"<br /><br />edit: apparently only positive reviews are \\"helpful\\" here.  i love jarrett but was very disappointed by this rather staid set of recordings.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved this book.  I really like the Percy and Jason Series from Riordan.  Well developed characters. Finding trouble all the way to the end. Cant wait to see how they finish their latest adventure.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I received this CD as a gift and although I don't love every track it is worth having just for O come Emanuel.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love that I finally have a app for Pinterest! So much easier than searching for the website each time! Works great!
B004HY3BU6|5.0|While porn is not necessarily the best thing, the adult industry has been instrumental in many monumental events/actions.  Larry Flynt, while abhorrant, set the stage for free speech with his parodies of famous people.  The movie is well done, and is great to watch.  And, it IS a history/civics lesson believe it or not!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I normally love These &#34;team&#34; themed films, like &#34;Alien&#34;, &#34;The Abyss&#34;, &#34;Jurassic Park&#34;, etc.<br /><br />This was a lame movie.  I paid $4 to watch it (the price of a well cocktail lol) this movie, and I lost interest at about minute 10.
B00664AM5C|5.0|The director took an old subject and made it very compelling, and easy to watch and understand.  His surprise of holding back Day 1 was keen, and added immensely to the movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is an excellent adaptation of the book. The scenes, background, costumes and especially the actors represent the book very well. I really enjoyed watching what I had read. There were a few scenes not in the book, but you could still see it fitting with what was in the book. Highly recommended.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all John Grisham's books. I think this was the best one so far.<br />I will be waiting for the next one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really didn't expect to like this book, but love John Grisham's other books so thought I would give it a try.  Couldn't put it down!!  Was completly surprised by the ending!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|What?! Who wrote this?! Who directed it?! Who paid to have it made and why haven't they been fired?!<br /><br />Movie starts out with Lincoln as a child who stands up for his friend (a free slave) being captured in the North and sent to the South. Turns out the slave traders are vampires sending slaves South for dinner. The traders take revenge on Lincoln's family by killing Abe's mother while she sleeps. He grows up and seeks revenge, but ends up almost dying when he takes on the vampire who killed his mom. The guy that saves him also trains him by teaching him how to chop down a tree with his rage in one swipe. Later Abe discovers the guy who trained him is a vampire. It gets worse. Somehow Vampires end up playing a piviotal role in the Civil War. The only way to stop them is to melt down all the silverware in the North to arm troops at Gettysburg so they can kill the vampire soldiers who are helping the South fight the war.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Alot of hype about Licoln lately, but this was entertaining...I like how they tied it to history.  Better than most other zombie /vampire movies out lately.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I've read a lot of fantasy,mythology, syfy in my many years. This show encompasses it all in an all new twist.
B00887490Y|1.0|Review contains spoilers-Who are these people giving it three stars and above? This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just absolutely senseless, and honestly kind of insulting. This movie grows increasingly ludicrous as it goes on, starting of as a fairly interesting thrilling, and then it is revealed that the \\"Tall Man\\" is actually a small group of people kidnapping children from people they have deemed to be unfit parents, and then miraculously placing them in wealthy homes. At the end we see a few clips of these \\"rescued\\" kids enjoying their new found upper class existence, while their real parents are left devastated. After all of that the movie tries to paint the kidnappers as martyrs to their cause, when they are really monsters. This was a truly bizarre movie.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I enjoyed the first book of this trilogy, but I didn't even finish this one.  I read most of it, but then another book caught my eye and I have not bothered to finish Winter of the World.  It may be of more interest to someone who did not live through this period.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Complete page turner.....read it in 2 days.  Grisham is a master storyteller and this is one of his best.  I sent the Kindle version to all my siblings!
B00006HBUA|5.0|No problems playing, loved the widescreen presentation, and a great price. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who loves Scooby-Doo.
B009B53LA6|3.0|No Doubt reunited for this?  Not a whole lot impressive here.  Looks like No Doubt has lost their groove... hope they find it again, but not on this one.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|When we tried to play the DVD it would never play past the introduction so we returned it for a refund
B008JGSM6G|5.0|An easy to learn puzzle game, with a nice selection of play modes to suit your mood.  You can relax with the puzzles or challenge yourself with a timed mode.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|This game is very poorly designed.  It is nearly impossible to build some of the formations as an adult, much less a 6 year old!  The asteroid is too heavy and knocks everything down, the planks do not balance at all like shown in the pictures.  Fun for kids to play with by building their own castles and knocking them down, but the game is a waste and very frustrating.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|great game, wonderful graphics. kept me on my toes...yes, you go back and forth quite alot but for me thats what made it interesting. it would have been nice to point at a location on the map rather than manually going back but not really that big of a deal. well worth the cost...cant wait for the sequel.
B006LSZECO|5.0|why did it end? I had a hard time putting this down. Every page had a twist to it. Why did it have to end?
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever it always will keep you on your toes. I really say you should beg this
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Nice, but you have to both calibrate &amp; work through the tutorials to enjoy.  DON'T try to just jump in &amp; play.

B009RWPAA2|5.0|I just got my vinyl copy in the mail today and it is beautiful! Gatefold 1 LP Set w lyric sheet and that awsome color waves like pic when u open it. It is a 140 gm vinyl (they had a tiny 1500 copy pressing on clear vinyl exclusive to Hot Topic) black record that sound amazing if not better than the vinyl of Diamonds Eyes. the songs follow in the same vein as D.E. but w a lil more soft ambience to them. i am in love w Tracks 1 thru 9 and the last 2 are ok, i am more an album person than tracks so they flow nicely into the theme of the album as a whole but dont quite standout to me at least.Which is funny cause an ok Deftones song is better in quality n lyrics than most bands best songs but anyway, put ur headphones on hit play and listen to this collection of songs take you on a romantic, atmospheric journey thru a story of where Deftones are at in their lives and the sound of a band that gets better n better w each passing album! A+
B004QX07G4|5.0|Beware reading it on a metro, train, plane, or other public place.  You will laugh like I did and embarrass yourself.

0316017930|4.0|A: I hadn't considered all the facts and random coincidences that surround the lives of the famous or \\"geniuses\\". That was really helpful to learn and it forced me to think more critically about things. However, it left me feeling kind of empty on the application side. I have been informed, but I didn't feel like I was led to do anything with the information. Except maybe that I need to practice more to be successful. J  I also didn't like his statement at the end. It implied that what everyone wants in life is to be able to afford their big house and live comfortably. I also think happiness is more than that, but maybe I didn't understand the book right. What were your thoughts reading it?<br /><br />S: I read this book because it is a very popular one. I thought it was an entertaining read. It already has 1477 reviews on Amazon, for instance, and is #198 on the best seller list although it has been out for years. It is #1 in cultural anthropology and (interestingly!) #3 in mathematics.<br /><br />One more spiritual application is that we shouldn't live life focused on the \\"me\\" story, as time and chance happen to us all, and all is a chasing after the wind. Instead, we should focus on the bigger story, that revolves around the master, not around any of his servants, whether they are diligent, lucky, or both.<br /><br />Still like you, I was disappointed as I think most anyone would agree that people who have unusual success often live at the corner of passionate pursuit and crazy coincidence. Perhaps it's a good reminder though that this is the case, and there is also room for many other journeys, even if they don't include comfort and success. Bill Gates began with great comfort and success, yet his passionate pursuit raised things to a new level (at the intersection of focused pursuit and crazy luck!)<br /><br />My two takeaways--I shouldn't expect to do something really well unless I invest a lot of time in it, and investing a lot of time in something is no guarantee I will succeed compared to others. This certainly applies to work, mission, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />Regarding happiness, some studies suggest that there are two major sources of happiness--momentary entertainment and lasting significance. We probably all would prefer to have some of each, but a life without lasting significance might be at best only a glass \\"half full!\\" Perhaps it's the other way around as well.antee I will succeed compared to others.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another John Grisham \\"Hard to Put Down Book\\"! Easy to follow the different characters as they are weaved in and out of the story...Never would have guessed the ending!
0316212377|4.0|Iain M Banks' Culture novels have been around for 25 years now.  Given Mr. Banks propensity for experimenting with the form and content of the things, they've been a bit hit and miss... though given his skill as an author, even the misses are thought provoking and well worth reading.  The Hydrogen Sonata is at the faster paced, lighter end of the spectrum and I had a rollicking good time reading it.  The title doesn't have a lot to do with the content,  the heroine seems to be a pawn, the Minds remain inscrutable, the ending is morally ambiguous, and you can't help wondering while you read it if the chief protagonists are all in pursuit of a MacGuffin - but the action set pieces are fantastic, the environments epic and the themes of the nature of Memory, Machiavelli and Truth suitably imponderable.  In short, a Culture novel.  If you haven't read one before... choose some of the earlier stuff to get started on.  If you have, then you know more or less what you're in for.
030758836X|4.0|This book kept me guessing and turning the pages.  I enjoyed it- even when I didn't like any of the characters.  Ultimately, it's an easy read that doesn't require much thought or hold hidden meanings.  Would recommend it!
B003UESJJC|5.0|There is nothing I can say about this brilliant film that has not been said before. The scrpt and the cast were superb.<br />Sam Bottoms, you are missed.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|In interest of full disclosure, before you read this review, I should mention that I am featured in a chapter and mentioned elsewhere, and that Tim is a friend of mine. Having said that, both the review and the book are worth reading.<br /><br />No, to business: the 4-Hour Chef is described as a cookbook for people who don't buy cookbooks. I would say that is a slight misnomer, especially in my case. For me, it's been a cookbook for people who don't USE cookbooks.<br /><br />I buy plenty of cookbooks, generally those that are written by celebrity chefs and pertain to either steak or cake, these being the two foods I most enjoy eating (and don't even get me started on a cake made of steak--I hope that's Tim's next project). I read them and enjoy them, but I almost never USE them. If I get one usable recipe out a cookbook, it's a lot. Still, I never consider it money wasted, because cookbooks like nice on the shelf, and to me books are as much for decoration as they for utility and pleasure.<br /><br />Tim's book serves all three of these purposes.<br /><br />Unlike most cookbooks that just give you ingredients and directions, the 4-Hour Chef doen'st just TELL you how to took; it TEACHES you how to cook. Since getting the book two weeks ago (advance review copy, I have made three recipes: the salt baked sweet potatoes (easy and delish), the go-carb yeast waffles (holy crap amazing) and the bacon infused bourbon (had to. as good as it sounds). Of course, my copy is now getting beat up and has a few stains on it, but, you know, that's the price of glory and all.<br /><br />I decided to actually try these recipes because not only was there progression in terms of difficulty, but because Tim actually explained the science of how they were made; learning about everything infusion to gels to powders--this is the stuff that made me WANT to try these recipes. Of course, they all looked and sounded delicious, but I really just enjoyed the process of learning.<br /><br />And that's what 4HC is really about: learning. And more specifically, learning how to learn. Learning the skill of learning skills; or, as Tim dubs it, \\"meta-learning.\\"<br /><br />If you're familiar with Tim's work, you know that cooking isn't his thing. And if you read the 4-Hour Workweek and the 4-Hour Body, you know that neither task and time management or fitness are really his \\"thing\\" either; he wrote about those things BECAUSE of his thing: breaking down complex skills and learning them quickly.<br /><br />As I see it, the 4 Hour Chef is Tim at his most \\"naked.\\" Since 2007, when 4HWW came out, we've heard Tim talk about learning tango in 4 weeks, or learning how to swim, competing and medaling in Chinese kickboxing with very little time to train--or any of the other accomplishments that he's become well known for. But we've never SEEN him learn these thing in real time; we always get the stories long after the fact.<br /><br />While all of the feats in both 4HWW and 4HB are impressive by any measure, there is something very different in this book. In the 4-Hour Workweek, Tim was focusing on his job. While he wrote some revolutionary stuff, ultimately you'd EXPECT a Princeton grad to be smart and good at his job. In the 4-Hour Body, Tim is writing about fitness, a hobby of his for nearly 20 years. Again, some very smart and revolutionary stuff in there, but after 20 years, you would expect him to know what he's talking about.<br /><br />That's what makes 4HC completely different: Tim is learning as we learn.<br /><br />Prior to this book, Tim was not a cook. It's not even that he wasn't a \\"good cook\\" -- he just didn't cook at all. (Evidence: his youtube video of making eggs in a microwave.)<br /><br />At 34-years old, Ferriss went into this project with NO skills--and in about 6 months, came out on the other side of the ordeal being more proficient in the kitchen than many people are after 20 years of cooking for their families. I'm sure Tim isn't a master chef, buthe learned an incredibly complex series of skills and built his proficiency to a high level in a very short period of time. And that, after all, if his THING.<br /><br />For the first time, Tim isn't just telling stories; he's taking the reader along for the ride. And because he wants the reader to be able to do what he does and learn as he learns, the first part of the book gets you read to do exactly what he does: learn.<br /><br />The first section of 4HC is called \\"META\\" and in that section reveals his strategies for learning, and creates and lays out an entire framework for learning any skill or becoming extremely proficient at just about anything in six months. Whether it's shooting hoops or speaking Spanish--yes--learning to cook, the section on Meta-learning along is worth the price of the book. And, in fact, is the real POINT of the book.<br /><br />From my perspective, cooking is the vehicle of demonstration; it's the particular skillset that Tim chose to illustrate both meta-learning and it's benefits. The recipes are fantastic, the skills he covers are valuable, and the education in the culinary arts and culinary world are invaluable. So it the nutrition information.<br /><br />But learning. Learning is where it's at.<br /><br />And this book will help you learn anything. But first, you must learn how to learn.<br /><br />If you haven't already picked this up, do so. It's worth the read, worth the time, and certainly worth the money.he learned an incredibly complex series of skills and built his proficiency to a high level in a very short period of time.

B0000039LE|5.0|The film arrived in excellent condition with no shipping or payment problems.  It was technically flawless and I thoroughly enjoyed viewing it.  One of my all-time favorites, and the first film to employ the steadycam.  Thank you!
B00003CX96|5.0|This is quite simply one of my favorite movies of all time. And I still shriek with laughter every time I see the father's face after he sees his son shaving his legs.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Having read of the abuses and cruelty of the orphanages and &#34;work&#34; houses when they were first disclosed in the early 90s, this was a horror story of a compilation of stories of such cruelty that it's a miracle that any of those children have not been affected.  Although the story ends with a pleasant resolution, this reader was shocked by the fact that no penalties have been inflicted upon those responsible for these sins against those who had no recourse.  The Catholic Church has much for which to answer, but, as I understand it, the punishment has not yet been imposed.  Shame! Shame!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It would have been easy to write this book without all the details and sub-plots. It just wouldn't have been written by King.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I like this game. it has yet to dissapoint me and that's saying something. I will be looking for more games like this one
B004D1AIZ4|5.0|My review is specific to the Kindle Fire version (Fire bought in Dec 2011). The visual quality is o.k. for the most part albeit with some pixelation-like effects in some of the forest scenes. The film itself is the full-length 207 minute version (which includes an intermission) with sub-titles.<br />If, like me, you are interested in this film because it's a classic, you know the basic story line but haven't seen it before then by all means get the movie & watch it. Then read a couple of intelligent reviews of it, read the Wikipedia page on Seven Samurai & watch it again.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This app is fun for all ages. I love to play it and so does my 9 year old. It has some very good songs
184195392X|5.0|Wonderful story of a boy and a tiger stranded together in a lifeboat at sea after a shipwreck.<br />The knowledge of animals was interesting and the survival skills that a 16 year old would possess<br />at such a young age are remarkable.  The boy and animal can't live together, but strangely, also can't survive<br />without one another.  A magical tale that you never want to end.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|We thought the second season was quite slow....we are all for character development, but...let's be honest...it's a zombie flick...you want those terrifying moments more often than not. We felt last season lacked in that department.<br />Season 3 has had a great pace to it so far...lots of action and surprises!
B009P5S11G|3.0|Good album, but not Rihanna's best. The (good) songs definitely took some time to grow on me.<br /><br />Top songs:<br /><br />What Now - 10/10 *my favorite*<br />Right Now - 9/10<br />Lost In Paradise - 9/10<br />Pour It Up - 8/10<br />Jump - 8/10<br />Stay - 8/10<br />LWT/Mother Mary - 8/10<br />No Love Allowed - 8/10
1469984202|5.0|Can you give something 6 stars?  Like turn it up to 11?  This is easily the best sci fi series I've read in 15 years.  I picked up the Omnibus after looking up another favorite author, Neal Stephenson, and haven't been able to put it down; the Tivo is starting to fill up.  The price was right and I fully support the \\"little guy\\" publishing his own work.<br /><br />The premise from the first book is a meme changer - similar to The Matrix (first movie only) - but the real strength is the depth of the characters without repetition.  You get a good sense of the motives, history, and emotions of the characters without unnecessary filler.  I felt that the pace of the reveal was perfect.  When the story split to multiple POVs in book 5, I was torn between reading linearly and flipping from POV to POV to stay with my favorite characters.  The last time I had such difficulty putting down a book was while reading Raymond Feist's first 12 books or so on the Riftwar.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to continuing the series and I'm thrilled that there are several new books in the series to read.  Could Hugh be the next Louis Lamour?  He certainly seems prolific enough a writer to keep his audience entertained (unlike #cough#WheelOfTimeSeries#cough# - even before Robert Jordan passed away RIP.)

B009E3EXMU|5.0|I won't bore you with waxing poetic. The band is tight and the songs represent a fantastic time for rock/world music. Robert's phrasing and rhythmic play enliven the songs. John Paul Jones adds (many) inventive ideas. Jason just outright slams plus Jimmy plays in a most tasteful manner. What a great night and what a true gift for us all. Tour or (as it looks) no tour we have a fantastic bookend for our collection. All hail the mighty Zeppelin.

In retrospect, I feel this book was written for the younger generation; however, all can learn a lesson from this amazing story - makes me want to run to the movies upon its' release. I will try to be more aware of my surroundings, my fellow human beings and all God's creatures as Pi.

B000FC1HQY|5.0|Fuller's account of her upbringing in Africa is the story of a white Rhodesian family as their status changes that of white rulers to that of an often dispised minority in a place with a new name.  The parents and children are remarkable people, who hang on to some beliefs and prejudices while other attitudes change as they struggle to confront and adapt to a changing reality.  This is not game park, dancing Africa and the protagonists are not PC .  But despite it all they retain a deep attachment to Africa.

I know it wasn't the carrier's fault as I purchased about 7 or 8 other blu rays in the same amazon order & box - all were in perfect condition.<br /><br />The back of the box is unfortunately where the glossy godfather linear notes booklet is contained - one of the corners was completed folded in half beyond repair.  Both top and bottom of the glossy notes, as well as the box itself were beat up 'almost' to the point of being ripped.  They can't be creased back into shape.  The plastic case insert holding the godfather 3 blu had been torn off the hinge.  Luckily the discs themselves appear fine.<br /><br />I got this at the current discounted price of $19.99 but, it's the principle of the purchase..  A brand new product should not be in this condition.  If I bought this used from an ebay seller I'd almost give negative feedback based in the condition of this box, let alone a brand new sealed set of blu rays direct from amazon.com.<br /><br />I know I could probably seek replacement through amazon but, without being intimate with the process, I'm guessing I'd have to send it back, and wait for a new one.  I'm in Australia so the process would probably take a month in shipping time back and forth - for a $20 purchase, I just can't be bothered.  However, for note amazon : pick up the Quality Control of your products before shipping please.  New.. = new condition.  A real let down and disappointment on what is otherwise one of the best blu ray releases ever - one that I should have been able to cherish with pride of place on the shelf, with the rest of my 1000 strong collection of blu rays!  Not some beat up second-hand-looking cardboard box..
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved all three! What hot love story! Read them once and had to read them again! And thinking about reading them again!
B0029XFNA8|5.0|I own both the B&W blu ray and the 2006 colorised/b&w dvd.  I haven't yet watched the dvd versions so, won't comment on those yet..  However, I watched the blu ray last night and have to say the studio has done a wonderful job transferring this spectacular and heartwarming film to blu ray.  I didn't notice one instance of the picture feeling too 'dark', nor does this blu ray contain a single nick, scratch or 'line' on the image.  It has been cleaned and touched up beautifully for the blu ray release.  My TV has been professionally calibrated, which also helps!<br /><br />Sound on the blu ray is great too.  Of course for a movie of 1947 the sound is going to be very 'mono'-like but, there wasn't a hint of treble 'harshness' that you hear from so many of these old movies transferred to dvd & blu ray.  It was smooth, and vocals were clear and crisp.  Full marks on this front.<br /><br />I actually bought both the colorised (2006) dvd, as well as the blu ray(the blu being b&w only) - this was because independent web reviews indicate the colorisation of this movie was actually very good!  I'm yet to watch the color version but will post a review on that as well when I see it.  Both are on amazon and both are very cheap so, I'd recommend buying both!  You can't beat this wonderful movie in colorised version (so I've been told!)  B&W on the blu ray is beautiful for the purists but, having a color copy is great as well - I'm sure it will enhance the experience and I'll be sure to post a review of the color version when I get a chance to watch.<br /><br />As for the blu ray though - just beautiful!  Highly recommended.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have been a John Grisham fan for years because his books are reliably very good with lots of suspense and twists to the plots,  The Raketeer did not disappoint!!!
B003O86MY8|5.0|Rock Symphonies really showcases the talent and creativity of David Garrett.  His refreshing way of combining classical and more current music surprises you.  Coupled with his outstanding abilities and keen sense of music.  It is a wonderful addition to my music selections.  So glad a friend recommended it to me.  So I felt the need to pass this find on to others.

0060555661|5.0|By Juan Felipe Gers<br /><br />The Path to become an Intelligent Investor<br /><br />The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham is perhaps the Bible of Value Investing, and one of the first books a person learning about the investments world picks up. Perhaps up until this point you have never heard of the book, or the author, or the pivotal concept which is basically the point of the book. If not implied in the first sentence, I add my name to the thousands, perhaps millions of people that have read it and recommend it as a cornerstone of investing, not only for the beginning investor, but for all types and levels of investors. Besides a recommendation for reading it, I hope that the following words will help you get a best summary of the book and the important concepts it brings with it.<br /> Not by any account is it an easy book to read (at least for the early investor like myself), nor is it a discouraging one. The edition I ready came with a great prologue from John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, that greatly facilitated going through the book by basically introducing some of the concepts and important sentences of the book in a simple way to give you somewhat of a foundation of what to expect. I hope you can get this edition or something similar to it.<br /> It is worth mentioning that the richest man in the world a few years back, nowadays the third richest, is an advocate of Benjamin Graham and Value Investing, stating his investment strategy is \\"85% Graham, 15% Fisher (another great investor of the past century)\\". Graham's popularity is in many ways due to this man, Warren Buffet, once his student at Columbia University. To motivate you to read this book, Buffet once stated that four of his most favorite and beloved books were written before 1950: The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith (where the concept of Capitalism was mainly introduced), Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Philip Fisher, and Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. This brings us back to discussing The Intelligent Investor<br /> The book has in some respects a good order or structure. It introduces the aim of the book and the reader, introducing some ideas, and then going on to describe the type of investors. First starting with the defensive investor and what he should do, he then moves on to what the active investor should not do and then what he should do, later explaining some strategies for him/her. He cites some examples, then talks about the role of the investor as a business owner, and finally closes the book with the concept of margin of safety, the basis for value investing.<br />Graham is perhaps philosophical in many aspects throughout the book, easily grasping this in the introduction of the book. He states here that the market has historically gone down, then up, then back down again, then up, etc., so before doing any kind of investment, se historical trends and figures, and all sorts of financial of operational history of the investment (i.e. the company). He introduces the concept of going against the current and public sentiment, having a \\"margin of safety\\" and a sound investment philosophy. He then warns about doing a thorough analysis of the investment, or else the action would be \\"speculation\\".<br /> A key factor in value investing is to understand public sentiment and being mentally ready to both go against the current and having short-term loses. As long as your investment has been well analyzed and justified, you should be tranquil. The author states that what matters are the Values, not the price movements. This goes along with advisers. The most important piece of knowledge is the analysis of the investor and not that of a third party. Many times advisers will benefit themselves even though their customer doesn't benefit, so be wary, very selective, and get counseling primarily as a second opinion. An important relevant sentence Graham wrote stated \\"Much advice is given free.\\"<br /> Inthe book two types of investors are introduced: defensive and aggressive investors. I will talk very briefly about what these mean to not spoil the book (and make this summary more painful than what it might feel). The defensive are generally highly risk averse, which means they prefer less price variation and a lower expected return of the investment to reduce the riskiness of the investment. Thus he/she will buy primarily US Bonds (the safest investment out there), along with securities in large and prominent well-known companies. This type of investment will be the basis for the enterprising investor, from which he will diversify into secondary stocks and corporate bonds. It is perhaps an overstatement, but this type of investor will make a very thorough analysis of his investment and buy the stock at a lower price than what he thinks is its real value (value investing). Low markets and extreme negative popularity will make for great investment opportunities, as well as a low dividend rate.<br /> There is perhaps no better sentence to depict the theory of value investing than what Graham quoted: \\"the last shall be first and the first shall be last\\". In investment this comes up in trends, with public buying when everybody buys and selling when everybody sells, opening up space for over-valuation or a security being undervalued, and with the correct analysis and historical knowledge the investor can beat the market. This is where the concept of margin of safety starts, where the basis forms. It continues with relevant diversification of the portfolio (buying different companies ideally in different industries, buying diversified bonds and stocks and in today's world this list in other countries). Diversifying, buying in low markets and selling in high markets, thus margin of safety, and sticking to this concept of value investing, will not assure you a positive return or a great return, but it will increase your probabilities and most likely will, especially withmore study, experience. Like Graham stated at the end and which gives a great summary of what this books transmits: \\"To achieve satisfactory returns is easier than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it looks.\\"<br /> I hope that this summary has helped you get the feel for what The Intelligent Investor is about and help you towards your path into the investment world. I also hope that you decide to read it and expand your ideas of investment and the different strategies. Perhaps you will want to get deeply intrigued by the concept of value investing and decide to read Security Analysis and other books of this sort, but also making sure you read other investment philosophies. Finally, I hope I have helped the next Warren Buffet with summarizing what is possibly the most important book in value investing.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Charming story, written in the voice of a dog.  The story didn't develop much, but it was an interesting and entertaining premise.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this  book and I had it sent to my kindle!!  Iwas so happy to g et this and finish it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book totally captured me.  The story was based on a very interesting premise, and the writing was outstanding.  I liked the way the story was interwoven with testimony that was being given before the grand jury.  Only upon reaching the very end of the book is it clear why this is happening.  The unexpected turns in the book were superb.  I highly recommend it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Best series ever!!!!!! I enjoyed the action and romance packed episodes. I cannot wait till the next season. One of my favorite shows to watch.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|this game doesn't want me to take my off it awesomenes this is coolio and I cant wait to play somemore
0547884591|5.0|Just received the book.  I'm just through the first few chapters and Tim has drawn me in.  The stories and point of view have me eager to consume the rest.  The book is gorgeous.  Just skimming the table of contents has me wanting to read it all at the same time.  I can't wait to see what gets inspired for thanksgiving dinner this week!  Read the book, you'll learn a ton on so many levels.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This game is fun to play that requires good eye hand coordination. It has a colorful display and is easy to play.
B009LK6JS2|2.0|Beautiful graphics, but screen keeps flipping over. When I raise the tablet to control pitch past say 40 degrees, the screens flips over to the top and then the plane crashes.<br /> This is happening on new Kindle Fire HD 8.9
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a great game until all of your stuff goes missing including your house... but I turned my kindle off and it was better. just look at the reviews for any game... it will help a lot for info like mine
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Excellent cast, Cruse rocked it ! Brought me back to my Rosta man vibrations days. !!!!!<br />I was bopping with the stars.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Good alien flick. Best one in my opinion since Independence Day. They actually show the aliens and the battles are easy to follow. The ending is not a cliff-hanger, end of humanity thing... good!
B001E45XT4|5.0|I had a pair of these for about 3 or 4 years, they finally died on me and I don't know what to do without them. they are by far the most comfortable pair of headphones i have ever owned. The microphone was nice and hidden when I didn't want it to be used. The sound quality was amazing; VERY loud as well they're currently being used as speakers.<br /><br />The only part I didn't care for was they connector to the size slider on each ear was a tad flimsy, that was what finally broke for me. i'm thinking about getting out the ducktape and patching it till i find another pair that is as good
0345803485|1.0|Many of the one-star reviews written here are more clever than what I have to say (and I agree with them). I am commenting on the audio version of this book, my usual mode of consuming books. Without reservation, I can say I am saddened that a book like this would achieve this kind of success. It is terrible. It isn't even very erotic, and that's supposed to be its strength. It would probably have been rejected by a Harlequin romance editor who had any taste at all. It is silly and poorly written. I know this whole S&M thing can be erotic if done with a modicum of skill, but this does not even come close to that. Do not be taken in by the popularity of this book. I would not be surprised to hear that the majority of the five-star reviews came from Republicans, who seem to have no critical facility when it comes to discerning the difference between what's intelligent and thoughtful and emotional and occasionally erotic, and what is clearly not any of those things in literature or (in the case of the first three adjectives noted) politics.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|The user interface can leave a lot to be desired, but it works...  the notifications get old quick, but I'm sure there's something in the settings.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day left me wanting more of Gideon...the story continues from Bared to You.  Gideon and Eva individually are so complex but together they make their romance so intriguing, sexy, complicated, emotional...I could go on and on you just have to read it to get absorbed in their romance.  You won't be disappointed.
B005N1OUSE|3.0|Unfortunately, I really got nothing new except for some lists of things.  Good place to start if you're clueless, not really worth the money (or time reading) if you're the kind of person who already follows people like Dan Roam on twitter...  for that group I'd recommend The Art of Explanation.
0345803485|1.0|It was not at all what I like to read.  I do not like books this vivid about sex.  I am sorry I bought it
B008CPZNL6|1.0|The original sources work a lot better than this app.  The idea is cool, but the way they executed the UX is just garbage.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I read everything by this author that I can find.  His protagonist, Harry Hole, is so well written. This book did not disappoint and I'm waiting impatiently for the next.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Very little Matthew!  Not at all what the trailers showed.  It was &#34;just okay&#34;<br />pretty poor storyline.<br />Wouldn't buy it.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good story, even with the main bad guy being named after another big cat, which gave it a slight comic book feel. Good characters like Chet and Buck, but it was great to see characters such as Paul Brenner incorporated into the Corey series. The story line itself was good and the research that Demille has done on Yemen was obviously first rate. It's just a pity we'll now have to wait two more years for another.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Best movie ever! I loved it in the movie thearter and it was great to have at home and watch it whenever I want. All the actors really came together in a special way. I would recomend this to anyone. it has action, it has comedy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is really awesome all it needs is a fraction button because I am in 7th grade so we work with a lot of fractions.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|a good app only thing keeping it from getting five stars is that it does not run as a background app.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|That was my initial thought- as there are 5 long volumes. I had watched the TV series of this and must admit that I think it helped to keep a track on all the names and families, knights, lords and ladies, It is wonderfully written, exciting, brutal and sexy all at the same time. It kept me wanting more- can't ask for more than that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty fun app. its a good time waster.  but it takes a lot of playing to build up enough points to open more games if you don't want to buy points.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm almost finished this book and eager to start the next. Wonderful characters and anything's possible! Total fantasy mixed with realism. The only small difficulty is keeping track with the endless names of knights, lords etc!

B004KA9VGA|3.0|The book was a slow start which then picked up. Again towards the end I had to force myself to finish it, as the story dragged and the initial anticipation of something special was just not there.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you enjoy pinning this is a great program try it if you don't like it you can remove it
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is entertaining , it is monotonous though, i didnt care much for that. But otherwise it was ok.
0547884591|5.0|I have to confess that I have been skeptical, to say the least, of Timothy because his past books sound too good to be true. I mean, according to him, you can be both super-rich and have the most amazing sexual copulation parties that you could ever dream of only by reading his books! Wow! If only...if only...However, I think that The 4-Hour Chef is the real deal, homes. Whereas the other two books clearly sounded too good to be true, I fully believe that this tome is very practical and realistic, not filled with any self-promoting exaggerations, questionable \\"science\\" or sensationalism in the slightest. No siree Bob!<br /><br />I truly believe more than ever that I could even be the next Top Chef (Hiya Tom and Padma!!!) just by absorbing all the radical awesomeness contained within this tubular book of cowabunga awesomeness. In just a very short read of almost 700 pages--double-spaced, so you know it's not really that long and more like 350 pages--I learned so much that I really believe I can cook like almost any pro that you see on the Food Network (I am, of course, talking about esteemed chef Juan-Carlos Cruz, the Calorie Commando). Let me give you some amazing examples of what I learned from this sweet, bodacious book.<br /><br />I learned how to open up a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese dinner, and make it all by myself from scratch! Amazing! I know! Prior to reading this book, I would only be able to open the aforementioned box, but not do anything else with it! Sure, Timothy could have focused on more intricate cooking such as molecular gastronomy or at least julienning some vegetables, but I think that opening a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is already quite high-class enough so never mind.<br /><br />Also, I learned all about mixing iced tea crystals with water to--get this, get this--make my own iced tea. Hot da/m/n, lemme tell ya, hot d/a/mn! Before absorbing all the nuggets of valuable info in this book, I could only pour water into a glass and then drink it. Now, I know all about the complicated procedure of making my own iced tea. Thanks, Timothy, thank you!!<br /><br />I urge you, naturally, to purchase this book because it is more credible than Timothy's prior books for all the reasons outlined above. Sure, you may not have that much money anymore because Obama is raising gas prices and making you more dependent on food stamps, but pawn whatever items you need to in order to purchase this book. You will not regret it--I guarantee it!drink it. Now, I know all about the complicated procedure of making my own iced tea.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! The DVDs weren't scratched at all and it seemed to be brand new. Love it love it love it
B008X9Z37A|3.0|The corners are loose and the cover moves around some.  It's good for protection.  I would prefer another case if I ordered again..
B007TK77QE|4.0|Slow start building up the story characters . Story takes hold about half way through the book. The ending is rather sudden leaving the way open for a follow up book
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed the book, The Panther, but found it \\"too wordy\\" plus the constant interruptions to the story for \\"humerous anecdotes. On the plus side it was very informative about a part of the world I knew nothing about.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I simply loved this book. The writer is fabulous in keeping you reading and wanting more. I would highly recommend this book.
0547884591|5.0|I've read both of Tim's other books, and they were great for certain reasons.  But this book is the most detailed content and most beautifully designed book I've ever seen.  It is perfect for anyone who wants to become better at anything (faster) and it gives you many tools to live a better life.  A must have in every home.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The plot and characters keep your attention from the very beginning.  I could not begin to guess the outcome.  Wonderful read. Highly recommend.
B008XG1X18|4.0|ii thought this app was pretty good but it duz freeze sometimes but not as often as everyone says it duz
B005LLSNNE|5.0|All seasons are worth your time and build on each other so would suggest starting from S1 if you're not familiar with the show. Plot and characters change/evolve/die.  Great show.  Not for kids!
B008K7RGA2|5.0|One of the best since Maria Callas at Coven Garden and Jonas Kaufmann is simply unique!<br />He is musicaly and physically totally exceptional!<br />Tosca and Scarpia also are more than credible!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This is a fun watch I would rent it again the end is a little strange but still worth the watch
8876250441|3.0|Let me start by saying that I have never been a big fan of Ms. Meyer's writing or \\"Twilight\\" in general. I did read through the years the first three books more to see what the big deal was about; and since the last movie was coming out I figured it was a good time as any to read the last book, \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" That being, said I actually considered this book the best out of the four. Now my opinion of the first three was very low I suppose there was nowhere else to go but up? I am not going to spoil any of the story, but it is a quick read and the character Bella is the least annoying in this installment, so if you are to read one, read this one.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderful book. Makes you remember why we are all here on this earth and what really is important.  I would recommend to all  generalizations.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It is difficult to believe that the story is not based on truth. John Grisham produced another masterpiece. Great story.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I don't know if it's because I like musicals or that I was alive during the height of this soundtrack - but it is spectacular. Like Wow!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Kindle Fire HD has a small icon in upper right corner. But with this I can track how much battery I have used and have left. Also is great for when I go to charge will show % done left to charge.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|The things that made the book work, meshing real-life historical events with vampire fiction, is mostly ignored in the movie. Especially the last 2/3 of it. If you read the book and liked it, save your money.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|use this everyday to read post and to make my own. Makes the Kindle Fire Hd even better. Would suggest everyone use this app.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I absolutely loved the Hunger Games trilogy.  I would have given this book 5 stars, but the ending kind of sucked.  Seemed like the writer ran out of ideas and did the whole cliched flash forward and it didn't fit the rest of the series.  Even with a crappy ending, the books are totally worth it.  One of my favorite series!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is my favorite show and I am totally hooked!  LOVE IT!  Cannot wait for season 2!  Great acting, plot, and well directed.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|i read book one so fast, book 2 was good i liked that we learned more about macon & lila AKA jane in this book. i however thought it was SLOWWWW until about 60% & then i coudn't stop reading it.. loving the twist at the end, i am going to continue & i hope lena is better in book 3 ** fingers crossed** either way you get lost in this world my mind takes time to process it all so when it takes forever to speed up i have forgotten the begining already.. great for TEENS i am 33 lol oops
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland offers intrigue, surprises, twists and turns that few could predict.<br />Because it keeps you guessing, there is great incentive to keep coming back for more.<br />It reels you in, so hang on for the ride.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book before I go see the movie.  The concept seemed interesting to me.  I found the book very difficult to read.  What I did get was clever and funny but what I had to do to really understand it was too much for me. I consider my self and pretty literate person. I read a lot and many different things but I found getting through this very tedious and it wasn't fun, relaxing reading at all.  Having the Kindle helped but in the end I gave up and didn't finish the book.  It wasn't enticing enough for me to do the work I had to do to understand the writing. I'll check out the film and maybe I'll go back.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this for my iPhone 4. It looks cheaply made. I don't see how it could be water proof or whatever it claimed to be. I have two very rough boys and I could see them dropping it and the case cracking. The screen protector had a big bubble under it. No matter what I did, it wouldn't go away. I'm not going to but another one to see if it would be different. The case thickness was the same as one of those cheap phone cases you buy in the middle of the mall. I just can't see how this would work. I also found out the hard way that if you don't have an iPhone brand charger it won't work with this case. So look into buying a charger extender. There ruffle cheap, they work well. I ended up buying a Griffen survivor case instead.
0425263916|5.0|All I have to say is that Good news is I finished  it in 1 day, Bad news is that I finished it in 1 day!!!<br />I want more of it and can hardly wait for the 3rd or 4th book (I really hope she makes a 4th one)!
B0070XB0N6|3.0|I kind of knew what to expect when I purchased the book, having just read Gaiman's American Gods. It was a very quick read, detailed and entertaining. Coraline is a great book for any age.
1449410243|2.0|This book is funny enough, and I am a huge fan of The Oatmeal, but I couldn't help but feel that of the 136 pages in the book, only 36 of them were actual funny, well though out content, and the rest was filler. I pre-ordered this book, but if I knew now what I did then, I wouldn't order it again.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Blood, Action, Aliens growning inside people...  What else would you expect?  I think this is about the same &#34;story&#34; type as the other Alien movies.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love Little Women. It is one of my favorite book, and I was very pleased to get it on Kindle. Made it much easier for school.

0385535147|3.0|Interesting for two-thirds, a very implausible ending undermined everything for me. Plots have to be believable, this one isn't, and the characters are paper-thin, from floundering warden to uptight father. It feels like this was dashed off in a weekend. Let's hope Grisham isn't going the Clancy route where he pays attention to brand promotion and not quality work. This is an \\"air book\\"--it makes sense if you're trapped on an airplane. The plot is so convoluted that you need a road map.

B000OBYLVO|5.0|I liked this movie, although I have some other favorites, this is a good movie, I would recommend this movie.
B008458O3S|5.0|Excellent concept.  Very easy to learn but equally challenging to master.  Found it hard to put down, need to do one more...
B007PVHMCG|2.0|This is a $30 product.  However, a few 'enterprising' individuals are selling it for 300% of it's suggested retail price, because (a) it's Minecraft branded, and (b) we're close to the holidays.<br /><br />You should only buy it as a novelty for your friends and family that are Minecraft enthusiasts.  It's not really a very good Lego set, and is only interesting as a gimmick for extreme Minecraft fans.  As such, at the price these vendors are charging, it's not worth it.<br /><br />You will notice that Amazon itself does not have stock of the item, neither does Jinx.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a really fun app, with beautiful scenery as well. And it works perfectly on the Kindle Fire HD 7\\". At the home screen go to Options to enter your pilot name, calibrate your controls and establish your settings for the game. From the Home screen you can choose which plane to fly. Then, from the Play button you'll get access to the Tutorials. And you'll also get to choose which kind of flight you want to make: If you choose \\"Free Flight\\" you can choose easier tasks like field takeoff, and carrier takeoff. Otherwise, you'll begin with Landings -- which can be pretty tough. The Tutorials will show you how to toggle between an external view of your plane, the cockpit view, or the HUD view, and other helpful topics. Radar will guide you to your target. ***It's a very satisfying flight experience and the controls can be quickly learned. Taking off is really easy -- but landing...well, that's going to take some practice. But FIVE STARS for this!!
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|This book offers an excellent challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy on cellular biology.  The book also offers a useful personal application.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Just finished this book and I felt I may have wasted some time. Book was way out even for a fiction,lacked climax and a ending that was fair at best. I felt the ending was written in one setting and thrown together just to get the book to the publisher. Sorry John not close to any of your past works.
B008458O3S|5.0|I really enjoyed this app.  I have been able to unlock bonus games and expert mode.  I have not found any bugs.  I am very plased with my purchase and recommend it to anyone that. likes logic puzzles.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I've been a Floyd fan since the 70's. Not exactly a passionate one, but I liked the music. It was a part of my youth.<br />I saw the Division Bell tour in 1994 - my first Pink Floyd concert ever.<br /><br />My son wanted to buy this DVD because he's just getting into Pink Floyd. So I bought it for him.<br /><br />I was mesmerized. 'Pulse' captures all of those memories and more in one DVD.<br />Astounding performances and that awesome light show, well-shot and astounding audio quality.<br /><br />If you're a Pink Floyd fan, this is a must-have.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It was suggested I read this, couldn't put it down...next one please! What's up with the word requirements? C mon seriously
0763644765|3.0|As with all of Patricelli's books this one does a great job of contrast and compare. Great way to reinforce potty training and keep it light/fun. My only problem was that this book, although purchased as a new book, it clearly has a printing flaw that was noticed and manually colored-in with what appeared to be a crayon! It was a small problem for a toddler's book that will take lots of wear & tear, but it made the new book appear to be used and for that I fault the seller who noticed or should have that the page was damaged. I could easily have returned the item but my grandson enjoyed it and the flaw was too small to justify a trip to the post office.
B00000J048|5.0|My 3 year old son absolutely loves this toy. He is not a typical boy who plays with cars and trains as intended - he pulls all his toys apart in order to figure out how they work and is especially fascinated with gears. So this toy is perfect for his inquisitive mind. Very durable, easy to setup, and continued to entertain him daily. The only thing to watch out for if you have a younger baby in the house as well, is that there are little connector pieces that connect the gear to the white lego-like surface. The connectors are about an inch in diameter and may be a choking hazard for little ones. So we keep a close eye when the toy is out and sequester the extra connectors in a separate ziploc bag so that our 3 year old only has enough to work with at the time. Our younger son is almost 19 months, and even he is taking to the toy as well and can almost figure out how to connect the gears together but doesn't quite have the dexterity to make it work.  He does however love to just spin a gear in his hand. A fun thing our 3 year old figured out is holding the gear under a faucet so that it spins like a water wheel. Definitely will buy most products from this brand!
B009LK6JS2|1.0|I'm sure this is a fun game. It sure looks fun. Unfortunately there's absolutely no guidance on how to play it. What do the controls represent? What effect does moving the wings have? I couldn't even figure out how to get the plane anywhere near the ground until I stalled it, and I have no idea how I did that. Add some instructions and I'll give it an honest chance. But if I'm meant to learn all of this through experimentation, sorry but I don't have time in my day for that.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Excellent story - great characters - Joss is the best writer of our time.  Firefly is the Star Trek of our generation.  There needs to be several more movies!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Story was a little weak and disjointed. Effects were ok the general premmis was good. good watch if you have nothing better to do.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Being a medical professional, I really appreciated this book.  Now I can empathize with my patients who have wondered about or been through similar experiences.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Brilliant Donald Fagan  ... just as we expect  ..this time extra super horn arrangements  .. great songs<br /><br />takes a while to get into it  ..need to play the CD a few times over to pick up the subtlelties<br /><br />Hope this guy never gives up
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|My advanced Arte & Film Spanish class was assigned this movie even though it is in English.  Frida is my favorite painter so it was no chore at all.  I loved the movie and thought Salma was wonderful in that she was able to portray Frida from a young girl to her death.
B00367XA1K|5.0|As America edges closer to a split between factions, this movie is a must see. It describes a true story with eloquence using first hand witness accounts of the Russian revolution. We learn what really happened in the early 20th century to cause the revolt. In addition, we can see the interim period of democratic rule under Alexander Kerensky, before the oligarchy led by Lenin came to power. Plus, it is a noteworthy love story. After seeing it I read everything I could find written by the participants. This movie is absolutely faithful to the truth. By intermission you want to go out and find a revolution to join. This is history at its best.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It has everything. NAME IT.  Charming, happy loving Funny, heartbreaking and learning a whole new way of living. THIS BOOK WILL NOT LET YOU PUT IT DOWN. A WOMAN OR MAN CAN N RELATE ON SO MANY LEVELS. AMAZING.  RUN TO IT AND HAVE A WHOLE NEW LIFE.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is another excellent book from John Grisham.  The suspense was good right up to the end.  I always look forward to when he releases another book
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Taken is an action packed movie with a great story. Especially since I have a daughter and would probably do the same thing as this guy did to get her back if I had to.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Anything that encourages my daughter to read gets 5 stars from me! Shipping was prompt and timely as well. Thanks!
B000VI12ZS|4.0|The story of the code talkers is an important one that finally allows those Native Americans involved to be recognized. I enjoyed the movie.
B007P3Q95K|3.0|Why do I surf Amazon.com UK? I only get frustrated! So many great films that aren't available in the US, or are not available on Blu-ray. This series has got such rave reviews that I want to shake somebody at some silly film studio who is missing a lot of potential sales across the pond. Well, maybe someday.
B00633PFQC|5.0|Well written. Eye opening. Definitely puts into perspective what we do without thinking and the moral implication of it. Everyone should read this!
B008Y72UN6|5.0|I love this movie. It's cute and blue and I love the NYC scenery.... :).  It's a good HD purchase too since its a new movie and details are plenty.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|So far the walking dead. Up to Season 3 episode 6 (so far) has been great. Sometimes I have difficulty seeing the \\"hidden messages\\" that characters hint at throughout each episode. So I end up watching them again. But I don't mind that.<br /><br />Overall the Walking Dead is a fun and entertaining show to watch with family and friends. The only reason why this isn't a 5star review is because the season, so far, is not yet completed. I do bid a warning. Due to graphic nature. You may find yourself desensitized after watching an episode. Very gory.
0385535147|3.0|Definitely not Grisham's best.  It's hard to connect with the main character (Bannister) since the author reveals little about him or his motivations.  Also, the book jumps around, and not in a good way.  The last 100 pages or so finally picked up steam as the big reveal drew near, but up until then it was rather boring.  Finally, the reader must suspend all reality in order to accept the premise.
B0012GMV58|2.0|\\"Welcome,\\" the fifth studio album by Santana is a train wreck of jazz-fusion and Latin funk filtered through spiritual ministering, an experiment that now sounds tedious and dated. The opening track, Going Home, is a noodling mess of keyboards and percussion that never goes anywhere, much less home, and the cymbals are so overused that I cannot listen without cringing. Love, Devotion and Surrender force feeds the listener early `70s guru-laden drivel about spirituality. Mother Africa seems much longer than it is, a garbled, unfocused, unlistenable track, and the transition between its bombast and the cheesy strings that render Light of Life into what sounds like the theme song to a blaxploitation film of the early `70s (this album was released in November 1973).<br /><br />There are some redeeming moments in Samba de Sausalito, When I Look into Your Eyes, and Flame Sky, but not nearly enough to save this album. The odd vocal effects, jazzy affectations, hot cymbals, and ornate keyboards overwhelm any power the rhythm section tries to muster and this recording is not the starting place for anyone wanting to hear Carlos Santana cut loose with his \\"cry of the soul\\" guitar playing.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I am a minecraft modder and I know many different scripts. if you take a look at the coding of minecraft pocket edition and this you can easily tell that they copied the code and then added a few more things and changed some textures and decided they would try to make money off of it.<br />I only have one thing to say to the people that made this, minecraft may have an open soured code for modders like me to make nods but it is illegal to use the code to make money. I have contacted the mojang team about this matter and you will be hearing from them soon.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I appreciate that it's not traditional, but it's still just so good! Something this fun to listen to can't be wrong :)
B007SGLZP8|1.0|If John Grisham's name was not on the cover I would not have known he had written \\"The Racketeer.\\"  This lastest of his books is not even close to the quality of the rest of his works (and I have them all).
B005LAIGW8|5.0|The fact that the movie producers picked a new VMAX for the bike is a nice plus!  Wanted this on video in our library since we liked the movie so much.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|It's amazing, I got hooked and watched through season 5.  Amazing. Keep in mind the first season is short, only around 7 episodes.  might be cheaper to just buy the on demand version.
B000MMN6YS|5.0|Although the story is rather dark, this is an excellent movie.  The scenes of the Paris market are so visceral that you gain a real sense of the misery and stench.  The convention of showing what the main character smells is brilliant.  The point is made without being cheesy or over the top.  Well acted, well shot, well directed.....  All of the crafts in this movie are well done, including production design and costume.  I have not read the book but I've been told this was an excellent job of capturing a very difficult story, where the main character is not a sympathetic character at all.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|please add heathers622. I love this game, but have to start completely over because of an issue with my kindle and lost all my friends. really frustrated about that but that's an issue with amazon not team lava. this game is great, I highly recommend it.

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|We watched this movie just a few days before taking my 2 year old on the Polar Express train.  He enjoyed the movie and it made the train ride that much more special.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Excellent mystery. excellent progression in this series. I love the way the characters are developed in this series. Highly reccommended
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I'm soo sad :( it wont let me install the game that ive wanted ever since i saw it :( poooopppp
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Good movie. Saw a preview on another movie for this movie and checked it on imdb. found it to download for a great price. Wish it was louder though.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love it! The color is vibrant. And it is so much easier to power the Kindle on and off! Great seller and item! Thanks!
B0081SKYDG|5.0|We did not do all the damage, but I remember some parties like this. The moments you live to talk about. Great movie.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I really enjoyed the story, the introduction of each character, and the special effects. The conversion from comic book to movie was fairly faithful (as I recall). Make sure you stick around for the end of the credits for what has become a Marvel film signature teaser to the next chapter of the movie series.
B003WUYP56|5.0|Am not an active Physicist. I try to floowe along as things develop. It was a very good read for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I dont know how I have gotten by this long in my life without Pinterest! Tips and tricks on anything and everything! I love it!
B009MO57H6|3.0|First, let me say I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series but unfortunately, this installation was a bit of a letdown. I absolutely HATE this trend of two- part movies and/or movies that leave you with an unsatisfying cliffhanger. All of the previous Resident Evil movies end with something of a cliffhanger but they also clearly have a strong plot and ending to them that hints at what is next to come. This movie was more of a lead in to the next in the series which looks AWESOME. Instead of making this a separate movie for a few more bucks, they should have made an extra long movie that combines this with the next in the series. There is not much of a plot and the trailers lead you to expect a much more exciting movie that simply does not deliver. It reminded me of a weak a term paper that is too wordy and has obviously been stretched to meet the length requirements for the assignment. At the end of the movie my only reaction was an indifferent shrug and the thought that I should have waited to watch it on video instead of rushing to see it on opening weekend.
B008M721MS|4.0|i haven't really achieved much so its early for me to give an opnion.  id be happy to rate another time when i have a better understsnding of  the product. can u dig
0525953728|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it.. It was a really great read... I would recommend this book to buy and have on your shelf...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. neds mine corts. so cull. I cant stop playing it. somedays I played it for ever. it is so awesome
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|a very good find hiding things solve puzzle game so all in all very fun. cant wait for the sequel
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This new novel is one of Grisham's best.  It is certainly the best he has written recently.  I am a fan again.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|The Secret Daughter was an excellent book. Well written and the story line very very believable. It also depicted the Indian culture regarding boy and girl children very well and with sensitivity. I would defintely recommend this book to other readers.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|She might not be our favourite character, the kingmaker's daughter and wife of Richard III, in the York family history, but Gregory gives her a face and a voice, thus completing the three York brothers' story in which we have so far revelled particularly through Giaquetta's and Elizabeth's books by her. She excels again at making history excitong through a woman's life. I am looking foreard to her next book about Henry VIII's mother, another Queen Elizabeth.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Good book that seems to drag at times in my opinion.  I like the history and the characters as well as I did with the Pillars of the Earth.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoy playing and building a town. The balance between managing growth while keeping food on the table and making the most profit is engaging.  But there needs to be a broader explanation. Of the various parts of the game. Like what can you do with stars????. Why when you buy $$to pay for a house it does not show up in the town or in the inventory so you can gain profits from it later.
B008G59IKO|4.0|Can it really be almost 20 years since I first discovered Green Day?  It almost doesn't seem possible.  One of the problems you run into as a band that lasts that long is that your fans will all want something different from you.  Some will want you to continue to evolve and some will cling to the past sound like it is the Holy Grail and nothing should ever be changed.  When I heard that Green Day was going to be releasing three releases in short succession I was interested in what that would bring to the table.  Where &iexcl;Uno! flat out rocked &iexcl;Dos! changes it up a bit.<br /><br />There is plenty of the classic Green Day sound here but they also strip it down and change it up enough to make it interesting.  The opening track \\"See You Tonight\\" clearly sets that tone with a stripped down arrangement with just a hollow sounding guitar providing the musical background.  This sound comes back at the end with \\"Amy,\\" which I think is the strongest track on the album paying a lot of homage to a Beatles sound than anything else.<br /><br />In between you have some loud and rowdy tunes where I kept hearing that 60's Beatles and Psychedelic influence in both the distorted vocals and the guitar riffs.  I always love when a band can not only cross genres but also time periods and I think Green Day does a pretty good job here of making music that does just that.<br /><br />Another standout track here is \\"Nightlife\\" featuring Lady Cobra.  It features a nice deep bass grove and is something more funky than you'd expect from Green Day.  Again, a case of where stretching the sound is doing a service to the album.<br /><br />Overall a fun album from Green Day that anyone that likes their previous work should like!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have enjoyed all of Vince Flynn's novels and am a fan of Mitch Rapp.  So, I enjoyed The Last Man very much.  But I am a bit conflicted as I felt that the story dragged a bit and had a bit to much extraneous information in it rather than the fast paced action that I have grown use to with Mitch Rapp.<br /><br />Mitch has always worked hard and worked alone with just couple of others around to fill in the gap.  But here we have a 'team effort' in the case of finding out what happened to Joe Rickman, a Clandestine Service Operator who has been kidnapped.  I found the extra people involved made the story flow a bit slower.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am not disappointed that I purchased it.  I am happy that Vince Flynn is back and writing and that he is doing better health wise.  This book has satisfied my need for another Mitch Rapp story.  I will now look forward to the next installment and am sure that it will be a bit faster paced.<br /><br />Mitch Rapp is called in to help find Joe Rickman who has been kidnapped from his safe house in Pakistan.  That shouldn't have happened.  His four body guards are dead, all shot once in the head.  Rickman is gone and most likely being tortured for his information regarding the entire spy network that the CIA has put in place over the last 10 to 15 years.<br /><br />Add to that problem that someone or some agency is trying to frame Mitch as being a turncoat who has squirreled away millions of agency funds to his own private account and you have a real problem.  Mitch is trying to do his job but a Senator and a bumbling FBI agent are making it their task to try and nail Mitch.<br /><br />Then add to that the fact that someone has put a contract out on Mitch's life and the shooter has come very close to sealing the deal and you have a real page turner that will keep you interested.<br /><br />Mitch will almost die, he will come back and do his best to succeed and he will deal with the fact that his best friend / mentor, Stan Hurley, has only six months to live.  Stan will team up with Mitch and the two together are not a team that you want on your trail.<br /><br />While I did say the book wasn't as action packed as I recall other Mitch Rapp books it is still one that I enjoyed and lost sleep over.  I trust you will enjoy it as well.t that his best friend / mentor, Stan Hurley, has only six months to live.  Stan will team up with Mitch and the two together are not a team that you want on your trail.<br /><br />While I did say the book wasn't as action packed as I recall other Mitch Rapp books it is still one that I enjoyed and lost sleep over.  I trust you will enjoy it as well.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I loved it, it was a great movie fast and quick no problems. It was awesome. Will definitely rent the movie again.
B00A9Q70Y4|4.0|I think this is one of the best zombie media creations ever made, though it does have its imperfections. As a few others have mentioned sometimes there's a certain level of reality missing.. I keep wondering when the nuclear meltdown is going to happen, not to mention other catastrophes that would likely occur with human neglect - and zombie meddling. For me 28 Days Later is still the scariest Zombie tale ever put on screen. But I digress! I like the characters in this show, the zombies are mostly scary (but again, not as terrifying as the 28 Days Later variety), and my suspension of disbelief is sufficient enough to be entertained. Season three seems to be building up with intensity - the Governor's compound vs. The Prison - brother against brother / Daryl, Merle - Andrea's seduction by the Governor. Kind of hoping Michonne and Rick get together. The one thing that bugs me is that basically everyone becomes a zombie sooner or later once you are dead. It seems to add a sense of.. futility, or to deflate the whole issue of the dead vs. living.. (or undead vs. living). Becoming a zombie is basically inevitable, unless someone drives a knife through your skull before you turn. But philosophically the premise and \\"human\\" condition is engaging nonetheless. There's certainly an existentialist perspective to what's happening.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|acting was better than a lot of movies i have seen recently. story was good. i felt involved in the story and its got lincoln killing vampires. what more can u want from a movie
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|Media playback works extremely well. I use Plex to play MKVs stored on my Windows PC running a Plex Server.<br /><br />The app would be perfect with the addition of a few minor tweaks and features:<br /><br />1. Navigation should save the previous position; I often has re-scroll through the media list after watching an item.<br />2. Continuous play; after a media item completes, I would like the next item to play, regardless of folder, artist, year, etc. and independent of the method used to navigate to the item.<br />3. Add a checkbox, \\"Default to this selection\\", on the Play on this Device dialog.<br /><br />Plex is a great app and we enjoy having Plex as our home media platform.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Devices: Kindle Fire, Desire Z, Galaxy S3, Nexus 7, HTC Jetstream, Galaxy Tab 10.1, Nexus One, Logitech Revue
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it I love it I love it! I've heard about this game and wanted it and now I have it! I am sooooo happy! Sorry, I should say more than just \\"I LOVE IT\\".... I should say something like \\"This is an amazing game about raising dragons, racing, competing in competitions, earning coins to buy awesome stuff, and obtaining the legendary dragon, Kairos. Plus, it's absolutely FREE!!!!!!\\" That's the kind of stuff I should be saying. :)
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like to  play solitare. This game is as good as Solitare but I also like numbers games.  Keeps your mind acive.
B002ZG981E|5.0|bought this on blue ray because its the only way it deserves to be watched. one of the better movies to come out in recent years and a lot of fun. not a perfect movie, but enjoyable and very good.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is one series where you never know how it will go, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, I just can't wait till Sunday nites to see where the plot will go next.  GREAT SHOW TO WATCH, JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING YOU GET A CURVE BALL AN YOU END UP IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION...  THIS SERIES IS GREAT, SO LOOKING FOR THE NEXT SERIES.....
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While the main character in the book is a former lawyer, this book is a nice departure from the law dramas for which Grisham is famous. This book packs more suspense and mystery. At times I was wondering if I missed something along the way, but all made sense in the end. It's not a novel that i couldn't put down, but I thought it was a good read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is so addicting! I absolutely love it! I can never put it down! Highly recommended to any female!
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Did not Know who she was but heard her voice and had to find her, music and lyrics that stopped me and made me want to listen
B009KHDT0C|4.0|It looked like a really funny movie and it held up. Not my favorite movie, but I definitely would watch it again.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|i loved the series fire fly and this is just as good, if not better. wish there was more to watch because the show and movie are great.  looks great on blu ray
B009E3EWPI|2.0|I put on the blu-ray DVD within seconds of delivery with great anticipation. The crowd noise sounded like I was standing there. I could hear Page's fingers running across the frets. But Plant's vocals sounded as if they were recorded in a garage and JPJ's bass lines were a muddy mess. I rechecked and made sure that I had the audio set to 5.1. I did. I tried the PCM stereo and it wouldn't play at all. (Pardon my ignorance, but what is PCM stereo anyway?.) I'm hoping that this is just a problem with my copy but I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books, and The Racketeer was a different take and very exciting.  Couldn't put it down and finished in two days.  It was a great read and proves again that Grisham is one of the best.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I recommend this book to all who ask about what goes on in the background of the military.  As an Army Dad and Dad-in-law I have the greatest respect for those who serve, especially those in Special Forces.  Read the book.
1932100660|5.0|A book well researched and written, money over the health of people, we must decide how we are to be perceived.  Must read for anyone questioning the food industry and government
B009B0L324|5.0|This would be probably be a die-hard fan review. I bought it because it has Phil Rudd on drums. The other live albums from Donnington, didn't pack that same punch with drummer Chris Slade (who by all means was technically sound so no disrespect intended).<br /><br />But got to love the fact Rudd's on drums and it's a live album with the songs you would expect minus the material from Stiff Upper Lip (which is understandable).<br /><br />If only they threw money talks in here as I'd love to hear Phil Rudd's drumming take on that.  Hopefully the lads will give us a new album sometime in the not too distant future.<br /><br />OVERALL - does not disappoint.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Hate to say it but I couldn't finish this book. I do not believe I have ever done that before. I made it to about 41% and just couldn't take it anymore. I kept waiting for it to take off or for something to happen but it never did. Kind of like reading someone's boring diary that you have absolutely no interest in. I just don't get the popularity...I feel ripped off!  Hmm, maybe it is just too girly as another reader suggested.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|In general, I've not been very impressed with any of the Blu-ray DVDs, however this one is exceptional.  We think it's well worth it!!
B009682EFQ|5.0|First I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of Neurosis, but I haven't always been and don't fully enjoy all of their work (mostly the really early stuff).  I've seen them live twice and I didn't have any knowledge of the band before seeing them.  They were opening for other bands.  The last time they came thru my town was when they released 'Through Silver In Blood' back around 1996.  I didn't know the music but was absolutely blown away by their stage performance.  They're the type of band that can make you feel stoned when your sober.  Their music is deep and hypnotic.  The general formula for their albums is that they flow from song to song.  Light flowing instrumentals and effects flow into crushing guitar solos while the vocals are raw and dark, yet full of atmospheric and image conjuring words and poetry.  They seem to make an album as one whole piece - not broken down for radio consumption - and I respect that as it is the more artistic thing to do.  Their songs flow from almost overwhelmingly heavy apocalyptic doom filled rage and despair to light airy instrumentals that break up the songs into individual pieces of work.<br /><br />  Now, if your familiar with this band and you've enjoyed the direction they're going then don't hesitate another minute and buy it!  It's easily as good or better than past releases in my opinion.  They aren't straying far from their recent formula which is good in my opinion yet it is totally different and unique.  Nothing on this release feels like it's been done before.<br /><br />  If you aren't familiar with this band, this is my own quick and dirty interpretation but this is how I've come to view the music.  They seemed to start out with some very heavy punk roots.  I didn't particularly enjoy their first cd's.  I didn't really get into this band until 'Through Silver In Blood' and if your looking to get to know their music I would suggest starting with their latest releases and working backwards through their catalog.  The newest music is easiest to digest and the farther you look back the harder and grittier the music becomes - much less polished.<br /><br />This is a band that has evolved into something that is just amazing to me and why the rest of the world either can't see it or can't handle it is beyond me.  When I hear their music, I get images of Leonard Baskin's art, of Native American religion and folklore, of images of our own demise and doom individually and as a whole, I get images of doom, death, birth, light and dark, the elements.  I could go on and on.  It's dark and it's a beautiful thing to experience.<br />If you enjoy deep moving music, check these guys out.  And do them justice by listening on a quality system with no distractions or use headphones.  You'll be rewarded.  Their music will unfold to you as you hear it again and again growing on you revealing more with each repetition.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I imagine everything has been said that can be from over these 500 reviews. I'll just say that just having finished Book 1 over the last couple weeks, I am now eagerly looking forward to Book 2. This story was just phenomenal.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read the entire series, and these books are most definitely page turners. The books dive into a very unknown world for most people, and it will make you open your eyes.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|Without this book, I would have had to pay someone to upload my eBook and then probably go back and edit it several times before getting it just right. With this book, I was able to do it all myself, and although I had to go back and do some re-editing, it didn't involve working around someone else's time.<br /><br />The writing is clear and concise with a \\"cut to the chase\\" format. The instructions are easy to follow, and whenever I found myself floundering about a little detail, there was a screenshot illustrating what I needed to do. Naturally not every single question is addressed, probably because the authors assume some formatting knowledge on the part of the eBook writer.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Awesome show missed the beginning of the season so I had to catch up.<br />Love it would recommend to anyone and everyone.
0151010684|4.0|A chance encounter between Dr. Aziz and two English ladies at a mosque in Chandrapore, India would be uneventful if the elderly Mrs. Moore hadn't been so taken with the charming young doctor, and he with her. Mrs. Moore and her future daughter-in-law, Adela Quested, are captivated by the country on their visit and want to see more of the real India. Unfortunately, they get more than they bargained for during a planned visit to the Marabar Caves outside the city, which leads to misunderstandings and courtroom drama that changes lives forever.<br /><br />A Passage to India is E.M. Forster's most famous novel and for good reason. The book says a great deal about British attitudes toward the Indian culture and people during the 1920's. Forster portrays a love-hate relationship among key players. The difference in cultures and lack of understanding is superbly drawn, as is the barely concealed disdain between the British and locals. You can almost feel the simmering animosity threatening to erupt into a full explosion.<br /><br />The book is fairly long at 421 pages, yet I wished I'd known more about how secondary characters dealt with the aftermath of the trial. Forster barely mentions some of the characters afterward, which is a shame. Still, this is my favorite of his collection, and well worth reading.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I've been a big fan since season one.  There's a scene in episode Anne Frank #2 that Jessica Lange exhibited probably some of the best acting I have ever seen.  She really deserves another Emmy for this year's performance - just amazing.<br /><br />Of course, this is not Glee and has everything in it from the possessed, man-made monsters, aliens, people who behave like monsters, etc but there's a story of redemption in here somewhere - yet to be seen - but perhaps not.<br /><br />Overall, if you like this genre, it's some of the best out there and certainly some of the best TV out there.
B00917IQFY|2.0|This album seemed like such a great idea: Reunite a brilliant songwriter with his crack backup band after 31 years, and a classic album surely will follow. Unfortunately, it works better as a concept. Graham Parker and the Rumour don't squeeze out many sparks here.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst part is that Parker's lyrics are lazy. He used to be clever, but here he's complacent: \\"I know you been through more than enough/Lots of sad things pain and other stuff.\\" This from a guy who effortlessly turned people into film exposures in \\"Discovering Japan,\\" a guy who took just two lines to express the misfortune of a Venezuelan tribe's encounter with white missionaries: \\"Losing their loincloths as they gain ethnicide/All dressed in Western clothes and God will be their guide.\\" (\\"Break Them Down.\\") Now, the best he can do is enough/stuff?<br /><br />As for the band, that guitar buzz saw that used to be Belmont + Schwarz? Toothless. Bob Andrews (keyboards) is the only one earning his paycheck.<br /><br />Seven songs into the album, the band starts to cook with \\"A Lie Gets Halfway 'Round the World,\\" but at the very end, they just stop playing. No fadeout. Nothing. They just stop--too lazy to put a decent ending on the song. The sad thing is, the band clearly still has the chops. \\"Coathanger\\" would not be out of place on any Parker/Rumour album. So why don't they deliver?<br /><br />I expected more from Parker after hearing Ian Hunter's latest, When I'm President (which you should buy right now). I mean, Hunter's 73 and he rocks like the Rolling Stones circa Exile on Main Street. But Parker and the boys sound like the doctor told them they shouldn't get too worked up because it might give them a heart attack. \\"Three Chords Good\\" sounds like an album recorded by a bored cover band at a wedding reception in a bingo hall.<br /><br />Two photos in the lyrics booklet sum up the difference between the old Rumour and this one. The first photo shows the old version of the Rumor playing, Parker in the foreground, tilting the mic stand, singing with a look on his face telegraphing the relentless drive that was a hallmark of him and the band. The photo on the facing page shows the band members as they are today. Take the guitars out of the photo, and these six guys look like anything but a rock band, and they sure don't sound anything like the Graham Parker and the Rumour that ripped its way through the '70s, producing some of the best, smartest rock from that decade or any other. Another 31-year wait is in order.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an addictive and delightful romp. The first two thirds of the book are outstanding - the twists and turns are artfully delivered, and whenever you think you have a character nailed, they shape shift. The last third was somewhat more challenging, weaving an ending into such a complex narrative was clearly a challenge. Without doubt though, this is a book worth reading, and I am now off to explore other titles by this author.
B00886XQO0|1.0|When I first used them they were AWESOME, but that didn't last.  They worked for a one hour game and then after that they started with the crackle and pop sounds, which seemed caused by certain colors or effects in the game, or they'd cut out completely.  Customer service told me they needed to be reset and re-paired.  I followed their directions and it still wasn't fixed.  Self troubleshooting, I replaced the optical audio cable with RCAs and this made them usable for about a day.  Then the crackle and pop started getting worse again.  I said screw it, went and bought some cheap X12s, and these are going back.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This book wraps up the Old Man's War trilogy and in a nice way. It features a return to the original lead characters of John Perry and Jane Sagan and follows their journey to colonise a new planet. Another excellent sci fi read from John Scalzi with more of a focus on politics, subterfuge and the wider galactic alliances than previous novels.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I am waiting for the series to come out on Blu-ray. I am very disappointed that they didn't release the Blu-ray version, yet. Come on, what are they waiting for? Same is happening with Suburgatory, Touch and others. DVD is history!!
B004P1JEXE|3.0|this book suffers greatly from bloating. although i've really enjoyed the series, this volume is indulgent on the author's behalf - not much of anything happens, despite the hundreds and hundreds of pages. also, the tone is sometimes facetious, making the reader feel a little duped. some serious editing is required, as both this and the previous volume, also edited, could have been published as one. he needs to just get to it already!

B004JMY312|5.0|This is my favorite Halloween movie and I have to watch it EVERY Halloween.  The quality was good and it made my night when I got to see it!
0385737955|3.0|In The Maze Runner, Mr. Dashner tells of a young man, Thomas, who is transported in an elevator to a mysterious place where other teenagers fight against metal monsters to survive.  None of them remember much of their outside lives, and their only mission is to escape.<br /><br />Why to buy this book: It is competently written and is fast paced.  Action drives the plot to a satisfactory and quick conclusion.<br /><br />Why not to buy the book: While the writing is competent, it is not spectacular.  There are a few annoyances, like Mr. Dashner's overuse of semi-colons and transparent attempts to withhold information at the start of the novel.  He would have been much better off simply addressing Thomas' questions at the start instead of having half a dozen different characters say, \\"You have to wait until tomorrow to find out what's going on.\\"  Really?  The main problem for me, though, was that I didn't start to care about the POV character until half way through the book.  I think the author should have devoted more time to character development at the start whether than trying to drive the story with hooks.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The biggest indictment of the book I can give is that I'm not willing to spend money to buy any more of the series.  If I had spare time and someone gave them to me, I'd read them, but I'm not breaking out my credit card for them.  I give it a middle-of-the-road 3 stars.
B001JFZ118|3.0|This is by far NOT the best made movie, and it's very graphically violent. I bought it for the music when I learnd that Queen wrote the entire score for it and a few of their biggest hits came from this score (Who Wants to Live Forever is beyond description!).
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I read all Nelson DeMille books just so I can pine, \\"I wish I had said that!\\"  Of course, my brain is too slow for the quick retorts that DeMille writes, yet I never tire of them especially when all the characters are so well described and plots so twisty.  I even let my ex-wife know if he writes a new book because she's a fan too.

0618918248|3.0|I have organized my review of The God Delusion into two sections: a general review of the book and specific critiques of Dawkins' arguments.  Richard Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and an excellent writer (see his book \\"The Selfish Gene\\" for proof), however, to me this book reflects more of an attempt on his part to settle a political score than a serious attempt at philosophy in debating the existence of God.  The reason I say this is because nearly all of the arguments Dawkins makes to refute the existence of God are either overgeneralizations, selective abstractions of evidence, or straw man arguments.  Dawkins, as much as anyone, should be the first to recognize that these primitive rhetorical tactics are just as potent in refuting the scientific worldview as they are the theistic worldview, and hence, it would behoove him not to use them.<br /><br />GENERAL REVIEW:<br />Insofar as there is still a need to debunk the myth of God as the omniscient and omnipotent \\"old man in the sky,\\" as suggested by a literal interpretation of the Old Testament, Dawkins does an excellent job of debunking this myth and invalidating the merits of a literal interpretation of the Bible by using historical and scientific evidence, as well as sound reasoning.  He is meticulous in explaining how such a view of God is inconsistent with an objective scientific worldview and he also does a good job of highlighting inconsistencies within the Bible itself, as well as the hypocrisy of some of the religious fundamentalists who critique him.<br /><br />However, the main strength of this book is also its main weakness.  The anthropomorphic representation of God that is propagated by fundamentalists - one that depicts God as being jealous and vengeful, like humans, but yet omnipotent and capable of intervening in all human affairs (including football games) - has been debunked for centuries, as evidenced by the quotes Dawkins himself provides from Thomas Jefferson and other American founding fathers.  Not only to do most educated people today reject this representation of God, but many theists and deists do as well.  Though some holdovers still remain who believe in this version of God, it seems that Dawkins truly believes that his rational arguments can convince these people that they are wrong.  This is as much a waste of time as it is trying to convince those who believe the world is flat that it is actually round.  George Will has a great line about the effort to try and convince irrational people of rational things:  \\"It is impossible to reason people out of affiliations they have not been reasoned into.\\"<br /><br />So Dawkins rightly debunks the mythical, anthropomorphic God of religious fundamentalists, but then he uses their inane arguments to set them up as straw men representing the entire theistic worldview.  And then after he defeats these straw men (as easily as the Harlem Globetrotters used to defeat the Washington Generals) he parlays this victory into a validation of his atheistic worldview.  Dawkins (and every intelligent atheist) well knows that it is equally impossible to prove the inexistence of God as it is to prove that God exists.  As such, rather than providing convincing evidence to support his case directly (that God does not exist), he smartly sets out to debunk the most indefensible positions of his opponents and then he uses logic to convince the reader that if their anthropomorphic representation of God cannot possibly exist, then his opposing view (that God does not exist) must certainly be true.  To me, this is flawed logic and it is beneath someone as intelligent and accomplished as Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />Furthermore, Dawkins has entitled his book The God Delusion, suggesting the book provides a critique of a general belief in God, and on page 57 he supports this by saying \\"I am not attacking any particular version of God or gods.  I am attacking God, all gods... wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented.\\"  Yet a few pages earlier (on pg. 41) Dawkins writes: \\"My title, The God Delusion, does not refer to the God of Einstein... I am talking only about supernatural gods, of which the most familiar to the majority of my readers will be Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament.\\"  Notice that Dawkins makes an example of the concrete, easily falsifiable version of God of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), Yahweh, and he does not make any mention in the book of the abstract, immanent representations of God that come from the Eastern religions, like Hinduism and Jainism.  In these religions, God is believed to be an aspect of Self - one that is not separate from humans but hidden within each of us.  This notion of God is much trickier for Dawkins to disprove, which is why he doesn't touch it.  That's fine, but if he only intended to invalidate the God figure of Abrahamic fundamentalists (whether He be called Yahweh or Allah), then he should not have chosen a title suggesting a more broad invalidation of theism.<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />SPECIFIC CRITIQUES:<br />1) Dawkins' Estimates of Probability of God's Existence:<br />While in the process of highlighting his differences with agnostic philosopher TH Huxley, Dawkins suggests that while science \\"can neither prove nor disprove the existence of something does not put existence and non-existence on an even footing (pg. 72).\\"  He then goes on to suggest that while, technically, the existence of God is unknowable, he is quite certain that the probability of God's existence is so small that it might as well be zero.  However, in order to estimate the probability of something, you have to have a reasonable idea of the parameters of its context.  For instance, in order to estimate the probability that a tossed die will land on the number 6, you have to know how many sides the die has, whether it is a fair or weighted die, and it would help to know a few other environmental factors as well.  But it is reasonably within the scope of human ability to calculate or estimate these parameters, and thus we can establish a reasonably accurate probability for the occurrence of a tossed die landing on the number 6.  But when it comes to estimating the probability of God's existence, there are too many unknown and unknowable parameters to make any kind of a meaningful estimate about its probability.  What science has been able to document and measure about the universe is equivalent to a grain of sand on a beach a thousand miles long.  If you don't believe me, ask the physicists who study dark matter, dark energy and quantum entanglement, as well as the mathematicians who have studied the Turing Halting Problem and Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems.  Hence, Dawkins' estimation of the probability of God's existence being \\"very low [lower than 50 percent] but short of zero (pg. 73)\\" is little more than an arbitrary estimation without any significance.<br /><br />2) Doing Good.<br />There isn't a serious theologian that I know who believes that atheists are incapable of the same types of moral behavior as theists, simply because they do not believe in God.  Most reasonable theologians would agree that atheists are every bit as capable as theists of generosity and selflessness, and that, conversely, a belief in God does not necessarily predispose an individual to moral behavior.  In fact, history is replete with examples of those who, despite calling themselves \\"religious,\\" have committed abominable acts of violence - often in the name of religion - and most theists would concede this to be true.  But \\"doing good\\" is not a black-and-white issue, and it can be argued that there may be quantitative and qualitative differences in the \\"good\\" that is done by theists and atheists.<br /><br />In Chapter 6, Dawkins offers the following evolutionary hypotheses to explain why we are compelled by our genes to do good, independent of religious influence: 1)Altruism towards our offspring increases the likelihood of their survival, and thus the reproduction of our genes; 2) Doing good for others compels them to do good for us, which helps to ensure our own survival so that we can pass on our genes; and 3) The Potlatch Effect, which suggests that there is competition within social groups for the status of being regarded as \\"the most generous\\" in society because this projects our social (and genetic) dominance to the rest of society.  While these explanations provided by Dawkins are all reasonable and may all be true, none of them explain the types of altruistic behavior that many religious people engage in, including: forgiving those who have harmed you and \\"turning the other cheek;\\" practicing random, secret acts of kindness to strangers; and sacrificing one's life in benevolent martyrdom to save those who are genetically unrelated.<br /><br />To be sure, atheists are not only capable these types of selfless acts, but regularly perform them, unimpeded by their lack of a belief in God: however, there are a few caveats.  First, as Dawkins suggests earlier in the book, all atheists have been raised within the context of a religious culture, from which none of us can escape, and thus they have all been imprinted with religious philosophy.  Dawkins actually notes that among atheists in Ireland there is a running joke in which they often ask each other whether one is a \\"Catholic atheist\\" or a \\"Protestant atheist.\\"  Given the inescapable presence of religion in society, as well as the imprinting we all receive, how can Dawkins, or anyone else, be sure that the selfless, moral acts of atheists are not actually inspired by the religious imprinting they received from their various cultural influences?<br /><br />Second, it is reasonable to believe that religious groups provide their adherents with more reminders to engage in moral behavior than what secular society provides to atheists (or to any of us), particularly when it comes to engaging in moral behavior that has no direct benefit to them or the reproduction of their genes.  Religious life, unlike secular life, is based on a metaphysical system of lending: give unto others now (of your time, your possessions, your money, and even your life) and get repaid with interest (1000% if you believe the Christian Scriptures) in the next life, or for all eternity.  Hence, since religious adherents get more frequent reminders to do good, and also because they would seem to have greater incentive to do good (i.e., the prospect of eternal dividends), it is reasonable to argue that religious adherents may have more factors predisposing them to do good, more often, than do atheists (though atheists will argue, and rightly so, that their moral behavior is not tainted by the prospect of gaining a personal reward, and thus it is more pure).<br /><br />There is actually some evidence to support this, and this evidence was cited a couple of years ago by the New York Times columnist, Nicholas Kristof, in an article entitled \\"Bleeding Heart Tightwads.\\"  In the article, Kristof admits to trying to \\"shame [fellow] liberals into being more charitable\\" because, according to the data he cites, religious conservatives are twice as generous as secular liberals, even after controlling for income.<br /><br />But beyond the discussion of potential differences between theists and atheists in moral behavior, there is also reason to believe that the benevolent, enlightened societal goals of secular liberals may only be possible with significant contributions from religious adherents.  This is not my assessment, but the assessment of the famous German philosopher, and an atheist's atheist, Jurgen Habermas, in his book \\"An Awareness of What is Missing: Faith and Reason in a Post-secular Age,\\" which was summarized by Stanley Fish of the New York Times.  In the book, Habermas says:<br /><br />\\"Among the modern societies, only those that are able to introduce into the secular domain the essential contents of their religious traditions which point beyond the merely human realm will also be able to rescue the substance of the human... [as enlightenment rational morality] is aimed at the insight of individuals, and does not foster any impulse toward solidarity, that is, toward morally guided collective action.\\"  As such, Habermas laments that in the face of large-scale injustices (like genocide in Darfur or segregation in the United States), secular enlightenment intellectuals do not have \\"sufficient strength to awaken, and to keep awake, in the minds of secular subjects, an awareness of the violations of solidarity throughout the world, an awareness of what is missing, of what cries out to heaven.\\"<br /><br />This awareness is best exemplified by John Newton, the 18th century slave trader turned abolitionist (and atheist turned Christian) who, through the study of Christian theology later in life, came to renounce his profession and join in solidarity with the African slaves he once sold, leading him to write the famous hymn, Amazing Grace.  Once again, no reasonable person would argue that a benevolent atheist would not have acted as John Newton had.  However, just as an individual is more likely to exercise if he has a treadmill in his bedroom, I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that the regular reminders that religious adherents get - to examine their behavior (in the confession booth or anywhere else); challenge their selfish beliefs; and overcome their complacency - increases their likelihood of engaging in generous, selfless behavior.<br /><br />3) Qualifying Statements:<br />When individuals that Dawkins respects (e.g., Einstein or Stephen Jay Gould) are quoted in the book with statements that are dissonant with his atheistic arguments, Dawkins either explains them away as them being taken out of context or as being the unreliable consequence of a panicky deathbed conversion to theism: in other words, don't believe thesestatements because they are not valid representations of how the individual in question REALLY felt.  However, Dawkins does not extend the same benefit of the doubt to those individuals he does not respect (e.g., Rev. Fulton Sheen and Dr. Francis Collins).  When he quotes these individuals, he assumes that the written public record of their statements is an accurate reflection of how these people REALLY felt, and thus there is no need to qualify their statements with anything others, nor is there a need to provide any nuance in interpretation.  It strikes me as more than coincidental that Dawkins' allies always seem to get misinterpreted (and thus need him to contextualize or qualify their dissonant statements with others that depict how they REALLY feel), but yet Dawkins opponents always seem to say what they mean and mean what they say, and thus they don't deserve the benefit of him contextualizing or qualifying their statements.<br /><br />In either case, we can never know what a person truly means when they speak and this is especially true if we have no information about the context in which a person's statements were made.  We are all politicians, and scientists are no different.  Whenever we speak, the meaning of what we say is co-created by our actual statements and the context in which we make them.  There are many reasons why people may say things that betray their true feelings, including the need to sell something (like a book); or to drum up support for a particular cause (like a political campaign); or for social popularity; or simply to gain publicity for its own sake.  Dawkins understands this, which is why he tries to correct the record when it comes to those whom he believes are his allies in atheism.<br /><br />Hence, when Einstein says that \\"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind\\" and \\"God doesn't play dice with the world\\" - which are quotes that theists exploit to suggest that Einstein believed in God as they do - Dawkins provides other quotes that contradict these to demonstrate that these theistic statements by Einstein do not represent how he REALLY felt.  Similarly, when Dawkins discusses Stephen Jay Gould's argument in his book, Rocks of Ages, that science and religion have comparable jurisdiction over separate but equal realms of existence, Dawkins offers the following assessment: \\"I simply do not believe that Gould could possibly have meant much of what he wrote in Rocks of Ages (pg. 81).\\"  He then provides other quotes by Gould to invalidate these statements because they muddle his case against the existence of God.  But how does Dawkins really know how Einstein felt about God (I assume they never met, as Dawkins is likely too young to have ever met Einstein) and on what basis does he have to suggest that Stephen Jay Gould purposely betrayed his true feelings about religion in his own book?

B001CDWFPC|4.0|The quickness with which you can refer to different parts of the Bible is amazing. That alone comes in handy in all my study groups and services. The explanation points are also one touch away. That helps in the understanding of unstudied passages. I can also take it with me wherever I go.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|It is everything I would expect from Corey Taylor and more.  This is my favorite disc right now!  I can't wait for Part 2!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|For an old-timer like me, its real challenging. I struggled through the first round (untimed of course). I won the title of,  &#34;kind chief&#34;, or something like that. After all that hard work, I felt that I deserved more. Then I went out for another round, this time more difficulty, still untimed, now I'm stuck on the 2nd treasure chest, behind the 2nd door. I am confident, and Iwill prevail and win out, or have to be happy as a &#34;kind chief&#34;.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really loved this book. I found out a lot of things that the movie had different. I got it yesterday and I already finished it! I figured that I wouldn't like it since it was a classic, but I did. I really,really, liked this book. :{>
B009HV2JT8|5.0|thought it would be a b movie, but actually it was very good.  all of us enjoyed it very much
B008ENA74E|1.0|This book is like an insider look from the set of a favorite movie, from the perspective of the assistant caterer.<br /><br />Greg seems to have been in the middle everything, and part of nothing.  Much, much too much time is spent on his unbelievably boring background (spoiler: he's rich white kid from South Africa) and how super-thrilled he was to land a job at GS.  I thought this would be an exciting insider look into the most exciting decade at the world's most secretive bank  - but it reads like the life story of another privileged one-percenter who was born on third base and thinks he hit a home run.<br /><br />If you've seen Greg on TV, the book is exactly like his persona - plodding, inarticulate and a little bit miffed that his life is not even more awesome.  He has no apparent emotions or feeling of any kind, he makes gigantic events such as 9/11, seem dull.  And though he works the Derivatives desk at Goldman you'll have no better idea what those financial instruments are at the end of the book than you did before you picked it up.
1616960922|5.0|I'm a fan of Sanderson and I've read all his works.  I found this to be a terrific short story and I hope we get the chance to delve more into this world in future novels.
B000002H38|5.0|The smooth dancing, sing -a-long  music all the way driving back 2 Las Vegas leaving California. Going through the Tehachipi mountains is a bugger.
1476704163|5.0|Fantastic book!!! Glad to be an Animal!!!! Can't wait for Warrior!!!!  Great insight into Ke$ha's life past and present.  Great read and tons of great pics!!!
B001EC2IT4|5.0|No one will ever out do or out perform the Beetleman Michael Keaton created. This was one of his best performances. Although I maybe a little bias, as I prefer Keaton when he's playing more dark comedic roles. The comedy is better than your average slap-stick, and Catherine O-Hara is priceless as Deilia Deitz! Overall, its a great Tim Burton film, might be a little dark for the kiddies...but great fun for all adults. Beetlejuice will always be one of my favorites! Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!!! The ghost with the most!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|The game is stupid and the graphics are primitive.  I want to remove it from my Kindle. I want more games like popping stars that involve cerebral activity.
B002RSU9PY|5.0|This is a great classic movie and they just don't make them like this anymore.  Good story and great actors, well worth watching.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|copyrighting the people that created this obviously copied minecraft except minecraft is still better. they cant even let u look around good in games regularly they use the screen not a stupid button whatever that is.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|I watched it because it was recommended, but I wasn't expecting to like it.  I figured it would be silly.  But it was good!  Entertaining, I actually liked the characters, and the lead is hot, hot, hot.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|GREAT EYE, HAND COORDINATION GAME.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. REALLY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST IN GETTING TO HIGHER LEVELS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
0547884591|5.0|Buy this book and clear your schedule. It's huge and will overload you with information. But it's all amazing and exciting to learn.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I was very curious of what went down on the day bin Laden was killed.  I didn't realize that the book had more to it than the events of the actual DAY it happened.  There was a lot more to it, including the author's military career leading up to his participation in the action to get Osama.  Yet, I found the book to be interesting and at page turner.<br /><br />So, the title was a bit misleading, if you interpret it the way I did, but it was never-the-less well written and chucked full of action and information.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Highly recommend!  Great reading and a book you won't want to put down.  I love all three books in the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get it! it has good game play and is fun. not as good as fun as the computer one. still recommend it. waiting for the next update. last thing, worth the money. GET IT!!!!!!
B003D5FFY0|5.0|\\"All The Best\\" is all of the greatest songs I remember from my childhood. I bought the mp3 album even though I love to keep a hard copy, but the cd costs a bunch, so I went for the digital option.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I got this album along with Soundgardens new one... I find myself poppin' this disk in alot more... One word comes to mind when i am listening to this album. \\"Lush\\"... This is the Deftones best album from start to finish in my opinion. Not a weak song on the menu here. The transitions from Heavy to soft/atmospheric are flawless in every song. Upon listening to KOI NO YOKAN , their will be a voice in the back of your head telling you to play it again and again. Second best album of the year, right behind Down 4. The Purple EP.
0547884591|2.0|This is a decent book but not spectacular. It didn't change my life or teach me to be a chef - and I already know quite a bit about cooking. The \\"Good Eats\\" books are much better.<br /><br />I find it interesting that all the reviews for this book are 5 star. I was impressed UNTIL I noticed that all the reviews were submitted on the same day at almost the same time. So, I looked at what else the reviewers were reviewing. Most of them ONLY reviewed this book. Even those that had reviewed other items, had only reviewed one or two and they both got 5 stars as well. The reviewers must also be reading the same things because (of those few who had reviewed more than 1 item) most had also reviewed the re-educating millionaires and fit mom books.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/26/2012: Since some have wanted specific criticisms, here are some things I didn't like:<br />- There was quite a bit of old information - things that are either common knowledge or things that Mr. Ferris has presented before. Note, I'm not a Ferris follower but I like to pick up cooking tips when I can.<br />- The book felt thrown together, are we learning to cook or hunt or do science experiments? Apparently, all those things and much more and in a random fashion.<br />- Atkin's like diet advice feels very preachy. If I want diet or nutrition advice, I'll read a book by some one who has specifically studied nutrition.<br />- From the title, I would have thought the book would be mostly about learning to cook like a pro and the techniques pros use with a few interesting asides. Instead, there's only a little of that, a huge spattering of recipes mixed with a ton of information on many unrelated subjects.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I haven't written a review in a long time.  Why this album of all things inspired me to do so is beyond me, but I feel I must put my 2 cents in.  ADKOT is almost a year old now, and it's still in my rotation.  Has not left.  That is saying alot. Enjoy it just as much then as I do now.  It's not a throw away like some older bands have done in recent years (sorry to The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith), even if some of the songs are old (I'll defend those choices because what we've heard over the years were demos that were never allowed to be polished and refined).<br /><br />I was not a Hagar hater, but I doubt I'll listen to the Hagar years ever again after this.  All due respect to Sammy, he just isn't EVH's soul brother.  Like it or not, EVH and DLR are the one true match for this band. The secret ingredient that always made this band, was that the music was fun.  The Hagar years now seem like the band took itself way too serious. The music is fun again.  Dave is the same old goofball, and Ed is playing at his best since.....well.....since Fair Warning. I do miss Michael Anthony, but I'll live.<br /><br />Bottom line is, listen, enjoy, and have fun. Hopefully these guys can live happily ever after and keep ego out of the equation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Highly recommend!  Great reading and a book you won't want to put down.  I love all three books in the series!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|slow paced game or you run out of enery then have to wait. not bad if you are just killing time though.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I watched this on my tv via hdmi through my macbook. The only resolution available was low-quality and very pixelated. Excellent movie, I really enjoyed it. However, having paid $3.99 to rent it for 24 hrs seems very steep considering the quality, I assure you it was not my connection.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|As every other work of Ken Follet this is a good entertaining novel, well documented, good description of times and persons.
B003XU02QG|3.0|It started off pretty good but it could've had a better ending - like a lot of movies these days.
0060794410|5.0|I chose to order the audio version as I had a 4 hr drive ahead of me recently. Many subjects covered are clearly described and easy to understand. If you have ever been or are currently at a company with declining moral/financials/leadership this will reassure you that it is the company and most likely not you. If it is you, that will be uncovered as well for your own good though. Over a 6 decades of research conducted on corporate America in about 10 years time by a brilliant team. Every leader in any organization should be interested in reading this, most should be mandated to do so in my opinion.
B00881VLCE|3.0|love doing the puzzles but the apps crashes too much.had to uninstall and reinstall it 3 times intoned day. and download the puzzles I purchased
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Wonderful movie!!!!!!  Loved every minute of it.  Everyone should watch this movie.  Fantastic performance and filled with beautiful views.  Love it.
B005XN31LY|5.0|A great spin on the fairy tales we all grew up on . Can definitely tell folks from Lost are involved and who didn't love Lost. Great Show!
B003B02O0A|5.0|A very well written novel centered in the 50's-60's of a<br /><br />southern state and its traditions concerning the colored race. really enjoyed the look back in time and how our civilization hae hopefully advanced to equality.  Yu may not believe what you read but this was how it was. I think any man would defend his daughter as was told in this sttory or at least want too!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a wonderful wonderful story.  I think there is a second book coming out from his perspective.  Great romance story.  Enough angst and love and sex to keep you happy.
B004GKMV16|5.0|I found this book to be extremely engrossing and hard to put down.<br />It is superbly written, allowing the reader to fully immerse themselves into the history of one of the World's greatest city, while not being bored with the History of England which is woven suprebly into the story.[[ASIN:051743427X London]]
0316044695|5.0|Inspiring story by a true hero. A must read for anyone who is thankful for the freedom provided by those who choose to serve.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After first few chapterss the book became predictable and was hard to continue reading. The ending was quite disappointing .
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone and everyone who enjoys good tv. Hope it's around for a long time.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Great little game just the right amount of challenge. I have loved looking a bridge design from the time that I was a kid this brings back memories
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Everyone loves a happy ending and I'm glad this story had one too. Nice finish to the trilogy of books.
B009K0P10K|4.0|It has great acting and good script and good plot and the wardrobe is fantastic --the guys are cute, too!!!
0525953728|5.0|What a great book!!! I could not put it down. Finished it in two days. I'm glad they're on our side.
B00488SU02|5.0|Kevin Spacey gives one of his best performances in this story. It was not totally predictable,<br />But carried the message through so well, especially at the end. This is an outstanding film.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am devastated that he is still writing the next one. I love this series. Write faster pretty pretty please.
0525953728|1.0|There is nothing here that you didn't hear on the news.  Stupid book, don't bother, just ask your cousin, he's probably a SEAL.
0312567448|5.0|arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I will be sharing this with my grown daughter, making sure it stays on my shelf and doesn't wander off with her.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and truly learning about so many things. I wish I had the power to actually do the 30 days
B0052RDHTM|3.0|There have been previous ambitious sagas written spanning the years between WW I and WW II.  There<br />were the Lanny Budd books by Upton Sinclair, some of them written in real time as events unfolded<br />before the world.  Herman Wouk in the 1970's gave us the \\"Winds of War\\" series.  And now Ken<br />Follett is giving us a new trilogy covering the same period with the knowledge of hindsight.<br /><br />I must say that Mr. Follett's series so far as I have read does not come up to the standard of<br />the previously mentioned sagas.  This is not a dismissive condemnation at all.  I merely state<br />that my high expectations were not realized.  The fist novel, the only one which I have read so far,<br />is more on the level of John Jakes, another populizer of historical fiction.  Both Follett and Jakes<br />have provided a pageant of historical education in a fictional mode, which might be enlightening<br />to many readers about major events of the 20th century.  Jakes' \\"Kent Family Chronicles\\" tell<br />the American story of the new nation as it came into being and struggled to mature.  But it is on a pop<br />culture level.<br /><br />In Follett's novel the pageant is there, but the characters are developed so stereotpically as to<br />be merely skeletons of real people.<br /><br />I recently saw Mr. Follett appear on C-Span Book-TV.  His literary career is admirable, and he is<br />quite modest about his achievements.  I had not read his \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" but am quite fond<br />of the TV series derived from it.  I had been hoping for that level of excellence, and it was not<br />completely realized.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I am a huge fan of minecraft I love it but u cant do half the stuff as the Pc u don't have much land on Pc its unlimited land u cant harvest diamond or anything else useful u just cant do anything fun their are only snow normal and desert biomes no special you cant go to the nether you cant use Tnt or flint and steel I highly do NOT recommend this app but it is fun for simple builds waist of six dollars though if anything buy it for Pc and or xbox
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ending was fenominal!! Didn't see that coming. I just love the Hunger games and the series!!<br />So excited and can't wait for the movie sequel!  :)
B009GENZKS|3.0|The movie is in the same vain as the other animated movie...and taking that into consideration, the movie was entertaining.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|Same thing keeps happening over and over.  There is little movement forward, which makes it difficult to stay engaged.  It is very annoying to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is twisted. From the beginning you can tell that there is an extremely interesting dynamic between the two main characters. ... and it only gets more messy. Although it took a while to get really into the book, once you start part two it's hard to put down.
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl is a page-turner of the textbook variety, and I rocketed straight through it. It has compelling (though unlikable) characters, a strong and immediate hook, cliffhanger chapter endings and tension on every page. It was predictable in places and contained a few cliches, but all in all, while reading along I thought it was a great mystery/thriller.<br /><br />Then I hit Part III.<br /><br />(Major Spoiler Alert - seriously, if you haven't read the book and plan to, stop here.)<br /><br />Big, big, big bummer of an ending. Unsatisfying, anticlimactic and utterly frustrating after such a huge buildup. I didn't need the package all tied up with a neat little bow (inside joke - ha!), but I did want the dueling antagonists to learn their lessons, at least a little bit. Throughout the novel I tried to root for Nick, but he turned out to show shockingly little character growth considering the hell Amy put him through. I wanted him to grow a pair, and grow a pair he did not.<br /><br />I also would have liked some resolution of the Rand/Marybeth storyline. In the end, they're still goo-goo eyed for one another and their adoration of Amy is fully intact. Really??? Again, character growth was lacking.<br /><br />It's an entertaining read. It's just that the climax of the book is described very well by the author, through Amy's eyes, in the scene where Desi, um, climaxes.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|Was a great movie. Much better than I expected. Even my fiancé liked it! Will definitely recommend it to all my friends!
B007X04DQC|5.0|I had heard about this band from a friend. After looking at a few songs I decided to buy this album. Definitely worth it. I've had it for about two weeks, and I can't stop listening to it. If you like symphonic metal or something up that alley, you will probably enjoy this.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This app doesnt even open. this is ridiculous that you can sell these apps that dont even work it is so frustrating when you spend yoour money on thes apps and you are stuck with it and you loose your money....I am not happy...this is like the 5th app i have got that has ripped me off
B009LXEBD4|5.0|My CD arrived as promised in the mail yesterday. I had eagerly awaited this greatest hits CD. Her new song Catch My Breath is my life's anthem, as I can totally relate to it! I have followed Kelly since the first time seeing her audition on American Idol. She has continued to release songs that not only reflect herself, but ones in which her fans can also relate. Her other new song, Don't Rush (duet with Vince Gill), is slightly reminiscent of her early bluesy song \\"What's up Lonely.\\"  I look forward to hearing more music from Kelly in the years ahead. I am extremely pleased with this CD and I know that once I transfer the music to my iPod, it'll be on repeat all the time. Haha. :D
B007HACDLK|4.0|I'm only half way through the book and am already so frustrated once again with all of the grammatical errors. I cannot believe the publisher would put out anything with so many mistakes.  As good as Mr. Flynn is, he should hire someone to edit his books before they go to the publisher.  I'm embarrassed for him.  I'm also confused by a couple of story line issues that I can't reconcile.  The assassin is to be paid $3 million and the book refers to him getting it in 3 one million dollar installments.  Later he has second thoughts about the job and considers bolting with the 1.5 million.  Maybe I missed something but I went back and reread the sections and I'm still confused.  Then the assassin tells the folks interrogating him he didn't know his hit was on Rapp until he got to the hit location.  That isn't true.  He knew when he saw Rapp get out of the car earlier and got the text with his photo.  Maybe the guy was just lying, but that's not what it felt like when I read it twice.  I'm hoping to hear from someone who can either explain what I'm missing or confirm that these are in fact mistakes.  Regardless, the grammar alone is annoying.  And yet, I'm a huge fan and love Flynn's writing.  I just wish they didn't distract me with poor grammar.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I suggest you read the first book first, Fall of Giants can't wait for the final and third book. There is so much history some of it I lived through myself. I highly recommend the books.
B004V5A7K8|2.0|It's a typical \\"breakout\\" clone type game, with a bit of similarity to the \\"Araknoid\\" arcade game from the 80s. The graphics are a bit underwhelming for this sort of game as well and the gameplay is only okay at best. I still enjoy older style games quite often, however this particular one just didn't deliver. Thank goodness it was the free app of the day, as I would have been quite displeased had I actually paid money for this game. I subsequently deleted it from my device.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As always Grisham pulls out another good read. Interesting thoughts about innocent prisoners and the penal system. I recommend it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love a book that gives you a clear mental image and that you dont want to put down. I did not want to put this down. At the end of each chapter I said to myself..NO WAY. It is gripping and suspensful and unbelievable, if you buy only 1 book this year buy this one. I cant wait to read her other books!
0765326353|3.0|Sanderson has done a great job writing a thousand page book where hardly anything happens. Having bad things happen to a hero, and having him recover makes for a good book. Sanderson, on the other hand, decides to drag out the low point of the heroes life for some 600+ something pages of the hero being shit on while his situation doesn't really change despite the pages dragging on. Meanwhile there are a lot of fragmented flashbacks that should have never been split to so many pieces. This book would have been much more tolerable had it been condensed to 500 pages, instead of having it stagnate for a 1000.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|During the whole season of American Idol I kept saying \\"I hope this guy writes!\\" He wrote 9 of the 12 songs on this album. I am just as impressed with his writing as I am with his style. This is only his first album. I can hardly wait to hear where he goes from here! If I didn't know any better, I'd think this was the work of a seasoned professional...certainly not an American Idol winner's first album (no offense meant to American Idol, or any of the contestants). This guy is the real thing. Keep 'em comin' Phillip!
B008ULRY78|5.0|This movie was worth the money I paid. Nonstop action great fight scenes and a good story. Many of my recent favorite movies have been made by overseas studios. Not much faith in hollywood anymore..If you like violent action films this is a definite must have..Enjoy.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a very addictive game, and you can actually see the cards.  The ads that pop up between games are not so fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|hey i personally love this game even for 7 bucks the problem is that people r giving it bad reviews based on like it not downloading right or something listen thats a device problem not an app problem
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not a bad book,just another page turner.After a while Corey's asides became a bit trite.There were enough twists to finish the book,but a bit of a disappointment .
B0002HYHSW|5.0|Love this game! We play it with our 2 year old and 4 1/2 year old (with the younger child, we don't use the dice and just chose sticks to pull out from the ring). It is a great game for a carpeted floor (works best if it is on a rougher surface than a wooden table). We put the pieces in a ziploc bag and take it on trips - so compact and easy for travel, great for hotel rooms.<br /><br />I would also like to reinforce what another customer said about this game being highly effective occupational therapy. I had a friend with minor brain damage and she has been using this as part of her recovery.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very comprehensive, historical study of the political maneuverings by the storied individuals of that time. Sometimes, I felt, there were too many details, but they fleshed out the story of the rivals very completely.
0446519456|5.0|I love all books by Brian Weiss.  This book I read in one sitting.  Beginning to end.  I do believe we live many lifetimes, and sometimes with the same people in different rolls.  As for &#34;soul mates&#34; I've yet to meet mine in this life time, but I do believe we all have one.  I love the story here.  It was very exciting and I just had to know what happened to them.  It's a true love story.  They each went through a lot, but in the end, in this lifetime, they finally meet.  I guess there is hope for all of us.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game lots of stuff to do. its a little hard to figgur out due to no demo but once you catch on its a blast.
0316228532|5.0|This was a great book. It drew you in immediately, she developed the characters fabulously which some authors have a hard time doing with so many different characters.<br />I was apprehensive at first, which is why I put myself on the waiting list at the library to read it but I was pleasantly surprised.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I can't even get started with this game.  It's too confusing to figure out.  So poorly done.  Avoid at all costs.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book had a great plot-was well-written-fine characterization and held my attention from beginning to end.<br /> I recommend this to both men and women.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|It is the coolest movie trilogy EVER! My personal favorite, the 1st one is the best though! I Promise you
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a book for anyone who wonders what actually happened in Abottabod, Pakistan on that night.  Shows what real heros are made of!
1781163243|5.0|If you like concept art, and enjoy seeing game dev, ideas. Its a great coffee table book. If some one you know likes sci fi they will love this as a gift.
B009G41CG2|2.0|I only like Hoyle Mahjong.  I guess this will have to do unitl I can get that.  Very boring and not much fun.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I love this book.  Everyone should read it to really see what the men and women go thru to protect your freedom.  I have a son serving in the marine and several family members in other branches, so this book hit very close to home.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|except it was contrived, confusing at times, incredible, and generally awful.  I have officially jumped off the John Grisham bandwagon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead takes the zombie genre to a whole new level. Characters you can care about.  I am hooked. Caution: not for the squeamish.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I first remember seeing \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" in 1971 when a bunch of us college students went to see the cut-up(actually butchered) version of it in a small theater. I may have seen it when it first came out because I still have the movie program but I don't remember(I was 11 or 12). I was more into James Bond and Ray Harryhausen films than three hour epics. However, I do remember going with some people that I worked with to see the restored version in 1989 at the Cinema 21 in Mission Valley. We were spoiled in San Diego because we had not one, but six stand-alone movie theatres that could show 70mm films like \\"Lawrence\\". Sadly, four have been torn down while the other two were turned into a Staples and Bookstar(respectively). I mention this because you don't get to experience the real impact of \\"Lawrence\\" unless you see it in a theatre that can handle 70mm films. In fact, the last 70mm film I saw was Kenneth Branagh's version of \\"Hamlet\\"(1996) and prior to that was Ron Howard's \\"Far and Away'(1992). They just don't make films in this format anymore. Lean used it one more time for \\"Ryan's Daughter\\"(1970) but he he went back to 35mm for \\"Doctor Zhivago\\"(1965) and \\"A Passage to India\\"(1984). I mention all this because going to the movies, at least when I was young, was an event. I still remember seeing \\"The Ten Commandments\\"(1956) and \\"Ben-Hur\\"(1959) and being taken away by the scope of the production. With this new restored version of \\"Lawrence\\" finally making it to Blu Ray at least everyone can enjoy what it was like seeing it for the first time(aspect rato of 2:20:1)even though it's on a flat screen TV. Once you get carried away with the scope of the film, it feels like you're seeing it on a large screen. This Blu Ray is stunning to say the least and the restoration team at Sony deserves at lot of credit for the hard work they put into it just in time for it's 50th Anniversary. Having been to many of the locations in Jordan and Spain where Lean filmed most of the picture, I can honestly say that this Blu Ray feels like you're actually there. I'm not going to go into detail because there are other reviewers who can cover that better than me, but if you're a serious collector of films then you need to have this in your collection. David Lean's films are perfect subjects for Blu Ray and with this release all of his films since \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\"(1957) until \\"A Passage to India\\"(his last in 1984) have now been issued on Blu Ray. The only exception is \\"Ryan's Daughter\\" and hopefully Warner Home Video will get around to that in the future. This Sony release of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is definately on my list for one of the top Blu Ray releases of 2012 along with Paramount's \\"To Catch a Thief\\", Criteron's \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", Warner's \\"Empire of the Sun\\" and Universal's \\"Classic Monsters Box Set\\". For those who love great filmmaking, enjoy \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" in all it's Blu Ray glory.
B0090YHSFC|1.0|this is the worst app i have ever played. do not get this app. this is so boring and pointless. uggggh i hate it. it is not fun at all. do not get it!!!!!!!!
B003INBOE2|5.0|To say this is good for a foreign movie or to say that this is a good kung fu movie just don't do it justice.  This is just hands down a good movie.<br /><br />It has a compelling true story, set against the backdrop of the Japanese occupation of China.  Well filmed, with great action set pieces and a number of satisfying subplots, the movie is compelling from it's first frame.  The film is held together by a strong performance by lead actor Donnie Yen who radiates a serene and purposeful self confidence throughout the film.  Some of the action is over the top, but the film never loses it's footing in reality. Recommended.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Outstanding! Well worth reading. Hard to put down. This is one of his best. I without a doubt recommend this book
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Story easy to read, not to complicated and very interesting.<br /><br />A kind of book you can read on the beach during your holidays.<br /><br />I allways like that kind of easy going litterature.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is so additive that its crazy. My son tells me that this is the only game I play now and it must be my favorite
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The characters have become like old friends.  Their interwoven relationships combined with actual history sometimes telegraph plot lines but it still is engrossing enough to keep reading.  The only negative is the high price.  My Kindle edition was $20 and I will not purchase the third book at that price.  I will get it from the library.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I love reading about relationships and how it affects the society, people different points of view and how they just see same things in different ways. J.K. Rowling has demonstrated her power again!
B006H5120E|5.0|I wasn't sure if the 3 D effects would add to the movie but I think it did. Nice to find a 3 D movie that is not a cartoon, a documentary or about super heroes
B004I8WD6E|4.0|The case fits perfectly. A lip helps protect the screens edges. I dropped my iPhone several times and no issues at all. The screen protector helps protect the glass from scratches, but the protector itself takes on plenty of scratches. If you buy this case, but a better screen protector.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy the JC series.  This book did not disappoint.  Nelson DeMille, in my opinion, is one of the most prolific and entertaining authors in print.

B001KVZ6HK|3.0|Good 3 D effects.  I am not keen on superheroes but I purchased this DVD after reading other reviews. I am sure this is a good movie for teenagers or  anybody who is a fan of action superheroes.

B0034G4OYA|3.0|'Hotel Transylvania': More Monster High than Monster Mash<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Genndy Tartakovsky's work on \\"Samurai Jack,\\" \\"Sym-Bionic Titan,\\" and the unsurpassed \\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\\" shorts, so I was eager to see how he would fare as a director of a computer-animated film. As it turns out, his monsters have more bark than bite.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" isn't the animation (which is solid), the voice acting (which is amusing), or even the characters (which dutifully recall the monsters of yesteryear).  It's the entire premise for a family film: (one-hundred and-) 18-year-old daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) wants to see the world but her father Dracula (Adam Sandler) is terrified of humanity after his wife was killed by an angry human mob.  Humans in this world are the real monsters - you know, like \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" only with more traditional critters from horror movie canon.<br /><br />In honor of Mavis' upcoming birthday, all the family friends have been invited: Frankenstein's Monster (Kevin James) and his bride (Fran Drescher); a chubby mummy that's obviously based on the oft auto-tuned voice of Cee Lo Green; harried werewolf parents Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and Wanda (Molly Shanon); Griffin the invisible man (David Spade); and a litany of blink-and-you'll-miss it monster cameos. Drac decides to manipulate his daughter into staying at the hotel by terrifying her with an elaborate deception.  Then clueless traveling human hipster Johnny (Adam Sandberg) stumbles into the castle and suddenly Mavis' world is upended by evidence that humanity may not be that bad after all.<br /><br />The plot bumps along unevenly. Never mind that nearly every single main character was arguably human at one point - Frankenstein's Monster is made of humans (a running joke to explain how Johnny, disguised as another Monster, is distantly related), Dracula was human, the werewolves are presumably human some of the time, Griffin is still human, the mummy was...you get the idea.  Quasimodo is the chief antagonist (Jon Lovitz), but last I checked he was human too.<br /><br />The plot pivots on the \\"zing\\" - love at first sight, basically - but that concept is introduced before the big reveal of a gift from Mavis' mother that only reinforces what we knew all along about \\"zinging.\\" The idea that my little girl might fall in love with the first man she meets also rubs me the wrong way...Mavis can't just explore the world on her own, she has to fall in love with a man (sparing her father the horror of dating!) so she transitions from protective father figure to protective boyfriend.<br /><br />There's evidence of severe rewrites all over this script - since it's been in development since 2006 perhaps this is not surprising. It all culminates in a series of reveals and betrayals, which are resolved by our protagonists going on a road trip to reunite the two wayward souls.  Or at least it seems that way, until you realize that none of the supporting characters actually do anything at all.<br /><br />\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" regularly flirts with the difficult realities of monsters - at one point, Drac says, \\"I can't kill him, it would set monsters back hundreds of years.\\" But this is a PG flick, so even the notion of vampirism isn't considered, which is a shame.  It's probably the only way Mavis and Johnny will ever truly be together.<br /><br />Despite my qualms about the plot, this is a light-hearted love note to fans of monster movies and...their daughters. \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" hopes you fondly recall the horror movies of the past but not too much lest you remember that even vampires have to eat.  It's basically a paranormal romance disguised as a kid's movie..you get the idea.

B009GESJH2|1.0|... is largely composed of drunks, morons, rednecks, racists and meth heads, this is the kind of record you make. Bobby Ritchie understands his audience well and that's why he stretches himself to the edge of his competence to serve up tepid, barely there, utterly derivative songs that may catch but can never hold. In fact, a careful listen reveals that the boy's beginning to parody his own tired act.<br /><br />\\"Rebel Soul\\" is a sort of joke Ritchie plays on his audience ... and ultimately himself ... as he continues to rip off his own image in the name of \\"originality\\" ... there's nothing rebellious about this junk and there's certainly nothing remotely original about it. It's just the musical equivalent of boxed macaroni and cheese. Just add water and pretend it's something it will never be.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I like the main actors in this movie and had seen the trailer. It looked interesting but I found it a little weird. I'm having trouble classifying this movie. Is it about family dynamics, coming of age, or both? I liked Bruce Willis in his role because I could relate to his personal conflicts. But the other characters were really way out there. And I have to say the lead girl and boy were very strange. Really, children getting married and for what purpose? I would rate this movie 3 stars mostly because of the wonderful job the camera man (woman?) did. The scenery is beautiful.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of those can't put down books.  I don't know enough about the science behind the story to say if the author is making it up but two pages into the story, I don't care anymore.  The storyteller and the people around him are all that I'm interested in and Mr Weir has done a fantastic job in keeping that interest alive through the whole story.  I look forward to his next book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very fun game makes time fly but and very addicting and really neat how everything is. i cant stop playing
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've always loved DeMille's character John Corey, however he never stops his banter for a moment. Too much and not enough of a plot. The action doesn't start until more than halfway. Before that it's wordy and full.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|and the crowds they ran with.  Patti Smith's love for Robert Maplethorpe is so strong and it pervades all that she writes -- even when she is being brutally honest about his shortcomings.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|Red Tails is about the Tuskegee Airmen. Though it is well made, has lots of action and special effects, it somehow falls short of capturing the humanity of the men it honors. There is a bit of John Wayne &#34;sands of Iwo Jima&#34; bluster about it that didn't seem honest. This is the first film I know made about these heroes of WWII. I hope the next one allows them to be a bit more human as well. It IS worth seeing, though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I ended up purchasing all 3 books.  I enjoyed all of them and it ended up being a very nice love story.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|If you liked \\"Home\\" you will enjoy this album!  Phillip blends creativity, heart and soul, combined with incredible guitar playing and clever lyrics. I love that he's stayed true to his own unique style!  Have enjoyed listening to this since I downloaded it earlier today. Splendid background instrumentals! Too many \\"favorites\\" on this album to single out my favorite!  Love it!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the app but I cannot get the new update! its a good app overall and I would buy it again
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Absolutely love this series. I can't get enough of it. The story line is extremely well written and each character is interesting on their own. Can't wait to finish and start Season 3!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|One of the best story tellers of the genre' continues to experiment with character development and story presentation techniques.  No misses yet!

B007X709PE|5.0|this is a great way to waste time. nothings better than riding, but if thats not an option, put this on the tube and enjoy. this is an excellent movie that shows you more than you see watching a race or reading an interview. i think i paid 7 bux for it on amazon.com and it was well worth the $$.  if youre a motogp, road racing, or just motorcycle fan, buy it/ watch it.  you wont be disappointed.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book is very inspiring, it made me reflect on my own habits a lot. It contains excellent examples from many different areas (individuals, organizations, society). I enjoyed reading it and would stronlgy recommend it to anyone who is interested in how habits work and how they can be changed.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Love this game-my only issue is how small the pieces are! The aquariums are pretty, the puzzles are fun to play.<br />Wish it had more to unlock.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|Good, solid effort from the blues master. The CD arrived in the time specified and has many good tracks on it. If you like Joe,<br />you'll like this.
B002VQ7QBM|4.0|A well written book. An intriguing story line, with beautifully written characters. An enjoyable insight into the lives and journeys of migrants.
0525951652|5.0|I love this book.  I have just started reading it and I know I am going to love it!  I love how Ken Follett moves slowly through each character, building a story and putting the reader in the epic of that time period.  I will be sad when I'm done reading it!
1400069289|1.0|One thin idea stretched to breaking point over a bunch of chapters that have little or nothing to do with it. Laughable attempt to cover the neurology of free will in last chapter. Worst kind of simplistic, one dimensional moralising. The way he stood in judgement over the woman with the gambling habit made me gag. In a year when Khaneman published Thinking, depressing to find this junk on the same best seller lists. The very worst of pop-science.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|If you love good, LIVE rock and blues, you should add this to your collection. What can you say about Joe? He's simply an awesome talent.
B0063HBPH6|5.0|What a ripper ! Smart, sassy, funny, clever, in fact all of the things you would expect from a Neil Gaiman book.
0547884591|5.0|I am not a cook, chef, or anything of the sort, so I was skeptical. However, Tim Ferriss's writing is as enticing as that in his two previous books and grabs your attention even if you have no interest in becoming a &#34;chef&#34;. Get it, read it - you will enjoy it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome series. Bought book one separately then bought the omnibus. Then had to get book six. Great series and quick read.  It is basically a series of shorts that, put together become a novel. It hooks you right away and to can't put it down.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This Album was well worth the wait. It's possibly their Best Album Ever, can't stop play it. It's a must for any KISS fan
B008JGSM6G|3.0|At first it is really addicting,but after a while it gets boring. It's pretty short too. If you like puzzles,you should get Flow Free. It is good for a free app.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book really is an eye opener & was life changing for me!! Being in the fitness industry for 14 years now I've seen so many books about nutrition come & go. The whole concept of Wheat Belly really makes sense as we look at how our nation is becoming an obese nation. I have been 21 days gluten/wheat free & have never felt better...the recipes in the back of the book are great too!! Very informative, some may not like all the details of case studies, I however enjoyed the facts. I have reccomended this book to several clients & friends...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I enjoy all of Nelson Demille's books.  The Panther was one of the best yet.  It was excellent and I couldn't put it down.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|what I like was that Jacobs point of view was better than Bella's it was more emotional. This book was the best out of all of them!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the best app ever. It is better than any of the other building apps like Brickstory or Cavecraft. The seven dollars you have to pay is worth it. If you like building,get the app. Also,if you like action,this is the app for you. On creative mode,zombies are after you. You must craft swords to protect yourself,build shelters to rest,make pickaxes to mine,and build many things. On creative mode,you have lots of materials. You are able to build any thing you wish. Fight monsters and build great creations with friends on multiplayer. This is the best app ever.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|this book is a slight departure from john grisham's norm because it's not based on any actual cases (according to the author's notes).  It's fast-paced with a good balance between action & exposition.  the chain of events that *must* fall into place throughout the novel are just this side of stretch-the-imagination-believable.  loved it!<br /><br />more please, john.
B008VDJFFY|5.0|I loved this book and will be reading it again.  It was such a poignant beautiful story that touched me deeply.  The unfairness of life and the struggle that Layken and Will, both affected by their own family tragedies, have to face and because of their similar circumstances they find each other.<br /><br />Be warned you will need a box of tissues!  I loved Will's depth of character and Layken's strong sense of love and loyalty that develops for Will as the story unwinds.
B00913DPW2|5.0|must try if you are up for a challenge. great graphics and detailed walk through haunted house. I recommend for sure
B000VZP6LC|5.0|Excellent writing and acting.  Gripping, morally compelling, characters true to life.  Gave me insight into our legal system and appreciation for the legal profession.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Cutting the one long book into two shorter ones, each including half of the cast of characters, works to a degree.  It becomes slightly jarring when you start Book Five and rehash some of the opening of Book Four.<br /><br />Write faster, George!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Different for Diana but absolutely great..For a talented jazz singer and pianist this absolutely amazingbuy it you'll love it too
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I've taken up photography as a hobby that I have gotten more attached to over the past year. I started in a class and have branched out onto my own. A teacher told me I should look into color correction somewhere down the line -- if I wanted to get more passionate and serious about photography. I kinda shrugged off the comments. I never thought I would fall in love with photography like I have. I went to a wedding not too long ago and took a bunch of photos. Some folks asked for copies and I printed them out -- nothing too major. While printing them, I remember colors looking a LOT different from the event -- now I know what my teacher was talking about!<br /><br />I loaded up Xrite, don't use the software on the disc, go to the site for the lastest update. After going through the set up process (was a bit time consuming, but worth it) I saw just how off the colors were! Xrite made a HUGE leap in the quality and life like reproduction of color, from skin tones to clothes. I didn't realize how much a monitor can distort an image when you print. A valuable lesson has been learned and the Xrite is well worth the investment, even if you view photography as a passionate hobby.
0547884591|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tim Ferriss. He is a genius guru when it comes to efficiency. His first book \\"The 4 Hour Workweek\\" significantly changed my philosophy on life. The \\"4 Hour Body\\" helped myself and a couple friends lose well over a hundred pounds between the three of us. However, my biggest complaint about the first two books was that much of both books was not applicable to my life. I'm not interested in starting my own company or doing investing, so a lot of \\"The 4 Hour Workweek\\" didn't apply to me. Sure, the \\"Slow-Carb Diet\\" from \\"The 4 Hour Body\\" was helpful and one of the easiest diets to follow I've come across. But much of the rest of the book was just interesting information and not very realistic for me to apply (checking my blood sugar on a regular basis, taking a bath full of ice water, going to crazy extremes to live on barely any sleep, taking tons of supplements for various things, becoming an athletic/health god).<br /><br />In \\"The 4 Hour Chef\\", nearly everything is useful (we all eat and learn). A large portion of the book isn't even about cooking, it's about how to learn efficiently. It's far from a cookbook. It's actually a guide on how to learn efficiently, then step by step instruction via 20+ lessons on how to become a world class cook. In each lesson, you learn a new cooking skill, some insight about learning, and make a relatively simple \\"slow-carb diet\\" friendly dish that would feel right at home in any upscale restaurant in New York City. Each lesson builds upon the previous to develop a skillset. You'll get the most from the book by following the lesson path in sequence, and not by not skipping to whichever recipe looks the most tasty.<br /><br />Anyhow, this book is huge and every page is beautiful and filled with color. You'll regret it if you limit yourself to the Kindle version. This it one of those books that you need a print copy of, so you can flip through it with ease and appreciate the beauty that's gone into it. Only buy the kindle fire version if you want to read it cover to cover and don't want to lug around a huge college textbook sized copy. Anyways, best $20 bucks I've spent in a while. I would recommend this to everyone from the bachelor that can't even cook scrambled eggs, to the 5-star world class chef. I'm going to buy more for gifts this year.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have been an ardent reader of Nelson DeMille and I found this book to be: too predictable; lacking in the page-turning suspense (that I am accustomed to with his novels); and having a very perfunctory ending. I would really rate it 2.5 stars.  DeMille got lost on the road from Sa'naa to Aden and failed to deliver this time. The novel is slow and arduous and could have easily been cut down by at least 75 pages without altering much of anything. DeMille seems to have gone out of his way to provide an overabundance of witty comments by Corey and his colleagues to the detriment of developing an engaging plot with his trade-mark action and twists.  But without the comedic banter, the book would have truly been a sleeper. The lack of suspense cause me to think about putting it down and instead re-reading Plum Island, General's Daughter or The Lion's Game. However, I trudged along hoping that the book would take a turn and pick up, but it never did. Moving forward, his setup for Corey's (potential) future encounter with the CIA already has a deja-vous quality. I hope DeMille returns back to his old form in his next book and that his writing has not jumped the shark like many other well-read authors of his time.

B009HV2JT8|3.0|Surprisingly good. I had low expections for the movie. Ab Lincoln as a vampire hunter, really? But the plot keep me interested and the graphics were pretty good. Overall good movie I'd likely give it 3.5 if I could.

B002LB13SE|5.0|Normally remakes of classics are pretty bad but this one was great.  In fact I liked it even more than the original version.  I've already watched it several times and each time feels like I'm watching it for the first time.  It was well casted and held your attention throughout.  The parents were so cool with their vengence and I just love Tony Goldwyn.
145162445X|1.0|This is easily among the worst books I have ever read in a subject that is interesting to me.  The text is somewhat disorganized, flavorlessly written without any kind of style, and the presentation is just poor.  Among other things, one of the problems is that Krauss just makes the story about how the pieces fit together horribly boring.  I must also advise potential buyers and readers that there is a tremendous content issue, as well.<br /><br />The primary issue with the content can be seen in chapter nine, where Krauss shows his hand, indicating his motivation for writing the book: to establish ideological grounds that contradict, not just theologians, but philosophers.  The problem is that, after presenting the data in a disorganized way, explaining why there probably was a Big Bang, Krauss jumps (metaphysical) shark, basically demanding that the reader accept his bizarre definition of \\"nothing.\\"  In chapter ten, he defines nothing as something, which happens to be unstable.  I am quite ashamed that Dawkins backs up this line of thinking in the afterword, asserting that it is not \\"question-begging,\\" which is a boldfaced lie.  On top of this, we get conflicting facts about \\"nothing\\" from Krauss.  He says \\"under the right conditions\\" nothing can yield something, all the while maintaining that nothing always yields something.  The conditions that bring about these conditions, that is, the state that precedes the non-unique initial state(s) is what is of prime philosophical interest to philosophers and philosophers of physics.  This book is among the biggest wastes of money and time I have ever encountered, and it bothers me that there are a couple of us physicists that subscribe to views as presented in this book.  This book is emblematic of the kind of dogmatism that has lately arisen in the sciences, and which should be avoided at all costs.  Above all, a good scientist should adhere to the facts, and not go beyond the facts --a fatal flaw in this book.<br /><br />Since I often pick on scientists for making bizarre errors when they try to write histories of science or philosophies of science, I feel it necessary to add one, here.  Krauss seems to think Lemaitre originated the idea of the Big Bang, but it was Russian mathematician, Alexander Friedman, who was working on solutions to Einstein's equations.  I am pretty sure an article on this appeared in one of the American Physical Society's primary publications a little while ago, which makes this error the most bizarre of the ones found in the book: it suggests Krauss doesn't pay attention to APS publications.  I think Krauss would do much better in writing future books if he didn't try to do history and philosophy of science, worked on his writing style, and paid a bit more attention to the publications in his own profession.  Keeping his uninformed opinion to himself would be icing on the cake.<br /><br />(For a fuller account of the problems in the material, go to my blog via my amazon community profile, and look for \\"Why \\"A Universe from Nothing\\" Is Garbage\\" on the main page of the website.)/>Since I often pick on scientists for making bizarre errors when they try to write histories of science or philosophies of science, I feel it necessary to add one, here.

B008YWY0HK|1.0|I thought this movie was pretty bad, and I signed on to Amazon to tell people this because the trailer you see for this movie is completely misleading.  (Spoiler alert): It is not about a young girl who is courageous and fights for something realistic or anything like that, its simply about a girl who follows magic lights in the forest to a witches house and subsequently has her mother turned into a bear, and she spends the rest of the movie trying to turn her back into a human.  I am a big fan of pixar films, but this one, this one is just stupid.  And let me note, I expected a lot from this movie too, so that may play in to my 1 star review, the trailer looked really good, but its nothing like what the trailer portrays.
B009E9R2OK|5.0|First, this was a great concert and a great performance by Led Zeppelin in London in 2007.  The performance I think equals, or nearly equals, that assembled in The Song Remains the Same double-CD from 1977, I believe.  The set selection is excellent as well.  I don't think I've heard a better version of Trampled Under Foot- which gives you new appreciation for that song- and is worth the price alone.  But every song on the album is done well, if not among the best performances out there.  In any case, after listening to this Blu-Ray audio, it will be hard to ever go back to listen to the older performance again.  Here's why:<br /><br />The audio quality.  I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to finally hear Led Zeppelin as they really are - without the hollowed-out sound, no matter how many times its been remastered, no matter how good your audio equipment is, from decades past.  Right from the beginning of Good Times, Bad Times- the state-of-the-art recording, the chest-pounding bass, the full range of HD audio- it's amazing to say the least- and something every Led Zeppelin fan (especially those who have never been to a live concert- including me) must have.<br /><br />If you haven't listened to this disc, and have never been to a Led Zeppelin concert in person, you haven't heard the best of Led Zeppelin.  It's that simple.  A must have, without a doubt.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|Hi,<br />This is a must have for any android user. As the number of apps installed on Android device increase it becomes harder to find the right one through a long list of apps ( i have close to 200 apps on my phone). The folders we make on Android home screen are usually lost when we change launchers. That is where this apps. comes in. Just make labels and export your apps data. When you install a new launcher you don't have to manually make folders, just add the folder organizer widget for the right label and all done.
1608862801|5.0|\\"Adventure Time\\", despite being marketed as a children's show, is a surprisingly dark and mature universe. As often as there are lighthearted silly adventures, there are nuggets of sadness, anticipation, and dire seriousness in the stories. This comic, while being the first of what is to be a series, remains fairly lighthearted as much of the show, it successfully captures the humorous and simultaneously dark aspects of the cartoon. The visual feel of the book is lively and exciting and takes advantage of the medium in conveying the story to the reader. Bother children and young adults will enjoy this book and will look forward to the next installment.
184766895X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1J5QDAZPEZNG1]]<br /><br />NOW IN A NEW UPDATED EDITION WITH ACCOMPANYING CD<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Commercial lawyers will certainly bless this book, now in a new third edition via Bloomsbury Professional.  The beauty and of course the utility of the book -- as the title indicates -- is that the clauses -- boilerplate clauses to be precise -- are listed for ease of use in alphabetical order from `acknowledgements' to `warranties'.<br /><br />This feature alone is a boon to the busy lawyer, or indeed anyone tasked with drafting a commercial contract. (One of the better known clauses in this alphabetical list is `completion' pertaining to the sale of real property.)<br /><br />But what exactly are `boilerplate clauses?'  Although the term generally defies precise definition, the co-authors Mark Anderson and Victor Warner state that it's used broadly to mean contract terms that are found in commercial agreements, almost irrespective of the subject matter of the agreement. Usually found toward the end of an agreement, they quite often are not necessarily concerned with its subject matter, or its main purpose.  Nonetheless, as the authors imply, you ignore or dismiss such clauses at your peril.<br /><br />Failure to consider (or understand) all the provisions of a commercial agreement (even the \\"boring \\"ones)' [i.e. boilerplate clauses] say the authors, can have serious consequences - hence the value of this book, which also examines a selection of other contract clauses frequently encountered in many types of commercial agreement.<br /><br />This new third edition has been written as a practical guide (rather than specifically a legal textbook or casebook) for practitioners frequently faced with the challenges posed by boilerplate and other commercial clauses in their everyday commercial work.  Following on from the two previous editions, this new one provides additional explanations and commentary on the legal principles which underline a boilerplate clause.<br /><br />Other new material includes sections on data protection, freedom of information and good faith and much more besides.  The book also provides extensive tables of cases, statutes, and statutory instruments, plus an appendix which features a sample boilerplate agreement and detailed index.<br /><br />Primarily this is a useful practitioner guide to an often confusing, yet crucially important area of law, although the authors are careful to state that it is not a general guide to negotiating or drafting contracts.  For that they recommend their book `Drafting and Negotiating Commercial Contracts' also published, like this particular volume, in 2012.planations and commentary on the legal principles which underline a boilerplate clause.<br /><br />Other new material includes sections on data protection, freedom of information and good faith and much more besides.

B004TTHLBE|4.0|American Gods lost something in my recent re-read. I'm not sure what it was exactly, as it's been so long since I last read it. However, this time around, I simply didn't enjoy it as much. An enjoyable read, but not the classic that I remember.<br /><br />Maybe it's just that everything looks better through the lens of imperfect memory?
0425263916|5.0|I think this book was amazingly good!<br />If you manage and look behind the erotic parts, you will find a love story most of us yearn for. Someone who is willing to love you for who you are, with all the faults and blemishes.Someone that can truly see and love you for who you are..<br />The story went straight to my heart and I could feel the longing, the love, the strength of the raw feeling that is struggling in both. I would recommend to you this book comes highly recommended! Love frome Norway

B005LAJ22Q|4.0|I like zombie movies, but I'm also one of the first to admit that the genre can become trite after a time, generally becoming a nihilistic romp of rag-tag survivors trying to evade a never-ending horde of shambling dead where the variations are minimal. Until \\"The Walking Dead,\\" that is. Dragging the format out to a weekly serial allows for more time to explore the social and psychological effects of surviving a zombie apocalypse. I love the second season particularly because the undead are not the worst thing out there. The disintegration of the group and perpetual ethical quagmires of a changing world and society dominate the theme of the second season, creating much more than a gore-splattered thrill ride. Combine that with an excellent cast and crew who draw you into the drama and tension with a masterful skill and spectacular visual effects and it works to make this one of the best damn shows I have ever seen in any genre and a must-have for zombie lovers.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|These are my boys. Been digging on them since they started...since my High School days in the 70s. Have barely missed a tour, know their catalogue start to current and this new album (they'll always be albums to me) is fantastic! Every listen I like a new song, a new riff, a new rhythm , and of course the lyrics. Always a treat to hear Tyler and company play around with words and the music.<br /><br />At first I winced at the idea of a duet, and with Carrie Underwood no less - but damn it! I'm humming and singing the song already! This album is a treat start to finish. Classic rock revamped and turned on its head. This album is a lesson in how true Rock is done. It stands up with the rest of their catalogue.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned Aerosmith can do no wrong. Best damn band ever! And now that we're all old I look forward to all of us getting older and rocking our chairs right off the porch into the bliss that is Rock and Roll!<br /><br />Long live Aerosmith and long may they rock and show the kids how its truly done! Youth be damned!

No matter where you hail from, Mr. Fox has probably touched on your neighborhood or someplace nearby or similar in his cross country search for answers.<br /><br />If you have more interest after watching, not enough time to watch, and especially if you are in or near NY State, 'The Sky is Pink' is a great short that's as made after 'GASLAND' to address the current fracking debate in NY.

0375507256|3.0|this book takes you on a whirlwind of many different characters, locations, time periods, situations.  it's really multiple books crammed into 1.  i think i would have liked it more if the book was split up into the different stories.  since it was all in 1 book, i found it hard to follow and at times, frustrating.  how on earth, i wonder, can this book be turned into a movie without people throwing their arms in the air or walking out?!  i'm amazed that david mitchell was even able to fit all this into one portable book.  i think the overall theme of the book, which i believe is how every individual, no matter how low profile, famous, evil, weak, makes some sort of mark in the universe and in turn, affects other lives.  this might be interpreted differently by everyone but that's what i got out of it.  based on the theme, i think this is a good book and is worth a read.  i'm very impressed by david mitchell's ability to keep all the stories and names straight.  he also does an incredible job of perfecting dialects as well as creating his own dialects.  very imaginative.  can't wait to see the movie now.
B009OA57MI|5.0|have played for just an hour on the free version but I liked so much I purchased the full version.  fun game with settings that work well.  again I am new to this game but it is pretty great.  I am really pleased.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Wish it would update more and have different features, just figured out how to go to my most recents updates. Not a big fan with the app.
1423140605|4.0|What I Liked: 1) The characters are finally all coming back together. This is what I've been waiting for since the first book came out - to see Percy and Annabeth back together, along with their new friends, Piper, Leo, Jason...among others. Seeing how they will all get along, or perhaps not get along was one of the driving parts of this story. 2) It was fun to get to know what was happening at different places at the same time. I was wondering how that would be done, now that we are aware of what's been going on with Jason and Percy. Mr. Riordan did a nice job with keeping the reader informed of everything that was happening, despite the characters being a little...all over the place. 3) How smoothly we slide from one story into the next. What I am always pleased about with Riordan's books is how seamlessly we move from book to book. Despite there being nearly a year between books, we pick up right where we left off.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: The story is getting a little too...convoluted for me. Now that there are so many characters to keep track of, which we knew would happen right from the beginning, it's getting a little hard to tell what is happening where and to who. This story is narrated in the first person by four different characters and y'all know that sometimes I struggle with two narrators. So my biggest complaint is that it is becoming to convoluted.<br /><br />Overall Thoughts: Mark of Athena is an excellent continuation to a story that I've already fallen in love with. The historical Greek and Roman references, the mythology, and even the characters fascinate me in a way that few other books have. I have a feeling that I'm just going to have to deal with the multitude of narrators if I am going to continue reading this series, which I am. Just be prepared for a lot of jumping around.
0525958002|5.0|A must read for true Duran fans and anyone who wants to get a behind the scenes look at the life of a talented but humble musician that established one of the most significant super groups and made a profound impact on music and fashion as we know it. This book was a &#34;pleasure&#34; to read! He told his story with honesty and with class. It further solidies my respect and admiration for this incredible artist.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson Demille had me as a fan from the first time I read one of his books.  That was The Gold Coast.  As an American woman and a student of Middle Eastern Dance I found this book both amusing and informative.  Who can resist the protagonist's sense of humor?  The position of women in the Middle East is accurately portrayed.  The non-stop action is addictive.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is neat now I can see what the weather will be doing and see what it is doing in other states where family is.
B004LX0D36|4.0|It is remarkable how the women of the period had to put up with so many different pressures then of today. Consider that there was little of entertainment other than board games back then. Or why else would all these women engage themselves with so much frivolous talk and innuendo. With nothing to do for a &#34;career&#34; than to find the right man to marry, what else was there to do? It is a interesting picture of the times. The woman's honour having to be at stake if they chose wrongly. Marrying into money, and caste never mind the female biology. But at a few times the women gets together had gossip like hens while others suffers in silence. The illustrations were a nice touch too.
1400067936|3.0|What the book is about: \\"this book is about luck disguised and perceived as nonluck (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism).\\"  Nicholas Nassim Taleb also includes some excellent discussions (when I read Taleb, I feel like it is an actual discussion with an incredibly engaging interlocutor) on the distinction between 'noise' and 'message', on invisible histories, on noncomputational math, on Monte Carlo simulations, on the toxicity of information, and so much more.<br /><br />Yet, a reluctant three stars. What's the probability of that? The research, the scholarship, the sheer breadth of Taleb's interests are remarkable. It seems though that some unconscious irony is at work here: \\"Fooled\\" is much too rambling a read for a treatise on randomness. His illustrations occasionally feel arbitrary, even rushed, not completely fleshed-out. Which for the non-specialist, for the dilettante, makes this a tough row to hoe.  We, the benighted, need to be able to get our hands around these principles with examples drawn from something other than Wall Street. He leans heavily on the relevance of the topic in the realm of trading and markets, most of which was, frankly, uninteresting, if you're not deep into that world.<br /><br />You have to, however, love his irreverence. There are no sacred cows in Taleb's world of high finance. He doesn't pull any punches when it comes to identifying half-baked economics 'research' that tries to pass itself off as hard science, and the resultant over-inflated egos (and bank accounts) of those who benefited greatly from market randomness. His verdict: they're not good, they're lucky.  I've always believed that and now I know that my lucky guess was right.<br /><br />So much to admire, so much to learn here. If only it felt a little less like your crazy uncle who's trying to get a long story out but is constantly glancing back over his shoulder just in case somebody's sneaking up behind him with a cream pie. \\"Fooled By Randomness\\" is a little all over the place.<br /><br />\\"The Black Swan\\", Taleb's subsequent treatment on related material, possesses a greater focus and broader applicability, in my opinion. The books work well as a series: something I'm learning was not random, but intentional.<br /><br />Recommended to CEOs who can read, and to people who are looking to make sense out of why the world can seem so arbitrary.  Buck up, son.  It doesn't just 'seem' that way.king up behind him with a cream pie. \\"Fooled By Randomness\\" is a little all over the place.<br /><br />\\"The Black Swan\\", Taleb's subsequent treatment on related material, possesses a greater focus and broader applicability, in my opinion.

I immediately wrote down their name and listened to the album sampler on amazon. I was hooked with every song. I do not regret purchasing this album. It's perfect, you can listen to it while driving in the car, or laying out on the beach, at night to go sleep, for a romantic dinner, or just to relax at home, even while at work. this \\"dream-pop\\" genre is the best.

014241493X|5.0|I recently had the pleasure of reading Paper Towns, a contemporary realistic mystery by John Green. Margo Roth Spiegelman, a beautiful girl in the cool-kid land of Quentin's high school happens to have been his neighbor since they were nine. With the regular excitement of living next to the popular girl, things are a little different when that girl is Margo Roth Spiegelman.<br />Q's neighbor often disappears on road trips for a couple of days and leaves random clues leading to her destination. After a night of playing pranks, with Quentin as getaway man, Margo is gone longer than ever, leaving ominous clues behind that are meant only for Q. This calls for a road trip of his own to find out what happened to his ninja neighbor, for better or for worse.<br />The hilarious adventures of Quentin and his friends will keep you laughing out loud on every page. I would recommend Paper Towns if you like suspense and a good mystery. It is a book that is very hard to put down and very easy to reread.<br /><br />---Gwen Johnson

B009KNPM9W|5.0|3 Cheers, a toast of Dom and a 15 minute standing ovation as the final entry into the expanded editions of Marvin's golden era is finally here in time for Thanksgiving 2012. Like millions of others, \\"What's Goin' On\\" felt like the soundtrack of my formative years. Coming right during the spring I graduated from high school, okay yes I'm near ancient, I declared it as my \\"Best Album of All Time\\"!!!! It wasn't necessary for Marvin to follow it up right away because I listened on a daily basis, never tiring of it.<br /><br />But then, after dropping the single \\"You're the Man\\", Marvin made a complete left turn and expressed his musicality and jazz instrumentation with the soundtrack to a 70s movie that I never had any intention to of seeing, \\"Trouble Man\\". What I liked about the album immediately was the challenge it brought to my musicality. It was another opportunity to expand my musical knowledge. I had followed Santana's transformation into jazz at around the same time with \\"Caravanserai\\" and \\"Love, Devotion and Surrender\\" with John McLaughlin. (\\"You're the Man\\" may have proven that it was impossible to top \\"What's Goin' On\\". It is not like there wasn't more to say about any of the number of topics that album presented. I anxiously wanted a follow- up or so I thought. But it was clear that he had made such a definitive statement that, for the time, all that could be said, Marvin had said).<br /><br />Diana Ross had offered the Great American Songbook via Billie Holiday's vast repertoire. And that was jazz and blues with vocals. Marvin was stepping into a jazz soundtrack possibly closer to Quincy Jones' early A&M releases. It was different from the transcendental jazz that Santana was venturing into. Where Berry Gordy may have initially resisted \\"What's Goin' On\\", with its political leanings, I would have thought that he was particularly excited by his achievements on \\"Trouble Man\\". It was a percursor to \\"Round Midnight\\".<br /><br />Somehow Marvin manage to achievea Top 10 Pop and R&B single with the title track. This would greatly assist the soundtrack's ultimate success where the movie may have underperformed. In a fascinating way, the single could also have been autobiographical. Interestingly, Marvin would begin to experiment with acting in little known movies like \\"Chrome and Leather\\". Though \\"Trouble Man\\", the film, did not come through Motown Industries, Inc like \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\", it would have been interesting to see Marvin in the lead actor role that Robert Hooks assumed.<br /><br />Though there was no follow-up to the lead single, it would have \\"T Stands for Trouble\\" as an instrumental candidate. Funky and rhythmic, Marvin, like Stevie explored the world of keyboards and synthesizers. Radio in 1972 wasn't that adventurous save for the new medium, FM. The FM band could have possibly rotate a few of the instrumentals on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Prior to \\"What's Goin' On\\", I was naive to the fact that Marvin had written such modern day classics, \\"The Bells\\", \\"Baby I'm for Real\\" and/or the sublime \\"If This World Were Mine\\". Marvin's formidable talent as a songwriter/producer was only eclipsed by his ability to play a variety of instruments with The Funk Bros. on the soundtrack to \\"Trouble Man\\". \\"Trouble Man\\" was another great entry into Motown's transformation into an album label in the 70s. Just as Stevie and Diana had spread their creative wings, followed a little later by Smokey, Marvin reinforced his position with the Mount Rushmore of the Motown stable. \\"Trouble Man\\" remains as proof of the talent of the Motown stable that would evolve and blaze throughout the 70s.

B000SEGUDE|3.0|Reviewing Cloud Atlas is like reviewing a set of short stories.  Do you have to like them all to give it a review, what if you only like a few, does that warrant 4 stars? 3 stars? What if you absolutely love one and hate the rest?  What does your review say of whole, if you only liked a small part?  Does a malfunctioning engine get a pass because it has a few pretty screws?  This is the dilemma I face as I write this review.  The only logically, manageable way to review this is to review each story rather than the whole.  So hear goes:<br /><br />1. The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing:  3 stars: I found this to be a nice intro, and a good scene for an opening.  Who doesn't like stories about old sea adventures?  However, great the intro, this story is hollowed out both by the journey's purpose AND the stories sudden antagonist.  I didn't like the way this ended at all, but it definitely serves to solidify the narrative that what starts well, ends badly, and vice versa, BUT, even in that bad, there is a small light that is passed on to the future.  This will be the ever present narrative through out the novel.<br /><br />2. Letters from Zedelghem: 3 stars: Again, we have a light hearted witty funny little story to begin, turned into a total disaster and tragedy by the end.  I'm not sure if the little light at the end of the tunnel is so great in this one.  I felt this story above all, had the most hopeless ending, but at no point did I ever like or identify with the main character Frobisher, so his nasty end didn't greatly impact me.<br /><br />3. Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery:  5 stars: This is where the book really shines in my opinion.  And here we start to see the fundamental shift of things starting off badly, and ending well.  I felt like this truly was the novel Cloud Atlas, and all the other stories just feed into this one great story.  I really liked the characters and related to them, and I liked the \\"murder mystery spy novel\\" approach to it.  This story just felt good all around, and to be honest, was the only thing that kept me reading this entire novel from front to back.  I still feel that the author perhaps would have been better off just expanding this story into a full novel.  I think that novel would have been great.<br /><br />4. The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish: 2 stars: This one was hard, I LOVED the beginning, and wanted so much to like the ending, but it was just so long and dragging at the end, that I started skimming and just wanted it to end.  I love the british style humor, and most of the characters were great, and I love the idea of being trapped in an institute and making a daring escape.  Kind of like a feel better version of One Flew Over the Cukoos Nest.  But the ending still killed this one, and ended up as the most disregardable of the 6.  Pity.<br /><br />5. An Orison of Sonmi~451: 1 star:  Total crap.  From beginning to end, I couldn't see the point of this story.  I didn't like the interview style narrative, could NOT get into the characters, nor could I even visualize this Sonmi as any kind of messianic character.  I'm sure that buried deep in this story is some kind of profound story, but it completely lost me.  This was the worst of the 6 for me, and only served to add more pages of bloat to this novel.<br /><br />6. Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After: 3 stars:  Here is what the author intended to be the center of the story I'm sure.  But compared to Luisa Rey, I feel that the average person will overlook this story due to its odd characters and really abrasively written narrative.  The story here is rich and compelling, but the writing style, particularly the harsh dialect used to tell this amazing story is so fragmented and off-putting, that its as if the author himself sabotaged this story at birth.  Where is it written that peoples of the far future must talk a stupid garbled english that's impossible to read?  Why could this story not have just been written plain?  I have no clue, but it wrecked the presentation for me.<br /><br />So, there we have it.  What I felt held up and brought down the central concept of this novel.  The novel is good, the writing is great, most of the characters are fun, but ultimately, the novel still lacks more than it accomplishes.  But, to be fair, it was an ambitious project, and its easy of me to knit pick it in hind sight from a far, because I have those advantages.  I give Mitchell credit for having this great idea for a novel, and trying his best to present it, but I think he needed help bringing it all together, and from what I've heard, perhaps the movie actually does this a bit better than he was able too.  I shall see.?  I have no clue, but it wrecked the presentation for me.<br /><br />So, there we have it.  What I felt held up and brought down the central concept of this novel.

You've got a new Fan.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel(released Feb/12)stars some impressive British acting talent,such as Judi Dench as Evelyn Greenslade,Bill Nighy as Douglas Ainslie,Celia Imrie as Madge Hardcastle,Penelope Wilton as Jean Ainslie,Maggie Smith as Muriel Donnelly,Tom Wilkinson as Graham Dashwood,Ronald Pickup as Norman Cousins,along with others.These talents alone would have assured success in any film they all appeared in at once,but the film almost derails itself with a sub plot of love between the hotel owner Sonny and his girlfriend,who must stand up to his domineering mother,and all the little nuances each character brings to the table,and which must be pieced together and tied up in the end.As the film rolls along we get an endless hopping from one person to the next and when any of the stellar British actors are not on screen,things tend to get slightly tepid.However the film finally manages to pull the entire story together in the end,as bitter sweet as it is.<br />The story finds one couple and five singles,going to a hotel in India,as the brochures of it look mighty appealing.Each one has their own travails and reasons for going.For the Ainslies,the husband had invested their entire retirement savings on his daughter's internet company,for start up funds,which has gone nowhere fast.With funds short,they decide to vacation at the Exotic Marigold.Evelyn is a widow which must sell her flat to pay her late hubby's bills.With what's left she decides to vacation.Madge is a single lady who is out looking for a mate,and decides India might be the change she needs.Muriel is in need of a hip replacement and the hotel is used to put her up as she convalesces.Graham is a newly retired judge who is sick and returns to the land he knew many years before.And finally Norman is an old bachelor looking for that one last good fling.<br />When the group arrives,they discover the hotel is a decrepit old thing run by a young man named Sonny,who took it over from his late father.Sonny is constantly looking for a cash influx to expand,but cannot get the backing of a local businessman.On top of this his love life is combative:with his mother.She wants an arranged marriage whereas he loves another girl and wants to marry her.Muriel is a crotchety old bird and at first talks very little to anyone.After her hip replacement she becomes friendly with one of the hotel servants and the film expands on their relationship.Mrs.Ainslie is a moaning Minnie to everyone within ear shot.She gets a crush on ex judge Graham but it becomes unfulfilled as Graham it turns out is gay.Evelyn gets a job in a local call center teaching the employees how to properly deal with English customers;which she loves.Both Madge and Norman both hunt for that certain love affair,with totally different tacks.The ex judge,seeks out and finds an old friend who he was closerthanthis with years before and they reunite.<br />When the film starts its descent towards the finale we find Sonny standing up to his mother and vowing to marry his sweetheart,as,it turns out,his father did for his own mother years before.Madge and Norman each find love in their own respective styles and stay on.Mrs.Ainslie finally leaves the hotel when her daughter sends some unexpected funds to them.Their marriage was on the rocks anyways and while she departs,he instead stays on.Douglas and Evelyn created a connection during their time together and he returns to her and asks her on a date.Muriel has been a busy beaver and has looked into the viability of the hotel,which Sonny's mother wanted to close.Muriel instead says the property is viable and sets about co-managing it with Sonny and it prospers.Finally,and unfortunately,Graham had a bad ticker and passes away after his reunion with his old and dear friend.His friend gives him a proper Hindu funeral.<br />The film has seven people,eight if you count Sonny,all with problems and travails to work out.That is alot of detail to introduce,tell and properly wrap up all within the just over two hour time frame.And as I said,when this great cast of veterans isn't on the screen,the movie slows down,as good as the Indian cast is.So what could/should have been a top notch character study film,almost gets derailed because of the amount it has to tell and the way it is ultimately told(edited).<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.The extras are two 2-3 minute glorified trailers on the film and commentary.<br />All in all this film is a film that should have been better than it was,but it just had too much to tell and wrap up.The British cast was nothing short of marvelous,but even they couldn't propel the film any higher because of the aforementioned faults.3-3 1/2 stars.ll within the just over two hour time frame.And as I said,when this great cast of veterans isn't on the screen,the movie slows down,as good as the

B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books ever. Period. Go read this book. Its a great coming to age story. It is very emotional. And super easy together in to.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I thought the movie mostly followed the storyline.  I am usually not impressed with film adaptations of books but I thought this one was pretty well done.  The graphics were terrific and the action was non-stop.  Of course, having read the book, the story was easier to follow than for those who jumped straight into watching the movie first.  I can't wait to see Catching Fire and Mockingjay.

B001VLBDD0|4.0|Terminator 2(released July/91)stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the terminator,Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor,Robert Patrick as the T-1000 terminator,and others.Ah-nold spawned yet another iconic movie phrase when he came out with \\"Hasta la vista, baby\\",but I forgot that it wasn't his character that first came out with it,it was the young John Connor that told him to say it.It is rare that the first movie in a franchise is equaled or beaten,but Cameron went on to top his first work in the franchise with this one.It features another heart pounding almost continual pursuit of Ah-nold and those in his care.<br />The story finds two terminators this time around,\\"beaming\\" back in time,surrounded by the usual electromagnetic arcs.One is Schwarzenegger,and the other is Patrick.Patrick is a new and improved T-1000 model,whose structure is liquid metal.He can morph into just about any form he wishes.Patrick is the bad terminator,as his mission is to kill the young John Connor.Ah-nold is the terminator sent back to protect John,and we learn this turn about,about the same time the characters do.<br />Sarah's son John has been in and out of foster homes for quite some time,while Sarah is locked away in a mental institution.Ah-nold reaches young John in a video arcade,just as Patrick is about to do his duty.They escape and young John has to order Ah-nold to go rescue his mother.Ah-nold warns that Patrick will be there also,but that doesn't deter young John.When they get to the institution Sarah is in the midst of breaking out herself.She is terrified when Ah-nold shows up and her son has to reassure her that he is on their side.They all barely escape with Patrick,once more,in hot pursuit.<br />The trio flee to Mexico and regroup there at an old friend of Sarah's.They get weapons,ammo and some much needed rest.They then decide that it is the creator of the advanced micro chip,Dyson of Cyberdine Industries,that must be stopped.Dyson has reverse engineered his chip from what was left of Ah-nolds body from the first film.Sarah goes off ahead of John and Ah-nold and tries to assassinate Dyson in his home.She even gets so far as to invade his home and hold him at gunpoint.But with his wife and child there she cannot bring herself to pull the trigger.Ah-nold and John catch up with her and they sit Dyson down to explain the consequences for the future of his work.Dyson gets the trio into Cyberdine and they set about to destroy all remnants of his work so far.The police of course arrive and while Sarah,John and Ah-nold high tail it out,a wounded Dyson sits next to a detonator which he eventually sets off.<br />Patrick,in hot pursuit of the trio, end up inside a steel mill,where the final showdown occurs.As Patrick walks through torrents of liquid nitrogen from an over turned truck,it starts short circuiting his ability to shape shift. Once inside he eventually corners Sarah and John.Sarah empties her shotgun into Patrick,but runs out before she can execute the coup de gras.<br />Ah-nold appears just in time to save the day sending Patrick into a tank of molten steel,in which he disintegrates.Ah-nold is the last remnant of future technology left,and he asks Sarah to lower him into the tank so he can be destroyed.The film ends as Sarah ruminates on a better future for mankind.<br />Filled with then,state of the art CGI and morphing techniques,Terminator 2 still stands out as an excellent film today.Cameron does a nice job at the start of fooling us all into thinking Ah-nold is the bad guy once again.The film flows nicely and again there are few moments to rest in this film.The only moments of such that come to mind are their trek to Mexico,where they regroup before the movies finale.Other than that it is go,go,go.Patrick's character brings the threat level a notch higher than even the first movie.His model of terminator is that much better than Ah-nolds and his liquid metal composition makes for an almost indestructible opponent.The Sarah character hasbecome that much stronger emotionally and physically,as she has prepared both herself and her son for the inevitable battle ahead.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and in this extreme edition,is clear and crisp.This two disc single sided collection has disc one offering up the 152 minute extreme version and it's a great version at that.The outer dust jacket that can be slid off,tells you that these DVDs contain\\"multiple\\"versions;as in more than just two,but two are all you get.And to get the original theatrical version,which is on disc two,you have to play it in your computer and have a system with Win/XP and lower to run it,with an internet connection.Extras on the first disc have commentary and the film is THX optimized.The second disc has,along with the other film version,a couple of featurettes and some other computer spawned specials.<br />All in all Cameron actually topped the first Terminator with this one.The S/FX were far and away that much better.The story just keeps rolling along as the trio of Ah-nold,Sarah and young John try to outrun the seemingly indestructible Patrick;who just never stops coming.4- 4 1/2 stars.become that much stronger emotionally and physically,as she has prepared both herself and her son for the inevitable battle ahead.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and in this extreme edition,is clear and crisp.This two disc single sided collection has disc one offering up the 152 minute extreme version and it's a great version at that.The outer dust jacket that can be slid off,tells you that these DVDs contain\\"multiple\\"versions;as in more than just two,but two are all you get.And to get the original theatrical version,which is on disc two,you have to play it in your computer and have a system with Win/XP and lower to run it,with an internet connection.Extras on the first disc have commentary and the film is THX optimized.The second disc has,along with the other film version,a couple of featurettes and some other computer spawned specials.<br />All in all Cameron actually topped the first Terminator with this one.The S/FX were far and away that much better.The story just keeps rolling along as the trio of Ah-nold,Sarah and young John try to outrun the seemingly indestructible Patrick;who just never stops coming.4- 4 1/2 stars.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gone Girl is a psychological study of a husband and wife, each writing from their own perspective (i.e. in the first person).  It turns out that what they write is not always quite what happened or what happened at all.  The mystery is more about what is real and what is staged than about who did what to whom.<br />I think it's brilliantly done.  A book you won't forget in a hurry!
B0054LRR3S|5.0|I was so excited when I found out I could get this CD in the U.S.  I love every song.  With all the bands that sound the same lately, SBTRKT is refreshing.  If you like great music, buy this CD.  You will not be disappointed.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have played every Angry Birds title to date and never have I had as much fun as I have with this one. The graphics are the best yet, the animatics are fun, and they stick to the story of Star Wars surprisingly closely. The only drawback that I found was that I had to pay extra for bonus levels (Path of the Jedi), but it was totally worth it. It's fun, it's challenging, and it's a great way to whittle away time on break/lunch at work or while sitting in the doctor's office waiting to be seen.<br /><br />The birds this time are pretty great too. I mean how can you go wrong with the Force, lightsaber wielding birds, and R2D2 shocking the crap out of Storm Trooper pigs? Not to mention big ol' Chewbacca bird. Han bird even fires his lasers. I thought the sound effects for each were a great touch, too. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a Star Wars fan, an Angry Birds fan, or some awesome combination of the two.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I hold all of Grisham's books up to what I consider his best book - The Firm.  Or A Time to Kill.<br /><br />This is good and a quick read - but it seems to be a hodge podge with key plot points taken from his other books, remixed and re-presented for your pleasure.  Like many other wonderful authors, Grisham seems to be grinding out books for publisher's needs or perhaps his own pursuit of money.  I'm looking for the NEXT great suspense/action/legal writer.  I probably won't read any more Grisham - nothing to surprise me any more.
0307477401|4.0|i don't know if it's genetic or cultural but people always seem to want to know how a story ends. it's been suggested that not getting what you want can be a blessing. apparently many feel that way about the most recent - and apparently final - installment of the successful wallender series. we do get *some* closure with the most important women in kurt's life, but those of you who like warm & fuzzy endings with every loose end wrapped up nice and neat will be gravely disappointed with how this novel (and the wallender story line) ends.<br /><br />however, i suspect that i use the term success for different reasons than most who will post reviews of \\"the troubled man\\"; i use the term to describe how mankell has been able to use the wallander series as a vehicle as a commentary on swedish society, he has referred to it as the swedish anxiety in a prologue in \\"the pyramid\\". that's not to say that mankell's commentary on society is limited to the wallander series: \\"the man from beijing\\" is (to me) a fairly obvious statement about colonialism. but i digress; apparently mankell feels that he's gotten as much mileage as he can out of this vehicle (pun intended) and mankell has no more to say about the swedish anxiety. personally i find that more lamentable than about the way in which mankell chose to end the series (which i didn't find a surprise considering mankell's political and philosophical leanings).

B003Y5H5BA|5.0|This movie is very loosely based on the original TV series 21 Jump Street from the 80's. The movie is about two cops that get a second chance by going undercover and stopping crime in schools. We got this movie thinking it would be okay. We soon found out it was so funny. I love the two characters - they played their parts well. Also Ice Cube was really funny as well. I'm old enough to have watched 21 jump street but I never did. I'm sure they have similarities in them but not the same. I wouldn't watch this movie expecting it to be like the show in from so long ago.<br /><br />Some people don't like Channing Tatum - I haven't seen him in much so I can't say for what he has done in other movies. He was great in this one. He was funny and played his part well. Jonah Hill was also great but he is good in all the movies I have seen in him.<br /><br />I have seen that they are coming out with a second 21 jump street (the end also eluded to that as well). I'm quite excited and can't wait to see it.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone. It really funny and you will definitely enjoy it.

0446580848|1.0|Having read all the one star reviews, all I can say is \\"ditto\\".  I've been a big DeMille fan.  Read everything he's written, but I'm done with him.  The Panther is tedious, repetitious, bloated, juvenile,shallow, and without a serious plot.  John Corey has become a macho egomaniacal adolescent jerk.  Another thing-- this book is incredibly jingoistic.  If you like the flag waving kill-them-all-let-God-sort-them-out kind of war mongering, then it probably won't bother you.  For me, it gets old after a while.  It's sad to see a once creative and articulate author turn out such a piece of drivel.
0316228532|4.0|In spite of reading negative reviews ahead of time, many people who attempt to read the Casual Vacancy are probably hoping that they will have an experience with it comparable to their enjoyment of the Harry Potter books. Where it was hard to put the Harry Potter books down because we liked the characters so much, it is hard to keep reading The Casual Vacancy because we like the characters so little. What was fascinating to me was just how different the two worlds are that Rowling has created. Harry Potter is about good vs. evil, friendship, loyalty, self-sacrifice,  and survival on a grand scale.  The Casual Vacancy is about the life of a small village of no particular importance filled with dysfunctional people who are destroyed.  Most of the characters are petty and self-absorbed, doing what they think they need to do to survive regardless of the havoc it causes for someone else. There is shocking meanness in the book. There is disturbing, raw vulgarity and exploitative sex. There is no love, and almost no charity. Yet, to my surprise, I cried at the end.  The Casual Vacancy is in many ways the antithesis of the Harry Potter books.  As such it shows Rowling to have quite a range as a writer. I didn't enjoy reading The Casual Vacancy the same way I enjoyed reading Harry Potter, but I'm glad I read it.  It was thought-provoking.  There are 3, maybe 4, women who are admirable in the book,who try to help others.  I think they will be what sticks with me, plus Rowling's point that it is easy to judge a person's actions but hard to understand them if you don't know their secrets or motives for acting.

B007K3JCAE|4.0|The producers of \\"A Game of Shadows\\" must think so, because Holmes has a problem worthy of James Bond -- preventing a world war (circa 1891). Holmes has become an action hero, whose skill at scientific fighting enables him to defeat any attacker. Even two. Hiding in the rafters.<br /><br />This is one of those rare sequels that's better -- much better (That's a joke. Get it?) -- than the original. The writing is sharper, there's a lot less of Rachael McAdams, and the story goes beyond being a clever mystery to examining (if only superficially) why humans engage in war. I particularly enjoyed Jared Harris as Moriarty, who doesn't drool and slobber like the stereotypical movie villain. The Bond/Grant train fight is reprised (though as such a bloated battle as to approach absurdity), and the auction scene from \\"North by Northwest\\" (sometimes considered a precursor of the Bond films) is winked at.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the four-star rating I gave the first film has to remain, simply because Holmes' character has been altered to near-unrecognizability. He's like the anthropomorphic Jiminy Cricket in \\"Pinocchio\\" -- he's a cricket because the other characters /say/ he is. Had Holmes remained as Conan Doyle created him, this film would have been a significant contribution to the Holmes tales. As it is, it is merely an entertaining confection.<br /><br />There are at least two anachronisms, one major, which I leave the viewer to discover. (No, it's not contact lenses, the first successful version of which dates to 1887. Nor is it plastic surgery, which is almost 3000 years old.)<br /><br />Those familiar with the Holmes canon will know how the film ends long before the final scene. There's room for another sequel, but I hope it isn't made, as it will be hard to equal this entry, let alone top it. (I checked, and someone is writing #3. One can only hope he comes up with something genuinely original.)

B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like this gal. She is funny and inspiring and I like most of the exercises, so that I can get my teenaged daughter to do them along with me.  The one thing I do not like or believe in is all of her Abs work.  I have always noticed (and this was no exception here) that doing crunches just pops out the fat over your ab muscles and makes you look thicker through the middle. So, unless you have very little body fat already, I cannot recommend the crunch parts.  I am average build 5'4&#34; and 115 lbs and exercise regularly, but still find this part not to work for lovely middles.  Other than that, I love that you can do a quite exhausting workout in only 20 minutes per day and in your home.  Now there really aren't too many reasons not to exercise.

B009P5S11G|1.0|Okay, I am a fifty-something guy, so Rihanna's music isn't exactly targeted to my demographic group. However, I am hip, gay, and I REALLY dig a lot of RiRi's songs. So even though I wasn't 100% gaga for the first single \\"Diamonds,\\" I liked it and the song \\"Stay\\" enough to run out and buy the whole CD today. Ugh. Ugly. Cacaphony. Noise. Repetition. Only one remotely danceable tune, \\"Nobody's Business.\\" But absolutely nothing close to the musical calibar of \\"Disturbia,\\" \\"Don't Stop the Music,\\" \\"S&M,\\" \\"We Found Love\\" or  \\"Only Girl in the World.\\" What's mostly wrong with \\"Unapologetic\\" is that the songs are all utterly self-absorbed and unconnected to the average human. I agree with another reviewer who said Rihanna needs to lay off the weed...at least when she's writing and recording. I had to bring it back for a refund/credit. No apology. It's that godawful.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved the narrator of this story.  He was a cleaver and witty guy. Grisham did a good job of developing this character as the story developed.<br />There was such suttle foreshadowing that it did not give away the conclusion, at least not to me.  I thought the climax of the story was hilarious!  If only we all could get rich like this!!!<br /><br />I happen to know someone who is in a federal prison.  Grisiham's description of the activities and living conditiions in such a prison seemed accurate to me. However, I'm sure it is not that easy to walk out of such an institution! (LOL)<br /><br />I found this book to be humorous, entertaining, excicitng and I certainly would recommend it anyone.

B007SGM084|5.0|When I was reading this book, I didn't expect that I'd like it as much as I do. I figured I'd like it just because of what it is notorious for, simple sex scenes and not a lot of dynamics. That's what I got from the first book, there was a lot of sex and the characters were not super original but WOW, the cliffhanger at the end of the first book sets up the second and third book. It's honestly very good but somewhat cliche at the same time. The situation and characters are certainly different but not entirely unique. It's just the way that they come together that makes it so amazing. I'd recommend it if you're into some cliches with a twist of originality. :).
0553386794|4.0|It has taken me three attempts, since 1996, to finish reading this book, but the delay isn't exactly George R.R. Martin's fault. The first two attempts were reading copies that belonged to other people, and I didn't have time to finish the book before I had to return it to its owner. After seeing previews of the HBO series, I purchased a copy and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the book, with one proviso, which I will mention at the end of this review.<br />The strength of this book, and of this series to date, is Mr. Martin's ability to write many different characters, each with a different voice; and his ability to write an interweaving narrative and keep track of a seemingly infinite number of intertwining story lines. The characters are all interesting. The heroes of the story are all seriously flawed, and, unlike most fantasy villains, the bad guys are three dimensional and don't see themselves as evil, and often are just as engaging and endearing as the heroes of the tale.  As a case in point, Eddard Stark is brave and loyal, but blind to the ambitions of others, seeing everybody else as being as noble and loyal as himself, which costs him his live. His wife is a rather vindictive shrew, when all is said and done, unwilling to accept the flaws of others. King Robert is a cad, there's no other way to put it. Sansa Stark is an addlepated idiot. Only her younger sister Arya, seems to have the brains that God gave a goose. These are the good guys. On the other side of the ledger, we have a pair of incestuous twins with murderous hearts, a scheming father, and a misshapen dwarf whose virtues pose him on the brink of going over to the good side. The rest of the cast is made up of various hangers-on and lick-spittles who often play both ends against the middle as events unfold.<br />Each chapter serves up a portion of a story, told from the point of view of one character, and all are so well written that I found myself interested in each chapter and wanting to see how their particular portion of the story fits into the whole. In a genre of fiction that is dominated by stories that are, at best, retreads on the Theme of Tolkien, George R. R. Martin's novel is refreshingly unique, and though it's a long book, it doesn't bog the reader down with things like Elven languages and thousands of years of prehistory worked into the text.<br />And this brings me to the one real flaw of this book. I read it in the mass market paperback edition, and I will have to admit that due to my aging eyes, the print in the paperback is just too darned small. It was difficult to read this book without wearing my bifocals. This book should really have been split into two paperbacks with larger print, rather than using such a small font in order to cram the story into one volume. My advice to readers is too look for a larger trade paperback version, or the hardback version. Even if you have 20-20 vision, you'll probably need glasses by the time you finish reading the tiny, tiny print in the mass market paperback edition.w their particular portion of the story fits into the whole.

B009AMANBA|5.0|\\"Can we choose to be born or are we fitted to the times we are born into?\\" The Civil War is coming to an end. President Abraham Lincoln (Lewis) is trying to get the 13th Amendment to the Constitution (abolishing slavery) passed before the end of the war. Not surprisingly he meets strong opposition. Before I start as most of you know I am a huge history buff and was really looking forward to seeing this so I had high expectations. I have to admit it did not let me down at all and may have actually been better then I was hoping for. Lewis was amazing in this (as usual) and this may be his best performance so far, which is saying a lot. Im my opinion Spielberg has yet to make a bad movie and the streak does not end with this one. Best movie of the year and best performance I have seen so far. I very highly recommend this movie. Not just history fans will like this but movie fans in general. Overall, a great movie that in my opinion is a must see not only for the subject but for Lewis's performance. I give it an A+.

I will start by saying that I did like the other two movies but was never a huge fan of the series. When I first heard about this third movie my first though was...why...doesn't seem like a new one is needed. After watching this I have to say that this may be my favorite in the series. While the others were OK this one seemed to have a real plot and felt more grown up then the others. There is still quite a bit of comedy and kids will still enjoy this but the overall feel was more adult based and I think that really helped me enjoy this one more. Overall, this is still a good family comedy but will appeal to adults more then the other two did at least I did. I give it a B+.

At first, I wasn't sure about the shifting time periods (there are three main ones) in the book, but she handles all the shifts with aplomb and I found I just had to find out what happens next. The premise of the book is a mystery: how did a four year old girl wind up alone on the docks in Queensland, Australia in 1913? The whole of the book is devoted to solving this puzzle and along the way you meet some fascinating characters. I especially loved Eliza and found her story very moving. I have read &#34;the House at Riverton&#34; and am now reading &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; both by the same author. They all start out with a mystery to be solved and I enjoyed (am enjoying) them both, but &#34; The Forgotten Garden&#34; is my favorite. I highly recommend this book.

B003TNQEF0|5.0|I love this flick. If you're reading reviews, please ignore the half-wits that not only trashed the movie, but also gave away the twist at the end. The Mist is pretty intense, definitely one of the better Stephen Kind adaptations.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I'm a mystery fan and Lee Child is my favorite these days.  Jack Reacher is a big, smart, tough, wandering protagonist with no home and no baggage -- his prize possession is his folding toothbrush.<br /><br />This book is not quite as hard-driving as 61 Hours, but it doesn't diappoint Reacher fans.  Almost in &#34;real time&#34;, the story loops around nicely from the first page to the last.  Well worth reading -- and if you're new to Jack Reacher, go read 61 Hours!
B009VB7P6G|3.0|Sacherine and annoying just what every little girl loves. My 13 y/o daughter is a fan still and was glued to it, as an adult I found it difficult to stomach but then it was not made for me was it? if your kid is a fan thay will love it.

B00992CF6W|4.0|It has no flaws. It just needs things like monsters and animals and caves. I played this on my kindle fire and you can build, but I played a demo on my aneroid htc cellphone, and the last complain is it just stops you when you get to the edge or kills you if you dig to deep. So my Ideas to fix that are, make the earth round, and go into something like hell, or the nether when you get to deep and fall and die.

B0059XTV4Y|5.0|One receives according to the mode of the receiver, and, that being said, please allow me to attempt to interpret Madonna's interpretation. For starters, being that I am frequently scandalized by Madonna's crazy behavior, and moreover, well aware of her past failures in the movie industry I chose to ignore this film for the longest time, and, boy was I ever mistaken in doing so. In this film \\"W.E.\\" Madonna has produced a most profound work of art in the manner in which she employed many various devices of communication in which to portray one of the most touching love affairs (emotionally speaking) involving incredible paramount sacrifice. Further, she effectively endeavors to excite insight into Wallace's feelings in regards to what she had to sacrifice as well. How does Madonna bring this off? She creates and utilizes a fictional character and story line in both communion and juxtaposition with the true story in order to let us see the true story through the eyes of the fictional character who seems to endure and be subject to similar plights and/or problems. That is to say, it is though the eyes, emotions and feelings of sadness and despondency of the fictional character that we see the actual true story of Wallace and Edward. Now granted, it is probably presumed that the viewer (for the most part) is familiar with the events of the past concerning Wallace and Edward (though there is enough substance provided in the film to articulate the story for those who may be unfamiliar with the events) and, therefore, sufficient time may be given to the development of the fictional character and her story. After about 40 minutes or so into this film I just could not stop saying: WOW!, WOW!, WOW!, WOW!...the entire time. This film is so well done! I absolutely loved it! Beautiful music score as well. The only caveat is that the film is rated R for two scenes of graphic domestic violence (and a total of five f-words in the two scenes). There are no sex scenes (though it starts to appear like one may happen but does not). Anyway, these two scenes can be quickly fast forwarded through (they are only a few seconds each). So, let me conclude by saying that I not only love this movie, but, I totally get it! I suspect many do not, however, and that is why it did not do very well. Please do not be deceived by the poor reviews from the critics for this film is a true masterpiece! A profound masterpiece! I give it 5 gigantic stars!!!!ts to appear like one may happen but does not). Anyway, these two scenes can be quickly fast forwarded through (they are only a few seconds each).

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a free app to play bingo with many others. It's a lot of fun as long as you win once in a while but never-the-less it is a cute bingo game.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I downloaded this app while looking for something fun to do to pass the time, and it generated a fake review on Amazon in my name saying it was addictive and amazing.  In truth, it is a forgettable, poorly written app that is presumably receiving incredible reviews by having the development team write them on their own by giving themselves permission via the app's settings.  Shame on Big Duck Games LLC!

B002VQ7PVS|5.0|I actually give this close to 5 stars, maybe more like 4.5. It's a wonderful story with marvelous locales, dialogue, plot twists and so on. I was milady annoyed by the alternation of chapters between the mother and daughter's lives but that was essential for the story, and I wasn't quite so enthralled with the daughter's life and times, but I still give it a ver, very high rating as very well written and extremely enjoyable
B007N579X6|5.0|I'm a big time animation fan.  Loved this movie from the first.  Got it in 3D for my new projector.  It's also region free which is kind of nice since there are no promos or much of anything else, at least on the 3D part.  Works fine on my Blu ray player.
B0031RS8NK|4.0|A good holiday read.  This author follows a similar framework in each of her books, but fleshes out each one with very different settings.  This one was fun.  I paticularly liked how the 1920s fashion, style and vernacular was woven into the story.

B009NOVCTM|3.0|Sorry there will be no buy from me this time around. The Bigger Bang was the Stones last very good album. I have all these songs already with the same sound quality. The Forty licks cd has a good line up on it. Plus all the other greatist hit records, cds and downloads. All these older artists are reselling the same recording over with the remastered selling point. I guess the die hard fan will buy it again. There is only two new songs on this hits again package, just download the new ones.  What a bad album cover for this cd. This should of had a classier cover with the band on it or something better than the same old logo on an ape. One of the good things here is you can get it on vinyl but it will cost you. Nice to have clear, new sounding vinyl again. I will enjoy what I all ready have in my collection. I hate to see it end also, their music is been such a part of our lives.
0307730697|5.0|What a great book.  It was recommended by a friend and I enjoyed it tremendously.  Adam Brown, although started out with troubles, showed that if you put your mind to it anything can be accomplished.
B00846TRHY|3.0|bought this movie because it was based on a true story and that can make a slow movie worth watching if you like that type movie .
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book carries the entertainment equivalent of its weight in gold.  Consider me a fan.  It's epic in scope, yet personal in its storytelling.  It has a new world, but is easy to relate to.  I found the book cleanly written and easy to read.  Its beginning is heart wrenching and the ending is triumphant.  What's not to love.  The only thing I don't like about this book is that the sequel isn't already out!
B009VB97EY|5.0|i had my doubts because I know that most male strippers on average are gay (not that there is anything wrong with being gay). what I am saying is, as a heterosexual woman, if I am going to shove $ down some guys g-string, I want them to be into me at the very least. This movie was good, I'd watch it again for sure.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|So... Sometimes I think John Scalzi just stopped trying after he finished his Old Man's War series.  I mean don't get me wrong, this book is good and worth reading.  Just maybe not before you read some other books that are better deserving of your time.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|It has never happened that any artist has devoted a considerable part of an album tracklist to my favourite songs. That scenario would be most unlikely. Therefore it was totally beyond the realms of possibility that an album by my very favourite singer would be composed almost entirely of songs that I love.  But that is what has just happened with Susan Boyle's new album, Standing Ovation.<br /><br />When I first listened to these eleven songs one after the other, I was reduced to tears by the emotion, the beauty, the artistry of Susan's gorgeous voice and the originality of her interpretations. I would be willing to bet that no other artist (outside of perhaps the classical genre) has ever done something like this - released an album full of the most beautiful and perfect tracks, so that one cannot help but love every single one of them.<br /><br />The first track, \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\", is startling in its difference.  It is like a new song.  In Susan's plaintive and beautiful voice the lyrics have real, deep meaning and she transports the listener with her to the land where dreams come true.  In \\"Bring Him Home\\", her voice begins acapella and then the orchestra comes in to lend dramatic support for the remainder of the song. This is heartrendingly beautiful, sung with such intensity by this perfect female voice. Another of my all-time favourite songs is \\"All I Ask of You\\", but never before have I been so moved by it. Donny and Susan's two voices are perfect together.  And Susan's is so exquisitely tender and appealing.<br /><br />Susan uses her amazing voice in so many different ways, to convey so many life experiences and so many human emotions from classics spanning the years, that the common theme of musical theatre could never be seen as restricting her versatility in any way. And I find it amazing that though the songs and the emotions and the styles are so diverse, they fit together so that when played one after the other there is no jarring note, but instead a harmonious and balanced pattern of sound, like a bouquet of beautiful flowers.<br /><br />I hope that all her future albums will likewise be themed ones.
B001R6G34I|5.0|This was great. The sound was really good, better than what I thought it would be and the picture quality was excellent.
B009329Y30|4.0|i have always enjoyed a good love story. when you guys need to sit back and watch a chick flix with your wife  this will be a good one .
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I got this book because it was rated and plastered all over bookstores and the internet.  It's a mainstream novel that I'm sure would appeal to, well, the mainstream crowd that doesn't quite have anything to do with the concepts therein.  However, it was still fun to read.  As a more geeky person, I was just annoyed over and over by how he got everything almost right.  Maybe I'm too picky.  Others might rate it 4 stars, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to give this 5.  I read this on a six hour plane flight and it passed the time for me admirably.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Once again another rock star that shows amazing courage to put it all out there. Great book, written very well. Thanks for giving me a glimpse of your world.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|The movie had a lot of twists and turns, however, the overall storyline was pretty predictable.  I did not expect the cursing and explicit language and think it would have been a better movie without it.

B008TMA1LY|3.0|Game is too hard for little kids without spending a fortune for points.  Each level should give free points to be able to get more helpers.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Gees just get a whole lot of stand in writers and put in a very very poor effort , Honestly theres about 3 great songs 3 avg songs and the rest are just poor contrived crap . Tylor sounds good , but the rest seem like their phoning it in ,  This isnt a true ROCK  album , have they any idea anymore , Listen to the new VAN HALEN album , true classic ROCK . Pass this one
B008IJTFYW|4.0|great free app! I love that I can create my own melody with all the different sound options. my favorite is flute, river, thunder and wind chimes!  The sounds sound organic,  not electronic and I haven't experienced any obvious looping as I have in other apps similar.<br /> The only thing I ddon't like is that on my kindle it wont play in the background if I want to read a book for example and listen at the same time.  not sure if this is a function of the kindle or the app but overall a great app!
0307346617|3.0|I bought this book because I wanted a different twist on zombie stories. I actually dislike any zombie story but thought this would be an exception. Which also is and quite interesting as well.<br /><br />However, what I found strange was the author's lack of character creativity. All of them seem to be the same, which at times got me confused. I would go back and forth to check if the one being interviewed was the same as the last one; or was the author only interviewing one person. Whether the character was from China, Israel, Brazil, Africa and so on... they are all alike. They all sound American. All are the same. Even their sarcasms and wit are the same. And this is what makes it disappointing. I like character creativity and this book definitely has none.<br /><br />Also, I felt that the story was about the author's way of venting out his frustration on the US political situation which to me is very annoying. Its like \\"hey, read between the lines, its not only a zombie story\\".<br /><br />But I'd still recommend this book if you don't mind the criticism I just mentioned.  Buy it or wait for the movie so you are assured that the characters come alive. It would be nice to hear a Chinese man speak English with a Chinese accent.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An EXCELLENT book !! It's well written. And discloses no &#34;National Secrets&#34; beyond the fact that the people in Washington are IDIOTS....!!  And.... If you glean that from this book, you must be Retired Military.....!<br /><br />I think Mark Owen did an excellent job of spelling out a typical &#34;Special Ops&#34; mission. I've read the book twice. The first read<br />spelled out the mission and how it was accomplished.  The second read was post media blitz after the Pentagon accused the author of spilling military secrets.  As retired military, myself, I saw nothing in the book that could be considered &#34;classified<br />information.&#34;  At the very worst: Mark Owen showed us how the &#34;Military Brass&#34; jockey for photo ops and seize every opportunity to claim GLORY even when GLORY is not their's to be had. Political posturing is the biggest &#34;chink&#34; in America's armor.  So.... If you're looking for &#34;military secrets&#34; your purpose might be better served watching a James Bond film.
B0092C2X7U|3.0|I'm going mad trying to get past level one! I love free play but I just cant play finish level one. :( Way too expensive. Don't pay until you test out the demo. I got it as faotd.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|As retired military, myself, I found Lone Survivor to be an extremely accurate account of a &#34;Special-Ops&#34; mission. Lone Survivor will be very interesting to every reader regardless of one's knowledge of the military.  You will find Lone Survivor an easy read that's hard to put down. Enjoy..!!

B005GG0MIS|5.0|Fascinating story about a subject I knew very little about.  Nixon comes off as probably the most interesting of the group.  I'm still not a Nixon fan but he has risen far above where he was before. How expresidents become friends with each other was wonderful fun.  I did not know that much about Hoover so I was impressed with the work he did following WWII. And his friendship with Truman was also new information.

B009LK6JS2|1.0|First of all I am very impressed with the little I could play on this game - the graphics are nice & it feels quite real.  I did fine until I got to the flight tutorial & my screen orientation kept on flipping & flying me into the ground.  I have a Kindle Fire HD.  I got this on a FAOTD so I am not grumbling too much.  If they fix this problem, I will buy this one - it looks really fun!!!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|NOT HIS BEST EFFORT. TAKES A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP HIS STORY AND REVISITS THE PAST TOO OFTEN. IT DOES PAINT A REALISTIC PICTURE OF YEMEN.
0061537969|5.0|Who would have thought I would have enjoyed a book narrated by a dog? How about a book with an underlined theme related to car racing?  Not me, on either account. But I was wrong. This book is amazing. Well written. Thought provoking. Intense.<br /><br />It's been a while since I've felt so strongly about a book in the general fiction genre. This book is approachable and easy to read for all.  It's not one of those \\"literary fiction\\" book where if feels like your sitting in a college Lit course.  You don't even have to be into racing to enjoy this book. The themes in the book apply to basically everyone.  I was able to draw on several things that Enzo said that were pretty enlightening, especially for a \\"dog\\".  In my personal opinion, this book talks about a lot of life lessons that we all need to remember at one time or another.  It will make you think about what's important in life and focus on that.  We all need to be brought back to that sometimes in a world where what's really important seems to get lost.<br /><br />As the story went on, I really became invested in the lives of Enzo, Denny and Zoe.  I wanted them to have the happy ending even when they all were being dragged through hell and back.  I've never rooted so hard for a happy ending in my life. I usually like a realistic one, but after all these characters have been through, I want a happy one with rainbows and candy.  I didn't get quite that, but pretty close.  The end was awesome. Warning: Pet lovers will probably shed a tear or two.  Even if you're not a pet lover, you'll be tearing up too or at the very least, you'll get that big lump in your throat that you get when you're trying not to cry.<br /><br />I listened to this on audio, so I can't end the review without discussing the narrator. The audio was performed by Christopher Welch. This guy rocks. I loved his voice and how he was able to make Enzo come to life.  He was able to project the emotions of the characters and I felt like I was really connecting with everyone in the story.connecting with everyone in the story.

One day I was reading my cousin's FB status and it read, \\"My seven year old Natalie said that a mistake can become a masterpiece ...she learned that in art class...her own thoughts on this was that sometimes you can make something that you don't like but everybody else loves it and that's because you tried your best ...out of the mouths of babes comes wisdom.\\" I immediately ordered this book for her.<br /><br />Have courage, dream, believe, inspire.

0812993292|5.0|This novel reveals the terrible impact of silence upon a couple after tragedy occurs. Silent grief feeds blame & resentment which destroys any ability to communicate. When hard things remain unspoken between people then the distance grows exponentially.<br /><br />One of the beautiful parts of this book is that it is about an ordinary man who decides to listen to himself & do something unusual for a friend dying of cancer. The story of his mistakes, success & determined choices is about his process along the way & how he changes and affects changes in others.<br /><br />He has tremendous resolve and he is terribly discouraged as anyone is who does something courageous. He decides to walk over 500 miles to his friend. It's the truth of this journey that captures the reader;  from the band aids (plasters) & sore feet including his denial that she'll recover because of his pilgrimage.<br /><br />As Harold walks he reflects a lot on his life. The actual tragedy is not revealed until the end. The way their silence piles up in impossible layers is the second tragedy that still might be repaired......or not, which is true of so many couples. It is powerful to read about the wife's struggle to think kinder thoughts, and not be able to squeak the words out because of her habit of anger.<br /><br />The purpose of anger is to create distance and says \\"I'm important.\\" It can be a very useful tool. Harold's wife demonstrates that a habit of anger is an entirely different story and leads to the lonely path of bitterness. I often caution those who start down this path because it is such an awful choice for the soul. Bitterness becomes a comforting prison that's hard to leave.<br /><br />Harold makes the mistakes of those who are kind to a fault. I found myself wincing and wishing he was more self protective, but that's the point; he has to find his way despite his strengths & weaknesses (just like we all do).<br /><br />Silence has the power of erosion on a relationship. It seems so impossible to say what's real about who we are and what we feel on our insides. It is a tragedy when two people grow apart without the words that can create an understanding.<br /><br />Tragedy has this effect on people. This includes our recent experience with Hurricane Sandy on the east coast. It really matters that families take time to ask each other: \\"What was the hardest part for you?\\" Don't let the silence of grief keep you encapsulated in your aloneness. Struggle to share the words that are trapped inside.<br /><br />My favorite literary award is the Man Booker out of England & this novel made the long list of 12, though not the final list of 6. This is a first novel for the author & actress Rachel Joyce.so impossible to say what's real about who we are and what we feel on our insides.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is one that you shouldn't miss.  We passed this around bridge club and everyone loved it.  It is a deeply moving reminder of a sad time in history.
B00338QENI|5.0|So interesting.  I enjoyed the description of this time period.  The book presents so much to think about.  Genetics is such an interesting topic.

0763650447|5.0|There are many colors and counting and a nice rhyme to this book.  My 2 year old granddaughter cannot have this read to her too often.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Good stuff,good to seeit on Kindle and wish to have also pdf creater soon. Wish to see more such productive apps for Kindle.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I haven´t completed my book yet, but I followed the instructions here, and so far it has been quite easy.  The ease of publishing the book has made me excited to finish it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|He loved this book.  The history and nostalgia of the story were right up his alley.<br />I am currently reading it at his insistance and find the length to be a bit overwhelming in detail.<br />Not a scary book, like other Stephen King stories.
B004S2BXCA|5.0|What more can be said about this book. It's a classic for sure.  The tricks and routines are still relevant.  And i picked up the digital copy  so i could pleasure read on my iPad and phone.... you can't sit at the cool table if you don't have this book.
B000002IAZ|5.0|I have the vinyl.....wanted the CD.  Doesn,t sound exactly the same on CD, but they never do.  It is more portable
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I am a huge fan of the early books. Word of honor my all time favorite followed by Charm school. This book is a good timely read and does the subject matter justice. I did enjoy it.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|As a reader of paranormal romances, I think this is one of the better stories I have read.  I thoroughly enjoyed the different take on paranormal beings, and the story left me eager for the next book in the series.  I definitely recommend this book to those who enjoy paranormal fiction.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|While not one of Pixar's finest films (Up, WALL-E, Toy Story), Brave is a hilarious, rousing, visually stunning, well-acted, beautifully crafted, excellent film for the whole family!<br />Four Brilliant Stars!
B0000067L2|4.0|This CD arrived promptly and in good shape.  I was a little disappointed in the music as it contained many songs I wasn't familiar with, but that's my fault and not the company who sent it to me.  They did a good job.
B009VB97EY|4.0|This movie was kept fresh by the performances and direction of a tale told so often I can't count.  The poignant difference here is the learning from a male point of view what it is like to be treated as an object.  It is a combination of the dreams of Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever, with beefcake the means to an end.  Put in a dash of Don Cheadle's role in Boogy Nights, and we feel for a chararacter who has come to a point where decisions have to made.  Soderbergh keeps it moving.  Tatum is a star.
B000001FDI|5.0|The music is wonderful and the CD quality is great.  The case came broken and falls apart every time I open it, but I guess that seems to be the main problem of buying used and is not unexpected as I find this problem often buying used.  The music is great and that's what counts.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone trying to understand photography. I  have also watch many of his YouTube instructional videos. They are straight forward and easy to understand just as his book is. HIGHLY recommend this book along with &#34;Tony Northrup's DSLR Book: How to Create Stunning Digital Photography&#34;. I've learned so much in so little time from Bryan Peterson, Tony Northrup and Mark Wallace (AdoramaTV on YouTube).
B008XG1X18|5.0|this site is beyond amazing, anything you could want, need or dream up is on here with pictures.  Keep Posting!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was ready to be disappointed. I was ready to dis Plant's voice, Jimmy's playing, and to wonder why they asked Bonham's son to fill such unfillable shoes...<br /><br />But...boy, were my expectations wrong! Thankfully!<br /><br />This is the most incredible Led Zeppelin DVD that I've ever seen of them live. Of course, I'm not naive enough to think they didn't edit some parts, but, it still is an INCREDIBLE testimony and statement for what STILL REMAINS the best and most influential rock and roll band of our generation. EVERY selection is a \\"tour de force\\" of aggression and heaviness. It is a miracle that they insisted on only 4 players---ONLY FOUR!---to fill out each and every part, when they could've made it \\"cool\\" to have hired players. Instead, they rely on JPJ to really fill out the bass, whether on keys or on pedal bass, or string bass. They keep it \\"real\\", and alive and just fantastic.<br /><br />The world suffers to not be able to see this live, again and again, but...then again, this is a time marker, a \\"time capsule\\"---only if they get together (WITH JPJ and Jason) and write more songs would it make sense to continue on as THIS group.<br /><br />Don't miss this. It isn't a contrived piece of record company crap---it is fantastic, heart felt, and blood and sweat and tears. It is organically conceived, and will serve as the best statement of what Led Zeppelin is and was in video...<br /><br />If only John were there could it be any better...and that's the best compliment I can possibly give.<br /><br />And Robert...whatever your beef with JPJ...GET OVER IT! PLEASE??? The World needs you guys working together again!
1469984202|5.0|A great read.  Interesting look at the future and a way of life that I hope never happens. Author paints a great picture.  Thanks!!!
0375869026|4.0|Wow - my wife and our 10-year-old daughter read this first and left it for me. I had a very hard time starting it and struggled through the first few chapters - I'm not so good with sad stories and cruel people. But once the viewpoint shifts to the other characters I found the book incredibly uplifting and gave me faith that youth and even adults can do the right thing to those with disabilities and birth defects. Having experienced the latter with my (now 15-year-old) daughter, it is good to see.<br /><br />Read this book - grit your teeth through the first few chapters.. It will be worth it.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This movie was good however I have read the comic and because of that I was always comparing it to the comic and therefore this movie fell a bit short of my expectation, the comic was freaking amazing and the movie even though being good in it own right, doesn't come close to having the psychological effect on its audience like the comic does. But once again, a good movie never the less.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Good reading, well written and even though the story was a little farfetched and confusiing at times, I enjoyed the story and the way it was written.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is awesome :). I'm a huge brony and I love this app. it is FABULOUS. I got to meet Pinky Pie and Rainbow Dash and I Loved it!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Certainly was good reading. I enjoy a book that I can disappear into and yet feel upbuilt.  The characters were funny and sad and the plot while a little thin was compelling. Thanks to Jonaas Jonasson for this interesting escape.
B002SM2QDC|3.0|the film skipped constantly,I will give the product another try but this is not en easy way to watch a movie.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|Firstly ,<br /><br />Unlike almost all the other reviewers I like the vocals. One thing that I personally tire of is the macho grunting and growling lead singer thumping his chest on top of a throbbing metal band... to me its overkill and nothing of the brilliant light and shadow that I enjoy. This singer isn't competing with the band and it allows me to enjoy the music without being screamed at!!<br /><br />The CDs enhanced feature is a couple of variables in downloading to (in my case) iTunes.... a higher quality download and another version with 2dBs louder.  This is a very cool and interesting option that will become far more standard soon...<br /><br />Bravo to Steve Harris for not duplicating Maiden with another Bruce belting away... again its a matter of taste but I wanted to vote yes.
B008G59IKO|1.0|This bands first release was decent but they have managed to suck more and mroe with every release.  In this case Dos sucks twice as much as Uno....tres will sucks three times and much and uno simply sucks.
B009KKLQVS|5.0|Do I wish I'd seen this concert? Yes. Do I wish there was twice the material here?  Yes. For the lousy 15 bucks I spent today at Best Buy am I happy with this hour plus show on blu ray ?  Hell Yes!<br /><br />I can't argue with anybody who wants all the rest of the show and it seems like the last documentary DVD/BR and this could have easily been combined onto one DVD or BR but  for the price of a few gallons of gas I have a couple wonderful BR's from the 50th reunion and I'm thrilled!  Now if this BR disc wasn't 15 bucks but 30 and the DVD 25 instead of 10 ...I'd be screaming bloody murder like the other reviewers..<br /><br />I'm really glad I took the chance today and bought this.... we've watched it twice already and its a very valuable addition to my collection.<br /><br />Its filmed well.. the boys look like they are having fun and as I said it will enjoy heavy rotation forever.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Great comeback album.  Great set of songs and well performed.  I happy to be a Chris Cornell/Soundgarden fan again.  \m/\m/
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Fun movie for some mindless entertainment.  Lots of action and some funny, snarky dialogue at times.  Not knowing the backstory on all of the heroes, I'm sure I missed some references in the movie.  Jam packed battle at the end!  Loki (spelling?) was a great villain.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|I love Aerosmith and I always have but this album lies somewhere in the middle.  There are awesome songs on this album that will rock your a** off, but then there are some head scratchers which sound like a Steven tyler/joe perry solo album and a bit of filler that kind of takes away from it as a whole.  If they trimmed the fat and the stomach churning carrie underwood duet from this album it would have been another solid Aerosmith release.  Im happy I bought the album for the solid, straight up rock songs the band is famous for, but the filler ballads, and carrie underwood duet are like warts that are not needed on an otherwise great release.  Over all im happy with this album as I unchecked the underwood duet POS and a handful of filler ballads as I ripped it to my Ipod.  So for me, for this album to be ROCK solid it has about 9 tracks not 18.  9 good songs, 8 crap/filler songs and 1 grotesque turd with carrie underwood.<br /><br />Aerosmith - Music From Another Demension:<br /><br />Great!<br /><br />1. LUV XXX<br />2. Oh Yeah<br />5. Out Go The Lights<br />6. Legendary Child<br />8. Street Jesus<br />10. Lover Alot<br />13. Closer<br />11. We All Fall Down<br />12. Freedom Fighter<br /><br />Crap/filler:<br />3. Beautiful - Meh<br />4. Tell Me  - Meh<br />7. What Could Have Been Love  - toilet flush<br />9. Can't Stop Loving You  - toilet flush that flows over on your floor....<br />11. We All Fall Down  - meh<br />14. Something  - meh<br />15. Another Last Goodbye - meh<br />17. Oasis  - meh<br />18. Sunny Side of Love  - meh
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The story lines in this series were great. I feel as if it may enlighten some people that not all Muslims are terrorists and Americans ARE a very viable source of terrorist groups to use for their goals. It also gives insight into why some people may want to destroy the US, yet also gives you the inner turmoil that they may suffer. Claire Danes' role was incredible. She's smart, dedicated (maybe to an obsessive degree), and is usually right about her gut feelings. The struggles she faces with hiding her psychiatric condition shows her humanity and is such an accurate storyline concerning her being able to remain in the CIA. I recommend this to anyone who likes a fast paced drama with some very believable situations. This show just may open the public's minds to the dangers we still face as a nation.
B008C1O8CA|1.0|Another worthless tween punk, greasefest....avoid like the plague.  Uno sucks, dos twice as bad and tres three times as much, how could someone release three albums in one year and all of them be so horrid.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|A lot of fun, but it gets hard quickly. Not bad if you like a challenge. Definitely worth checking out.
B004LQJPEG|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out. It was fantastic then and it is still fantastic now. Well worth having for ones own DVD collection. Patel
B008UFUOH6|5.0|If you are interested in the music of Tracey Thorn, then I am preaching to the choir. She has an instantly recognizable voice not unlike that of Karen Carpenter's. Both share an evocative mood which conjures up a certain sadness which suits their material so well. Some of the tracks involve her longtime partner Ben Watt and reminds me of some of EBTG's finest works, notably \\"Idlewild\\" which remains my favorite album by the group. The closest example is \\"Hard Candy Christmas\\" which I had never remember hearing but my wife reminded me that the song is from the musical \\"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\\". This album is not a typical XMAS album and if you want that, then there are plenty of artists who have done the traditional Holiday album thing.<br />What you have here is a peerless vocalist with a fine choice of disparate songs arranged expertly with long term collaborators bringing back the early EBTG sound. If you liked Sarah McLachlan's XMAS album, \\"Wintersong\\" from a few years ago, then you know what kind of mood this album evokes. In short, you won't be disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|All in all, this is a great show. The show's pretty gory, and can be scary at times. However, it is very well written. I highly recommend this series.
B007P7UF06|3.0|In most of the beginning of this reproduction the lip sinc was off. This was a disappoinment because it took away from the songs and speaking.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I think whoever did this movie just used all the Alien movies. I hardly saw anything original and was extremely disappointed. I thought for sure this was going to be the sci fi movie of the year, but not even close. Anyone who has watched the Alien movies will see a much too close resemblance to scenes from those movies. If you watch it,  don't expect anything except a let down.  I have now, after a some years, watched it 3 times.  I still feel the same, and have more input, which is that even the android has about the same personality as the alien movies.  I really didn't see, after several watchings, anything truly original.  I did like Charlize Theron as a bad person, but her being in the movie was minor.  It had great special effects.  It was also a movie intended to to be 'the beginning' of the Alien movies.  That said, if you saw all the Alien movies, you won't be surprised that there is nothing new in this movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book had me hooked from page one.  I love the story about love and the passion that this book had from page one.  I immediately bought the next book and thought the storyline was better than 50 shades.
B004TI5N38|5.0|One of those that is hard to put down and go to sleep!!! Love the ending too. Just bought the sequel and hope he continues this series for some time to come.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I had previously read 50 shades and this book is a better read with a great story line.  I loved both of the characters and could not put this book down.  I am eagerly awaiting the next book.
0525953728|5.0|This book gives you a look into some of the experiences one individual had while serving our country as a member of DEVGRU.  This man was essentially in the right place at the right time to be part of the raid that took out Bin Laden, as he explains in the book.<br /><br />This book is well written, and at times entertaining with some humor.  The job these brave men do day in and day out is a dangerous one, but it's still a job to them, and like everyone else on the job, when the serious task at hand is completed the bust each others chops, which lightens the mood of the book a bit.<br /><br />For anyone who is interested in the military, or likes watching the specials on History Channel, National Geographic, or the old ones that Discovery use to run back in the 90s, I highly recommend this book.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This story is about the power of love even if it is against what society deems love should be.  They faced many struggles in the beginning of their relationship and had to work hard to stay apart.  I loved this story!!
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really like Kate Morton's books and her writing style. The book kept you guessing and it was easy to relate to the characters. Plus, I love to read anything that has to do with the World War II era. It's a beautiful read, and I highly recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Absolutley LOVED the story...although I did find many typos and mismatched words. Can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out in the spring!!!
B008M34CSI|3.0|The movie is OK at the best. Its play is primitive. Next day I forgot what this movie was about.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My Stepson and I really enjoy this game, it teaches, American history, economics, money management and most of all patiance. The only problem we find is; when we buy fences to make corrals, it gets very hard to place them where we want. Also a good update would be to make the animals move and walk all over. Over all we give this game from 1 to 100 a 90% approved positive feedback. Thank you !
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Can't have a Swayze collection without Dirty Dancing.  I don't like Jennifer Grey as much, but Swayze makes up for it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I've read and enjoyed all the HP series books.  I read them after seeing this movie.  The movie was very magical and enchanting that I decided to read the young adult book at my age of 24.  I'm now 36 years old and am currently reading the eBooks.<br />I've seen all the movies on the big screen.  And the last few became a required family viewing (Mom, cousins, Aunt, etc).<br />After countless waiting and 7 movies, I was pleased with the movie series.  I saw Deathly Hallows Part 2 at my local theaters Thursday opening night at midnight (2nd lifetime movie I saw for opening midnight showing).  The movies are brilliant.  As a Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed watching these movies countless times.<br /><br />Harry Potter is a very charming orphaned boy who finds out he can do magic.  He then goes to this amazing school called Hogwarts.  A school even I wish I could attend to.  Harry Potter bless you.<br /><br />The actors have matured throughout this series.  They've developed their skills and really perform well for their audience.  Daniel, Emma and Rupert have really done well.<br /><br />The product DVD is quite good.  I've got the cardboard cover 2 disc edition.  I recommend both product and the movie series.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I have this on the iPad and was really excited when I saw it for the Kindle. This is a great and easy way to stay up-to-date with news, lifestyle, blogs, and instagram.<br />I highly recommend this app!
B000028U0Y|5.0|The album and the whole story around it was very appealing to me. It proves what an outstanding performer he was on this live album. I also like the documentary on this that had recently aired on cable TV. Get It!
0307593312|5.0|This was the first Murakami book I read and it was a good one.  A page turner, showing multiple plot lines and developing them into a good story.  Makes you think as you read, worth re reading for sure.
B008D28HYS|5.0|A nice brain teaser with a twist.  Would be good for those who need to improve their logic skills but hate math and physics style logic games.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|Outstanding play,  Helen Mirren is great as Prospero, I love this production and interpretation of the Tempest, well worth watching, multiple times.
B00992CF6W|3.0|come on no 0.5.0 yet its been like a week come on we are all waiting for it how long does it take it been out for android and iphone but no kindle fire.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Obviously an awesome show. I adore it. Amazon let me download it quickly and hassle free but the quality isn't the greatest. It isn't bad though.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|There are the albums that get listened to once or twice, maybe ripped to the player storage, and then sort of disappear. There are the albums that get \\"put into the rotation\\" and get played a couple of times (maybe) a month.<br /><br />Then there are albums like this one. Ones that you listen to, and find yourself coming back from a dazed \\"OMG--what was THAT!?\\" state. And you turn up the volume another notch, and listen to it again.<br /><br />What's that you say? \\"Hey, I've listened to Mother Earth, and this doesn't sound like what I heard there.\\" Damn right it doesn't. Mother Earth (which, for the record, I also thoroughly enjoy) is the elegant Bohemian beauty next door, who occasionally shakes the flowers out of her hair and slips on a mini. The Unforgiving is Mother Earth's bad-girl half-sister, dolled up in spike heels and leather for a night of hard partying, and daring you to keep up.<br /><br />Track-by-track reviews don't do much for me, so we won't go here. And, for this album, I don't think it would add much: this whole album is a single wild train ride through the night, lights flashing, bells ringing, and whistle sounding. It slows down a little in a couple of places (\\"Fire and Ice\\", \\"Lost\\") to let you catch your breath, but don't be fooled: you'll be screaming over the next hill in a couple of minutes. If you want to get off at each stop and stroll around, you should have taken the bus.<br /><br />That said, it's worth mentioning the consistent high quality of the tracks. There are those legendary albums (Thriller, The Dark Side of the Moon, Zoso, etc.) that take a bunch of tracks that can easily be (and frequently were) massive single hits by themselves, and combine them into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Obviously The Unforgiving won't achieve the legendary status and sales numbers of those blockbusters, but that's because of today's market and WT's place in that market. In the symphonicmetalrock intersection where WT now lives, The Unforgiving sets the bar. Of the 11 music tracks on the CD version, easily 7 could be smash singles.<br /><br />Of the 3 download-only tracks, only \\"I Don't Wanna\\" contends for a place on the album; the other two seem more like stand-alone one-offs. \\"The Last Dance\\" is a particularly odd duck; if someone had played it for me with the vocal dummied out on piano and asked me to guess who wrote it, I'd have probably said \\"Loreena McKennitt\\" (don't worry; that's a good thing).<br /><br />Sharon doesn't quite command the vocal tornado of a legendary rock goddess like, say, Pat Benatar in her prime; in a couple of places, such as toward the end of \\"Iron\\", it feels like Sharon is yelling the lyrics at you rather than singing them to you. But overall this is a powerful step up that ladder. On some past efforts (q.v. Mother Earth again), Sharon has had a tendency to get a little thin/reedy/borderline squeaky. Not here; she grabs this material with both hands, steps up with authority, and slams it down your throat. And you like it. You like it a lot. \\"Thank you, Ma'am; may I have another?\\"<br /><br />If there's any justice out there, The Unforgiving will do for symphonicmetalrock what Fallen did for gothicmetalrock: make people who hadn't even heard of the genre, much less the artist, sit up and say \\"Wow--how have I managed to overlook this amazing stuff?\\"<br /><br />So, if you like symphonic metal, you should by this album. Indeed, if you like rock music of any kind, you should buy this album.<br /><br />Heck, if you have ears that work, you owe it to yourself to listen to this one.The Unforgiving sets the bar.
