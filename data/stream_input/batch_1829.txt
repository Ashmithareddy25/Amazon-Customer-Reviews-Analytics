B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney and the other Stars in this were very funny! This DVD is great and very entertaining! They are so funny looking that just their looks are worth getting the DVD for! The story is Cool and their music and act is great!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|To compare books between this and the first book of the series I kind of like the first one. This one is good but there's more suspense and less romance. I am more of a romance person myself, however I cannot wait til the third one comes out.

B00112GVFO|5.0|Background: After 90-95% of movies I watch, my comment is, \\"that's an hour and half of my life I will never have back.\\"  Not with this movie.  It is one of the best we have watched and has some of the most halarious and creative moments.  They are not cookie cutter one liners like so many movies now. I have to admit some of the plot is pretty ridiculous but is an adventure that is fun and the whole family can watch.  It is my kids (girls 10 and 7) favorite movie as well.  Every trip we take, they want it in the car.  I am suprised we have not worn it out and will buy it again if we do. Definitely worth watching at least once.

B0054LJGWS|3.0|For me, this book was only so-so. It reminded me of books by Christopher Moore; but, didn't quite capture that essence. This book started out fast-paced and really captured my interest. I read the first quarter in one sitting; but, then it sort of stalled for me. All sorts of other characters were introduced who didn't seem like they needed to be there. There were other plot tangents that also seemed to me like they were filling up space. The middle of the book dragged along for me. The end then picked up speed and was satisfying. I think this book would have been better if it would have been about half as long.

006016848X|5.0|I read this book many years ago when I was trying to salvage my marriage and found great wisdom in the words by John Gray.  I recently read another book by an author, Kris Anderson, who writes of Kissing Frogs [[ASIN:0615678556 Kissing Frogs: Tall Tales and Insights from the Dating Pond (Volume 1)]]  and throughout her book it is easy to see she concurs with Gray, even though she has a dash of humor in sharing the tall tales of her dating escapades.  Makes me wonder what Dr. Gray would have to say of those 412 dates!  Men are from mars... is truly a practical guide for improving communication with the opposite sex.<br /><br />Anna Weber   Literary Strategist<br />Voices In Print

0857685570|5.0|This book was a fantastic journey through the career of a Top-Tier 20th Century North American Commercial Artist.  Drew Struzan's personal notes and reflections of what went into making particular pieces, and sometimes the preliminary sketches, really help the reader get a sense of what it took to create these amazing pieces of art.  It's too bad Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo had the ability to do something like this in their time.  I am very grateful that Drew was able to make this book in his lifetime and allow history to catalog his creations and work methods in so much depth.<br /><br />This book is must buy for any fan of 20th Century Movie Poster art, or, any student/lover of Commercial Art.

B004SIP6N6|5.0|Wow, I thought you couldn't get much better than the LaserDisc version of Clerks in quality, strictly because the original movie was shot on grainy 16mm film, but, I was totally wrong.  This Blu-ray version really shows Dave Kleins cinematography in rich new detail that really helps a viewers appreciation of Clerks.<br /><br />The extras on the Bluray were chock full of stuff too, which is totally expected of a Kevin Smith release, but I think they could have mined some of the fan-created material to give the viewer a sense of impact that Clerks had on society and the cinema-world as a whole.  Eh, maybe a 20th Anniversary release we'll see that.  :)<br /><br />All in all, whether you are a first time viewer or a long time fan of Clerks,  this Blu-ray release of Clerks is totally worth a purchase.

B008LC8TJI|3.0|While 2011's smash hit 'Moves Like Jagger' cast massive speculation regarding Maroon 5's direction towards commercialized pop, their follow-up album 'Overexposed' shamelessly confirms it.<br /><br />With Max Martin, the most commercially successful producer of the last 15 years, serving as executive producer as well as co-composer and co-producer of all of the scheduled album singles ('Payphone', 'One More Night' and 'Daylight'), accompanied by Shellback, another hit-making producer who co-wrote the aforementioned 'Moves Like Jagger', the results are undeniably pop-chart oriented as the success of the singles proved for the album.<br /><br />In the spotlight is now Adam Levine, the now unquestionable frontman who directs the band's sound much like Peter Cetera used to do for the band Chicago, and he aptly co-writes all of the material and co-produces nearly every song. This abrupt shift in power leaves the rest of the band reluctantly muted in both songwriting and performance, as their instrumental output is anything but noteworthy midst the electro-pop background music generated by the producers.<br /><br />The gap in quality between the songs made by the aforementioned producers and the rest of the tracks is hence notorious, with little if nothing to make of interest of the album tracks, with the minor exceptions of 'Lucky Strike' and Shellback's 'Doin' Dirt'.<br /><br />If anything, the songs on Overexposed are tied together by unflattering qualities; the album is more often than not bruised by jaded lyrics (e.g. 'Fortune Teller'), and altogether the lack of a unanimous output by both Levine, the producers, and the rest of the band, shines too often to redeem it from its bland, superficial qualities.

0060512806|5.0|Most fiction books that involve computers and math tend to either get them wrong or only skim the surface. This book goes into these wonderful subjects with more depth than is typical. I must thank the author for writing a book that was for me; Not a baby boomer interpretation of me (skate boarding, red bull drinking, hack the DoD in 30 seconds) but a real person who works with computers. Yet this more detailed view of technology does not make the story boring and as for the story it is fun and the characters are good.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone with an IT background.

0375507256|5.0|It hooked me on the first page. I laughed my way through the Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish and cried reading the Orison of Sonmi 451. David Mitchell is an amazing writer, and a human being who honors the sanctity of being one. His talent to portray others with all their foibles and conceits is profound, but even deeper and more beautiful to me is his ability to somehow impart from every page the importance of walking a path in life that honors ourselves and each other. Cloud Atlas is an inspiration. The themes are eternal, human on a cosmic plane.

0345536886|5.0|It's been years since I read a Grisham book. Honestly, I had grown bored with them as can happen when you read multiple books by the same author. Over the past couple of months I have read book after book that hasn't grabbed me, so I decided to head back to an old standard and pick up Grisham's latest book, The Litigators.<br /><br />The Litagators grabbed me from page one and kept me hooked all the way until the end. This was one of those rare books that I had to force myself to put down in order to take care of the mundane like feed the family and sleep. Each character was developed to their potential and brought full circle. This was very satisfying! I appreciated how the author introduced the legal processes involved in this story without dumbing down OR going over the reader's head.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Grisham for a wonderful escape from the day to day routine of life!

B008NBEY3C|5.0|Sony recently released a beautifully executed box set containing all of Yo-Yo Ma's recordings for the label. Now it provides a similarly lavish set celebrating their 40 year association with the 65 year old pianist Murray Perahia. The newer breed of pianists operate under a handicap: they are forced to record in the often oppressive shadow of the past. Iconic musicians such as Horowitz, Rubinstein, Arrau and others have left a brilliant recorded legacy that is easily accessible in the digital age. As children of the Romantic era, these older pianists flaunted a brawny, intimidating virtuosity that younger pianists born in mid-century were disinclined to emulate. The younger generation were also heirs to a tradition of greater pianistic accuracy, fidelity to the composer's wishes and a higher regard for the musical text as written. This has led to a more circumspect keyboard technique featuring less ornamentation, restrained rubato, a conservative use of the pedal and a more thoughtful and carefully crafted intellectual approach to music that is tempered by an historical awareness that was utterly alien to earlier pianists.<br /><br />Born in 1947, Perahia may be the most emblematic of the new breed of pianists. In fact, he declined an offer by Horowitz that he study with him, fearing its effect on his technique. Perahia's playing is refined with an elegant emphasis on clarity of line, discrete use of ornamentation and pedal, and a beauty of tone that can have a crystalline musical purity. But this elegance and clarity extends beyond his own interpretive instrumental efforts and into his conducting technique, especially in his signature Mozart recordings made with the English Chamber Orchestra and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Both youthful ensembles, accompanying an equally youthful piano virtuoso, approached Mozart relatively early in their careers, so that these recordings truly are mutual voyages of musical discovery. There is something quite miraculous in Perahia's readings of Mozart's luminous piano concertos. His approach to these beautiful works can only be described as 'playing them from the inside out'. Because most of the concertos were written for Mozart's own use during the peak of his popularity as a performer between 1784-1786, Perahia seems to play them as if he were the composer. The listener almost inevitably senses the possibility that this is how these concertos might have sounded at one of Mozart's many afternoon musical academies in Vienna. The musical effect can be magical and Perahia's integrated collection of the complete Mozart piano concertos is often cited as one of the finest ever recorded.<br /><br />This box set offers a possible explanation as to why Perahia's Mozart is so highly regarded: five newly re-mastered DVDs featuring nearly 7 hours of film, of which the highlights are the Mozart concertos nos. 14, 20, 21 and 27. Accompanied by the above mentioned ensembles, these recordings contain extensive rehearsal footage, complete with interspersed commentary, that reveals the masterful way Perahia shapes each concerto. He is truly a conductor of distinction and his youthful musicians follow his lead with vigor and brilliance. The result is a revelatory document that uncovers the route by which Perahia arrived at his superb Mozart recordings. DVD 4 is a remastered version of 'Murray Perahia in Performance: The Aldeburgh Recital', originally released on VHS, with the pianist playing works by Rachmaninoff, Beethoven, Schumann and Liszt. The picture and sound are significantly better than in the earlier version. DVDs 1 and 2 are the Mozart concertos, DVD 3 is a 1973 film featuring Perahia playing Scarlatti, Chopin and Mendelssohn. DVD 5 is a gem: the pianist accompanying Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in a 1990 film of Schubert's Winterreise. All 5 DVDs are superb and for me they are worth the purchase price of the entire set. But the box contains so much more. Perahia plays with elegance and taste throughout his recordings of the Romantic repertoire, as well as in his recent foray into the Baroque domain. Especially noteworthy are his lyrical, refined Chopin, his darkly emotional mastery of Brahms' autumnal beauty, and the way that Perahia revels in the sheer intellectual exuberance of Bach and the stately grandeur of Handel.<br /><br />All of the included recordings are musically valuable and contain something of the urgency of beauty that Perahia discovers in the music he records. If you respond to Murray Perahia, then this collection is worth the rather modest outlay for the abundant riches it contains. Even if you already own much of Perahia's recorded catalog, as I do, be advised that all of the analog and early digital recordings (including the Mozart concertos) have been remastered using what sounds like the DSD process. The result is richer sound along with heightened definition and a lovely musical sheen that paints the woodwinds in auditory technicolor. The mature Mozart concertos with their intense dialog between piano and winds have never sounded so glorious. If you love Mozart, you will return to this set again and again. And if you relish the solo piano repertoire that exemplifies the Romantic era, Perahia elevates the signature works of Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Chopin and Brahms into a musical realm of pristine beauty and refinement that is often haunting in its restrained, almost subversive emotional impact. The musical richness of this collection is impressive in its breadth and depth. Perahia's recorded legacy is one in which he can take great pride.<br /><br />Mike Birmanghout his recordings of the Romantic repertoire, as well as in his recent foray into the Baroque domain.

B007IUBU86|5.0|Long time DT fan and I've been following Mike Portnoy for a while now. I just purchased Adrenaline Mob's album Omerta. I haven't been a fan of Symphony X in particular but Russell Allen's vocals are spot on and keep you rocking the entire time. This guy's got such a great sound and amazing range of tone. Guitarist Mike Orlando simply blows me away. His sound is like a mix of Tom Morello and Joe Satriani. It's almost as if he's combined the two to make a sound that is now all his own. And of course, what is there to say about Mike Portnoy that hasn't already been said? He never ceases to amaze me no matter how many time I hear/see him play. He shows here how he can seamlessly go from the hard and heavy to the light and nuanced. Proving that he can change gears from the progressive sound of the conceptual to the rocking sounds of the classic. And that's what you get here with Adrenaline Mob on Omerta. A classic type of sound that many have tried to duplicate but tragically failed. This album grabs you from the start and doesn't let up 'till it's over.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I didn't actually 'purchase' this so much as accidentally hit the 1-click button while watching it on Amazon Prime, so I called customer service and they cancelled the sale. It's not that I wouldn't buy it, but I wouldn't buy it digitally because I prefer to have a physical DVD (etc) copy of my shows.<br /><br />However, I did watch the entire series on Prime, and I still love it as much as I did as a teenager. It is a little bit cheesy feeling at times, watching now as an adult, but certainly no worse than other Trek shows. I was rather shocked in fact to find how many of the plot lines directly parallel current events, metaphorically speaking. The social commentary was also very striking. This really is my favorite Star Trek show, because it goes way out beyond the normal 'Starfleet Crew on a Starship' formula, including a lot more detail on the various alien races of the mythos.<br /><br />Oddly however, most of the Klingon episodes were the ones that bored me, and I have never put my finger on why. Don't take that as a strike against the show though, I think maybe I'm just tired of the focus on that particular group. They still served to push the overall storyline along, at least.<br /><br />So if you never really watched much of it, but like Trek, I highly recommend watching through this series. Yes, there will be some silly or boring episodes, just like pretty much every TV show ever, but I think it's worth it (and I don't really recall many of those).

B003ES61EE|3.0|I got this really cheap when I bought my Canon Eos, and it's all right but it tends to get little lint bits stuck in the brush. The cap doesn't stay on very well either. I've never taken any instructional courses for photography so I'm not even sure what the deal is with the felt pad thing, but I use it to try and get smudges off the lens, which seemed logical. It's ok for that, though it could be better. If you just need something cheap to drag out in the field, this should be fine.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I find it depressingly amazing that anyone who doesn't need to be watered like a plant every day would find this sad excuse for a movie entertaining in any way. A sad excuse on just how simple and stupid so many people are.<br />If you liked this horrible tripe of a movie, what movie won't you like?<br />I would love to know the IQ's of all of you who gave this sad excuse of a film anything more than 1 star.

1451695195|5.0|Just moments ago, I finished reading this book and knew I HAD to review it. I was not really surprised to find that 1,048 others felt exactly the same way. Quite a remarkable thing considering it was released such a short time ago. Dr. Alexander seems to a have touched upon an open wound in our collective consciousness. It's created quite a stir, and for good reason. The book is an outstanding achievement. It is at once, a thoroughly engaging memoir; an entertaining scientific exposition of NDE's; and a deeply moving account of one man's journey in unraveling one of Life's great mysteries ~ Consciouness itself.<br />After all the 'Sound and Fury' surrounding this book settles down, it will inevitably endure as a timeless classic in its field. The sheer mastery of the literary form by Dr. Alexander to convey his experience in such a sincere, engaging, and emotionally powerful way, places his book head and shoulders above others of its kind. Moody himself, an icon in the field of NDEs, said it was the best book on the subject he'd ever read. After reading it yourself, I'm sure you'll understand why.<br /><br />As many have said, this book rings true on SO many levels that one feels as if Dr. Alexander has somehow stirred the embers of our own remembering. If you feel that you and I have similar interests; that we are perhaps even kindred spirits, and you find yourself on my 'Read All My Reviews' page, I can only say, from the deepest part of me ~ READ THIS BOOK!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This was a gift.  It appeared to be in great shape and arrived quickly.  It is currently traveling to the Bahamas to be enjoyed later.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its a great game, only problem is that when you levee the game it may not save not sure how it work. I do know that I exited out once at level 5 and put me back a level when I got back on. still its a rock paper scissors type.

0142501123|5.0|As a teacher to a room of second graders I thought this might be a little too advanced for my toddler. Boy, was I wrong! He loves the rhyming prose, the deeply saturated/ intense illustrations and story arch. Please don't think I am bragging: just wanted to say that this awesome little read is not only a great way to help your seven year old learn to read (many of the adjectives used are actual spelling words / high frequency words for 2nd quarter of second grade) it's a great way to get your 3 year old to fall in love with story telling.
B005LAII12|5.0|This was one of my favorite films this year.  It is both side-splittingly funny and rather heart-warming as well.  In short, Ted will make you laugh and cry.<br /><br />The good news here is that this DVD is fully loaded -- it contains the theatrical version of the film, an unrated version with an additional six minutes of ursine misbehavior, a funny gag reel, various making-of featurettes, and a director's commentary.<br /><br />All the stuff too many movie companies have been reserving only for BluRay, when we KNOW many of these features will fit on a DVD as well!<br /><br />Special shout-outs must go to Ted himself, a sweet-looking Teddy who comes to life at a little boy's wish and matures into a raunchy, pot-smoking, beer-guzzling, ho-hiring roommate for the boy, now a man, Bostonite John Bennett, played by Mark Wahlberg.  Wahlberg and Mila Kunis must be singled out for special praise as well, as they respond to the outrageous bear as though he is as real as rain.  They sell the effect.<br /><br />And indeed, as voiced and motion-captured by the director and writer Seth McFarlane, Ted is an entirely credible and show-stealing performer in every shot and scene.<br /><br />Further kudos go to Giovanni Ribisi as a nutty father who is determined to bearnap Ted for his Puggsley-like son to play with and deliver painful \\"ouches\\" to.<br /><br />At any rate, if you want to see a very different kind of bromance movie, you should definitely check out this R-rated bear.  And if you like the movie, you will assuredly want the DVD, both for the extras and the many gut-busting comedic lines you didn't hear among all the mayhem the first or even second times around.<br /><br />Four paws up!

B004FRX0MY|4.0|This app hasn't blown me away or anything, but it does what it is supposed to. I ended up deleting it off my phone, but that wasn't because it was a bad app. My phone just doesn't have a lot of storage so if I find an app that I do not use often, I quickly delete them.
B009IU6N5Y|1.0|I like sci-fi and I like history. But there is no believability in the sci-fi and no history in this history. I suppose if your brain is only capable of producing feelings, then this fantasy might entertain you. But if you want some intelligence in your sci-fi, then keep looking.

B007BZM3HK|5.0|I think Carly Rae Jepsen will be around for quite a while so we better get used to her. This song is very catchy and cute, and always gets stuck in my head. I do think it's a little funny that she is 27 and singing such young songs, but Katy Perry is about her age too and sings the same kind of music, so I guess it's really smart of them to target young kids with their music because they are the ones that will get them rich and famous. :)  She seems like a nice girl and I am looking forward to hearing some of her other songs.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The tale of the protagonist's survival after the shipwreck in which lost his family is unique and engrossing. It shows how a person's beliefs and behavior change when he has to confront tough choices for survival. The description of Pi's life in Pondicherry where his father owns a zoo is also interesting.<br /><br />Couple of things I did not like about the story<br />- The injection of the author's views about animals' life in zoos and the odd way that faith/atheism is mentioned towards the conclusion of the book.<br />- The snippets of Pi meeting some one in Canada present randomly throughout the book.

B00AE2J5HI|3.0|(If I could, it'd be a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars). I liked the history and feel of this period drama, but some of the scenes are a bit stilted and drawn out to the point of awkwardness. Overall, I enjoyed it though, and the only complaint I have is that it was a little difficult to understand the dialogue in a few instances. It could be the Aussie accents combined with the actor's mumbling portrayal of the character.  And, due to it being a download, I didn't have CC to help me out?!! (Wish the FCC would make CC mandatory with all downloads just like Network programming - available with each and every movie we rent or purchase)!<br />PS- I doubt your younger children should see or would even enjoy this movie?! Some of the violence is very graphic.

B004GTLFNW|4.0|This is an excellent foundation companion to the app by the same name found on iTunes.  In my opinion, the app is superior to the book because the latest version contains timed workouts, HD videos of each workout that shows the exact correct technique, automatic tracking of your progress, voice prompts, and it is cheaper.  I purchased the book when the app was in version 1.0 - since that time the app has progressed substantively.  The book is nice to have, but the app and app explanation behind each workout is completely adequate.

B0000AC8N4|5.0|History tells us that during the early 1960's,the popularity of jazz music was being confined more and more to nightclubs and the type of cult audience it has largely enjoyed ever since. During this period a lot of the music's biggest surviving innovators of the day were either deeply effected by addiction problems or were about to enter the musical unemployment line. There was also the option of moving ones address to Europe,ideally France. Here jazz's popularity had continued to grow since the jazz age of the 1920's. By the early 60's it was at the point where the music and what it inspired had become deeply ingrained into their popular culture. This meant that American jazz musicians would have no trouble finding work there. In 1962 Dexter Gordon made the risky decision to take the plunge across the pond to reinvent his career in a more overall fruitful setting. This was his first recording at the CBS studios in Paris-recording with the company of two other ex-patriot musicians in the person of drummer Kenny Clarke and of course pianist Bud Powell.<br /><br />  Containing a series of standards written within the last decade or two,this particular album was a complete change of direction for Dexter Gordon. With his new quartet,including local bass player Pierre Michelot,take a much more theatrical rhythmic approach on  Bird's \\"Scrapple In The Apple\\",also finding Dexter playing his saxophone in a far more aggressive and abstract manner-more in line with the be-bop approach to sax playing than his more fluid swing style of his earlier recordings. On \\"Willow Weep For Me\\" Dexter hits right on his original playing style yet again on an eight plus minute blues whereas \\"Stairway To The Stars\\" maintains the slower flavor with a more upbeat melody. Of course on another eight minute extravaganza in Dizzy's \\"A Night In Tunisia\\",Dexter gives it his all;he's swinging,bopping and playing the blues all at once here and it's my favorite here actually. The original album concludes with a swinging uptempo version of Gershwin's \\"Our Love Is Here To Stay\\",there's the bonus track of \\"Like Someone To Love\\",a more elaborate swing with Pierre getting a bass solo on the bridge.<br /><br />  Though it's clear from the beginning this quartet seems to consist of four very fixed musical personalities as opposed to the synergy generated by Sonny Clark,Butch Warren and Billy Higgins there was the clear point made that the change in approach and style did Dexter Gordon some good. He would spend the next decade and a half gigging successfully around Europe. In the mid 1970's,he'd stage a successful comeback in America. But more than anything this album showcased the difference between the priorities of jazz in America versus Europe. Most of the successful jazz musicians in the US during this era were either playing some variation of melodic swing,the most commercially popular variety of jazz in the country-be it jump blues or closer to rock n roll,or were part of the Dixieland revival of the time. In Europe however,the art/music scene was inspired by the musical progression of bop oriented sub genre's of jazz. So creatively there was more room for expansion for jazz musicians in a musical environment not quite so defined by rigid commercialism. And Dexter just flew with that concept here.with a swinging uptempo version of Gershwin's \\"Our Love Is Here To Stay\\",there's the bonus track of \\"Like Someone To Love\\",a more elaborate swing with Pierre getting a bass solo on the bridge.<br /><br />  Though it's clear from the beginning this quartet seems to consist of four very fixed musical personalities as opposed to the synergy generated by Sonny Clark,Butch Warren and Billy Higgins there was the clear point made that the change in approach and style did Dexter Gordon some good.

B008G12ERC|2.0|Going into this album, I had high expectations from Muse. They were one of my favorite bands and all of their albums have been great (even though many people seem to have disliked The Resistance more than I would expect). After hearing Survival before the Olympics, my expectations only went higher: the rhythm section sounded massive, Matt's guitar work and vocals were fantastic, but the lyrics were horrible, which I've learned to expect and ignore from the trio. Then come Madness (which sounded like the same exact thing happening for 2.5 minutes followed by a U2 cover) and Unsustainable (which is far less creative than people give it credit for), and my expectations plummeted. However, I still had hope. Muse would be able to pull off a great album! Well, I was wrong.<br /><br />Supremacy - One of my favorite tracks on the album, and a strong opener. It definitely has the James Bond theme vibe and sounds great.<br /><br />Madness - As mentioned above, very disappointing. I'm also shocked that this song was nominated for best Rock single at the Grammys.<br /><br />Panic Station - Not bad, but sounds too much like an amalgamation of Thriller and Superstition than a Muse song. Also, it probably has the worst lyrics on the album.<br /><br />Prelude/Survival - Great! While the Prelude wasn't entirely necessary, it sounded good, and my only complaint about Survival is the choir.<br /><br />Follow Me - Dubstep song number one, except they didn't even bother to use their instruments for this one. The entire song is quite bland, and Matt's vocals don't sound anywhere near as good as on other songs, which is a problem when they're the only appealing thing about the song.<br /><br />Animals - This song definitely caught me off guard, but is probably my favorite on the album. The subdued vocals and flamenco-ish guitar work together awesomely, Chris's bass and the keys carry the harmony well, and Dom's drumming is slightly less boring than the rest of the album (which I don't think is his fault either). The ending was pretty crappy, but no complaints otherwise.<br /><br />From here on out, everything goes downhill...<br /><br />Explorers - Well, this is another one of the boring songs on the album. And the key change towards the end of the song was absolutely unnecessary.<br /><br />Big Freeze - Muse's cheesiest sounding song, by far. The vocals sound great (well, excluding the choir), but that's about it.<br /><br />Save Me - Chris's vocals sound pretty cool, and I'd like to hear more of them in the future, but the song itself is so boring and doesn't develop into anything.<br /><br />Liquid State - Unnatural Selection 2.0, which is funny because a lot of people called Unnatural Selection a rehash of New Born. This song had no point.<br /><br />The 2nd Law: Unsustainable - This song started out promisingly enough, as the orchestral parts sound fantastic, yet wasted. This song was far from being anything special for many reasons. 1 - contrary to popular belief, Muse were not the first to play dubstep on instruments, though they were probably the first major band to do so. 2 - All they did was play dubstep on their instruments, which is nothing remotely special. It could be compared to how \\"unique\\" playing a pop vocal part on trumpet would be. 3 - The \\"dubstep\\" section was played pretty much note-for-note twice, making the song structure Intro->Dubstep->Bridge->Dubstep. This song could have been far better if it was developed better and had greater variation.<br /><br />The 2nd Law: Isolated System - Up until the end, this song sounded fantastic, building and building towards what would inevitably be an album-redeeming climax!  .........except nothing happened. The song builds and ends, leaving a potentially awesome post-rock-esque closer to be just another disappointing song.<br /><br />So, my rating: 2 stars. Why? I liked 4 songs out of 13, the songs didn't flow well at all, too many songs sound half-baked (Isolated System being the worstoffender), the rhythm section sounded suppressed outside of Survival and Liquid State, and the instrumentation in general was so dull that the vocals remain as the only appealing detail most of the time. Muse need to worry about making good music instead of trying to create an album that contains songs that wouldn't fit on any of their past albums. They certainly succeeded at that though - most of the songs on their past albums don't suck.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. Can not put it down. I wish I could find more books that are this enthralling.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|Beautiful. I resisted Lana for a time, listening to all the negative hype from small-minded people. Critics suck. They complain but cannot \\"DO\\". I love this follow-up and can't wait until there is a new full disc of her music. Thank you Lana Del Rey. Most music is crap nowadays. She is original, while familiar. Surprising, while insightful.<br />As much as I have played her first collection over and over, it was not until listening to this that I realized who she reminds me of: Marianne Faithful, at times. Only a more updated, rooted in todays culture Marianne Faithful.<br />Be surprised, be comforted, but enjoy Lana Del Rey.

B005LAIIQC|3.0|Let me first say that I think the movie is great.  This review is based on the Blu-Ray implementation.  I have never seen such a poorly thought out/bad customer experience as shown by this Blu-Ray.<br />I popped it into my PS3 (what I use to watch all my Blu-Rays), and it took well over a minute to load, with a little animated Universal logo. The screen resolution changed on my screen, more animated logo... another resolution change, more animated logo.<br />Then, I saw &#34;Loading some fresh movie trailers from the Internet&#34; message.  Wait, what? It's loading trailers, without my permission from the Internet (in HD no less), when I'm trying to watch a movie.  Fortunately, I was able to press &#34;next chapter&#34; to skip past the commercials, one after each other, with three total.<br />But then, it just sat there.  almost confused.  After 4 minutes, I gave up, and exited the movie, back to the PS3 home screen.<br /><br />I tried it again, this time it seemed much faster, just a 1 minute delay, 1 minute for the Universal logo splash screen, then straight to &#34;loading fresh trailers&#34;.  Skipped 3 commercials and it finally loaded the disc menu.<br /><br />After that, the movie played fine.  But, what an annoying experience!

B003UHYSDK|5.0|Black Mountain - Wilderness Heart, Jagjaguwar Records (2010)<br /><br />  Black Mountain's 3rd album is yet another wonderful and powerful album!  Once again they play with a sound like an ode to the forefathers.....Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.  Stephen McBean fuzzed out guitars along with Amber Webber's vocals creates a combo that you have to hear.  Let me say that Wilderness Heart is not for the \\"weak at heart\\" with its thumping and pounding bass and drum interplay.  This album was nicely recorded and sounds fantastic on a good stereo.  This album is less progressive than their previous \\"In The Future\\" and feels more stripped down and straight forward.<br />  This album has the right mix of organ pumps and synth runs as well helping to create that  BIG WALL OF SOUND they love to play within.  Overall a striking album with some great songs and a real heavy vibe that you don't hear much these days anymore.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Another great read.  It's great watching Ana work through the complexity of Christian's past but isn't that what all relationships are about?  And to think, the lifestyle was an avenue for expression and relief...will that change?
B000NQR7LQ|5.0|Genesis - Wind & Wuthering (1977)  SACD<br /><br />In 1977 something happened to Genesis........The album was `Wind and Wuthering`` and the music carried the deep musical progressions of early Genesis with some lighter poppy tendencies which started to creep into their music.  I am a Genesis fan....always have been and always will be and slowly I have been picking up all the Nick Davis SACD Remasters as I find them reasonably priced....as you know there are some lunatics asking way too much for these discs.<br />If you are not familiar with the post Gabriel era Genesis then I can assure you that Phil Collins does a reasonable job on the vocals in replacement of Peter Gabriel. Musically \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" from 1977 was another great album from this band who began on this album to show signs of pop and progressive rock combined. No question that Afterglow is one of the truly great Genesis tracks! ...still give me the shivers when I hear it....<br /><br />Now how is the SACD transfer you ask ? well....I can assure you that this is an excellent transfer that sounds great. Excellent clarity and nice instrumental depth. Nick Davis is responsible for the 5.1 mix and unlike many of the critics out there I think he did a very good job on these albums. The music is bright and clear and in many ways I feel like I have never heard the album until now !<br />I also have been able to hear things that I never heard before from my vinyl and 1st edition CD sources.<br />If you are a fan of Genesis or this album then I recommend you pick it up.......

B0012GMUI6|5.0|Roger Waters - The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking<br /><br />  ..For the first time today......(sorry i used the US album cover.......just gotta keep it censored proof)<br /><br />  The Pros and Cons was his 1984 masterpiece concept album based on a rather bizarre hitch hiking expedition gone wrong.....or right ....depends on how you look at this I guess !<br />  Roger Waters continues here very much where 'The Final Cut' left off basically with a deep collaboration of rock and classical genres.  This album being in fact co-produced by both Waters and Michael Kamen (yup the same guy who wrote a ton a soundtrack music scores...including my fav Band Of Brothers!) .  Waters is at his best here for sure and fans of Pink Floyd will love this album.<br /><br />  Typical of Roger's music it ebbs and flows and along the way you are treated to some fantastic melodies and musical bits.<br /><br />  There is no shortage of sound bytes and samples from the imagination of Roger Waters as well all the way thru making this feel more like a movie soundtrack than an solo album.<br /><br />  All lyrics and music was written by Roger Waters with some great musical guests contributing to this masterpiece....Eric Clapton - Electric Guitar, Andy Bown - Hammond Organ & 12 String Guitar , Ray Cooper - Percussion, Michael Kamen - Piano,<br />Andy Newmark - Drums, David Sanborn - Saxophone with backing vocals by Madeline Bell, Katie Kissoon and Doreen Chanter.  The National Philharmonic Orchestra was conducted and arranged by Michael Kamen.

It seemed at the time that the Moody`s could do no wrong with yet again this album reaching number 1 in the UK and number 2 in the US Charts.<br /><br />Yet with Every Good Boy Deserves Favour things really started to change for the Moody Blues.<br /><br />EGBDF represented for the Moody`s a shift from the mellotron soaked passages to a more Moog synth dominated album yet remained still lush and symphonic. The Moody`s even changed labels moving from the familiar haunts of Decca to use other studio and engineers. The album was released on their own label Threshold and sold very well at the time and remains among Moody Fans on the great treasured albums.<br /><br />Sonically this album is once again darn near perfect for my ears as the SACD was lifted straight from the original Quad masters and offers amazing separation and tone clarity.<br /><br />I am sure there are many who will dis this gem but take it from me (a huge fan of the Moody`s) that this SACD is essential and sonically beautiful.<br /><br />They just dont make music like this any more.........
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|I listened to the NPR preview of this record for days... when it became unavailable... I had to buy it right away.<br />This is a great group, a great album.
B0002DSUEI|5.0|Diana Krall - Love Scenes (1997), Verve Music , SACD<br /><br />  Love Scenes was Diana's 4th studio album and in the spirit of a themed album recorded songs that all had a connection to love.  With her regular guitarist Russell Malone and bassist Christian McBride, Krall performs 12 wonderfully jazzed up songs that obviously touched her soul somewhere along life's path....and now will touch yours too !<br />  I love Krall's selection of songs as many of these songs my mom would play on the piano as I grew up....songs by Peggy Lee, Ira & George Gershwin and  Irving Berlin.<br /> Sonically this album is pretty much picture perfect with it's sparkling wide dynamic range and full soundscape.  They took extreme care in the recording of this album....and this album must be heard on a good stereo to really get !  Audiophiles will debate I am sure the 5.1 Mix back and forth but ignoring all that noise trust me in saying that this and the other early Diana Krall SACD albums are just simply stunning.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3D was great. Loved seeing the movie the way it was when I first watched it in the movies
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt - The Book Of Secrets , Quinlan Road Records (1997)<br /><br />  With so much written on Loreena and her music there really is not anything I could possibly add really to help highlight the magic of her music and in particular this album.  \\"The Book of Secrets\\" like all her albums is truely a musical journey  into a celtic land where mystics and the ancients are still practiced.  Her music is delicate and beautiful  yet exotic and progressive where her soundscapes are only limited to the imagination of the listener.  The sonic quality of this remastered CD is quite stunning and offers a  nice wide audio panoramic for the listener to fully soak up.
B0001I55OC|4.0|I had read the book years ago and then saw the movie on TV.  So, I went to Amazon and ordered the movie.  The movie was done very well, folloewd the basic storyline that I remembered from the.  There was plenty of action.  This movie is part of my main collection.  I would recommend it.
B0000256KE|5.0|Roxy Music - For Your Pleasure, Virgin Records, 1973 (2008 Remaster)<br /><br />  Brian Eno, Brian Ferry....the first 2 Roxy albums are a coin toss for me with \\"For Your Pleasure\\" standing out as an album I will always love and i hope you agree is a fine choice for this BLOG.  Intriguing, creative and yet totally \\"Roxy\\", this album nice balances the controlled and cool tendencies of Ferry with the experimental and improvised mannerisms of Eno.  This variation is quite evident as songs range from the driving singles \\"Do the Strand\\" and \\"Editions of You\\" to the slow and almost-eerie \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache,\\" with with atonal synthesizer textures which seem to fit perfectly with Ferry's sedated vocals.  High on the creativity and inspiration front, this album is an essential listen.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I wanted to add this song to my collection.  I now have a larger MP3 player with room for more music so I am adding additional songs that I didn't have room for before.
B000E8NQUE|5.0|The Moody Blues - On The Threshold Of A Dream (1969)  SACD<br /><br />\\"On The Threshold Of A Dream\\" is one of my all time favorite albums! And what better way to enjoy it than in glorious SACD !<br /><br />Once again this SACD is taken from the quadraphonic mix masters recorded in 1969 and the sound is simply breathtaking......The voices are very clearly defined as is the instrumentation with a nice deep rich sound.<br /><br />Musically this album is dreamy and deeply rich with lots of mellotron and vocal harmonies.  This was the Moody`s at arguably their best with a great mix of progressive, pop and psychedelic genres<br /><br />I would highly recommend this album to all lovers of The Moody Blues.
6305508550|4.0|Had to own it.  Don't know why I didn't buy it sooner.  Anyone who has ever worked in an office needs to see this movie.  And don't forget your pieces of flare.
1609611543|5.0|I am amazed at how little thought we give the food we eat. This book is a great eye opener.
B002N57KG2|4.0|I bought it originally on VHS.  I have been updating my library to DVD and decided that it was time to update Cannonball Run.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have been using this app for several weeks now and couldn't be more pleased. I now can see precisely where I am with battery life and know how much time I have for each activity.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is one of the best Majhong games I have ever played, and for the cost, it definitely makes it the best!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book made me cry, shiver, laugh, love, and cry some more.... this book made me feel so deeply for the characters that I cried and cried and cried at the end.... this is one of the best books I have ever read and I suggest it to anyone searching for a book with heart
B009VB97EY|5.0|Entertaining...a little racy for me, but I enjoyed it just the same...Glad my 13 year old was not home to watch it
B0016OMFNY|5.0|I've always enjoyed this album, and have not been able to find it anywhere.<br />I found it at Amazon, thank goodness.  I had this album on tape back in the &#34;olden&#34; days and it got worn out from too much play.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|The kids and I watched it the other night and enjoyed it very much. It's nice to have movies the entire family can watch together
B0000069DB|5.0|Rossini - Il Turco in Italia / Bartoli, Corbelli, Pertusi, Vargas, Teatro alla Scala, Chailly isa 1998 Decca Record Company recording starring Cecilia Bartoli in the role as Fiorilla. Riccardo Chailly leads this recording from the famous La Scala. The sound quality is superb and Baroli is amazing as always. The booklet contains well-written music notes and a synopsis alongst with all the lyrics and short biographies of the performers. Truly a magnificent recording. Highly recommended. 5/5.
6305428050|5.0|My hubby enjoyed the movie, very good actors in it!! I am very happy, thank you very much!! Thank you again.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is basically \\"Glee: The Movie.\\" And with an all-girls approach to it. The marketing made it seem like Fat Amy is the star of the film, when it's really Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, although Amy (Rebel Wilson) steals the spotlight in most scenes she's in, and is the real star. The premise is the stuffy and traditional acapella girls group The Bellas gets a fresh breath of air when they recruit the less attractive, but more energetic new girls following an embarassment from last year that has left them on the bottom of the college social ladder. Pretty much, the same kind of \\"new guy/girl comes in and shakes things up\\" premise in any movie starring college students. The movie is funny, but moreso for women than men, most likely. It's a fun, neat little Comedy/Musical, but it's nothing new or original. Plus, the singing is good, with a lot of recognizable songs.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Not quite sure if that's good or bad, but it's definitely fun. Would definitely recommend especially if you're fond of amusement park games.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|this was everything i expected,thanks for fast service.A+A+A+.looking to get more from here.if you like the beach boys,you will love this one.
0425264351|1.0|The one positive thing I can say about this book is that it has lowered my expectations for the upcoming \\"Jack Reacher\\" movie to the point that the film cannot be a disappointment.<br /><br />That said, let's discuss this book specifically. It is so bad that the only reason I forced myself to finish it was because I wanted to be completely fair in this review, just in case it had some whopper of an ending. It didn't. Clawing my own eyes out would have been worse than reading this book -- but just barely.<br /><br />Many other \\"one-star\\" reviews have made the same points, but some points merit reiteration.<br /><br />Lee Child has obviously chosen to ignore the time-tested writer's maxim to \\"write what you know.\\" Because he knows nothing about police work, firearms, the military, the federal government, or counterfeiting U.S. currency. I happen to know a good deal about nearly all of those things, the only exception being counterfeiting, but even that I do know something about.<br /><br />The entire plot is based on an absurd coincidence that even the characters apparently find hard to believe, given that Jack Reacher himself comments on the absurdity of it. Then what follows from that is so implausible, so ridiculous that it has the feel of farce. Sort of like trying to take an Austin Powers movie seriously, like comparing SKYFALL to THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME.<br /><br />Then there is the writing itself. What does Mr. Child have against sentences that contain a subject? About 2/3 of the sentences in the novel begin with the verb and have had their subjects lopped off. I'm a fan of sentence fragments when used for affect, but when fragments make up more than half of the narrative, the result is so annoying it makes reading almost painful. The book reads as if Mr. Child's editors told him to shorten the manuscript and he did so by simply cutting off the first word of most of the sentences. A better idea to shorten the manuscript would have been to cut all the redundant sentences, of which there are many. Or maybe cut 50 or 60 of the 120 times he used the word \\"shrugged.\\"<br /><br />The first surprise I had in reading this book was how bad it was. The second surprise, which actually eclipsed the first, was discovering how many five-star reviews it has received -- 270 so far!<br /><br />Did those reviewers read the same book I did? I don't see how that is possible. The greatest mystery in this quasi-mystery novel is how so many people could find it so good. Seriously, more than three times more five-stars than three-stars? That many more people found this book excellent than found it merely good? To paraphrase Hamlet, something is rotten in the state of Denmark.<br /><br />To summarize: This books is terrible. The plot is so stupid, filled with some many holes, and so implausible that it would destroy even a well-written book. Unfortunately, this is a very poorly written book by someone with no demonstrated knowledge of the subject matter.<br /><br />And then there's the dialogue and internal monologues of the hero, Jack Reacher. How about this jewel, \\"Shotguns and children don't mix.\\" Mr. Child not only has Reacher tell us that once, which was bad enough, but he wanted to drive home the point by having Reacher share that pearl of wisdom with us twice.<br /><br />Which brings me to the third, and biggest, surprise of all, which was learning that this book was the genesis for a series that spans nearly 20 books. How on earth that happened, I have no idea, other than to acknowledge that I am hopelessly out of touch with what constitutes a good book. So by all means, if you think Jerry Springer or Keeping Up With The Kardashians is great TV, then you might very well love KILLING FLOOR.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book is about two lost souls with troubled pasts who fall in love and do their best to fight the demons that haunt them both.  Yes, there is a lot of violence.  If you want to read a book where two people fall in love and everyday is full of puppies and rainbows, this is not the book for you.  However, if you want to read a book with lots of drama and an addicting love story, then you will most likely enjoy this book.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I'm a frequent watcher of foreign films, and this one was quite appealing and extremely insightful.  Jiro is an 85 year old restaurant owner, presumably one of the most expensive at $300 per plate.  The restaurant seats 10, counter-style seating.<br /><br />There are various elements of fascination to this film, one being the open fish markets, the work ethic of Jiro and how his sons react to that, and of course the restaurant where one needs a month in advance reservation.  But, moreso interesting was the wisdom of Jiro, his style for mastering his craft, and the \\"orchestration\\" of the dinner served.<br /><br />This is a complete insight into the world of sushi, the cooks, the patrons, and how this seemingly and amazing dinner is prepared.  The training of his cooks and/or apprentices is beyond what one learns in a restaurant.  It is repetition that makes one a master.<br /><br />The documentary also takes one on a trip where Jiro visits aging school friends.<br /><br />If you love food, and love sushi, it is well worth it to see the Jiro style of sushi, wisdom, craft, family, and patrons.....  Excellent film, Rizzo.
0425263916|5.0|Sylvia Day presents a series that is pure escapeism.  Enjoyable fantasy to be read leisurely.  I have purchased her series involving Gideon and Eva.  Love them!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Excellent insider view about some of the inconsistencies of science fiction.  And yet, extremely personal, never forgetting the human element.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander has great credibility with the medical/scientific community. His writing is direct and reasonable about his remarkable personal experience. My engineer husband practically read the whole book aloud to me, he was so enthused with its unfolding. I ordered another copy that we gave to his Dad, a retired Army Officer, and he is equally as inspired by this book. Neither will ever be &#34;religious,&#34; but they are both enjoying exploring their respective spirituality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Literally could not put it down until I finished reading it. I defenetly recommend to those who like a book to be filled with suspence.
1932100660|5.0|If you want to &#34;go to the doctor and think they'll fix you with expensive tests & drugs, don't read this&#34;.  If you want to continue on your path without making changes, read this book anyway.  I did the challenge and have to admit I feel better, my abdomen is thinning and I have less aches.  I'm already a health nut by most people's standards.  I don't think you have to be strictly religious with this, however it REALLY merits your attention and you'll benefit if you meet it even 1/2 way.  (obviously the greater effort the greater the benefit) It's important to consider who is behind the bulk of studies in this country; those who have financial interests- naturally, then they &#34;recommend what we should eat&#34;.  The whole milk in the schools thing and I being  raised in a dairy state almost feels sacrilegious to delete from my life.  Have you noticed people are still on the low carb or no carb bandwagon still, and they're preaching this to everyone else.  Sure, the quality of our grains and genetically modified plants are a concern, but some good arguments are made in this book.  How did obesity,  diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attack, kidney failure become so prevalent?  Most people aren't eating plant based foods; bottom line.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I love the movie. Richard Harris was born to be King Arthur as he insisted and eventually won the part.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a very good movie! This is definately one for the collection! I can't wait for the next one!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Just so you know, I generally vote conservative and really don't like either party that much.  AndI really appreciated the info in this movie.  I thought it was as balanced as perhaps it could be since Monsanto et al wouldn't go on record.  Pretty sad how some attorneys will sell their souls for a bigger house.  God bless the ones who didn't.<br /><br />Watch this, it's info you need to be aware of.
B006H5120E|5.0|My wifes favorite movie, so I could not pass it up! I'm happy as long as she don't make me watch it!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I need friends to progress and I have no facebook and made gameloft account but how do I get friends!? I like it more in dragon story of how u get friends. also I wish I could buy doctor whooves with in game money not real money with only a small chance to get him! overall I think it is a nice game,  great for any mlp fans, just wish I didn't have to get friends to progress or to get hearts. and I WANT DOCTOR WHOVES! that and the friends is the only part that really pisses me off.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Finally a band that can make an album that is worth buying and listening to the entire album. If you haven't checked out this band you really should buy this album and listen to the entire thing. The lyrics to each song makes you think and this band is extremely tallented musically. Don't stop at this album however, because some of their best work is on other albums....
0785163174|4.0|I haven't followed comics in probably 15 years. Having not read comics in such a long time it was easy enough to get familiar with all the major players in this series because their core intentions and motives haven't changed over the years. I was very interested in this event though due to the stand alone popularity of both groups.<br /><br />This story doesn't disappoint as far as coming up with a plausible reason these 2 factions would go to war with each other. It moves along at a good pace throughout, which was somewhat surprising. Having read other story arc's in the past, involving some of the characters portrayed here, they typically have what I consider &#34;filler issues&#34; to just make money and slowly progress the main story. This series did not seem to have that as it was well paced and really the action started right away.<br /><br />The only thing I thought could have been better would have been to just have 1 artist handle this whole collection rather than a couple of different ones. The character's looks don't change drastically but I would have enjoyed it to stay consistent throughout. That is probably my only gripe with the series. Well done storyline, lots of extra digital content through the Marvel AR app, and at the price of the collection you can't beat it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|can u create animals in this game? like wolves bears and other animals? please answer soon!!!!!!! Ps sounds like an awesome game!
1451695195|5.0|This was a fascinating book. A lot of wise things that rang true to me.<br /><br />I am no longer surprised when after finding a wonderful book, I then see a lot of doubters and haters  of it in the Amazon reviews. Usually, as in the case of this book, they are thankfully in the minority. Just ignore their negativity and close-mindedness and read this book anyway.<br /><br />This book gives every indication to me that the author is sincere and is genuinely trying to share something valuable with the world. I found what he said to be valuable.<br /><br />His explanations about the meaning and purpose of life are pretty closely aligned with what I believe as a Mormon, even though some of the specifics of what he saw sound a bit strange. But I'm prepared to believe it's a big universe to experience and try to comprehend \\"on the other side.\\"<br /><br />I thank the author for having the courage and honesty to write this book.<br /><br />As with all these NDE books, there is a lot about the illness, the author's background, etc. I always skip over that and just read the actual NDE account. However, this book also includes many chapters where the author analyzes and tries to synthesize what he learned - those chapters were also great.<br /><br />If you liked this book, also check out [[ASIN:080079432X Return from Tomorrow]].
B0031RAOVY|5.0|of my favorite movies, kind of sad, but I've watched it more than once, shared it with kids they loved it.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|really did like the series. wish it could continue. very intense scenes and just the right amount of nudity. more towards the action side but the passion is there too. the characters did a good job protraying what life was like for the privelidged few while the masses were slaves or commonfolk. treachery was rampant and a knife was not far away,either. very watchable and bold and a credit to the actors and actresses who protrayed the villians and hereos. applaud. applaud. applaud.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fell in love with Ken Follet after reading &#34;Pillar of the Earth&#34;  Adore his style of writing! My favorite author of all time!!
0525952926|1.0|I have never written a review for any book. First I respect any writer attempting to write a novel that moves us and we can relate to. Regardless of their success we sometimes have no idea how much it really takes to write a novel (research/time)about who we are, the human condition so to speak. After reading book two of the trilogy I was greatly disappointed. Boring. Just plain boring. There's no need to be descpitive about what's wrong it just isn't good.  I thought book one was a great novel. Every review I read with a 2 star or under rating says it all and I agree totally. I have no reason to look forward to book 3. I thought 2012 was not a good year for many authors/books. Too much formula, lack of imagination. It's not just Folliet it's the market. We don't need series with predetermined formulas just original, imaginative, creative writing in the form of one complete story/novel no matter what the genre. If your fan of Ken Folliett cool, but to be truly introduced to Ken Folliett read Eye of The Needle or Keys to Rebecca.
1878424319|1.0|The 4 agreements are interesting in themselves, and I looked them up on Google a while back to get a basic explanation of them.  The book was far less useful than the Google search.  I was hoping that it might explain why these 4 agreements were chosen over other possibilities - why these 4 are so fundamental.  It does nothing of the sort.
B005LAII08|5.0|This was a classic story about a rebelious princess and how she comes to realize that being stubborn will hurt the ones around you that you love.  It has amazing animation, great scenery, and memorable characters.  It also came in 3D which in this movie, did not seem to pop out that much at first, but after watching it in 2d, I definately appreciated how much depth the 3D gave the setting and scenery.  Definately worth the buy because you will watch it again, especially if you have kids.
1400052173|5.0|This book is an amazing tribute to Henrietta Lacks as well as her family. It is well-written, reads like a novel, well-researched and written with heart for the family's turmoil and love for an amazing woman, in life as in death. This book should be recommended reading in every high school classroom in America!
B0085YNML2|5.0|This game is really adorable and addictive! Plus, it's FREE! I just got it and I've been playing it for hours! I love it!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Ok, its a super fun game where you build stuff for a pig to ride in, really fun and chalanging... but today when I whent to play, all my saved data was gone!!! I still have no idea wat happened, so plz fix the glitch Rovio.
B00457WZEI|4.0|An excellent book, very easy to read. I read it in one sitting and finished with tears in my eyes.  I shall give it to my nine year old daughter next. I haven't seen the movie but I don't think it could properly represent the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|hey people. 11 year old genius to hit you with some knowledge.  look this app is amazing. after you update it it gets even better. I will admit it doesn't have the nether. at least that's what I think. get this app and it wont dissapoint you.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Not the type of movie I prefer to watch, to much gore, fair 3D effects. I would rather watch movies with little violence.<br />Loved ET and Star War's movies.
B0085YNML2|3.0|downloaded and played fine on my kindle.<br />this game is cute in that the chameleon and his tongue catching are cute... but the game plays like so many others and is nothing really new - I have so many of these games already on my cloud of varying difficulties that I don't really need a new one unless it is very different and amusing.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|My case arrived as promised and in excellent condition. The clips fit neatly and securely on the Kindle without blocking the screen or access to power button.  No odd odors like some people have noted.  The non slip cover works great.  The case itself is very neat (makes it look like a nice leather bound book) and not overly bulky.  The case adds a little extra weight to the Kindle but not a problem for me personally.  The elastic strap is holding the cover securely.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great puzzle game, really gives the mind a fun workout! Even the frustration is a lot of fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't ever read for enjoyment so my girlfriend recommended I start by reading the Hunger Game Trilogy after we watched the movie & I bought my 1st Kindle. I Couldn't put it down! Right after I finished reading the 1st book I immediately wanted to start the next.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Loved this movie since I was a kid, glad Geffen finally got around to releasing the Director's Cut.  While this isn't a jam packed package, I'm still very pleased over all.  The featurettes aren't new, but for older material they actually contain some decent info for their short run time.  The gag reel is actually funny and contains a deleted scene or two as well.  The actual blu-ray case is a digibook with 35 pages of fluff and some nice pictures.  The teaser and trailer are also included.<br /><br />Now onto the real special feature of this release; the legendary Director's Cut with the EXTREMELY alternate ending.  **SPOILERS AHEAD**  The new cut features the original ending as written, that being that pretty much EVERYONE dies and the plant wins and takes over the world.  As I saw this as a child and have loved the film for years I really don't like the alternate ending, but the point is that it's here, and all the effects are finished and look amazing.  The model work is truly astounding as the plants take over the world!  I'll always prefer the theatrical cut, which is of course included, but it's nice to finally have the Director's Cut available.<br /><br />Overall this is a great package.  The video has a nice wash of grain without loosing any of the detail, and the songs sound great.  Recommended.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great story, Understand the different path then all previous versions.  Kirk gets his rear end handed to him way to much though. Hope next one in 2013 is as good.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|not a full version beware. they need to lable this correctly very miss leading and a bait and switch.  You don't even know how much the full version is until you agree to purchase it during the free trial version
0811876373|4.0|Loved these prouducts,although the cookbook...is a little diffucult! I LUVED IT! Recommend for anyone, fun to bake for the whole family, I am even starting a cake pop buisness!
B008KE3960|5.0|As a fan of tower defence games, this is a welcome diversion from the classic approach. The game is enjoyable without having to spend real cash.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I don't know how I missed this series, but I do know that this issue has the original uncut scenes and history of the actual home in Yorkshire used in filming, as extra film segments to the episodes. Just purchased this December 2012 - Excellent quality and no interruptions for viewing. Easily watch 2 episodes an evening as they about 45 - 50 minutes long. Magnificent acting and staging. Don't miss!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great great great . I wanted this when it was mega dollars on internet but i am glad i waited for it to be released, Awesome 3d graphics. So realistic. I love avatar
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This hidden object game is good, and long enough to be worth the price.  It has a variety of creative puzzles and find-the-differences games between h.o. scenes.  Not a game with an Inventory component.  Fun, for sure.
B006H5120E|5.0|This has amazing 3d graphics. Some of the scenes were just like you were in the movie . I love titantic anyways but this gives me one more reason to watch it over and over again.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This series is a great read. If you like fantasy you must read this set of books. Action and adventure throughout
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Really didnt care for it. I wouldnt say this one would be in my video colection. Graphics were ok but wasnt feeling the story line.
B00195ZM4O|1.0|It first I was real excited to find one still in near mint condition. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed when I opened the package. It was a fake!<br /><br />This record has been counterfeited by a third party. The cover had the cardboard jacket similar to the US version and not the glossy laminated style. Also the printing looked as if it came of a copier. I don't think the seller was aware but can't say for sure.<br /><br />In any event, I returned it for a full refund. Buyer beware.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Grest movie through amazon prime. THis was a great movie. Very touching. I would watch again. 5 Starr movie all the way.
B000PMG16U|4.0|I have ALL Star Wars versions - of course Lucas's later additions sucked, but once a Star Wars fan - always a Star Wars fan.<br /><br />The blu rays, as usual, are always about the aesthetics - stop thinking and just get it.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Ever since my father died I have been curious about where he went; what he experienced, and if he was alright.  His death hightened my sense of my own mortality.  I have read just about every book on the market and once I thought I had a grasp on the topic, a flurry of medical people injected serious doubt with their medical descriptions of what the brain might project that could be misconstruled as an NDE as it sufferes misfires brought about by medications or dreams that people who are very sick may experience. Eben Alexander is not only a doctor but a neurosurgeon whose professional knowledge and previous skeptism lends profound credence to what he experienced as authentic and highly probable and vendicates the reports of people who have experienced and wrote about it.  This topic has mystified me for over 30 years. and Eben Alexander III courage to tell his story has touched my heart.

B009B8YZIK|5.0|I've been a Halo fan for a decade now, first on the original Xbox and now on the 360. What has amazed me about the series is the depth of story that one doesn't often find in video games. This prequel to Halo 4 takes place before Halo Reach, and possibly before the war on Harvest (around the time of the Halo Wars game). More of the Halo history can be found on Halo Waypoint (Xbox Live).<br />The name of this story comes both from the ship that Chief and Cortana are stranded on at the end of Halo 3 as well as the poem (possibly an in-story author) written above the bunks of the Corbulo Academy of Military Sciences, where most of the story takes place. Most of the prequel is set to introduce Thomas Lasky, a cadet and later commander on the UNSC Ifininity (where he is a prominent character in the Halo 4 game and later the Infinity Sparten Ops episodes that come with the game), and his first encounter with both the Chief and Covenent. This story brings to life the Halo world as never before.

1439152802|2.0|The story is interesting, the concept strong but, my oh my, does this book go on!  All the gripping information that makes the characters' actions make so much sense, give you so much empathy for their respective plights, is buried beneath so much repetitive, waffling prose.  It took me over a week to read (I usually cover 3 books a week) and it was often laborious to continue.  I was engaged enough in the characters to stick with it & find out the mystery Laurel is trying to solve, but this could have been told in 1/3 of the size with 3x the pace and plausibility.  There are not many authors that can brilliantly do the back & forth narrative (A S Byatt in 'Possession', Thomas Keneally in the brilliant 'Bettany's Book').  Kate Morton is not one of them.  If you want an epic read for the holidays, those mentioned & several others besides are a better bet.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Channing Tatum & the guys do a terrific job of having fun with this film. A bit on the cheesy side but all in all it's a lot of fun music!!!!
1932735410|5.0|I passed the PMP Exam on my first attempt with the mandated instructor led training and about 30 hours of self-study using this book.  The 30 hours of self-study included reading the entire book once (I did a few of the practice tests and exercises but not all of them like the book recommends), I then went back and took the practice tests and reviewed my weak areas.  After taking the exam I would recommend spending more time on the exercises, especially cost and time estimation techniques and earned value management calculations.<br />I read the reviews on this book before buying it.  Some reviewers said that they didn't like Rita's style implying that she is condecending in tone.  I agree with that assessment but I think that tone was used for a reason and is extremely effective in preparing the reader for the exam.  The reader needs to understand that PMI's concept of a Project Manager is of a person with unmatched skills in all PM processes, high levels of confidence and competence, and the ability to make the right decisions in all situations.  Rita's condecending tone helps to get the exam candidate into the proper midset before taking the exam.<br />One note on the Amazon reviews...I did notice when reading the reviews for several different books that a reviewer was posting the same review for different books.  This negative (1 Star) review is probably an advertising ploy and should be ignored.<br />I don't have any negative comments on this book (especially since I passed the exam)and I will be recommending this book to anyone who asks for my recommendations.  Good luck!

B0068TL23G|5.0|I've been playing this game on and off for months and love the challenge. It starts off easy and increases in difficulty. I did have problems though when I got up to chapter 16 where the connection lights would not track with my stylus. I uninstalled it and found a free one from the same maker and played that until I reached the point where you have to purchase the game to advance. I deleted that one and reinstalled the original that I had problems with. It worked again, however I lost all my accomplishments. Even so I gave this a 5 star because it remains fun and challenging in spite of the problem.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well, I bought this book thinking that it should last me awhile since I don't have much time for fun reading (Masters student). Turns out that I could barely put down the book that I thought I would be reading into my winter break. It made for some very sleepy mornings, but so totally worth it. I am encouraging my family to read it next.<br />My final thoughts? I am completely stoked to see two more of the books are out! I hope that Mr. Howey keeps up the good work! He has a new fan :-)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|To say that I loved this book would be a gross understatement. I LOVED THIS BOOK. It was awesome. If you are into late 20th century pop culture, recite Monty Python and Ghostbusters lines in the course of daily life, sometimes without realizing it, played and loved video games in the 80s, and/or consider yourself in anyway a nerd, this book is for you. This is a story set in the not too distant dystopian future about a young man who spends the majority of his life in what started out at an MMORPG and has evolved into an integrated part of everyone's life on the planet. In the future, not only nerds play. It's a fun adventure, and will not disappoint.

1439152802|4.0|The time is 1961. A family is celebrating the second birthday of their youngest child. Laurel is the eldest of the five children. She is hiding from everyone, daydreaming in her tree house, when suddenly, she witnesses a terrible act of violence involving her mother.<br />The story then shoots forward into the future, to 2011, 50 years hence. Laurel has arrived back in her home town to visit with her ailing mother, Dorothy.<br />As Laurel's mother becomes more and more frail, Laurel becomes preoccupied with investigating the tragic incident she witnessed from the tree house, as a teenager. She wants to discover the truth about why it happened because she believes that there is a hidden secret behind the incident. As she investigates her mother's past, it is sometimes hard to tell if Laurel is the one actually discovering the hidden secrets or if they are simply being revealed to the reader, alone, by another character, almost as if the reader is a voyeur, separate and apart from Laurel. Because of this, as the story moves back and forth in time, basically telling the story of three major characters, Dorothy, Vivien and Jimmy, it can feel a bit disorienting.<br />There is a lot of misdirection as the secrets are exposed, concerning the character's purposes and personalities. This often makes it hard to anticipate what is going to happen next. While this arouses the reader's curiosity, it also sometimes becomes a little tedious, and the reader might feel inclined to put the book down to take a break from it. However, just when you think you might give up, there is a new twist or turn introduced which excites your interest even more and rapidly draws you back to the pages.<br />The past is revealed, bit by bit, but sometimes the eureka moments meander through time, in what seems to be a haphazard way, but in the end they all fall into place. The author has written a wonderful story about the trials of family, love and friendship coupled with a murder mystery all rolledinto one.<br />Be forewarned! The ending is completely unexpected and is a total surprise; so don't peek. It will ruin your experience completely if you do. Nothing and no one is as they seem. Wait for the author to reveal it all on the road she plots for you to travel. You won't be disappointed.<br />My biggest criticism of this book is one I have for many others, of late. The age of computers has made it almost too  easy for authors to produce novels. For some reason, this has also inspired the creation of tomes. They seem to be twice as long, often, as they need to be, and therefore, they sometimes seem too wordy and too bogged down in unnecessary detail.

B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I was impressed with Phillip Phillips on American Idol but am even more impressed with this album.  It's a bit \\"poppier\\" than I expected, but I cut him some slack, since he's been writing and performing for only a few years and recorded the album in three weeks.  I like all the cuts: special favorites are \\"Man on the Moon,\\" \\"Gone, Gone, Gone,\\" \\"Get Up Get Down,\\" \\"Wanted Is Love,\\" and \\"Can't Go Wrong.\\"  I predict that he'll continue to grow and have a long, solid career in the Alternative Rock arena, atypically for American Idol winners.
0061726834|4.0|Lena Haloway is less than six months away from getting the procedure known as `The cure'. In a world that is surrounded by the all-knowing government, people receive the cure as soon as they are eighteen. Love is a disease that makes one crazy, dangerous and out of control. Everyone is fearful of catching `deliria'. Her mother committed suicide because of it; her sister nearly suffered the same fate. Lena is determined to stay in line, receive her cure with accompanying marks and be paired for immediate marriage after college graduation. It's just as life is supposed to be.<br /><br />It's during her evaluation that something changes in Lena. Unable to vocalise her practiced answer, she nearly loses everything, but an unforeseen distraction causes her test to be invalid. It's also when she meets Alex: a nineteen-year-old boy that bares the mark. He's cured, providing Lena with a security blanket for their friendship. If he wasn't, she could be hauled away to the Crypts for being seen with him. Being too busy following all the rules, there's to more to Lena's world that she's never noticed. As the bubbles of her life gradually pop, she's going to have to make a choice: To love, or to die.<br /><br />I have to be honest, I much preferred Delirium to Oliver's Before I Fall. Lena is an excellent example of how effective brainwashing can be. I see this book as a spooky foretelling of America's future. Living in a country that's known for its `Big Brother', I found myself wondering how far is too far for a society to be looked at?  I can't imagine a world without free speech or the freedom to love whomever you want. And yet, there are many passages where this easily could have taken place in a modern day America.<br /><br />This is a story about growing up, falling in love and discovering what is important in life. People are different; a large population cannot conform to one simple ideal. History has proven this and Delirium takes advantage of human nature the right way. What would the world be like if we weren't allowed to love? What would happen to a society if they found a way to love again? A fast paced read with a love story of Romeo and Juliet, I'm really hoping my local library will have the second book available! (Just checked - it's a disappointing no.)<br /><br />Many thanks to the publisher Hodder & Stoughton for sending me two copies from their social media campaign!

0307887448|5.0|This novel isn't for everyone, that should be said right up front.  One needs at least a cursory interest in nostalgic video games and science  fiction television and movies to be able to understand a lot of what's going on.  Note that I didn't say cursory \\"knowledge\\", just interest.  If you have that you'll be just fine, and you'll enjoy a terrific novel.<br /><br />Ready Player One takes place mostly in OASIS, a virtual reality simulator that has essentially taken over the planet Earth in the mid 21st century.  The real Earth is devastated by a series of energy wars and racked with pollution.  It's not quite post-apocalyptic, but it's on the road to it.  OASIS is an escape, a World of Warcraft times a million, designed by reclusive James Halliday and playing it (the basic components are given away at schools) is often the only joy, or human interaction, that millions of people have.  Then the game changes, as Halliday dies, and leaves his quarter trillion dollar fortune to the one person that can crack, through a series of arcane clues, his ultimate player challenge.  It's a challenge that enraptures hundreds of millions of OASIS players.<br /><br />Wade Watts is our first person narrating protagonist, he's 18 and dirt poor, living in Oklahoma.  His real life has little hope, but his virtual life is not half bad.  He's a good student, going to a high school within the OASIS system, but his home life is marginal and he has no idea about his future.....until he cracks the first clue in Halliday's challenge.  It took him five years, and tons of research into Halliday and his \\"geek\\" interests, but he's the first.  His life changes, both for the good and bad, and old  friendships (all virtual) change and new alliances (the same) emerge.  He's on the road to getting the prize, but of course it won't be quite so easy.<br /><br />Wade, avatar name Parzival, is an interesting hero, in that so much of his knowledge about life is formed by old movies and television shows.  So if he seems on page like an amalgamation of various heroes from those media.......well it makes sense, given the context in which he resides.  His attempts at romance with fellow player Art3mis (no, I didn't spell that incorrectly) are amusing, though they smack of being the first subplot to be 'off', as you would think that anyone as online savvy as Wade would have done his share of flirting before.  His other main friendship, with the mysterious Aech (pronounced 'H'), is well done too.<br /><br />What's wrong?  Well besides the villain being a little too cartoonish (the evil corporation IOI and their hissable CEO Nolan Sorrento), very little.  I guess one itch I have would be that it's a bit short, I think 100 extra pages to flesh things out would have improved the narrative, both in terms of added exposition and some more character moments.<br /><br />But Ernest Cline delivered a fantastic debut novel, one that flows easily and is a great trip down nostalgia lane for this 40 year old.  Great read, highly recommended.<br /><br />Five Stars.

0446554995|3.0|\\"Terrific -- not exquisite\\" --<br /><br />Like any addiction, the original ecstasy never returns. That is to say honeymoons end. I came late to the series, starting only this year with Still Life with Crows, and I followed it with everything up and until the long wait for Two Graves. Each book subsequent to Still Life was slightly a let down -- none brought me back to the peak of nirvana of the first. This is not to say that the others were poor or unreadable or unrecommendable; only that I could not regain the effects of Still Life.<br /><br />Waiting (6 mos) for Two Graves, I was eager to start reading. The first half was stellar. The third quarter good; the final quarter long, tedious and unjustified.<br /><br />At first I felt manipulated that three discrete story lines were being offered alternatively. but at the end, we were given pages and of Pendergast's show-down in South America. Frankly, I got bored.<br /><br />The three story lines are treated inequitably. Corrie Swanson returns to this episode, and she has a lot of \\"stuff\\" to take care of. She, her problems and her conflict are introduced, her conflict is resolved... that's it.<br /><br />Constance's story is examined again, a conflict intervenes and is resolved. But these two very interesting parallel story lines are abruptly abandoned so that we can follow AXP playing superhero. Each of the other two stories resolve independent of the main one, but AXP does not contribute to their resolution. This makes me feel cheated of my proper fix of AXP's masterful management of all that is wrong in the world.<br /><br />For me, and I offered my limited P&C credentials above, AXP drives everything, and in this book, he was off on his own adventures, eschewing help from D'Agosto and Corrie, which would have made the solving much more \\"real\\" in the context of these books.<br /><br />As for the story(ies):<br /><br />1. The Constance story resolves in this book. The explanation is more than a little implausible, but it fits comfortably with the explanation of Helen's disappearance in the earlier books.<br /><br />2. Corrie gets to play detective all by herself. She is successful and finds her long-sought happiness. Corrie bears a remarkable resemblance (in behavior, attitude, goals and gall) to Lisbeth Salandar from the Dragon Tattoo Series. P&G's Corrie was created in 2003, well before Larson's books (2011) which is telling!<br /><br />3. The AXP/Helen/South America story could have been half as long and the above two expanded more deeply. Lots of traveling, planning, reconnoitering, faking and infiltrating taking up many, many pages, and in my opinion wasting good story time.<br /><br />4. Thrown in for good measure is some progress in D'Agosto's life.<br /><br />again... nothing interactive among all the beloved characters. It's like three different books (novellas) packaged as one big novel.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to a new P&C reader, but for a fan, Two Graves is a MUST read. Some of the early parts are classic P&C.<br /><br />I have faith the next installments will be 100% wonderful again.t it fits comfortably with the explanation of Helen's disappearance in the earlier books.<br /><br />2.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|Received my copy of alien anthology today,haven't watched any movies yet,but want to comment on the new book type packaging.This is the best packaging I have seen(excluding ultimate edition boxed sets) of any blu ray discs.The outer slip cover is very sturdy,and the book pages are 2mm thick cardboard.The only fault with this set is the book containing the discs fits too tight( top to.bottom) and hence wears the gloss colored edging off both ends - back to white cardboard after only 2 or 3 removals. Very disappointing.
034580404X|4.0|The writing style is raw and untutored. The story is riveting. Christian Grey is a damaged soul wrapped in a sophisticated package of magnetic sexuality and power. But within is a gentle loving man that only Anastasia Steel sees. Her innocence and complete trust in him lets him drop barriers held in place his whole life. As he slowly lets Ana in she finds him all the more compelling for these flaws and weaknesses. Her love and simple faith in him makes him strive to be a better man because he thinks she deserves the best man that he can be. Put simply he's addicted to Ana, sex, and control in that order but he doesn't realize this until she leaves him and his world falls apart. It's a beautiful love story. One woman, one man, one love, and the life that they are learning to build together.

B003L7DK6U|5.0|The main reason why I purchased this Blu-ray version of this film was because it contains the English audio track which the [[ASIN:B0049SB3ZU Bruce Lee Legendary Collection Blu-ray Boxed Set (Region A) (Ntsc)]] version does not. With that said HD video quality is fairly good for such an old movie. 5.1 Dolby Digial audio is good but does not use lossless encoding like some of the other films in the boxed set. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase. It's a classic being Bruce Lee's last film and one of the more familiar to US audiences. I enjoyed the intro boat scene which was shot in Hong Kong and gives viewers a small glimpse into Chinese culture.
1594744769|2.0|Some juvenile fiction writers can deliver an experience that is also enjoyable for adults, for example, J.K. Rowling. Alas, Random Riggs is not such an author. The story was cute albeit disturbing at times, but the characters were not well developed, and the characters all act like kids and make decisions like teenagers with poor impulse control, when given the nature of the story, they should not be written in that manner.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing story....I get lost in Gideon and Eva's relationship. Even with having an idea of what was about to happen I couldn't stop turning the pages! Loved it and seriously looking forward to their continued  story.
B000K4WLXA|4.0|The disc played perfectly, and all items were included in the box. My one small complaint is that I wanted this for a collectors item, but it appears as though something heavy sat on top of the box as there are some wrinkles in the case.  So I decided to open this one, and I'll buy a new one later, hopefully it will be better.

B009S8PEHY|4.0|This is a pleasant album. Most Christmas albums sound last minute and thrown together but the song selection and production indicates time and effort was made on this album.<br /><br />For those complaining about this being another \\"cover\\" album, the overwhelming majority of Christmas albums have used the same Christmas songs over and over again for the past 50 years. The same two or three songs appears on virtually Christmas album released.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app for everything. From trying new recipes to crafts to places I want to visit. Instead of saving so many different pages its nice to have everything in one place. I use pinterest multiple times a day and am never disappointed. I love the addition of secret boards as well.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|My ONLY gripe is that the outer sleeve came with the shipping label/receipt semi-attached to it. When I went to remove it, the super strong adhesive left an awful residue. I mean, its on the back but it still kinda sucks. In time that sticky spot will turn black with all the dirt and stuff that gets attached to it. In any event, the product came VERY fast and the disc was not damaged.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a wonderful book! Each moment was more beautiful and magical than the last. Erin Morgenstern's beautiful descriptions create an enchanted masterpiece filled characters so intriguing you'll wish the story will never end.

0425263908|5.0|Better than 50 shades of gray. Not that thats not a good book too! This one is more appealing, it draws you in but never give to much away that you can say oh I got it figured out! If 50 was to kinky for you this could be more your style.
0399157565|1.0|What can I say, the book is all page fillers, no story. It takes forever to get to the story and again forever to make progress. Unnecessary details are explained in excruciating detail, details that don't matter to the story. It's one thing to paint as picture, another to bore the reader to death.<br /><br />Total failure at story telling. Disappointed.

B0059XTU22|5.0|\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Bilbo Baggins, who is swept into an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome Dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the Wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of 13 Dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild, through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins, Orcs and deadly Wargs, as well as a mysterious and sinister figure known only as the Necromancer.<br /><br />Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain, first they must escape the Goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever...Gollum.<br /><br />Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of ingenuity and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's \\"precious\\" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities...A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.<br /><br />The cast led by Ian McKellen (as Gandalf) & Martin Freeman (as Bilbo Baggins) is great. The directing by Peter Jackson (also wrote the screenplay & produced) is great. The screenplay (based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien) by Jackson, Fran Walsh (also produced), Philippa Boyens (also produced) & Guillermo del Toro is great.<br /><br />The music by Howard Shore is great. The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie is great. The film editing by Jabez Olssen is great. The casting by Victoria Burrows, Amy Hubbard, John Hubbard, Liz Mullane & Miranda Rivers is great. The production design by Dan Hennah is great. The art direction by Simon Bright, Andy McLaren & Ben Milsom is great. The set decoration by Ra Vincent, set designs by Isadore William Crooks, Jenny Hitchcock, John Lott, Mark Stephen & Gavin Urquhart, set dressings by Colin Elms, Rosie Guthrie &Gillian West-Walker is great. The costume design by Bob Buck, Ann Maskrey & Richard Taylor is great. The prosthetic make-up effects supervised by Tami Lane is great. The special effects coordinated by Phil McLaren & Paul Verrall is great. The visual effects supervised by Matt Aitken, Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon, Kevin Andrew Smith & R. Christopher White is great. The stunts coordinated by Tim Wong (also coordinated the fights), Desiree Rose Cheer, Augie Davis, James O'Donnell & Paul Shapcott is great.<br /><br />This is a great and well-made film that is just about in line with the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" trilogy. Peter Jackson has made another great film that is visually entertaining and interesting. Martin Freeman does an interesting job as Bilbo Baggins. This is one of the best movies of the holiday season.

160309007X|5.0|Many fans of this series will at first react poorly to this story, I know I did, but that reaction is wrong. I will explain why. This concluding episode of the \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Century\\" is far more brilliant than it at first appears. It is a secret message, an encoded scream of horror and a tragedy that mirrors Lear. Read it first before continuing here.<br /><br />I had eagerly anticipated 2009 after reading 1969, as I'm sure have many others. In the first two volumes of Century Moore had very subtly begun a commentary on the decline of Western Civilization and even more subtly on the possibility of mankind achieving immortality in the near future. In many of the interviews he does Moore often claims to be completely detached from modern life, but don't believe it. In an interview he did with wired.com in 2011 Moore mentions that human beings could soon live much, much longer than they currently do and I believe this is the genesis of the Quartermain/Murray/Orlando immortality storyline - he's writing about the predictions of people like Ray Kurzweil and other futurists who believe mankind is on the cusp of living forever. He's also writing about his own long experience of living with two women, his first wife and their lover.<br /><br />With those elements in mind, I found the disintegration of the Quartermain Murray relationship via their permanent threesome with Orlando to be especially poignant. Quartermain is hopelessly lost without Mina, even though he'd had difficulty living with her at the end. We leave him in a heroin stupor in a basement punk rock club, pissing himself, broken. I was looking forward to some kind of resurgence of Quartermain as a hero, redeemed by his love for Mina. Moore gives us something much more complex instead.<br /><br />The main protagonist of 2009 is not a redeemed Quartermain but instead Orlando the decidedly un-heroic 3,000 year-old hermaphrodite. Orlando doesn't even seem to care much about saving the world, and his listlessness infects the reader almost from the first page, but along with that apathy there is also a frenzied despair that has crept into the character, he slaughters his military unit in Iraq, returns to London (the city he founded), begins to menstruate and collapses into the shower in tears. Orlando carries a great burden in this story, he represents all of Western Civilization going back to Homer, as he reminds us he fought at Troy, and he has quite a bit less fight in him now than the Napoleonic era fighter he runs into at the open of the story.<br /><br />Orlando, a woman now, is tasked by Prospero to find Mina and Quartermain and fight the anti-Christ. She goes through the motions. She enlists the aide of M16, also a woman now, to find Mina. She runs into Alan, now a homeless drug addict, but she can't inspire him to help her. He doesn't \\"do all that stuff anymore.\\" This is a commentary on the \\"End of Man\\" as in the end of males/masculinity at the start of the 21st century. Quartermain had represented the stalwart heroic values of 19th Century Great Britain, however flawed; he pulled himself out of an opium den once to save Mina, but he won't do it this time; he's done with all that. Now some of you may pull back from my interpretation here and say I'm reading too much into the story, but I'm not and I'll make my point shortly.<br /><br />Orlando rescues Mina from an insane asylum, where she's been drugged into incoherence for 40 years. Once off the drugs Mina recovers fairly quickly and they together resume the case of fighting off the apocalypse, although Mina was told by the Prisoner of London that by the time they discover the anti-Christ in 2009 it will be too late. They both try to get Quartermain to come with them, but he won't. There is an emotional exchange between Quartermaine and Mina, Orlando doesn't even get involved, but she can't sway him. He says he's sorry for going to the drugs, but also blames her for not being there for him. He says it was all the adventuring that ruined them, but it's hard to believe that. I think the rupture between them and Mina's incarceration since 1969 is meant to represent the fundamental change in the relationship between men and women in the Western world since the 60s, whatever redeeming influence women might have once had over men it's been lost with their equality with men. That's a controversial thing to say, but I think that's what Moore is saying with this fiction.<br /><br />Orlando and Mina go on without Quartermain and discover the anti-Christ is a pistache of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. This will probably be the most talked about bit from 2009 but I don't think it's the most interesting. After they realize what they are facing they report back to Prospero, and give themselves one night to rest and more importantly to have sex before facing the end of the world.<br /><br />This is important because when Orlando and Mina do battle with the Harry Potter/anti-christ they do so as lesbians, man is not in this fight. During the course of the fight Quartermain does manage to restrain himself from suicide long enough to show up and prolong the fight, not exactly saving Mina and Orlando but helping them out a bit. He is then killed by a lightingbolt from Harry's penis.<br /><br />This all feels absolutely horrible to any reader who cared about the relationship between Mina and Alan, but it's all symbolic of the fall of men and the rise of women and the death of Western Civilization - it's what the story is about. This episode references King Lear and the abruptness of the tragedy here feels very much like the 5th Act of King Lear, where all hope of reconciliation is lost.  The undead skull of Oliver Hado comments as much when he tells Mina and Orlando that they haven't prevented the apocalypse, they've merely stolen it from him. Mary Poppins also shows up and takes out Anti-christ Harry. So it's all women here at the end, even M16 and her girlfriends who show up and transport the remaining ladies to the immortality pool. This isn't a condemnation of lesbianism but it is a simple statement about how Western Civilation's relationship between men and woman has now irrevocably collapsed and women together cannot produce a child sexually, which is a kind of a apocalypse. Mina reinforces these notions in the closing pages when she comments that as bad a flirt as Orlando is as a woman she's worse as a man, men aren't going to make it, not even in the League of Extraordinary GENTLEMEN, but women will live on.<br /><br />With all of that said, Moore has said there will be another chapter in the story of the League and it will take place only a few years later, possibly 2010-11. So I'm hoping fans will give this story a deeper look and consider the themes I've talked about in this review. Moore has really tapped into something with these stories, he's almost predicting the future in a way that's he's not getting credit for because I don't think many people understand what he's writing about. This graphic novel is attempting to write about the death of the civilization that birthed the fictions from which it was created. And it presents a dark vision of the present. I had more than a few goosebumps over the scene that references \\"school shootings\\" in the U.S., given the events of Friday. A brilliant, brilliant piece of fiction that should be read by everyone.

0307266303|3.0|McDougall undoubtedly knows somewhat about long-distance runnning, and tells a fascinating story.  He also offers summations of research people have done on running as done by people and animals, and what it reveals about the strengths and weaknesses of different sorts of runners.<br /><br />The flaw I see is that McDougall tends toward hyberbole, and the colorful, a tendency that often makes one look at his assertions with a rather jaundiced eye.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I received this for 17 dollars, which is awesome, because this comes with a booklet, a shiny box cover, all 3 dvds in order, the booklet alone is worth it, and is in color. Which is rare nowadays because I am sick of those grey dvds that every movie is now.<br /><br />As I am writing this review, the price is 27 something. I am not sure you want to buy this, but I guess it is worth it. I am just so happy I got it for 17!<br /><br />There are no special features or anything, just the dvds. But wow, what a perfect gift.
B00003CX5P|2.0|In my feedback i simply stated that the item i order was a bit pricey which it was however i still purchased the item cause i thought it was worth it well after posting my feedback i got a very rude email from the seller in which point he said not to buy from him again so if you like rude sellers then i guess this is the guy to buy from but personally im a nice person And i would expect the same after all i did buy from them thanks

B0049P1VHS|5.0|There isn't enough time for me to tell you how awesome The Walking Dead is. This is not just a Zombie show, it is a study on the human condition in a crisis. The Zombies are just the danger, this show is very much about a group of survivors trying to survive a cataclysmic event and maintain their humanity. While only 6 episodes, Season one will have you gripping the edge of your seat the entire time. Be forewarned, you will not survive buying this season without being compelled to buy the second and soon to be third seasons. Awesome Show.
1451627297|3.0|This novel holds an all time record for me, three weeks to read. Loved the first 100 pages and the last 200 pages. The 547 in the middle took me quite a while. If you're a die-hard fan like me you will have to read it, if you're new to King, read the others first they're better. Still, my all time favorite author.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|this movie was so upsetting! Witchcraft, grown men showing their naked behinds,and a little girl calling her Mom a BEAST!  How dare they make such a cartoon and let children watch it.  Children are so impressionable and they shouldn't create such movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just stopping in to put my five stars into the pot. I couldn't help comparing this novel to King's The Long Walk, in which I liked better. But, I still need to give credit where credit is due. Very emotional story.

1118156307|4.0|My reason for reviewing and rating this book, is mainly a result of its concluding sections.This book demonstrates that service design is a practice and philosophy that will have far reaching implications for how humans might approach life in future. Touching on biophilia, the authors beg the question of whether service design, might not only have implications for ecological design but also whether service design could also be applied to human ecological system services to other species. This is not the topic of the book but potentially it is were service design thinking could lead us.

B0016492BW|5.0|The transfer was very well done, it was of a higher definition than the DVD, especially the sound quality. If you don't have a DVD of this, definitely get this. If you do have the DVD, you'd still be better off considering to get this than refusing all together.

B000002JPA|5.0|Images and Words is my favorite Dream Theater album. In my opinion, it's the best combination of musicians in the bands history. The musicianship is incredible. The mix of the neo-classical, progressive rock, and catchy hooks is prefect. This is also one of my favorite all time records, not to mention the best Dream Theater record. I think that fans of most any style of music can find something to love here.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|this doll was great I KNow without a doubt that my granddaughter will love it. she loves monster high so much
B000002JKA|5.0|Awake is a great album. It is a lot different from any of the other albums that the band has put out. The main differences that strike me are the tone that Labrie uses, and the heavily dominant percussion section on many of the songs. My favorite songs on this one are Innocence Faded, Erotomania, and Lifting Shadows Off A Dream. Though not songs that you would call \\"staples\\", these are very unique and memorable songs for me. This album is a must have for any Dream Theater fan, or fan of the progressive rock genre.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have a kindle fire works great and i make my friends jelous that i have it on there i love this game it is for creative or not creative people.
B000006YCU|4.0|I was in progressive rock bands in my teens and early 20's. I am amazed that these guys were able to make music like this in that time of their lives. It is a testament to their awesome talent, and a portent of even better things to come. This album features Petrucci, Myung, Portnoy, Moore, and Dominici. While this record is very good, it's not one of the better albums. It has a very Rush, Queensryche, and Journey vibe to it. While I like Rush and Queensryche; Journey has always been painful for me to listen to. This album seems to have a lot of that influence in it. The lead singer is okay. James Labrie is much better though. Still, I think that this album is very good, and a must have for Dream Theater fans, or fans of prog rock in general.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I have used this for several days and have probably downloaded over 20 videos (some an hour long, some 3 minutes) on a kindle fire 7\\" hd, with zero problems, none at all.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|It has been 8 years since Batman took the fall for the death of Harvey Dent. Since then, Batman has been absent, Bruce Wayne has been hold up in his home, and things have been relatively peaceful in Gotham City. That is until a mercenary called Bane shows up and starts causing trouble. He begins by stealing Bruce's fingerprints and bankrupting him. Apparently he knows his secret. He then steals a nuclear fusion reactor core, cut Gotham off from the world and lets chaos run rampant. Batman was no match for Bane, and he has been thrown into a prison in a far away land. To save Gotham, Bruce must escape from the prison, dispose of the nuclear bomb, defeat Bane and come to terms with his own insecurities. He isn't alone. There is a clever girl named Selena Kyle, that will put on a mask and fight with Batman to save the city.<br /><br />This is a great sequel. All of the actors do a great job. There is considerably less action in this movie than the previous 2. Much of this film is focused on Bruce Wayne's depression, despair, and fragile mental state. Bane is a great villain, but Catwoman isn't very cat-like, and seemed a bit superfluous in the story. Despite these differences, This movie is very entertaining and a worthy sequel in the Dark Knight franchise. I think that if you liked the 1st 2 movies, you will like this one.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|This presentation is nice enough to follow the standard formula. However people that like this formula won't be disappointed. Nerds in space with robots that look like people and aliens that look like...um...aliens.<br /><br />Charlize Theron looks cute in her skin tight black suit. But the real focus is on Michael Fassbender as David the unknown quantity.<br /><br />Just do not expect this movie to tie up everything in a pink ribbon as it looks like it was designed to be the beginning of a series or maybe the prequel to that their \\"Alien\\" series.
1603890238|2.0|This &#34;pamphlet&#34; was a major disappointment.  Save your money.  A &#34;Cliff's Notes&#34; would be more informative.  I feel ripped off.
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|This would perhaps be more accurately be described as \\"music from the motion picture\\" to give buyers a bit of a warning that it isn't really the \\"soundtrack\\". The a capella songs are studio versions - cleanly performed and with smaller ensembles. The \\"riff-off\\" and \\"Since U Been Gone\\" tracks suffer the most, in my opinion. Although one could argue that, without the context of the film, these mistake-free versions make for better listening, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Another significant omission is the lack of any of the main character's remixes other than the final a capella performance. Despite the fact that the entire plot revolves around Beca skillfully and creatively remixing popular songs, none of these are included. While I would like to hold out hope that a second album may be created featuring these mixes, I think it's more likely that rights issues and/or costs prevented their inclusion.<br /><br />The music that IS included on this album is good otherwise. I particularly enjoyed the longer version of \\"Cups\\". As a fan of the film and the music, it was worth the price (~$9).
B00913P6G0|5.0|This album made me want to buy music again and it was just a breath of fresh of air to hear real hip hop again
B008HJGPVO|5.0|The Amazon Basics Multi-tip Stylus is a simple, handy little device. It has 3 identical tips- one on each end, and one on the cap. The tips have just the right springy, spongy feel to safely tap on my iPad. While I wouldn't use it much for typing long emails or blog posts, it's great for websurfing and games, especially my current favorite, Simpsons Tapped Out. Just using the stylus on that game alone dramatically reduces the smudges and smears on my screen. The clip attaches to my iPad case easily (might not be the true for all covers), so it doesn't get lost when I move from room to room.
B00000IZOR|2.0|Not only is it smaller than the original, the string holding the receiver to the phone is about 8&#34; so it's virtually I,possible to hold it to your ear. Plus the string to pull I had to put a<br />Large button on to pull as it kept falling between my grandsons fingers

B009NTNHJU|5.0|I'm the type of person who buys lots of artists albums and see if I like it and I gotta say Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded The Re-Up is by far the BEST Album I ever bought! Im so happy with my purchase. Everyone who doesn't like Nicki Minaj or thinks shes not good enough really needs to listen to this cause this album PROVES that Nicki Minaj is the queen of Hip-Hop weather you like it or not. So with that being said, I defiantly recommend this album to everyone, even if you're not a big fan of her, this is a must buy!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down it brought tears to my eyes. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read.

B0000VCZKW|5.0|We just love Matilda, she is sweet and funny.  We have watched this movie more times than I can count.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My wife and I picked this up at the Lego store at Downtown Disneyland (an awesome store).<br /><br />We're great VW camper van fans - own a Eurovan from the last US production year.<br /><br />This was by far the most complicated Lego assembly I've embarked on. The 100+ page instructions were detailed enough to produce the expected result.  You're going to want about a dozen (or more) containers to separate the 1322 parts (plus a few extras)<br /><br />We enjoyed assembling this and it has a prominent position in our home décor.
0345803493|5.0|This one of the 3 was, by far, the best in the trilogy.  I lost a lot of sleep staying up later then I should have just because I couldn't put the book down!

0553386794|3.0|This rating was made because this is a very long story and is somewhat boring in sections.  Will pass on any sequel.
0345803485|5.0|It was different than anything I ever read before, that's for sure.  I was hooked and had to get the other 2!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|You can`t go wrong if you buy this on discount, awesome packaging, the only flaw would be the bad support for the discs, it may end scratching the media if you`re not careful enough.
0439023521|5.0|I bought 2 copies of this book so my niece and I could read it together before we went to see the movie.  It was great, the story and sharing the reading experience with my niece!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I played this game all the way through on my new kindle 8.9.  As usual, I play casual or untimed mode, so I cannot comment on the timed mode. This is a great game, just the right mix. It stayed interesting all the way through. I didn't have trouble seeing anything but that might have something to do with the larger screen and HD. Thank you for the enjoyment without any frustration or irritation. Nancy Bettac Barton, grammacozy62
0345803507|4.0|I really like this trilogy but would have to say this story was my least favorite of the 3.  I thought the &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending was a let down.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a wonderful album... I absolutely love the Piano Guys.  If you haven't listened to them yet - you're missing out!
B002LLE3PY|4.0|The artists involved in this album felt like it was kind of a jumbled up mix of songs with out a thread of continuity. So what. Many albums are. As such this is a fine album with musicians playing at tehir peak and experimenting in ways that few other musicians were. The tunes stay with you in a very haunting manner. I had not heard this album since I was a teenager, since I no longer play albums. Then I heard &#34;indoor games&#34; on Pandora and said &#34;Oh yeah, that was a great song&#34;. I realized then  I had to get the CD, and found that I like it even more now than I did then. Flutes, saxophones, and guitars played by virtuosos. Jon Anderson from Yes guest sings. Then you throw the DVD in as an added bonus and the offer was way too good to pass up.  Hard to believe it has been 45 years. Hope to still be listening to this 45 years from now.
B00005V1WO|1.0|Since seeing THE DEVILS, I've understood that with Ken Russell, you always get a high degree of cinematic bravura mixed with a hefty dose of almost childish self-indulence. If ever a film director needed a good editor, it's Russell. But in GOTHIC, we only get the self-indulgence. Though I'm genuinely interested in the film's subject matter, I had to constantly suppress the urge to fast-forward. To borrow the line once used about Poulenc, Ken Russell had absolutely nothing to say about this subject...and he said it. [The film HAUNTED SUMMER covers the same territory with more intelligence, but it has it's weaknesses too. The relationships depicted in this film cry out for a serious film treatment, but it will take an awfully good screenwriter to liberate them from their literary roots.]
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|This movie did not hold my interest...after the 90 minute mark, it became almost painful.  Cat woman was cool though.

B00A7CI82I|2.0|This movie was nothing more than a bad copy of the original series.  The action was dull and the drama and mystery surrounding the main character was absent.  They didn't even try to maintain any level of intrigue; they laid it all out for you each step of the way.  What made the original series so good was the fact that you were following Jason Bourne on an intense journey to find out who he really was.  Nothing about this movie seemed original and it completely lacked any intensity. I was bored by the time the big cookie cutter chase scene occurred.  If the movie were titled anything else I would probably give it 3 stars since it was watchable but it just didn't live up to the legacy of Bourne.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Ive seen that movie once and loved it. Im thankful someone had it for me to buy. I of course rate the person sending it to me 5 stars the movie is beyond 5 stars.
B004478AS4|1.0|Terribly boring and lots of strings left untied at the end. Very quick plot progression leads to not enough characterization or climax.

B004PGO25O|5.0|This is absolutely a great read on the fire.  The way the book reads with the changing fonts and placement of it - it comes off as vibrant as the content itself.<br /><br />As far as the book goes - anybody who is serious about their creative work should read this.

B0041KVW2K|2.0|Like so many others I was disappointed with the quality of these discs. The surface noise is too much for new discs, and on some tracks is a total distraction to being able to enjoy the music. A few tracks also have the horrible noise/distortion caused by non-fill. No point in commenting on the music here as it is the manufacturing that is at fault. Overall these pressings would be substandard for any vinyl rerelease, let alone the Beatles.<br /><br />equipment used: Rega Planar 3 turntable, Grace 707 tonearm, A & R P77 cartridge
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This movie should be revered as a classic. Beautifully presented, wonderfully animated, great moments of both action and serenity, I believe that it is unfair that \\"The Polar Express\\" isn't already mentioned in the same breath as \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" and \\"A Christmas Story.\\" It certainly is in the top five of all Christmas movies, if not the top 10, with a meaningful-yet-succinct storyline and fantastic acting by the entire cast (Tom Hanks in particular, of course).<br /><br />Probably the best children's movie in the last 25 years; certainly the best Christmas movie in that span.
B004S699LI|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie on DVD and was anxious to see it on Blu-ray. The transfer quality was great. There was no flaws in the transfer like I<br />had with the Hostel Blu-ray I bought. The clarity was great and I enjoyed seeing this movie in a dramatic new quality!

B0062NAX1U|4.0|I've only recently begun to watch some of the more modern Christian films out there, and \\"Courageous\\" is one of the best.  No, it's not a Hollywood production, but it's not horrible either (I've definitely seen worse).  There is plenty of humor and action, but bring your kleenex too--there are some truly heartwrenching moments.  \\"Courageous\\" deals with some pretty heavy themes like death, moral integrity and responsibility, and what it means to be a godly father.  I loved it, and can't wait to show it to my children--when they're mature enough.  Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is an amazing book. I read it four times and still not bored of it. It is one of the best books I ever read

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|MOVIE RATING:  3.5 stars (B)<br /><br />Sir Ridley Scott is back...to making smart sci-fi movies. Prometheus (2012) is his \\"prequel\\" to the Alien franchise that he started in 1979, and his first sci-fi film in 30 years since his cult favorite Blade Runner (1982). I REALLY wanted to LOVE this movie. Not just like it, but all-out love it.  If only Scott had a better story to match the greatness of everything else that he brought to this fantastic visual and aural blockbuster. Still, there's a lot to love here. And maybe my expectations were so high that there was no way for the film to ever live up. I just saw it yesterday, so I probably need more time to fully appreciate all its details. But my initial take on Promtheus is that it's very good, but not outstanding and not Scott's best work. Sorry, Sir Ridley!!! You know I love your work though. Gladiator (2000) is my current #1 movie of all time. And Thelma & Louise (1991) isn't far behind.<br /><br />Prometheus is an origin story, much like every other sci-fi/fantasy movie of the last decade. But this is about the origin of mankind, not some superhero. So it's grounded in something more realistic and relevant...at least initially. It's picking up the gauntlet thrown down by director Stanley Kubrick with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). If only it didn't just pick it up and then put it on the shelf to be forgotten about. The movie opens with two archaeologists discovering a 35,000 year old cave painting in Scotland that has 6 orbs floating in the sky of its drawing with a large humanoid pointing at them. It's in that 35,000 year old mystery, that the story got me VERY intrigued, in the same way Stargate (1994) got me with it's ancient Egyptian alien archaeology. However, instead of really delving into the origins and mysteries of life on earth and the big questions of is there a God and how did the universe come into being, Prometheus simply turns into a guts-and-glory horror action flick halfway in. At that point, no one, human or alien really cares anymore about the big questions of life that got this whole journey started. They're simply concerned with killing life at whatever cost.<br /><br />I love that the humanoid aliens seemingly created us, but now want to destroy us. But WHY? I don't need a definitive answer, but couldn't we have at least played with the question for awhile after asking it? But maybe that's all Promotheus was ever supposed to give us. I guess I expected more from Sir Ridley Scott at this stage in his filmmaking career. I wanted him to bring the smarts and finesse in his other great films to this one. Now, maybe, just maybe, these questions are meant to be looked at in more detail in Prometheus 2 and 3, which seem likely to have been on Scott and 20th Century Fox's minds during the production of this first one. But as a moviegoer, I want each movie to be complete and great on its own merits as well as across its subsequent sequels if and when they happen. What if we don't get another Prometheus? Then we're left with a movie that's really just a one-act \\"trailer\\" for something that could have or should have been. I know I'm being harsh on Ridley Scott and his team of thousands that worked hard for years to give us Prometheus. But I expected more from a guy who didn't even make the sequel to his original film that helped start this current Hollywood movie franchise mess.<br /><br />Ok...now that I've gotten out the bad, it's time for the good. Prometheus is one of the most visually stunning sci-fi movies of all time. It's pure eye candy from the first frame to the last. Every shot, every graphic, every visual effect, and every set/location just wowed me on the big screen in 4k digital projection. This film was completely shot on the Red Epic digital cinema camera and it shows just how fantastic and \\"filmic\\" digital cinematography can be. I hear the arguments, most recently by director Christopher Nolan, about how digital is not yet at the same level as film,but if Prometheus doesn't put the final nail in that coffin, I don't know what else possibly could. I never once wished that Prometheus was shot on film. It was just so perfect in digital. In fact I don't think it could look as good in film, especially with all the visual effects. I give Director of Photography Dariusz Wolski and his camera team kudos for helping craft one of the best looking movies ever. This movie, and Wolski, better be a candidate for Best Cinematography at next year's Oscars.<br /><br />In terms of acting, Michael Fassbender once again steals the show...this time as an android named David. But most of the cast does a fine job in their contributing roles. I didn't really like Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw though. I think a better actress could have brought more to the role, but she's satisfactory. She's the protagonist that we are being told this story through the eyes of, and maybe that's partly why the story didn't sink in with me as much as I wanted it to. Her character just didn't have the human and emotional character depth that Fassbender's robot had. And I think that's a problem when the robots are more human than the humans. Sigourney Weaver brought something more to the party in her role as Ellen Ripley. Idris Elba was great as the ship's captain, but I wanted more of him. And Charlize Theron played a \\"bitch\\" as good as anyone can. That's a compliment by the way. I would've liked to found out more about the humanoid aliens that created us. One would assume they are as intelligent as us, if not more, but we're given no one to connect with. Too bad.<br /><br />The production design on Prometheus is breathtaking and epic. I can't even imagine all the work by hundreds if not thousands of people that went into designing and building the sets, ships, vehicles, costumes, and props of this world. Arthur Max brought the same greatness to the production design of Prometheus as he brought to Se7en (1995), Gladiator (2000), and Black Hawk Down (2001), all three visual masterpieces.<br /><br />The sound on Prometheus is just as epic and important, if not more so, than the visuals. And the entire sound team executed with precision and power. There's really nothing else to say about it. You just have to hear it in a huge way on the big screen and you know exactly what I mean. The music on the other hand, by composer Marc Streitenfeld is a mixed bag. Half of it is perfect and the other half felt weird to me. Some of the music just didn't fit emotionally in my opinion. I noticed several times that I was taken out of the storytelling because of the music creating the wrong mood. I was surprised because I certainly didn't expect the musical score to not fit on a film like this. I can't really think of any sci-fi film that it hasn't fit on.<br /><br />While Prometheus doesn't quite live up to the high expectations I had for it, the bottom line is that I ABSOLUTELY 100% suggest you see it.but if Prometheus doesn't put the final nail in that coffin, I don't know what else possibly could.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The 3D version for this film is pretty good without the gimmicky in your face kinda 3D but more for the depth and realism plus with the recent Black Friday priced of USD14.99, well it is a good buy. Recommended.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|MOVIE RATING:  4 stars (B+)<br /><br />Being that I'm 50% Swedish and that I've visited Sweden 3 times in my life so far (with a 4th coming in 2015), I'm always interested in movies from the homeland. Whether it's movies set in Sweden, filmed in Sweden, about Swedes, starring Swedes, or made by Swedes. Combine that with one of my favorite directors of all time, David Fincher, and one could easily say I had \\"MASSIVE\\" expectations for The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2011). As my #1 Most Anticipated Movie of Fall 2011, director David Fincher's english-language remake of the Swedish film had a lot to live up to. And it kind of didn't initially. When I first saw the movie in the theater late last year, I was a bit disappointed. It just wasn't exactly what I expected. I thought it lacked the extremely sharp and intelligent writing and feel of The Social Network (2010), Se7en (1995), and Fight Club (1999). Of course the acting, production design, cinematography, editing, sound, and music are all stellar and as good as any of Fincher's finest films. But the story just didn't grab me like those three masterpieces at first. I now see I was a bit too harsh on it. So I've upgraded my initial rating of 3.5 stars to 4 stars.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgård and the rest of the supporting cast give absolutely wonderful performances. The casting was spot on. Yorick van Wageningen was an incredible discovery as the man that tortures and rapes Lisbeth Salander. As with every Fincher film, the production design is so perfectly detailed and brought to life that I felt completely like I was in Sweden (as I remember it from my trips), down to the details of the open-faced sandwiches. Donald Graham Burt is a master Production Designer, and that's evidenced by his incredible filmography. Of course Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is hypnotizing, surprisingly appropriate, and flat out original. I don't know how these guys come up with their music, and how Fincher and his editing team incorporate these pieces so well, but they did it again after nailing it on The Social Network (2010).<br /><br />I really can't say enough about how beautiful and perfect the cinematography is by Jeff Cronenweth and his team. Shot entirely on Red digital cinema cameras, mostly the Red Epic, TGWTDT reminds us all why film is basically dead as the primary medium for making movies today. With the Red Epic and Arri Alexa digital cinema cameras, the imagery and dynamic range that can be captured in various lighting conditions is simply the best its ever been in the digital age. And Cronenweth really knows how to use his Red tools. You can take just about any and every frame from the movie (all 227,520 of them), and look at it as a piece of still art work.<br /><br />The editing team of Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall provided a technically perfect edit that seamlessly marriages dialog, visuals, sound effects, music, and graphics, but I do think TGWTDT suffers from a pacing problem in its storytelling sometimes. It stalls and lags at times, causing me to lose interest. Whether that's an issue of writing within the screenplay from screenwriter Steven Zaillian, or an editing issue, I'm not totally sure. I haven't seen the original Swedish movie or read the original Stieg Larsson novel, so it's hard to say if it's in the translation from Swedish to English, or from book to film, or if it's just David Fincher's style. I do think the pacing is less of an issue on repeated viewings when one knows what's going to happen and where its going. But that's true of most movies. Regardless, I do think this was a very successful remake of a foreign language film that brought an original approach to the material and a new style and feel to it to appeal to an American audience. I actually hope they do remake the other 2 films in the trilogy.music, and how Fincher and his editing team incorporate these pieces so well, but they did it again after nailing it on The Social Network (2010).<br /><br />I really can't say enough about how beautiful and perfect the cinematography is by Jeff Cronenweth and his team.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|The first episode is a little slow, but this series is fantastic. It picks up quickly and I wound up watching it on Netflix in 2 nights, then I had to purchase it, waiting for a good weekend to watch the first three seasons before the final one comes on
B003L20IHO|4.0|MOVIE RATING:  3.5 stars (B)<br /><br />Sometimes you have to steer clear of the crowd, and with Charlie St. Cloud (2010), that's what I have to do. While both moviegoers and film critics generally panned this movie, I think they missed the mark on this one. While it may not be edgy or completely original, both its star Zac Efron and the film try to go places that so few movies dare to. To some degree, Charlie St. Cloud is like Field of Dreams (1989). You have to buy into it's nearly ludicrous concept of the story being told in both the real world and in another world, namely purgatory or some other realm where the spirits of dead people come to life. I'm not really giving anything away because the concept is right there in the trailer and early on in the movie.<br /><br />Director Burr Steers had a challenging job bringing this story to the screen, but I think he assembled a good cast and a good team to execute his vision. It's been awhile since we've since Kim Basinger on screen in anything significant. Her role as Charlie's mother is slight, but I enjoyed what little we got of her. Augustus Prew plays a fun sidekick character, and I liked Charlie Tahan as the younger St. Cloud brother, Sam. Rounding out the supporting cast is Donal Logue and Ray Liotta, two under utilized actors. I'm not really a fan of Amanda Crew as Charlie's love interest, Tess, but she does what she needs to.<br /><br />Yes, the movie is a bit of a soap opera at times. And yes, it's predictable at times. And yes, Efron over acts at times. But somehow I was able to get past all of that and connect with the heart of the story and its characters and the message they deliver. The cinematography is stunning, the production design beautiful, and overall, this is a story and world I liked visiting. You might just like it too if you give it a chance.

B009A9ETFE|5.0|This album is a greatest hits compilation with one new song.  It's hard not to give this 5 stars since it is a greatest hits album.  HIM is a great band!
B00000IQW5|5.0|This movie was recommended to me. It is a great love story and has some wonderful aviation scenes for those who love old planes.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|really enjoyed until it erased my score twice. I had 100,000+ coins, the zombie character, and a top score of 270,000+ points before my stuff was deleted twice.<br />fun but irritating.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Hello all<br />Last week I was reading reviews of this book just as you are right now and with mixed emotions I decided to give Mike a try.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did! This book has finally given me no-nonsense answers to many questions regarding nutrition, workouts and supplements. After bouncing around the marketing merry-go-round within the fitness industry for a few years, I found what I have been searching for.<br /><br />Now I'm excited to get started again, because I'm confident results are at my fingertips. Mr.GNC salesman you will never see me again, along with the so called trainer I have consulted. Mike- Thank you!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is the first book I have read by Rowling.  It is the Polar opposite of her Potter books.  The plot line is very thin and the story convoluted with gutter language.  I read it only due to her reputation as a writer.  Since I had the Kindle version I felt obligated to read it.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|Terrible movie and terrible acting. Jolie sucks. Dont buy this movie save your money it is boring and has TERRIBLE acting!
B0054YIQK8|5.0|I was surprised the opera was filmed like a movie. I really enjoy watching it. And the singing is beautiful.

B0086700CM|5.0|Used to play this one on my iphone and now it gives me a bigger and better experience on my kindle. Love it.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Loved the other 3 Bourne flicks.  I have no idea what the plot was in this one.  Just seemed to meander on.  Awesome action scenes and stellar cinematography.<br /><br />They made some attempt to tie it in with the other 3, but it was pretty weak.  Probably would have made a better movie on it's own with a more in-depth story line.<br /><br />Won't be buying this one, or ever watching it again.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I don't know that I can add anything to the other five star reviews.  Courtney Milan just gets better and better.  This is a wonderful romance about two very flawed human beings who have suffered terribly as children, but who are able to do more than just survive; they work toward the happy ending they deserve.  Even as I thought, no, don't do it! (I do tend to talk to the characters in books as if they are real sometimes) regarding the actions taken by the hero and heroine, I understood completely why they acted as they did. That is why Milan is so good; her characters' behaviors always make sense. But while this book contains angst, it is also a fun read. There is humor and there are interesting secondary characters.  If you haven't read the novella that is the prequel to this book, do so.  It is excellent as well and fleshes out the back story of the hero.  You don't need to read the novella, [[ASIN:1477589031 The Governess Affair]] because this title works as a stand alone, but read it for the pleasure it will bring you.  And can I just say, I absolutely adored the hero, Robert, The Duke of Clermont.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|While parts of this book were difficult to read, some for the language of island inhabitants, some for the content, I found Cloud Atlas to be a glimpse of the past, present and future, through a soul reborn into each quest. Thank you, David Mitchell, for the magical journey!
B008D28HYS|4.0|Love this game. Just wish there were hints as on the more difficult levels I sometimes get stumped & can't figure out the next step. That's frustrating. Do love getting additional puzzles. Wish there were more.
0525953590|4.0|I , definitely no science or math geek. I am a history and languages person. I bought this for my daughter is double majoring in biomedical engineering and math and figured it would be a fascinating read for her. I started reading it and found it very interesting and was able to follow what this discovery of the boson was, why it is such a scientific achievement, and how it will eventually revolutionize our every day lives like electricity to the Internet but in ways we cannot fully comprehend yet. It is a new energy source. If you like to learn, as I do, it is something you would otherwise miss unless you are are in the scientific field.
B0015AARJI|5.0|the controller is fun and easy to use.  we enjoy using our playstation 2 and the handheld handheld device is very convenient.
1452101248|5.0|This cookbook is so beautifully illustrated, has such a luscious padded cover, that I keep it on my coffee table so I can browse through it frequently. Many of the recipes look inspiring and delicious, although I am still at the &#34;devouring with my eyes&#34; stage! I was so impressed with this book I bought a second copy as a gift for a friend.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I read this with my prime membership and I would recommend it. I probably wouldn't have bought this book which makes Amazon Prime a must have. This was a very good concept for a book. I never would have guessed it would end the way it did. Most books are predictable. This has a nice twist to the end if you like that sort of thing then buy it and happy reading.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Kept missing the beginning on tv. Now I can watch this surprising good movie from beginning to end.  Well worth the price
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I am so mixed about this film I am not sure what to write. When the movie started off, I thought this is going to be really good. Unfortunately as the movie went on I just lost interest. Not enough to turn it off, but this definitely was not my favorite Johnny Depp movie.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|This book took me two months to read,  because many factors made this book read very slowly. While the book does have great characters, the structure of plot and writing decisions Scott lynch  makes drags down the otherwise strong foundation he has created.<br /><br />-Misplaced narration<br /><br />Lynch decides to frame his story in a strange fashion. We are shown Locke Lamora as a kid,  then an adult,  then a kid again,  etc. It feels odd,  and at times I felt like I knew too much of what Lynch was trying to do by writing the narrative in this way. If he needs a certain amount of back story,  he makes the reader jump back in time,  then once established,  he makes the reader go forward in time and use that back story to explain a current event. It's not as successful as laying out the narrative in a linear fashion,  then letting the reader recall something important to their own satisfaction. In some ways I felt like the author was not exactly shoving things in my face, but not giving me some credit that I am invested in the story.<br /><br />-Very slow plot<br /><br />The plot isn't very complicated in this book,  but due to the narrative style as before mentioned it moves slowly. You don't find out whats going on till the last hundred pages or so,  and until then there isn't much action.  The bad thing about this was that in the end things felt like they happened too fast in comparison with the rest of the book,  and the emotional attachment I had formed to the characters that died,  felt a bit cheated.  It would have been better to have it in a linear fashion,  so as a reader we could grow with the characters,  instead of being forced back into the past to see what has happened.<br /><br />-Too much lyrical and dense prose to explain setting<br /><br />Lynch spends a lot of time outlining the city that the characters live in. None of these parts are quite as effective as his simpler exposition about specific elements in the story.  Instead at the beginning of most chapters he uses a style that shifts into a more poetic and dense form. It's not as clear to read as the rest of the novel, and requires much more focus. In effect,  it bogs down the narrative and gives the book too many excess pages. He goes on and on about certain things,  and I cannot recall much of the setting that he put so much effort into creating. There a few good strengths in this world building,  but it is elsewhere found than in the prose that you will find at the beginning of every chapter.<br /><br />-Loose ends not tied up<br /><br />There are a few things that never get cleared up in this book. I won't mention them,  but don't expect romance of any kind.  I was waiting throughout the entire book to at least get a flashback,  or a surprise twist.<br /><br />Despite the books flaws,  it still gets three stars.  There are a few interesting twists,  brutal scenes,  and cunning characters that thrilled me enough to get through the rest of the boring parts.most chapters he uses a style that shifts into a more poetic and dense form.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I liked the concept. I just don't seem to enjoy some of these later books as much as I did his books in the beginning. Definitely worth the read though.
044042335X|5.0|So far this is the best Jack Reacher novel I have read. I absolutely loved every minute of reading this story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Entertaining to read with many puzzling situation in the story line. Surprised by the ending. It would make a wonderful book club discussion.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I love his books.  Shadow of the Wind is still my favorite and probably always will be. I enjoyed The Angel's Game, but not as much. This one brought The Angel's Game to a whole new level for me. You don't have to read them in any kind of order, and you don't have to read one to enjoy another, but its wonderful if you do. The stories are quite beautiful. I can't wait for the final installment. Be sure to read the short story, The Rose of Fire, too.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I would recommend Dance with Dragons because it continues the story line of The Song of Ice and Fire. It left me with many unanswered questions which hopefully will be answered with the next series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this series of books based on the reviews. I put off reading it because of the title, which had, indeed, pulled the wool over my eyes. This book was so unlike anything I've ever read.  Sci-Fi/Thriller/Adventure all rolled into one.  The heros are believable, sometimes the good guys die, my kind of book.  I don't like predictable. Best of all, a lot of my own questions were answered. What's even scarier,is that I can totally imagine such a scenario in the distant future.  I am a bit of a snob, in that I usually only read best sellers.  This author, Hugh Howey, is destined to be one of the greats.  I set him squarely between Wilbur Smith and Stephen King.
B0068VZNGG|4.0|Okay, so Blind Guardian sets down to remix their old classics to release on their first best of album. Sounds like a pretty good idea for a band thats been around for such a long time, but here are many gems missing that should have been here.<br /><br />For example I would rather prefer Banished From Sanctuary instead of Ride Into Obsession. It surprises me that the all time classic Time Stand Still (At the Iron Hill) isnt present here, why not?!<br />And here is only one song from A Night At The Opera album (And Then There Was Silence) and its a re-recorded version.<br /><br />But enough about complains for now.<br />The remix thing is pretty okay since some old songs production was really bad and now sounds more fresh and cleaned up. The re-recorder version of The Bard Song (The Hobbit) is amazing in my opinion so if you have missed that, check it out ;)<br />In The Forest song on the other hand sounds like crap now with all the symphony thrown in.<br /><br />I dont really think fans need this album but see it as a fun treat and for beginners its a good start.<br />I look forward to the new box set A Traveler's Guide To Space And Time which will contain all albums up to Nightfall In Middle Earth and for the first time ever on CD, Imaginations Through The Looking Glass concert! Thats some amazing stuff one cant miss out on!
B002N7P23I|4.0|I had watched 'Quarantine' so watching the Spanish original (with subtitles) was not all that thoroughly exciting. Still, one can't deny that this one led the way in handheld spook and provides some effective chills and thrills.<br />Must watch if you are a fan of this sub-genre...<br />Try 'Grave Encounters' too if so..
B00005J6UP|5.0|this movie was one of my favorites when i was younger i think its alot of peoples favorite from that day..there will never be another made as good as the original.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I adore this app.  It's great for relaxing on a much needed lunch break after a stressful morning at work.  Also useful for calming down my 2 yr old when she is having a bad moment.  She especially likes the heartbeat.<br />Of the hundreds of apps I have, this is one of the few that I will not uninstall (unless it flops later on).  I've encountered no intolerable issues and use it multiple times a day.  I plan to use it the first time tonight to reach a state of relaxation/meditation prior to praying.  I anticipate my mind being calm and quiet enough to hear God speak.  Thank you, Inpos Software Inc for a fine app.<br />Sincerely,<br />LT
B000JML7EC|5.0|Has stood the test of time and is worth another read if it has been a while. If you've only seen one or more of the movies, it's high time you read the real thing.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was searching for new & different cases for family members.  I liked this option & price so added it to the Christmas pile to give out.  Thank you for offereing so many options at low prices.  Now I'm able to offer little gifts to family & have extra for pop-up gifts needed.  This one is actually going to be MINE!  :)<br /><br />That was my orginal review.  After installing it was at first fine.  Then day 2, learned earphone jack would not work with any of my connectors & sound would not turn on/off.  Day 3, when took more pictures (day 2's were fine) were blurry in lower left hand corner, no matter the lighting.  Day 4, The charging port was too small/tight for an Apple brand car charger.<br /><br />This case was the most horrible one I have ever owned, especially after I was so excited.<br /><br />I contact the LifeProof company about the problems and they replied with an inquiry about info & serial numbers on front & back.  They replied stating the case was a counterfit and this was a common & increasing problem with many Amazon sellers.  First time my confidence in using Amazon, but will now just invistigate more before any purchase unless a known & used seller.<br /><br />PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER IF YOU WANT A TRUE CASE, NOT A COUNTERFIET!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My two year old's new favorite movie. She watches it every day. The story is interesting and very sweet. I enjoy watching it as a parent as much as my daughter enjoys watching it. It never gets boring even after having watched it about twenty times already. Every time I discover something new.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I was most impressed not by Bilbo, Gandalf or the Dwarfs, but by the Brown Wizard, who is one of the Five Great Wizards of Middle Earth. Not only does he save Gandalf and the dwarfs in one incredibly brilliant move while driving a sled pulled by jackrabbits but he also fearlessly protects all life in his forest. As a solitary wizard, with only animals as his companions, he is literally a guardian angel. He is also on the front lines. Some mysterious evil force is invading his forest. He has real power and he's not afraid to use it to heal or repel evil! Tolkien was obviously an ardent environmentalist & conservationist and I'm so glad this version of The Hobbit makes that perfectly clear!<br /><br />One of my other favorite scenes is when Gandalf compares his approach to combating great evil with Saruman's. I'm paraphrasing here, but Gandalf believes to fight great evil it's an accumulation of small acts of kindness and the power of compassion that in the end will triumph over great evil. While Saruman believes only great power can defeat great evil. Gandalf and Saruman's approach to combating evil are as opposite as day is to night! We all know from The Lord of the Rings who's philosophy was right in the end!<br /><br />See:[[ASIN:0813129869 Ents, Elves, and Eriador: The Environmental Vision of J.R.R. Tolkien (Culture of the Land)]] and [[ASIN:0954478827 Tolkien and Politics]]

0547884591|5.0|I bought this book mostly for the life hacking/quick learning portion however, after a couple of looks over, the cooking portion caught my attention and I am now learning how to make awesome meals as well as be more efficient in life. There are lots of bonus extras that are super interesting (how to shoot a 3 pointer, speed read, etc) and overall the book is beautiful and an enjoyable read. Thanks Tim!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger games continue with an unimaginable twist. Book two is heart wrenching, and even harder to put down. Wow.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a story that I couldn't predict. The characters held so many secrets. Want to read it yet?  The only reason I gave this book less than 5 stars was because I wasn't fond of the ending.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a VERY interesting book.  I think with our busy lives we miss quite a lot of the quieter, more subtle things that are always around us and I am GRATEFUL for this well written reminder.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I won't bother with summarizing the plot, which I'd spend \\"all day doing, making diagrams with straws.\\"<br /><br />I can only say that this is the best SF film I've seen in ages, though I'll be the first to admit that time travel is my favorite \\"sub-genre\\" in the field.  \\"Looper\\" is a no-B.S., hard-hitting flick that goes right to the heart of the questions of free will versus destiny that time travel stories have always excelled at, with numerous hommages and in-jokes towards earlier films thrown in to keep movie geeks happy.  Though perhaps it's just me, this is the first film that ever made me ask whether the life I'm living now would be the one I'd want to look back on fondly 30 years down the road, which is a big theme of the movie:  Just how good is hindsight?  Foresight?<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" gives you no simple answers; there are no good guys, no bad guys; as Young Joe says, it's all about men figuring how what they'd do to keep what's theirs, \\"what they got\\".  This is a theme that pops up again and again, disturbing and insistent, and the ending gives you no guarantees that the solution was in fact the right one.  In fact, one of the sad--and profound--aspects of the film is that, for all that the two versions of Joe differ, they have more in common than either is willing to admit, and it's this unspoken tension that drives the plot, from the opening scene to the very end if you think about it.<br /><br />I could go on about this ad infinitum, but the bottom line is that \\"Looper\\" is an astounding, disturbing, and unforgettable movie that is worth no less than two viewings.  I plan to be front and center on New Year's Eve when it comes out in hard-copy.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|Good songs; excellent accompaniment. Standards from a bye-gone era.  Terrific! Downloaded directly with easy directions. Thanks, Amazon! Always a great experience.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|First to the people that say they were charged or that it doesnt work on your kindle fire or any other issues how about you try to fix it your self first. The app is after all for FREE Amazon didnt have to create a cloud app, but they did. You really think they would create an app thag doesnt work on their own product?! If uninstalling and reinstalling doesnt work them do some work on search engines or Amazons help files for options or alternatives.<br /><br />They would not make a new product that wouldn't work on the Kindle Fire's that would be logically stupid on so many tech and business levels. If I can run this app on a old Samsung Galaxy Epic 1st gen phone then you can most certainly run it on you up to date kindle or tablet. My table (if your curious) isnt a Kindle but my friends is. My tablet is Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0.<br /><br />This app is obviously VERY new and with any type of software, or new pc, new tablet, new anything in the electronic world there are going to be little issues and updates will ALWAYS follow. Just be patient.<br /><br />This app is set up right now for PHOTOS ONLY I am sure this will change. For those that have any brain cells working YES this is all connected to the cloud drive period. If you go to Amazons website or help section it clear describes two services, one for music/mp3 that is free up to a limit or you can then purchase a annual subscription for tons of more space to store your entire music collection. Then there is The Cloud. This is for ALL files from photos, documents, etc. The app sadly only handles photos and syncing which is great, but if your paying for a service then you want it to naturally have more and include the ability to conduct the files too. This is all new so I hope to see updates in the future. (Side note, someone said there is another amazon cloud app for everything else, there isnt as far as I can tell, I checked.)<br /><br />For those that say other competetors are cheaper, review your math skills. Idid a price comparison chart to compare which is the better buy, especially to huge rivals like the big G, and guess what??? The price is about the same! When you break it down per dollar per Gigabyte the amounts the SAME. The major difference is payment, Amazon only does annually, the big G does ONLY monthly, they have no billing method set up yet for anual payments. They said they would add this in later/soon.<br /><br />OVERALL..if you are already using Amazon services to buy things, to get books (its original source of popularity), or music (they have better rates and specials on music than that piece of fruit named product), then this should be added to your collection. It will make things easier and prevent you from loosing your photos on that precious device if it should ever experience a firey or watery pit o'doom.

B00867GJYK|5.0|I've loved Finding Nemo since the first time I saw it in theatre - it's possibly my favorite Disney-Pixar film EVER.  You tear up, you laugh, you're fascinated with the gorgeous underwater world, you'll never forget those quirky characters or look at a Clownfish (or a shark for that matter) the same way again.  It's no wonder it won an Academy Award!<br /><br />I was thrilled when I found out it was finally out on Blu-Ray - everything looks better Blu-Ray, and this is no exception!  It's crisp and clear and vivid, a delight to watch.  And the special features are great, there are deleted scenes and even an alternate movie opening.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />  Knick Knack Theatrical Short<br />  Aquarium<br />  CineExplore<br />  ReInventing The Submarine Voyage<br />  Deleted Scene: Alternate Opening<br />  A Lesson in Flashbacks<br />  Finding Nemo: A Filmmakers' Discussion<br />  Outtakes & Deleted Scenes<br />  Art Review<br /><br />If you're looking to upgrade your Disney DVDs to Blu-Ray I recommend this edition highly!<br /><br />Note: I was provided with this movie for review purposes. Don't let that bother you, though - I always give my honest opinions no matter how I get it.  :)

1594489505|5.0|What a gut-wrenching story. I cannot express the emotions I had as a woman reading what Afghan women were going through at the hands of their men during this time period. The book explains in vivid terms how the women were treated and what little value was placed on them. Unlike the author's first book 'The Kite Runner' where i was mostly sad, this book made me more angry than anything else. I am glad that in the end we saw Laila reclaiming her life and I hope that all Afghan women will get this chance.

0525958002|5.0|I was not part of the generation that idolized DD.  I have never owned a physical album or a record.  Nonetheless, I still adore the band for what it is in my head.<br /><br />I discovered them as a young teen, decades after the heyday, while listening to a series of history on music.  The episode that most caught my eye was on the history of music videos.  The rest was listening history.  I picked up his book thanks to his thought-provoking interview on Q with Jian Ghomeshi (still available online if anyone wants a listen).<br /><br />A lot of reviewers seemed angry that this wasn't a divulgence of everything that happened.  In my mind, I'd imagine that years of drug use may fog some memories.  It seems like he kept a full diary.  Maybe JT is not as open about issues as Andy Taylor is.  Not everyone is going to write a memoir that includes every detail.  I thought he was being true and honest when he said that he didn't want to get into the feuds he'd had between bandmates and record companies.  The story about the crabs was really funny to me.<br /><br />I, too, sat and read this in one sitting.  It wasn't eloquently or poetically written.  Sometimes I would have to ask, \\"Who?,\\" when JT would mention someone in the business.  It's still a great story with lots of trivia and tidbits.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|If you like a good laugh community (any of them really) are quite entertaining. Great gift for a friend! :)

1449410243|4.0|The book itself is fairly humorous, especially if you enjoy the sense of humor employed by The Oatmeal. I was going to purchase this as a gift for my mother (as something of a joke, as she contracted cat scratch disease [a.k.a. cat scratch fever, which is apparently more than just a Ted Nugent song]), however I decided to read it prior to giving it to her. This turned out to be a good idea, as I found that many of the jokes were ones you may not want to tell your mother. To wrap this all up: good for you, bad for mom.
0307887448|5.0|This has been my lunch book for a week or so and got me back late for work a few times (even though no one was watching). Very creative, clever and interesting. I was not as geeky as the central characters, especially with regard to movies, but it was fun to review the development of computers and video games. Brought back memories of playing the console versions of Pac Man and Donkey Kong and some of the early units like the Intellivision. Just what a novel is supposed to do - transport one to a different world - reality or otherwise!
1449433251|2.0|I chose the gift wrap option because I wanted to be able to open the box infront of my husband with out having to hide it - it was his birthday gift. And since his birthday is so close to Christmas we do not always have &#34;Birthday&#34; wrapping paper on hand. When I opened the box... the gift was &#34;wrapped&#34;... and the wrapping paper was SHREDDED. Completely pointless to pay extra for wrapping a present if it is going to arrive tattered and in shreds. FAIL, Amazon!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|For those who do not know, and are expecting to see Matt Damon reprise his role as Jason Bourne in this movie, he does not.  He is referred to, and some of the events in the Bourne Ultimatum are tied into this movie, but this is a separate story.  I do think Jeremy Renner and (the ageless) Rachel Weisz perform well in their respective roles.  Weisz does a great job as a doctor who is somewhat naive about the consequences of her work.  Renner also does a good job as Cross and makes him different enough from Bourne that is does not just seem to be a total rehash of what we have already seen.  Edward Norton also does a good job as the government foil who is trying to hunt down Cross.<br /><br />As my title says, this movie expands the Bourne Universe beyond the operatives we already knew existed.  It certainly sets up the possibility of more movies including the possibility that Bourne and Cross will team up at some point.  You get the requisite balance of action and story as were in the other movies.  Like in the other movies it does slow down in the middle, but I did not find it was dragging too much for me.  You also get the trademark Bourne chase scene near the end of the movie.  This time a motorcycle chase through Manilla.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you enjoyed the other movies (as long as you are not one of those who cannot see anyone other than Damon in the lead role) you will probably find this one enjoyable as well.  While there are elements from the other movies (and even continues the story line from the Bourne Ultimatum at the end) it does for the most part stand on its own.  Like the other movies, it does take a good amount of suspension of disbelief, because there are certainly absurd moments, but if you can get beyond that I recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all of the books! This one was especially great. I'll miss not reading more about these characters. Can't wait to see if the next movie will do it justice
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I liked this spin on the story. Threw in some honest Abe in there and some spin. It was a fun movie. Very different type of movie. Quite dramatic as far as filmography goes. Abe suffers from personal tragedy and tries to go after the killer. He is stopped by someone who takes him under his wing and trains him. Think Zorro with Anthonio Banderas. Only this one has vampires in it.

Because of Eben Alexander M.D. (author's) career knowledge and experience as a brain neurosurgeon who understands the mapping and behavior of the brain, his book stands out far beyond others. The book is an uncanny blend of science and spirituality that examines the two questions: Why are we here? Where are we going? Everybody dies. You want to know about it? Then, read this book.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|~ If you loved Sopranos . . . . need I say more ???<br /><br />This is the beginning of the 1900's. Where families were looking to the new world and turf wars were just starting out.<br />Anyone who is anybody from the old countries came here and started anew. If you love history with gangstars, Prohibition,<br />Al Capone, Chicago, New York, Boston, New Jersey, the Italians, Irish, Jews, Blacks, Scotts, Hungarians and so on and so on. This is what your looking for. This is the second season for Boardwalk Empire.<br /><br />Where The Boardwalk Empire is an American cinematic television series from cable network HBO, set in Atlantic City, New Jersey during the Prohibition era. It stars Steve Buscemi as Nucky Thompson. The show was adapted by Emmy Award-winning screenwriter and producer Terence Winter (of The Sopranos) from a book about historical criminal kingpin Enoch L. Johnson by Nelson Johnson, titled Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City.Boardwalk Empire is a period drama focusing on Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson (based on the historical Enoch L. Johnson), a political figure who rose to prominence and controlled Atlantic City, New Jersey, during the Prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s. Nucky interacts with several historical figures in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who look up to him. The federal government also takes an interest in the bootlegging and other illegal activities in the area, sending agents to investigate possible mob connections but also looking at Nucky's lifestyle--expensive and lavish for a county political figure.<br /><br />The second season begins in January 1921. Jimmy, Eli, and the Commodore move along with their plot to remove Nucky from power. Nucky has suspected a plot, especially after a Ku Klux Klan attack on Chalky White's warehouse and Jimmy's increasingly distant attitude. The Commodore's faction decides to frame Nuckyfor election fraud, vengeance for the Commodore's own imprisonment for similar charges.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|After hearing so many people praise this show and seeing random episodes on AMC I decided to take it upon myself to give it a shot.  Zombies always have interested me and this show definitely fills that nitch.  The show starts more about survival in a chaotic world with how people thrive with flesh eating dead walking about but ends up being more about the horrors of how terrible humans can be.  Very well written and the actors are spectacular.  Would easily recommend to anyone and the digital content allow for mobile viewing in HD to catch up to season 3.

B002QW7ALM|3.0|Mix one part [[ASIN:B000MFYTD2 The Descent]], one part [[ASIN:B00498VS1E Alien]], and one part [[ASIN:B004EARTN8 Buried]] and you get a movie like Pandorum. Keeping this in mind, if you don't like the dark or are claustrophobic, this movie isn't for you. It's a sci-fi action/horror movie that is extremely atmospheric and suspenseful. The story is an intriguing one, though not entirely different from other storylines you might find in similar movies or video games: Some of the crew of a deep-space transport vessel awake to find that something is very wrong with the ship and its crew. Systems are malfunctioning, many of the operational staff are either dead or missing, and somthing on the ship is hunting them. They realize that they have precious little time to get the ship's reactor functional again before they completely lose all power and hope of survival. Of course, there are many obstacles and hidden dangers in their path andnobody completely trusts one another.<br /><br />Like I said before, it's a tense, mysterious movie that most sci-fi fans will probably enjoy. It was more enjoyable than I thought it would be, for sure.

1577314808|2.0|\\"The Power of Now\\" is a cool title, but it doesn't belong on the cover of this book, which has virtually nothing to say about the true Power, or Light-energy, stemming from the Now, the Divine Presence. If Eckhart Tolle were anything more than a superficial pop mystic, he'd equate the power of Now with Hindu Shakti, the Buddhist Sambhogakaya, and the Christian Holy Spirit, and explain how this radiant continuum of Light-energy literally en-Light-ens a disciple.<br /><br />Virtually every time Tolle opens his mouth and says anything, out comes poppycock.  Aside from his message to \\"be here now,\\" which is common to many mystical traditions, he seems incapable of any of what J. Krishnamurti calls \\"real intelligence.\\" Moreover, some of the messages that Tolle spreads are not just stupid, but also potentially destructive.<br /><br />Tolle's most negative message concerns the human mind. According to Tolle, man's egoic mind is not capable of creativity, and even worse, it is insane and destructive and pollutes the planet. Given Tolle's bizarrely apocalyptic mentality, I would say that he's guilty of projection.<br /><br />Tolle's modus operandi is empty, hysterical rhetoric. He seems incapable of dealing in specifics. What, exactly, is the major (mind-caused) problem threatening the existence of the planet today? Is it global warming? Communism?  Capitalism? Radical Islam?  Tolle doesn't say. And, egregiously, he fails to inform us what kind of sociopolitical system his NOW World Order will implement.<br /><br />Tolle claims that women, because of menses and their collective pain-body, are more spiritually evolved than men and will be the vanguard of the NOW Age movement. Balderdash. The Buddha said exactly the opposite about women, and Jesus skipped on female apostles. I've yet to read or listen to a female guru capable of profound, technical Dharma instruction. Men are at the forefront of most every major sociopolitical or spiritual movement, not women. If, as Tolle claims, a collective pain-body leads to spiritual evolvement, then why aren't African-Americans at the leading edge of New Age spirituality?<br /><br />Tolle claims that \\"your cells stop aging when you live in the Now.\\" Pure hogwash. I did a research study of arguably the most prominent spiritual gurus in the twentieth- century, and their average age of death was 70. Here's the data, with the age of death in parentheses: Sri Aurobindo (78); Sri Chinmoy (76); Adi Da (Franklin Jones) (69); Georg Gurdjieff (73); J. Krishnamurti (90); Murshid Samuel Lewis (74); Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh) (58); Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj (84); Ramana Maharshi (70); Swami Muktananada (74); H.W.L. Poonja (Papaji) (86); Swami Ramdas (79); Ramakrishna (50); Suzuki Roshi (66); Swami Satchidananda (87); Swami Sivananda (75); Chogyam Trungpa (49); Swami Vishnudevananda (65); Swami Vivekananda (39); Paramahansa Yogananda (59).<br /><br />Tolle likens ducks and cats to Zen masters who live mindlessly in the Now. Again, utter nonsense. I studied duck behavior for several years, and they hold grudges, habitually harass certain other ducks, and regularly sexually rape their fellow ducks. And every cat I've ever had was a fraidy cat, while none was a Zen master. Tolle mistakenly conflates pre-rational mindlessness with trans-rational Mind-fullness.<br /><br />Tolle says emotions can be trusted more than thought. Terrible advice! Emotions are not tools of cognition; they only tell you how you feel about something. For example, if you're on a diet and confronted with ice cream and cake, do you go with your craving emotion to indulge, or obey you rational mind and desist from the super-fattening treat?<br /><br />Tolle states that the \\"inner body\\" is the direct spiritual link to Being (or God). Again, wrong.  Focusing your attention on your animating presence or invisible \\"inner,\\" or subtle, etheric body cannot take you directly into spiritual Being. The dimension of human existence through which humans partake of the Absolute\\" isn't, as Tolle asserts, the prana-maya-kosha (or life-force sheath). Rather, it is the ananda-maya-kosha (or bliss sheath, which is a synonym for Shakti, Ananda, the Sambhogakaya, and the Holy Spirit, none of which Tolle acknowledges.<br /><br />Because this is a book review and not a book, I'll cut my critique of \\"The Power of Now\\" short. But if you're interested in a more thorough consideration and critique of Eckhart Tolle's teachings, you might want to check out the books I've written on the subject.kosha (or life-force sheath).

Marilyn Manson, while often appearing to live deep in his mind, still has the ability to see the big picture and the humility to laugh at himself at the same time. This book proves to me that honesty and frankness is more appreciated than a candy coated image.

0783233477|2.0|Claire Forlani has the weeping eyes and face of a Renaissance holy portrait and Anthony Hopkins was smoldering lion-like Anthony Hopkins. Brad Pitt played his patented combination of Tyler Durdin from Fight Club and Crazy Jeffrey from 12 Monkeys (a role combination he's still riffing on) and that alone is worth checking this film out for. But THREE HOURS!?!? When a movie stretches over the 100 minute mark you can bet that the music is going to be driving the show and here its sugary thick and syrupy and poured over everything all the time without let up. The actors mumble to each other and whisper throughout and the constant music swells make it almost impossible to hear them. The movie hasn't a trace of quiet nuance or subtlety despite attempts by the main actors to try for it, and you just know they knew this thing would bomb the way it did. I'm sure the Hallmark statuette crowd (\\"I wuv you this much!\\") and kitten lovers everywhere have a copy of this by their favorite flannel pjs ready for that chilly winter night with some herbal tea, but really the movie is like shooting vanilla pudding directly into your arteries. Jeffrey Tambor crying? That's what you paid to see? Really? That kind of thing makes me want to smash public property it's so phony. I was hoping for a slight trace of metaphysical imagery, I mean the spirit inhabiting Brad Pitt's character is DEATH! Hello? Sorry folks nothing meaningful here. A made for the mall, Hallmark sentiment, plastic, sugary, mess with the worst, most intrusive music. Horrible sound, non-existent editing, strange casting (Jeffrey Tambor as a cry-baby, youngish son-in-law? Huh?). the picture was doomed by some Hollywood idiot's vision of an old-style Hollywood blockbuster. The waste of money on this film must have been staggering.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|I own the DVD extended version of Dune and its companion disk set, Children of Dune.  This is a great Sci-Fi disk collection and if you enjoy staying indoors on a nasty rainy or snowy day, this makes a great way to spend it. I don't go for Blu-Ray and care less about all the hype.  What makes a movie a good or great movie hasn't a thing to do with Blu-Ray but has everything to do with the story-line and plot. Dune has it all !<br />I highly recommend this movie and I will not go into any one part, because I do not wish to ruin it for those who have never watched the movie before. Some people just can't resist telling about parts or even the entire movie and that ruins it for those who want to see it from the start to finish.  Just believe me when I say Dune is a Great Sci-Fi movie. Grab a big bowl of hot buttered popcorn, a nice blanket if you need it and get ready for a great ( Movie ) story !

B008RZF2I0|5.0|Long time Kamelot fan. This is their most  ambitious project yet. Former vocalist Khan has been replaced by Seventh Wonder vocalist Tommy Karevik who has done a phenomenal job of bridging the gap between the brooding, emotional vocal style of Khan and his own style which is a purer, more modern style. He has captured the essence of the Kamelot vibe far better than any who have tried before him, and in my opinion, nailed it. The songwriting team of guitarist Thomas Youngblood and keyboard virtuoso Oliver Palotai is hitting on all 8 cylinders, and just in terms of melodic structure, this stuff is infectious. I can't get these songs out of my head! As a jaded musician of more years than I want to admit, that's saying a lot.

Now that the Companies Act 2006 is fully in force, this edition focuses on the impact of the changes resulting from this pivotal piece of legislation.<br /><br />As the company secretary has a formidably broad range of responsibilities, this volume certainly does cover a lot of ground, including statutory accounts, membership, directors and capital.  Certainly all the responsibilities pertaining to corporate governance are dealt with, including employment, pensions, insurance and taxation and health and safety.<br /><br />New materials include, citing only a few examples, the revised UK Corporate Governance Code which applies to the accounting periods beginning on or after 1st October 2012.  Also revised are the sections on tax, VAT, PAYE and National Insurance, as well as the planned changes to the registration of charges regime.  Changes to pensions and employment law during 2012 -- and much more - are also covered.<br /><br />Here then is a comprehensive reference to the duties of the company secretary and for further research and information, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory information as well as a detailed index at the back which makes navigation easier.<br /><br />If you're a company secretary you're probably already aware of the issues we quote from the following paragraph:  `Should the secretary act beyond his ostensible authority, and without an express authority, the position appears to be that the company will be bound by is acts, but he may be held personally liable by the company for any resultant loss.'<br /><br />`Ouch!' we say.  Which is why we should also say that everyone involved in this challenging role should acquire the latest edition of this excellent volume, post haste!cretary and for further research and information, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory information as well as a detailed index at the back which makes navigation easier.<br /><br />If you're a company secretary you're probably already aware of the issues we quote from the following paragraph:  `Should the secretary act beyond his ostensible authority, and without an express authority, the position appears to be that the company will be bound by is acts, but he may be held personally liable by the company for any resultant loss.'<br /><br />`Ouch!' we say.

B003Y5H5EW|4.0|While the first and second Underworld movies were nicely done and the third gave us some more background history of the war between lycans and vampires the fourth feels lesser then these somewhat. While Kate Beckinsale is back as kicka$$ vampire warrior Selene the overall story for the fourth seems less entranced and dramatic then its predecessors.Still the action effects and characters make it worth watching as well as adding on to the previous Underworld movies before it. All I can say is if you've seen Resident Evil Retribution then expect to feel some deja vu with this movie as well not a lot but you might feel that there's some connection between how the two movies are made and directed...

0374214913|5.0|You fall right into the rabbit hole with this one. Robin Sloan does a wonderful job of setting out the right sort of bait to hook you and follows with such an intriguingly clever story that reels you in and keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens. This clever mix of mystery, the digital world, evident love of books and reading will draw you in and have you trying to solve the puzzle and complete the quest along with the nerdy-rebel of a hero.<br /><br />Clay Jannon's career tanked along with the economy. Jobless, he scours the interwebs and San Francisco for work, unintentionally stumbling upon a rather curious book shop during a casual job-searching stroll. Clay doesn't know what to make of the strange layout of the small shop - the front being filled with your average and expected popular books and the back including stuffed to the gills bookshelves that seem to extend into the dark rafters and beyond, but agrees to follow the rules given to him by the even stranger proprietor, Mr. Penumbra.<br /><br />At first the job seems ideal for Clay - working the 10pm-6am shift, pulling items from the shelf for the odd characters that come to borrow books from the special section, and recording in precise detail the events of the evening - but soon Clay cannot resist peeking into a tome or two or using his understanding of technology to try and bring the store into the present century.

B0091LS07E|1.0|I bought this CD only for the &#34;girl on fire&#34; song and to my surprise i noticed that this cd contains only a slow version  of the same song. I have pre-ordered  this CD and waited for over a week to get this. I have returned the CD already and waiting for the refund.
B000BISBDY|5.0|As so many fine reviewers have already stated, and as Amazon's product description so correctly cheers, this is a special Cash collection. It would be impossible to find a better sounding CD , that's the first thing. And if the goal is to produce a single disk that contains HUGE tracks carefully selected from the totality of Mr. Cash's career recordings, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to do better. Sure, there are sterling moments not contained in this set that I'd love to squeeze in...but the Cash catalog is just too big and too crazy-great to ever expect one disk or even six disks to hold all of the gold. But if you want one absolute diamond disk with incredible sound....as an introduction to Johnny Cash, or as the one disk to own, this is a superb choice.Next, treat yourself to the DVD collection from Johnny's (1969-1971) TV Show. Totally incredible moments with Cash at his best and astounding performances by guests like Kris, Derek and the Dominos, CCR, Dylan, Ray Charles, Tammy, Loretta, etc.. It will knock your socks off. Too Good!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Simple spider games. Easy settings and game play . Great game. Greater thing is that it was the free app of the day.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Amazing he could function and write like he did in that state. I'm glad he learned how to live. A read on the wild side
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game is basic solitary game, but I love it anyway.  you can increase difficulty anytime and I love when the little spider scramble around.
B00338QENI|5.0|I've just finished this book and found myself sitting for a few minutes after turning the last page. I was overwhelmed by the journey Rebecca Skloot had taken me on. It's rare to find a book that's both so fascinatingly informative and deeply heartwrenching. I have nothing to add to the positive reviews that come before mine, but felt I had to take a moment to register my reverence for the experience of this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Outstanding book I think this is the best book. The whole series is great I wish there was more than just 3 books.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Good movie, very enjoyable action movie that had good surround sound audio to it. Looking forward to the confirmed sequel
B000056HOZ|5.0|This dvd set is a must for Springsteen fans.  Purchased it for husband and he watches it over and over.  Very satisfied with the quality of the dvd's.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It a good book but really hard to find stuff in it  over all I give it a 3 stars
B007H7XRLI|2.0|I'm actually not even sure why this is on here.  Maybe someone else bought it?  I don't know, but I wouldn't buy this.
B009JBZH54|2.0|No iTunes codes are available just dumb uv codes that can't be used to please these great movies on your Apple TV. Who wants to watch a great movie like this on a 9\\" screen. No thanks.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This is a challenging and fun game for people to play!  You bag the groceries but nothing heavy on something light!
1419705849|5.0|! well I pre bought this book for $13 and was happy until I saw it for $8 in target,,,o well u get some and u lose some,,,,she'll love it on christnas day no matter what I paid for it....
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so fun!  Slice the fruit but watch for bombs!!  My daughter loves playing this, as do I!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Clever story and very entertaining. I would have liked to see the characters developed a bit more though. The disappearing circus has the same enticing qualities of the story Brigadoon. Others have written long reviews about the pros of this book but I'll keep my review short and to the point. I enjoyed the story, would recommend it to anyone who likes magical stories and I would definitely read other books by this author.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|I don't play this game but my daughter does and she likes it a lot!  I would recommend this to children more than adults!
0425263916|5.0|Can't wait until Sylvia Day completes this trilogy. Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell have a beauty love story that I hope ends well.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is pretty good if you want to know the weather.  Not much animation but it gets the job done!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|It's just how you think it will be- good story, well written, but don't go out of your way to read it if you have ever seen a film adaptation
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds.  My daughter loves Angry Birds.  This game gets a lot of play on my Kindle Fire!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. I love the larger puzzles,  while my grandchildren can work the smaller ones. It is a hit at house!
0780622650|4.0|This was surprisingly hard to find. I was pleased to find it here. A certain sci fi classic. A fun addition to any DVD collection. Will Robinson and Robbie the Robot live on.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|only shows last hour or so of news feed, doesnt have the messenger, would rather use web version than this one! :-/
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Nice graphics.<br /><br />Some items are not clearly defined (it has your search for a mouse, but when you click on a mouse it really means the mouse doll).<br /><br /> When you touch and hold the screen to move it, it counts it as a click which can cause a multi-click penalty.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|hi I love this game so so so much it is so awesome I cant wait to play!!!!!!!I need more words
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|At different times in my life I have read this classic over and over and enjoyed it increasingly. I have seen many of the adaptations and always thought it a bit stogy and rigid. This version has been criticized by some as being a little bit &#34;too down and dirty&#34;. I feel the tone was just right in depicting a class who lost their money and are struggling despite all odds to keep their old life together. The mud outside (it is a farm), walls in need of paint and hanging tapestries sets the tone correctly. Just compare it with Mr. Darcy's estate.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is a delight, but I have seen and become inured to most of her coy mannerisms. I think the interest and a bit of rogueness lies with Matthew Macfadyen. Time shows he literally saves the day and the movie with his passion and loving manner. He is a vital part and is the epitome of the selflessness of a gentleman. I would not change any of the cast. I knew I had to have this movie.
1426308469|3.0|My daughter-in-law requested this book for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter.  I'm anxious to see how it is received since the pictures look a little too real to me for that age.
B004UID2LC|3.0|like that stuff very fun stuff watch it sometimes for hours. Also share with family and frinds. they send head liners too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books are a wonderful quick paced escape from the everyday. Easily accessible and heart warming. I absolutely love this series
B0086700CM|3.0|not really into games that much. but it is ok let the kids play it. why are the number of words required
0439813786|5.0|We found this book quite by accident while perusing the bookstore well before the movie came out. Daughter was 5th grade at the time.  An amazing story filled both with sadness and joy. The book was so good that for a very long time my daughter did not want to see the movie version as she feared it would take away from how good the book itself is.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|Great book love the movie too i love the characters as well very well written one o f the many fantasy books i have read.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Great storyline, special effects but Kirstin Stewart was not the lady to carry it off.  Through the whole movie she looks a though she forgot what she was suppose say or do.  He absent mindness slowed the action down and I lost interest.  I fast forwarded through the movie so I move along.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Read this on my kindle. I was so look engrossed in it it took me less than 24 hours to read it!
B000WDS1OC|3.0|In total I had approx 4 pairs of these shoes because they are so comfortable. I use them every day, but after 2 years they are completely ruined. I only walk in the shoes, never play soccer or go rock climbing with them. Usually the coarse stitchings on the upper front part are ripped and I had to sew them again myself. In the heel area there is a vertical stitch which is ruined after a few months of walking. Usually I dump the shoes when the main stitchings attaching the sole to the upper leater are ripped and the sole i falling off. That cannot be repaired anymore. At the same time, approx., the leather close to the sole starts cracking with the result of large holes. The shoes have always been well maintained with plenty of grease.
B000HIVIOW|1.0|We bought this thinking it would be the same thing as what we had once had on VHS.  This version is not the one with David Bowie (as mentioned by other reviewers), but far worse are the changes made the the \\"Father Christmas\\" story.  It's as if some ultra-politically-correct editor redid the whole story.  Gone are all of the things that made the original version great--the cranky Father Christmas, all of the \\"Bloomin\\"s, and any scene in which Father Christmas (gasp!) drinks alcohol or shows his backside.  It's a really depressing example of how a \\"Holier Than Thou\\" editor can make some many changes to a story that it becomes the opposite of what was intended.  If you want to see the original version, it can still be found in its full length on YouTube.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Nothing was scratched or dented. Good Service!  I Would definately from again!!!! These is our favorite Christmas movie of all times!
1442359315|5.0|Excellent book - for believers and non-believers.  I highly recommend this book, without any reservation.<br />An excellent gift for those facing end-of-life issues.
B00005JGAF|5.0|RAMONES-ROCKET TO RUSSIA: If such a thing as a &#34;perfect punk&#34; platter exists...which goes against the rough grain that defined the genre's very existence...THE RAMONES' third effort ROCKET TO RUSSIA may very well be it. Slathered in JOHNNY's primitive six string slashings, JOEY's soul-papa yelps, and DEE DEE and TOMMY's lockjaw rhythm section, SHEENA IS A PUNK ROCKER's bubblegum bad-itude, the surf-glam sizzle of ROCKAWAY BEACH and a hyperdrive cover of BOBBY FREEMAN's DO YOU WANNA DANCE (all three placed on BILLBOARD's Hot 100 singles chart) gave late seventies radio a much needed kick in the blue jeans. The fearsome foursome's trademark sick humor is all over WE'RE A HAPPY FAMILY, CRETIN HOP and TEENAGE LABOTOMY, while a couple of hook-filled down-tempo ditties (dare I use the term &#34;ballads&#34;?) unspool in cool contrast to their slam-bang rip through THE TRASHMEN's slopbucket warhorse SURFIN' BIRD. Fourteen bone-crackin' tracks scream by like so many mis-guided missiles in a mere half hour...THE RAMONES' fun-filled formula was so blessedly ear-assaulting, irreverent and irresistible, you'll be trying to out shout JOEY on every track.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE ZIPPERS
1451696191|5.0|I just finished reading this book, it is amazing. Very well written. It really made me get into Charlie's life and think about my school.
B008RZF2I0|4.0|Clearly there were some strong tracks on &#34;Ghost Opera&#34; and &#34;Poetry for the Poisoned,&#34; but both releases proved to be uneven and not quite up to the high standard set by &#34;The Black Halo.&#34; AlthoughTommy Karevik was likely chosen to replace Roy Khan given the similarity of his voice and vocal range, Tommy clearly demonstrates much more than that. His vocals are a perfect fit for the Kamelot sound, preserving the overall integrity of the band. The initial video/single, &#34;Sacrimony&#34; is a little misrepresentative of the overall sound of the release, in that it's a little harder track. However, the overall quality and consistency of the release really makes it worth taking the time to experience the subtleties and nuances. Well done Kamelot.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A true story of love. This novel shows how love can help overcome obstacles one may face in life. Absolutely wonderful!
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|This really started slowly and there were times when I wondered why I was reading it, until Geoffrey finally left Africa behind. From there it picked up quite a bit and became steadily more interesting. The idea of hiding some big discovery because humanity wasn't \\"ready\\" is an elitist conceit and more than a little silly. Along with the usual global warming hoorah, though the solution to that was inspired. And Reynolds wrapped it all up nicely in the end with the lingering image of a distant rocket powering beyond the Oort Cloud on a years-long journey to the stars. A good read.
B006VJMZXY|5.0|Philippa Gregory is a author I will be reading more off.<br />Loved, loved this book. History facts and story line intertwined together make for a novel I found hard to put down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many ideas for so many things!  My favorites are quilting,  food and humorous.  I can kill so much time with this!
0307595579|5.0|I always brew coffee reading these books, they seem to drink coffee, ride the subway, have extrmarital sex, and argue a lot.  I have been to Sweden and he missed stylish and beautiful in his descriptions.  Nevertheless, a very entertaining read after the first 100 pages and book two is especially good with some hard to believe moments in the finale.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it's a fun game. I wish it were a little easier to acquire the gems though. I don't like the idea of having to purchase them with real money (it's a game). but other than that, I really like it.
0545405777|4.0|There isn't any numerical series to show it's a collector but it's raw cut pages and old fashioned bind are nice touches to a store that I happen to love. The price was more than fitting and if they were to make one for the other two books in the series I would purchase them as well even though I already own the regular editions. The only thing that really caught me off guard was a larger amount of dried clue that was coming from the top and bottom of the binding when I got it but it is more of a asthetic thing upon opening it, I was able to clean it up and am not out anything to get it done. I say if you are a true Hunger Games Fan or if you just like the old fashioned look this is a good buy.
B0064W65UM|5.0|First of all, I should say I'm not rating the book itself (as in the writing or artistry).  On the contrary, I'm giving it five stars for the quality and functionality of the Kindle version.  As one of the most famous graphic novels of all time, most people already know how they feel about it, one way or the other.  My thumbs up is to Kindle for successfully formatting it into usable, enjoyable electronic media.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|without a doubt, one of the coolest flicks ever. gritty,funny,intense,with a nice ending, Mel is at his best here. Great story and a real down to earth feel about the film. forget all that personal crap he showed due to his drinking issues,etc., this is a back to form Mel in an outstanding little flick. highly,highly recommended, from a major movie/film buff. it's just cool, if you &#34;get&#34; film,and know your stuff,you already own it.

1572814136|5.0|These cards are very nicely done with lots of color and a beginners guide to get started.  A nice, classic introduction to Tarot.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The movies are beautiful and was a really great value. The onlt down side was the paper box that it came in. I wish it was a box that I ddn't think I was going to break.
B002VQ7PVS|3.0|This is the type of book that you read once, having picked it up in an airport lounge and finished on a long ,or not that long a flight.  Read it once and enjoy it, but you never have to go back to it, because there is nothing else there.  A competent craftsman-like book much like one reviewer said, of the Ludlum-Follett school.  I could also like to add Tom Clancy.<br /><br />No, this is not on the same level as a Le Carre, Cumming or Graham Greene, which do reward the reader with an additional reading.  Nothing to get too excited about, static one dimensional characters and an interesting ending.  That said, I may have given it two stars, if I have not purchased it as a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99.<br /><br />No, I don't think that I shall be visiting this author again, unless I am stuck at a discount book store in an airport lounge.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie still holds up nearly 30 years later.  Enjoyed reminiscing and watching it again all this time later.  Glad we rented it.
0345803485|1.0|I could go on and on about how this book is a teenage girl fantasy or a housewifes, who has not had any sex for 3 years... But i wont... just trust me... this book is badly writen, \\"sex\\" parts are not even close to softcore SM... CRAP is one word that sums this book up... I have no clue how the hell this became a bestseller...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As always Mr DeMille does not disappoint. Excellent read John Corey was as entertaining as ever. Can not wait for his next book.
B0091LS07E|4.0|I bought this album because I absolutely love Girl on Fire. Now, I have nothing against Alicia Keys, she has a lovely voice and there's not a single thing I can think of hers that I flat out would not listen to, but I just don't really buy much of her music... this was the one song that really grabbed me and said to me 'I need to own some Alicia Keys.'<br /><br />I was disappointed when I listened to the version- the ONLY version of the song for which the album is named- that was on this album. I gave it a chance, I figured surely it had to be listenable... but I didn't like the addition of Nicki Minaj or the actual lyrics themselves that she was \\"singing\\" (I'm not a huge Nicki Minaj fan under any circumstances so that didn't help, but it wasn't just that it was her). The additional parts just take something away from the song.<br /><br />I am getting awfully annoyed by this sort of marketing by music companies. An album called \\"Girl on Fire\\" should not be released without the main version of the song for which it is named. I was hoping I'd love the version on it just as much, but now, even though I do like a good number of the songs on the album so it was worth the money in dollars versus listenable songs that it offered... I am nonetheless feeling a little cheated because it didn't have a version I care for at all of the song that I specifically~ bought it for.<br /><br />I had to download the song separately because that's the only way I could find it, and I don't see myself ever listening to the album version of the song that I absolutely love.<br /><br />So, lesson learned. My advice to you, if you just want Girl on Fire, download it as a single.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Nothing but political correct  bull$***disguised as zombie fiction. I cannot express how old these kind of things have gotten. All the bad asses are women, the smart ideas are from jews or negros...  No reason why a White man should read this book unless he likes getting dumped on
0525953728|5.0|Although I am a woman and this is probably a good read for men, I found this book gripping right from the first page. I know some parts of this were supposed to be not approved by those in power, but that is not what the Author states. It is an easy read, and I read it in 4 or 5 days.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I got a great deal on this dvd set, which makes it even better. However, even if you are paying full price, I would say the dvd set it worth it. The show is phenomenal and I believe worth multiple watches. I've seen the first and second seasons already, and wanted to have this for my collection as well as to catch up before the 3rd season. Excellent.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Love the antics; the setting; the period and the production. It takes one back to a lost era which shows us how things have changed...for the better I might add.
159514188X|3.0|The idea behind the plot and how the stories are developed are pretty interesting.<br />It builds up sort of too slowly at the beginning.<br />And I find the main character's (Hannah's) language a little annoying.<br />It's unrealistic to me that she would describe things like a novel.<br />Anyhow, it's quite a good book to read.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I love this movie. Not your typical plot.<br /><br />The actors are both very easy on the eyes. Especially a scene where Ryan nearly bears all. ;)<br />Love watching this with my hubby.  We have seen it a handful of times and still enjoy watching it.<br /><br />Watch it!
B009E3EY38|3.0|I am a Led Zeppelin fan so I bought the deluxe edition package. The Blu-Ray concert footage has great audio/video but I do agree with some of the other reviews. They used way too many cameras and outdated special effects. The band wanted to keep the show simple and for the music to speak for itself. But the cameras switch back and forth, and just made the concert seem like a video. The band's performance is excellent beyond the filming headache. The bonus DVD is nothing more than a still camera(far from the stage)recording of a rehearsal of the concert, and an old 1970's footage already available on previous DVD. The two CD's with the music of the concert are no match to the blu-ray sound. Maybe if they go on tour it would feel and look like an actual reunion of the band and not just &#34;one night only&#34; show. I should have just bought the Blu-Ray over the full &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34; package and be satisfied too. Do I recommend the full Deluxe Edition package? Not really.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Simply put, I enjoyed every minute of this movie! Keep things in perspective, then sit back and enjoy! Great cast!
B00A0SQBDM|2.0|I've tried three times now to install this game. It downloads to 99% and then stops. It's as if it never even started downloading. Bit disappointed, I must say. Kinda wanted to check this out.
B009E3EY38|5.0|If you are a fan of this band.<br />This concert is a must to add to  your collection of music
0979019753|5.0|The Miracle Morning Journal is the single BEST journal for success in 2013! I can not wait to give this journal out to all my friends and clients this holiday season along with The Miracle Morning Book! I would recommend this life changing journal to anyone looking to have, do, and be the best version of themselves in 2013!!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|This was no doubt one of the most brilliant movies ever made;  it has become a Christmas tradition in our home.  We eagerly awaited the arrival of the Blu-ray, playing it within a few hours of delivery.  We enjoyed the clarity until the video skipped \\"When Love is Gone.\\"  That song so clearly defined Scrooge's life, and they threw it away.  I don't know why they did it, but I'll hate Disney forever for doing it.  This is like buying a copy of Meredith Wilson's The Music Man and discovering they left out \\"You've Got Trouble.\\"
146500632X|5.0|I ordered this for my step daughter and had it sent to her house (so I wasn't able to physically see it). My step daughter called me as soon as she received it and told me how much she loved it (so I'm assuming it was a great buy)! The calendar was delivered within a few days time.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|If your taste is for matching, and hidden objects, then this game is for you. Haven't tried it on my Kindle Fire but it is fine, if slightly frustrating ly fraught with small graphics. The zoom is OK on my Galaxy S2, but sometimes I am guessing about things as they are a bit small and dark.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The only problem I have with this game is that it is too addictive. It's a great way to relax. Just the right mix of challenge and mental stimulation.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have had my Kindle for a year, and I have to say, that you absolutely get what you pay for in the world of ebooks.  I have never seen so much poorly written, grammatically incorrect and enthusiastically reviewed crap in my life! As far as excellent literature, fortunately, the free classics are a blessing.  I had just about given up on reading anything current on the Kindle when I came across The Night Circus.<br /><br />It is worth every cent, it is wonderfully written, with an original plot and beautifully edited prose.<br /><br />Take my advice, either read the free books, or spend the money for excellent books that have been released in print, edited by professionals and have been reviewed by the pros.  Don't waste your time with the 99 cent, 1.99 or 2.99 stuff (unless it's a daily deal).  Respect your time and yourself by reading books like The Night Circus.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|The original 1982 &#34;The Thing&#34; was better.  This one copied the 1982 plot line.  No real surprises or plot change.  I believe this one is an updated copy of the John Carpenter version.  See for your self if I am right or not.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game! my girls absolutely love it and in truth I adore my this little pony game as well!
B00192KCQ0|2.0|...And this is still one of my least listened to Metallica albums.  There is not one song on my Ipod that has more than 10 listenings.  I guess if there is a gauge for personal tastes as to what is great and what is junk, then that is about as close as you can get.  I have two Metallica toons from my top 25, however one is from Puppets and the other is from RtL.  Its hard to top either of those thrash masterpieces, but the last Metallica album for me that was really worth getting was the black album.  Everything after that is seen a slow decline into mediocrity.

B0051QIGP4|4.0|Most of the songs on this album were awesome, particularly Electric Chapel, Bloody Mary, Hair, etc. But I had to download that terrible SoundCloud application to get them, and that was a hassle in and of itself.

0439023513|5.0|SUCH A GOOD BOOK. I almost never buy books but I was desperate to finish the Hunger Games series. Was not disappointed.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss knows how to put together a book - passion oozes out of him. This book is fantastic. I thought it couldn't get better than 4-Hour Body, which I gifted to EVERYONE for Christmas, but 4-Hour Chef is a damn masterpiece of everything from taste to the big picture of improving your life. We've already cooked some of the recipes, my favorite of which was the MLBJ meatloaf. Holy hell.<br /><br />What I also love about Tim's books is that he tells you his favorite products, the one's he's madly in love with, which make you want to love them too. I swear last year I just paged through 4-Hour Body to come up with all of my fiance's Christmas presents. Same thing this year.<br /><br />I have nothing but amazing things to say about this book and I tell everyone to buy it. It's not a book you need to read from beginning to end, although you won't want to miss a page. I just have to say BUY THIS BOOK, BUY THIS BOOK, BUY THIS BOOK!!
0030839939|5.0|This is a book that fills a gap in the spectrum of texts on solid state physics. Its clear style is very adecquate for introductory courses.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This is a must see movie for everyone. Atticus Finch rules! :)<br /><br />My husband loves this movie! As he lost his hearing four years ago, we are having to redo our classic movie collection as most older movies do not have closed captioning available.

B007PR9R4G|5.0|Love his voice, guitar, and style of music.  A must have for those that enjoy acoustical singing.  A real talent..<br /><br />2/14/13 - so two things, I am so hooked on this cd i listen to it all the time.  Pablo's music is amazing and you receive a cd of the concert that follows the same line up as the music cd.<br /><br />Trust me this is one of the best purchases I have made in music in a long time.<br /><br />jp

B000G8NY4U|5.0|I looked for an adress in google to buy this DVD.<br />I listened it in a travel to other city where live a friend; I was visiting him and I heard YANNI LIVE.<br />I liked it because it's an original DVD and has a perfect soud and I could buy it without go out of my place looking for it.<br />Thanks for sending this wonderful DVD for me. I have been enjoying it a lot.
0425263916|5.0|Loved this trilogy although waiting for last book to be written.  Very similar to Fifty Shades-- A good read as Romances go.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is the kind of book that I can't put down.  This story grabbed .me and would not let me put it down. Great read.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Had I read the reviews of fellow readers, I would not have wasted the time downloading it...at least it did not cost me anything.  As one reviewer pondered, \\"did a teenage girl write this?\\", I must agree.  After a few wasted hours I made it a little more than 30% through and at that point had still not discovered any resemblance of a plot.  However, it you enjoy continuously reading about Ana blushing and chewing her bottom lip, combined with her have an orgasm at every gust of wind, then welcome to it, but don't say later that you were not warned.  I am not a prude and enjoy GOOD erotica, but this falls well below 'good.'  Totally unbelievable.  Peggy Lumpkin, 12/16/2012
B0086449YA|1.0|I've only been able to listen to it a few times and while mark knopfler is a great story teller, the music was just too monotonous and lifeless  to endure. It's very primitive, which I guess is a \\"thing\\" but just too boring to listen to again. Maybe years from now it might be a curiosity but it's not as inspiring as Sailing to Pniladelphia and there is certainly nothing here that would ever be allowed within ten feet of  a Dire Straits album.
0316010669|5.0|I picked this up at the library after reading \\"Outliers.\\" Both were great. Gladwell is a gifted writer and story teller. He's able to tell five stories at once weaving them together to get across one or several points without ever rambling. I found myself reading this for more than 60 minutes at a time without even realizing time had passed. I have become a fan of Gladwell and am anxious to read his other works. I would highly recommend this book for the interested reader. Nothing in it is really ground breaking, but it's the sort of book with a lot of interesting bits of information that make you a little more interesting of a person, a little more aware of your self and others in the world, and give you an enhanced perspective on thinking.
B001IYVUEW|5.0|Wasn't sure if this was going to be good but it's great (as a fan of the 80's movies) that this reimagining can be done with such passion, be different but also be so much more entertaining and enjoyable.  I really enjoyed Bale's performance, even if you don't like his voice.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I got this when it was the free app of the day. I thought it was a hidden object game, which may be vapid but provide idle entertainment when I need something to do. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it's an adventure game similar to Riven or Myst.<br /><br />The story line is very thin compared to the Myst game series, but that series is also more complex and in-depth than any other adventure game I've played, so I don't knock Lost City for this at all.<br /><br />Game played great on my Asus Transformer TF300T. My only complaint in that regard is that it doesn't scale well to a high-resolution display. The graphics are made for a low-res phone display, and the hints list is huge because it appears to expect a phone display.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this game. The only reason I'm not going for five stars is because I wish that there was a hard mode that didn't auto-entry journal items or give any access to the hints, which are really just a direct walkthrough of the game. Part of the fun of Myst and its successors is that you have to figure out what clues are important enough to write down. Having the game automatically do it for you takes something away from the gameplay, in my opinion.<br /><br />I'll definitely try another game from this developer. Very good!
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Starting with the first 10 minutes, this movie grabbed my attention and interest right away.  Really enjoyed it.  I'm usually the type who puts in a movie on a Friday night and falls asleep after a long week at work.  This movie held me in rapt attention the entire time.  Highly recommended.
B008XCM18Q|2.0|I think I first read this in the mid-eighties, and thought it great. Upon re-read, it's closer to a one star than a five. The first 10% of the novel is five star action, then it takes a dive and never comes back. Once the love interest shows up, the prose turns idiotic, the dialogue stupid and sophomoric, and all the supposedly smart characters behave in stupid and irrational/moronic ways. It's like Ludlum just started using cardboard cutouts for characters and imbued them with unbelievable characteristics to push the plot along. \\"I'm the naive but honorable french general!\\" \\"I'm Bourne, who must remind the reader every 5 pages that I'm conflicted via lousy inner dialogue because I can't remember everything from my past!\\" \\"I'm the love interest, who inexplicably decides I'm madly in love with Bourne and he is honorable after he slaps me around and I'm raped, no matter what evidence I'm presented with!\\" And on and on. I was shaking my head at how trite and bad most of the book is from around the 13% mark, and it just kept getting worse. I would rate this one star, but give it two out of respect for Ludlum's name. Oh, and the British spelling on everything (tyre, kerb, saloon for car, bonnet for hood, and on and on) and numerous typos were inexcusable for a work from a big name AMERICAN author via a major publishing house for $10. All in all, I'm extremely disappointed. This is the first book I've ever returned. That says it all.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I bought this for my adult daughter for Christmas.  It came on time in good shape, and I am excited o give her this CD and expose her to a truly amazing era of music.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|please. fix this game. I spent 2$ on it and I cant see a majority of the game. thank you
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was totally not what I expected. In fact, every time I started a new book in the series, I was surprised. Howey is a master of making you think things are going one way, and then suddenly turning the other. The twists and turns had me staying up late several nights, and I got through all five books in shockingly short order.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Always been a fan of these movies from the beginning.  Great set of movies for that odd day in your life.

B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My boys woke up early every morning just to open the next box. The counting of days down to Christmas was very exciting for them.
B00007GZR5|2.0|Just saw this at a friend's home. I always like Robin Williams. I did not know the whole story but liked that its about the afterlife. I did not expect anyone to \\"go to hell\\" for suicide after loosing their children and then later their spouse.  It was a turnoff.  I dont believe those in deep despair are to be jugdged totally by this desperate single action. Its as if their whole life counted for zero and a horrid few months or years of unbearable grief makes them horrible enough to burn forever.  How mean and how silly for US to come to that belief. I think when outside horrors kill one's spirit and ability to go on, that many suicides are not thought out in any way.  And they are very personal..not meant to harm anyone else.  PTSD comes to mind.. loosing all one's family is another. (and the Bible was written by man btw)  Suprised Robin would do this movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I use this video multiple times a week! This is my go to video when I want a great cardio workout. Jillian uses high intensity interval training which keeps you switching things up between cardio and muscle building so it's never boring. This video has three levels, level one is great for beginning working out. If you're just getting back into the groove then buy this video! You can work your way up to level two and then three when you're ready. The moves are quite basic and would be easy even if you're battling with losing a lot of weight right now. All you need are some weights! I use two pound weights, they are just enough to get my muscles working. I have a bunch of Jillian's videos, but this is always my go-to video when I want some cardio! If I really want to workout, but I don't want to kill myself I will do level one, if I am feeling like a really need a beating then I'll go to level two or three. If you're considering buying this video, consider it done!! It's a must have!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|really enjoy this calculator easy to use and love the large display with bold numbers make it easy too read.would highly recommend
B009OCR1X4|4.0|I've collected movie soundtrack albums since I was a kid, I'm now 58 so it's been awhile. The type of soundtracks that I prefer (and collect) are the scores written by composers to fit the film, as opposed to compilations of pop songs. The score for Cloud Atlas written by Tom Tykwer, Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek worked beautifully with the film's amazing visuals. Though it's not in the same league as a score by some of the greats, composers like Bernard Herrmann, Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith it is still a beautiful score. It's an exciting score with little of the bombast that you'll find in many big budget action spectacles. It has classical sounding elements, often mixed with an electronic sound and is at times driving, stirring, emotional and melodic. It's great music to work by.
0425263916|5.0|Loved this book...as much as 50 shades of grey if not better. Can't wait for the third one to come out.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Received on time, with Amazon Prime, no damage or defects! Had been wanting this set since it came out a few years ago on DVD for $100, now I have it on Blu-ray for under $30.  Great deal
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This is a very good book -- serious, funny, heartbreaking, romantic, and so damn well written that I would have to give it five stars even if I didn't like the story. I highlighted so many passages, but I think this one is my favorite:<br /><br />\\" It wasn't that he didn't believe in love. The thought of love was like water in the desert. Now there was a stupid clich&eacute;, one that made him think of a man in ragged clothing staggering through the Sahara, searching for an oasis among the sand dunes.<br />But the Antarctic was a desert, too--a cold desert, one made dry because water there turned to ice the instant it hit the air.<br /><br />So he believed in love. He'd always believed in love. He'd been surrounded by water all his life; it had simply been frozen solid. He'd loved as hard as he dared and watched it freeze before his face. It was no surprise now when he checked his feelings and discovered that he loved her. The surprise was that this time, when he dared to take a sip, he found water instead of ice.<br /><br />He could have wept.\\"<br /><br />I've read all of Milan's books, and this is by far the best. You should read it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|really fun game really exciting and there is always something new to do and I love that it gives me messages when stuff happens
0062183591|4.0|The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty, is definitely a must read. I read this book as one of the required texts for the Forensics Research and Analysis course in Carlow University's M.S. in Fraud and Forensics Program.  As a graduate student, I'm over the top with textbooks I've accumulated over the years but I refuse to sell back this book. (Combined with knowing I'll receive $2.32 for it) I loved how Dan Ariely was able to use the scientific method with his experiments without saturating the book in heavy theory and cognitive /behavioral explanations. Each of the chapters contained the perfect amount of humor, science, and real life examples of how cheating and dishonesty are imbedded in our society.<br /><br />One insight I've learned is that dishonesty is not an isolated event. It's not a behavior that is specific for criminals or \\"bad people\\" which my experience working in the field of corrections has de-sensitized to me to.  In fact, I have about 4 knock off handbags that Ariely described in Chapter 5, Why Wearing Fakes Makes Us Cheat More.  I never saw it as dishonesty but more of \\"keeping up with the trend while on a budget\\" I own replicas of designer's fashion which does not give monetary credit to the original designer. However, I absolutely would never engage in plagiarism which does not give credit to the original author. This book allowed me to make many parallels between things in my own life and I was shocked. Reading each chapter allowed me to gauge my own moral code and I agree with Ariely that people will cheat up to the point that allows them to still feel like a good person.<br /><br />The book is not perfect but it's so worth reading. I could do without the repetition of the same concepts like the Fudge Factor and the SMORC but I understand that it was his way of showing a connection to the material.  As I prepare myself for the field of Fraud and Forensics what I will begin to do as a result of this book is to look closer at the similarities between the behaviors of \\"fraudsters\\" and how everyday people behave. At the end of day, those similarities are scary.een the behaviors of \\"fraudsters\\" and how everyday people behave. At the end of day, those similarities are scary.

048623231X|4.0|I also own the Scenes from the Bible and like it more than this. I haven't read Dante's Divine comedy but I'm planning on reading it. The illustrations are great but an explanation would have made it awesome like Scenes from the Bible.
0553381407|5.0|If you got a mother or no of one this is a great book to get a young or older lady as well
B0085YNML2|5.0|It's similar to many of the other puzzle games out there. Getting past most levels is easy. Collecting all three stars can be quite tricky, however. The variety of flower effects makes the levels more interesting, including spinners, pendulum, canons, and floaters. A good game for puzzle fans.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|should have a digital copy with it. The movies itself is great but buying just a blu-ray movie now a days is a waist of money.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This was actually my first &quot;finding&quot; game. I had no troubles zooming in and out on my Alcatel Authority phone. In fact, my only complaint about this game would be that I got penalties for trying to move the screen around while it was zoomed in.<br />The graphics were done very well, I found the characters (their appearance) amusing and the story was incorporated well considering the type of game. I was hooked for three days straight, the puzzles had just the right level of difficulty to be both fun and challenging, the levels were well thought out and done well.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Almost as good as the whole site.  I keep the app open when I shop in-store and it makes a great on the go ordering experience.

B0053O89WY|3.0|I received the correct product but the wrappings were ripped open and the cover was bent. I was dissapointed because this item was a Christmas present.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun when your bored I really love this game. There is plenty of levels and they do get harder but its fun.
0374214913|5.0|This book caught me by surprise because I had never heard of it before and it showed up on my Amazon recommended books. I read the sample and immediately bought the book. I could have read it in a couple of sittings but I wanted to savor it.<br />It's not an easy book to summarize but I'll try. Clay Jannon has been working as a programmer for a Bagel Company that goes under. He has a hard time getting a job and comes across a bookstore looking for a clerk for the night shift. Clay is intrigued by this huge bookstore, it's eccentric owner, and the customers who come in late. but not to buy books, they take books out from the Wayback Books as Clay calls them, books he has never heard of that cover several stories of shelves, and they exchange them after they are finished. Clay eventually takes a look at these books even though he isn't supposed to and discovers they are all in code. To tell more is to give spoilers that you might not want though are easily available in other reviews. I read this without knowing anything and I want others to have that option.<br />The author uses the love of old books and history and the powerful technology of Google and computers to create a story that is exciting, meaningful, and incredibly enjoyable.<br />It is just one of those books that you want to tell people \\"Read it, you'll love it\\". So yes, just read it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|The first ten minutes of Homeland, Season One thoroughly confused me: a CIA agent (played by Clare Danes) is dashing through the streets of a foreign country, draped in a scarf in order to fit in with the mandate that all women cover their heads, and then she shows up at a prison to breathlessly question a condemned man about the whole point of Season One: is the american POW who has just been found there after something like five years of captivity truly the hero he is being made out to be or is there something sinister going on? Then it hit me (of course): she is undercover, stretching the boundaries and hell bent on not letting another 9/11 take place on her watch. Hooked yet? This series beautifully lays out the possibilities of a rescued POW somehow having been \\"turned\\" or brainwashed during his captivity into believing the USA is evil and should pay for an air strike they launched that killed innocent civilians, including children.<br /><br />It doesn't take long before the truth is revealed (you pretty much know in Episode 1) but you spend the next 11 episodes trying to figure out what Clare Dane's character will do with her suspicions. Add to this that she just so happens to be a CIA agent with bipolar disorder and the real fun begins...especially because she has fought for years to keep it secret. Unfortunately, chasing down an alleged mole who everyone else believes is a hero will bring out the paranoid willies in any manic depressive. I'm into Season Two now and it has just gotten more complex. Enjoy this for what it is: pure brain candy tempting you to commit to one opinion and then you find you have to consider another. You will never truly feel at ease as the plot develops and, if you are like me, you will find yourself sometimes routing for the \\"bad guy\\" who has some major inner conflicts driving him. Worth the money if you missed it on Showtime.

B001P5HI4A|1.0|She is a huge Barbara Streisand fan.  On the other hand, I am not.  But, getting this video is one of those sacrifices you make as a husband.  She probably would be annoyed that I gave this such a low review, but it is honestly how I feel about the movie.  When it first came out in the theaters I went with my wife to see it and I totally fell asleep.  The only other time I had ever fallen asleep in  a theater was when we went to see Reds (Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton).  Anyway, if you're a Streisand fan nothing I could say would convince you that this is anything other than one of her major contributions to civilization.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game to play. my granddaughter. enjoys playing it with me and she can play it by herself.it really keeps her occupied. tiger graphics are great!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a nice solid app. It links well to pintrest and works first time every time unlike some propriety apps. I am just starting to pin and it has helped quite a bit.
B008RTE09S|3.0|I've never seen the footage before, so it was interesting and amusing to see it.  It is kind of odd, but original and that is the way art is sometimes.  I also enjoy the music and the behind the scenes information they provided.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|This is actually a lot better, in my opinion, than Firefox or dolphin browser. Easy to use and lightning fast it's only flaw is the interaction with icloud. If you are fighting your current browser give this a try it is definitely worth a try.

B0098460O4|1.0|The album is pretty bad, but not because of the singers or the selections. Like Susan Boyle, bad mixing and bad orchestral arrangements have been visited upon the pair. That isn't necessarily the kiss of death, because most fans seem deaf to those sins. If the hype is strong enough, J&C may go on to make millions, regardless of technical flaws during the recording process. Along with Simon Cowell, of course, who seems to have no musical taste. They deserve success, he doesn't.<br />PS I still like listening to them-( more so on youtube.com)<br />Being a Engineer/PhD, The recording Engineers job is to make the performers stand out.not create noise like on this recording.. go to YOUTUBE  for better music and sound with these two.---Also remember you can never get true musical notes or overtones on a CD \\"DIGITAL SIGNAL\\" WHICH goes from zero to one only, you can perturbate the CD wave form a hundred million times and never produce a true musical note. But luckily the human ear can filter out the problems with CD recordings Also musical notes must have overtones an harmonics found on tapes an vinyl records to be called HIGH FIDELITY which is impossible on a CD- (Chuck)
B003UYUR0G|5.0|Got this for a pretty low price. Very good movie and a great fan of Jake. If your into movies like Pirates of the Caribbeans. Then you should definitely watch it. 100% recommended for Prince of Persia fans.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I saw this band on Ellen.  I really love their sound.  The lead singer looks like he is going to burst a vein in his forehead when he sings but his range and sound is great.  I listen to this CD all the time.  Even though when I ordered it I didn't realize it was coming from a source in South America.  It took a lot longer to get here.  Read where it is coming from.  It wasn't a boot legged copy but still....

B005LAII12|5.0|Don't let the cute little packaging fool you, this is an over the top fantastic well written and performed movie from the start to the end. It is for Adults only as there are explicit scenes and lots of language not suited for a child. I loved this movie. Watched it On Demand earlier this week and ordered it via Amazon to have in my collection of must see again films. It is really amazing how far the theatre has come, making the character Ted, the little Teddy so alive. Am excited to watch it again over my Holiday break it was that capitivating.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Every song on this CD is great!  It's great that Phillip Phillips got to help write the songs.  This shows what type of music he'll be producing in the future.  Terrific!

B0017O1MIM|5.0|Magnificent restoration again of a classic. Peter O'Toole's blue eyes resemble an ocean pool.  So many classic scenes that it is almost hard to just pick out one, but the definitive is the &#34;dot on the horizon&#34;.  If you are a film historian, you already know what I mean.  Classic movie film score that has transcended all films.

All the talk about CGI and 48 fps and pacing and running time and the inclusion of material from Tolkien's other works is interesting, but the core problem is that the movie simply can't overcome taking about 25 minutes worth of plot and stretching it into a movie running 2 hours and 49 minutes.  It's a shame since there are some sit-up straight moments during those 25 minutes, but unfortunately the exercise doesn't fully succeed.  3 stars.<br /><br />It is a fantastic treat for fans that Peter Jackson decided to return to the world of Middle Earth and explore it a little more.  Unexpected Journey is not an awful film - it's certainly not Phantom Menace, which is what it will likely be compared to by some detractors - but it is not a great one either.<br /><br />For those familiar with the book, the movie covers about a third of it, up to the pinecone tree battle.  Part of Jackson's problem here is that in the narrative, not all that much happens during that time.  More than anything else, the company is more or less just moving around, walking in on random parts of Middle Earth while on the way to visit Smaug.<br /><br />Jackson attempts to make a movie out of this in three ways.  First, he brings in elements of Tolkien's later work, building on the rise of Sauron and what characters from the later books are doing during the Hobbit.  This is actually a pretty reasonable adaptation; the cameos of Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond are worthwhile, and the addition of Radagast is slightly silly but still interesting.  (It also makes for a great inside joke about the Blue wizards for those familiar with what Tolkien wrote.)  Sauron's presence isn't written about in the Hobbit, but Jackson's decision to include how his rise begins here makes sense.<br /><br />The other two ways create more problems.  First, he drastically embellishes the tale ofwhat ends up being a composite of Azog and Bolg from the Hobbit, making him into the main antagonist and creating numerous plot devices around him.  Second, he turns the tangential coming-of-age tale of the overall Hobbit into a direct coming-of-age tale of Bilbo gaining the acceptance of a distrustful Thorin.<br /><br />Most of these latter two story lines come through battle sequences, and the problem is that Jackson ends up filling much of the movie with them.  Unfortunately, this progresses to the point where it the repeated CGI sequences end up almost boring as they merely act as filler for the rest of the plot not advancing.  In doing so, Jackson seems to have missed why adapting the Battle of Helm's Deep as the central plot element in The Two Towers worked so well.  Non-canon characters and story fit perfectly well when they tie together loose ends and advance the main plot.  When they and their battles basically become the main plot as they do for the better part of 2 hours here, any movie would suffer.<br /><br />The saving grace of the movie is the few scenes that do advance the plot.  The one gem in the entire movie that equals the quality with the original trilogy is the riddle sequence between Gollum and Bilbo, where Serkis and Freeman nail the most important sequence in the entire prequel.  If the rest of the movie lived up to that quality, this would have been fantastic.<br /><br />Finally, as far as the 48 fps debate, it's overblown.  The simple way to think of it is like watching a 120 Hz or 240 Hz TV with upconverting and smoothness on; the video quality improves dramatically, but it feels much like watching a video instead of TV.  It's probably worth watching in 48 fps for the novelty of doing so, but not much more than that.<br /><br />Jackson's source material is a bit more robust for the next two films, so it'll be interesting to see what he comes up with.  However, the bottom line remains that if he wants to make a three hour movie, he'll need three hours of plot material next time.  3 stars.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The whole book could have easily been a few chapters, but otherwise what's to write about in the second book then?
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I am enjoying this game but the monetization spoils it a little!  the temptation to buy gems when you have run out would be much higher if you didn't realise that you could easily end up spending a great deal more than you would on some paid for apps.<br /><br />apart from this, graphics are lovely, dragons are cute and the gameplay is excellent!
0470474874|3.0|I would not consider this publication for absolute beginners. Some knowledge required to use this<br />information effectively, otherwise it serves it purpose.
B0085YNML2|1.0|The reviews on this game made it sound like something I'd enjoy, and as the FAOTD I figured, what the heck. Unfortunately on my Motorola Bravo the \\"Loading...\\" screen appears for several seconds and then I'm back at the home screen. :-(
B0064U8GYC|5.0|On the way reading this book, so far I learned a lot without feeling bored. The exercises and sentences are very well constructed so that the readers (newbie, novice, amateur, professional) can understand.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game was very fun and challenging. it is addictive and I could play it for hours and hours. I love this game
B001C4CI8U|5.0|What a great gift for those science fiction buffs who weren't able to catch all the action packed episodes of this great series.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This product does not allow you to quit and return to the homw page. Had to reboot the Kindle in order to get out of the game, I removed the game. In addition the game is not user friendly.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I love a good love story that's rich in content and tastefully done. This reminds me of my parents who were married for 59 years. My mother did everything for her family and nothing for herself. Oh how different her life could have been to have found a Robert Kincaid but then she would have been like Francesca and passed on the love of her life to not hurt my father. I think any woman married for many years could relate to this story. I LOVE the music of Johnny Hartman. His cd sales went up after this film was released. EASY LIVING and I SEE YOUR FACE BEFORE ME are two beautiful songs. Thank you Clint for turning me onto Johnny Hartman!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|nice book,although the audio doesn't follow the book at all times during certain passages. Well written and the book is easy to follow with the audio
B005KELQEU|5.0|This is the second case I've purchase for our family of Kindles.  They are well-padded and protect the kindle well without being too bulky.
B003AWRM9W|5.0|Hard movie to find, not on many store shelves. If you haven't seen it, get it. A very funny movie that adds to my Eastwood collection.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The bulk of the \\"humor\\" in this movie revolves around drug use and adolescent sex jokes (and aberrant sexual behavior--in one scene Ted is caught with multiple hookers visiting, one of whom poops on the living room floor--yes, that was supposed to be funny).  It's unfortunate because the movie has an original and potentially charming concept.  (Think \\"Big\\" with Tom Hanks).  Unfortunately the director takes us to repeated dope smoking, hookers hanging out with Ted, Wahlberg as another mid-30s \\"failure to launch\\" male loser, etc.  Ain't it cool to hang out with your buddy and smoke dope and then show up late for your dead-end job where it takes very little aside from punctuality to be successful.  I'm also disappointed in the star.  Wahlberg showed potential earlier in his career but is now becoming another Steve Gutenberg.  Only his movies aren't as funny.<br /><br />The movie is full of bad language and repetitive toilet humor.  Great concept very poorly executed.  Don't waste your time and DON'T let your kids watch it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I am using the kindle fire and have not had any problems since installing the app a month ago. The game actually runs better on here than online.
B00000FC5H|4.0|Their greatest hits are terrific.  Saw them in person once and they put on a terrific show.  Come back to the &#34;desert&#34; please...
B007VUA7VO|2.0|My HTC widget tells me the important info (how much juice I've got left) in a smaller space, so this is redundant for me.  I actually use it and like it on my iPod Touch though, so this is strictly from the Android perspective.
B009KKLQVS|4.0|i saw this show at the Hollywood Bowl this summer & was looking forward to this video.  when it was released, a lot of us complained that they did not release the whole show.  so i procrastinated about buying it.<br /><br />well, i just recently got a coupon, so i picked bought this finally.  although not the whole show, what remains is excellent & fun to watch.  the audio & picture are both crisp & clear.  as a concert dvd, this is by far the best Beach Boys video.<br /><br />i still wish they released the whole show (it was that good), but i guess this is better than nothing & in my mind the only song i miss is \\"Add Some Music to Your Day\\" without looking at the set list.
B007P6PLDI|5.0|Corgan's remastering of his back catalog has been perfect thus far, except for one song - Plume.  Both the B-side version on the Siamese Dream remaster and the A-side version here are different from the original in noticeable ways, this version moreso than the Siamese one for some reason.  Different lyrics at times, different (almost re-recorded?) guitar parts, etc.  Beyond that, it's all been the way remasters should be done.  And the B-sides on Pisces, appropriately (since Pisces was a bunch of B-sides), are a great set.  Jackie Blue, There It Goes, My Dahlia are all highlights that could've been on proper albums.  I'm still waiting for more of the real old stuff (more Reel Time Sessions and 1988-era stuff in particular), but I can't complain about anything so far.  Except Plume - I'm still wondering about that one.
1419705849|5.0|Another great installment.  My son even expressed the desire to delay the ending, as he didn't want the book to end.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|...it wasn't enough for me to \\"love this movie\\".  I was disappointed that there wasn't more to it, even Depp couldn't keep this turkey from crashing and burning.  The opening sequences were actually kind of good, it gave an interesting back story for the Barnabas Collins legend, but it was the \\"modern\\" day scenes that I found way too silly to watch, I found myself yawning and falling asleep watching the Collins family go about their everyday activity looking more like the Addams Family than anything else.  I did get a kick out of watching the Carpenters singing in a vampire movie, talk about ironic! If the rest of the family could have been as interesting as Depp's character, it might have been a good movie, but the way it came out, it looked like the producers got tired and lost after his introduction to his modern relatives and they just didn't know what to do with the storyline afterwards.  It's a shame, because I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, and feel that he was wasted in this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the screen, memory keys, percentage, just like my handheld. It's easy to use, screen is good size. Great for my business.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I kind of liked this movie.  It wasn't as good as it could have been, but it wasn't bad, either.  Kind of different watching one of our greatest Presidents going around swinging an axe fighting vampires...WOW!  Who knew, that a movie could actually make Abe Lincoln kind of sexy.  This was great watching him learn how to swing his axe because he wasn't much of a gunfighter, but he sure knew how to split logs.  The action sequences were great, I loved watching him swinging his way through that railroad car and through the White House, kicking some serious vampire butt, it makes me so glad that he became our President because now the truth can be told. Abe Lincoln saved the World from being taking over by an army of Vampires!  Loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|a great app. I have played the Pc version an its great to. Good if you don't own a laptop and want to play minecraft on the go!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Lots of action in this movie, I enjoyed it for the most part.  Snow White as an action star...who knew?  Of course, it was really the Huntsman that kept my attention, and his character was a bit unusual for a hero, or as it turned out, one of the heroes.  It completely surprised me that there was no real romance here, was this intentional, or a case of the writers not wanting to go there?  Since Snow White already had her long lost childhood love, who really wasn't a love, as it turned out, most of the story dealt with our heroine hiding from her evil step-mother and all of the things she went through to destroy the lovely Snow White.  Okay, so some of that was a bit over the top, but the action sequences alone were worth some of the slow points in the movie, and it did keep things going.  The one thing that did leave me a bit unsatisfied, though, was wondering, what was going to happen after the ending...who would be the King to the new Queen Snow White???
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Kamelot's new work Silverthorn Limited Edition 2 CD box set is a GREAT set. Box, CD case,story book and poster all very nice.The instrumental CD is not all instrumental. There are ghost lead vocals and harmonies . BUT is still GOOD. The new vocalist is my opinion is better and stronger than KAHN (I still love him too.)WELL WORTH THE PRICE. A MUST have for fans. SONG FOR JOLIE I've played A MILLION TIMES + ADDICTIVE
B001KZG99A|3.0|I like the movie but the movie was stalling during the peak of the action.  It's rebuffing 2 to 5 times.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I love his voice and style and would recommend this to anyone looking for a Christmas CD.Its peppy and fun,
B000AYEL1A|3.0|Movie is good but sooo predictable. Bonus part Streisand talks through the whole movie instead of specific parts...why watch both.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Very good Christmas CD to listen to,,,,I actually enjoy listening to this Christmas music! It is Rod! Again nice twist to familiar songs,
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not a single character to really like, not even much of a story line.  I know it wasn't going to be Harry Potter but really it took forever to read just because i found all of the characters so distasteful.  The only reason i finished it was J k Rowling should deliver a good story.  Well she delivered something something gritty, and not at all like the HP books, maybe she should have stuck with fantasy
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Cheaper than most all-metal led flashlights. I had a mini mag light hanging around and got tired of changing bulbs. This kit was easy to install and is good quality. The bulb is good, the switch is just ok but better than twisting the light on and off.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|Yes, yes I did. It was called mysteryville. Relabeling something doesn't make it new. Same exact app just a lamer story attached. I wish I could do half-assed work like this and charge for it.
030758836X|5.0|WOW! The structure of this novel is beguiling. I got sucked in thinking one thing about the two characters, only to have those thoughts reverse themselves. Amazing characters. This is the best female character in a long while.
B009MO5960|5.0|People complain about how the movies dont relate to the video games but honestly I dont care! If you dont like the movies, DON'T WATCH THEM! Overall I thought it was great! My favorite franchise by far! Cant wait to see whats in store for the next movie!
0374214913|3.0|This book was not about a bookstore or a secret society really or for that matter about computer literate groups. It skipped through all of these and didn't get to the point for me. Maybe I am too stuck in the analog unKindle book world and maybe I'm not a digital native, so I don't get it.<br /><br />The best I can say is I finished it, but I didn't get it.
1451695195|5.0|I've read some of those who attempt to portray themselves as intellectual somebodies but come across as those who are walking through this beautiful world that God created as those who require proof. They, in my eyes, are the exact same people as one who didn't believe, even though he was for at least three years in the presence of God himself. God wrote that he has given them over to their own evils as you can read by his words in the book of Romans.
630471193X|5.0|Probably in the top three of his movies ever. Superior performance, great story, Travolta at his best, fine supporting cast
0553801473|5.0|My review for people who haven't read it:<br />If you liked the first 4, get it.  Duh.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />My review for everyone else for people who, like me, want to read what others think AFTER having read the book.<br />Here are my gripes.  I'm still giving this 5 stars so take them with a grain of sugar.<br />1) Death has less meaning because of the red god.  When Robb died you see it creeping around the corner but when it happens it's still a total stunner, because it is FINAL.<br />But after Dondarrion and Brienne and Catelyn it's kinda like, \\"We'll see what happens.\\"  Perhaps it's by design, but I want to read book 6 because I'm excited, not just to satisfy my curiosity about whether one of the characters is actually dead.  Which leads me to...<br /><br />2) Cliff hangers.  I seem to recall fewer of them in the first couple books.  Sometimes they're ok, other times they feel rather manipulative.  I hated Stannis's story being left alone for A LONG time but it was kinda cool to find out what happened through Jon's eyes through the words of an untrustworthy dude.  That one worked out, but sometimes I was like, \\"OH COME ON\\" and then I'd glance ahead to see how many pages I'd have to wait to get back to that storyline.<br /><br />Aside from that I was pretty pleased and was so involved with the last 150 pages that I didn't savor them slowly and just ate them up.  Like I literally ate them and now I don't know what happened until I buy another copy.  But I feel like the all the negative reviews are just missing out on a lot of good stuff in these books, and much of it is between the lines. He shows people and their foibles.  What's it like to be a normal dude who is heir to a great kingdom (Quentyn)?  Or the subtle setup for Jon's fall?  He did make a bad call, a call which I was excited about until he paid the price for it.  But I think his isolation pushed him to that decision, and it was an isolation that was hinted at for hundreds of pages.  It's cool stuff and just amazingly crafted at times, but if you're just waiting for some big dragon battle you're going to miss out on all the little things that give that battle meaning.<br /><br />Anyyyyyway.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|Tried to install but continually received error message asking that I try again which was pointless because message just popped up again
B00867GJYK|5.0|I love Finding Nemo so much that I had to import it the moment I could (there's no release date for the UK).<br /><br />The blu-ray quality is astounding, so much detail absolutely everywhere - the bits floating in the sea, the scales on the fish, the water effects. Everything looks amazing.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It was fun to watch this &#34;princess&#34; movie with my granddaughter.  It definitely is not your typical &#34;princess&#34; movie.<br />I think it's good for girls to see this more assertive role as a model.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Beautiful watch. Bought it for myself, but the wife loves it and it also fits. A bit bigger for a ladies watch, but still a good fit.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but it was very easy to down load on my kindle and can't wait to read it.
B00081912E|5.0|MY favorite movie! I have watched it at least twice a week if not a day. Jim Carrey is so funny and perfect for the Mask!
B008XG1X18|5.0|A must have app for your Kindle. You could spend hours looking at this, and so easy to use on the Kindle. Be sure to mark it as your favorite.
B004I744AS|5.0|I have tried a multitude a wonderful dictionaries, including Google translate , the free dictionary, RAE, etc, but without any room for doubts this one is simply stated &quot;the best. &quot;  I'm deleting all others. This is ALL I need. It contains all in one and more. Thank you so much. Now I don't need to keep switching between dictionaries, translators, and thesaurus.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I am really enjoying this app.  Find it to be easy to zoom in and out-saw reviews stating was difficult but I haven't had any issues. Am planning on buying more apps from this.
B0017PD2J8|5.0|very touching and powerful. Frankl demonstrates how to find meaning through the most unimaginable suffering, and he comes out with a very positive outlook on life and humanity.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this Tocantins hair salon is WAYYYYYYY better than the first one! Totally worth it! I was playinit for hours! Must Bye
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this box set when I received a email about it for 25$ At that price you cant go wrong and the packaging design is great. The only problem I had was I bought this around 12PM and when i got my confirmation email back I checked the item and it was selling for 20$ all of a sudden. I had to spend hours trying to get amazon to give me back the difference in price. Apparently they don't price match their own prices even if you just bought the item 30-60 minute earlier. I did get a &#34;one time exception&#34;, but the process was very frustrating and I would urge anyone making purchases through the email notifications to double check the pricing before making the final purchase or you could be out a lot more than 5 dollars. Overall the Anthology pack is a great buy even at its normal price.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love itI love itI love itI love itI love itI love itI love itI love itI love itI love itI love it<br /><br />Oh yes it was good!
B009X010RU|2.0|It is alright, but I was hoping the case would give a bit more protection. What I do like about it, it has openings where you need to plug in to charge it. It also has openings right behind the speakers. There is a elastic type band to make sure it does stay closed when it is in your pocketbook.<br />What I don't like.. the part that is the stand, is not always sturdy..and it often slips out of the wedge.
B0085YNML2|5.0|THANK YOU for *NOT* asking me if I &quot;really want to exit&quot;!!! If I Hadn't *wanted* to Exit, I wouldn't have *tried* to Exit!! So Stop *asking* if I want to exit, all you other idiotic developers!<br /><br />As if the game wasn't already good enough, *instant* 5 stars for not asking me if I want to exit. The world needs more developers like you, Gamistry. ;-)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A fun, well acted movie in a beautiful/interesting location. We really enjoyed it.  You can never go wrong with this cast of actors.

B002PMV9K6|5.0|Harry Potter is the greatest story ever told. Movie is outstanding to watch, excellent actors, excellent storyline, excellent product. Wonderful.
B007SPPANM|5.0|It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again... i bought it as a gift... it's a classic for the ages
B000W74EQC|5.0|Can't believe I had to wait until now the watch the best entertainment in history.  The story line, actors, screen play is just fantastic.  Haven't been this entertained in years.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult has a way of tugging at your heartstrings the way no other author does. I wanted to laugh, cry and rage at this book. It doesn't make sense the amount if emotion I donate to her books. Cannot wait to read all Mrs Picoultd books.

B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I love this type of book. It explains why we follow certain patterns. Then provides simple rules to change those patterns.
B000W796OM|5.0|Harry, Ron and Hermoine just keep entertaining us with their antics. Kids and adults alike watch and wish they also could live an enchanted life like these movies.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent read. This was one of those books that I read every free moment I had. I hope there is more to come from Silo 18!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I was blown away by how good it was... expected it to be a bad B movie but was happily suprised it wasn't... the special effects will blow you away... a totally worth while movie to watch.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|It was great... story was a little different than the original Snow White but that made it even better... special effects were awsome and I especially loved the bridge troll facing off against Snow.... a must see on my list.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Got tired of my wife having me rent this movie, now she can watch it anytime.  It came brand new and is just what she wanted.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|With excellent special effects and funny conversations, not to mention the dog like creature that likes John Carter and won't leave him once they meet... the movie is funny and worth watching from time to time especially for the kids...
1451695195|5.0|I just finished reading [[ASIN:B00AAJG59Q Master of the Realm]] by Valentine deFrancis, which not only was an amazing story, but has gotten me to believe in life after death. So when Proof of Heaven came out, I decided to read it, which is something I never would have done. I believe his story and I hope that others will open their minds to the possibility that life after death exists.

B00701L5XS|5.0|I received this app at no cost, otherwise I wouldn't have it. That said, upon opening I spent a good hour entranced with it; watching the animations of knots being formed, read the histories and explanations of use, critiques, comparisons... it's all quite interesting!
B002QS5OQ4|3.0|Excellent idea but too dark and none of the characters had.. well.. &#34;character&#34;.. everyone cheated on each other, no one could be trusted, no one was really that likable. More reality and less fantasy. Not for kids or teens.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very happy with this app. Easy to learn and set up. It has a lot of features that are very helpful.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. This was probably the best season for this series.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|There is nothing better than a rainy day and the Alien Anthology. Hours of gory fun ;-), snuggled on the couch and popcorn on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing better.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Bought it to have when Grandchildren ages 10 and 5 came to visit prior to Christmas.  We had watched it last year.  Still a great movie with a great story.
B004JMY312|5.0|This is another movie that I feel should be around every Halloween.  It's definitely funny and entertaining.  My pre school age children were very attached to the talking kitty cat and shared a bond with him through the movie.  I've always loved the story and magic in this movie!
1939416019|5.0|I just downloaded this on my Kindle yesterday morning and just finished. I loved the story line and Thor! I can't wait for book number 2. Great job Morgan Rice.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent story telling. I can't wait to read the third part of the trilogy. I could not put the book down
B0085YNML2|5.0|Love the mechanics, character is cute, simple but deep gameplay. Very solid job by the developers. Level difficulty ramp is perfect.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I don't get y everybody is saying they don't like it because itnis actually really fun!  u should really get it!  don't listen to allnof the other nasty comments
6305428042|5.0|you sent it in good time I love the movie the quality of the DVD is good and thank you.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|I have such fond memories of Abba as a child and even now as an adult I am still drawn to their music. I bought this particular one because it has Adante on it, unlike the &#34;Best of&#34; or &#34;Abba Gold&#34;.  As soon as I received it I popped it in my car CD player and started enjoying on my way home.  Couldn't be happier.<br /><br />One drawback...it would have been helpful to include instructions on how to remove the CD from the case.  For those like me who might have a problem...you need to smash the middle section that seats the CD in the case. I thought it was upside down because I struggled to remove it not knowing that there was a security mechanism.  Try not to totally destroy it though, because it still needs to hold the CD in the case.
B0085YNML2|5.0|In the tradition of so many other chomp style games, but this one brings color coding to the table.  Fun game when you have nothing else to do.
B000093FLA|3.0|I enjoyed most of this film even though I had to guess what was going on.  I actually rented this on Netflix and tried to watch it at least 3 times before finally giving in and just putting up with the speech in it.  I understood only about 40% of what was being said. The accents are horrible and I could understand nothing Brad Pitt said. The plot was confusing enough but when you add in the fact that you can't understand the dialog, it makes you want to give up on the movie.  However, there are some funny parts in it and I think I caught the general idea of it.  I may at one time rent the actual DVD so I can run the subtitles and appreciate the film more.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is one of my FAVORITE Christmas movies.  It's both wonderfully uplifting and at times bittersweet.  Definitely a wonderful date moviet
B00969PR18|1.0|if you enjoy resetting you Kindle then download this app. The promise of downloaded, off line maps is good but the app had to be stable.
B000UPQFEA|4.0|The EMI discs sold poorly when first out, Rattle was relatively unknown. There is some of the freshness in these recordings.<br /><br />The whole set now is available cheaply. Based on symphonies 3,4, 6 and 7 I rate it as high as Davis and higher than J&auml;rvi, a bit below V&auml;nsk&auml;. Recordind sound is fine. I have the whole box now and the extra disc Philharmonia Orchestra 5th is worth the box, 5 stars for that. Rest is 4-5. You get two 5th symphonies.<br /><br />Rattle continued as Sibelius conductor in Berlin. Expect to see another cycle when the classical industry recovers. And the world economy.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|My 3,2, and 1 year can't stop dancing during this movie! Their favorite of all the chipmunk movies. Highly recommend !
B002VPE1AW|5.0|A favorite of my entire family -- probably the most beautifully rendered movie ever.  Spectacularly beautiful scenery - like art in motion.  Great action sequences.  And a beautiful story of love, loss, heroism, and the very essence of life.  Spiritual.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great characters and wonderful story line completely unexpected , it got me interested and made me fall in love with Gideon, crossfire always has the best novels
B0085YNML2|5.0|i love this game!! super cute and entertaining!! it inspired what im getting for my friends christmas present this year! (the chameleon reminded me that she loves frogs so im getting her one:) )  super cute game and how can it get any better when its free??? buy buy buy!!!!!

B005LAJ16I|4.0|made to seem slightly possible ,unlike NCIS and all the other joke crime  shows that are beyond reason.hope it continues
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Discovered him in the movie Searching for Sugarman. Great film and wonderful music. So glad the documentarian found him and let him be known to the world again!
1451620829|5.0|I would say that I underestimated Peter Criss's Sex, Drugs and Rock N Roll lifestyle. He lived to extremes on all accounts and strikes a great balance as far as talking about all three things. Excellent all the way through. I was repeatedly blown away with nearly every chapter.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Discovered him in the movie Searching for Sugarman. Great film and wonderful music. So glad the documentarian found him and let him be known to the world again!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the greatest shows that ever was and I am not a huge Joss Whedon fan. If you have not seen this show, you must watch it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I will definitely read it again in a month or so wen I forget the plot. I recommend all readers to read this book.
0345451325|5.0|Very good book about the pre-video game Halo universe. If you're a fan of the game, then this is a must read.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Liked Other bourne Movies Better.....Not Much Action.Did Like motercycle chase. Movie was slow at times Hope they make another movie with the other jason bourne.
0757302661|5.0|I used the Hypnobirthing method for the birth of my son and it works! I cannot stop talking about how wonderful it is!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I got the item in a swift and timely manner.  It made a great gift and we enjoyed watching it again together.  It was just as excellent and fun as the first time we saw it in the theature.  My parents thought it was a blast too!
0765316897|5.0|If you're looking to purchase this book, then you've probably already read the first two, so there's not too much I can add. Read the trilogy and love it. I did.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a very fun game with all of it's twist and turns. Mini puzzles are fun. The game is challenging and the graphics are unbelievable.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|When I 1st received this it would just play halfway and than lock up. So I use another player and it played fine in it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I Knew this is A game I would like. It is exactly what I expected.<br />yes there are ads, but it's go be expected with a free app.
B008TT7CXW|4.0|This is an excellent carrier for SD and Micro SD cards. It holds the cards securely and fits well into the pocket of my Nexus 7 cover. I thought it was a little expensive for what you get but it does the job.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|Regular advices. My wife and I followed the book insights, but didn't get good results. Overall, a book well written, but no more.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Oh my goodness, I love this movie... I have watched it over and over so many times and each time I cry so hard... This is the most tender story about the love of a dog for his master... Everyone should see this..
B008ASLK8A|5.0|The second installment of Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Jr. in the lead is equally as good if not better than the first movie. A little less humor and a little more action still I like this cast and look forward to another if they choose to continue the franchise.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book and didn't want to put it down, however, I was shocked by the ending and it made me like it less.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|All I can say is kudos to PBS for bringing this wonderfully written, skillfully acted and visually stunning program to America.  This is the story of an aristocratic family and their staff during the transition from Victorian times to the roaring '20s.  Life is changing fast and people upstairs and down are having trouble keeping pace.  This is not stodgy or overly romantic.  It is compelling and engaging.  I love the way the story is driven by characters in both sets of people, the aristocrats and the working class.  I love seeing the amazing house.  I also love being able to get a glimpse of what it may have been like to live in a time when electricity was new, there was no television and women were occupied with changing their clothes 5 times a day.  BRAVO and keep the episodes coming!
B000N3ST9I|5.0|And in doing that, they have created in my opinion, one of the best metal albums in the past 10 years, I loved Through the Ashes of Empire a lot, but I still saw some room for them to improve, it took them 4 years to complete this, and when you listen to it, you can see why, this is epic thrashy death metal, with some excellent melodic parts, it will remind you of Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, they really mix all of those influences with this album, so yes, this album is very diverse, and they really craft some long songs that don't get boring because there is so much going on, and I'm not one for super technical metal, I do like technical metal, but I find some bands try to take it to far, Machine Head did not, because while it's very technical, it's still aggressive and angry, which I really like.<br /><br />Rob Flynns vocals are the same as the old days, BUT, he has added a clean sound to his vocals, and he sounds great, he does a great job of going back and forth between the harsh and clean sounding vocals, and he's always been an excellent guitarist, but this album really shows his talent, the leads and rhythms flow nicely, and him and Phil Demmel really go off each other very well, great leads, hooks, and thrashy riffage, and still maintaining those Pantera-esque sqeals like Dimebag used to do, which MH was always known for, but they've figured out how to use them better with this album I feel, as it's not over done, and the solos that Rob and Phil come out with just absolutely shred, like I said, these two trade off solos, leads and rhythms very well, and with this album, they had their stuff together.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this album is the drumming, Machine Head always managed to have great drummers, and this guy is no exception, excellent double bass, excellent rhythms, and every note is hit to perfection, and it's not one dimensional, double bass one minute, slow grinding rhythms another minute, and I like the tone, the drums are mixedperfectly, not too loud, but definetly there.<br /><br />The production is another thing about this album, it has a nice loud sound, but it's not over produced, which I feel some bands have a tendency to do, especially when it comes to metal, it should sound raw, but not to raw, this album falls right in the middle, Colin Richardson has always been an excellent producer anyways, Machine Head has worked with him for quite a while now, so they've found their guy.<br /><br />The album cover is nice too, very surreal.<br /><br />So this album is definetly one that every metal fan should check out, it should have everything you'd want, because theres a lot of elements here, now the song lengths may not be for everybody, most of them are 6 minutes plus, but they do not get boring, because like I said, theres a lot going on with each song, so they keep it interesting.<br /><br />Best Metal album if 2007? Yes, I do agree, buy it!
B007MJKOY4|3.0|The movie just didn't do it justice.  It's a bit plodding and many of the details are difficult to catch.  If you just can't find the time to read the book, then watch this, but if I think you will be much more satisfied if you pick up one of the greatest novels of the Cold War.
B00632HWOG|1.0|this used to be a great app: quick and easy. I installed the update and tried to get my mail. All it does is spin. spin. spin.
B005SAP45I|4.0|The characters from Cars are all back.  The movie is entertaining and enchanting.  You just can't lose with this one.
B00AMBMF1Y|4.0|Amy Adams owns her role and is totally convincing. Justin Timberlake has been fairly mediocre in his acting career thus far, and is given just enough of a role in combination with good directorial coaching to perform adequately; how much of this is based on him virtually playing himself is questionable. Eastwood's roles are something of an enjoyable cliche, but he goes on to show a lot more emotional depth than was evident in Gran Torino. John Goodman is also a welcome face.<br /><br />I have no knowledge of Amy Adam's baseball expertise, but she sells her role expertly. She seems genuine at all times, something which is difficult and rare when you are selling an artificial expertise you don't own (guessing that regardless of any baseball knowledge she has, that her character is on the extreme end of that) Example are special forces soldiers in movies who don't know how to handle weapons and speak jargon and regurgitate dialog that anyone associated with the infantry or spec-ops community would laugh at.<br /><br />The plot develops evenly, the characters seems to change as the plot progresses (perhaps because many of the scenes were shot in order), and the resolution is satisfying.<br /><br />On the whole this is a pretty good movie, not a great movie, but pretty good one. The film ended and I was left satisfied; there were no loose ends to tie up, and no feeling that something was missing.
B005MLZPLQ|5.0|Okay, there are people who will never get over that a woman is playing a role that was written for a man, but really, when it's Helen Mirren, how can you go wrong?  I love this play and I love this movie, but it is a different telling than the original.  It is still magical and the language sings.  It might not be for everybody, but I truly enjoyed it.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|I love hidden object games & who doesn't love Christmas!!  This game is great, not too hard & very funny.  Enjoy it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It isn't as compelling as the first, but it moves the story along.  Our heroine faces more challenges and must rise to the occasion as the District champion.  How will she handle being famous?  Will she become like her mentor?  Whom does she really love?  Can she handle the pressure and still save her district, her family, her closest friends?  What revenge will the government exact for having outsmarted them at the Hunger Games?  Read it... it's good.
B004RKSAU6|5.0|I had just finished reading Dearie, and felt that I needed to have a copy of the original printing of this classic cookbook.  It arrived promptly and in good shape.  It is everything I expected it to be given the detailed account of the years it took to finalize it for publication and all of the incredible hard work and energy Julia Child put into it.  I have used a couple of the recipes so far, and love the way they are so detailed and step by step.  It really is hard to go wrong!  I look forward to trying out several of the recipes, and feel confident that they will meet high expections.  I know this will be a book that I treasure and pass along, most likely to my daughter.
B005GIS2UQ|1.0|Obviously, I did not like this movie at all.  It is crass humor with no plot and... well it's just awful with no redeeming qualities.
B002RSDW80|3.0|This film is, somehow, neither fish nor fowl.<br /><br />The premise isn't bad, and the Julia Child memoire portion has genuine bio-pic interest.  Yet, overall, the script isn't strong enough to carry a two hour film, and the one-note point of the epic effort to make all of the recipes in a single year - itself rather admirable, and clearly an act that ends up being an homage to Ms. Child even if it didn't necessarily start that way - just doesn't have quite enough meat to it.  The scenes in Paris make you want to go there.  The sets are quite beautiful, as is the food.  The script relies on many cliches.  The dialogue is sometimes rather stiff. Meryl Streep's impression of Julia Child is a hoot at times, at other times somewhat forced.<br /><br />The film is informative.  It is in some ways uplifting.<br />In the hands of Neil Simon it could have been informative, uplifting, and funny.
B006INDMEE|5.0|This isn't your average Nazi-hunter thriller.  The plot has twists and turns that are unexpected.  The dialog is realistic and the characters are believable.  I watched this with my kids (older kids- teens), and we all thought it was good and thought-provoking.  It has inspired some really great conversations on ethics and personal morality.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I would spend a week playing this, but you run out of of coins and have to wait 30 sec and lay again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this in a half a day it was a great read. Love how hard the characters worked on their relationship, and the fact that they both have major issues is simply captivating. I recommend this book. It's better than the first and I can't wait for the next one; and the sex scenes are HOT job well done!!!
B004ZJZPWA|5.0|My recent purchase of Van Helsing was exactly what I was looking for.  Not only did I get the blu-ray disk, but it also included a digital copy so I am able to watch it on the go!
B00846REIS|4.0|Thanks a bunch to the latina looking lady than was on the A train in New York who recmmended this book,I love it. My first time read by this author definitely not my last. The characters are just full of drama,and the insecurities of the main characters are out of this world and the cave man attitude is just to die for,they think sex is the answer to their problems. after reading this book, you willfind your signifficant other and rock their world. Just buy the book you will see what I'm talking about
B0085YNML2|4.0|The other reviews that say this is similar to cut the rope, are correct. Get your lizard to the grub so he can eat, and your good to go. The spinning flowers are funny to watch your lizard spin, but so far, the game is almost to easy (the reason for only 4 stars). If it becomes more challenging, I'll adjust my review. Over all, it's a fun game.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|I was expecting to be blown away with this CD, especially considering all the 5 star ratings.<br />It was a very disappointing CD for me, pretty mediocre.  IMO he lacks power and soul in his singing, and actually has a pretty weak voice.<br />I bought it based on the overwhelming rating here, and I know I'm in the minority (???) , but I sure wished I had watched his TV special first.  Then I certainly would not have purchased it.  His guests blew him out of the water.<br />(even the late Bing Crosby - a big mistake to sing White Christmas after him!!)<br /><br />I'll keep looking for that knock-out Christmas CD!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|AWESOME<br />IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW THEN BUY THIS BOOK. If you don't watch the show then you should. Enjoy
6305428271|5.0|Michelle Pfiffer did a wonderful job. Ive seen some of it but not all of it. I thought that this was a good movie. It left me on the edge of my seat.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am a fan of J.K. Rowling. I was used to her plots in the Harry Potter series. I was surprised to note the interplay of Sex and drugs in the storyline. It was an interesting story involving smalltown politics and the interactions of several people. From the way the story played out, I'm not so sure how \\"casual\\" this vacancy on the Pagford City Council was. Every part of it was interesting<br /><br />Structurally, It seemed to me that the book wasn't quite in its finished form. I read this book in ebook form. The lack of page numbers and chapter Titles sometimes made it feel like I had lost my place. I don't know if this was the format for the printed version. I guess I have been spoiled by all of her Harry Potter books. I liked the way they were layed out.<br /><br />Will I keep looking forward to reading J.K. Rowling titles? Yes.
0345803485|5.0|All 3 books just blew me away. Ana and Christian are my 2 favorite people. I couldn't put them down. I loved all 3 of them. Now lets get a movie going!!!
B004SDEP38|1.0|I wouldn't even call this a stripped down version of the program. All it does is give you a read only file with no way to save, or edit it. All of the other functions are locked and you CAN unlock them by purchasing the full version for $14.99. Anyone that gave this a 5 star rating was obviously touting the full version, not this extreme minimal one
0425263916|5.0|I thought that the 1st one was very good. The second one blew me away. I can't wait for the 3rd one to come out.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The movie was great.  Daniel Craig has made his mark on the franchise and so has Judi Dench.  This version has more depth and plenty of darkness.  Javier Bardem was perfect.
B009329ZF2|4.0|A fun way to spend an evening with a bowl of Popcorners! I enjoyed this movie in the tradition (though not same quality) as Transformers....don't over analyze, over think, just sit back and enjoy.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I love it! Adam Lambert is my Idol! I adore him & his music! I am a huge fan and have been following his career since 2009.<br />I have already recommended this CD to friends & family and some have purchased it although I'm not sure if they bought them online or in stores.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Having made my first entree into the DAC world with the FiiO E7 due to the fact that I work in an office with a crazy boss that spends a good portion of the week screaming at his employees investing in a DAC to accompany my AKG 550's was a requirement for survival.<br /><br />After spending some time getting the cans warmed up and the E7 broken in I decided to give the E9/E17 combo a run at home where I have them connected to an iMac.<br /><br />This combination has provided endless hours of escape so far and I am certain will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />As long as you have a decent set of cans to enjoy this with don't hesitate just pull the trigger on this one!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this app is awesome. I think I am upsest with it though but its amazing I really hope you love<br /> it too
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Johnny Depp and find him to be an immensely talented individual that slips into characters as if he were wearing a finely tailored suit.<br /><br />With that said this dark comedy provided my wife and I an entertaining movie night and I do not regret purchasing this dvd especially as it was on sale at the time of purchase. I will say that this is yet another movie that I am glad I waited for the DVD rather than paying the unbelievable costs to visit the theatre these days. Had I shelled out $40 or more for a night at the theatre to see this I would have been very disappointed but for less than $10 it was a steal!
B004SIP9RO|5.0|funny and gives me that warm fuzzy feeling i love in movies like this! probably my favorite john cusack movie.
B005LAII08|5.0|Another awesome Pixar movie and a must have addition to any respectable collection for movie loving father...go on just buy it!<br /><br />best deal I could find and when combined with Prime shipping were a simple  no brainer...after all if you aren't satisfied returns are a breeze.<br /><br />Thankfully I have rarely had to exercise that choice but when I have it has been painless....how to regular stores stay ni business these days when I can sit here and order what I want, have it in my hands 2 days later? No brainer!
141659521X|5.0|I thought this was another great Mitch Rapp novel in the series.  This book takes up back to current times after the pre-quel \\"American Assassin\\" and \\"Kill Shot.\\"  I thought this was a very good story and I enjoyed the twists and turns Mr. Flynn puts in his books.  The detail is also great!  This was a definite improvement over \\"Kill Shot\\" and I look forward to the next edition in the series.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I'm in genuine awe. Just like the master painters of old, Emily Bronte is a master of the imagination, putting pen to paper and creating a legend.
0545259096|5.0|Purchased for a Christmas present for someone who reads a lot of books and wanted to have this in her collection.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan,  You'll  just love it.  Cost performance is vey good.  Incredibly reasonable.  I recommed to Beatles fans.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|A+ We Love it!  Gets more challenging as you play! YOU SHOULD TRY IF YOU HAVE KIDS OF ANY YOUNG AGE!  My 5 year old son loves it as well as 8yr old and 4yr old niece
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Love this movie. It's one of Disney's funniest cartoons--and,  best of all, no princesses! I'd recommend it for almost any age.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I recommend this movie. This remake was very well done. The suspense and drama and effects are excellent. I enjoyed it a lot.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|A bit on the boring side. You find out a few things about the man and there are some good things about this movie. It was ok.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I got this for my brother in law since he enjoys puzzles and i was so excited to find this. when i finally received the package i was worried that the product was damaged. the package was falling apart and ripped open on the bottom cover in something black that i had gotten all over my hands. i was really disappointed with the shipping. i would have rather of gone to the store  to look for this knowing that this is how it was going to get handled. love the product, really upset about how the box was damaged while shipped!
B002ZG997C|5.0|This is a great movie. I highly recommend it. Denzel Washington does a great job of acting in the movie. The story is exciting with lots of action for action junkies.
141659521X|2.0|Just not very compelling.  Not enough Rapp and too much Kennedy. Vince can do better. He has done much better.  has to work hard to keep up with Daniel Silva, or if not he will lose many readers
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it she always asks to watch the &#34;bear&#34;. She is so cute she sits and watches the whole movie at a little over 2 years old.
0307951529|5.0|This is a great book! It is a easy read with very practical advice. I highly recommend it to anyone who is considering a different path and they aren't sure how to go about it or need some inspiration to get started.
B00004XQ83|5.0|My mother loves this movie and lost hers.  This was a replacement.  She is very pleased. The movie arrived very quickly.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Increased resolution and sound adds to the enjoyment of a superb sci-fi anthology.  I have watched the DVD version several times, and the Blu-Ray version deserves multiple views.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm excited that I can browse Pinterest on my Fire! Larger screen than my phone &amp; much more portable (&amp; lighter!) than my laptop. Quick accesses to TONS of ideas on just about anything; including  crafts, fashion, cooking, home decor and humorous quotes.
B005LAII08|5.0|I love this movie.  It isn't your typical princess movie and has a great moral to the story.  Disney did a great job with this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definitely read this book. Very addicting to read, didn't want to put the book down. Wanted to read at work it was so addicting.
B004HX4RT6|3.0|an ok game if you want to learn chess! it was free, i want tot try to learn but i gave up,
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Legos are so freaking cool. I'm almost 40 and I can remember the legos I had as a kid and they sucked compared to those of today. We didn't have all the themed legos like Ninjago and Star Wars and Harry Potter and Dino and City. Come on. Everything is so cool these days. I love that my son collects legos because I can live vicariously through him. This bike is just one more awesome lego in the entire Ninjago set. How fun would it be to be on the creative team at Lego and come up with this stuff?
0143119680|5.0|A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES by Professor Deborah Harkness of the University of Southern California sometimes reads like a text book but of, my friends it is so, so much more.  A terrific first book in the All Souls Trilogy.  The book introduces us to daemons, vampires and witches who have lived with humans throughout history, and a history lesson we get on these beings and there interaction with humans and each other.  I haven't been drawn into a good multi-book fantasy in a long while and I am very pleased with this one.  A rich deep story with great characters and a complex story.  Dr. Diana Bishop, a witch with unlimited powers she has never tapped, falls for Dr. Matthew Clairmont, a vampire, while visiting Oxford and this intense love story about forbidden love drives the book.  It is a serious read not always light but well worth the effort.  Cannot wait for SHADOW OF NIGHT, book two.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this a great app for passing time and for more than one person. I don't like the pore controls.
B005DOKK7Q|1.0|It does not fit my Kindle Fire. It is to small and Kindle is much  larger than the sleeve, thanks
B004LROUNG|4.0|I read this book in less than two weeks. It was easy to read and a fun story of breaking out of the oppressive environment of a large company and finding your own way.
1451675046|5.0|Dr. Dawkins has done it again.  This is an incredibly clear, delightful, entertaining, and educational romp through the garden of modern ideas about Life, The Universe, and Everything.  In his effort to avoid using jargon and turns of phrase which might make this book too strenuous a read for younger readers, Dawkins has managed to escape the danger of condescension. The result is both enjoyable and informative, providing much needed support for young \\"Doubting Thomases\\" in their inevitable verbal confrontations with their faith-addled friends.  I wish this book had been available when I was a teen attempting to explain my worldview to my Jehovah's Witness-indoctrinated friend.  He kept anxiously looking up at the sky in anticipation of the lightning strike which never came to punish my blasphemy.
B000PDZFCK|4.0|The idea of geometric probability distributions and their unpredictable effects on our lives is something which our linear intuition has problems grasping.  This book makes it very clear that the future cannot be expected to be like the past when we are dealing with phenomena (earthquakes, asteroid strikes, stock market crashes, etc.) which occur according to geometric probability distributions.  The author points out that we tend to assume incorrectly that all random phenomena are distributed according to the Normal (bell shaped curve) distribution.  The book is a bit thin in terms of what the implications for optimal human behavior are for all this, but it is an interesting, well-thought out and explained thesis.
B004HV54TU|5.0|I've had this mouse for about a year now and decided it was time I submitted a product review. After all, I've had a year to evaluate the product and determine if it really does what it claims. For this, let's look at the technical details and product description.<br /><br />I'll start off by saying why I purchased this mouse. I'm not knowledgeable about hand muscles, but my thumb muscle ached on my palm side. I couldn't think of any reason why it would hurt, except that I was ALWAYS on the computer...at work 40 hrs/wk, then I would come home and dork it out for hours on video games. Even when I stopped the video games and just would use a mouse 40 hours a week at work, it would make the same muscle hurt. Voicing my displeasure to my friends, I was first introduced to this mouse by a friend who uses the computer just as much as she is a graphics designer. With her recommendation and reading the reviews, it was a little easier for me to spend $90 on a mouse, in hopes that it would solve my issue. So, let's get to the good stuff! Did it work for me?<br /><br />Technical Details<br />The shape is thoughtfully sculpted for uncompromised comfort and easy-to-reach programmable buttons. No finger contortions are needed to operate the buttons<br />  This is very accurate. Nothing to expand on here.<br /><br />An extra wide lip along the bottom edge prevents the last finger from rubbing the desk.<br />  Yep, pinky does not stick out like I'm going to have a cup of tea to avoid rubbing the mouse pad.<br /><br />Pointer speed controls on the side allow convenient adjustment without even releasing your grip from the mouse. - Yep, but it does take a little getting used to.<br />  It's convenient once you know exactly where to put your fingers to change to pointer speed.<br /><br />Top mounted LEDs show through the chrome thumb rest to indicate selected pointer speed<br />  Oooh. Ahhh. Okay, well, it's not that impressive, but nice to have.<br /><br />The Evoluent VerticalMouse 4Small is for hands less than about 7 inches or 178 mm long from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist crease.<br />  Yes! Finally a mouse to fit my small hands. This mouse is perfect for me. I did measure my hand prior to  ordering this mouse to ensure I didn't need the standard one.<br /><br />Product Description:<br />Avoids forearm twisting for comfort and good health The patented shape supports your hand in an upright neutral posture that generally avoids forearm twisting. Many users, including medical doctors, ergonomists and physical therapists, said the Evoluent VerticalMouse provides superior comfort and even relieved their wrist pain.<br /><br />  So this is what it comes down to, right? While I did not have wrist pain, I did have palm pain. Did it work? YES!!!! YES!!!!! and if I could type in bigger caps, YYYYYEEEESSSS!. The pain in my palm disappeared in about a week after using this mouse. It's amazing what ergonomics can do for your body. I was able to convince my job to allow my to bring this to work (we never had a permanent desk). Although I did have to tote the mouse back and forth from home, it was worth it. The pain in my palm has not come back since using this mouse.  The mouse is still going strong and not having any issues. I did not have a learning curve when I began using this mouse, but I could see some people having to get used to the position of the buttons. You still swipe it side to side to move the mouse, like a regular mouse (I just thought I'd mention this because my coworkers would all ask me how do I move the mouse).  I hope this conveniences people who are on the fence about buying $90 mouse that it'll be worth it if it solves your arm, wrist, palm pains.  I will buy another one in the future if this one ever dies.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|I appreciate an artist that is trying to do something unique...or maybe a little different...but somethings should be left untouched.  I own a lot of James Bond soundtracks...and even though I've heard the theme a million times...I found myself missing it.  You just can't do a James Bond score without giving us that theme.  Play with the theme....add variations...experiment with it...don't tease an audience with it and never give it to them!  This score was like getting a piece of cake but forgetting the icing.  It's got action music...slow music...action music...noise music...and more action music.  Works for the film...just doesn't work for a James Bond soundtrack.
B00005U122|5.0|I first saw this concert during a PBS fundraising drive over 10 years ago, and have owned the CD's for years.  It was just recently that I bought the DVD of the concert and it is spectacular.  Over 2 hours of great footage that really elevates the songs to a new level.  Let it show you the sub titles with the lyrics the first couple times through if you're not 100% sure of them.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|John Williams has certainly given us a lot of tunes to hum during our lives.  He has scored some of the greatest movies ever...and his scores have no doubt contributed to their greatness.  I haven't heard anything from him lately and I really thought he retired...but this score really brings him back.  The music compliments the vision of this film and the iconic Lincoln so well.  John Williams has always been a master at creating memorable themes with his music and he succeeds so well with this creation.  If your a fan of his music...this will no doubt be pleasing to your ears.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|I subscribe to Sight&Sound magazine and have more Criterion films than I can count. I'm delighted to find a series bringing 15 hours of thinking outside of the E-Hollywood Story. All the names that should be there are present from Florence Lawrence to Lars Von Trier. Like the BBC series 'Wonders of the Universe', the presentation has a subtly experimental British edge putting Ken Burns and Oliver Stone's Secret History series in the dated category. I imagine many big name directors will have this in their personal collections.<br /><br />Other reviews are commenting on the narration, but this series does not court the TruTv documentary audience. His calm delivery is like an Irish Carl Sagan. I'm fine with it, as Mark Cousins allows the images to speak on their own terms.
B0002PZVHK|5.0|I discovered Brian Eno by accident a few months ago and I have to say that it is some pretty amazing.  I am a big soundtrack and classical music fan.  I also like New Age music from the Windham Hill days and I am always searching for something to relax to that isn't too distracting.  Brian Eno's &#34;Ambient&#34; sound is very cool.  It is music meant for daydreaming.  I highly recommend you give it a listen.  His other ambient work is all excellent as well.  I do not like his vocal or Roxy Music sounding stuff however...it seems that he has experimented with a lot of different sounds and music genres.

B0085YNML2|5.0|One of the slickest apps to hit the market since Angry Birds, and arguably more well made, aside actually having a very neat little physics system. This developer is definitely one to watch. Give it a shot!
030758836X|2.0|Divided into three parts, the first is enthralling. The second limped. The third fell. Midway through the second the unreliability of the narrator and characters was hard to ignore. There is absolutely no one to like in this novel. In this dysfunctional way, I made it into the third section, but I soon lost interest in it. My eyes crossed not in fatigue but in total disinterest. I read to finish.<br /><br />You will like the wildly complicated noose Amy strings for her Nick, the Nick who dreams of killing her, and later decides to stay for his unborn son. Doesn't he know how many pure happily married people resolve gaps in their marriage for the sake of the baby but cripple the kid and guarantee him years of analyses? Oh well, the sequel, I suppose.
B004KKXMSI|4.0|I am curious why Amazon has such a poor reviewer give the only editorial reviews for the Jurassic Park trilogy. You look at how poorly he feels about the first two movies, ok about the third and yet almost anyone ordering these movies would rank them among their favorites. Certainly your reviewer would be better placed giving input elsewhere.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie made another masterpiece.  The story is great. He brings back some old friends and you make some new ones.  If you are interested in some good fantasy I strongly recommend \\"Red Country\\".
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great for &#34;Alien&#34; lovers. Monry well spent. Almost more information than wanted. A thorough behind the scenes look at the series.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I still remember the first time I saw the movie ALIEN.  I thought it was one of the scariest movies around at the time.  Although that was over 30 years ago, I still feel the excitement and thrill of anticipating the creature's arrival.  My favorite movie from the anthology is without a doubt the second one.  This blu-ray anthology is a must for those who enjoy the sic-fi thrillers.  I would definitely recommend this as a present to get for Christmas or anytime.
0785163174|4.0|Reading through the main story in the hardcover for the first time, the story is pretty solid. The tale is told mainly through the Avengers side after the first couple of chapters, but its ambiguous enough to root for either side. Wish the binding was better and an additional gutter along the binding would have been nice, but the overall quality is good. Reviews left prior to release date should be taken with a grain of salt. Reading this over hyped epic through the single issues could have felt uneven, or a let down, but reading it this way for the first time is worth it. Especially at the Amazon price of around $45.
0877180121|3.0|This book is OK if you had not seen &#34;Teaching Little Fingers to Play&#34;. I would probably skip this one.
B0049VGSLG|5.0|This is by far one of the best CD's I have purchased in a long time.  I listened to it online after reading Rolling Stone review and they nailed it!  I couldn't wait to receive it, and have played it almost non-stop!
B000002AHM|4.0|Three of the best guitarists in the world team up to jam.  They show off their individual abilities, and seem to be in a contest to determine which one can produce the fastest runs.  I am floored by what each has trained himself to do on his instrument.  But I am less than floored by the music they chose to play.  Some of it sounds like it doesn't fit into what most people define as music.  But I'm a guitar lover, and these men play the instrument as though they had been born with a guitar in their arms.

B0085YNML2|5.0|Four star game. Adding extra star because the game plays with my tablet in landscape orientation.  I dislike games that require tablet to be held in portrait orientation. Just not comfortable for game play in my opinion.  Fun game, cute graphics. Unique idea to have to change character's colors.  If you enjoy this type of game well worth the download as the FAOTD.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|This warthog has none of the design flaws that were plaguing the original megabloks hogs'. The original ones fell apart easily and parts would just pop off for no reason, warped plastic pieces right out of the bag, I read all the horror stories. This hog is great, you wont need super glue to hold it together, the detail is fantastic and the new spartans (comes with two) look just right, one behind the wheel and one on the gun. I also really like the forerunner structure included in this set, the background pieces add a lot when you are trying to make a whole scene. Also comes with an Elite (against 2 spartans? better get some help my purple friend!)<br />BOTTOM LINE this is a great warthog kit, mine had absolutely no quality issues and I think megabloks has learned their lessons from the early halo kits, these new ones have been every bit as good as LEGO, but with better mini-figures. Clear, easy directions (you still have to pay attention, but it's a good lesson to learn), great design and pretty easy to build, 45 min. maybe? Very rewarding once it's finished.

B005HP2J66|5.0|\\"...It seems as though I am painting.  But I am not painting.  It is the spirit that is painting......\\"<br /><br />If I could give a documentary 10 stars, this is the one that would qualify. (at least to a lay person like myself) The subject is the Chauvet cave in France, a recent archaeological discovery (1994);  one of the most remarkable histories of Stone Age Man captured in his art that has remained unspoiled and unvandalized probably because of a rock slide that sealed the entrance.<br /><br />The documentary itself bespeaks of respect and reverence for such a site.  There is necessary narrative throughout, but enhancing this work beyond the pale of most documentaries, even the best of them, was the willingness of these scientists to just shut up, film the treasure site while allowing the dim light sources play over the breathtaking paleo artwork when it needed no other explanation.  There are long stretches during the end of the film where there is nothing audible;  only the visuals drifting by of the splendid, ethereal pictographs, letting the paintings softly speak for themselves.  And speak they do, silently, as though one is taken on a visit through the after life.  It was mentioned that there was an aura that everyone felt while in the cave, viewing and I felt it just seeing the film as it slid gracefully along the walls of the cave, dark fading out to light, the animals emerging as if from a dream - so \\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\" seems a fitting title; a hidden, lost world paying homage to a real one.<br /><br />Within the simple strokes of charcoal, which were not simple at all, these stone age artists captured the essence of animal spirit; not only the power and the beauty, but the expressions; the light in the eyes.  An elk so alert he seems ready to bound out of the wall, prides of lions, rhinoceros, buffalo of immense power and muscle, horses so beautiful and so featured it must be certain that the horse held a special place in the lives of these ancient peoples.  Using the smooth, but natural contours of the walls and concaves as frames for the work, some of it even seems to move over the uneven surfaces as the light falls upon it;  the \\"third\\" dimension from within the \\"fifth\\" dimension.  Only one human figure is given art space within the cave; and that is one that seems to be merging with a bison - the one object that suggests a continuity of life and spirit between human and animal. (at least to me)  On the floor of the tomb are remaining footprints of the ancients; people, wolves and cave bears - suspended in time.<br /><br />In one way, it is a shame that such amazing beauty from an age that won't come again cannot be shared with the world of people now, but in another, it was meant to be this way.  Even the collapsing of the cave entrance seems prophetic in the abstract sense.  The vandalism I personally have seen committed against some of our most accessible Indian rock paintings here in my own state makes me wonder what drives some people to the unreasoning things they do.  But unfortunately, that also seems to be \\"real\\" among us, so the need to restrict it must be fully appreciated.  Some things are not meant to be shared by too many.<br /><br />If you are interested in ancient cultures beyond the scope of history as we know it, this film is highly recommended.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Before purchasing these from Amazon I did a lot of looking around and I tested a lot of headsets (mainly because I've never owned a really nice headset before) from stores and read a lot of reviews. I ended up coming to the conclusion of buying these firstly because I have always been a huge fan of Logitech's work. I own a Logitech wireless surround sound, a G15 keyboard, a G-Series mouse, and various other Logitech products, and not once have they done me wrong.<br /><br />The comfort factor of these head phones amazed me, they are nice and snug and really soft, they adjust very easily and they are a lot lighter than I expected.<br /><br />The construction thus far seems to be very sturdy, I have yet to have any issues in that department.<br /><br />The 7.1 surround sound feature on this headset is so much better than I expected, I can actually hear more sounds and noises in games and movies than I ever could on my actual 5.1 surround sound, and after playing with the advanced equalizer for a while I now have it dialed in perfectly.<br /><br />I haven't changed the G-buttons much yet because I like to listen to music while I game ad have control over it easier, and since I have the G15 keyboard which has 18 macro buttons on it I really don't need to fiddle with them much. Never-the-less they work perfect so far. The volume control roller is perfect located for easy quick volume changes.<br /><br />Now onto my absolute favorite feature of this headset...the Microphone. This thing is 100% perfect for what I use this headset for, gaming at night with my wife asleep in the the same room as my computer. Now before the G930 I avoided Skype and teamspeak and vent at night because I always woke my wife up because I had to talk so loud for people to hear me. During the day I have the Mic gain turned down to about 40-50% for normal talking while gaming, at night I can turn this bad boy up to 100% and I can practically whisper and everyone hears me perfectly. I was absolutelyflabbergasted that I could talk so quiet and be heard without someone having to say &#34;Sorry what was that? I couldn't hear you.&#34; And this is with a group of 5-10 people on Skype so there is always more than 1 person talking at a time.<br /><br />One last note would be that I don't have to switch over to my speakers when I don't want to wear the headset, I can simply lay these down on the desk in front of me while charging and turn the volume up, they get ridiculously loud.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to any avid gamer.

0316228532|5.0|JK Rowling does a brilliant job of weaving together the complex stories of individuals in a small town. I couldn't put it down and finished it in 3 days. This book is most certainly for adults. If you're expecting a magical fairytale you will be sorely disappointed, which is why I found it quite refreshing to see this masterful story teller bring out the complex humanity in each of the characters who inhabit our every day lives. Someone wrote previously that we already know each of these characters. It's true, but Rowling peals away the facade of a small town to reveal what we all know to be true of ourselves. I can't wait for her next one!

I don't do any really advanced editing on my Kindle Fire, but the app handles all of the simpler editing functions that I need it to do.<br /><br />So far, I've been very happy with the app.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|I am a long time fan of the Bourne franchise, and I absolutely love the first three installments. However, this latest installment doesn't quite hit the mark. Jeremy Renner's performance as an actor was great, he was very believable, as was the rest of the cast. The story wasn't bad-although it came across as slow at times, and the action sequences were enjoyable too. The fact that Jason Bourne wasn't the main character wasn't the issue for me either. The issue for me was that the movie doesn't deliver that punch that the first three Bourne films delivered. You know that feeling that you experience after watching a really good movie, that overwhelming feeling of \\"WOW... what a great movie\\"! I'm speaking of the kind of Bourne film that you would watch a million times over. Unfortunately, this latest Bourne installment doesn't quite excite me. I'm not implying that Legacy isn't worth watching, just don't expect to be wooed by another great Bourne film, because this one leaves the die hard Bourne fans hanging. Merely entertaining is how I would sum The Bourne Legacy. Hopefully, Tony Gilroy will get it right with the fifth installment.

0316069434|3.0|It seems like I've been reading Harry Bosch novels forever.  In fact it has been twenty years since Michael Connelly wrote the first Bosch story.  Harry, like me, is 62 years old now.  A bit long in the tooth and somewhat of a plodder.  He still gets the goods but his original fresh approach has become a bit stale. The titles of his first two books, THE BLACK ECHO and THE BLACK ICE, were intriguing because they lent a mysterious connotation to the stories.  THE BLACK BOX as a title just seems flat and mundane.<br /><br />This was certainly not Michael Connelly's best effort.  But like any loyal reader, I will give him another chance before dropping him off my favorite's list. It has to be difficult for an author to keep his ideas original and fresh over a twenty year time period.  Too much of any one thing can get boring over time.  \\"If all I have is holiday and sport, then soon my holiday and sport become toil.\\" (Wm. Shakspeare)
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|Pretty funny movie...if you like Seth Mcfarlane's humor. At least he didn't try to get all political. Unlike most of these types of theme comedy, it didn't get old by the first half hour. And oh yeah- Mila Kunis is a Russian Goddess!!
B009AMANBA|4.0|The Thirteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for a crime.  Steven Spielberg's film, \\"Lincoln,\\" from a screenplay by Tony Kushner and based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, \\"Team of Rivals,\\" describes the horse trading and finagling that was necessary to pass the amendment in the House of Representatives.  Daniel Day Lewis is fine as the title character; Lewis's plain demeanor, humor, compassion, pragmatism, and eloquent speech do justice to the iconic individual he portrays.  Another standout is Tommy Lee Jones as Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania.  An ardent abolitionist, Stevens clashed violently with members of the pro-slavery faction during heated debates on the floor of the House.  The rest of the cast, including David Strathairn, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, acquit themselves well, although Sally Field's depiction of Mary Todd Lincoln could have been more subtle.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln,\\" as political pundit David Brooks wrote recently, reveals the dirty, nasty, and practical side of politics.  In a democracy, there is never a universal consensus regarding controversial issues.  So how do we avoid gridlock?  Savvy presidents try to curry favor among their opponents, twist arms, and make deals.  Goodwin praises Lincoln for reaching out to his rivals and doing what was necessary to bring warring factions together.  He refused to stand on ceremony, since the window of opportunity to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed was rapidly closing.<br /><br />Although \\"Lincoln\\" is an enlightening reenactment of a pivotal moment in American history, the film is long (two and a half hours) and talky.  There are brief scenes in which union and rebel soldiers fight to the death, Lincoln visits and consoles the wounded, and the President takes a somber tour of a bloody battlefield.  Aside from these interludes, most of \\"Lincoln\\" consists of men arguing about the pros and cons of slavery, the amendment's chances of passage, and how to extract votes from the holdouts.  This does not make for engrossing and fast-paced cinema.<br /><br />Janusz Kaminski's photography is effective, but Tony Kushner's script is sluggishly paced and John William's score is florid and intrusive.  \\"Lincoln\\" fails the \\"watch test.\\"  When I sit in a theater, if I glance at my watch more than three times, wondering how much longer the movie will run, that is not a good sign.  Nevertheless, seeing Daniel Day Lewis take command in such an inspiring role is worth the price of admission.  \\"Lincoln\\" provides a reality check for those who naively believe that running a national government, especially during wartime, is anything but messy and nerve-racking.  \\"Lincoln\\" earns three and a half stars, raised to four for Daniel Day Lewis's stunning performance.ns of slavery, the amendment's chances of passage, and how to extract votes from the holdouts.

After I ordered it however, I saw that it would not come before at the earliest 20th of December, and at the latest sometime in January. However, this seller was great. I received my package the ten days after I had purchased it, in the first week of December. I would highly recommend this seller.
0670026182|5.0|This is much more than a recipe book!  Katie's photographs, which she took herself, are works of still-life art in themselves.  Each recipe is accompanied by an entertaining background explanation about the dish and it makes each one very personal and special.  The recipes are delicious as well.  Altogether a first rate book of which I'm giving to several of my relatives for Christmas presents.  And I got one for myself!  You won't be disappointed

0440244412|5.0|I absolutely loved this series! Read it in order and be glad you don' have to wait between books. I purchased the first three and was so glad, that I was able to instantly download the final two on my kindle, or I would have gone insane waiting. Certainly leaves you with cliffhangers.<br />Luckily, this last book answers all your questions and leaves you with a satisfied feeling that you have read the whole series. What makes this series, possibly the best I've read is this: you have no idea just whom Mac should trust throughout the series. It's probably the most mind boggling set of mysteries that I've ever encountered. You find yourself thinking Mac has made a wrong choice here and there, but you don't actually know til this last book. Just who the good and bad guys are, becomes clear with this installment. It nicely wraps up all the loose ends, and leaves you with a cheer for Karen Marie Moning for having such a great talent.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have been playing Angry Birds for a while now and to be honest, they past he time but I wasn't a huge fan. Not until Space came along. I love this version of the game. I fin it more challenging and far more interesting. My son on the other hand finds it too difficult. My daughter loves all of them. For me, I deleted all but this and the new Star Wars edition. This is by far the best Angry Birds game.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|(written by a 13-year old)<br />  Well, Chris, are you happy? You managed to make hundreds of fans cry because you didn't stay faithful to the book. What surprises me about this is that so many people have given this a negative review because of its unfaithfulness. And, admittedly, I was very mad when I walked out of the theater. However, I managed to find some positive things in this movie:<br />  Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson: So many fangirls' hearts melted at the sight of this guy.Being another guy myself, my heart didn't. However, much like how Brandon Routh looked like Christopher Reeve as Superman, Logan Lerman looks remarkably like Percy(in my opinion). His only problem is that his eyes are blue while Percy is described as having green eyes. His personality? Ok. Percy is a very sarcastic character who actually takes it really well that Greek mythology is real. In the movie, Logan portrays him as being scared out of his mind, which could be argued as being realistic. But this is a book series with ghosts, hydras, and ancient gods. How realistic can you get?<br />  And that's all I can say about the characters that's positive. The acting is solid for the portrayal the actors were going for. Alexandria Daddario as Annabeth? Meh. Annabeth's spunky, intelligent, by the book personality that she has in the first book(it changes as the series goes on) is completely missing in Alex's portrayal. She instead acts like a flirty, typical teenager who happens to be good at sword fighting. Where's the intellectual prowess? The cunning portrayal? The battle strategies? The bickering between her and Percy? She just isn't there.<br />  All in all, a decent film, but a horrible book adaptation.
0517209764|5.0|I'll be honest, having his works in one books works for me. I don't like having more books than I need. This pulls them all into one, beautifully bound book. When my wife and I got together and she saw this she was instantly impressed and happy. It is also a great reference for school!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I highly recommend this app! its a lot of fun, and it gets harder and more difficult as the levels continue.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have used a few different eBook readers as I have owned an iPhone and I am now an Android user. I have this, the Nook app and the Google app loaded as some prices of books vary and I am a bargain shopper. I try to stick to purchasing for the Kindle app though. I also use it for my PDF books. Some sites also offer free eBooks so I will grab them in both PDF and mobi so I can use them on my PC and in the Kindle app. I find the interface very simple and the books more enjoyable through this app.
B0095T3H2U|5.0|Yes! And that's why this movie is so funny. The situational comedy is exaggerated for laughs, but the characters are real and believable. Not to mention, this movie really nailed what an academic's life is like.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|When I first saw he previews for this I just didn't get it. I couldn't see what all the hype was about. While I was deployed one of the guys had season one and two with him so I watched them. I was hooked. Drawn in by the excitement of the MC and the drama that come with Clay's bad decisions. This show is one hell of a ride!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love the game so my rating is clear. I knew the game from a friend and I had the PS3 version of it. I finally decided to buy it and I have already played a couple of times with friends and family. The game is very complete and I love it. Instructions can be complicated to follow for a quick start and for somebody with no previous contact with the game. I am checking already all the expansion options.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I enjoyed this game. I wasn't cut off after the first 2or 3 scenes or chapters. I got to finish it.

B0093URN4E|5.0|Converge just seem to be one of those bands that have the drive and fortitude to put out heavy album after heavy album,even after 20 years.<br />  If you are a fan of Converge I think it`s a safe bet that you will enjoy this album!
B00AMBH70S|1.0|slow pace with an unclear problem & too many assumed references. I did not realize that this was going to be a multi part series. their was not even a temporarily complete ending, the movie ended in the middle of a very slow, boring, & drawn out chase scene. this is the first time that I have been let down enough by a movie that I felt the need to rate it

0316223239|4.0|Room: A Novel, by Emma Donoghue is the story of a young boy Jack and<br />his Ma who live in \\"room,\\" a shack that has been Ma's prison and<br />Jack's home for years.  They are kept their by Old Nick, Jack's<br />biological father and Ma's captor.  The whole story is told from the<br />perspective of five year old Jack who has spent his whole life in room<br />and sees it as home more than a prison.  As you can imagine, his Ma's<br />only goal is to keep him alive and get both of them out safe, but,<br />sometimes being out of your prison can be just as devastating as<br />staying in it.<br /><br />I won't give away any more of the plot as it does make for a wonderful<br />and intriguing journey. There are a lot of things Donoghue does well<br />in this novel.  Talking about Jack's love of room without sounding<br />fake of overdoing it while still capturing his mother's desperation to<br />make it out.  She gets into the mind of someone in the situation and<br />runs with it, coming up with a portrait of two characters that, even<br />though their situation is beyond belief, come across as tangible and<br />believable.  Now, as much a I liked the book with its hard to handle<br />beginning and heartbreaking second half along with a somewhat<br />uplifting ending, the entire novel is narrated through the voice of a<br />five year old.  While this is novel at first, by the end of the book I<br />was struggling to finish.  Jack is an amazing character and gives a<br />unique perspective that makes this difficult subject matter easier to<br />handle, but it's hard to handle.  I would have liked some chapters<br />narrated by \\"Ma\\" or just another narrator to break things up a little<br />and let me read some adult thoughts for a change.  This is no reason<br />not to pick up this book by any means, but it does take some mental<br />preparation before you dive in.<br /><br />This novel is the furthest thing from a holiday fluff novel as you can<br />get and if you're thinking of picking it up I'd save it for the new<br />year, but if you need something to inspire you into feeling grateful<br />for what you have this is the book for you.  Donoghue's novel takes<br />you deep into a dark, unimaginable crime and leaves you with a broken<br />heart and hope.nking of picking it up I'd save it for the new<br />year, but if you need something to inspire you into feeling grateful<br />for what you have this is the book for you.

0439813786|5.0|This book is a great for kids and adults. My eight year old son and I have read it together several times. It's very engaging.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is what others hope for a true gem in the genre you can't ask for more at this price for a whole season every episode is thrilling piece of drama with a great cast.even a non horror fan can enjoy this series,but I don't approve of allowing young viewers watch it is a little strong at times.were all responsible viewers right?
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is more emotional than season one way more mature content ,feeling out the viewership.More sexual and some personal objecture on my part but alot of good viewing for price lots of extras.
1442359315|4.0|Excellent read especially for me as I had a near dearth  expierence myself but did not go as far as Dr. Alexander did. It reassures my faith in God and in heaven an what we have in store for those who have faith.

B0099G4Y26|5.0|I don't think I've ever disliked a Pink CD so maybe I'm biased, but this cd was so great!  I think I listened to it 5 times back to back the 1st day.  I still can't get through Beam Me Up without crying.

0743581490|5.0|UNabridged, if you can find one.  There was never a finer use of audio to enhance the experience of a book.  The book itself is indisputably a masterwork; enough has been written about that.  I just want to emphasize that for this book in particular -- an epic autobiography told almost entirely in the first person present-tense -- Frank McCourt's own voice is indispensable.  Reading the words on the page cannot convey the difference between the southern and northern Ireland accents that he renders intuitively, adding a deep layer of characterization and color.  His rendition of other people's voices -- neighbors, teachers, relatives, classmates -- enhances our understanding of those relationships.  And most importantly, his *inflection* of each line of his own thoughts and dialogue conveys his actual experience of a situation in a way the written words could not: resignation where a reader might mistakenly infer desperation, the true intensity of the shame and guilt that pervaded so much of his childhood -- and yes, occasional wonderment, pride, even joy.<br /><br />Angela's Ashes is my single favorite book, which I own on CD and listen to every year (when it starts to rain in northern California -- fans will know why).  For anyone who wants one unforgettable experience: LISTEN.
B007HJ91HU|1.0|I suppose the fact that I was a teenager when the original came out ruined any chance for this one to be considered good.  The music was painful to ones ears which is a shame since there were some pretty decent artists involved. What has happened to acting? This was abysmal. Ariel was not believable in the least bit as the slutty preachers kid.  Ren was inept at dancing, acting, emotion etc. His less than emotion filled speech to the city council was pathetic to say the least. Dennis Quaid failed miserably as Shaw.  John Lithgow was an imposing man as Shaw while being soft spoken. I won't even start in on Rusty and Willard. Changing the story line in some places to update it only served to further ruin the film. School bus races? Really? Why change it from playing chicken with tractors? That scene was so pathetically boring I was forced to fast forward through for any hope of finishing this film.  Truncating multiple scenes into one to well I suppose shorten the time frame leaves the viewer wondering what the hell the director was thinking.  Having Ariel confess her sins in church in front of Shaw should have been full of fire not \\"oh by the way i'm not even a virgin\\".  I fast forwarded through several parts of the movie just to get past the horrific acting and suddenly feel the need to watch the original to try and erase this one from my mind. Hollywood needs to stop remaking films and come up with some decent new ideas.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This was a gift to my best friend for the holidays. I don't watch this shoe but she is a huge fan of the show and I knew she did not have this season yet. She liked it so much that she watched in all in just two equal sittings.
1449410243|5.0|I trust the Oatmeal to produce quality things and this book is not a let down. It was funny and quirky while not trying to dumb things down for all the little people out there. I love this.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I love this movie.  Steve Martin is outstandingly funny as always.  This is a classic which I've watched in many times.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|So dissapointing...like others state only can view about ten feeds, the like does not work, nor can you share anothers post...please Amazon fix this mess of an app
B009IHED0E|5.0|I'm a hundred percent with the previous review. I'm a 60 years old fan of progressive rock in all its forms and I can say this is really one of the very few records that I can play from start to finish - not a single skip - . I've just finished to hear it for the sixth time and was urged to get into my computer and write this review. This is really a masterpiece. All the elements of a great record are present: Beautiful melodies, great melodic guitar playing - not strident -, a beautiful chorus on the right spots; same for the use of two opera singers (one female, one male), just in the right moments. The drumming by Gavin Harrison, fantastic. The only intervention of Steve Hackett, sublime. The singer, a spectacular voice with real feeling. The Celtic ambiance on some of the songs are just right. Every song with strong melodies, with very interesting variations and delicate and surprising touches on each of them. My opinion is that this record should please almost every follower of Progressive Melodic-Symphonic Rock as well as many other people who isn't. The disc with the other formats, specially the DTS option, is very well recorded. Do yourself a favor and buy this record no matter the cost. You won't regret it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game rocks but the sad thing is that you cant do everything that you can do in plain minecraft. For one thing you cant spawn villagers. You also cant fight the other monsters, create some things, or have things like signs or lava orthrow fire. I give it four stars.

B000SEGUDE|1.0|What a piece of crap.  I read relentlessly and this is the most unreadable piece of drivel I have run across in a long while.  It makes \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" seem like \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\".  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game...so scary...so creepy...so Awesome!!!<br />Just like Pc...And if you watch WWE WRESTLING you will know that this game is AWWWWWWWESOME!!!

0307592731|2.0|I hate to give a negative review to a autobiography - after all, this is a book about the author's life - however, I could only make it half way through this book. Perhaps Ms. Strayed had some amazing and life-changing experiences in the second half that would have made reading it worthwhile. The part I read, though, was the tale of a woman who had a good life and train wrecked it on purpose because her mother died - young and fast. While the death of a loved parent could send anyone off course, most people don't deal with their grief by becoming promiscuous adulterers and heroine users.<br /><br />To try to find herself and get back on course, Ms. Strayed takes off on a multi-state hike ridiculously unprepared, and her hiking trip is a lot like her life - veering around, often off course, relying on the kindness of strangers for all matter of help, and wishing for more sex.<br /><br />Like I said, maybe there's redemption in the second half of the book, but what I read was proof of the adage \\"Wherever you go, there you are.\\"
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Just buy the DVD and watch it! The only problem with watching Breaking Bad on DVD is that it is tough not to watch the entire season the day you get it!
