B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was filed with plot twists and turns so it was a quick read. It made you think about the moral dilemmas involved with family or friends. I don't want to give anything away, so all I can say is it was a well written book that I really enjoyed.
B00CKKDZ2S|2.0|Not very interesting. Tried it a few times and wondred why I bothered. I wouldn't<br />Recommend this.  Don't bother. A waste of time
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've successfully transformed 2 of my devices into kindle readers.  I have loaded this app onto my smartphone and also my tablet.  I can access the books that I've loaded on either device, and it remembers where I left off regardless of which device I started on.  I wasn't sure how that would work.  So, I did some reading on my tablet, then continued later on my smartphone.  Kindle asked me if I wanted to pick up where I left of on the other device.  Fabulous.  The interface is user-friendly, and functional.  I have no complaints to report.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very fun game to play well worth the download will recommand to anyone to play it an download it an see
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is straight up bomb-tastic. I've been addicted since the first time I played. Connecting it to Facebook adds to the competitiveness and I love it. I would recommend that you get it. And I have a great opinion on everything so you can trust me.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|dunno y u gotta put a rating on this but good mp3 download will recommand to anyone that likes this music
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is one of the few books I simply could not finish reading.  The whole setup was too full of disfunctional characters, with some of the main ones being the worst.  It felt like it was set up to pivot around the oped that was sent in by one of the town counsellors just before he died.  He sets up a young (and visibly wayward) girl as a star, and she is set up as a disaster.  Unfortunately, that setup disappears.<br /><br />I would not recommend it.  It just seemed to me to be uniformly depressing.
B00APD7CKS|5.0|Even if you don't really like movies about dancing, this movie makes the best use of 3D and great dance choreography, to create an eye-popping visual experience.<br /><br />The picture quality is incredibly crisp, and the 3D effect remains sharp, especially during the high-energy dance routines.<br /><br />\\"Step up: Revolution\\", and Avatar, are the two movies I use to show off my 3d TV.
B001K3KK0Q|2.0|The Redford version is more true to the book. But the book is the book. The Redford version is a boring 2-1/2 hour movie. The DeCaprio version better captures the mood of the times in film in a way that a true-to-the-story film Didn't. While I read the book in a few sittings, the Redford version required several sittings for me to complete.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app. This app made my Kindle work so much better I still don't believe  it.  I should have downloaded this app sooner, I wish I would have found it sooner. This should come standard on all kindled.
B00EO2I6XS|4.0|Early while watching this film, a scene came to mind from the novel \\"The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.\\" by George Steiner. An aged German judge, in the S.S. during his youth, listens to his daughter and her friends, in the next room, playing the piano. Their playing is technically accomplished but too safe; they're afraid, in music as elsewhere, to cross boundaries of convention, to dare the unexpected, the rash, the exceptional. Therefore their music is mediocre. He doesn't blame them. After all, his generation had dared, made a fetish of, stepping over boundaries, crossing lines, boldly going into the unprecedented. No. Better play safe. Be nice, good, unassuming Germans.<br /><br />For a German director, presumably non-Jewish, and her friends to make a film about Hannah Arendt, Adolf Eichmann and his trial in Israel, questions about the Holocaust and evil, and the reactions of New York intellectuals, mostly Jewish, was an audacious start. But everything after that seems to have been very concerned with playing it safe, polite, to avoid any potential for serious offense from the likely audience, to please the people one would afterward meet at dinners, parties.<br /><br />What would make for a more daring film? Into mind drifted a near-riot I witnessed years ago over the Italian film \\"Immacolata and Concetta\\". Some of those storming out, very very upset, threatened to tear down the theater. Some had pieces of the theater in their hands. What bothered them so? Most said they had a expected a pleasant soft-core lesbian romance -- but instead felt subjected to abuse, torture. It was torture of sorts. That film adeptly used conventions of cinema realism, psychological manipulation, to lure us, the audience, into that relaxed state of pleasant surrender we usually want, over and over and again. But just when it had us there, so soft and pliant, that film, again and again, abruptly, by visual and auditory means, applied shock, psychological cruelty, to viscerally alienate us, as audience, out of passive compliance, and attempting, in a manner likely inspired by Artaud and Brecht, to move us away from that warm oceanic passivity toward sharp thought especially about our own psychological habits, our routine patterns of response, of seeking escape from the world of harsh power-relations into private utopias. To instead no longer at ease confront, examine delusions and truths.<br /><br />But this film, this \\"Hannah Arendt\\", doesn't dare. Staying safely within banal conventions of cinematic documentary realism, it doesn't try much to make visible the invisible surreal irreal life of the mind, as more daring directors have. But this avoidance is fascinating. Interest in, movement toward the proclaimed overt issues, themes, seems only simulated, a head fake. Instead there's much more attention, care for female faces and bodies, clothed and elegant, not lascivious, but as if searching there for something else entirely, somewhere between physical desire and abstraction on the way up Diotima's ladder toward the opposite of evil and banality. But this remains too much an undercurrent hidden under a too-circumspect, too polite, too determined to be conventional, surface. Sticks and stones and Nazi thugs may hurt our bones. But words and mere shadows on a screen? There, we can and should dare.enate us, as audience, out of passive compliance, and attempting, in a manner likely inspired by Artaud and Brecht, to move us away from that warm oceanic passivity toward sharp thought especially about our own psychological habits, our routine patterns of response, of seeking escape from the world of harsh power-relations into private utopias.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|Can there be a 1 star Jack Reacher story?  No, don't think so.<br />I keep coming back for more and am nearly finished with all these books.<br />Lee Child has a truly unique manner of story telling....not too much info,,,<br />not too little....just right to keep you hooked till the end.<br />I love knowing all the quirks of Reachers....his likes, dislikes, attitudes, insights,<br />everything about him is interesting & unique.<br />I am a huge fan.
B003EXY1WS|5.0|Honestly didnt even know about this album when I first came across it, but it is a definite buy. Contains a great balance of songs and the covers are nice as well. The concert video is sweet, really a great performance that shows just how great the guys are live.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An amazing show. I can't say I was prepared for the season finale, but it should be interesting to see where Downton goes after what happened.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|We bought the movie for a recent car trip and the kids loved it and watched it over and over!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Again, we didn't want to wait for this to get uploaded to Netflix so we purchased it. It was well worth it - although now we have to wait until the next season airs!
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this because our 28-months old grandson who LOVES cars of all kinds was coming to visit. He'd never seen the movie but knew who Mater and McQueen were, probably from friends. Our son didn't think he'd sit and watch a 2-hour film but thought maybe a 15-20 minute stretch would be enough. Hmm....two hours later, he was still watching. The only &#34;scary' part was when Harvester came out to run off Mater & McQueen after they took to some 'tractor tipping'. Otherwise, this little boy who loves cars, big rigs, farm and construction equipment of all shapes and sizes and knows their names and what they do, was totally enthralled with the characters and action. It was just as much fun for his grandparents who had never seen the movie either! We sent the movie home with them!
0385302320|5.0|This is #3 of a 7 book series.  I am totally caught up with this series.  A story of Scotland's history in 1745, of time travel through &#34;The Stone&#34;, and so many adventures and romance.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show. It's funny and interesting and not boring. It's different than any other show out there. I would recommend this show.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|This is a great romantic old fashioned movie.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who is a romantic at heart.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I really like this game I like how you can we visuals of actual cars great graphics and robots in Tokyo? I didn't see that coming there's a wide variety of cars and courses with multiplayer online mode but 1 bad thing takes up a lot of space 800 mb to run but it's worth it and why free?? Some other asphalt games are like $2.00 get this game it's awesome
B000OIZSVY|5.0|Just read it and enjoy it. If, along the way, you learn something about grammar that you never knew before, consider it a plus.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best TV Series ever.  I don't know how I missed it when it first ran on the network.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Ms Moriarty's book had me up most of the night. I simply HAD to find out what his secret was.  I did, and then had to keep reading to find out how it affected all the characters in  the story. Well done!
B005JABU82|4.0|The best version of the Freedom yet. Just so many small parts. A good build for anyone who wants to better there skills.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|A welcome change in subject matter from cops/robbers/sify/mobsters/detectives and dysfunctional families....I'm still singing the great songs in my head and found the performances of McPhee and Hilty really outstanding.  Connected with other cast too and just found the whole subject and delivery delightful.

B00F35BV64|5.0|Awesome movie from beginning and end. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Chris Pine as Kirk is spectacularly portrayed.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|Even a passing semblance to the book other than the title would have been nice. Wooden acting, 4 engine prop planes flying around the world w/out refueling; UN saves the day feel good cr@p. What a waste of 15$ and 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|...it's hard to shake the feeling that even in all his years of research and even with all his knowledge, he seems to be trying to convince himself that Jesus is not divine.<br /><br />The book's tone feels very contradictory, and by the end it comes across like a man who went from Muslim to atheist to finding Christ to trying to convince himself (and all of us) that Christ is nor was he ever divine.<br /><br />And, of course this book would be published by the big publication houses, the anti-Christian idiots on both coasts, who delight in any academic argument that would &#34;prove&#34; that Christians don't have a theological leg to stand on.<br /><br />Hilarious.  It's still about faith.  But it's funny.  Even if Jesus were a zealot, even if he didn't mind helping to rid the Romans from the Holy City, none of his vast knowledge and research disproves the central question of whether Jesus was a spiritual Messiah.  Anyone can look at the Bible and interpret it any number of ways.  This is the reason there are so many religions.  And the same could be said with the way Mr. Aslan writes his book.  Much of this is very compelling, but Aslan's obvious ego regarding Academia in general and his disdain for &#34;the unscholarly&#34; doesn't help him in writing this book.  He all but calls Stephen---the first Christian martyr an &#34;idiot&#34; who easily bought the entire Jesus-is-God story because, like him, Jesus' apostles were also unlearned morons who got this notion in their head.  But there are three types of academia: that of the head, the heart and the spirit.  Mr. Aslan makes a good case for the first two, but never once does he (nor could he) explain the reason why so many hundreds of millions of people have had their spirits guided to Christ and his Divine purpose.  That He lives.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Excellent and exciting all the way through!  The portrayal of the bullies and the one being bullied made you really feel their internal pain,
B003UESJH4|1.0|Excellent inside story of King George and the man who became his friend and confidant.<br />A must see. A great piece of British history.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I have waited for this to be released on dvd/instant streaming and was SUPER excited to get it in HD. We will be watching this often!!
B00E7SID9G|5.0|I gave this book five stars because reading it helped me to clarify my own doubts and misgivings about the Christianity I was raised with and still practice from time to time. Mr. Aslan, in all likelihood has enraged the bulk of the christian community with this carefully researched and well written book. It is a history lesson that almost reads like a novel so it is clear that he spent a lot of time sifting through ideas on how to simplify some extremely weighty issues. In my opinion he did a great job of it. Since he is a relatively young man I can't wait to see what next history novel will be.<br /><br />Reading this book did not make me less of a believer but it helped me to understand that the Christ that was forced down my throat by the good Nuns and Priests and my elementary school has never existed. Nevertheless, the Christ/God that results from Mr. Aslan's book comes out as a much more believable historical figure and the source of my doubts about about the divinity of Christ, in my mind, has been laid to rest.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Aslan for helping me see through two thousand years of fog.
B009EEG8J0|5.0|We decided to purchase this movie on Instant because it is e are able to play HD on many of our devices, anywhere we are, and at any time. We have watched it at least 50 times since purchasing it because it is such a great movie with funny addlibs. Would recommend it!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I don't mind admitting it:  I bought this movie because it was not going to be available on On Demand any more (at least for a while), and my husband and I love it so much we wanted to be able to watch it whenever the mood strikes. It's fun to watch, great casting, unbelievably wonderful music and choreography -- starts off by grabbing your attention and doesn't let go until the final notes have faded.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Saw this movie in theaters awhile back. It was a very bland movie honestly. Not what I expected at all. That's coming from someone who's a huge fan of the Marvel Universe. I really don't like at all how the villain in this movie, or at least who everyone thought was the villain, was a bumbling idiot. I feel it would have been a much better movie if they had kept him as the actual villain. Not only that, I'm pretty sure there is an actual Marvel comics villain named the Mandarin, who was either Chinese, Middle-eastern or something like that. So that was curve ball that I didn't particularly like.<br /><br />The recent trend in superhero films starting to prove that movies are getting more bland, this one proving that. Man of Steel I believe was the same kind of deal, although I'll admit I enjoyed that movie more.<br /><br />I highly enjoyed almost all the other movies in the Marvel Universe. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America, Incredible Hulk, the Avengers, not including Thor. Even the other ones outside Marvel; X-men, fantastic 4, blade, etc. But this film, just isn't that great at all. Stay away from it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. While it was a bit depressing sunject matter, I felt it was funny and heartwarming at the same time. A great love story!
B008220C38|5.0|Fast and on time delivery, excellent condition, new, well packaged.  The film is worth watching, and deserves all the prizes it has and will receive.  Tom Stoppard is a genius.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|An enjoyable dramity, with great singing and witty characters. Definitely worth chilling on the couch and laughing with some friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is fun for all my kids.  It appears to be leveled for the age of the individual player.

B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I have a FitBit and we thought we would try the Withings for my husband.  I was already familiar with the FitBit app and got lost loading the Withings app and once it was loaded, the &#34;dashboard&#34; wasn't much of a dashboard.  The cool thing was the pulse reader but not worth the other negative items.  Needless to say, we returned this item and ordered my husband the FitBit.  He is much happier.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Love this game.  The sound effects and graphics are  adorable  and will keep you entertained for hours.Highly recommend getting the game.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read. The seals are a great arm this country has at its disposal, and marcus shows they will take it all the way. I have a lot of respect for the men on that ridge. I felt as if I watched it all unfold through a window. Now on to his next book. God speed!
034580404X|4.0|This boxed set was considerably cheaper than buying the books individually at the store. As for literary quality, you might want to stick to the Classics. But for something fun, it was a page turner.
B003R4ZMJU|3.0|Coffee!! The characters are either making coffee or drinking coffee...all of the time. If there is such a thing as a Columbian Coffee Bean Grower's Association? I am sure they are behind it. :)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|My husband read this whole series This must have been really good, because he had his iPad on every waking moment reading the complete series.  He was looking for more but the Authur has not written past book five.

B00AZL3PBK|1.0|This game wouldn't let me even play  the third level and up. It just stopped at level 2. Consider another game because this one isn't the best. It was fun for awhile.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is pure awesomeness it's a great game to pass the time and with a the upgrades and costumes too!
B002PEP4U0|2.0|Didn't finish it - which is something I rarely do with a book. Offers windows into the culture of Malawi but that wasn't enough for me
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Can Walter be anymore evil?  Jesse emerges as the only character on this show with any compassion.  Feel so bad for him and his addiction!
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Such a long way FOR THIS? Her Management should be ashamed to have done such piss-ass job of a beautiful experience. Over-edited, saturated, grainy and mishmash of HD and SD footage. And her hair in the beginning is a mess. You'd think someone would have paid more attention to quality control before locking picture. And the constant crowd noise is so unrealistic. Sad!<br /><br />This is not even worth a star.
B008602KQI|4.0|I read the series and thought this was a fair representation of the book.  It would be hard to show the bloodiness that was in the book but I didn't mind the movie leaving a lot of that to my imagination and not &#34;hitting me in the face&#34; with it.  Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress and she nailed the Catniss character!
B0053F042G|3.0|Good premise but the leap of faith was too great. Either you should make the fantasy science ambiguous or the explanation should seem plausible
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Oh help!  It is interesting to see who, of anyone, that Walter will not kill. The development of the characters on this series keeps me interested.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a very helpful application! I love being able to see what the weather is for the day and week.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found the game to be challenging yet not so much that it could not be figured out.  Great graphics, pictures and concepts.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|It seemed everyone was enjoying this but my wife and me. No more. Bought the series, and we're never without something great to watch. It's a reminder to me as a novelist to cut to the chase, reach for the heart, stick with the characters, and never bore. We can't get enough.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was suspense full and i thought it was always going to end but it just kept going you need to read this book

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Easy to follow information the writer did a rwally good job putting information into a little book, easy to enjoy.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|The Mist is a great Sci-fi thriller! Its story and the composition of collections of horror from the creepy critters and giant creatures leaves you wanting more thrills despite your fear. The devastation of what the lead actor goes through is the greatest horror of it all!! Very unforgettable.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|It is entertaining & can be addictive. I like that some puzzles are simple & then there is a tricky one.
0380018179|5.0|It arrived super fast - new and no problems.  I read this years ago and wanted a copy to send to my 18 year old daughter to read while she's at college.  I remember it as a great love story.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Bradley Cooper in a trash bag is the perfect pick for a mixed up, emotionally challenged hero for the equally damaged heroine in the movie. The attic scene made me laugh out loud while feeling empathy for the character.  The mother is superb as well as the other actors.  Five stars!
B0053O89JM|4.0|Enjoying it so far, but you can see why this is the final season. Missing Cuddy, and so many storylines have already been done. I do like Chase's increased depth in this season, the highlight for me so far.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great Fun searching for clues and hidden objects.  Game has good hints and comments giving the player help all g the way.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was dissappointed. I wish there was more of an original story line. I felt like the author rushed writing this book. There is a lot of repetition through out the novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy searching for hidden objects and solving the puzzles.  Not very difficult but does provide some challenges.  GREAT FUN.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Lots of spy action, quirky characters, great one liners, and there's romance too.  Its the kind of movie we watch over and over again.  We especially love the quirky but lovable characters (Mary Louise Parker,  John Malkovich, Helen Mirren).

B00DHHWXYY|5.0|It is so refreshing when a film lives up to your expectations. I have been a fan of Fitzgerald's masterpiece for many, many years. Happily, I was very impressed with this version. I don't think it could have been better filmed or casted. The soundtrack -- a bit controversial to some who don't understand the director's artistry -- was perfect in expressing the spirit of each given scene.  (People forget that jazz was the hip-hip/rap of its day. The older generations in the 20's denounced it as \\"Devil's music.\\" Also, this movie speaks to the younger audiences today. The contemporary soundtrack is successful at making viewers long to be a part of the lavish, wild parties thrown by Gatsby, and greatly add to his allure.) People who take this story only at face value are missing the larger picture. This book/film is a (rather cynical) commentary on the elusiveness of the American Dream -- something that countless Jay Gatsbys have striven for, only to become faceless victims of its sharp (but hidden) teeth.<br /><br />The spirit of this story is perfectly understood by its actors (or so it appears.) DiCaprio, because he is so attractive physically, is often underrated as an actor. He nailed Jay Gatsby. As far as I was concerned, he WAS Jay Gatsby. He managed to convey the perfect balance of Gatsby's grand mystique and devastating vulnerability.<br /><br />This is a film I feel I must own. Rarely do I come to that conclusion about any new film.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|This is a very  fun album.  Most of the songs are upbeat.  Highlights are- hurricane,  top of the world,  5:15.

1483934772|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall (Dwellers of Ahwahnee) by Author Sheryl Seal<br /><br />First of all I would like to say how much I have always enjoyed Native American stories and legends. Therefore, right from the onset of this fictional novel, I was hooked by the storyline. It is interesting, well-written and very easy to read.  Oria, the protagonist is soon to be eighteen but she will not be celebrating her birthday with her friends in quite the manner she anticipated or would have preferred. Her Grandmother has been her caregiver ever since she can remember. Her parents died in a house fire when she was a very young child and she has no memory of them.  Oria loves and respects her Grandmother and she appreciates her heritage...as a member of the Ahwahnee Tribe. Every summer they drive up to Yosemite Park to meet up with their clan and this summer is no exception. However, there does appear to be a sense of urgency on Grandmother's part as she shares with Oria that her circumstances will be changing on this, her eighteenth birthday. Oria has no idea what to expect but she goes along with her Grandmother and decides to make the best of it.<br /><br />After a night by the campfire and the sharing of many stories, Oria makes her way to bed. In the morning she wakes and sees that she is alone. She then decides to make her way to the water for a morning swim when she feels a gentle pull taking her deeper into the water. When Oria is finally released and pokes her head out of the water, nothing looks familiar to her. Suddenly a young handsome man with the same skin color as her own appears when she calls out for help in order to retrieve her clothes. In his arms is a beautiful set of clothing made especially for her. He introduces himself as Grey Wolf. He also manages to lead her to his village despite her trepidation. She feels very odd and thinks she is dreaming as her Grandmother is nowhere to be found and all the villagers are strangers to her. After a much needed rest, when she awakens, she finds a very old man seated before her by the name of Elsu who asks her to call him Grandfather. He then explains why she is there and what her role in life will be. Grandfather explains that she is a \\"shape shifter\\" and she is \\"Beyond Bridalveil Falls\\" to learn how to best use her gifts which is to help save the world from evil. Oria has much information to absorb and digest. As her Grandmother so richly stated, \\"knowledge is power\\".  The goal of the elders is to teach the \\"shape shifters\\" in the proper way to utilize their gifts according to their customs and ancestry. Oria is about to gain much knowledge so that she is fully prepared to use her power.<br /><br />Oria soon learns from Grandfather that she is even more gifted than the other residents of this quaint village. He calls her the Golden Queen Fairy and stresses the importance of her role in the plans of the Great Spirit who is the driving force behind all the good in the world.  It doesn't take long for Oria to fully realize the extent of her very unique powers as she discovers she can read minds and communicate with Grandfather without the use of speech. She also discovers an unfamiliar emotion in the presence of Grey Wolf which is very foreign to her. They have a mysterious connection which neither fully comprehends but has every desire to investigate. However, there is more important matters to be addressed. Evil has breached the boundaries of the secret village and there is a traitor or possibly more than one amongst them.  It is imperative for Oria to hone her skill as quickly as possible because it seems that she is destined for greatness. With the disappearance of Grey Wolf and the combined efforts of her friends Aponi, Red Thunder, White Bear and the other Dwellers of the village, she rises to the daunting challenge set before her...<br /><br />Talented Author Sheryl Seal takes her reading audience on an incredible journey in \\"Beyond Bridalveil Falls\\". Along with Oria, they enter into a magical word of dreams, power, and all kinds of incredible choices and possibilities. There is much wisdom shared in this fictional novel by the use of many well-known adages such as...\\"enlightenment, joy and peace can never be given to you by another; the well is inside of you\\".

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|All of a sudden my Kindle HD would not play or find my videos. MoboPlayer was suggested and I tried it.<br />MoboPlayer is the movie video player that should have been included in the stock Kindle because it works.<br />Thank you MoboPlayer, you saved the day.
B003DT19F0|5.0|If you love Tinker Bell and the new stories about fairies, you and your child will love this movie! It is fantastic!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Really great. Can't believe I had never seen it. So fun to see so many Sopranos characters. Absolutely a classic and need to watch it again to catch all the great nuances of characters and plot dynamics.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I bought a book for my daughter from a second hand store. She loved the book, then on a favorite child's video, I discovered there was a video made with the most beautiful music that the book had been made from! Love Love Love the music!
B003VDY7XE|4.0|Just the kind of show my girlfriend and I find interesting. Supernatural but not to serious just the right amount of comedy mixed in
B001T6PXFG|5.0|This is a true story about raw courage that actually has a happy ending, to WWII.  I was a child back then, and carry that fearful dred it will happen again, if we allow it.  This is about the Vatican priest who protected and moved out of harm's way refugees from Hitler's grasp.  I am a huge fan of Christopher Plummer, who plays the relentless villain, until he becomes the hunted.  There are seens inside the Vatican of interest to me, and John Geigud was well cast as the Pope.  The acting was wonderfully pitted between the principles. I would see this again, as one of very few that I'd choose to do so.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play, enjoyable and mobile on my Kindle allowin g me to take with me.. Comparable to playing solitaire on my computer.
1401937268|5.0|angel tarot cards are easy and great to use,better understanding to do the tarot cards, gave me my answers and easy to use
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This is a serious film with very good performances by all involved. The title &#34;Mud&#34; could have been improved upon. It happens to be the name of the protagonist played by McConaughey.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Was very interesting and well written<br />It made me want to read the White Queen<br />It was equally as good.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|This is a very entertaining movie. Just don't try to take it seriously. It' s not going to make a lot  of sense and it's difficult to suspend disbelief far enough to encompass this film. Sit back and accept it for what it is; the equivalent of sleight of hand in a movie.
0545305497|3.0|I bought this as a gift and the person I gave it to seems to enjoy it.  They have been read and thoroughly enjoyed.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not enough streaming options. I understand that will develop as time progresses with the addition of more and more apps. IMO it will never have as many content options as a Roku due to the Google factor.
B0028KF4M4|3.0|I bought this as a gift and the person I gave it to seems to enjoy it.  It has been watched and thoroughly enjoyed.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I wish he had been able to save the girl, it would have made him a hero. Then he would have had another girlfriend In his past.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Though we have not yet watched the episodes, I LOVE this series. We dont have HBO so being able to see the series at my own leisure is exciting.
B002RI98BA|5.0|Well written overview of Lincoln and his peers.  This book brought the personalities and events to life in ways far better than conventional Lincoln biographies.  Both the big events and the small details of conversations, parties and so on mixed in this teling to give a rounded view of all the major players.  The writing is consistently good and the detail derived from numerous sources is amazing.  Recommended.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I really like this series and since I don't have HBO it is great to have the DVDs with so many episodes.
030758836X|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! I think it will translate well into a movie and can't wait to see it! Highly recommend.
B001XVKKDM|1.0|Does not look HD to me, I own the DVD but wanted to watch a HD version..... Disappointed not 16x9
0307341577|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - kept me engaged and interested and thinking about the characters long after I put the book down. I liked that I read this book first in the series - this way I didn't have my expectations too high for Gone Girl (which I completely loved). Good solid book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The Downtown Abbey story is fabulous with great writing.  The actors are so well cast in their parts, and they come across as real people.  The conflicts throughout the entire Downtown Abbey series make you want to see more.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|The movie is good, the actors bring ou the characters of Oz well.  Seeing one of the worst and most scariest villains from my Childhood born anew took me back to that fright I had hearing that shrilly laugh when my mom popped in Wizard of Oz.  The story line is good for family and adults.<br />It is also a visually stunning film and I could not force myself to look away.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I just found this show and I really enjoyed Season 1. There are so many interesting characters. The show depicts small town life with charm, wit, and sensitivity. Will be watching Seasons 2 and 3 soon!
B00DHNBY02|3.0|The whole way through most horror/cult films is that you can see the ending coming and you know for sure who is going to survive at the end.<br /><br />As long as you did not read spoilers you will be surprised at the end.  Bruce Campbell left behind a good story and while it is not the same without him I am looking forward to more if it comes out.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|This addition to my bluray collection was awesome. It brought back my chilhood memories. Superb quality and a whole new world.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|So much better than the Hollywood perversion. A great ride. Non stop action. Superb twists. Ludlum was one of the best.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|After I got this I found out Candy Crush is not provided for Kindle Fires.  If Candy Crush is ever available I believe it will be helpful.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it. The subtle references to the original Star Trek trivia, such as the \\"red shirts,\\" were quite funny. Lots of action, twists and turns. It follows somewhat of a templated formula. But this isn't meant to be an art house movie. It is great fun scifi.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|fun game good controls good graphics good story line not just killing monsters good co-op and pvp good game get it
B001VPJZ36|5.0|The story is wonderful, the filming meticulously done.  But, the BIG win is what it teaches about problem solving, emotional maturity, and raw courage.  I can't think of a better source.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's nice to be able to take the bible with me everywhere I go!!  I can read it in traffic or in the doctor's office...
B00A285OOW|3.0|I liked the book. She developed the characters we know and love and know and hate well. I just wished the ending wasn't so abrupt.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|This season is good but I was a little disappointed the premiere episode  of the new season.  However can't miss a show and looking forward to season 5.
0446547573|5.0|I almost never cry when reading a book but this one got me! I love it way more than the movie. I actualy didn't even want to watch the movie because I thought it would ruin it for me but I finaly watched it about a year after a read the book and it wasn't terrible. Still its a great book. Definetly a page turner!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Kept my attention and was a good read.  Very good ending, did not see it coming.  I will read more of her books.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I don't like zombie like movies/tv shows at all or movies/tv shows based on comic books. I actually hesitated A LOT to start watching this but I am so glad i did! I love The Walking Dead!! and this season was the best season of any tv show out there!! So much emotion and thrill!! It's totally worth it!
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|WotD is an intense, 10-episode season which applies all of the technical mastery that the production staff has been honing since BaS. If you look carefully, there are still a couple if instances of green-screen-shadow, but these are easily overlooked in the wake of the other special effects, the casting, the story, the direction, the lighting, and the camera work. I am particularly impressed by the &#34;array camera&#34;.<br /><br />The action is virtually non-stop in this season, and the plots/schemes/betrayals are every bit as good at the first season. And, of course there is:<br /><br />!!!SAXA!!! - If you are an Ellen Hollman fan, you'll REALLY like this season. And let us not forget:<br /><br />!!!Naevia!!! - Cynthia Addai-Robinson does a magnificent job this season! As much as I enjoyed Lesley-Ann Brandt in BaS and GoA, I'm not sure she could have pulled off the rabid killing-machine that Naevia became this season.<br /><br />Simon Merrells is excellent as Marcus Crassus, Anna Hutchison does a fine job as Laeta, Christian Antidormi excelles as Tiberius, and Todd Lasance  is very good as an inappropriately blonde Julius Caesar (sorry, Ciaran Hinds now owns the role of Caesar, and blonde just doesn't work).<br /><br />I am a huge fan of commentary tracks, and there is commentary for every episode!<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of poorly-designed cardboard packaging, but I will refrain from deducting stars.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|While this book may not be full of beautiful prose it is a fun, unpredictable and enjoyable read! I recommend it.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|It has become one of my favorite albums! and definitely my current top listener! I hear it everyday in my car, and even my family started to listen to it because they loved her vibe and soothing voice. It is chill yet has a nice back-up beat that entertains you.<br />The sound is amazing and you can hear everything very clear. All the songs are good!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|All of his lyrics are poem.<br />I am lucky to live in the same generation with Justin and Moody Blues.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Her voice, the band, its sound- All Beautiful! You can tell this chic loves music. Her poetic lyrics are worth listening to, the energy in her strong voice, and the awesome instruments stand out. You  MUST pay attention to every song how she  includes the sounds of band. Definitely a good album to relax too yet jam to as well. You have a mix of &#34;slow&#34; songs with upbeat tempo ones as well.<br />The album name suits it PERFECTLY!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This is an instant American classic movie with some great acting by veteran and young actors. The youngest actors are at the center of this story and as they are just starting to notice girls, into their lives comes McConaughey's character with his troubled romance. As the story plays out, you can't help not to reflect back on your own ideas of what love was about when you were that age. McConaughey is definitely showing his range lately from &#34;Magic Mike&#34; to &#34;Dallas Buyers Club.&#34; I wouldn't be surprised to hear his name come awards season.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Well I can just say that both the movie and the story that took place was good, but most important is that the shipping was fast and simple and I'm looking forward for a pre oreder a new movies to come. Thank you amazon for your cooperation and for your commitment.  Sincerely yours, Julio Cesar Chavez
B005LLSZNM|5.0|the more I watched, the more I wanted to watch! each show has a twist that keeps you coming back for more. I did a marathon of all 5 seasons!
B003R0MF5S|5.0|Either you love chuck or you hate it. I happen to love it and the Chuck Season 4 bluray presents it in stunning HD quality!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|it broke my heart and it was well written. It was interesting to me since I grew up in Europe and not as much informed about that brutality of the white masters
0143116738|3.0|The book which delivered to me is a white one. It not the same book. But iti is OK for me, so I don't wanto change that.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Khan? Kirk saving the ship and getting radiated (instead of Spock)? Can't someone come up with an original story anymore? This was nothing but a remake of some old stories with a minor changes. Not worth the $4 I paid.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app. I use this one and another one interchangeably. great reference. like being able to have the Holy Bible available anywhere I go. I use it in Sunday School and during our church services.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I'm surprised to say that as someone who watched the Original Star Trek series as a child that I actually embrace the new cast.  I love the story and the effects but I am terribly, horribly upset, completely aghast at the departure of the historical story line of one character.This movie is supposed to be the beginning of the characters careers and it totally disregards the back story of one of the main characters.  And when I say &#34;back story&#34; I'm talking about what has already aired on the original Star Trek show some 45 years ago and the character appeared again in one of the Star Trek movies.  Inconsistancy is a crime in a series like this.  The Nemesis in the story also doesn't completely fit his back story (going forward story) but close enough that it wasn't troublesome.  And if the writers come back and say it's because past and future Spock are now in the same time line together so this altered everything else then I'll have to say that's a cop out and a lazy man's attitude.  The writers should be paying attention to detail.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love the Chromecast dongle, it's an inexpensive way to stream Netflix from my laptop, iPhone, or iPad at home. It's also portable, easy to set up, and streams in full HD video and audio. Glad I bought it and highly recommend.
B0002V7OI8|4.0|It's a very predictable but likeable story with a good cast of actors.  The effects are good and not hokey. Since there are several story lines running through it, it's not a movie you can wander in and out of the room doing dishes while watching.  I had forgotten this movie until I saw it online. I recommend it.
1451695195|5.0|You can't get any more real than this.  Let the skeptics be, they wouldn't believe if Jesus Himself talked to them and performed miracles before their eyes.  It's happened before.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I saw this movie as a teenager in the theatre when there weren't many scary movies like this at the time so it scared the pants off us.  (It came out before the original Friday 13th and Nighmare on Elm Street and before Halloween).  I just purchased it on DVD to replace my VHS copy.  If you're in your mid 50's or older you'll be able to relate to the story line and appreciate the movie.  Anyone younger will probably be disappointed because they can't get into the story.  The movie includes a young Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin.  You either love it or you don't.  It's an old fashioned psychological thriller with a bit of a twist.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Though story yet so unexpected, Never know what's next...so close to human nature as well! I loved this book! Highly recommend it
B00EZ50R04|5.0|\\"Insidious Chapter 2\\" is great! This is how the story goes: The horror team of director James Wan and writer/co-star Leigh Whannell reunite with the original cast of Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey and Ty Simpkins in INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2, a sequel to the acclaimed horror film, which follows the haunted Lambert family as they seek to uncover the mysterious childhood secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world.<br /><br />The cast led by Patrick Wilson (as Josh) & Rose Byrne (as Renai) is great. The directing by James Wan (also did the story) is great. The story by Wan & Leigh Whannell (also played the role of Specs) & screenplay by Whannell is great.<br /><br />The music by Joseph Bishara is great. The cinematography by John R. Leonetti is great. The film editing by Kirk M. Morri is great. The casting by Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy is great. The production design by Jennifer Spence is great. The art direction by Jason Garner is great. The set decoration by Lori Mazuer, set dressings by Daniel Vazquez & Nic Weethee is great. The costume design by Kristin M. Burke is great. The visual effects supervised by Ray McIntyre Jr. is great. The special make-up effects by Liz Briseno, Steve Costanza, Mark Garbarino & Kelly Golden is great. The stunts coordinated by Joel Kramer is great.<br /><br />This is a great, well-made and well-done horror movie sequel that is entertaining and intriguing. It is also, a well-crafted scary horror movie, as well. This is another great hit from James Wan (continuing his roll of hit horror movies starting with Insidious & The Conjuring), as well as, Leigh Whannell. This is one of the best horror movies of the year. It is also a great horror movie to watch on Friday the 13ths, which, ironically, it opened on.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Fantastic series, well deserving of the cult following it has had since it was first aired.  Joss W really created something timeless here -- it plays so well and is as fresh as if it were just created.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Great new band i came across, thank you Jimmy Kimmel. I am a 53 year old woman and like all types of music and this band is fab!
B00000IMTF|5.0|There isn't a bad song on this record.  At this point In his career, he could do no wrong.  All his songs with Rainbow, Black Sabbath and his own band were awesome.  They totally rocked and he had a voice that was made for hard rock/heavy metal.  Excellent record.  There are no bad tracks on this record.
B0054SMID0|5.0|. Love the Movie and the plot. Must see movie for entertainment.  Love the movies with prime membership and free.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|If you're thinking this is going to be Fast & Furious, you're dead wrong. It's a great art-house drama with excellent cinematography and a  moving soundtrack.  If you're not accustomed to this style of film, you may think that it's moving slow, but the slowness is often hypnotic and very intriguing.  The scenes where no words are exchanged are some of the most powerful.  Great film!
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Is there something wrong with level 10? I can't make it work at all.<br />Love the rest of the game.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|Love the movie. I know its far fetched to think a hooker can get a rich man to fall in love with her in a week but its a movie and its Julia Roberts and Richard Ger come on now.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My toddler son absolutely loves this show. It is very cute and appropriate for his age (1.5-2 years old). My four year old loves it, too.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|The app didn't have enough options when I went to use it. I don't really understand the buttons on it.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Awesome show. Def one of my favorite shows of all time. Make sure you watch the whole thing from start to finish.
B008469DGY|1.0|The app didn't have enough options to play when I went to use it. I don't really understand how to use it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|cool love the movie its a cool game you can run jump and roll defeat bad guys too try it you
B0089LOG02|5.0|Book moved quickly. I did prefer Vivian's story more so than the younger girls (cant remember her name). Thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Keeps me waiting for the next episode. Interesting characters and story lines. A lot better than some of the tv shows on today in prime time.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I liked the game but once the free version was over, I refused to pay $4.99 for a game. Too expensive.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|Very very very cute.  I like the graphics and my nephews absolutely love it.  Recommended for sure to keep them occupied!
1781162646|5.0|One of the best books of the year-King is at the top of his game.  More than a coming of age novel, not quite a romance or a crime drama but all of those with some creepiness thrown in for good measure.  College student Dev Jones takes a summer job at Joyland amusement park in 1973.  He meets a cast of 'carny' folk that are so well drawn and realistic I think King must have worked the circuit in the name of research.<br /><br />There is a ghost but this not a horror fest or even a story about a ghost.  It is a wonderful tale about the evil humans do to each other and also a bittersweet story of all the good things humans do as well.  Don't read this book expecting to have the bejeebers scared out of you, it's not that kind of story.  But rest assured that you will be disturbed by the way this book gets into your head and makes you think about life, love, death and what happens after it's all over.<br /><br />Stephen King is one of those rare authors that makes you rethink what you think you know.  After you read Joyland you will have an entirely different outlook on amusement parks!  5 stars
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|A must see for any one who loves to kill Zombies. Hypothetically!!! It's actually non stop excitement! Brad pitt does very well unlike his movie Troy...
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was awesome if you are into zombies. I don't know where the movie got off using the title of this book, they had absoutley nothing in common except the title. The book is a million times better.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|If you want the digital download, beware - the package I got had an expiration date of 5/31/13. I ordered it on 9/13/13 and paid extra for Saturday delivery specifically to get the download in time for a flight. Package arrived on Saturday the 14th but the download doesn't work. Amazon did offer to refund the order in full - after they first told me to contact the film studio.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|I found the series to be a bit confusing. I did not really understand the characters and the storyline. I watched several chapters but lost interest.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great read. Interesting plot and character development. Interesting premise for the plot. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really love Downton Abbey. It's very well written and the characters are exciting. I watched all three seasons and could not stop watching. Looking forward to Season 4.
0810945797|5.0|the illustrations and pictures were awesome and the background information to the characters was so well developed it reminded me of tolkiens hobbit world the continuity, the history and the woven inteaction and the interreliance of the characters was so interesting it made it seem like it was real.  what great thinking. a story and  movie well misunderstood by general public.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|it is a very fun game if you are looking for something to pass the time this is a great game to do so I like it and it is addictive :)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to learn more so I purchased this book.  My husband also read it and loved it.  I like that the author tried to get the real story whether or not it was flattering.  Sometimes, it wasn't.  I would love to learn more about the time period in which the original computers were developed.  The book (and Jobs' life) is inspiring in many ways.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  The streaming was flawless and I Loved that there were no commercials to disrupt my viewing of the movie.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I began to watch and couldn't stop till I had watched it all. Took days of course. But once you begin, it is so wonderful that you can't stop.
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Diving right into the next book!  Reminds me of 50 Shades of Grey! The only bad thing is nothing is getting done around the house!  lol
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it is even more fun to play on a large screen than my iPod. many hours wasted having fun playing this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series and am delighted to get it on Amazon Videos. Now I can watch on. My IPad while my husband is watching golf!
B00F35BV64|3.0|Keeps the trek story line going, great reference to original at the end. Good home entertainment for those of us that enjoy trek.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the other books by Nicholas Sparks that I have read. I read for pleasure and that is what these books give me
B00EAH3EQG|4.0|I looked for this album in America high and low and couldn't find it. An FYE worker said they don't carry it because its not a big seller. An maybe thats true since it debut at no. 70 on Billboard (maybe if people could get it there would have been a better charting position)...but its a great album so they really should carry it.<br /><br />If you like her first album well this is several times better and has a theme and different sound. More pop sounding but it has a lot to offer and its addicting! I could go on and on but please give it a try. She improved with Trouble.
B00CATONCA|5.0|ordered this from amazon in july, had to pay custom charges on this like on the other series 1/and 2 that i bought as well, however it arrived on saturday, via an extra cost to me. Anyway, on to the review, the box it's self is smaller than the series 2 rv zombie head version, it has great artwork on the box. The fish tank is pretty good as a visual piece, the zombie heads are quite large to the tank, they appear to be about the same size as the large 12 inch gi joe figures, an sport various sides of decay, overall it is quite a nice piece, a neat feture is the light up feature, with the hidden button on the front. one thing though the season 3 case will fit in the back of the tank but is a little tight when you want to remove it. The blu ray case has a nice soft feel to it, and is also plenty of character shots both inside and out of it. You also get the mannual for the fishtank, ie on/off button and battery info, the booklet has lots of cool details of future walking dead items from avatar items to card games.<br /><br />Overall i'm am very pleased with this style and package, not so with the custom charge, however i have watched and enjoyed both series 1/2 and currently watching series 3. Though limited and expensive, fans of the series will like or at least enjoy this edition. over the standard editions. this is a great series, and will cotinue to watch, and buy series 4, whatever variant that is as and when.<br /><br /> whichever version you go for, this is a great series, as you feel for the characters, rick, with the loss of his wife and looking after the group, and the threats from the governor, and both human and constant zombie threats, in each episode, which leaves you wanting to know what will happen next, episode by episode, season by season, and ultimatley how will it end, and where will the story go, and what will happen to them, in the future?
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Watch from the time I was young, not reruns then.  Great to have the whole series to watch anytime I want.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have not read this book yet. But, amazon keeps hound my inbox in gmail and keeps reminding me. I figure I'll just mark this as &#34;spam&#34;
B009LDD590|5.0|Bought as a Birthday gift.  My father loved it and was really surprised about the combo pack, he had only had the DVD's before.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I enjoy both Cher and Christina just by themselves, but the both of them in this movie was excellent! Cher's solo- &#34;You haven't seen the last of me&#34; is incredible to listen to.  Christina makes this movie fun and exciting to watch:)
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Awesome story and reflections of areas of the south that people don't realize still exist! Great underlying messages and what's happening with morals and parents today.
B0068FYZSE|5.0|Romantic and has dance, you can't go wrong:)  My daughter is in dance and loves this movie as do I. :)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this App. Use it every day; it is very informative and sometimes funny; a very good way to keep up with my friends and some of my family members.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I don't usually play card games on my kindle but I tried this one and love it. I can't seem to put it down. It is challenging and fun. I also got my husband hooked on it.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Very good program,easy to synch with the computer, I love it and use it quite often. Thank you for posting it.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I loved the film, it reminded me of the prisons we make for ourselves in our minds...I have been in such a state for a while now, not being able to shake it...then I watched the movie and made my own prision break. Felt great for the first time in a long time.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Not an easy program to use. Deleted it from my item.  It did not work as I expected it to. Not user friendly at all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So many surprises, totally unexpected twists and turns.  Hugh Bonneville is brilliant in creating a family that you really care about.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Extremely creative & atypical beats, Kanye's flow is among the strongest of his career on this record. The first three songs showcase why he claims to be a musical genius: he is.
0345803507|4.0|Great read, but now I want more and I want to read the perspective of christian....that sneak peak at the end was a good teaser amd now I want more.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|same basic game play as the first chapter. I think so far this story line is more interesting. the graphics. are the same. I am only on the third chapter so I hope we get to the island soon.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|This arrived quickly.  Bought as a gift and they have enjoyed it.  Movie was good as I saw it at the movies.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Sad i missed it the first time. Love all the characters. Trying to watch all seasons before the current one begins.
B001MSMULG|5.0|This is a suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyable read!  Prior to reading the Kill Artist, I mistakenly read The English Girl, my first experience with Daniel Silva' cleverly sculpted plots.  Now that I've had the opportunity to watch the evolution of the characters and plot from the beginning, I know I'll continue to fill in the blanks from its inception.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved all seasons. Cannot wait for season 4.  Thank you Prime Enjoyable, Entertaining, and good storylines and the acting is good
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game it is fun and easy.keeps me and my neice and nephew entertained for hours. similar  to subway surfer but so much more fun with minions
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My cousin liked/loves this game. She plays it almost every day when she has the free time. I personally like this game.
B00271B752|5.0|Unlike a lot of the people on here, I didn't decide to watch this because of Al Pacino, I decide to watch it because having heard the story as a child I figured the movie wouldn't do it justice. After seeing it though, I must say it was great! And I'm damn proud to be a Serpico!
0345548981|4.0|This rather slim volume is a combination autobiography/motivational/how-to book (light on the autobiography, heavier on the motivation and how-to) in which Djokovic explains how he went from good to great. His humble beginnings as a child in the war-ravaged country of Serbia, along with his incredible success as a professional tennis player and his exquisite physical shape, lend his story credibility, but this book tells his story only briefly--the real focus here is his conditioning and the enormous impact that a gluten-free diet has had on his performance. Nevertheless, his advice is descriptive rather than prescriptive--he tells what's worked for him, and he encourages the reader to discover his/her own formula for dietary success. There's no denying that adopting a gluten-free diet will be a challenge, yet Djokovic (together with the professional chef with whom he works) provides practical suggestions and recipes to help the reader transition into a gluten-free lifestyle. And lifestyle is the right word here--as Djokovic insists, diet and exercise are just two of the important components in his plan. He also stresses the importance of adequate sleep and mental conditioning. All in all, it's a decidedly quick read (I got through it in less than a day), but it contains helpful insights for healthier living.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Very in depth view of the history of ultra running including anthropological info.  Sounds dry but was surprisingly interesting. In the beginning I wasn't sure if it was fiction or non-fiction (non-fiction).
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|They did get it RIGHT in never having the helmet removed from Dredd's head.  However the dreamy slow-mo got repetitive and BORING.  The violence was at a level of incomprehensible and stupid.  I was bored - though it was better than Stallone's movie.
B003B02PF4|5.0|Although there were quit a few characters I never lost track of the story. Mr Grisham has a way of pulling you into the story so that you can relate and almost become the main character, I could feel his nervousness, at times my legs hurt from all the walking he did. I have already told my husband he has to read &#34;The Broker&#34;, totally entertaining and makes you wonder, would our government do something like that to one of its citizens?
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I've watched it twice now, first in 2D and then in 3D and found it even more entertaining the second time around. When I watched it the first time I didn't really think about the scenes that would emphasize the 3D effect but when I watched it in 3D it became clear why they had been photographed the way they had. I must admit I found myself dodging spears in the 3D version.<br /><br />I've begun to grow accoustomed to the new cast of characters and I'm not really sure why that may be. I don't know if they're adapting to their roles better or I've just gotten a little more used to seeing them in those roles. Regardless the new cast is less of an issue now than it was in their first movie and I was better able to simply enjoy the story and the movie. This is probably only my imagination but the younger versions of the characters are beginning to remind me more of their more familiar older versions.<br /><br />One bit of trivia that I found interesting was the introduction of Carol; the one who becomes the mother of Kirk's son David. Star Trek fans will already know how that ends.<br /><br />I must admit I'm looking forward to seeing what the next installment may bring.
B00DQVST76|4.0|I have read all the reviews on this DVD but seems most of the issues are with the BLU RAY version. So I got the DVD and picture and Audio are great. I was looking for diffects in the DVD but concluded that nothing was wrong with the DVD. I will say it was over editing and took away some of the tour expierence but all and all it was AMAZING DVD. Hope this helps . If you want better luck I would go for the DVD.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Not only is the music wonderful, but the acting was superb. I hope there really are homes such as this one
B000S1M9LY|1.0|Too late, I read a recommendation that someone curious about David Foster Wallace start with some of his shorter work, not (for example) Infinite Jest. That might have saved me a lot of time had I read it earlier.<br /><br />I suppose I can see why some people would like his work in general and this book in particular. It's definitely a distinctive voice. It just happens to be distinctive in a way that I found tedious, rambling, and generally annoying. Footnotes referencing other footnotes that reference other footnotes. Long stream of consciousness passages that go nowhere. Only the vaguest hint of a plot attempting to hold it all together (and not really succeeding) with loads of threads going nowhere.<br /><br />Very disappointing, given all the praise I'd heard for it. Though, again, I can understand why something so different earns such extreme reactions.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|I loved this movie as it actually had a lot of drama with a lot of romance.  Wish there were more of these
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Hard-shelled father, with true love and devotion for his daugher who is taken by a ruthless slavery business.....suspense, action, vengeance, redemption...it has it all
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Reading for a book club. Not my typical reach but better than I thought it would be. Good to go out of the typical reading shelf now and again. I would recommend it to anyone. At least give it a try!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|A very realistic insight to life in prison and how an upper middle class woman copes with it in spite of the socioeconomic differences
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Bored. Lost interest and didn't bother to finish it. I used to like science fiction. It started out okay and then I realized I didn't care about the characters.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Nice - exciting and well portrayed unusual characters. Creeping excitement that holds it grip to the very last page. A must for all crime readers!
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|I thought this was a really good movie even though it did deviate from the book.  For the record, I really enjoyed the book but liked the movie as well.<br /><br />For fans of the book, any sequel would probably have to follow the book very closely since it would likely be the 'War' part of the book. It would probably start a few years later when the decision to reclaim the land occupied by Zack was made.<br /><br />Even though there's a vaccine I find it very unlikely that humans would allow zombies to occupy most of the cities of the world.  Guess I'll have to wait a few months to find out when a sequel is going to be.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout is a funny, charming writer who makes the Law of Attraction easily understood. The experiments are easy and fun to do. Many of my friends are using this also and we love sharing our stories with each other. I would even say that this book can be life-changing to those who apply the methods described. I absolutely love it!
0307591549|4.0|Achor writes in an engaging style.  He has many case studies to back up his findings.  Several practical &#34;things to do&#34; from this great look at being positive and developing character building habits.  It's a great book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Engrossing and intense , well written  always kept me  on edge. Plausible story with enough  characters tolerated story inlb detail
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really love this game! I enjoy playing it when ever I can. It's a great time passer game! 5 stars :)
B006PIXKVW|5.0|At the start, I thought it was going to be a cartoon and was disappointed but it was a wonderful movie!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|more rooms please.  this went by way too quickly but it was fun if you like puzzle games.  free so why not try it
B00D6C0D42|5.0|Trace the origins of Gilliam's feisty dark comedy to this movie. I will always think of Michael Palin covered in blood. &#34;Care for some necrophilia?&#34;
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is the funniest thing I have ever read. It is great. A sneak peek into the self proclaimed player male mind. I love it! Drew is awesome and Kate is his perfect match. Read this book when you just need a pick me up. I was laughing out loud in my office when I should have been working. People thought I was crazy. Happy reading!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It sucks you in and cant put it down. You really feel like this happened and was living it threw all the people one story at a time. Love Max Brooks and im a bigger fan after this book.
0670451495|5.0|I purchased this for my niece. She is expecting her first baby. She grew up in Boston but now lives in Philadelphia. I want my great-nephew Ben to know about his Boston roots. It is also such a classic student read-aloud book.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Action packed straight out of the packet, whimsical but generally highly predicable.<br />Worth the price of admission for an evenings entertainment
B007SGM084|5.0|It was great, definitely an easy read and I'm looking forward to the movie! Wish it would have continued a little further at the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is awesome. I love being able to stream music as well my movies from all my devices. Very portable.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I've played this game across various flash sites for the past couple years.  I had no idea this had been ported to Android until it hit as FAOTD.  This port retains all the elements of the original, and works smoothly on my Acer A700.  It's the kind of game that gives you satisfaction because you -can- complete it, but it isn't so easy that you won't need to restart a level (sometimes more than once).  If you're not getting this as FAOTD, check around the web for the flash version to help make up your mind.  If the flash sites worked better on my tablet I probably wouldn't have even wanted this.  As it is, there's a good chance I would have bought it had I known it existed before today.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Wow we can all learn from this.<br /><br />Powerful and real life<br />You can change someone's life if you allow yourself to believe and do some thing about it
B004HWYTP4|5.0|great movie, great cast great action. loved it. recommend it to anyone who really enjoys action and fun at the same time.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Fun fun fun fun fun PLAY THIS GAME! It is totaly epic and awesome PLAY IT NOW i'm serious have fun and enjoy
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|whenever I try to open up the single player levels, my game crashes and returns to my home screen, I tried redownloading. either this gets fixed or someone tell me how to fix it
B008XKSW7M|2.0|typical new style Hollywood disappointment.... nothing beats the old productions.  tasteless script and bad acting... just pathetic all the way around.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I found this box set well worth the price.  Even if you watched the episodes on T.V.  you<br />can still find parts you missed originally.  I found the deleted scenes fun and the episodes<br />entertaining the second time around.
B00CTT9646|5.0|First off the phaser's design and heavy construction are right on... second the movie is a perfect for the second saga of the new Star Trek series of movies... looking forward to more to come!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this app is easy to use and has great graphics and good interaction.  it does have a few drawback in that the first few levels you can use up your energy quickly.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoyed trying Bingo, & will play it a lot more. A few things i didnt understand, but im sure ill figure it out
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Great CD, Steel playing is GREAT, Great choice of songs, just can't go wrong with Buck & The Hag... GET IT ..
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy to access all e-mail accounts.<br />Would like to be able to hide left column to read e-mail more easily.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|This book includes a wide range of silly and highly entertaining short stories. Some are written in script form whilst others follow a more conventional narrative structure, yet none of the tales are run of the mill.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed the most in this book were some of the stories which draw on recognisable characters and settings such as the minotaur and the labyrinth, and then twists in the tale into something new which leaves you reeling with laughter.<br /><br />There is such a range of humour and story within these pages that it is impossible for there not to be something to please everyone. Each tale is a bite-sized portion which makes it the perfect companion for the bedside table or lunch break laugh.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Like how easy matching/dropping cards can be.<br />Card faces are easy to see/move<br />1-suit game is what I use to wake up.
B00BJTGVTK|5.0|This book contains a wonderful collection of short stories for children. Each story is individual but has a reassuring tone and a message for children to take away with them.<br />Some of the stories are about animals, others about people but they are all believable characters and their tales are interestingly woven.<br />These stories are of a good length to retain children's interest and engagement. They are also written in a traditional style as to be appropriate to adults wishing to regain some feel of childhood.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Great show, loved it. Excellent cast and a great series of directors, check it out, you'll love it too. Thank you.
B005OP7162|5.0|I don't typically watch many television shows, however was where my love for the show began.  I'm still watching into the 3rd season.
B00631HASU|4.0|Good graphics, good game play, nice music.<br /><br />Took off one star because on the Kindle Fire HD, the text fonts are pretty small.  If there's an option to change the font size, or reduce the border size, I can't find it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|You'll want to clear your schedule for a few hours because you won't be able to stop watching after just one episode.  I don't watch much television, however this series is one of my favorites.  Just when you think you have it figured it out, another twist is revealed.  Great show, looking forward to Season 3!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Better written than Bared To You...emotionally pulls you into several story lines that whets the appetite for the final book!
B0055D3EFU|5.0|Love a good scary movie and this was definatley one of those. Bought this to watch the day before Insidious 2 hit theatres as I had not seen it before and was not dissapointed.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Really fun for all ages! My 3 oldest sons love this game as do I and the rest of my family
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Well, after a couple hours, two TV sets, a Windows 7 computer, an Android tablet, and two routers at two different houses, I still have yet to set this thing up. This product was released way too early.<br /><br /> By the way, you would think a CHROMEcast would work with standard CHROMEbooks, not just the Pixel model, wouldn't you? I think I will return it. I wish I had researched this a little more carefully before buying.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|this movie is EXCELLENT!  It has world class actors in it and it tells a classic story about a man fighting for a cause in which he truly believes.  Ioan Gruffudd and Benedict Cumberbatch are both wonderful in this movie!!
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan takes a no-nonsense scholar's look at the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth and the spread of the Christianity from an anti-Roman sect in the ancient holy land to a Rome-based worldwide religion. What makes it special is that it is so approachable. If you take up this book with a lack of bias you will learn a lot about the man and the myths. But it's not a book for everyone. Fundamentalists will be offended. . . and I say that's OK.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is a good movie. Great action and special effects. My only problem with the movie is the when the actors are finished speaking their lips are still moving. The talking and the lip movement are not in sync. It is off by just little, but still noticeable. Hopefully Paramount will re-release the film and fix this problem.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Like the movie, have not seen the first one and plan to do so! Movie had action, funny and a bit of caring in there! Actors are really getting old but so are the fans that enjoy seeing them :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is great to keep your brain thinking!! want to keep your memory skills working?( this is the game for you!)Lot's of fun figuring out the puzzles!
B008602KQI|5.0|Had heard about it and was told about the books though I have not read! Great action, story line and acting
B00CY5Y37U|5.0|this special addition cd contains runaway horses album, remixes originally released with the singles and some pictures of the runaway horses era, plus the videos of the singles plus in interview on the making of the album, the best part for me was a remix of valentine, a pumped up, tricked out version of the original, just the remix version of valentine was worth the buy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game. me, my boyfriend, and our friend play it for hours! we try to beat each others score
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Lame and predictable, makes you walk out off from TV after 15 minutes of watching. Extremely gruesome with poor acting of Sylvester Stallone knockoff
B00F35BV64|5.0|I was so excited to see this movie and it didn't disappoint! I really hope they make another one soon!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this little game. Fun enough for me &amp; my little guy to play! It always is different when you have  to replay
B00000J7JO|5.0|I love the album!  The Red Hot Chili Pepper have come a long way since their first album.  Highly recommended.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Great movie, but the plot is not as well developed as the first. Some of the final scenes mirror &#34;return of khan&#34;, but it's well done... Though I did have a bit of déjà vu.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I just download the update and I can't play the game it tries to start and the goes right back to the icon.  I tried to contact the game developer and I have not heard a word!!!!! Very disappointed!!  When are you going to fix this problem!!!!!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Than weather bug. Radar images larger and love the time lapse.  Removed weather bug and will use this app instead.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I see why teens would really like this book and why the themes work for adults too.  I thought it was well-written and interesting to read.
B00D8WTBNY|4.0|Hesitation Marks is an interesting album. In recent years Trent Reznor has been taking NiN in a slightly different direction from the albums and tracks that made the band's name. This album, whilst continuing that trend somewhat, does pay homage to the NiN of old.<br /><br />The album makes a fantastic start - the first two songs after the intro Eater of Dreams are cracking. Copy of A and Came Back Haunted hark back to the good old days of NiN, giving a nod to albums such as The Downwards Spiral and The Fragile. Songs afterwards lean more towards the new-look NiN that Reznor has shaped since With Teeth. Satellite is the<br />stand-out track from these 'fresher' offerings; it has some insanely catchy loops and grows on you with each listen.<br /><br />Hesitation Marks is much less aggressive than early NiN; Reznor has matured and grown through his younger angsty phase and this is reflected in the lyrics he has penned. Not all fans will appreciate this change in direction, however. Musically the album carries a cleaner, crisper sound that may also irk some fans; Everything is so far removed from the NiN that we all know and love that, without Reznor's recognisable vocals, we could mistake it for a completely different band. It is almost poppy in its construction at times.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition of Hesitation Marks comes with a second CD that contains three remixes from the album. In truth I was unimpressed with these offerings. The remix of Find My Way has its moments but they are unfortunately choked to death by too much uninspiring filler.<br /><br />Overall this is definitely an album all Nine Inch Nails fans should check out. It contains a handful of tracks that will get any long-time admirers reminiscing about the 'good old days' and I personally rate it more highly than With Teeth, The Slip and Year Zero.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Exceptional. It is great to have the medical world meet up with the spiritual world. I am recommending this book to everyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I can't watch anything else! this season is excellent just like the previous ones! Fantastic show, prepare to ignore everyone! :)
B000I0XLYO|5.0|Love the entire cast!!!  Some unexpected, but excellent actors.  Ben Stiller is brilliant.....every time I watch his movies they get funnier :-)
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I loved this app. It was very addicting. I am disappointed that I have finished all the levels. I wish there was more levels to do.
B0053O89IS|5.0|This was a gift and the recipient was quite happy to be getting it : )<br /><br />Nothing else to say about this one.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|One brief moment in time catapults a novel that keeps you spellbound. Cannot believe how it all ties together from such seemingly disjointed stories.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Amazing! There are no other words to describe my reading this entire series in almost one sitting. An absolute must read.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|Great action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat with surprises and twists throughout!  Blu-Ray version delivers even more entertainment and quality~
B0000062Y2|5.0|THIS BROUGHT BACK SO MANY MENORIES IT WAS THE FIRST BIG PRODUCTION MUSICAL I DAD EVER SEEN.  THESE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES BETERRN THE SHOW AND THE MOVIE AND I ENJOYED THEM BOTH
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The key to reading this book is an abundance of tissues. It was a fantastically, heartwarming story that touched me deeply.
B00005JLR2|5.0|IT IS NOT QUITE ROBERT LOUI STEVENSON AND IS SET FAR IN THE FUTURE, BUT IT IS FUN TO WATCH AND THE STORE IS INTERESTING, AND OF COURSE THE ENDING IS QUITE SURPRISING.
B00464CU7M|5.0|Katerine Jenkins Believe - Live from the O2 Is a great representation of the talents that Ms Jenkins has. It is well presented and explores all levels of her voice with great assistance of dancers, acrobates and musicians.I recommend it to all who enjoy an outstanding concert headlined by one of the great young singers - Katherine Jenking.
1435122968|5.0|Just picked this up last night at a local Barnes and Nobles and was able to find the corrected 2011 edition. I don't think anyone should have a problem getting the correct edition because I imagine all the 2008 editions have all been disposed by now. The book itself is wonderful....beautiful front cover of what obviously seems to be some psychedelic outer space landscape. Perfect timing too I must say....I can't think of a better way to spend these bleak and dreary autumnal days than to laboriously pour through this monstrous text of stories filled to the brim of the macabre and other other worldly nightmares.<br /><br />**I know this doesn't directly pertain to the review, but It's interesting because where this book was in B&N was a plethora of other inspired books from other authors. B&N have their own series out call \\"Leatherbound Classics\\" compiling 95 books ranging from Sherlock Holmes, Shakespeare, Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Edgar Allen Poe (complete tales and poems!), Mark Twain..etc. All with the stylish and creative leather bound design. Definitely check it out because B&N is killin' it right now!**
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Richard Castle and Detective Beckett have taken character development to a new level. This romantic story line is the best on TV EVER. Better than Ross and Rachel.
1451668945|5.0|I always enjoy books by the author, Mary Higgins Clark.  She writes great mysteries.  This book met all my expectations.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Just go buy it and read it. See if you don't think it's one of the best stories ever! For me, it's up there with Gayle Forman and John Green's books. Just One Day this year was one of those books that still has an effect on me. Anything John Green writes does that. I've had to start a new shelf. Special, Special Books. Anne Ursu also goes on that shelf. And so does Rainbow Rowell.<br /><br />The characters in this novel I loved them. I was jumping a little trying to edge Cath a little bit pushing her to go just a little bit further whether it was with her dad, Wren, Simon/Baz or Levi. I just wanted her to succeed at everything she tried. She just needed someone to pull her out of her shell, her tiny little world and somehow, she got paired with people that would help her with that.<br /><br />Levi, just like his name says, he's like a comfortable pair of old blue jeans. He's relaxed, broken in, easy going. He just seems to know what to say all the time. He's always smiling. He's, as Cath says, \\"like a Golden Retriever\\". I want Levi the Golden Retriever. He is absolutely the sweetest boyfriend I've ever read about. And thankfully Cath and Levi are drama free. And yet so captivating and engrossing.<br /><br />Then there's Cath's and Wren's relationship with each other, with their dad, with their mom, it's just so much about relationships. And there is a badass roommate that definitely would have scared me off my first year of college named Reagan that Cath lives with.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell just seems to know people and how to write them so well. Being inside of Cath's head, it was so comfortable and when I thought I knew everything about her and how she felt, she still surprised me. I love Cath!<br /><br />And her fanfiction...I don't read fanfiction I have so much to read already. I've bought hundreds of books I haven't read yet. But I might start. I loved the Simon Snow fanfiction and he wasn't even a real story! I loved it!! I couldn't wait to read the stories.<br /><br />This is just an amazing story about college, about facing new and scary things. About leaving home and some of the pitfalls of that first year. Of first love and how scary that can be. And about living life by your own rules and other people being okay with that. You don't have to change who you are to be liked. And maybe your brand of crazy isn't that crazy at all. It's an amazing story that all lovers of contemporary YA and YA romance will love. Did I say I love this story? Did you get that?<br /><br />I received a copy of this novel from the publisher for review through NetGalley. I was not compensated for my review. All opinions expressed are my own.<br /><br />This is just an amazing story about college, about facing new and scary things. About leaving home and some of the pitfalls of that first year.

B001NHNG64|4.0|Child does a good job of describing action sequences.  Could use a little more detail in building plot.  Sometimes tough to follow people.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Moyes' writing style is engaging and accessible. She made me consider what life would be like as a paraplegic, as a person who loves or cares for a paraplegic and when or if a person should have a right to die. Our book club discusses this nex week. I can't wait for the discussion!  The characters are complex and I had a hard time putting the book down.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|The family likes this movie.  The only issue is that the digital copy certificate was expired.  Amazon took care of the problem and is great to work with!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|pretty darn awesome!...i love these type of games with different puzzles and looking for objects to complete another scene...even my friends think its awesome. they love the story and creepiness of the game.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I love it! It' excellent quality and extremely cool. The lefty buttons are not an issue at all for a righty. This is by far my best watch now!!!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|GREAT QUALITY!ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE EVER. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY .LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW PART OF THIS MOVIE.
140006922X|5.0|I thought it was a very informative book, very well written, transforming a complex subject into a spell- binding story. I understand that this might not reflect the latest research in this field, but gives an excellent introduction to the layperson.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very different from my normal .... took a bit to get &#34;into it&#34; but it is well worth it.  Well done Yann Martel.
B00ET7ICEQ|3.0|There are a couple of catchy songs, but the bulk of the album sounds a lot like whining, both in lyrics and sound.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it is my favorite game to play you should play it to v tv I am going to keep playin
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|We had so much fun we restarted it. The kid s an rd I play it as a family game.great levels barbarity.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|Despite the product description this truck is mostly plastic. if your kids will put it on a shelf and stare at it then its fine. If they will actually play with it then it will surely break. Its way too expensive for a cheaply made product. buy something else.
B008469DGY|2.0|It requires t o get to many points to move on. There I s no finishing the holes unless it is hole in one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Yes this game rules like Daniel Bryan YES YES YES YES YES YES get  the game or your a chump y r u still here reading my comment get the game go over their u chump  press download NOW
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It took me awhile to read and idk y cuz I couldn't put it down! Read the series. It has everything in one! Vampires,werewolves and a whole new type of species called shadowhunters Cray Cray. I'm an aspiring author(writing a new series first book going to be called  through the eyes of a vampire) um and I hope to get have also much success like Cassandra Clare. Read.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|I think it is probably a fun game, but I have not done a good job of figuring it out yet.  But then I am older and not a kid anymore.  A young person most likely would not have any problem at all.
1447231171|5.0|It was great reading.  I enjoyed it very much.  Jeffery Archer is one of my very favorite authors.  I will read more of his books.
B00CVPAJ94|4.0|Rented this movie & loved it. decided to go online and buy it, found it on Amazon. Received it quick! Good quality :)
B00062PN6I|5.0|Do not allow the fact the headphones are light trick you this are great. They fit well and sound even better the bass is amazing and for me that's great (bass player). Also the twist off adaptor is a great design and quility. I also watch tv and listen to music with so very multi-purpus so if you need some good headphones buy these i've payed more for phones that could not tuch these in anyway but don't go jogging or anything with these becasuse you will only hear music. Sorry for typeos and spelling
B000TO0T4O|5.0|Enjoyed very much. Gripping. One of the best books ever. Stayed up until 2 reading it. Buying the next one.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read the first book and was intrigued by the character of Christian Grey. I'm usually not into sexually explicit books, so I didn't expect to like this series. However, I was drawn in by the story, wondering where it would go next.<br /><br />Once I finished Book 1, I immediately downloaded Book 2 (since Book 1 ends on a bit of a cliffhanger).<br />And, I was immediately drawn into Book 2. I enjoyed it more than Book 1. It's very hard to put down. As the story progresses, I kept wondering what would happen next. I even stayed up until 5 a.m. because I couldn't wait to see how it ended! (haven't done that for a long time)<br /><br />And, without giving anything away, the story took the path that I hoped it would take after reading Book 1. Can't wait to see what happens in Book 3 (I'm downloading it right now).
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I missed this one and went back to find it after I'd seen the second one in theatres.  Great movies.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|A book that you won't put down. The narration takes us through a journey from ori single cell origins to our current state of complex and divers creatures.<br />Amazing intersection of fossil record, anatomy and embryonic development.
B0042UEU8M|3.0|Not bad for a chick flick. It was worth the watch. Story was a bit out there but it was entertaining
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting so if you are looking for a game is fun and addicting this game is for you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is very fun and a experience to those who dream of taking care of a horse in there future.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved catching up waiting for the new season.  Clear video and sound.  Will be watching  all 3 seasons again, soon.
B00ECUX7HC|3.0|.....thought &#34;ok, that was nice&#34;, and put it in the cabinet.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on why it just laid there while I was listening to it.  Band is tight, Susan's still got a great voice...then it occurred to me....these are amazingly uninteresting songs.  There's just nothing in them to grab you....<br /><br />And, it makes me sad, because I'm a big Susan fan<br /><br />Suggest you wait for the price to go down.<br /><br />Sorry
B002KKCVQE|5.0|This is a light weight, comfortable sandal. It fits well using the 3 velcro strap system to conform to your foot. Out of the box, it feels like a part of your feet. I have a pair of Keens which preform well, but are heavy, and do not fit as well.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This book became a movie and I never wanted to see it because it looked scary....and not my type of movie. But this book got quite a few 5 stars and great reviews...so I tried it and was amazed and thrilled to read it. Yes it was a bit scary...but intriguing. It takes place on an island, where there is a facility that keeps insane and psychotic individuals and tries to help them either with meds, or worst a lobotomy. Or so the story makes you believe. Two federal marshals are sent in to investigate the escape of one of the inmates and things do get hairy....especially when a hurricane comes, knocks out the electric and the inmates run wild. But then the book takes a different turn and we find out the real reason the agents are there....or were they? No spoilers here but I would say this is a must read...you will love the twist and surprise.
032147404X|2.0|Tips and suggestions (one per page), but really nothing to teach you anything about the really important stuff - the basics of creative photography and using your camera beyond the automatic dial. I like Scott and he's done a lot for digital photography and Photoshop, but I would NOT recommend this if you want to get serious about your photography. Regretfully, the same goes for the entire series, and I've got all of them. I do commend Scott for getting some many people interested in Photoshop and photography.
B0083Z614S|4.0|A classic story about children over coming adversity.  A fun read with a good ending.  I recommend this story to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm not big into television watching, but this series has me hooked.  My mother told me about it and after I had some surgery done, I had to lay in bed and I started watching this series.  Wonderful acting and wonderful story.  Definitely recommend!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Full disclosure: I'm a big fan of this genre. From the first movie to the last (at least in this package), I've liked them all. The concept, the futility, the overall design of the alien - all of it appeals to me.<br /><br />That being said, this anthology, which does not include the latest movie - the prequel - is an excellent example of what combo sets could and should look like. Many raters tend to downgrade a movie release because the movie house fails to release x, y, or z along with the movie. I'm not saying they are wrong - as I imagine they are likely collectors who want to see the floor room footage or the extended scenes or whatever it is they feel the publisher failed to add. I, however, buy movies for the sheer enjoyment they bring me. If I find myself flipping channels and stopping on a movie that was made a decade or two ago on a channel that will interrupt me every 15-30 minutes with commercials and still sitting through it, then most likely that movie will make the cut to purchase as soon as a good deal comes along.<br /><br />The Alien Anthology is just that deal. This brings you the best of the Alien series (yes, there could have been more of this or that added, but as stated, I simply wanted the movies) and all in a great package design. The movies come in a sleeve that is designed to look like a book. At first, when I opened my box I thought I had received the wrong item - as I didn't see the normal plastic cases with DVDs/Blu-Rays in them. Then I started flipping through the artwork and realized the discs were firmly nestled and integrated directly into the artwork. What a novel concept! H.R. Giger, the designer/artist behind the Alien look, would be proud (imho).<br /><br />As for the movies - they are still as good today as they were when I originally viewed them in theaters, on VHS, on DVD, on prime time television and now on Blu-Ray. No, I don't believe that they made &#34;vast&#34; improvements to the footage by converting it to Blu-Ray, but it is still a joy to watch. You get a few nice extras on the blu-ray discs, but I'll leave that type of review to those that find the extras to be what makes/breaks a collection, as I never tend to click on those extras anyway.<br /><br />My only concern and only time will tell if it is warranted, is that the discs are firmly seated in this book format. I can see the potential for the discs to scratch as you pull them in/out of the book. I may be a bit overly sensitive on this mater, as discs have been getting better and better over the years, but I figured it was worth mentioning - if you are the type to watch these movies weekly, you may want to protect your asset a little better and put them in something a bit easier to access.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a great collection and if you happen to score a great deal (like I did on a Gold Box day), you'll be happy to have picked up this wonderful alien themed movie anthology.t it is still a joy to watch.

B005FDW7AI|5.0|Love this movie. Possibly my favorite movie as a child and still a top as an adult. I could barely watch the shirley temple one. This version is so much better.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This app is awesome I love the new &quot;Emerald City&quot;<br />....If I could only get through it .... Can't wait to see what they come up with next...
B009RX85N0|5.0|There are FAR more complete reviews on this DVD set listed here, so I won't waste your time.<br /><br />Buy this set!<br /><br />This is a fun, inventive and entertaining show.  Well written, well acted and for an inclusive audience.  The kids will be entranced by the familiar fairy tales and the more mature themes, and the adults will be entertained by the twists and turns, the adult scripting and inventive plotting.  A show that is truly FOR the entire family, without pandering to one generation or leaving the other one out.  If it was on HBO, there would be language and nudity, and probably a little less creativity.  On ABC, they make it work better without going to extremes (which I often like!).<br /><br />The *only* down side is the CGI, which sometimes is a tad sub-par.  THAT said, if this show is already VERY expensive, and a bigger effects budget would kill the series.  It is easy to get past the effects - you can make allowances for all the other things going for the show.  The CGI is not TOO bad, it is just you come to expect the best when faced with such an embarrassment of riches here!<br /><br />And the second season is even better than the first!
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|I did enjoy this movie,despite its many flaws.for instance,who in the heaven will check in his/her briefcase on a flight?another mind boggling scene ,was that he just left the hospital twice,without paying the bills.other questionable scenes were ,why did the assassin engage him to a fistfight,instead of just killing him ,with a gun he was carrying ,and why did the female taxi driver found them easily at the near end of the flick.berlin is a cosmopolitan city and has hundreds of roads/streets.he also left the hotel before checking in, without informing his wife,where was he going.this was very odd !these are just some of the flaws ,but there are more!
1781162646|4.0|My husband is reading this paperback book because he is a Stephen King follower. He has many of his books and really enjoys reading them...He has not finished this book but so far like it.....
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Of the supergroups that have formed throughout the years, I'd stack this up against any of them this side of Cream. Kotzen was not well known but possesses soulful singing and tremendous guitar skill. Sheehan and Portnoy form the best rhythm section ever assembled, bar none. Both are amazing musicians and show their skills but do so within the context of the song. Not sure how long they will stick together, but this is really a great band and warrants a listen by rock fans and, especially, musicians.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I live this I just wish I had gotten it when I had gotten my kindle fire but I am glad I have it now
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This book was an assigned reading for my 10th grade daughter and we read it together. It was a very interesting look at factors which play a part in phenomenal success and experiences. There is a great amount of science which backs up what is presented here and this book lays it out in a way which is interesting and accessible.
0385344228|5.0|Was mesmerized from page 1! This novel kept me on my toes yearning for more. Well written & highly recommended for those who appreciate a true mystery!
B00177YA1K|1.0|BUYER BEWARE!  It appears some of the reviewers commented on the wrong package.  They write about a Disc 2, but this product ONLY has Disc 1.  There is no Disc 2, even though the packaging implies that there is a Disc 2, citing special features.  However, to watch the Special Features, you have to insert Disc 2, but there is no second disc.  I did not buy the first two movies until after the third one hit the market.  Needless to say, I was quite disappointed to find out I was short-changed for what I thought I was getting.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|There are 3 interwoven plots that are each interesting on their own. I liked the way all the pieces come together near the end.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|The writing and story made this an easy and captivating read.<br /><br />I loved Ender from his beginning in Ender's Game and loved meeting him again in this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is extremely well written and impossible to put down.  Will be looking for more of liane moriartys books!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I enjoyed Born and Raised quite a bit, but this album in some ways tops that one. It offers a more mellow beat, and for me had more enjoyable tracks than B&R; most notably, 'Wildfire', 'Call me the Breeze', and 'Badge and Gun' among my favorites. If you enjoyed B&R, this album offers more.
0307341550|5.0|A page turner that will leave you wanting more! I was intrigued from beginning to end. Gillian Flynn ceases to amaze me with her talent to thrill and tantalize.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Really good reboot for the Star Trek of the original series.  All the characters are back, story line on target.  It's a tribute to the original series and very well done.
0812550706|3.0|I read this book for class, and found it very intriguing. It's a very psychologically-motivated science fiction novel, with very showing and a lot of telling. It's because of that showing-to-telling ratio that I can only give this book 3 stars, and I also think the whole subplot involving Ender's siblings was kind of useless, in some senses. But still, somewhat interesting. Kids will like it.<br /><br />--Rami Ungar, author of \\"The Quiet Game: Five Tales To Chill Your Bones\\"
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Good program for all ages.  It's nice to have a program we all like without all the profanity.  Must see.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Way too pricey, at $15 more than it sells for elsewhere, but my 10-year-old grandson who loves all things Lego and Minecraft, enjoyed it.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I personally thought this was a great movie. A lot of twist and very well done. This movie is worth a look and see. ENJOY!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very pleasant way to pass your downtime<br />Clean fun game for any age. Must try this app for continual fun any time of day!
B0040I09RM|4.0|I finished season 1 in a week and already onto season 2. It's very well acted and I appreciate the injection of humor since overall it's a very violent and bleak world. The writers of the show have convinced me to root for gun-running murderers ...
B00EVN2D3O|5.0|Well, they lied. There's no way to download the movies like they say. Great movie, but if you want a copy of your own, buy the DVD/BLU-Ray
B0081336FO|5.0|One of the best Sherlock Holmes versior so far, I totally recomended. You need to see it from the very beginning.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|VERY GOOD.  I HOPE THIS SHOW WILL CONTINUE  ALICE FLOORICK  IS GOOD.  I LIKE WILL.  AND KALINDA IS GREAT. CARY.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. It makes you think & is fun to work over after a time as you forget where everything is.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I love paracord and have just recently discovered all of the things you can make with it.  This book has some good instructions and many ideas for paracord  bracelets and other items.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved these books. I was completely consumed by the plot and the details. This has definitely got to be my favorite book series. It gave me a new perspective on the power a couple of people and how love can bring about change. Everything happened the way I wanted it to. I chose to read the entire series before part two of the movie came out and I was not disappointed. A must read.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I ordered this to amuse my grandchildren when they are restless or bored. They are better at this game than me.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Very entertaining movie. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I wasn't a huge fan of the ending, but it certainly didn't ruin the movie!
B00631VJIC|5.0|Awesome cd. Captures the essence of the earlier series. I will be playing this lots. Just got series 5 on DVD and can't wait to see what comes next.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|As usual, fast shipping with Prime and no problems with packaging. It's a pretty good season, among the best so far.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Just finishing it up and can't wait to start book two.  My favorite type of book to read is fiction based on historical moments... and trilogies.  So this book is perfect for me.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is a really different book.  I have read one other book by this author and must say I am impressed with the writing and the twisted characters.  I have friends that recommended this book and am passing on the advice..give it a read it is worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire and sometimes this is a real challenge to figure out which way to go. Great for keeping your mind sharp.
B000296P2G|1.0|It has not subtitles and for that reason it is not posible to enjoy the words... which are the best as well. On the web it is indicated with subtitles!!<br />Regards
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|very addictive! Hard to put down. Can be a challenge at times. I highly recommend this game for seek gamers.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|A pretty good release from Five Finger. It's a big soft for hardcore fans of the heavier subgenres of metal. But for people like me that enjoy heavy guitar and a mix of growling and clean vocals, it is right on target. And they remade LL Cool J's &#34;Mama Said Knock You Out&#34;. That alone is worth it.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Its been a long time but you will love the ne EWF the ballads, the groove the fire of this group is back and it is on my favorite list
B001KWP54S|5.0|Looking for something to listen to while spending some time on a commuter bus.....I decided to buy this favorite.<br />Who can not like the art coming from not one but two musical legends?
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. Really good quality stream. First time seeing it since watching it in the movies. It's on my watch list.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|Maybe the best season yet! It's difficult to say for sure.  One thing I can say with confidence, it's been a thrilling ride from the pilot to the series finale, one I'm sure to take again and again.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|what I was looking for. will tell my friends when searching for items to always always always check amazon first.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I am an adult who enjoys this app because it's relaxing. I'm ashamed to admit I've even spent some money on it. This week a video advertisement has started to pop up and interrupt the game. This has annoyed me more than once and I am considering dumping the game over it. I don't know what the ad is for because I refuse to watch it, but it makes you wait 5 seconds to skip it.
B00DYFCYSO|2.0|Its not what he has put forth in the pass don't take my word for it listen to how it sounds yourself
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Excellent book, heartwarming and fun to read. This book makes you believe you live in this precious little town and are friends with the characters.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|A great new twist on an old Star Trek TV show and they did a really good job.  I really enjoyed the movie, and amazingly my wife even liked it (and that is saying a lot).
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Another really god read! Always lots of humor and super characters. Sometimes have trouble with the British culture and humor, but so worth it.
B0000696ID|5.0|what I was looking for. will tell my friends when searching for items to always always always check amazon first.
B00376AWFM|5.0|Music On Vinyl's reissue of Audioslave's self titled album is one of their best! Sprawling across two discs, the album is given the masterful treatment and classics like 'I Am The Highway' sit beautifully in the groove. No background noise - clear and crisp. This is a keeper!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|If you love mahjong you'll love this app. It is the largest selection of games I've seen. You will not get bored.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Interesting and detailed scenes.  Not super challenging, but also not super easy.  Music is slightly annoying (at least to me, only because it's the same tune over and over)  But overall a fun game that will keep you busy for a while!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The Jack Reacher character is supposed to be 6'4&#34; and buff. Hardly a Tom Cruise type. I'm one of the many people I know who are tired of Cruise.
B00D0SA8I8|5.0|Uses maps from OpenStreetMap the wonderful free wiki world map. A not-for-profit project to map the world. If you see something wrong in the map data, head to OpenStreetMap.org to fix it! With this app, once you've got set up with a chunk OpenStreetMap data, you get great looking fluid vector maps and an impressive range of features, including routing and searching for particular POI types.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this case and bought it with my Kindle Fire HD. It doesn't add bulk and it looks very nice.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's great and fun easy and gets boating some times and I am not sure if I am not a kindle I am here son
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved that dog!  If only they could talk. But we can guess what they're thinking and how much they appreciate us.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Outstanding!  What is not to love about Maggie Smith.  Tom Courtenay steals the show and the music is wonderful.  Peace.
B004KKX814|5.0|Just what my son wanted.  Good price.  Doesn't come with a card like American beys but a good piece for an enthusiast.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|As sci-fi flicks go, this was plenty entertaining.  A few surprises.  No unnecessary romances, which was good.  Overall well worth watching.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is really fun if you like the hidden pictures game, but it is annoying.  I have activated some objects that don't  last the full time
B008SOS63S|5.0|WOW. TAKE IT FROM ME. BUY THIS CD. FANTASTIC.  I'M GONNA BUY ON VINYL IF I CAN FIND. JOE KICKS A##....
B005OK721G|3.0|I love Zoe from Avatar; but, Pulleezee, give her some better stuff.<br />This cuda been a great movie; but, I had to give up half way thru.<br /><br />Her way of getting into jail with a minimum of pat down was spot on; But,<br />her hit in the jail was unbelieveable because all grills and light fixtures<br />are secured with security type screws.  No way she could waltz thru the<br />air conditioner ducts.  A little research?  Hmmmm...<br /><br />A comparison was made to Mission Impossible series---NOT THE MOVIE!<br />Their scenarios were usually so spot on that the Russkies and E. Germans<br />were paranoid.<br /><br />Zoe is beautiful and talented.  Give her better material!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Scribblenauts Remix is a game about your imagination! Type anything and it will come to life. Personally, I like to play with the 'Free Time' mode as I like to call it, but you can play levels as well. Also, this game is a great time waster and brings out laughs from the crankiest of people.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So good...a quick read. I loved these characters.  I am looking forward to the movie now. I recommend this to everyone.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Great book...up to date with terrorists and Somolia pirate activity...interesting coverage of the capabily and use of drones...also does a good job of describing special ops procedures and techniques.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS THE MOST  AWESOME GAME OF ALL TIME NO DRAGONS THOUGH BUT STILL COOL STUFF IN HISTORY OF ALL TIME
B000001ESN|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST OF THEIR RELEASES, AND THE SEXY GAL ON THE COVER,, JUST ADDS TO THE MUSIC.  BUY IT.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|and getting better all the time.  I always look forward to any movie Ben makes because I know he'll place plenty of thought and guidance of entertainment in how he shoots his movie....Argo is such a movie and not one to miss!
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|The movie was great, and the quality was even better than I expected.  You can't go wrong with Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton.
B009WUBERW|5.0|TV doesn't show many good shows, too much unreality in reality shows.  I'd much rather rent great movies like this for my viewing time
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am writing 20 words to fulfill the review requirements.  I am down to only a few more words.  End
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Love it.  It keeps getting better an better.  I can wait to watch the episodes.  Issue me want to watch network TV again.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112. RUSH. WHAT CAN YOU SAY BUT, A CLASSIC.OUTSTANDING,POWERFUL,SPECTACULAR ALBUM. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE THEIR BEST. A MUST HAVE, IF YOU ONLY BUY ONE RUSH ALBUM, THIS IS IT.ENJOY.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed the light heartedness and quick wit portrayed by the characters in this book.  It was a quick and easy read.
B005LAII4E|5.0|Love the movie and we have been enjoying getting the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital copy versions to expand our options of where we can watch the movies.  Came on time and no packaging issues.
B00DUIBZSK|1.0|wont download so I was ripped off thanks Amazon :(  Don't waste your time and money. I have been satisfied with previous song purchases why wont this one download?

0988262592|4.0|Although \\"The Phoenix Project\\" is aimed for CIOs, I don't recommend CIOs reading it.  The book is well-written, but that's exactly the problem: it's too close to our reality (although one might say the reality is even gloomier).  I'm certain that after reading just about any page a CIO will start reiterating through similar situations from his own practice.  Frustration, anger and high blood pressure are guaranteed.  Do you need it, my unfortunate colleagues?  Don't you have enough at work?  Any one of us could write a similar book...<br /><br />PS. I spent my first hour with \\"The Phoenix Project\\", then closed it and promised to myself not to open it again.  I kept this promise for the whole day...  Well, almost...  Now I'm half way through.  My mood has changed correspondingly.  My wife is not happy.  Beware.<br /><br />Eugene Nizker, CIO

B004IFYMWK|1.0|This is one of those leftist fantasy movies &#34; the world as it should be but isnt&#34;........Its a make believe movie about pre Iraq War intelligence that purports to prove Saddam Hussein had no desire to develop nuclear weapons. Good old liberal CNN had to report in 2008 that the US military secretly shipped 500 Tons of yellow cake uranium from Iraq to Canada. (How can that be Joe Wilson?  Tell us wont you?) This alone pretty much debunks the whole premise of the movie. This movie is full of similar leftist mythology.......pure belly button gazing for lefty metrosexuals....
0316228583|2.0|Full disclosure: I seem to be the only human who detests the entire Harry Potter franchise, and I am no Rowling fan.  So why would I read a 500-page book penned by her?  Curiosity.  I wondered what this billionaire, mega-successful author had to say to and about adults in the real world, after spending so many years in the happy fantasyland of kiddie lit.  Well, she has a lot to say, and all of it is depressing.  A Casual Vacancy could be subtitled Dreadful People Behaving Badly in a Picturesque Town.  It's Britain under a microscope, analyzed by a dispeptic depressive.  It's misanthropy and despair.  The book is bleak.<br /><br />British literature has a long tradition of small-town sagas, where class divisions and petty resentments create drama amidst timbered heritage buildings, manor houses, and cobbled streets.  It's the Biscuit-Box version of rural and small-town England.  Throw in a couple of cops and a dead body, or a clammy vicar with a secret past, and you have a BBC drama.  Rowling has used this familiar template -- turned it on its head -- to display the raw ugliness of real life in modern Britain.  Blatant and enduring racism, class snobberies, the shortcomings of social services and the failure of the welfare state, the pettiness of politics, the overwhelming hypocrisy of humans across all classes -- it's all there in the little town of Pagford.  It's not for nothing that Rowling has the addict Terri keeping her kit for shooting up in a biscuit tin sporting a scene from Merrie Olde England (a rather heavy-handed writer's trick for such an experienced author).<br /><br />For all its wordiness, this is a quick read.  I found myself skimming some of the harsher passages (did we have to hear so much from Simon?), and regretting that I'd read the more sordid bits (pure pulp fiction, that).  But I did feel compelled to finish, and I will tell you why.  The simmering nastiness that runs through this book was very familiar to me.  It reminded me of my own small community, all the way down to the smug, self-appointed rulers, the hissing gossip, and (sadly) the \\"community\\" page on the Internet.  Alas.<br /><br />Rowling has some annoying writer's quirks, including the three-dot trail off...and the too-frequent, parenthetical aside written in the pluperfect.  For that alone I'm inclined to give this just one star.  But she is an astute observer of human behavior (if a stink-eyed one), so A Casual Vacancy gets moved up to \\"it's okay.\\"  Not awful, not great, but certainly depressing.l community, all the way down to the smug, self-appointed rulers, the hissing gossip, and (sadly) the \\"community\\" page on the Internet.

B00F35BV64|2.0|If you're a newer fan of Star Trek, you probably loved this movie.<br /><br />Honestly, I found it a little disappointing, so much recycled from 1982's \\"the Wrath of Khan\\" Star Trek 2.  It was hard for me to sink my teeth into any part of the story.  We're off to a mysterious Klingon planet for no reason; there's a mysterious evil starfleet admiral with his own monster ship; for me the best part of the entire film was the hyperdrive chase between the 2 ships (hey, something original!)<br /><br />The last 30 minutes of the movie seem unnecessarily long and pointless.  The film seems to hint at some vast, mysterious conspiracy without ever explaining anything sensible.  There are MAJOR improbable points at every turn:  an admiral's daughter forges her name and sneaks onto a starship, really?  And, apparently, the best way to align your warp core is to send your captain to KICK the WARP CORE until it comes online.. any high school physics professor could tell you that this would likely incinerate the person in the process.<br /><br />For the most part, I agree with the \\"Honest Trailer\\" review here:<br />[...]<br /><br />I mean, if you're going to remake \\"the Wrath of Khan\\", then why not just do that?  It was a good story the first time around.  Instead this story really goes nowhere and is mostly of the \\"vast evil conspiracy\\" variety without any real rationale.<br /><br />If you like NOT THINKING MUCH and watching Chris Pine fighting and starships that look like egg beaters flying around and running into planets, this is the movie FOR YOU.

B00E1LT41K|1.0|Having studied the Wars of the Roses at University I was interested this show. On some superficial level, there is a hint of a good story in this series though I cannot comment upon Philipa Gregory's skill as a writer, having never read her works. There were also some interesting characters who one could almost grow to care for and have their moments, and the whole thing looks good.<br />It might even have been passable as an average sword and sorcery style fantasy series but it is actually supposed to be `historical', which may be the gravest error of all, alongside the reliance on sex to `spice' things up, and content which could be an insult to the intelligence as well as the past.<br /><br />King Edward IV seemed to spend much of his time strutting about like some self-absorbed celebrity expecting to run the country by virtue of everyone fawning over his wonderfulness, or thought his political rivals ought to thank him for usurping the throne and killing their family members.<br />Though of course (or at least so we are told) 'Lancaster bought nothing but war' but York bought peace'. Really? So why did Edward have to go and fight in almost every episode up to the sixth? Strange definition of 'peace'- especially considering that the Yorkists also pretty much started the Wars of the Roses in the first place....<br /><br />The character's knowledge of events is even more questionable, Like Clarence who alleges that Margaret of Anjou killed his father- apparently having read Shakespeare's play which alleged she did this 150 years after the event, but not aware of the reality that she was actually in Scotland at the time.<br />The over-simplification of the conflict and political realities of the period is coupled with characters who whilst they seemed very adept at spouting Yorkist propaganda, yet appeared ignorant of historical facts and events they are meant to have taken part in.<br />Thus it was claimed that the war was started to `get rid of Henry', when in fact this was not the aim of the Yorkists at all initially, and that for the first five years of the conflict (1455-60) their avowed intention was mainly to bring about political reform- repeatedly attesting their loyalty to King Henry all while.<br />Given that Warwick played a major role in the events of this period he ought to have known this, but seems to suffer from a form of selective amnesia that afflicts several of the characters.<br /><br />Then there was the scene in which the Lancastrians at Tewkesbury, despite having a number of seasoned warriors in their ranks, sought  strategic advice from a whining teenage girl with no military experience.  Little Anne Neville then displays her rank stupidity by riding off into the Middle of of aftermath of a Battle following a tantrum. That's not good history. Its not even good drama, or good characterization- its just plain ridiculous. Yet its far from the only thing that is.<br />Given that for a drama that is supposed to span some 21 years, most of the characters do not seem to age, and still look twenty after decades. These characters either seemed to have an uncanny knack for anticipating the course of events, telling each other how they would pan out, or remarking 'that's treasonable'.<br />Yeah, they already know that- but of course the audience have to be reminded, apparently. OK so some might not be aware, but the way its done is as bad as having British characters in a Regency Drama constantly having to refer the Navy the British Royal Navy, every time they mention it- in case the makers think the audience might forget which 'navy' they are talking about.<br /><br />Seriously, this is not a Shakespeare play, where its sort of more acceptable to have a Chorus character to come in and to remind us of what's going on, or long monologues.<br />Its not even a patch on Shakespeare, whose depiction of events and figures of this period was far more complicated and nuanced.<br /><br />Add to this that many of the depictions of figures and events seem to owe more to Yorkist propaganda or political correctness than anything else. If this series was really based on a desire to rehabilitate vilified women, or present a pro-woman perspecive opposed to male centered propaganda, why does it vilify some women, specifically Lancastrian women?<br />Hence Margaret of Anjou, whom this series seems to carry on the centuries old tradition of  presenting her as near enough the devil incarnate.<br />There's no evidence for instance that Anne Neville was treated cruelly by her, and of course she is condemned as a `tyrant'. Even as a reflection of the time, there seems to be something grossly hypocritical about men who had few moral qualms about killing or executing their own cousins and even siblings whining about a woman having acted as ruthlessly as they did  towards her political opponents, and daring to fight them to defend or reclaim her son's inheritance.<br /><br />Yet whine and object the Yorkists do- all the more ironic considering how Edward became the first King since the Norman Conquest to kill his own brother. Even this seems sanitized, as we are meant to somehow think poor Clarence somehow deserved it- when he was never actually convicted for treason at all, and so Edward's actions constituted little more than judicial murder.<br />Yet it seems to be the case that, more often than not, that the less than admirable deeds of the Yorkists are frequently glossed over,  sanitized or they, claim, are in the greater 'good'. Of course, they're supposed to be the 'goodies', and only behave nastily when someone else's actions compel them to,<br /><br />Hence, perhaps there is no mention of 35 or so Lancastrian knights or nobles who were killed or executed after the battle of Tewkesbury, when those who had fled to the Abbey for Sanctuary were lured out either with false promises of mercy, or a sacrilegious act of defilement, in which Edward and his men sough to kill them in the Abbey itself. What is known, is that so much blood was spilled that the Abbey had to be reconsecrated.<br />All we see of this is mention of one man being dragged out of 'a church' and beheaded. If this does not count as sanitizing an act of terror, what does?<br />Not that major battles are often seen. The  that does feature prominently is Bosworth- for some odd reason fought in a wood.<br /><br />On another issue. Its apparently  acceptable to place curses on people and seek assistance from obscure water goddesses when difficulties arise. Praying and talking of God's will, however, apparently makes a person a ranting fantastic, and fighting for one's rights a tyrant- if they happen to support Lancaster.<br />It is perhaps notable, as another reviewer pointed out that the witches, Elizabeth and her mother and daughters are the `tragic heroines' of the series, whose sometimes homicidal vindictiveness almost seems to be excused.<br />Conversely, apparently in keeping with the BBC's tradition of Christian bashing the devout Margaret Beaufort is presented an unscrupulous Machiavellian villain willing to go to literally any lengths to achieve her ends, with nobody considering that her belief in God's will, and divine intervention of human affairs might have been quite normal in the 1400s.<br /><br />Of course there's no evidence that Elizabeth ever practiced witchcraft, but who wants to let the facts get in the way of a good story when there's plenty of rumour, speculation or outright falsehood to colour the narrative? The greatest of all such speculation has to be that Margaret Beaufort, in league with Lord Stanley was behind the deaths of the Princes in the Tower. Not that there is any serious historical evidence for this theory, or that it is considered credible by the majority of historians. But what does that matter?<br />Any theory is preferable to implying that their dear Uncle Richard may have been responsible, which would upset the Richard III society after all.<br /><br />No, apparently a character who helped murder a helpless elderly man is his bed could absolutely never have murdered his helpless innocent nephews. Even his own besotted niece was convinced he could not have done it, seeming to conveniently forget how he had her half-brother and Uncle executed when acting as his apologist. Then again, she was sleeping with him- but only to discredit Henry Tudor (the greater good again) and this doesn't  seem to reflect badly on Richard or damage his reputation.<br /><br />Yet I fear that in the legacy of other dire pseudo-historical dramatic offerings of questionable morals, this will influence's people perceptions of the Wars of the Roses for years to come.<br />Anyone interested in gaining a genuine understanding of this period would be much better off seeking a good non-fiction book, or one of the better novelists who actually knows what objectivity is.hat is known, is that so much blood was spilled that the Abbey had to be reconsecrated.<br />All we see of this is mention of one man being dragged out of 'a church' and beheaded.

B0012HCASA|4.0|I liked the Terminator movies. They were fun and had some great CGI for their time.<br /><br />I avoided watching the SCCs because I felt they would be a crappy spinoff. When searching for Prime material to watch in the SciFi area, I skipped over this series many times. I finally decided to give it a chance based upon a recommendation from my sister and a lady friend. Two women that rarely watch SciFi stuff giving this show a good recommendation????<br /><br />The lead actress, Lena Headey, goes a fantastic job. I did not feel any actress would be able to replace Linda Hamilton in this role but I was wrong. Headey reprises the role well in both attitude and appearance. She is a woman determined to see her son survive and nothing will get in her way.<br /><br />The supporting actors also do very well. River Tam from Firefly does a great job playing the protector Terminator named Cameron. Brian Austin Green and Thomas Dekker are well suited for their roles.<br /><br />Like Firefly, I would love to see this series given new life.<br /><br />The series had a solid storyline and is worth the watch even if it only lasts two seasons. A very solid 4 stars.

Only this single point enables reader to rethink relationships with herself and others peoples (and again for both types of persons)<br />2) The book is relatively short and very concise.

B00304LF0W|5.0|My upbringing led me to fear demons above all else. While I no longer buy into the fear based dogma of my childhood, I find myself drawn to movies with themes of demons, ghosts, or other supernatural phenomena.  I detest contrite characters/scripts in movies, as well as found-footage films that nauseate me when the credits roll (i.e., Blair Witch).<br /><br />With all that in mind, I found Paranormal Activity fell right up my alley. This is the kind of film that stayed on my mind after watching, and the genuineness of the characters (there really are only two characters for most of this movie) plus the build-in of creep factor and imagining the possibilities of this happening in my bedroom, along with the lack of cheesy chase/scream scenes made this movie for me.  Sound was key.  If you watch this at a regular or lower volume, you will not have as good an experience.  This movie is best watched in the dark, with headphones, so you can get the full effect...it's almost like you're there in the room with Katie and Micah.  Sounds are what made this movie particularly fear-inducing for me.<br /><br />I also think that seen in the context of Paranormal 2 and then 3 (I didn't love 4 as much), the whole package ties it together in ways that answer questions which might nag at the viewer. However, I still think the film stands on its own without the others to make it complete.<br /><br />Finally, because this movie was made of \\"found-footage,\\" (though again not the shaky, dizzying kind) it made it seem much more real and the possibility that this could happen in my bedroom made it all the more frightening.<br /><br />If you're into fast moving plots and need a continuous jolt of scare throughout a film, this might not be your thing.  I have known people who either love it or hate it, so I hope the above helps you determine which side of the fence you might be on.

Jo Nesbo is a Norwegian writer known for his fictional character Harry Hole. America has started to pay attention to \\"the classic loose canon\\" in the police force. One of America's most famous writers can't hide his admiration for the Norwegian author and his famous character: \\"Jo Nesbo is my new favorite thriller writer and Harry Hole is my new hero.\\" - Michael Connelly. \\"The Snowman\\" was also a bestseller in New York Times. \\"Fiendishly complex and terrifically entertaining\\" - The New York Times Book Review. As you can see, Jo Nesbo's seventh crime novel has gotten good reviews from the readers. But what makes it so good?<br /><br />Jo Nebo has done it again, 512 pages with absolutely perfection. If you need something to read before you go to bed, this is the right book. But I'm warning you, it's hard to put it away. If you first get to know inspector Harry Hole, it's difficult to stop meeting him, and follow his cases to the very end. Betrayal and infidelity is in centrum in this book. Every year at the first snowfall, women get murdered and a snowman is always at the scene of the crime. Harry Hole is on the case, and chasing a serial killer. Women get's kidnapped and their scarfs are in a strange way around the snowman's neck. No one knows where the snowman is coming from.<br />\\"The Snowman\\" is a book for you if you're over 15 years. It's a superb thriller, spine-chilling and is strung together with great care. This is a highly readable book and Jo Nesbo writes very well in many ways. If you read Jo Nesbo's novels, (especially The Snowman) you would get to know how the environment in Norway are, how the police works and follow the inspectors in their job to catch serial killers and difficult cases. \\"The Snowman\\" won the best novel in Norway in 2007 and was awarded The Norwegian Booksellers' Prize the same year.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo is not afraid of writing about social issues of life and the book is written in a very intelligent way.  His novel is very descriptive and it gives you small details to pay attention to. It's like a brainteaser. Even if it is a Norwegian book, Americans have said it's perfectly translated by Don Bartlett. That means it's very readable, even in English. There is a lot of great recommendable foreign literature, that is translated to hundred of other languages. You never stop being surprised by Jo Nesbo's novels, and it's remarkable how many twists and turns there is before the suspect is captured.<br />\\"The Snowman\\" is known world wide for one of the greatest crime novels. It was decided last year that Martin Scorsese is going to direct a movie based on \\"The Snowman\\" and it would be released in 2014. For those who have read the book, can't wait to see the movie. For those who haven't read the book, really have to do it. It's the best book I've ever read, and it's my favorite Jo Nesbo novel of ten. It's nerve wrecking, extremely intelligent and a masterpiece of a novel. For only 11,38 Dollars you can get it. As I said earlier, this novel has gotten the best reviews from the biggest newspapers in the world. You should definitely buy this book! \\"The Snowman\\" is a superb thriller with an absolutely brilliant plot. I quote the USA Today: \\"If you don't know Nesbo, it's time to get with it\\" I could not agree more.d was awarded The Norwegian Booksellers' Prize the same year.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo is not afraid of writing about social issues of life and the book is written in a very intelligent way.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I seriously love this app! it is awesome an so easy and fun. I love how easy it is to get hearts an level up
B00004TDTO|5.0|I give jaws a 5 star rating due to the fact that it has so many bonus features to choose from and it's a classic film that has stood the test of time.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Totally worth watching. Everyone in my household (varying ages) really enjoyed it. Check it out. You will not be disappointed.
B0033H7VI6|3.0|love the design of the knife and weight is about right for the intent for the knifes use. but the quality control of the company running these knives is very poor one side of the knife has drop point lines and the other side of the knife has line lay out for a tanto design . i will keep and do what i can with it and make a chopper out of it dont not want to wast my time with the company of this type of quality control.
B000002ADT|4.0|It is Miles Davis is there really anything more to say. I would suggest listening to the samples before purchasing to make sure it has the classics you are looking for.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Let me first say that this movie wasn't my 1st pick, but I caved into my family's persuasions and I'm so glad I did.  This movie gave me the \\"Edge of your seat\\" experience from the first minutes of the movie all the way to the end.  The creators put a more realistic spin on the \\"hero\\" role and that is what I enjoyed.  They didn't make him this larger than life glamourous character that always seems to know exactly what to do.  Without spoiling the movie I will just leave it at that.  It is definitely worth the money and the time.  It is a heart warming, hopeful, brutal, suspenseful, shocking portrayal of humanity and inhumanity.  Don't miss it!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|It is hard to load film.  I forget the steps to go through to accomplish the task.  Pictures turn out pretty good.  I did both slides and colored film.  I would buy it again.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was an engaging story that allowed me to connect with the characters.  Neil Gaiman wrote it so of course there were parts I didn't fully understand. That's part of his appeal. He leaves me wondering. He seemed to be exploring the good--and bad--that lies within. And the innocence with which we're all born. Maybe it's that innocence that makes us all inherently worthy. We are here because we were summoned and we do our best to play the hand we're dealt. Hopefully, as we play that hand, we gain wisdom that allows us to deal a better future for those who follow.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This is a great season. Not as good as season one and two but still better then almost everything else on the air.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Wish there were more programs like this on TV.  Love the plot development, the setting---it feels so real, and the actors.  I will miss the series terribly when it is finished.  I am a bit hesitate to watch the US version by FOX
B009AVC922|5.0|The first time I watched this was in college and I thought it was the most awesome anime I had ever seen mainly because of some of the shock value. The story line and the acting was not too bad like some of the other DVDs that are in this series so I added it to my collection.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Everybody's body is different, no matter what diet plan you're on. To me, thats the most frustrating thing. It's always been harder for me to lose weight.  So far, I'm on week 3 and lost 7 pounds. It was a very slow start but, plateaus do end and your body does break down fat eventually. The key is remaining consistent. It was an easy enough diet plan for me to make it a lifestyle, fortunately.  It allows you to eat out a lot and it require a rather inexpensive selection of foods to buy. Easy read. Didn't need to read the entire book or run 5 miles a day. Definitely worth the buy!
B00F35BV64|2.0|Ho Hum. Disappointed. Special effects without a decent plot is only special effects and they simply don't impress anymore. Need a real plot and how about some science fiction?? Minimal plot and no science fiction and amazing how in the future there is so much \\"kick and punch\\". If you a Star Trek fan, guess you going to watch it but otherwise, skip this one. Try Blade Runner. Date movie? I guess. Viewing with spouse? Amazingly does have a \\"foul\\" word here and there but no idea why except to get rating?? No need for the few foul words. I wasted my time on this one.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|This would be a fun game but it freezes constantly or will close itself down. Hopefully bugs can be worked out.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the addition of the extra melodies and noises you can add. I have changed mine around a bit. and found one I really like. Great to help me sleep naturally.
B004LDLI0S|5.0|Hate them both or Love them both. What's important is the realization that they came preaching the same message and suffered the same fate.
B0051OZ564|3.0|This movie has some questionable acting and there are a few gaps in why things were happening which I did not get until after watching it over and over a few times (maybe I'm slow). But it doesn't drop to the bottom of my list of things to watch maybe because of the soundtrack which I also own. The fighting is believable, the graphics are good, some of the fighting chorography is repeated but I only caught that because I watch it a lot. I wouldn't suggest that my friends watch it because I wouldn't say &#34;THAT MOVIE WAS AWESOME&#34; but I would put it on. I don't know if this review was helpful to you.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Feedback Havent used it yet...Christmas Present.  Plan to use it with the new ATV we will buy for Christmas...Thanks DF
B0004Z33G4|5.0|dvds are all in very good condition but the case was cracked with a piece missing.  It is ok but it not mention in the description of course it could have been broken in transport since it came through the post office.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but since I had read the book, I was a little disappointed that many details were left out. I would watch it again, so it was obviously pretty good.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Not only does he sing beautifully...& in different languages...equally well--------he has great instrumental talents!!  His talents just blow me away.  All the songs on this disc are real &#34;keepers&#34;....I am so in love with Voce Existe Em Mim!!  WOW!!....& I am in my upper 60's......but my mind & heart are quite young.  The years I have lived have taught me to take pride in & value wonderfully talented people....like this incredible young man.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|One of the best and sometimes underrated bands to come out of the 80's. If you liked/like the band you will like John's account of how it all happened and the fun and games that ensued. His account seems very honest and is a good read.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|This was a weird movie.<br /><br />movie contained weird delusional effects which caused confusion.<br /><br />The movie just had the crazy math guy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wife plays it everyday...Nice little app for free...Did what it said it would...Thanks ... Will use it on the new tablet we plan to buy for Christmas...Df
B000VUCIZO|3.0|The summation of the first half of this book is, &#34;My dad says being totally honest and being an engineer are the best.&#34; The next half gets interesting and covers a lot of the unknown aspects of the life of Woz. While not going super nitty gritty into the technical details Woz does describe his inspirations for building the first real PC, how he created the color interface, and dives into several of his big &#34;joke&#34; inspired shenanigans.<br /><br />Pretty decent read but the first half of the book is very much repetitive preaching of being honest and about his fathers virtues that were passed on.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|Peter Collier pens another superior creative story. Kids love snow and most of them love animals. Combining the two elements was genius. Not to mention, the illustrations in this story were eye popping. This gave my daughter a lot to talk about. I would recommend this and many other Peter Collier stories for kids 3-10. These books are a hit!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This young man has a talent to be savored & appreciated.  I listen to him @  home & in my car.  I do not have to understand the language to love & appreciate what is being vocally expressed!  So many of the songs so touch my heart!
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Not sure why the PG rating except for some<br />violence. It is funny though. My grandkids<br />laughed and talked about it later.
B008469DGY|3.0|The game is fun but it only allows you to tee off.  You can't complete<br />The hole by putting. Holes in one are all that counts.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Got the Kindle Fire....Again...we are not a computer savy family...Will get our son to show us how when he comes home on leave.  Df
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Very addictive game and very fun trying to beat my friends.  Best free game I've downloaded so far.  A great way to spend two minutes, but don't know what yo do with the coins I've earned.  I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes fast paced games.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I would not recommend this. The characters were empty. I forced myself to finish this. Blah. This was a disappointment.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I don't even know where to begin. The tears started falling around chapter 11 and didn't stop until the very end. I'm still fighting back tears just thinking about the story. Jojo Moyes is a brilliant writer, I don't even know what to say to give this book the justice it deserves. This book is heart wrenching, it's funny and sarcastic, its a telling of love and loss.<br /><br />While reading Me Before You, I became Louisa, and I felt everything that happened. There are very few books that can make me openly sob for the characters, and I did more than that with this book. I'm completely gutted, but at the same time, I am happy that each character was the way they were. 100 % pure brilliance!! This book is going straight to my favorites shelf and I recommend this book to everybody!!!
B00BCZUAE8|3.0|What can I say. Honestly kind of a snooze fest here. I was able to get this album for under 5 dollars. Main reason I got it. The beats sound mostly the same and the subject matter is all the same. Nothing too exciting. Suit and Tie is the best song on here. Doesn't have a upbeat vibe here.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|These newer Star Trek movies are just Awesome.The story,the character's,the CGI,everything had me riveted & I'm not even into these types of movies.The charscter&#34;Kahn&#34;is absolutely Bad A$$.You go Spock!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Another fantastic game by Bart.  This and Factory Balls are both excellent logic/thinking games.  Seems simple at first but once you get to Level 20+ it gets very hard.  Enjoy this one &amp;  grab it while you can...Looks can be deceiving but I've learned a long time ago graphics and realism aren't the only things that make a great game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator and it works, which is what counts.  It has large &quot;buttons,&quot; so that eliminates errors from fat-fingering.  My toddler loves to play with it, and it has no ads or ad icons, so he can do no accidental harm touching anything he sees on the screen.  It does everything I need it to and it's free.  Pretty much perfect.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Maybe not the best sound quality, but they stay on my head when I run and they are comfortable in my ears. adjustable so they fit over or under hats too.
B00B19H2KU|4.0|This movie was as good as I expected.  I believe it was directed by Guillermo Del Toro, so that would explain a lot. Two shaking thumbs up!
B0026KX5PO|4.0|Somewhat different from the book but the changes make sense together combined withgood acting and believable situations make this a good movie.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The Alfa AWUS036NHR High Gain wireless ant booster works amazing well.  I would recommended this product to any and all people who have a need to increase their access to a wireless signal.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I loved all the Alien movies and having them all in 1 collection and in Blu-Ray is a great addition to my collection. I've watched all these movies more times than I can remember and seeing them in Blu-Ray is watching them for the 1st time. Excellent collection to add to yours
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fascinating characters from Germany, Great Beitain, Russia and the US,  interwoven with great insights into a period of history too often ignored.<br />So many parallels to our own times.
B000127LW2|5.0|My wife and I have enjoyed this series but were missing this in our collection, not any more, now it is complete!
B004EWFV9K|5.0|In this, the last of the Kurt Wallendar series, Kurt never gives up in his determination to find the guilty. As usual, he uses means that might, as usually do, cause him some trouble. He finally get that dog he has wanted and moves to the country. It's not as wonderful as he had hoped, but it's a change he has needed. I've been addicted to and loved all of Mankel's Kurt Wallendar's tales. Do start with the first one of the series, which I think is Faceless Killers. You'll be hooked by the character of Kurt; his dogged determination, his sense of justice, and the lengths he'll go to deliver justice. I will miss him!
B00DURILJ2|3.0|dislike, would be for someone who stuck in front of screen. scenery okay, characters okay, but many parts are to drawn out.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|I laugh and I cry.  This is really so well done and should be on everyone's must see list. I never get tired of seeing it over and over again.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Book 2 of the series lives up to it's predecessor. This book continues the story of Kovthe a wizard of great power. Excellent compelling story, I can't recommend this series enough!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled is a wonderful story teller! Layers of characters with intertwining tales. Extremely irresistible and enjoyable with an insight into life in Kabul.
B001TH16DI|5.0|These classic movies are even better on Bluray. I have always been a Star Trek fan and this is a great addition to my collection!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started but the game is pretty good so far. Will have to keep playing to see how it really is.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love this series. Live the dialogues. Love the characters. For the most part, it is clean. Suspenseful. Love the ongoing story in each episode.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|This is another great hit with in the Wimpy Kid series. Pure wholesome family entertainment that many families can relate to!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|What a great book, if you love the fantasy genre and your looking for something new and extremely well written grab this book. I read it in 3 days, every engrossing, excellent characters and a great story. I can't recommend this book enough!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I've played &#34;100 Floors,&#34; and it was enjoyable, but I gave up after wading through about half the floors and getting hopelessly stuck. But I really enjoyed &#34;You Must Escape.&#34; There are only ten rooms, and the puzzles that have to be solved are challenging, but not absurdly so. (If you do get stuck, as a last resort, there are walkthroughs online.)<br /><br />For a combination of length and difficulty, &#34;You Must Escape&#34; is a great puzzle app for killing a couple of hours. Addictive? Yes, absolutely, but it's fun and it's good exercise for your mind.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie the first time we say it, now it is a permanent addition to our collection.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|This book is so well written and very unusual as its written from the innocent view point of a 5 year old. Even so, we get the complete picture of the evil that surrounded him and his Mother and of her strength during the very difficult time they shared. The incredaibly strong bond between Mother and son is awe-inspiring and beautiful.<br />Awesome book, will  read anything this author writes.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like it. I have only have 2 complaints. One: after you use it for a while, you go to remove it from the TV and it's HOT. It gets really warm after just about 20min of use. Two: it only has a few programs that you can use it with, so you can't go to FB and stream a video from there, you have to use one of the programs that it's designed to use it with. BUT it really works well. I had no issues with it streaming to my TV.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Just finished the four book set. Literally could not put it down. I grew up with tv westerns and cop shows where the good guy always won by the end of the show. By half way thru the second book the good guys were dying. This is a story of people's eternal struggle for wealth and power and the extremes they will go to to obtain them. Set in an era of knights and castles and dragons the author shows all the extremes of good and bad of black and white and gray. The characters become real people that you will develop a relationship with as you turn each page. Some you will love,some you will hate and some you will love and hate. Great, great read.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It's designed to sharpen knives (obviously) and it does an amazing job! I keep this in the drawer right next to all my knives, it's so fast and easy to use. Love this product!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I liked this game. I makes you think while having fun. It offers me a good challenge while waiting somewhere.
0061743526|5.0|I had seen only bits and pieces of the movies, but had never read the book.  I couldn't put it down!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed, cried, pondered my existence, remembered falling in love for the first time, and fell in love with the characters Green created.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|When you change the font size it messes with the text and some times the big fonts have lines missing. You have to go to a smaller font to read the end of the page. When you use bigger fonts, the space the text occupies gets smaller and changes the layout.
B00371QQ0M|4.0|This is a great classic movie that was highly exposed when it hit the cinemas back in 1984, but unfortunately has been poorly supported on home medias ever since. However this version is very nicely restored to HD in cinemascope format (former DVD versions were pale 4:3 versions, not really worth watching). It's a real pleasure to watch and hear this version.<br />European subtitles are missing on this Blu-Ray; it's still a rare but worthy movie after all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was brilliant but by the end I was so disgusted by both characters, it made the book less enjoyable.  But for the most part, I would recommend it.  It's just very dark.
B00E97AZZK|4.0|Great Movie! Kept you guessing until the end! Great acting and plot! This movie is timeless and will become a true classic!
B00BMCAM6M|3.0|I like it but have not used it much it seems to need something more to load it . I have to load it two are more times
B00915G6MG|5.0|Another great season for NCIS! Love having the DVDs to Watch them over and over.  Can't wait for season 11.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I feel like a lawsuit is in order for false advertising since the box clearly states \\"Send video or anything on the web to your TV from your smartphone, tablet or laptop\\".  Googles latest forced update breaks all that... Which is the ONLY reason I bought it.  Google white listed a very small set of apps to work with it.  It's trash to me now.  Boo Google. Epic fail. I want my money back.<br /><br />[...]
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I like the way the author depicted anger we may want to inflict because we have a stopping point. It was good to see the point driven home that our perceptions are not always reality.<br /><br />Susan Schoenbeck
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is one of the best books I have ever read!!<br />In the beginning, I got confused and decided to watch the movie. After the movie, I came back to the book because I was able to understand the intro. This book has about 3 chapters not presented in the movie. It would be useful to compare the two. I plan on going ahead on the sequel. Can't wait for the second movie= to come out!
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Wanted to re-watch season two before season three started.  I knew I'd watch again over time so got the DVDs.
B0050Q3UEM|1.0|hard to load hard to play and I just seem to have trouble with it at every turn hope to see it in proved.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so awesome and also to make it better I've been added to Alpha0.7.0 yeah I have YouTube vids on how to play on realms for free but I'm currently not allowed to make them so I'm so sorry but other than that minecraft is so awesome guys or gals realms will be done soon and that's pretty much all I can tell you for right now
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very easy to use. I like having it on my Kindle. So easy to set and change.  Lots of options with it.
1476734941|4.0|I read the entire book found it interesting now trying to fit this &#34;fast diet&#34; into my lifestyle. I plan on giving this diet a try, but have not done it yet.
1582701709|5.0|I read this book when it was first published in 2006.I had read many of the contributors previously both past and present so I was able to recognize much of the wisdom that was expressed. It is a truly inspirational book and the 'Secret Summaries' at the end of each chapter cause you to look back and see what you have just absorbed. 'The Secret' is indeed  thousands of years old wisdom that is tapped into and explained simply. Practice it and you too could be the top of your game just as the contributors were and Rhonda Byrne still is being a New York Times best seller many times over. Read, absorb and practice 'the Secret'.[[ASIN:B00EOAKQF6 Walk the Pathway to Spirituality.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|By now the author has managed to make me love the characters. The internal and external struggles they face drive me crazy. The story is so interesting that I hate putting it down.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This is very good with as well as the definition it comes with a translation of a alternative language although considering all of this needs a little more description for the minds of the less advantaged
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book was awesome.  A real page turner.  Nicholas Sparks has a way of making you feel you are right there with the characters.  I would recommend this book to friends.  Have never been disappointed when reading a Nicholas Sparks book.
0375869026|4.0|I purchased this book for my two daughters they both enjoyed reading it. The book was delivered on time good value for the money.
B000068R1X|3.0|I just bought this to complete my collection, Ozzy's best work is STILL with Black Sabbath, i think its time Ozzy hanged it up
B001NLL93W|5.0|The events that unfolded made me happy. I like the direction taken by the author to progress the series. I will continue to the next book.
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|i haven't seen it yet. must be a good film. dvd arrived in a brand new condition. however i didn't like the packaging of the dvd. that's why i'm giving 4 stars for this product.  it looked like cheap made chinese copy. so i just discarded the dvd case and kept the dvd in my dvd collection bag.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|very fun. Great graphics. Very cool. Great for ages 10+. The game as little to no bugs in it. And it never glitch out
B0000256VK|5.0|Positively, irrefutably, unequivocally, inescapably, undeniably - one of the pinnacle and definitive voices and most enrapturing, and emotionally enveloping and compelling sounding bands of especially and particularly The 80’s, into the 90’s, and an album that’s just one of the very best within the quintessential collectable’s of Roxy Music, featuring Mr. Bryan Ferry.
B000000OQY|3.0|I thought these guys were GREAT when AFD came out, but of course, money, fame and axl rose ruined all that.Nice Boys is a good cover of a Rose Tattoo song and Your're Crazy is the other good one, on this CD. I lost interest in gnr after this one
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This application works better than expected. The alarm wakes me up very smoothly and the application features are wonderful. It is one of the best application That I have downloaded to my Kindle.
1107699894|5.0|i want to improve my english language skills further. i'm sure that this book will help with that. i liked the print quality and the colorful illustrations. its printed in ITALY. The book was carefully packaged and sent to me by Amazon. so thank you.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Moriarty is the most detailed writer.  All of her descriptions are crisp and jump off the page.  This intersection of stories makes so much sense.  I love the ending beyond the ending.  It's not light.  But each action her characters take makes sense.  Each sentence they say - they are just at the right point in the book and in their lives to say it.  I could see every character as if it were a movie.<br /><br />My favorite things about this book: 1) the crisp, detailed, alive writing, 2) the characters themselves and how three-dimensional they are, 3) the storyline.
B0000CF35F|5.0|This is without question AC/DC's best CD with Bon(after Powerage) what else can be said that hasn't been said about Highway to Hell, it simply is ROCK 'n' ROLL at its FINEST
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|OMG am I having a blast with this game. You have to really concentrate on the table as its very busy, colorful, and active. I love a good challenge and this game is perfect to challenge yourself, or others. It's fun, free, and exciting. I LOVE IT.

B004X80QNG|5.0|This is a $10 app on the android market and i can see why. It organizes your stuff very neatly for you, I got it for free on Amazon Free App of the Day.
B0014DCTCY|5.0|One of the first albums they used danger mouse as producer.  Even though i enjoy their bluesier material,  this is a great album worth buying.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|This was a compete disappointment, and is so incredibly trite, cheesy and stale that I will not even bother to spend the time itemizing the number of times watching it invoked my gag reflex.  The storyline, photography, lighting, music were embarrassingly crappy and derivative, and I found myself feeling sorry for the actors, who were given this crappy production and expected to create something believable out of it.  I own every other motion picture release in the Star Trek genre, but this one I will be dropping off at the local Goodwill store.
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|I had heard all kinds of negative feedback. This movie was a lot of fun. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Through this book I learned a lot of new things, such as how Tesla was an amazing visionary and inventor. How Edison and J.p Morgan were not men of principles. And most important how I completely agree with the I.q and imagination topics. Very well written, I was very pleased to have come across this book and read it for free. I have been pensive on the subject of I.q for quite sometime now and although my I.q is average, I excel in creativity, persuasion and philosophy.
B008SOS63S|4.0|I think it's great, but I like the one in Venice just a bit better.  Great though as usual!  A also liked some of the artists he sang with.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Just got my Kindle Fire and wanted this app, worked one time.  It isn't worth the effort to keep trying to make it work.
B0000CF34J|4.0|Not my favorite AC/DC album but still has some GREAT SONGS. It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll), Live Wire,T.N.T., High Voltage, are the best cuts on this CD
B008602KQI|4.0|Good rendition of the book. The characters were well developed, the action was great, and true to the storyline. Can't wait for the next ones.
1439156816|5.0|Mr. King does not pull any punches and is direct and informative about the necessity to knuckle down and &#34;just do it&#34;.  For those of us who are plagued by doubts and other self-inflicted obstacles, I heartily thank him for providing a book to be read over and over, and refer to as often as necessary when the wee-bee jeebies attempt to impede progress.<br />-Slocol
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy this game - relaxing - easy to play - fun - keeps your mind active and helps distract you from problems.
B00499K9E0|5.0|This is a clever series, moving the story of Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick, Dr. Watson to the London of the 2000's. It's clever: Dr. Watson served in Afghanistan (just like the original.) He needs a flatmate (London is too pricey on a military pension but who'd want to live anywhere else?) Sherlock (marvelously played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a \\"consulting detective\\" and just as needed and despised of New Scotland Yard as Conan Doyle's was of the original Lestrade. Cumberbatch occasionally pulls a move to hark back to Jeremy Brett's interpretation of Holmes; a quick jump onto a table to sit cross-legged, the hands steepled under the chin when deep in thought.<br /><br />There are siz or so episodes with more to come. The quality of this series is astonishing; the writers really do get the feel of the fabled detective yet it moves seamlessly into modern London. The series music is quirky and fits so well it  becomes almost a character. I look forward to more episodes--this is really well-written television and a pleasure to watch.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|This movie was so rad. So jazzed that it got made at all. Such a good interpretation of the batman story.
140006922X|5.0|Great story of how stories get written and believed when not intended to be historical as the populace back then had no concept of history since about 98% of the population were illiterate. How things get interpreted to suite beliefs whether true or not. Recommended to be read with an open mind not to change anyone's beliefs, just to be understood how certain things come to be.
B000002J5K|5.0|This film is virtually flawless with the cast, with the music, and with the story line.  I have watched this film a dozen times, but I never tire of it.  The dancing when married to the music is flawless.  I can think of no film that is as entertaining at every level than &#34;The Blues Brothers.&#34;
B00CS7MQ1O|4.0|Season 1 & 3 both had frame freeze through out.  Other than that Seasons 1-5 are very funny, I still need to get Season 6.
006212725X|3.0|I just don't know what to make of this. Is my tepid rating for the book or Townshend?<br /><br />The band, as the first pages says, is Roger's thing, but everything that follows says that it's Pete's thing. Pete is not just writing music he's making personnel decisions; he's negotiating with managers, lawyers, signing rights. He's well into Quadrophenia before any mention of input from the band is mentioned.  After this and more, it's amazing that on p. 346, Townsend says \\"Roger was the unquestionable leader...but Roger was the leader and always had been.\\"<br /><br />This is just one of many non-sequitors, large and small.  There is his mother who ignores him throughout childhood only to clean his apartment at night once he moves out on his own. The Who's early period, characterized by guitar smashing and hotel wrecking, is understated as Townsend presents himself as a breadwinning work-a-holic dad. Yes, he's drinking a bit... but he's not taking drugs, except for this.. or that.  Just after he writes of his financial uncertainty, he is buying a boat, a house (or his wife is) or refurbishing a recording studio.<br /><br />On just about every page, a name is dropped. There is a lot of macho posturing, usually about women, but most strangely about eating flowers.  After purchasing a number of impressive cars, and a receiving a number of moving violations he writes \\" ...never much interested in cars apart from their ability to transport me quickly and safely.\\"<br /><br />After 500 pages, it is still not clear \\"Who he is\\". There is more about buying boats and setting up studios than there is about how he related to his band mates (for instance the reaction to the death of Keith Moon) or why he followed Maher Baba.  (I had to go to Wikipedia to learn what the religion was about.)  He falls in love not just once, but often.<br /><br />I come away with a number of feelings about all this. First is sadness for a lonely little boy. He seems to have grown into a man with an addictive profile who buried himself in work. His particular work was infused with the drama of the times.  Despite all that has been written about the generation gap, not many have related it to the preceding generation's trauma of war as Townsend has.  It seems that since he lost out on warmth and love as a child, he was unable to find connection as an adult.<br /><br />Townshend has created some great art and made some technological strides in music. He is definitely a foremost artist of \\"his\\" generation. Perhaps a future biographer will be able to interpret him in a more accessible way.ddictive profile who buried himself in work.

B0072GPQNG|4.0|I chose to &#34;like&#34; it right now but may change to &#34;love&#34; it later.  The cruelty of war, and especially in this time era when they used horses, is hard for me to see.<br />The story is well done realistically,, and the horse is fantastic.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|This book is an excellent book for anyone wanting to do anything with business. The ideas I learned in this book can cross over into any realm of your life, from personal growth to small business ventures. Well worth the read. The book has great insite that will help you out.

B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|Despite the name, this is not Star Trek. This is Star Trek in name only. Many see the &#34;reboot&#34; as bringing new life to a struggling franchise, but the fact of the matter is that Star Trek's time has simply come and gone. Thatt these &#34;reboot&#34; movies take place within an &#34;alternate timeline&#34; underscores the obvious that no, this is not the same franchise. By definition it is something new. For those who can get behind a new franchise of Star Trek themed action movies, the &#34;alternate timeline&#34; approach offers a tantalizing universe of possibilities, limited only by the imaginations of the filmmakers. And what do they come up with? A revamped version of The Wrath of Khan. Much has already been said about the many plot holes, lack of character development, and turning the characters into caricatures of their former selves (especially in the case of Khan, who is played SO far over the top that you'd think he's spoofing a comic book supervillain), but IMHO the biggest issue is the sheer lack of originality, especially given the boundless possibilities afforded by the new timeline. And to think that it took THREE grown men to come up with the script for this. Like many people, I don't care how many more of these movies they churn out. I've already seen enough.
1449433251|5.0|Every strip in date order for the length of its run in newspapers. Outstanding strip with so many of them that should be framed.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|It's certainly got lots of blood... Which, as far as I know, is very true to the comic. What this movie doesn't seem to have is any sort of intelligent core. There is no overarching statement behind anything in the film other than possibly, &#34;Don't be a bad guy cause bad guys get killed.&#34;<br /><br />I like Karl Urban and want to root for his career, but he doesn't have much of a chance to do anything in this movie. Not his fault. He's stuck under the gigantic Judge helmet without exception through the entire movie and seems to have been directed to be as one-note as possible.<br /><br />Lena Headey delivers the same, unexciting, perma-sour-face performance that she has made so famous, (and so disappointingly) as Cercei Lanister on Game Of Thrones. Not much to get excited about there.<br /><br />Mostly, you should watch this movie only if you can appreciate lots and lots of bullets flying and explosions and blood spattering with almost no decent story, dialogue, acting, or point.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Best racing game I've found so far. Works great on the kindle HD7. The menu is not very user-friendly, but once you figure it out the gameplay is great. Graphics are decent, also.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoyed the character development of these shows so much that I watched all seasons within 3 weeks. I also liked the tasteful nature of this series. It was not without romance but did not feel the need to be explicit about sex. I appreciate this. It leaves something for the imagination.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I have a number of old style power supplies.  The kids have older laptops (hand me downs) and the adults have newer laptops.  These convertors have been a life saver to make sure that every power supply in the house is accessible to any one.  In our collaborative workspace they have also done well for the same reason.
0375869026|5.0|This book was great.  I really liked the story, and thought it was a really good book.  Would recommend to most readers!
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|This movie is certainly worth watching, but it's not going to change anybodies life. Great idea for a sci-fi story, but the execution of the film is not always as good as it could be, (should be) considering the talent and potential of the story.<br /><br />In the future, a daily, mandatory drug treatment has been developed for all human kind to suppress emotions completely in order to assure peace. Unfortunately, most of the characters in the movie still seam maniacally happy, or angry at various points, even though they're not supposed to be able to feel these things. Mind you, this is a conundrum in some ways, because if everyone was emotionally flatlined throughout, as the story calls for, the film would probably feel even slower than it already does.<br /><br />Decent special effects considering they are primarily done with no CGI and some of the action sequences are pretty exciting, if your into good fight choreography.
0385338910|1.0|I had just read Tropper's \\"This Is Where I Leave You\\" and enjoyed it so much I decided to read another book of his. I chose this novel based on all the positive reviews - did I read the same book as everyone else? I just could not get into this book; it was slow and contrived (especially the ending). Most of the main characters are very rich, successful, and beautiful - plus they were pretty annoying, so they didn't elicit a lot of sympathy from me. And one other strange note: the main family is Jewish and their collective favorite oath appears to be \\"Jesus Christ!\\" or some variation of that. I'm not particularly religious but that was odd and a little off putting for me. I had to force myself to finish it, but I wish I never picked it up to begin with.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends. And I find great ideals on there too.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|Really liked the movie.  Great acting and idea.  Would be very cool to see a sequel.  Lets have them do another one.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Awesome game different from other jewel match games very excitlng never boring. Faced paced lots of action.I love this game. Highly recommend. this game! !!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars was very intriguing.  I could relate to the experiences of love, life, and death as told in the story. I usually can tell in the first few pages of a book if I would enjoy reading it -but I was held captive to this one and read it in one day.  The movements and actions of the characters were moving and also serious at points in the story.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|easy to use, great reminders for task bar. easy to move important saved notes from history of saves on sd card  to new phone when upgrading. not much choice in fonts or background but its just color notes, name says it all.
044024613X|5.0|This is a confusing situation where you never really find out the truth and the whole family is playing hidden games<br />And you have to read between the lines to figure out the truth
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|So my quarrel is not the fact that the movie is not like the book, I've read the book twice and watched the movie twice and enjoy them both. What I'm upset about is that I stupidly bought the 20 dollar instant video version and didn't know before hand that it wasn't the full cut. If you watch the \\"extended cut\\" you'll be happier I think. Great movie and I definitely recommend it.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Excellent movie. Draws you in. Suspenseful. Different from other zombie movies. Overall very enjoyable. Never read the book but not every movie has to be an exact copy of a book its based on but rather be entertaining.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|This is a great film score with a wide range of music to fit the scenes.  Listening to this will bring images from the movie to mind.  My only wish is that the title song by Adele should have been included.  (I have that on a separate CD).  I can listen to this over and over again.  Beautiful!
B004SIP9P6|5.0|Now THIS ends the series, I don't know why there's a 4th after this nor do I care. But the ending that I like besides the part where Sydney closes the fence. IS The movie ending that even goes with our wedding proposal. AND Lost Boys 3 these connect dear readers so check it out! Me and my guy have been setting up The Scream Killings with an ending like The Noxhema chick in Urban Legends.He gets a shoulder wound (just a wound, not as big as the one in the flick) and I grab his hand hoisting him up. A reporter (just a general one cause I like Monica in these movies) writes A book on what happened.) My guy has our wedding ring in the book...and after we get hitched we end up at a college showing the book; but the story in this book about this girl is a little off so I'm gonna tell you how it Really happened.
1439102813|5.0|There has been so much progress in understanding the actual mechanism of the progression of Alzheimer Disease<br />That if caught before the neurons die - the disease can be kept on hold.  Researchers have yet to discover how to<br />Remove the gel that forms in the synapses that prevents the passage of information from one neuron to the next.<br />If the neurons aren't being active because of this gel - the neuron dies and the pathways are permanently and<br />Irreversibly dead.  This is why early detection is so vital because at this point in time there is medicine that can<br />Stall the progression although the disease itself can never be &#34;cured&#34;.  The book goes into the fact that this Early Onset ( which can start as early as 45 yrs. Old and this type is inheritable) is not expected so it's vital to recognize<br />The very early symptoms which are very subtle and yet so crucial to the management of the disease. GREAT BOOK.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie.. Just like the book . They really hit the nail on the head with this one.. I'd watch it again
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am coming at this series of books backwards.  I began with the TV show, but wanted more faster. So - I started reading the books.<br /><br />I have to say, by 3/4ths of the way through this book - the TV show has diverged so far that it's like 2 different stories.  Similar, with characters that are clearly based on the books.  The thing that seems to be happening is, to keep the number of characters down (and save time) that they are omitting some characters and fusing others together.  That has driven the TV show in a slightly different direction.<br /><br />Regardless, after being dropped into Westeros unceremoniously in the first book - here in the second, the author seems to have found his stride and came to terms with fusing back story into progress.  I noticed his use of stories and songs, within the story, to carry history and serve as cautionary tails.<br /><br />Anyway, it's been a fantastic read.  A fantastical, world spanning epic.  And I can't wait to see what happens as magic reawakens into the world and the night comes.  It's going to completely rewrite the power structure.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have the entire collection of James Bond films and I love them all, but this has to be my absolute favorite!  As always the viewer gets to go to exotic locations and experience thrilling chases. BUT the showdown at Bond's childhood home is spectacular!  This is a must see!
B004SIP9O2|5.0|Hey it's the Living Dead Girl! I love this flick 2, wasn't sure if I would cause Billy Loomis wouldn't be in the film (it's like chucky without Tiffany it sucks!) But then we get Jackie as his mom(she's a great psycho I was actually surprised) I mean I guessed the other killer the one who's holding the gun and says Billy Loomises mother, but her I wasn't expecting. And that's me and my guy like to be Billy and Sydney (think a different ending) where I'm holding the knife saying, well you mess with me and my guy and I get a little knife happy (we also like writing different movie endings) My friends also wish we could write scary movies or Star in them...So these reviews are my latest fun project...enjoy readers...and onto Scream 3 and another cool new movie ending and then my reviews for Lost Boys.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|This is R&B, finally! This has got to be the best cd John has put out. If you love good music, this is a must have. It's good music for the soul.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Never had so much fun playing a game like this before. Keep coming up with new levels. The new beach is great
B00CATSONE|2.0|I picked up this book expecting it to be a biography, and found indstead a very short self-help book about \\"unlocking your inner genius\\" (okay, so that's probably not a direct quote, but that's the gist of the author's message). A disproportionately small portion of the book was actually about Tesla, and that portion was extremely cursory. I never got to know who Tesla actually was or what made him tick. The author simply mentioned some of his life events, and then made bold, declarative statements about Tesla's genius, imagination, and philanthropy, etc. etc. ad nauseum, hardly quoting Tesla at all. In all, a very disappointing read.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|The dialog is sometimes hard to understand but otherwise this is just outstanding.<br />So much better than what the networks have to offer.
B004SIP9MY|5.0|Hey it's the Living Dead Girl here (also known as The Scream Queen cause of this flick.) Plus the fact that I've been able to guess the main killers in Scary Movies since I was 8. I was in High school when I 1st saw this and I guessed both that night. 1st Billy, and its not the cell phone thing (it's from knowing every Wes Craven flick from when I was a kid.) When he gets stabbed by Stu (killer number 2 I guessed) there's no blood and Wes Craven uses buckets in his flicks...also just a sidenote; we all go a little mad sometimes...best line in the movie besides the one about not blaming movies for creating psychos(but don't worry dear readers I just think this stuff is fun I wouldn't really do anything like this) 2nd how I guessed Stu? Randy mentions all the rules...Stu disobeyed like every one and his body doesn't show up...well then that just made it easy(by the way when we 1st saw this I was the only one who guessed it, my husband didn't even guess everyone....but he's proud that I did so here's a shout out to you, love you babe!
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|This is great.  My granddaughter loves it.  Loves fixing things and the noises that it makes are amazing.  She spends alot of time with all of the Dr Pandas.  Keep them coming!
B000FBJG04|5.0|I have read this book from cover to cover several time since I purchased it a couple of years ago.  It has a good balance between the battle action that occurred and the relationships that each man built during that time in their lives.  It gives those of us who have never experienced battle first hand a little understanding of what people think in the midst of mayhem.  It also lets us taste a bit of the fear that the men felt prior to the jumps, attacks and defenses that they had to endure.<br />I am grateful to the men and women who sacrificed so much to allow us to have our freedoms.  What they did should never be taken for granted.
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|Exceptional. Wish that there was more than four songs. Great group. Looking forward to more. Keep on making music . Thank you. Your group is amazing.

B008MEM24S|5.0|Very simular to Where's My Water and Where's My Mickey this game is fun and easy to learn. However if you want to get all three knomes in each level you're going to have to put on your thinking cap. Tilt not needed so it will work on the Vinci tablets. Excellent for children and adults. Tablets are easier to play on but works on phones as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0015XAT3Y|3.0|Ok, this is an album of memories for most people and there's nothing wrong with that. I won't speak of the music here, that's your taste or not but I was disappointed with the sonics. I had hoped the remastering would have given the sound a sense of space and detail but it doesn't. The results are flat, fine for your car but if you have a decent home rig, you won't be getting much extra value from this (though three bonus tracks are a plus). Makes me wonder if it was all so processed to begin with that there is nothing that can be gained by remastering. Either that, or the earlier cd release must have really sounded bad.  Find a used LP version if care.
B00CBLQCO4|3.0|Espionage is no longer a polished pastime played by gentlemen. It is a business. Ideologies have been replaced by political and corporate expediency. The intelligence community and security forces are infiltrated by outsourced private enterprises. Casualties and collateral damage are now line items on a spreadsheet. Le Carre's 23rd novel attempts to be a contemporary statement but feels very 2007 with whistleblowers and private military contractors. The prose and pace worked for me, I would often re-read a turn of phrase for enjoyment. The first half of the book is incredibly engaging. I kept expecting to be completely fooled by a few twists and turns, yet there is no clever device, the book is a polemic on moral ambiguities. It loses steam, both righteous and otherwise, petering out to the point of stunning indifference.
B00AYB16EO|1.0|I like funny movies, I hate stupid movies. And they made a sequel.  So maybe it's me who is  stupid
B0027MJU00|4.0|Deeply damaged people seems to be the theme for all books by Gillian Flynn, and viewing the damage is not for the faint of heart.  Reading Dark Places is like (sorry for the cliche) driving by a bad car accidents...you don't really want to see the gore but can't not look.  Well written, yet finishing the book makes you feel somewhat ashamed for having read it.<br />Tv
B008IGAJJK|5.0|This is a classic!  I loved MASH when it first came out and still do. Was so happy to get it so I can watch often.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thought this book was well written. I had no knowledge of this in history, what a shame, hopefully all of the orphas ended up with a good family.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Classic. Love this movie and, for being so old, the graphics are great! Steven Spielberg could do no wrong back in the day...this and E.T.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I haven't been playing this game for long but so far it is better than most bubble shooters I have tried previously. I haven't had to pay money in it yet as I rarely use any power ups-it's easy and fun when you have nothing better to do. There have been a couple ads prompt me but nothing too invasive or frequent, especially for a free game. 5 stars until I find an actual dilemma
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Simple to read but deep in meaning. It was thought provoking and spoke to my heart. I will be thinking about this book for years to come.
B009MJU9QU|5.0|I got this for my granddaughter Chloe because she loves bears. I bought a whole family of figurines for her. Very realistic and she has so much fun playing with the figurines and reads to them from the bear books. Good price, good quality
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The Help Desk thought these items would correct a problem with my Kindle Fire but it didn't....product works wonderfully on my new Kindle purchased.
B008476HBM|3.0|I always have a hard time getting through the &#34;classics&#34;..this on is no exception.  REad it because it is a classic but not because I enjoyed it.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|This is a great show. I would recommend it to anyone who like SYFY. The plot & characters do a great job to keep the show interesting enough to stay with it to the very end & stiill want more.
B001R0CSXO|5.0|In my book, Schenker is one of the greatest guitarists ever. This album contains some of his best work. Simply classic album.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, the action and special effects were superb.  The story line centers on the perception of acceptance, which Judge Dredd is far from at the beginning of the film.  Karl Urban does justice to the roll of Judge Dredd, however, the protrayal by Stallon was better.  To truly enjoy this film, it is best not to compare the two films.  Or you may find yourself wanting.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Fasnating story, excellent acting, needs repeated watching, a reminder that freedom is NOT free. Has heros and villians. Thank you.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a really awesome game. don't listen to the reviews.Who ever says it sucks hadn't understood this game. Really awesome game
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is by far the best gaming headset that I have used to date.  It, also, works outstanding with Win 8 and many of the other programs on here.  The controls are all intuitive and the battery life on this headset has lasted me more than 9 hours of usage before I had to recharge it.  Plus the design lends itself to charging while using it, when it does get to that point.
B00AC8ZIXO|3.0|This is an OK story about the experience of several cadets prior to the invasion of Earth.  It follows one marine and his failings, his renewal of inner strength, and finally his acceptance of leadership.  It moves slowly at times, but does give you insight into the characters portrayed at the academy.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|A good beginning to a long run series I will continue to see it as I cycle the series and start over again.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Yes, I enjoy the Greedy Spider apps.  It's takes me many tries before I outsmart him - I never give up!  Fun, no matter how old you are!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|... for a fun look at teen angst! i really am glad I am not going to be a teenager again anytime soon! But I still like the show a lot.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great Film.  Keeps to the lore of Marvel and the Parthenon of Norse mythology.  Special effects are first rate, acting is well done.  You truly hate Thor at the beginning.  The story unfolds nicely and moves well.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Buy it! You make tower and travel also you don't HAVE to buy gems you earn them just for playing!!
6305428352|5.0|My mother loved it so much, that I ended up buying her this movie for Christmas...  She has watched it several times...  Great movie!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Not as humorous as I expected.  Acting was good.<br />Possibly I am just not tuned into the humor as it was presented.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I'm middle-aged, in my youth was a big Clash, Elvis Costello and Pretenders fan (among many other bands.)  I'm like an old feminine fart who complains about how most singers nowadays can't really sing and most of the music doesn't have much spirit or depth.  It's all so commercial - whine, whine, whine.  Well, Some Nights is probably also pretty commercial, I love it!!  Great to hear lyrics that aren't daft, a singer who can actually sing without autotune (and with it), and a band that is actually more than just pretty boys.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The graphics could have been better, but otherwise it's really good. Is there a sequel and if so where can I purchase it?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple to use on the KINDLE fire HD. I have found no bugs with this app. Loads very quickly. If you want a simple and easy calculator app, give it a try!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I thought this looked interesting with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in it.  I was wrong and very disappointed.  It was a weird story line and didn't even make much sense.  I felt it was a waste of time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Finished in a few hours, but lots of fun. Hope more levels are added soon. Couldn't stop playing it. Would definitely recommend this game.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Another fun game.... G5 never disappoints.... I love hidden object games and G5 has some of the best!!! If you are a fan of hidden object games,I recommend this one!!
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I enjoyed P.D.James visulation of how life had become for Elizabeth and Darcy...it was a walk down memory lane of Pride and Predjudice for me. All the characters were real and the story line was craftily written.  It was a good read from start to finish.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I love to read James Rollins. The way he takes historical facts and winds them into a story is amazing.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Watching these BBC shows has been one of my new things and this show has not disappointed, its a great show with lots of twists and turns and really have no idea who the killer is. I love this show and everyone should watch it
1439148813|4.0|Other reviewers have commented on Gene Kranz as an author, and there is some grounds for criticism there.  His style is dry and unadorned.  Personally, I think that's good for this book, but YMMV.<br /><br />What cannot be debated is his unique position as both an observer and a participant at the very heart of NASA activity in the 1960s.  Whatever strengths and flaws he has as a writer strike me as largely unimportant in view of the perspective on that time that he can offer.<br /><br />This is the memoir of an engineer, not of a poet, and this is why I generally disregard the dry style: I don't expect poetry, and I don't even really want it.  This is the nuts-and-bolts side of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, the ground crew that made it possible for Glenn to orbit, White to spacewalk, Anders to snap 'Earthrise', Armstrong to take that \\"one small step\\".  Kranz presents events with a technician's eye, giving the down to earth side of the greatest adventure humanity ever undertook, ultimately succeeding on a combination of rigorous preparation and brilliant improvisation.<br /><br />If you have a library of space race related books like I do, this needs to be in it.
B005SAP45I|5.0|My son loves this movie and I love having Amazon Prime because its so much cheaper to rent. It's a great kids movie.
0689878451|5.0|I work at a Christian church daycare teaching four and five year olds. Our boss, who sometimes just buys stuff without careful thought or reading over, bought this book from a children's book catalog and gave it too my class, since the age level is pre-k - 3rd grade. I had it sitting on my desk covered up for about two weeks, and my helper found it asked why it hadn't been read yet. I told her that I had forgotten about, which was true, and I hadn't read it to myself either. She read it over and said she was highly offended by the homo undertones of the book. I said I didn't care and read it to the class anyway and they loved it, as did I. Now I know the book has been on the ALA's top challenged and banned books of 2009, but I think this book is wonderful. I think kids should learn that being gay is okay and to learn acceptance and that some kids have a mommy and daddy, or two daddies, or two mommies. Parents at my daycare complained about the book and wanted it removed, and when I fought my boss and begged her to keep it, I cried. Kids need to learn about homosexual parents, and need to learn early.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for the animal lover in your family. My daughter love's horses, she enjoys caring for her virtual horses...it is as close to the real thing as she is going to get.
B00EBRWN80|2.0|This works if it doesn't close on you and go blank.this product needs work to make it easier to access.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Needed a wether app. decided on this one since it's what I always put on TV in the mornings before I start my day. App is convient and useful
B0006VBFM0|3.0|It wasn't the vibrant colors that are pictured in the ad.  It seemed 'washed' out.  I was disappointed because it was the brighter colors in the picture that sold me on the watch.
B004J09ONG|5.0|It is good to know about this real story. It is good education movie. I tell the story to my 8 year old daughter. She like the story and enjoyed watching the movie.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album is one that can be played from top to bottom. That is the non-deluxe album.<br /><br />The best songs IMO are (after overplaying the hits).......<br /><br />Amsterdam (the best on the album)<br />Hear Me<br />Every Night<br />Bleeding Out<br />Nothing Left To Say<br />Tip Toe<br /><br />This album would have been better if these songs plus Radioactive, It's Time, Demons, On Top Of The World made up the whole album and the rest dropped.<br /><br />As for sound, people aren't lying. Terrible awful production/mastering. I found if you turn down the bass all the way, it makes the mid bass not so distorted. The deeper bass still comes through, so lack of no bass does not suffer totally. I thought my KEF Q900 speakers blew it sounded so bad. This is not the greatest way to listen to the album, but I love it so much I had to tinker to make it listenable.<br /><br />Hopefully someday a better mastering comes out. Amature job done on this album and not the style/sound for this type of music. It needs to reflect the songs and music and the producer failed thinking he was cooler than he really is.<br /><br />The band should have stepped in and said something. If I were the band I would have felt like my art was destroyed by this kidish looking amature.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Absolutely Loved It! Did Not Expect To, But I Could Not Put It Down!!! Read This Phenomenal Book, Immediately!!! Amazing
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|We bought this for our Granddaughters' 4th birthday. She loves this story. I think the first Toy Story is the best one. I would recommend buying it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm only on level 5, but so far, I love it. They give no instructions or clues. You just have to &quot;figure it out&quot;.
B0067EPIY6|5.0|Not having purchased a Mel C album since &#34;Northern Star&#34; (which I love), I gave this album a chance based on reviews and the gorgeous album cover. I know that is rather silly, but obviously it was the right choice because I am in love with this album. The tracks flow so nicely from song to song. I am not disappointed at all in my purchase and I would venture to say it is a step up from &#34;Northern Star&#34;. Very impressed. I will have to discover her material between these two albums now.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I've been playing magic ever since it was invented. I let it go to the wayside in recent years. Then I found this app. Stunning graphics and the game play is great. I spent the 10 bucks on the paid version and  its worth every penny.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes though but they might be a related to game balance.<br />1) where are the Kurd Apes?<br />2) where is fireball?<br />3) where are the triple mana creatures such as Ship of the Dead?<br /><br />I found blocking to be a bit troublesome at first. I hope this is addressed in future releases.<br /><br />It would be great to be able to play against people all over the world. The lack of this feature is the only reason I don't give it five stars.<br /><br />I do love the fact that I don't have to go out and spend 1000 bucks on cards to build the best deck. 10 bucks is well worth the price. The computer opponents are fun to fight and the local play is good as well. Keep up the good work and if you are a fan of magic this is definitely the game you want.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Before I got this app I was never able to find the percentage of how charged my kindle battery was, but after getting this app I no longer have to worry. Because this app let's me know in one easy touch on my screen!!! I'm so happy I downloaded this!!!
B00915G6MG|1.0|It takes a tremendous amount of effort to screw up a show as good as NCIS. But the producers of season 10 have risen to the task. Even JAG's A.J. Chegwidden and the back from the dead Tommy Franks can't unscrew this mess of a story arc.  A tremendously talented corps of actors was left to gnaw on the scenery, emoting their way through a season of disjointed flashbacks interspersed with occasional criminal activity.  Humorless, pointlessly pensive and without any real dramatic tension, someone should investigate what's been done to NCIS. Even William Webb, one of the greatest D.P.'s in the industry, was left with nothing to photograph. What does it say when a guy as good as Mr. Webb, who could create interesting images of a dead flounder, struggles to find something to photograph. I'd be embarrassed to take credit for any of this mess.<br />Audio and video were out of sync on our burn. Two episodes may have been out of sequence. I can't tell, as we don't watch in real time. Was there supposed to be a complete episode between Tony and Ziva's accident and further mention?<br />No wonder Cote de Pablo wants out!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Peter, Enchantment and Stardust is a truly enchanting read for children and adults, filled with places only found in dreams. William really knows how to see through the eyes of a child and seems to understand the things that capture a young one's attention. From the fairies and mystical rainbows to scary folk and the trolls crawling around the trees, it shows such a creative mind at work. A wonderful book!
B00C5R8364|5.0|I'm glad to see Forsyth tackling our post 9-11 world.  I hope he keeps going and going!  Well developed characters and believable scenarios.  I can't wait to see what he cooks up next!
B00DL47RQ2|1.0|\\"Blue Jasmine\\"'s ineptitude angered and offended me. Moviegoers deserve better than this amateurish botch. This review reveals key plot points. Don't read this review if you don't want to know what happens. Let's face it, though, not a lot happens in \\"Blue Jasmine.\\" What does happen onscreen is devoid of artistic truth, verisimilitude, insight or craft.<br /><br />Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) is the beautiful widow of Hal Francis, a Bernie-Madoff like corrupt wheeler-dealer. The FBI has caught up with Hal and arrested him. He commits suicide in prison. Jasmine travels from NYC to San Francisco to live with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Ginger used to be married to Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) but Ginger is currently involved with Chili (Bobby Cannavale.)<br /><br />Jasmine tries to make a go of it. There is some tension as she is living in her sister's apartment. Jasmine gets a job, meets a man, and studies interior decorating. Things go badly and the movie ends exactly as it begins: with Jasmine talking to herself.<br /><br />And that's it. That's the entire waste-of-your-time movie.<br /><br />The premise is tremendous: how the wife of a Bernie-Madoff style wheeler dealer copes with her sudden stratospheric loss of income and prestige. Does she sink or swim? Is she redeemed or doomed? \\"Blue Jasmine\\" does nothing with those fascinating questions. Things are at the end of the movie exactly as they were at the beginning.<br /><br />Woody Allen wrote a lifeless, inept script.<br /><br />Allen tosses one potential plot element into the film after another: the aforementioned loss of money and status, mental illness, abusive relationships, adultery, prescription drugs, class relations, sister relationships, adoption, step parenting, sexual harassment at the workplace. Then Allen does absolutely nothing with any of these.<br /><br />We see Hal kissing women not his wife. We see Augie talking to Hal about money. We see working class people drinking beer and watching sports on TV. None of this goes anywhere. It's all just aborted, disjointed scenes with zero verisimilitude; hollow scenes that arouse not one whit of care or involvement. I didn't believe anything in this movie. Every character's dialogue sounds so similar that I was painfully aware that it was not real people's speech, but words written by Woody Allen. Events occur with no believability.<br /><br />Jasmine drops a dime on Hal as soon as he tells her that he wants to leave her for another woman. A con artist of Hal's magnitude would not do something so naïve as to tell his wife, who knows of his financial misdeeds, that he is going to dump her. She would obviously get revenge the only way she can - by immediately phoning the FBI.<br /><br />Ginger is a two dimensional character. No reason is given for her to do anything she does, including taking in Jasmine. Jasmine had been rude to her earlier in the film, and Ginger is not a particularly nice person. The movie takes pains to tell us that Jasmine and Ginger were adopted, and this information serves no point whatsoever. There's no reason for Ginger to have two men: Augie and Chili are virtually the same character. Jasmine has a step son; there's no reason for him not to be her real son.<br /><br />The movie tells us that Jasmine is on edge, alone and without resources. The movie lies; in other scenes, the movie tells us that Jasmine is utterly irresistible to men. Every man she meets wants to make love to her, date her, and marry her. Surely one of Hal's friends, as soon as Hal went to prison, would have scooped up luscious Jasmine, and Jasmine would have accepted.<br /><br />The movie tells us that Jasmine is the kind of resourceful woman who can be born poor and marry one of the richest men in the country. How did that change and how did Jasmine become a pathetic basket case? It's just not believable.<br /><br />A diplomat proposes marriage to Jasmine after dating her for about fifteen minutes. Not believable. Then he immediately cancels the engagement because Jasmine is not what he had thought. Also not believable.<br /><br />It's impossible to care about any of the characters in the film, from the smarmy dentist to the diplomat who proposes to Jasmine, not just because none of them are nice or even rational people, but because they are boring, two dimensional, and lifeless.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett's performance is excellent. I did get sick of the tic Allen had her, or allowed her, to perform over and over: shaking Xanax tablets out of a brown prescription bottle into her hand and swallowing them down, followed by a swig of vodka. This gesture was repeated so many times it became stale. Yes, yes, we get it - Jasmine is a nervous wreck.<br /><br />This movie bugs me because it is so amazingly badly made. The most basic manual on how to construct a plot or develop a character would have steered Allen away from the choices he made. I'm angry that reviewers gave his mess a thumb's up. It's troubling that there are gifted scriptwriters out there who can't get produced while Allen's big name lures filmgoers.mmediately cancels the engagement because Jasmine is not what he had thought.

B00B22ASUM|5.0|Animals have long been known for their abilities to affect humans--calming, inspiring, loving unconditionally, tending the sick.  This story of Bob  and James emphasizes all of these qualities in addressing life on the street, loneliness, and heroin addiction.  It's a natural leap, and a simple but magical story of two strays who found each other.  In a more philosophical vein, perhaps Bob represents the Divine--the spiritual element of our world.  But to stray far from the simplicity of this beautiful gem of a story is not necessary to its meaning. As a recovered heroin addict, I can attest to the factuality and believability of this excellent book.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Standard email client for Kindle Fire. Works well, no problems as long as you are connected to the Internet. Remember, Kindle Fire is wireless only.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy the fact that it gives you an audio option as well.<br />App is very user friendly. Love having the bible at a finger tip.
B00AWCHQNK|4.0|So i made an error and read this book before the Maze Runner Series and have since found out that I have probably ruined the series for myself.<br /><br />So since i cannot judge the book as a tie together for the series, i will instead judge it as a standalone book.<br /><br />This book had plenty of action, emotion and a wicked surprise ending i did not see coming.<br />The lead Characters, Mark, Alec, Trina, and Lana are all strong believable characters, and the crazy people...well they are spookily scary.<br /><br />All in all (for a stand alone) it was a great book, and i would recommend it to everyone.
B006QQ77F8|5.0|I rented this movie thinking that it was the re-make, but even though it wasn't, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. I think it is probably better than the re-make
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|This probably won't change your life or give you the kind of insight that makes you a better, or smarter person, but if you aren't amused (assuming you like dark fiction of course) I would be surprised.  This show is  just awesome TV- really clever stuff.  You may be able to see what's coming next, or not-  whatever it's good pulp horror.  Great action, great sets.. everything  comes together to make this an hour well spent.<br /><br />If you really want to change your life- read,  Grapes of Wrath. Nothing beats it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This app is really awesome if you love spider solitaire. I literally cannot put it down! I am only 13 and I play game after game after game for hours on end. I truly recommend this app for all ages!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book.. All these books had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation.  Such a great read! I am looking forward to reading more of her books.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|It was not the scariest movie, but it wasn't bad. The good thing about the movie was that it had a lot of action throughout the movie, which made it more exciting.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Great book.  The final ending was sort of anti climactic.  Leaves you feeling a little bit like someone just had no idea how to resolve things satisfactorily.  Still great up Until that minute.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|That's what Aslan does: pick and choose which passages he takes literally and completely and which he dismisses with distain.  He's an elephant in a china shop.  There is no hint of respect for the Biblical narrative.  Much of what he says in known by even the casual scholar who is familiar with the historical-critical approach.  But the dismissive way he shares the information and the absolute certainty with which he proceeds is off-putting and arrogant.
B004CURZFC|5.0|It held my interest all the way through the movie.  I would defiantly recommend this movie to my friends. Great for children too.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was very suspenseful. It kept me guessing on what was really going on. I actually was very surprised at the outcomes. It was not predictable.
B00755MHXG|5.0|I loved the way this author took me inside the head of August and those who know him. I felt privileged to see his story from multiple perspectives. A very uplifting book.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|A riveting look at politics. Kevin Spacey is spectacular, if not loveable.  What an actor!  When is season 2 coming out?
0316201545|5.0|AMAZING. Is the only word that comes to mind. It was sooooooo surprising when Alex stayed behind instead of going home with connor. It was sooooooo super touching when dr.Bob proposed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great and really fun ! It always keeps you occupied and its good entertainment !  I say you get it !
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I had to adjust to the new format,but recently I realized that there is more info and it is more useful.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I liked it when I streamed it early, and when I finally got around to buying it, I've already listened to it more than I thought in the 2 last weeks. The inherent catchiness sneaks up on you.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The book is in the typical vein of Preston/Childs, Two Graves is a page turner that is hard to put down.  Everything is made clear in this book including why Helen faked her own death and how.  There are some interesting twists, as usual, in this story.  I highly recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Huge improvement. Charges really fast. Fits in the Kindle slot well and stays put much better than the old one.I only wish it folded flatter and were in the color white instead of black. Service was excellent. Thanks
B004LROUNG|4.0|Another great read by John Grisham. I have been a fan of this author for years. This was easy read and even had some good humor . Highly recommend.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|My Kindle Fire didn't come with a calendar app like the one I have on my iPhone. For those that miss that feature, this app provides. it.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I've been watching the tv series and love it, so I wanted to read the books. Damn! Craig Johnson has captured the romantic wilderness of Wyoming with the dedicated view of a native and propels the reader along for a suspense-filled ride. The mystery is compelling and the characters endearing. I will read on.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love bubble which there are no flaws on my kindle fire and the only bad thing with  app is that it take  half an hour for the lives to build up.  :( + :) = bubble which saga!!!!
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|Really good, the effects were pretty well done and the story line was really interesting.  I hope they can make a sequel
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was recommended and a good read it was. It chronicles the diagnosis of Alzheimer's in a highly productive and successful woman and how the disease affects her family and herself. This was informative and factual based with research done by the author. It's very well written and positive in nature in spite of the subject matter.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|This is a Jane Austin book.  Its a classic people!  Jane is in a realm of her own.  As with all her books it can be read in one sitting or in short bits the pleasure of her writing is still there, no matter how many times you might have read it.
B004SBULWE|1.0|Doesn't work with gmail on android tablet--keeps trying to reload it. Interfered with Gmail. Can't use.  Anyone else with this problem
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Extremely Loud and Incredibly close was a captivating movie that brought a different perspective to the events that occurred on and after 9-11.  We really enjoyed this movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic book! Could not put it down. Great fun. Been a long time since I read a book this quickly.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|A good pickup to carry on where old trekkers left off.The aspect of going to space does still exist with this movie.
B00EE3FTNM|1.0|The Brits have a flair for storytelling. I love the music and the filming. It's also nice to see favorite stars in a new setting.
0142501123|5.0|I love reading it and the kids love hearing it.  It is a win for everyone.  Seriously good book!  Buy it
0062255657|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The reader will be sucked in and not want to put the book down, which in this case won't be too hard, as it is more of a novella than a novel.  I wish it had been longer!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever made not as good as xbox but still great app love it but there are no caves which is not bad but I would suggest that there would be calves.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy and fun just like the card game.  Great way to chill out and take a break when you only have a few minutes.  I have loved solitaire for years and am glad to have it on my Kindle.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I am a happy owner of a Withings wireless scale and pre-ordered the Pulse when it was announced. It functions reasonably well as a pedometer, giving an accurate count of the number of steps that I take while walking. It is prone to miscount a bouncy bus commute that I sometimes take as an additional several hundred steps, though. I reported this to Withings support in late July 2013 and received a response stating that step-detection was being improved and that it would eventually be possible to edit steps data in the online app, but I haven't noticed any changes yet (mid-September 2013).<br /><br />The Pulse is quite lacking in its other functions, though. I've found its pulse measurement to be so unreliable as to be useless. Nearly half of the time, it reports that it is unable to take a reading at all. On other occasions, I've seen it report numbers in the 150-180 BPM range; a second measurement immediately after gave a more plausible 50-60 BPM.<br /><br />The sleep monitoring feature seemed interesting at first. The Pulse comes with a wristband to let you wear it while asleep (side note: the strap's velcro detached almost immediately and I had to reglue it). Based on motion, it attempts to classify the night into \\"awake\\", \\"light sleep\\", and \\"deep sleep\\" portions. Initially, it seemed to be reasonably accurate, but I stopped using it after it incorrectly reported me as being awake for several long stretches of time during a period where I believe I was asleep. What's the point of collecting data if you can't trust it?<br /><br />The Pulse is a well-designed piece of hardware that functions well as a pedometer, and being able to sync data to a phone via BlueTooth is convenient (although I note that there's still no way to export that data from Withings's website -- another promised feature that they're taking their time to implement), but the heart rate and sleep monitoring functions are so half-baked and unreliable that I'd have a hard time recommending it over acheaper, single-function pedometer.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|The Holocaust has always intrigued me. I'm not Jewish but love to learn about that part of history. This film is heartfelt, touching, and gives hope that maybe there were situations like this during that time. There is a valuable lesson to be learned with The Boy in the Striped Pajamas if you are willing to see it. Seller was also excellent.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game I have ever played. I have played a lot of bingo games and this one has what it takes to keep me coming back to play. The daily free tournament, is a great asset, daily credits, slots and special rooms help make this app playable daily. Love, love, this app.
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|the performance which makes this film come to life is penelope cruz's for which she won an Oscar. she plays javier bardeem's ex wife.  the two of them are both artists.  she is the more talented of the two but also the crazier...way, way crazy.  she has spent time going in and out of mental institutions. the film does not open with them though.  it opens with two women, vicky and christina, who come to barcelona, spain to partially work and partially vacation. they are both lightly allied to the arts but nothing like the other two. because bardeem is now single he begins romancing both vicky and christina and even starts living with one of them.  this is when his ex show up on the scene and the film really takes off.<br /><br />then the meditation on art and relationships begins.  having a sane person around stabilizes the two spanish artists so they work best on all levels in a threesome.  they even can teach the less talented and bring out their smaller talents! leave them on their own and all hell breaks loose. there are many levels going on here.  i thought the whole art relationship dichotomy was brought into sharpest relief when one of the woman thinks of leaving her boring banker husband UNTIL she discovers just how crazy these two artists can be.<br /><br />this was one of allen's most popular films in years and helped establish his period spent filming in Europe instead of New York.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005FRF6PC|5.0|I appreciate the way the book was written, effortless and so easy to read. There is much warmth in the story-telling and the absence of arrogance and aloofness that makes Rafa such an endearing read.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|A very unique movie to say the least...  At first...during the introduction...I was not impressed...but then the great music started and the characters started to form...and voila...hated to see it end.  The movie is especially impressive in Blu-Ray...and definitely run it through your audio system, or you will lose the great music and sound quality.  A must see.  Only suggestion would be to provide a music CD of the movie verses a digital copy...as one would truely love playing that CD many...many times.  T. Nelson
B002RSQGQK|4.0|A classic! When you want to appreciate a master visionary who didn't rely on technology to impress or entertain  the audience
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|It's always fun watching Arnie in action, it's been a while since he's done a full film and while this is far from his best, it's still a decent watch. The story is simple, Arnie is a sheriff in a small town on the Mexican border. Forest Whitaker is in charge of an FBI team transporting the head of the cartel, who subsequently escapes and his path to Mexico runs through the small, once peaceful town.<br /><br />It doesn't take long to get going and it doesn't take itself too seriously. The action is over the top with some amusing moments dotted throughout. Jonny Knoxville as the deranged gun nut provides most of these moments and he's actually not too annoying.<br /><br />All in all it's an entertaining watch with a few jokes, mostly poking at Arnie's previous films. Not bad at all.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Overall i thought the movie was decent, could have choose a different story line, love the special effects, watch and enjoy!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I used to enjoy this game until they decided to put an actual commercial integrated into the game. Now you can't even change screens without the commercial coming on! Seriously considering uninstalling now and I've been playing this for almost 8 months!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This series is the BEST!!  We enjoy the characters and the excellency of the performers that portray them.  We love how they play off each other and make this series one of the most enjoyable ones that we watch.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book.  However it is not for those who do not understand research or numbers or data.  I work with data daily and it was still difficult to read.  I liked the content and would recommend that to my parents, but they would not be able to get past all the numbers.  I'm sure they wouldn't read it even though they probably should.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Although there are loose ends in the novel (characters who aren't fully developed), it is a complex novel with layers of meaning. Hosseini's use of language is stunning--striking metaphors and descriptions that grab you and won't let go. This book is not as visceral as his previous 2 books, but nonetheless haunting.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Loved this book. Many times I laughed out loud but also was near tears in parts. The characters were well developed and the subtle and quirky humor was uplifting for such a heavy subject.
B00766ZW8G|5.0|We think we know who and what Frankenstein is, but until you read the real story by Mary Shelley, we haven't a clue. I am so glad I chose a summer read from my son's Summer Reading List. Kudos to his school for putting it on the list.
B005COO1X6|2.0|It doesn't become clear until near the (rapidly reached) end of this short story, that King is most certainly not at his best in this book. Would not recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Stephen King's work, nor do I find it original.
0060853972|5.0|this is one of my top ten favorite books.  I have actually bought this book more than a dozen times, several times for myself, and as presents for my favorite people.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's really good and fun but... it has some issues for me.I'm trying to get rainbow blade in Zen mode but sometimes when I start it shows the time and fruit go by but I can't move my blade like it's frozen.I don't want to delete it and lose all my progress
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is a excellent villain!  The movie, like the last one, cleverly blends plot element from both the original TV series and earlier movies into the plot but it is done with just enough twists to make it really work.  The development of the Kirk/Spock relationship is interesting and the remainder of the crew are portrayed in a manner that should make even the most hard-core Trekkie's smile.  These last two films are clearly the best of the lot.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I have read a bunch of military history, especially Viet Nam and now the gulf war.  This was a poorly written book, very chopped up and difficult to read.  When a book is good, it is hard to put down- this book was hard to keep open.<br /><br />I admire Mr. Kyle's service to his county very much...
B009AMAJVO|1.0|I never get my purchase and the page does not give me the option of claiming. I ask you to solve the problem. People can not find my package USPS. Already claimed several times and my address is 50 meters from the distribution center. These people lost my purchase.
B00AAL6288|4.0|I have been using Justins book while going through his beginners course online. It is easy to follow and well thought out. I would give 5 stars but I dont like some of the songs.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book captures something essential about youth, the power of kindness, the strength of character, and the virtue of surviving being different. I recommend this book to adults and to children alike--  in fact, this would be a great book to read aloud. If you are anything like me, it will make you get teary and snotty. In a good way.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|Amazing album from an amazing band, their best yet. The singer is great, the musicianship is incredible, a good variety of songs!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is fun and very addictive! I can sit &amp; play this for hours...very time consuming. I would most definately recommend this to someone!
B005HEPN06|5.0|Next generation has always been my favorite of all the Star Trek series.  This series is is as good as the first 3
B00947N6D8|5.0|I am really glad that I can get a movie or show on line and watch them whenever I want on any of the computer’s and or kindle, android devises etc. Thought this movie was good to watch.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Excellent read-great blend of science, economics, management and immensely useable tips.  A must for educators, managers, employees, indeed anyone. Only wish I bought the physical vision to share!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan, but I thought the concept was interesting.  The ending was also very interesting.  Overall I consider it to be a good movie, but not great.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Another exceptional yarn with  Stieg.  SALANDER will always prevail.  Can't wait for the last installment ..... with the tatood heroin ...
B002ZG9800|3.0|Good movie but way to graffic. It tells the story of a man who starts out as a cop then turns into a conman the relizes he is gay even tho he is married with two kids he then dates this guy ends up in prison finds the love of his life and spends the rest of his life in and out of jail being a conman
B00004TDTO|5.0|This one really let's your imagination go. You can watch it a dozen times and still get startled by it. An oldie but still a goodie.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Love, Love, Love all of the songs !  Some amazing writers and awesome performers!<br /><br />Can't wait for season two to start!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it!  Love it!! Love it, can't wait for season 4, Hate they killed Matthew, sorry he wanted to leave
B00E7SID9G|5.0|This book was quite enjoyable. It was fluid and extremely easy to ready given the complexity of the topic. The author does a wonderful job of compiling centuries worth of information, stories, and different interpretations to tell prove his arguments. Moreover, every chapter is interconnected as the author constantly reminds the reader of important details that contribute to the story telling. There is a lot of information to comprehend and analyze and it's arrangement is masterful.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I believe that even the kids might like this one day as much as the adults !!! This is really a good clean comedy that all kids from 8 to 80 like. We need more of these.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Great graphics and easy to use but as always they want money for you to get very far. You can always just keep playing the same levels over and over again but it takes forever and it isn't fun when you have played a level for the two hundredth time. Still it is fun and doable.
0486278077|5.0|My daughter had to read this book for English class and she love it. She will recommend it for teens 17 and over.
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun to play.....some levels lost before u even start the game.  can not wait until there are additional levels to play.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|My son loved it. It is a great family movie. Great visual effects also. well worth watching. again, and again.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|THIS APP IS AWESOME AND I USE IT ALL THE TIME!!!! It really helps if u dont wanna take a pic too close!! XD it's worth it!!!!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Amazing to watch. It is the same old show but the added special effects almost like watching an entirely new series. Buy it for the show and stay foe the added effects.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This works great on my Kindle Fire.  Advertisers are very accommodating. They make it easy to opt out if you desire.  I highly recommend this app.  It is very user friendly.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I saw that movie years ago. I was very nice to see again, because my girlfriend gave me a shirt where is written &#34;Save Ferris&#34; and yesterday, when I was using that,  tree people said that they have seen the movie and loved it. It is a classic.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Love and appreciation will fill your soul when you give this wonderful present to someone you care about.  There are more comics than have ever been shown online and all readers will find you a little more awesome after seeing this in your possession.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun.... I just wish there was an easier way to collect Grub coins, other than having to buy them with real money.
B000IZBP56|5.0|In today's world of redoing the same movie or story line over and over, this one is different.  We really enjoyed it, even though it's got the blonde Keanu Reeves (Paul Walker) who couldn't act his way out of a wet paperbag.  And the almost as bad Francis O'Conner, Gerard Butler is awesome and gets to be all Scotish!  It's fun and exciting, I would definitely recommend it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|...and as long as you keep playing and earning coin, you never need to spend coin to get coin! I love this game and not just in the bathroom :P
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season. The Merle/Daryl sorts line is encompassing and intense. Rick has overcome his emotional instability and Michone is an asset to the group
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like how they took the despicibal me theme and are it into minion rush.<br />All though it takes pretty long to load in the beginning.
B00DQ8GDV8|5.0|Fascinating, easy to read and understand! This book presents archeology with a simple aproach and exploiting every possibility analising cause and effect.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun and simple, great graphics and excellent gameplay.There is not much more you could hope to get from  free game
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Awesome game<br />!!!!!!!!!That needs to be free and needs to get more guns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />;;&amp;:&amp;__+$:<br />Derek w I ed nd news Chen said I will also read the
B002SAUCBC|3.0|As a fan of Stephen King I didn't quite like Richard Bachman's work that much. The fact that Bachman is Stephen King fooled me into thinking their work would be very similar. I guess I was wrong.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I Love this game on my android htc phone. I am going to get a tablet now so I can have it on a larger screen.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I am so addicted to it. I Use it everyday. It is so easy to navigate. Also a great place to get great ideas!!!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Rather nice fairy tale, I thought.  Twisty, with decent action, some fun dialogue, good looking characters, and nice settings. Happy ending- what more could you ask for?  Magical enough for at least 4.5 stars in my book!
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|Real people, real homes, real problems, no Hollywood, no glamour, no famous actress playing the lead. It is so believable a story that you get quickly and easily sucked into the whodunit theme you CANNOT miss a single episode. And every time you believe that the show is getting a bit stale, something incredible changes the storyline or the possible suspect in the death of an 11 year old boy.<br /><br />I am so glad the British do not try at all to emulate American TV shows because they usually have the best and most interesting storylines, characters and mysteries, than I have ever seen or enjoyed more.  At first I found myself addicted to Orphan Black, ANOTHER great BBC story, I believe produced in Canada.  Was hanging on every episode then, only to find myself drawn back into yet another classic story.<br /><br />Being a Doctor Who fan (from 63 - present) I did not just start watching BroadChurch because David Tennant was in this, though I must admit I didn't think I could take him out of the Tardis and into a Police Office, but he worked it.  Not only do you not get ANY hint of his Doctor Who persona, but he literally reinvents himself into this new DI Officer who is so believable that I do not think about Doctor Who at all while watching him.  Only a truly great actor can pull off something with that strong of a tie-in to a singular famous BBC TV Character.<br /><br />Kudos to the Brits and I hope we see even more of these kind of shows in the future.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Michael
0425266060|5.0|I've finished the last book. A little bummed because I want to keep reading and having Eva and Gideon my daily escape
0446310786|5.0|Like new it was so very gently used. The shipping seemed to take a whole bit it arrived in time for classroom use.<br />Thanks for offering it at a good price.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It helped me clear up an issue with my Kindle Fire, where the icons were blank (grey) and I could not open them.
B001KRVLCI|2.0|You could do an entire Mythbusters episode from this movie.  The plot is somewhat interesting but none of the things they do is possible.  The face transplants, the gun fights, on and on.  I know movies are supposed to be stupid and stuff doesn't happen like in real life but I have limits on the number of myths I can tolerate.
1452126607|3.0|Maybe this cat is just tired of being exploited---it has been all over You-Tube and the social media. The photo captions are clever and witty, but the actual photos are a little depressing to look at all year long.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Reading the book \\"The Lost Symbol\\" reinforced some of my beliefs in what God intended for us to do in life.  Use his gift to inspire and improve all that live here on this earth.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I just got mine last week. The setup for iPhone and iPad was flawless but my Windows notebook suffered and it still doesn't quite work. I started with Internet Explorer open to their setup page as instructed and then somehow the process got the Chrome Browser involved and that's when I probably messed it up. It may be half installed in IE and half in Chrome. The downside is that it only has YouTube and Netflix at the moment. I suppose that can increase over time and I'll up the rating as more apps arrive but only having these two is pretty useless since every TV or DVD Player or Roku-AppleTV-like device on the market will do more. I was also under the impression that this device would allow me to mirror my device screen on my TV but it doesn't (yet). It also requires that a device (smartphone, tablet, Laptop) be present to act like a smart remote control. I suppose that eliminating a standard remote control for basic lean-back operation was a sacrifice to achieve this low price point.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The most widely known true story, performed by superb actors and directed by skillful movie-makers. I have been following the UBL's story since 9/11 and was confident that Americans will do what they say they will do, \\"capture or kill Bin Laden\\", \\"wanted, dead or live\\".  Job well done!
0765365278|5.0|Was kinda 'meh' about Sanderson up until now.  This book managed to pull me in; then keep me there.  Reading the book was effortless.
B003WTE886|5.0|OK, this educator and author admires and appreciates and has been highly impressed with Taylor Swift since her earlier days of writing and singing.  She simply keeps getting better and better, like \\"Speak Now.\\"  And what does this savvy Yogi Bare admire the most about her?  As a young coed, she had a DREAM...about writing true stories about relationships, love...always WITHOUT the crummy gar-bage our recent Amer-i-can society has come to be bombarded with too often!<br />Taylor Swift has remained true to her DREAM, becoming a sensational success...the decent way!!!<br />\\"Speak Now\\"....in my collection!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I had a little trouble with the character changes at first until I figured out that there was about 3 stories going on. Then I began to enjoy it. I even skipped a few chapters in order to find out the secret and then came back to fill in the other chapters. It was suspenseful and kept me wanting to read it faster. I liked the Epilogue which tied everything together. I read it twice to make sure I understood it. I would recommend it for a rainy weekend read at the beach by a fire.  You will not be disappointed.
B0038LB3YK|5.0|This book provides an extremely detailed &#34;insiders&#34; account of the &#34;War on Drugs&#34; from the 60's to present day.  Through the eyes of the &#34;narcos&#34; and law enforcement, Winslow has written an intricate tale that truly captures the breadth of the problem as well as the inadequacies of trying to contain it.  Although it is a violent story, the violence is never graphically reproduced. So while harrowing, still allows the reader to enjoy without clutching one's stomach.<br /><br />This is an incredibly powerful book, one that will lurk in your subconscious long after you've finished the last page.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is the real deal. A science app with just about no limit. I've not found one . 2 thumbs way up
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Really enjoyable. Apple fan or not, this is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in business and how one man changed computers/music/phones/movies/books forever.
B0013UIUBC|3.0|I think Aaron Eckhart is convincing, and of course, Abigail Breslin is amazing!  There was some good directing, but I'm not sure Zeta-Jones pulls off the somewhat detached aunt very well.  I also didn't feel like the therapy sessions dug up the reasons why she was so messed up, and therefore undermined the foundations of character development a bit.  However, it's an endearing love story - not just in the romantic sense, but in the sense of two adults lavishing their love on a very cool but grieving little girl.  Eckhart and Breslin together were some of the best moments in the movie.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I read about 30-40 novels every year, and so far in 2013, this is the standout by some margin. &#34;I am Pilgrim&#34; opens your eyes to the possibilities for terrorists and the lengths that they will go too.  Obviously this is a novel, not an historical treatise, so should be read as such, but one cannot help but feel that it really isn't that far from the truth.<br /><br />Written with eloquent and precise prose, &#34;I am Pilgrim&#34; is an absolute beauty!
0345803507|5.0|Book not in the best condition but very readable.  It was well read!  Haha!!  It's just bent open and won't clse but no biggie.  I will fix it,  cover in good condition.
0451205766|5.0|For even modest fans of the movie, the level of detail and planning that goes into this novel is extremely rewarding. It is extremely in-depth in the best way. Even minor characters such as Luca, Johnny + Nino, Al and, to a degree, Clemenza and Tessio. All of these secondary characters really come into their own in a way the movie can't begin to touch.<br /><br />The main trio of Don Vito, Tom Hagen, and Michael is incredible. I had doubts that the book could be better than the movie in this regard but most of the good dialogue was taken word for word from here. And they missed quite a bit of good stuff just because of time constraints.<br /><br />The structure of the whole Family is (finally) revealed and it is logical and brutal. The actual writing is very good, if a bit heavy-handed and overly macho, but it definitely works on every level. This covers the entirety of \\"The Godfather\\" movie + the flashback scenes of young Vito and extra scenes. Also, Kay is handled more delicately and frankly far better than the movie. Her comparison with Vito's wife shows how she can love and hate Michael realistically.<br /><br />Probably the only downfall is the unnecessarily lewd sexual content with Sonny, Johnny, and Lucy, but eh, that's the times.<br /><br />For fans of the movie, this is a no brainer. For everyone else, it's a must read.<br /><br />The hardcover's paper is fairly light and the print varies in thickness, but other than that it's a simple, clean design with a nice dust jacket.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|Super CD here bought others and really love the songs and some of the videos that they have.worth buying Bigtime
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. I don't want to give anything away, because the journey is part of what makes this such a breathtaking piece of writing.  It is as good as it sounds, I promise.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Arrow, much like current super hero movies, takes the source material seriously while still having a good time.  The first few episodes are a little rough as the show tries to figure itself out.  Ultimately this show was very enjoyable and leaves you ready for the next season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great upgrades, power-ups, stages, and the graphics all are great quality. Great value! Deserves a bit of your time! :)
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Love Kelly even more than when she won idol..that was the start of a great Career for her and soon husband
B001JNNDGA|4.0|although this may sound trite, but i may have rated it 5 stars if mel gibson was not involved. loved the historic feel to the movie, and have watched it several times, it is fascinating.
B009K72G8I|5.0|I found the first two seasons of this show a little difficult to get through, but by season 5 I feel the show really figured out how what types of stories work in this format.  My only complaint: there isn't a season 6.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If you want the truth about where our food comes from, this is a &#34;must see&#34; video.<br />I strongly recommend it not only for your own healthy eating, but for the good of the planet.  Our addiction to meat is killing us, and the planet as well.  We can, and must change.
B000P2A256|5.0|Best made CD one of the best cds out there and really like Adam Levine so made me want to buy
B00DPH7Q0W|5.0|it is always fascinating to here the artists take on their work. in this case exceptionally so due to the iconic status of one of rock musics greatest albums. would wholeheartedly recommend this video to everyone!
B005FDWM6M|4.0|A Little Princess not only placed me back into the time of World War One, America, and India, but showed me what it was like to be a little girl then (poor and wealthy). I loved every minute of it and don't see how it could ever get old. If I have a daughter I plan on showing her it.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I loved this show.  This is one of those that comes out of nowhere and grabs your attention immediately.  Unfortunately I can't get it on Amazon Prime yet to enjoy it again and again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Grips you from the beginning to the end in a tight hug of emotions!  Keeps you pleading for more page after page!
0061124958|5.0|I liked it as a kid and my son likes it too! It is a classic children's book that should be in everyone's library.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is very addicting and creative! I love how you have to think and then rethink! the only dislike I have is it has to reload every five or so games..but its ok for me..!:)
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Thought the whole theme on judgement on the spot was interesting. Just glad that is not what takes place.
B00992CF6W|4.0|horrible.........................................just kidding its cool if they would add enchanting in next update plz mojang i fan and get blocklauncher pro or the free one bye
0142406112|4.0|What YA reader could not love a teenage James Bond? Stormbreaker introduces middle grade and YA readers to Alex Rider who is recruited to be a spy after his uncle and guardian is killed just before he was going to bring down an powerful group of business men who are going to use schools to spread their evil. Complete with super cool spy gadgets and tools, Alex is sent undercover to one of the schools to find out what the Business group is up to. Luckily, Anthony Horowitz does not take the story too seriously because it is pretty implausible, but it is so much fun that no reader is going to complain. Stormbreaker is a story with no serious themes, historical connections, or insight just lots of excitement and humor. The perfect choice for the most relucant reader. Luckily, there are severl sequels to Stormbreaker to keep those reluctant readers going for a while.
0596009208|5.0|Very helpfull for beginners, the examples are good to understand all the new things that java wants It s a good buy
B00EPVK5SM|5.0|I was flying home from Edinburgh Scotland and the plane had a music library. I randomly selected the Stereophonics and listened to this cd twice. Excellent.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|this is a great little puzzle game, it is quite simple, yet challenging all at the same time.my wife really enjoyed this app. For all the people that are complaining that you cannot erase the lines once you start in the regular game mode, well you're just going to have to deal with that you want the game to have some challenge right?that's one of the problems in this modern era, everybody wants their game genie, or dare game shark, or way to make a simple challenging game like this one, even easier by being able to erase an undo what you've done that would sort of destroy all challenges that this game has to offer.<br /><br />I for one am very pleased with this app and the developer in general. I wish people would stop giving these developers such a hard time. Just because this game is offered free on a children me website does not mean that he did not spend a lot of time to port the Android app version of it. It's kind of insulting when you tell somebody that they're hard work isn't worth anything. Don't you agree? I mean how would you like it if someone came into your job and said you know I don't think you should get paid for what you are doing. Did anyone ever stop to think that maybe the developer was getting perks from the cool math site and getting paid buy them from the advertising. So before you start judging app sayin' they're not worth anything just remember how would you like it if someone did that to you. Good job developer keep up the good work :-)<br />I have one final thought, why don't you download the Android SDK development kitt<br /><br />I
B00BUI5GW8|3.0|Not as bad as people have said I like a few songs on the album he need to keep doing his thing
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|Great movie with a ton of heart:)  Great actors, great story and great music!!!  Had to get the three disc combo with the DIgital Copy so I can have it on my iPhone & iPad.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked this book.  I think I knew what was going on very quickly though.  It was a good read and I'd recommend it.  I just found it to be easy to guess what was going on.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Cassandra Clare is an excellent author.  I really enjoyed this series and was excited to learn that she was writing a prequel series also.
B003JQLHY0|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Seiko is old brand, one of the best. As for the pricing policy - thanks to them! They make swiss best quality mechanic watch available to people. The Swiss do not practice that much anymore.
B00D3NSDVO|3.0|Ripping yarn but don't think about the plot too much as credibility is stretched to breaking point. I enjoyed it.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I think I liked this one almost as much as the first one.  I would recommend as an easy read.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|I've seen semi-zany Indian films since the 60's, at least this was better than most. The only way this thing could win an Oscar was with the sympathy vote
B004QMW1NM|5.0|In my estimation, one of the best bands making music right now.  The Naked and Famous aren't one hit wonders, so anyone who only buys the singles is missing out on some great deep cuts!
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Beatrix Potter created Peter Rabbit and countless other children's classics.  This is her own story, the story of a talented and determined young woman, who overcomes seemingly impossible odds to achieve literary and financial success and in the bargain finds true love.  True, she suffers a tragic loss, but in the end, she is triumphant and happy.  I recommend this beautiful film to anyone interested in biography, romance, or girl power.
B006WWU8IO|5.0|She just sings about everyday events that most people go through.  I think Taylor's songs will be ones that people continue to sing a long time.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Not only did Day-Lewis look exactly like Lincoln, he had the mannerisms, and Midwest twang I would have imagined Lincoln to have! Super movie
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I never want to put a Harlan Coben book down once I start and this was no exception.  My new favorite.
1433503808|5.0|For buying a bible this is the first ever one I have bought. When I was looking I wanted something that would give me more information if I wanted it to. I saw the ESV Study Bible, and after reading most reviews it seemed like it was the best choice. It has a lot of other information in it included, so the bible it's self is bigger and heavier than most other bibles I have seen.<br /><br />If anything the only downside to it, and I knew before I bought it. The word of Christ is not printed in red. There is nothing there to make it stand out or anything. Unless you would prefer to highlight it yourself or something. Other than that I have very much enjoyed the ESV Study Bible.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first heard about this book because the movie was being filmed in Pittsburgh.  I saw the movie and decided to read the book afterwards.  All I can say is, I'm glad I bought it.  I will continue reading this over the years.  It is just a great coming of age book.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This app is not only based on the hub show,  but also based on the sold toys. I have been collecting,  and I have 700 something LPS toys since I was real lil--- that wasn't counting the stuffed animals, books,  and mainly-- THIS APP. Its for any age and sure for fun! :)
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's okay But not as good as the real one. If you played the real  version you adventure in a real map that's endless and mine in dungeons. I n this version there's not a big land scape you can't really mine you have to dig a lot for iron and gold. if you're new to minecraft you should play this and later get the real version for Pc.<br />NO
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE FLAPPER GIRLS WITH FRINGES & BEADS, DANCING & HAVING GOOD TIMES MOSTLY
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I first heard about this book on TV, it is currently being filmed in Pittsburgh.  So I decided to check it out, plus it was a recommend from a friend.  I'm not the whole way through it yet, but I love it already.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you have a few spare seconds to play a game, this game is for you! each game really only takes less than a minute to play, but watch out, you keep getting a new game to play and it is very hard to stop!  very fun and more challenging at each level.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Born This Way is an odd record that blends elements of dance music, gothic pop, arena rock, and even a touch of metal but never fully inhabits any of those genres. It's Lady Gaga's way of announcing she was born to be a loud, garish, genre-bending machine, and her Little Monsters were (hopefully) born to ride beside her. Where image means as much as sound, the purposely tacky cover art confirms this statement. She's neither as Bruce Springsteen nor as Whitney Houston as she may claim to be, but she's certainly a unique pop personality who nearly converts appropriation into originality. Could another modern pop star give us an album where feel-good anthems like \\"The Edge of Glory\\" and \\"Hair\\" sit nicely among weird club forays like \\"Scheisse\\" and \\"Government Hooker?\\" Although the standard edition clocks in at just over an hour, barely longer than The Fame, it feels much longer, because this is a record that is defined by its relentlessness. In an era where hype means more than music, Born This Way is still one of the most interesting albums, and Lady Gaga continues to grow more interesting as she inhabits fame.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This is a great album from start to finish.  I don't usually write reviews but I must for this one as it is my duty to tell the world that their is still great and creative music being made.  The album is so well produced that you would be doing a disservice to your self if you don't purchase the entire album.  There are 16 beautiful songs and 3 interludes that cohesively come together to truly become one.  We are so conditioned now to only buy one or two songs off the album because the rest is garbage. Finally someone is putting in work for the art instead of the money.<br /><br /> I don't work for Janelle Monae or Bad Boy( I don't even like Diddy like that) but I do want to let everyone know that Electric Lady is worth it.  Support good music people.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I just like Lady Antebellum.  They're just good.  They don't disappoint either on any of their titles, they're all ones that you walk away singing even after the song is over.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Free, easy to learn, customizable, and syncs to all platforms...hands down the best of its kind. If you're looking for a to-do list w/multiple lists, reminders, and the option to upgrade for sharing options, look no further.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I just finished a two week vacation and read the first three in the Gabriel Allon series. Loved them all!
B0000028UK|5.0|a must have in every Pearl Jam collection thank you for auto rip I love it I don't have to do it myself.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I first heard &#34;if I Die Young&#34; on the radio coming home from work one day.  I don't think I could ever get sick of it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like the rod that bends out to use for serrated knives does an excellent job and even for sharp knives just a few passes and you will have a razor blade sharpened knife. I only paid 6 something though so look around to find best price.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I really like this so far but I haven't yet figured out how to delete photos after they go up to the cloud!!!
B000669GAI|5.0|this is music! love auto rip saves me from having to do it cd I needed again I love you Amazon.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I think this movie is hilarious.  I've watched it multiple times, and each time I laugh harder.  I wish they hadn't put the awkward threesome shot in there, it could have done without that.  But other then that, I'd recommend it.
B000B589JI|1.0|This product says on the back of the packaging &#34;Manufactured To Zippo Quality Standards in China&#34;. Zippo should be sorely ashamed of putting their name on this product as is has a major manufacturing defect right out of the packaging. Mine leaked Fuel badly. Either the threads are not cut far enough down the main body or the rubber gasket is to thin, resulting in the lower body never engages the ruber gasket in the middle lid portion and making a proper seal.
B009POCG2C|5.0|And another great baseball story!  I love the father/daughter relationship.  I really liked the way the story ended!  Keep up the good work.
B000002GJH|5.0|CD a must have if you love Pearl Jam or Sound garden. I remember when I first heard this so long ago.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|She just sings about everyday events that most people go through.  I think Taylor's songs will be ones that people continue to sing a long time.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|No matter what season or show.... They ALL make me laugh. Hope to get the whole collection. Oh oh yeah
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I loved this show.  First time I was ever devoted to a show. Loved Logan and Veronica, loved Mac.  Just a great, well written, REAL show. So sad it never got it's chance.  I vowed this would be the last show I ever watched on the CW and I'm still going strong.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This one of the reasons I got the movie. I love Eddie Vedder's voice and he does the movie justice.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love it! Play it every day. Lots of different ways to play. Worth paying for the upgrade. So much fun!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show always makes me laugh. Anytime I feel down in the dumps I watch this show. Its is sooooo darn funny
B008035H16|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book, and it honestly was one of the best books I've ever read. I loved reading about Zappos' story and loved even more the deeper messages within the book.
B000025QLX|5.0|CD lost can be found again at a cheap price. I enjoy getting back the CD I've lost I will slowly get them all again.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Best show ever. If you have never seen it before you will enjoy every episode and every season from start to finish.
B000W91RUG|5.0|If you like this show then you just have to buy them all. Makes you laugh out loud that is for sure. And the guys are just so darn cute.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|It keeps you interested but it kept making me mad... until the very end. I wouldn't read another like it.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Must have for all Pearl Jam fans I owned on Vinyl but know way to listen to them anymore. I bought  CD
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids really enjoy this game. The minions are cute. It is easy enough for my youngest but entertaining enough for the older one.
B00471TLZS|5.0|My son (10) was asking for a scary movie to watch this past Friday the 13th, so I chose this one.  It scared him and his friends pretty good!!  Brings back memories. It scared me at that age, I see it still works!  Fun times!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game<br />I plan on continuing to play. Reminds me of the old Atari game. Five stars! Keep up the good work. Twenty words yet?
B000002HJD|5.0|The CD is great but no download with it I like the auto rip then I don't have to do it myself.
0143039482|2.0|I know it is looked down upon when a \\"classic\\" novel gets a less-than stellar review, but it is appropriate in this case.<br /><br />Steinbeck's last book is extremely disappointing, mainly because of its unbearably slow pace. The story of a man who veers away from his stringent moral code is a strong premise. However, very little happens in the book. The narrative is plagued by the main character's irrelevant musings and the odd shifts in POV. I struggled to finish the book, especially the last 90 pages, and there is no real payoff.<br /><br />Steinbeck certainly has the talent (Of Mice and Men is amazing) but good writing is only part of the formula for a good book. It should also have some element of entertainment. Sadly, this book is flat out boring.<br /><br />It is a shame that Steinbeck did not end his career with a better book.<br /><br />Steven Donahue was a copywriter for TV Guide magazine for 14 years. His first novel, Amanda Rio, was published in 2004. It has received critical acclaim from reviewers for Amazon.com and thebestreviews.com. Steven currently resides in Bucks County, PA with his wife, Dawn. He has two new novels that were released in 2013: The Manila Strangler (Rainstorm Press) and Amy the Astronaut and the Flight for Freedom (Hydra Publications).
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I can't imagine why this series didn't last longer. The stories are diverse and the characters developed and growing with each episode. A shame it didn't last longer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story and the relationship within the story are engaging.  Each episode leaves you wanting to watch &#34;just one more&#34;.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|this is my favorite cd from Pearl Jam I of course had to get it again. I lost all of my cd I'm slowly getting them back.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love being able to use the AccuWeather in the early morning right after I turn the alarm off.  It's nice to be able  to dress for the appropriate weather.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is an enjoyable show.  Smart and funny. And since it is free on Amazon, what do you have to lose?
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is an awesome book that everyone should read. Hopefully others will also find answers and life changing experiences within its pages.  So well with it!!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I love Eddie Vedder and this is such a great CD. I wish I would have known about before and went to the shows.
B00BGZ8TVA|2.0|I was disappointed in the movie Life of Pi.<br />Thought the movie didn't have a clear and concise message.<br />Very boring.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book. Was easy to read and to follow all the side plots. His secret was kind of sad and not at all what I expected. That was good as some books I have read I was able to figure out the end before finishing the book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome, very addictive! It is very hard to put down. This is worth having in your collection. Good luck and have fun!
B002IVLH60|5.0|Get back some CD's I've lost a couple of years ago. I love PJ and I'm glad I can buy them and get the download too.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I have been waiting since March to buy this cd. I was going to buy a physical cd but couldn't wait for the delivery. I was trying to buy it on iTunes but silly iTunes wouldn't take my card. Thanks for backing me up Amazon! I love this cd!
B007SGM084|5.0|Great character development. I completely fell in love with Mr. Grey and enjoyed the way these two characters fell in love for the first time.
B005TKD6NY|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book , definitely Murakami's best ! I liked the plot and the characters . Murakami really knows how to get you in his world where unexpected thing happen . One of my favorites !
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Sad but great. I loved the soundtrack for the music. I enjoyed the beautiful filmed movie I just wish it had a different ending.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|The crew members, the battle against the Wraith......I love SY FY! Wormholes to other galaxies will soon be discovered if not already so. The possibilities excite me...that's why I love this show.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show keep you guessing and intrigue, u get a chance to know n love all the characters.its must watch.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Still reading it ...unbelievable that is all i can say ... Don't even bother watching a movie when you can read this wonderful book ! Suzanne Collins made a story that will definitely swipe you of your feet !
B005N09L5C|4.0|Depressing movie but interesting. Shows how government without control of the people will strip all freedoms away. Keep in mind this is a fiction movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|HAVEN'T PLAYED FOR VERY LONG, BUT SO FAR SO GOOD. I LOVE PREHISTORIC PARK GAME. THEY GIVE YOU LOTS OF CASH TO BUY STUFF.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would and have recommended this to others.  I thought it had great characters and produced very well. I didn't want it to end and actually have watched some of the episodes again. The setting is spectacular and the mansion is incrediable.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I love love love love this game &lt;3 I play it on cool math but now that it's on the amazon app store I am I. Heaven ! (: I love this game &amp; I'm so glad it's free today &lt;3 Thanks amazon ^.^
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Fun and entertaining.  For families, there is a short sexy scene in the very beginning where you might want to cover your kids eyes, otherwise have fun.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought that there was much depth to the subject and wonderful development of the characters. Although the subject is very sad it is ever current and eased by the humaneness of the main characters. There is no final answer in the end, just what happens in this book.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Hilarious I love Jess - & Nick he's such a girls kind of guy! Can't wait for the new season this wk!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very cool and fun I've only been playing for a short time but really like it so far
B00CMQX84A|4.0|She can't get enough of this movie. It's great for kids of all ages. There's not even a kissing scene in it!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is great.  I spend alot of time traveling.  The Edjing Free DJ mic rec studio is great for passing the time even if your not a DJ and just love music.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Good, but a little predictable. Jeff Bridges was really good as the villain. Did not think the &#34;DUDE&#34; could be a bad guy that was believable, but he was great!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|started a little slow but i couldnt put down once the story took hold. th ending qoute is thought provoking and relavant to everyones life.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Not one of my favorites, went a little slow at first, maybe it was just me, because I know several other people enjoyed it very much.
156224003X|4.0|I am so happy that this book arrived so that I can participate in class. It not due to the carrier the my personal mailing system.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|As many TV shows. The network never gave this one a chance. Now I see why creator Joss  was upset with the networks. Great show and cast.
B007NZDES0|5.0|You can feel the very best of SADE.<br />This one is a great gift to the fan of SADE and the best guide to new fans.<br />Concerts are so nicely organized that  I feel this could be the last..
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Awesome book!  Hard to put down.  Baldacci does a great job describing the characters and peeks your interest very early in the book.
B003I64748|5.0|This record of Aguilera is nothing like her other ones. It's multi-sound and sharing lots of experiences from the start till the end and it's why I love it. The package was super-protective for the triple vinyl, which safely was delivered to me.<br />I strongly recommend this for lovers of quality pop music and records.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great as advertised. Plug it in and start watching Netflix, YouTube and listen to Google play music today. Buy two.
B008JFUO36|2.0|I missed Oblivion in the theaters so today I got a RedBox rental. According to what I've read, and the rental dvd menu, there are special features… but none of the three versions sold at Amazon list anything at all!<br />I sometimes find the extras to be the best part of a movie purchase and &#34;Oblivion&#34; would be one of those for me.<br /><br />Visually interesting but with endless plot holes such as contamination concerns (but you never saw Cruise taking any precautions- except an ordinary shower when he got home). What's to be concerned about? Earth was destroyed but various structure still stand, maybe buried under a LOT of soil, but standing- yeah, right.<br /><br />I think I figure out the alien angle before it was revealed, stupid aliens usually did a sloppy job of tracking Cruise- almost laughable.<br /><br />I may buy a copy someday, there is a visual appeal if you check your brain at the door, but I'll need some of those extras I've heard about and I don't see them here.
1619691809|5.0|I really like this author and this character in particular!  Once started, must finish it the same day!  Thank you!
B004SRWW0C|5.0|This is a great app with great features.  i use it a lot with my rooted phone.  got frustrated because the app was never updated on Amazon.  Ended up buying it on the play store.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|He has a way of putting you there.  He tells both sides of the story.  Always enjoy his books. would like a little more history
B008S4FZHI|2.0|I have read all the Scarpetta novels but the last few have not been up to standard. This last one has made me decide that I have had enought, it was actually boring to read. I would advice fewer new books and more effort to be innovative, otherwise Scarpetta could loose her fans
B00866H7SS|4.0|Enjoyable, light reading, but it hasn't made me race to read book 2 yet.  A good light read for time out.
B008469DGY|5.0|I noticed that Sun beam that refracted as the camera panned to the left.  And the play is really fun.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It is a really fun and entertaining use of my time. It does however periodically tell me it cannot connect to the server which is really frustrating.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I always like Nelson DeMille's books, this is a good one too.  John Corey makes me laugh - its not a disappointment
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I am a Trekie from way back.  This is a movie that you can watch over and over again and still enjoy.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I bought this to go with my Baby Jogger City Mini GT double stroller. I was seriously upset that the coordinating stroller console sold by Baby Jogger costs nearly $30. The price was right on this one. I take walks for about an hour every day with my babies, and this holds my water bottle, keys, garage door opener, phone, and has room to spare. I keep pepper spray and sometimes money in the zippered pouch, where these items remain out of sight. I would say 4 stars instead of 5 because it can slip around a bit on the stroller (again, this is a double stroller so this item isn't &#34;custom-made&#34; for it) and it takes some messing with the straps (but not much) to get it at the right height to fit the water bottle in without it being blocked by the stroller handle. Again, the price is right on and I find this useful.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Realistic app that remembers the weapons that shaped WWII.  Easy to learn with quick tutorials for each item and plenty of options.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I thought the structure of the novel was interesting; whereby the author wove a long family and old Arab fairy tale together to culminate into the end of the novel.  Perhaps, at times, it ran too slowly to hold my interest.  Overall a fair book.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My nephews enjoy playing this game every time they visit me. They are 2&amp;4 yrs old. I also play to help them out with tasks.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|This album is great! I've listened to it everyday since I got it! Her voice and the accompaniment just flow so well together. Just wonderful!
B00821OX98|5.0|really surprised by this series, cast, storylines , special effects have been very good. The main &#34;family&#34; is heavy at times , would like to see other characters get more background focus/story. But has kept me interested.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I enjoyed being captured and captivated by this world view and enjoyed suspending belief in what is possible.  Wonderful read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A dramatic end to this trilogy.  So many twists and turns in the plot and great character development.  Hated to see it end.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Rook is a fella who never gives up.  I love his character and the spice of Nikki Heat together.  This is really entertaining.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|For students of WWII and Hitler's unfathomable cruelty...this is a touching story. I understand this book is now going to become a movie. Done right, no dry eyes. Really a good story.
B005VSRFEA|4.0|The lesson and message of this book is simple, complex and very reminiscent of Socratic method.  Ask questions, seek answers, never be satisfied until you can prove an accurate picture of the universe.  Socrates would say that is impossible for man and so does the author.  Upon completion, I feel sad, but also elated and hopeful.  It is a shame to lose a wise and insightful student of the universe, but am grateful that her contemporaries were moved to publish her life's work.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Was enjoying the storyline until the abrupt ending. It was then that I realized this was a Harry Potter want to be
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|How bad can a film with Gemma Arterton be? Modern language kinda spoils the period setting. And maybe somebody can explain the physics of a fully automatic bow to me.
0452270073|5.0|I wonder if anyone really learns from the past? I guess history will always repeat itself. War sucks and this book leaves much to ponder.
B00CTT9646|5.0|this is not what I thought I was going to get. I thought just a miniature but it is lifesize and a mix of metal and plastic. this thing is gorgeous
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Well written, well acted, good story. Does not play out as a Tom Cruise piece but rather as a nicely crafted drama with a twist.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|With this cast it was such a big disappointment!  Danny McBrides worst film EVER.  The comedy missed with every line and was a huge waste of time!  Don't Bother!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Witty, often humorous, and heartwarming all the way!  The cast of characters are perfect!  I am anxiously awaiting season four!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This id great when spelling doesn't look right I can check it for myself. It is also great if you are a scrabble or words with friends player allows you to find words and challenge words easily. Also good when the kids do vocabulary homework on the run, no waiting to we get home to look up definitions.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|Some part inside of me wants to let the spiders eat the bugs. I personally dislike the art style, and find the sounds and actions the pathetic bugs make hideous. The strategy is quite good though, but once again, I just can't get over that disgusting art. Not cute, not loveable and very annoying. (Feels like angry birds in terms of polish, also not good.)
B001NA2NM4|5.0|A timeless masterpiece of deceit, ridicule, betrayal, and vengence.  It's a bit like an extended episode of the Twilight Zone-but much-much earlier.  I'd love to say more, but it would risk spoiling the ending.  Way ahead of it's time in terms of cinematography, stunts, etc.  The viewer must keep in mind that this film was released in 1932 on the heels of silent film and movie-making with spoken word and soundtrack was still in it's infancy. \\"Freaks\\" is freakishly-unique.  An original of it's kind. An absolute classic and must-see for fans of the \\"horror\\" genre! . Some scenes may be considered of questionable content, in-particular to those who are among the pre-offended percentile of today's politically-correct community.  Highly recommended!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Great show! Great season. Disks in great condition! This was one of my best purchases! I love it! Great buy!
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I love this series, which i would say is my all time favorite fantasy saga but this may be my least favorite book of the 14 book series  It was good, just not the great ending I was hoping for.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I dare you to pick this book up and try to put it down! I love the way Deborah decribes scenes, pleasures and feelings. The history aspect I really like. This is one book to read twice!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Five star!  A great work about a great band that has produced some if the most intelligent yet amazingly enduring music.  This film is simply excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I adore this game. I laugh and have such a good time playing it. I could spend hours just on this game!
1400069289|1.0|Book Review. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.<br /><br />The author is a New York Times investigative reporter. The book boasts of endorsements from FT, WSJ and NYT. It's a huge hit. Its overall rank for books in Amazon is 182. It's #2 under the Business & Investing category, #5 under Health, and #17 under religion. It boasts of nearly 1,300 reviews, out of which 1,000-plus are 5-star and 4-star reviews.<br />So the public likes it, and the critics have been wowed. What more can I add to it, except to say that it's a totally stupid book. I didn't like it in the first read. So I decided there must be something wrong with my tastes, and read it again. Still no luck. Then I flipped through it a third time to find out whether I can pick up anything useful, to salvage something out of the INR 600 I spent. Again, I came a cropper.<br />The book is nothing more than a repackaging of the discredited Behavioral Psychology of John B. Watson, B F Skinner, et al. What Duhigg refers to as 'Habit' is 'Behavior', according to behaviorists. What he refers to as 'Cue' in cute little diagrams given throughout the book are what behaviorists referred to as 'Stimulus'. And when Duhigg says 'Routine', we should think 'Response' in the language of the behaviorists.<br />Besides the neat little diagrams referred to above, the book is filled with trite observations throughout.<br />Here are a few:<br />\\"When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.\\" Got it?<br />And, \\"Once you break a habit into its components, you can fiddle with the gears.\\"<br />The book begins with the classic feint of Psychologists. Since Psychology itself is a semi-quack science, its practitioners are determined to secure their credentials as scientists. Hence lots of Psychology books borrow plenty of material on brain science from an established science like Neuroscience. Then they begin their shtick. Duhigg understands this at some level. He must have researched lots of best-selling Social Psychology books. So he begins with the story of a patient who suffered memory loss, and after talking at length about indisputable facts culled from the research of Neuroscientists, segues into his Cue--Routine--Reward quack science. Well done buddy!<br />All this can be forgiven. But where I take serious objection to is Duhigg's unwanted foray into analyzing the Montgomery Bus Boycott movement. This is one the storied events in the history of the US Civil Rights Movement which secured the credentials of Dr. Martin Luther King. How would you like it, when this peddler of discredited quackery tries to interpret its success in part to Dr. King's emphasis on Social Habits? Duhigg, in fact, has talked to respected Civil Rights historian Taylor Branch. I suspect he has attempted to twist the historian's words to fit his narrative.<br />In summary, it would be remiss of me if I didn't borrow the words of Dorothy Parker, used while reviewing a novel by Benito Mussolini, to describe The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. \\"This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.\\"
B005721W9O|4.0|Good Movie, very entertaining sci-fi comedy. My 14 year old son, who is a big Monk fan, wished there had been more of Tony Shalhoub, but other than that no comp[laints. I hope the rumors of a galaxy quest 2 come true!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun game, although the replay value is pretty low as far as I'm concerned.<br />Most of the levels have one basic way to beat them, and that doesn't change the second time around.<br />Get's you thinking and planning moves ahead.<br />Easy to put down and come back to later without being lost.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a great book.  Very engaging and the two different perspectives was very enjoyable. I would recommend it for sure.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The large amount of action scenes are great and really help keep my attention.  This is the kind of book that I can sit down to and read all day and all night!
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|My 5 year old loved it. It's pretty simple  in my opinion but whatever, he's happy so it served it's purpose.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  There is a great mix of action and the infamous love stories that girls tend to adore.  I also love seeing Clary grow and start coming into her own.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Love Clint Eastwood. Amy Adams is great as well. I would recommend this. I highly recommend this movie. Fast delivery too.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|At first I didn't get it, but then it got good. Like it.<br />Good for most ages, a good match 3 game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a Wii and a PS3 in the living room, so I don't really need a Chromecast for my TV. I use this little thing exclusively on my micro projector in the bedroom. I wanted to watch Netflix and stuff on the bed at night. It works perfectly! No hiccups, no nothing.<br /><br />I can't wait to see Chromecast out of beta and truly shine with bunch of supported apps, including the Amazon prime video app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book. Could hardly put it down!! Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer with great imagination. Love it!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Good amount of things to do without having to require real money to pay for it.  Does need more ways to earn peanuts.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|My daughter read this book and said she was sad to see it end! She is 15, that says volumes!
0385343248|5.0|Shogun.  My son read this one in another facility and told me it was very good.<br />The books I have rated have been read by me or my son.  If you'll look at your records many of the books were returned to you as undeliverable because those ordered to go to William got there after he had been sent to a different correctional facility and the CA Department of Corrections does not forward if the mail is received after the person has been moved.  As soon as he gets to a regular facility for the next 3 years,  I'll be reording some of these sane biooks if they are available in paperback.<br /><br />I have a question  -- Do any of the book come in the Spanish llanguarge ?  If so is there different way to view those available in Spanish.
1439156816|5.0|This book is one of King's best. Not only for aspiring writers, but for anyone who wants an enjoyable read. It is as if you are having coffee with a good friend, at the kitchen table, discussing the art of living and writing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I would highly recommend this show because the premise keeps you hooked. The characters are all interesting and the music is really good. Get ready to be totally entertained.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game, lots of puzzles to solve. I play on my kindle fire and on my iphone. There should be more games like this.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I always prefer to read the book before seeing the movie.  It's an interesting story line.  Waiting to start the 2nd book until the 2nd movie gets closer.  A lot of similarities to Harry Potter.  Not so much the story, but the idea that non magical people are mundanes/muggles.  Even having the word start with an M.  That was a little irritating, but other than that, it was good.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I get sucked into watching two or three episodes when I planned to watch only one. Good mix of storylines. I enjoy the mix of guest stars as well.
0393343405|5.0|I haven't finished this book yet, so this review is incomplete but so far it is absolutely riveting.  For anyone who reads at all, this is a must.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Awesome sound on this DVD audio disc.  I play it in my car on my Lexicon system, and it is amazing!  I cannot tell you how good it sounds. I think the CD is good also, but the DVD audio disc is unreal.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The tracks are so fun and change the more you play and I love how you go to El Machiavelli lair, take a run around Grus neighborhood,  smash down other minions in the Laboratory or enjoy a day at the beach...its all good. My only con on this game is although it free if you truly get in this game they get you on the points you need for costumes, multiply your mass and more. I would rather it give you the option to convert your bananas to points instead of attempting to milk you after and before all runs...its annoying!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Finally a dragon game that is compatible with the Kindle. I was playing a different dragon game that killed my Kindle Fire every time I tried to play. The graphics in Dragon vale are cheerful and happy. Thank you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. We could (and often do) waste all our free time playing it. Love the beach update too!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Great Movie for kids and adults.  This is a keeper and one you can watch over and over again for time to come.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|My six and seven year old sons say, \\"It was supercalafragilisticexpioladocious!\\" It is a great movie for the whole family.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|An entertaining though highly formulaic and predictable plot that repeatedly shied from becoming either edgy or profound to exist in that dust covered space between
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Great futuristic fun.  Extremely violent but it is cartoon, video-game violence.  Much more entertaining than Stallone's earlier effort.  entitled &#34;Judge Dredd.&#34;
B00CL151G4|5.0|I wasn't sure about this show when it first started, but as the show progressed I like it more and more.  I am looking forward to the second season and I think I will like it just as much as the first.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I love this movie, I have watched it a few times. My 19 yr old son sat down to watch it and he got very hooked, he even had his girlfriend watch it later.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I love the parallel lives the crew encounters during the movies and the modern dramatics.  I love that Spock and Ohura have a personal relationship in both movies.  The actor who played Khan did a great job!  He also played Sherlock Holmes in a Masterpiece Mystery and was also great in that!  I certainly hope that they don't stop making the Star Trek movies, for all of these types of movies that are being made, just don't add up!!
0345803485|1.0|Reading through this book, it's obvious that this is a Twilight fanfiction as the author can barely conceal the characters of Bella and Edward in Anastasia and Christian.<br /><br />Anastasia adopts Bella's clumsiness and tact for falling down for no reason, Christian shares Edward's constant obsession on not being able to read Anastasia's mind. (He even states this in the book--why a normal human being is obsessing over not being able to read minds is more than a little blatant that the author didn't intend this role to be for a human)<br /><br />The car in which Edward saves Bella from is traded out for a cyclist that Grey pulls Ana from hitting. The amazing speed, intuition and instincts that Grey shares with Edward has been based on money-power instead of vampire powers. It even has the scene where Grey tells Anna to stay away from him and that it's dangerous to be involved with him.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the very lame replacements that this author makes in this story to not be based on Twilight, I would argue that she downright plagiarized many things from Stephanie Meyer.<br /><br />It follows the same formula as Twilight in that there is a lot of nothing but googly-eyes and pining over this Christian Grey by Anastasia. That is UNTIL, it gets to the extreme point that I would basically summarize as Anastasia signing a contract to literally be owned by Grey as a sex toy. That is where it just falls from Twilight to become just a complete porn book. The beginning half was so painfully shallow and unimaginative that I felt like it was those pornos that attempt to have a \\"story.\\"<br /><br />But here's my biggest issue with the book.<br />Christian Grey's character hits on all the points of what a controlling and really abusive man is. Don't believe me, go to any domestic abuse/sexual abuse site  and look under what abusive relationship traits are.<br /><br />The fact that the author painted these behaviors and traits as \\"sexy\\" and \\"fantasy-worthy\\" is scary. The female main character, Anastasia Steele, is no better for desiring this type of \\"relationship.\\" His \\"dark secret\\" that is being talked about is even more reason to believe this guy needs help badly.<br /><br />This author needs some serious mental help if she's believing that this type of relationship is something to fantasize about. I've been in one bad relationship where the guy had control traits (not as extreme as Grey), and it is anything but a fairytale, it's a nightmare. Why the word romance is even associated with this book is false advertisement. There is no love felt by these characters. It's porn, simple lust.<br /><br />Probably the most sad part about this whole fifty shades of grey book fad is that women have begun to want to copy what is happening in the books with their own boyfriends or guys. Note ladies, don't. I hear relationships ending because girls pull this crap and scare their boys away.<br /><br />The only thing I can give this book is that it does give a clear warning of what you're getting into, with Erotica Romance labeled on its cover. (Romance being false.) The writing is solid grammar and higher vocabulary than what I'd expect.<br /><br />Overall, the downfall is how this book has blown up in popularity and being praised as a great book when its not. It's just plain porn writing.<br />And instead of being in the small erotica section in the bookstore that people shyly visit, its paraded around on the front shelves. Something vulgar and trashy as this stuff just shows how far our culture has fallen to what is considered, \\" a good story.\\"<br /><br />BTW, don't take the amazon star rating for this book too seriously. Most of the 'reviews' for this are people who rate it five stars without reading the book, or they're grammar/punctuation are so bad that I can't read them. Take that for what you will.The female main character, Anastasia Steele, is no better for desiring this type of \\"relationship.\\" His \\"dark secret\\" that is being talked about is even more reason to believe this guy needs help badly.<br /><br />This author needs some serious mental help if she's believing that this type of relationship is something to fantasize about.

B00915G6MG|5.0|What can I say, I am an NCIS addict!  When ever the most dramatic things have happened and you just can't believe that the show can go on or make it without someone, somehow it does and it gets better!  I love the Tenth Season and I know I will love the Eleventh Season too.  We will just have to see how it goes without Zeva.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This was a present for my mom. It did not have all the songs from the tv show, but she still loved it.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|If you like crime dramas with a twist at the end you will like this one. It's a typical FBI chasing the bad guys type of movie but with an ending you might not see coming.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Typical of this author.<br />Fine detail and a sense of the time. I wonder if he gets to hospital? I enjoyed it.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|3D was very good. J.J. Abrams brings new life to an old series. Brings to life the risk taking, rule breaking Kirk. I hope there will be more movies in the near future.
0143122916|5.0|Exposed the reality of life in the worst of the third world.  There is a  revelation of the mindset inflicted on the prisoners of the absolute need to snitch on all your neighbors and enslave your soul to the system and its leaders, for survival.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is very well done.  A story of perserverence, dedication, and love.  The writer puts you right in the middle of Adam Brown's life.
B009EE6OGW|5.0|Still one of the best horror films ever. It's even better in HD. I saw it when I was 12 the first time and scared the you-know-what out of me. Seeing it in HD, still got my heart pounding and palms sweating. Excellent!
B004KPX4W2|3.0|I had heard the hype, but didn't live up to it for me. More of the same from BW. Even my husband wasn't impressed and he loves action movies.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I was really not a Star Trek fan for many years.  My wife selected nights of viewing the old Trek and I did get easily bribed into watching. You know dinner and clothes washed. Then the new works came out.  I could not help but get enthralled with the concept and updated scripts and uses of outstanding animation work.<br />I have enjoyed every actor that plays in this movie....They could make 50 more trek movies with these actors and I would be sure to watch every one.<br />Outstanding job on the Hollywood front.  You folks picked the totally correct actors/actresses. Thank you.  View and enjoy. The wife and I have already watched it 3 times

B0074MZSWW|5.0|I tuned into Alabama Shakes from their rocking track \\"Always Alright\\" on the [[ASIN:B009J2VQSK Silver Linings Playbook (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]] CD.  This CD opens with the addictive \\"Hold On\\" with its positive feel about overcoming adversity, \\"So bless my heart, bless my mind, I got so much to do, I ain't got much time.\\"  \\"I Found You\\" also pops with a retro sound based in a roots rock mold, \\"I remember all them days I waited so patiently until God brought someone who's gonna be good to me, and he blessed my soul.\\"  As a singer, Brittany Howard pulses huge amounts of emotion into her songs like \\"Heartbreaker.\\"  \\"Be Mine\\" is another riveting track with the band giving Howard a punchy backdrop on which she laces her vocals, \\"All them ladies don't know you like I do, that's why I call you my baby.\\"  All tracks are strong including \\"Rise to the Sun\\" & the final two tracks \\"I Ain't the Same\\" & \\"On Your Way.\\"  This is a band can blow the roof off the house.  Don't miss it!  Enjoy!

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie's new CD rocks out.  The opener \\"The Next Day\\" pumps with righteous anger at religious hypocrisy, \\"Here am I not quite dying, my body left to rot on a hollow tree.\\"  \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" churns with a burning intensity as Bowie's complex lyrics zoom by, \\"From behind their tinted window stretch, gleaming like blackened sunshine, stars are never sleeping.\\"  \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" is another churning rocker with Bowie's lyrical complexity matching his edgy vocals, \\"I'm seventeen, my looks can prove it, I'm so afraid that I will lose it, I'd rather phone my ex, be pleading for some teenage sex.\\"  \\"Boss of Me\\" is another strong track with the music sounding like it should play in a detective movie and Bowie's vocals haunting, \\"You look at me & you weep for the free blue sky, I look to the stars as they flicker & float in your eyes.\\"  \\"How Does the Grass Grow\\" is another of my favorite tracks with its searing electric lead guitar and Bowie's vocal intensity unrelenting until he gets to the \\"ya ya\\" chorus that almost seems to mock the song.  \\"(You Will) Set the World On Fire\\" rocks with Bowie's lyrics referencing folk singers Joan Baez, Phil Ochs and Dave Van Ronk.  \\"The Next Day\\" is a complex set that burgeons with Bowie's unique musical vision.  Enjoy!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|great tool to make a menu plan for the week and you even get a shopping list, wish we could add and change the items a bit when they double up in recipes, though.  Tried it for a weeks meals and used the shopping list function. I thought it would be expensive, but I didn't spend any more than I normally would, so that is great. Also tried sime flavours I haven't tried before.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Michael Buble's \\"To Be Loved\\" boasts great pop nuggets.  \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\" bounces with feel-good sunshine pop, tasty hooks as Buble's vocals wrap around the lyric, \\"You said we should just be friends, well I came up with that line.\\"  \\"To Love Somebody\\" is such a gorgeous song, originally by the Bee Gees.  Buble fleshes out the melody, showing off the tune as a modern standard.  \\"Come Dance With Me\\" jumps out of the speakers with its Cuban-flavored percussion and Buble's tantalizing vocals.  This is a strong set, continuing Buble's record as a master entertainer.  Enjoy!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I have only used it a bit on my tablet, but I love it. Very versatile and easy to use.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great storytelling and weaving of plot lines that you want to reach the end of a chapter so that you can start the next!
1476712042|5.0|I loved everything about this book. I loved how there chemistry is amazing and crazy at times. They go through some crazy stuff and it is a great read through and through. Everyone should read this! :)
B00AX7PGQS|1.0|Weird visuals and meaningless scene after scene that leave you wondering what is going on is not sophistication. Contrast the fantastic visuals in a truly great film like \\"Angels In America\\", which all make sense, serve a purpose and are moving, and with lots of wonderful dialogue. This film has no dialogue to speak of - just a sequence of senseless visuals, a couple mildly interesting, but most really nonsensical. The lame attempts in this movie to get one emotionally interested were artificial and failed completely.  An ugly film that leaves a bad taste in your memory.
