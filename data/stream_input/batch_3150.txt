B00GMNQIOQ|5.0|Man of Steel is slowly becoming one of my favorite films. It's not 1978 anymore and this film even brings to light flaws i wasn't aware of ib the original film. This version has a pristine picture, a few selected images from a larger &#34;making of&#34; book, as well as interesting special features. Among them is a two minute animated &#34;75 year&#34; celebration of the character himself.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|The author shows growth in the development of his characters.  He is an able story-teller.  There is a broad array of cultures and relationships at play that are realistic and meaningful in their telling.  How difficult intercultural understanding and acceptance really are; how valuable the effort to reach out of ourselves.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  If you loved the Matrix then this is right up your ally.  I love the concept of our lives being connected.  Def must buy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am currently crying my eyes out for I just finishing this book. I have done nothing in the past three hours but read. I love this book so much it hurts.<br />I recommend that you read this amazing book.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|Wow. Just, wow. I went to see Catching Fire last night after a year and a half long wait and I can honestly say, it was 100% worth it. Please go see this movie. You will not be disappointed. The director, Francis Lawrence, did a fantastic job expanding the world of Panem while keeping true to the tone set by the first movie. The first half of the movie, the victory tour and events leading up to the Quarter Quell, may feel a little bit rushed, but all the important details are there. The arena is colossal, so much better on screen than in my mind. The music, which I paid particular attention to since I loved the first film's score, was moving and fit perfectly in every scene. For book fans, there are a few minor details left out, but the amount of content taken directly from the book is amazing. Much of the dialogue (although not all) is taken straight from the book, word-for-word. This was probably my favorite part of the whole movie. And I need not add that the casting was phenomenal (but it was). Anyway, enough babbling. In conclusion, if you are a fan of the Hunger Games in any way, shape, or form, go see this movie. If you like a thrilling adventure fraught with unexpected surprises, humorous exchanges, and scenes that move you, go see this movie.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I purchased this, along with a 15ft. hosa xlr to 3.5mm dual mono cable, to enhance the sound on my vixia r40. I did a test to compare the internal mic to the xm8500. Although the internal mic on this vidcam isn't bad, I noticed right away the xm8500 is worth it's weight in gold. I like that I can keep it chest level and still be able to pick up good audio. I tested it 5' away and couldn't hear myself talk. Keep it within a 12&#34; radius of your mouth and you're good. Tip: manual mode is your friend when using an external mic (unless you like compressed audio).

B00BAXFECK|5.0|I was prepared to give it 2 stars, or 3 at the most. While I've loved Dona Tartt's writing since her first book, \\"The Secret History,\\" by a little over half-way through this tome, I realized that I didn't really like the characters--none of the living ones, and only one of the dead ones! But, instead of pitching it, I stayed to the bitter end, only to see in the very last 100 pages or so things come together in such a way that made it clear what she was exploring--the truth of life and living--the shadow-boundaries between good and evil, the metaphysics, if you will, of destiny. I saw opening before me new possibilities for \\"seeing\\" people in my own life who have been so difficult, and who I had decided to ignore--this novel made me want to keep them closer EVEN in their faulted state, and made me more able to see my own faulted self with less judgment. I came away a richer man for having shared this study of what it means to be a human being, a thinking being that exists in a world of chance, but who knows?--perhaps Chance With Some Logical Order in it? In some way, reading this book, I was able to \\"study myself\\" as Ms. Tartt studied the human condition. She urges us to have the courage to move on in hope and humor, no matter what seem the odds, and that is always sound advice. Her writing, was fluid and profound--even in the parts leading up to my evaluation that I didn't like the characters (all of whom I did like well enough by the end)--with turns of phrase that resonated in a deep place within me. The story flowed forward and back upon itself like the tide of being that we are. I see no way to give this book less than an excellent rating, and I'm grateful for the work. I shall read parts of it again and again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love Candy Crush but for some reason I can't utilize my extra moves which has become very frustrating to say the least!!! Can someone please fix this?
B003REEPJS|4.0|I have to admit, when this album came out, I was not a huge fan. Miley seemed to be acting a little ridicoulous, but the video and song \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" were cool. \\"We Owns My Heart\\" kinda sounded like Cascada, but is that a bad thing? The cover of \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" came out great.<br /><br />She may be the daughter of Billy Ray Cyrus, which would give anyone traction in the music industry, but Miley is talented. She really does have a great voice, and she doesn't rely on heavy auto-tune to make even dance music work (or at least, she didn't here).<br /><br />This review, by the date, is clearly being posted after her recent \\"We Can't Stop\\" and \\"Bangerz\\" album. While I say to say that album is really total crap, this one is not. A lot of people have written it off, but it deserves more respect. \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" as an album could've used a little more rock, but it is a solid album. Miley showcases her vocal talent still, while being more grown up. She was still the Miley we all loved, not tweety-bird clown Miley of the new \\"Bangerz\\" era.<br /><br />There is also a deluxe version of this album that includes a full concert of songs from this album and past CD's. If you overlooked this in the past, do not like the \\"new\\" Miley, or wrote it off as ok, give it another shot. This CD is actually pretty good...
1439153663|4.0|I loved the history in this book.  All very fictional but some truth could have been therein the old south.  The ending was a bit strange , but happy/tragic endings makes for good reading.<br /><br />Barbara
B00FHAB3HW|1.0|This whole album is nearly entirely unlistenable. A bunch of fake songs of Miley acting like she's some kind of gangster, awful songs with even worse rappers on them. I don't care if this is Miley Cyrus, the next Beyoncé CD, etc., it would be garbage no matter who it was. Worse, Miley barely even sings on half the songs, either being auto-tuned or talking not singing, or \\"pretending to rap.\\" I wasn't a big fan of \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" her last solo album, but compare what it had to offer and it can come off as brilliant.<br /><br />There are also even worse attempts at basically copying Gaga, but instead of sounding fun, it just becomes off as stupid. At least when Amy Winehouse was on a lot of drugs, she still made good music. This is garbage at it's worst, and I don't know who would rate this high.<br /><br />Do not buy this; not for yourself, especially not for your kids, not for anyone.

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I have been on the fence concerning Daniel Craig as 007...I loved Pierce Brosnan in the role.  However, Daniel Craig was perfect for the flawed 007 in this movie.  I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop the entire movie.  The ending with Judi Dench was priceless (I won't give away the finale) and I was choking back tears.  This is a movie I will watch again.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I was never a fan of rap - thought it was just worthless garbage.  Then a few years ago, I heard Lose Yourself on the radio and fell in love with the tune.  At that time, not knowing the name of the song, let alone the name of the artist, I frantically went in search.  When I found out the name of the artist, I was beside myself.  How in the world could this beautiful piece of music have come from a rapper???  That was my awakening.  I began to listen to the words.  There was so much depth. I bought 8 Mile, Recovery, and now this new piece.<br /><br />At first, as with the previous cd's, I had issue with the language.  However, when you step back and realize that this is all part of the expression, it fits in; it would be lost without it.  I have cried though some of the cuts ; laughed through others (My Life Would Be So Much Better.... has become my mantra at work).  This is a beautiful work - Eminem has outdone himself.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Mathers for opening my eyes a few years ago to another world of music that I might have missed. You are an intense and talented man.<br /><br />Written by a 58 year old female - mother of 4/grandmother of 6.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|We listened to the audio book on a couple of long road trips (Craig Wasson does a terrific job narrating this amazing story). The book starts off a bit slow, but hang in there because you will soon realize you need to read (or in our case- listen) to just a bit more and a bit more and a bit more to find out what happens next, later, at the end. I think it's Stephen King's best work.

B00F1W1SHG|5.0|*Edit: Okay...I've checked back and I 5 people have not found my review helpful. I knew my review was long, but I guess it was a little too long for people to read or understand properly. As such, I've condensed this review somewhat (even taken out a couple of unnecessary ramblings) and hopefully it will be more informative and well-received than before.<br /><br />As the title of the review says, if I could give this DVD/CD 4.5 stars instead of 5, I would have. It's not perfect by any means, but it is excellent. I want to focus on three main things in this review: the band members and their performance here, the setlists on each DVD/CD, and the audio mix.<br /><br />I'll start by giving an overview of each of the current members and how I feel they performed here. I'll give each of them a rating out of 5, and I'll explain why briefly in each overview.<br /><br />John Petrucci (Guitars/Backing Vocals): Along with John Myung, John Petrucci is the only original member of Dream Theater still touring and recording with the band. It is worth mentioning that John has a guitar solo on this DVD/CD. Through his solo and in the songs, you can tell that he pours his heart and soul into every note he picks. Petrucci gets a 5/5 on this performance.<br /><br />John Myung (Bass Guitar): As already mentioned, John Myung is one of the original members of Dream Theater.  He is an absolute monster of a bass player. Some of his finger work is so fast that it literally looks sped up on some parts. Check out the 32nd notes he does on 6:00 and you'll see what I mean. Like with Petrucci, John Myung gets a 5/5 on this performance.<br /><br />James LaBrie (Lead Vocals): James has developed somewhat of a mixed reputation over the years with his voice. However, despite suffering from a major setback in 1994 and seemingly developing some bad habits over the last decade, he has come a long way and has improved noticeably over the past two years. He just needs to improve his high mid range (stilltoo nasily sounding, as you'll see during many of the songs from Images and Words/Awake that are performed here) and stick to the melody more closely and he'll be pretty much back to his old self. James gets a 3.5/5 here.<br /><br />Jordan Rudess (Keyboard Instruments): The keyboard wizard himself! Jordan is definitely your stereotypical musical prodigy.  Jordan is very technical on every instrument he plays here, from the Keyboard to the Continuum Board to his Ipad! Like John Petrucci and Mike, Jordan has a keyboard solo here, and it is very much a treat to see! Jordan gets a 4.5/5 on this performance.<br /><br />Mike Mangini (Drums): Mike Mangini is the newest member of Dream Theater. He's incredibly technical, being able to play complex polyrhythms and pretty much fly around the kit all the while keeping time very precisely. He showcases his talent throughout the songs on this performance as well as in his solo, which he does during the first half of the main show. I'm definitely glad he joined Dream Theater, and I can't wait to see what he has to offer in the coming years. Despite a few slight timing hiccups (which every drummer has), Mike gets a 4.5/5 on this DVD/CD.<br /><br />Next, I'd like to talk about the setlist on both DVDs.<br /><br />The first DVD (and the first 2 CD's) contains the full show plus encore song from one of the two nights that was taped. Being that this was the tour to promote A Dramatic Turn of Events, a lot of songs from that album were played here, 7 in fact (with the other 2 being in the bonus tracks). Even so, a lot of the classics were played here, such as A Fortune in Lies, 6:00, and of course the inevitable epic (and my favorite Dream Theater song), Metropolis. The array of songs and dynamics is fairly balanced, leaning towards the louder, heavier songs as per usual with this band. As mentioned in the profiles of each band member, there are three solos on this DVD! I don't think I've seen this many on one of their live tapings yet, and each of them contributes well to the overall show. Also, a bonus is that on several songs there is a string quartet that backs up the band and gives a sound reminiscent of some of the tracks from their Score DVD. As usual, the concert ends on a high note with one of their longer, more epic songs. First, there is Breaking All Illusions, which is one of the last tracks from A Dramatic Turn of Events. Of course, no Dream Theater show is complete without an encore, and they chose Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper. Just in case I forgot to mention, the concert is just short of three hours long.<br /><br />The second DVD contains all of the bonus materials. First, there are six bonus tracks. These are These Walls, Build me up; Break me down, Caught in a Web, Wait for Sleep, Far From Heaven, and Pull me under. The two songs from A Dramatic Turn of Events that were not included on the first DVD are played here. Two of the songs include the string quartet mentioned just moments ago, and they do a great job. This DVD also features a Documentary, a cartoon introduction, and a couple of other tidbits. They aren't necessary to explain, but they are cool to watch.<br /><br />I bought the package that also had the CD's of the show. The CDs are simply the songs from the DVD. The first two CDs are the main show while the 3rd CD contains all of the bonus tracks. Not much to them other than that.<br /><br />Finally, time for my favorite part, the mix! I don't know much about cameras and camera work, but it seemed adequate, as did the crowd interaction with the band and vice versa.<br /><br />Overall the mix was quite nice. I did have a few issues, which I will talk about here. As far as the individual instruments go, I think that most of them were EQ'd, Compressed, Panned, etc. fairly well. I thought a few little things were lacking, though. For one, John's backup vocals were a tad too quiet. Also, the electric guitar was a hair too loud at times. Some of Jordan'ssettings were louder than others, so at times he was a hair too quiet. They should have focused on making those more consistent. The bass was also noticeably too quiet, which made the mix sound a tad empty in terms of the low end. Some VERY slight panning on the guitars and the keyboards would have been nice so that the bass would have more room. Finally, I felt the drum mix needed some slight tweaking in a couple of areas. First, the panning on some of the cymbals was a bit distracting and the big gong behind the kit should have had its own microphone (or they should've turned it up louder if it did). It sounded too \\"distant\\" and I'd like to have that \\"full bodied\\" gong sound when he hits it (which was only once or twice, but still). Also, the 26\\" kick drum needed a bit more low end, and the 20\\" gong drum needed more life. It was all \\"attack\\" and no body or low end, both of which it needed a significant amount more of. If I could have made one change to the mix overall, it would be to add in more room sound. It sounded too dry and \\"studio\\"-like. The amount of room sound on Live at Budokan was perfect and should have been used here also. Still, the mix was a lot better than on the Score DVD (where there was too much room sound and the drums were mixed TERRIBLY), so I can't complain too much.<br /><br />Well, I think I covered it all as much as I can. Dream Theater continues to put out great music and live performances, and I think they've still got quite a future ahead of them. Let's all hope and pray they don't go through any more lineup changes anytime soon and that LaBrie gets his hi-mid range to sound like the rest of it, and everything will be awesome! In short, I'd recommend this DVD. I enjoyed it, and I look forward to listening to the music many more times to come. Thanks for reading!several songs there is a string quartet that backs up the band and gives a sound reminiscent of some of the tracks from their Score DVD. As usual, the concert ends on a high note with one of their longer, more epic songs. First, there is Breaking All Illusions, which is one of the last tracks from A Dramatic Turn of Events.

These are These Walls, Build me up; Break me down, Caught in a Web, Wait for Sleep, Far From Heaven, and Pull me under. Along with the first DVD, all of the songs from A Dramatic Turn of Events are recorded here. Two of the songs include the string quartet mentioned just moments ago, and they do a great job. The second part of the DVD is a documentary, which chronicles the hiring of Mike Mangini in 2011, the set up and sound check, Dream Theater's pre-show antics (with some nice humor in there, lol), and other such things. It's always cool to see these guys off the stage interacting with one another and with the fans, so I like that they included this documentary, although it is a hair on the short side. There are also a couple of other small tidbits like the cartoon intro for the band. It gives each of the band members a certain fictional persona (such as a Genie for, well, Mike Man\\"genie\\", a Thor-like character for Petrucci, and of course, a Wizard for Jordan Rudess). All of these characters are doing something different when the Majesty logo shines into the sky Bat signal style and all of them regroup and fly on their plane to the show. Both of the DVDs include Audio options and subtitles. More details on the sound later.<br /><br />The CDs are simply the songs from the DVD. The first two CDs are the main show while the 3rd CD contains all ofthe bonus tracks. Not much to them other than that.<br /><br />Finally, time for my favorite part, the technical review of the show in terms of the band's performance, the crowd's energy and interaction, and the sound and camera work. Here goes...<br /><br />First of all, the band still retains much of their energy despite being in their 40's and 50's. They really enjoy what they do and you can tell this from the looks on their faces and the way they \\"get into\\" their instruments. They are also still great in terms of their sound and musicianship. I will say this, though: I did notice some flamming with the timing at times. It's pretty short lived, but it happens. I believe they use a click track live now (which is almost necessary on the songs with backing tracks), and I think this may stir up extra stress at times, which is understandable with all the twists and turns the time signatures, dynamics, and tempos in these songs take. Of course, all musicians, no matter how great they are, are bound to have some hiccups now and then. It happens on most of their live performances. Plus, my ears are quite sensitive to timing errors, even very slight and short-lived ones. There are a couple of instances where Petrucci gets ahead of the band or where Mike doesn't come in right on time (like when he first comes in on Beneath the Surface and Breaking all Illusions), and at times Rudess gets ahead as well. Vocals are very dynamic to begin with so it's hard to judge those, although James seemed right on time the entire show, as did Myung, though I could be wrong due to the mix (more on this in a bit). Again, though, there is no getting past the fact that these guys, as godlike as they seem, are human and do make mistakes. They are pretty small, though, and they always recover very quickly. The band interacts very well with each other and with the crowd. During guitar and keytar solos by Petrucci and Rudess respectively, they go to the front of the stage and get closer to the fans. And of course James talks to the crowd throughout the songs, encouraging them to sing along and clap (which is only practical during the more basic parts of their songs, haha). Even with the slight timing errors that are common to every musician who ever lived, the band delivers well on their performance and interacts with the crowd very well. 4.5/5 is what I give them here.<br /><br />Now for the audience. They say that with Dream Theater fans, the farther south you go, the more crazy they are. This is quite true, with the audience being on fire throughout the whole show, not dying down much at all. The crowd also gets quite emotional, and as James points out right before The Spirit Carries on, some tears were present in the eyes of the crowd, which definitely shows how much this music touches the lives of Dream Theater fans. Not much else to say about the crowd, but they were great here. I don't really think the audience needs to be rated, but they contributed a lot to the DVDs and CDs.<br /><br />The camera work was pretty standard for a Dream Theater show. To be honest, I'm not very tech savvy with cameras, so I don't know enough to give a detailed review like I will with the sound. The crew seems to have done their job well, though. They captured the right moments like solos in songs, and the view of the audience from the stage was quite spectacular thanks to the crane camera. They even managed to capture some great emotion from audience members throughout the more powerful songs, which is always a plus. If I remember right, there were 16 cameras. Again, they did their job well, although I don't know a whole lot about cameras and camera work. This also gets a 4.5/5.<br /><br />Finally! The sound. Pardon the pun, but the mixes throughout Dream Theater's various recordings have been a mixed bag. I'm fairly picky with mixes, although I'm not too talented behind the sound board. Still, I have ears and I know what I like to hear and how I like things to sound,so I'll go instrument by instrument and review each, and then I'll comment on the miscellaneous aspects of the mix (room sound, audience sound, etc.).<br /><br />First, the vocals were mixed pretty well overall. There were two voices, James and John Petrucci, with James obviously doing the lead parts and John doing the backup vocals. Remember how earlier I said that there was a twist with Petrucci's vocals here? Well, it seems like they ran some samples into his mic or maybe even overdubbed them in the studio post production. Although I'm not a fan of doctoring stuff like that, it worked fairly well. There were a variety of effects, but they also let John's natural voice come through the mic throughout much of his singing, which was great. I like John's backup vocals. In my opinion, he sounds much better than Mike Portnoy sounded, who was more of an effects vocalist if anything. The only problem I had with the vocals is that Petrucci's mic was literally just a hair too low (about a decibel or two) compared to James'. Other than that, the vocals were mixed well here. They were clear without being too harsh, which is always a bonus. Vocals get a 4/5.<br /><br />I'm not very knowledgeable about guitar, bass, or keyboard, so my reviews of these will be brief. The guitar sounded great as usual, and you can really hear all of Petrucci's parts here. I had one major gripe, though...the guitar was a tad loud on many parts and it took up too much of the mix. For some reason it sounded like the guitar level was better on the CD's than the DVD, but I could be wrong. The bass, from what I could tell, was mixed properly, but the problem is, like usual on Dream Theater's live recordings, that the bass is slightly too low compared to the rest of the mix (like by 3 decibels). Oddly enough, the level was perfect in Caught in a Web and only a decibel too quiet on the solo on Metropolis, but otherwise it was too quiet to my ears. The keyboards sounded great as did the keytar and Jordan's other instruments. The main issue here is that sometimes his level was perfect while other times he was too low (about the same amount as Petrucci's vocals were too low, like a decibel or two). A tad inconsistent in these instruments, which is why I give them a 3.5/5.<br /><br />As a drummer, the drums are what I know the most about out of these instruments, so this part will be more detailed (sorry, lol). On the whole the drums sound pretty good. This is quite refreshing after how horrible they sounded on the Score DVD, and so I'm fairly pleased. The toms sing, the floor toms rumble, the snares have a great crisp mid-range pop (high range in the case of the secondary snare), and you can really feel the kick drums (3 of them at least). The cymbals are a bit of a mixed bag. First of all, I thought two of his hi-hats and at least one of his stacks were a hair loud. The rest of the cymbals are mixed and leveled about right. The main issue I have with the cymbals here is the panning. Two of the high hats as well as the side splashes and stacks are panned too much for me. Yes, it keeps the drum mix clean and it helps spread everything out, but too much panning is distracting to me. For some reason this sounded a bit better on the 5.1 sound setting than the stereo, but only slightly. Not quite enough. Sometimes panning too much makes things sound like they are a little off even though they're not, so I wish they had not panned those cymbals as much as they did. As a final note on the cymbals, I wish they had a separate mic for the gong. Even though he only uses it once or twice, it was noticeably too quiet and \\"distant\\" sounding. The next issue I had is that the 26\\" bass drum sounded a little weak to me. Yes, I know this is gonna sound too picky, but I think that since it's the biggest kick drum, it should sound the biggest and bassiest. It didn't. It sounds like he doesn't have any dampening in it, and so it has a predominant mid-range attack to it as opposed to the more focused low end punch like the others do. This is quite similar to the problem I had with Mike Portnoy's Albino Monster...the 26\\" kick was disappointingly weak. This is just my opinion, but I think a kick drum that big should blow people back against the wall when you hit it. Instead, it sounded like it was a step down from the rest of them in terms of its power. Speaking of bass drums, the other issue I had was that the Gong Drum sounded dead. I've heard that thing shake the whole arena before, and although I think that there shouldn't be too much low end to it, it could have had quite a bit more. I wanna really feel it through my headphones. Instead it sounded like Mangini was playing on a single headed tom with like 3 felt strips. He does an impressively fast roll on it at the end of Outcry, and I would've liked to get a lot of rumble out of it. Instead, it's a major step down from the largest floor tom (kinda like how the 26\\" kick related to the other ones). Lastly, as crisp and clean as the drums sounded, they were too dry for a live mix. The live drum mix on Live at Budokan had the perfect amount of ambient room sound on the drums, and I feel that same amount should have been present here. The level of the drums was pretty good overall, especially in comparison with the rest of the mix. Drums get a 4/5 from me here.<br /><br />Whew...that was a lot. Those are the things I liked about the mix and things I would change as far as individual instruments. I felt that the audience noise could have been a hair louder, and I feel that the whole mix (especially the drums, as already stated), could have had a little more room sound to it. It sounds sorta like a studio recording with some audience noise in the background. Again, Live at Budokan had the perfect amount of room sound on the instruments, so I wish they would have given more of that to the mix. As a last note, I liked the mix on the CD better than on the DVD. Everything seemed much more well balanced (notperfect, though). In my opinion, the stereo setting on the DVD sounded very plain and quite weak. The 5.1 setting sounds pretty good, so I'd say go with that one. My computer didn't support the surround sound setting, so I couldn't try that one out. Lastly, I think that along with turning the bass up and the guitar down a tiny bit, I would have done a tiny hint of panning on the keys and guitar to make more room for the bass. Not as much as Live at Budokan, though, which despite having good sound had too much panning for my tastes on those instruments. I give the mix a 4/5 here. Not perfect, but still pretty good.<br /><br />Well, I think I covered it all as much as I can. Dream Theater continues to put out great music and live performances, and I think they've still got quite a future ahead of them. Let's all hope and pray they don't go through any more lineup changes anytime soon and that LaBrie gets his hi-mid range to sound like the rest of it, and everything will be awesome! In short, I'd recommend this DVD. I enjoyed it, and I look forward to listening to the music many more times to come. Thanks for reading!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|A scary read that turns out to be true.  The author deserves great credit for bringing light to such a deep and secret terror.  Would love to get our young people out of Facebook for a few days and read this book.  It would make them realize what's really important.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a production that integrates itself into one's concept of entertainment.  Uniquely different from most stories represented as syfi.  Well thought out story lines, with excellent writers.  Some episodes excel but all are great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game.  the whole family can play and the kids also love it. I like the updates and the new venues.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|This is a fun app to play. It is challenging. But you will have to pay for the other aircraft that are available to fly.
B00BATG18K|4.0|A beautify woven and entertaining tale that leaves one feeling hopeful about life's uncertainties and so much more intimately and infinaty connected.
B009ZFPQOQ|2.0|I don't like this app because it has to many confusing items on the screen. Also, the graphics are corny looking.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Its really a great show, we were bored with the daily news and found this to be a great alternative.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|This is an old CD but I still enjoy listening to it. It is not you regular HIP HOP music. I think it is more original and creative.
B008JAGZDE|2.0|Was looking forward to this after laughing at the first movie. Big let down and not very funny. Not recommended.
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|This is a great book. It fundaments the theory of why it is good to think of others and always try to give more than what you take. Live examples.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Exciting throughout, and I liked how it brought many individuals' stories together. It was a bit frustrating how often you switched between them, though.
B004EYSXT8|5.0|The talent code is about Mylene - a substance in your brain that is in great part responsible for you learning and succeding in new tasks and a new job or position.<br /><br />I found it interesting to confirm that the only way to learn and become a master is to push against what you fail. Intentionally face adversity. Whether this adversity is called a video game, a new job, a new challenge or something you are not good at doing. Persistence and Intention will activate Mylene and take you there.<br /><br />An interesting book backed up by research. Great job to Daniel Coyle.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a great read! I could not put this book down. Read it in an afternoon. Well written, and the author made me a believer!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Great book - didn't enjoy the blasphemy, which seems to be a new thing with Lee Child. He has also increased the sexual explicit content.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great diversity with the plot and character development.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting to see the next episode.  Very addicting!
B005JTAP4S|5.0|A fantastic read from the very first page! O'Brien is cleverly creative in this story about young Peter.  Once the story begins it never stops.  Imagine if imagination had an imagination.  That's what you will get with Peter: A Darkened Fairytale.  I read it in two nights and I guarantee my 14-year-old will read it over the weekend and be &#34;bummed&#34; when it comes to an end.  I highly recommend adults and their older kiddos read this.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Life changing.  Seriously.  The binkie stays in my son's mouth and he's happy.<br /><br />The price is ridiculous so I bought a beanie baby for $3 and made my own by sewing a loop of velcro into it's mouth. Now I can switch out the binkie for cleaning of the animal AND the binkie.  If you don't mind paying the $$$ these are great and do the job.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Just started playing.  Pretty good so far.  Works good with my kindle fire. Cute little characters.  Nice family friendly story
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Overall, I thought this book was great.  The characters are well-developed and the plot is excellent.  I'd have given it 5 stars if not for one little thing.  The story focuses on three women. In the beginning, they appear to be only loosely connected but as the story develops these connections grow stronger.  In the end, though, I could only see the relevance for two of them.  If the chapters relating to one of the women had been removed, I feel it wouldn't have changed the story at all.  Don't get me wrong, I liked her storyline, it just didn't seem to have much to do with the overall plot.  But the book is good enough that I was able to overlook this and I still enjoyed it greatly.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Good Bond story line ... Kept up the excitement throughout.  If you like James Bond movies, you'll like this one.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This is definitely a movie you should own.  It captures the original wizard of oz with a twist.  Every family oriented movie. It explains how Oz ended up in Oz.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|it was a really cute cartoon:)...it was a really good family movie /nite....well worth the money;)...my kids loved it:-)!...youll love it too
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Wow!  Simply mesmerizing!  I was so happy book 3 was finally released!  I couldn't put it down.  A perfect blend of entertainment, real world happenings and spiritual awakenings, elude to a world that really hits home. I simply love the portals, time control, the general style of how the story is told.  Brandt Legg is by far among the top 5 of my favorite authors list!  It would not be hard to admit that I would read anything this author releases!  I'm not a big reader, so that is a huge compliment from me.  I generally have a really hard time finding an author's writing style and story line captivating enough for me to get more than 3 or 4 pages into before I lose interest, and yes, that even includes world famous authors.  He's also an amazing photographer as well.  If you haven't yet, you should definitely look him up on Facebook and follow him!
1451626657|1.0|I read Catch-22 since people I know said it was funny, a classic, and well written.<br /><br />The book was none of these things.  The humor was very juvenile, not funny, boring, and very outdated-there's an entire joke about how some character supposedly looks like actor Henry Fonda.  If you were alive during WWII and in your late 70s, 80s, or 90s now I can see why someone that age would enjoy this book but the humor has not aged well at all.<br /><br />The characters were unrealistic, bad cliches, and bad stereotypes.  The whole message of &#34;War is bad&#34;, bureaucracies get nothing done and make no sense, there's hatred and bigotry in the world, etc. have all been drummed into our heads so much that it's pointless reading this poorly written novel since the reader learns nothing new from reading this book.
0307120007|5.0|You gotta love this book.<br />We went through multiple copies for our four kids. It's the best way to teach reading from early infancy.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I just finished reading the book, it was really good.  The imagery and the story were so compelling, and it also helped that my curiosity about Dan has been festering quietly in my mind.  I think it is an absolute must read. All my questions were answered, and I felt satisfied with the ending.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Scary movie in the fine tradition of the Exorcist and what not. The part I can figure out, excepting that is probably because it is a movie and must be carried to its completion, is why in the world would anyone stay at a place like that after the first scary signs? I can understand a bargain deal where they purchase the house for a steal price, but I do not think that a heavy discount can compensate for the apparitions, all none too nice. The first time one sees a figure on top of a dressing piece, with the most scary look this side of a Halloween gone wrong, it is time to warm up the car and haul the children out the door, before the evil that lurks starts getting any more funny ideas that the whole family is going to be possessed by evil incarnate. Scary enough to warrant a 4 Star rating!
0142501123|5.0|Cute pictures and very clever story about a friendly witch who shares her broom with friends and is saved by them.
B005PK56TA|4.0|trying to catch up with current season, really liked the suspense and drama and the characters came together very well
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Terrible build quality and will fall apart. I have had 2 pairs of this headset and both were broken within a few months. Spend the extra bucks and go with another brand.
0684833395|5.0|FEED ME.  I will never forget those words.  They make the book.  It is a great book, and I have empathy for those involved in the insane war.
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|Having been a fan of Marvel comics growing up as a kid, I was really glad to see the marvel universe come alive on the big screen. And I think for the most part most of the movies have been good and true to the comics. But now having a weekly show on the small screen only helps to give me that dose of Marvel. I hope this shows get renewed by ABC. I know with most shows the first season is tough because the writers and actors have to get adjusted.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is a great movie, wonderful acting and not with the 'good ending' most movies have.  I love all the actors in this movie
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Once more I fell under Stephen King' s spell. The Shining was one of my all time favorite books by King. I too had wondered what happened to Danny and his mother. I  was hooked from the beginning. The addition of Abra was  great. Maybe  we'll see her again sometime.
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|I'm an avid reader of Allie's blog, Hyperbole and a Half, so I've been counting the days till her book came out. As usual,I laughed at all of her wonderful stories and crazy drawings. It's a fantastic book. The only negative is that about half of the stories are on the blog. I enjoyed reading them again, but I would really love all new material. Time for a second book!!!
0316322407|4.0|Very informated about the region that she grew up in. She is an amazing youn girl,(woman) that I hope we will hear more from in the future. Her speech to the UN is a must for anybody interested in her.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Awesome game, great way to unwind and relax at night.  Hard and easy at the same time, never dull, keeps your attention
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I have read or listened to every Scarpetta novel. I found this one similar to the last two -- too many things happening, too much technical details, too little character development.<br /><br />Can't Scarpetta and Benton have at least one steamy love scene? Nothing too graphic, at least a hug or kiss when they see each other for the first time in weeks? How is their relationship? I want their great love story to get better.<br /><br />What about Marino's dog, Quincy? Is he actually learning to do something? Has he contaminated a crime scene yet?<br /><br />How is Lucy doing? She acts more like a robot each time we encounter her. Why can't she have an interest or two on the side? OK, her mom was a jerk but she is well into adulthood. Many children with bad homes become decent and loving human beings. Maybe she is the one who needs a dog, not just Quincy who sits in a crate all day or Sock, who seems to sit at home or with other people all day.<br /><br />Maybe I missed the point of the novel because I listened to the Audible version of it. The narrator just didn't hold my attention like other narrators have.<br /><br />Or, maybe it is just time for the entire cast to retire. Send Kay and Benton to some Caribbean island, Marino off to the South Pacific, and Lucy to whereever she wants to go. Not sure I will buy another book in this series, if there is one.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love this game, worth the money, just wish it had lasted longer! or had more levels.  Keeps your interest but not so hard you give up
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|This application makes viewing the stars fun.  The constellations are easily seen,  to the degree of draining the charge -and not caring.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This book is really great!  This is must read for any parent - really talks to opportunity creation and different ways
B00A8ECU24|3.0|if you wanna get your pony on, this is good game. in game purchases are a must for most things so be warned. lots of fun to interact with ponies following the series much like Sims but can be busy for anyone.
B00915G6R6|5.0|My husband and I love this made for tv series.  I have all seasons.  I think if my husband likes this series it must be good.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A wonderful story of friendship, family and love in a time when the world was dark and full of hate
0812993845|5.0|Excellent book, I totally recomend it. It was delivered in perfect conditions. I tried to find it in other stores and I was surprised that it was very easy and fast to buy it here, and it was cheaper!
B00EY8AL1M|5.0|best show ever made in the history of the universe, yes I said its the best show ever made in the history of the universe
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|This is a relative new cd....Beth's collaboration with Joe Bonamassa is excellent. Her unique voice coupled with one of the best guitarist of the day! is really something.
031623480X|5.0|Dr. Perlmutter is a doctor that I highly respect because of my experience with his care of my dad.  The book is well written and makes sense.  It is worth reading an applying to you life....our country does not understand the concept of eating right or not taking too many pills...he explains the need for a healthy diet and healthy life style.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|to much swearing, cussing and blastpheme. turned off because of language.  would have liked to watch but modern hollywood is myopic and full of greed
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first sampled the tracks, now that I have the album it's pretty amazing! It's a bit all over the place and messy in a good way. Reminds me of 60s soul,70s, 80s pop,modern indie rock and everything in between. Some songs remind me of Sting and The Police back in the 70s and 80s. I like the experimental elements of the album, not enough bands are willing to experiment and take risks. The cd is really moody and atmospheric for the most part. The vocals also seem different on every track, I don't know if they have multiple vocalist, but this album is epic! It covers so much ground. Great job guys! I look forward to future releases!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham needs to move from Mississippi or at least take a sabbatical somewhere else. As he states (humorfuly I hope) in the author's note, &#34;Long paragraphs of fiction were used to avoid looking up the facts.&#34; The protagonist, Max, wrongly imprisoned by the Feds, plots with a cell mate, also wrongly imprisoned, to &#34;get even&#34;. He will retreat to an island resort to drink and make love to a beautiful woman while the helpless Feds cannot extradite him and his millions in smuggled gold bullion. Grisham keeps this prison-fantasy alive with his good turn of phrase and twists in the plot but Max's love scenes are mechanical and Vanessa, his love interest, comes across with all the pizazz of a blow up doll. The facts: the Feds (FBI, US Marshall's Service) are not that incompetent, prisoners are not that smart.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful album, so humble, so elegant and mortal. It really shows his age in a graceful manner. It's more of a Sunday evening dinner with the sun slowly fading than a Friday night party. Full of dark vulnerability and class. His voice, so husky, growing heavy with time, the instruments dancing slowly to time. Ageless, it ascends and transcend time, immortal to growing old. It's a spiritual and deep journey we all take, sadness and happiness become humble. Heart and soul take center stage, finding peace and stillness. Candles set the mood, love is in the air, life has found closure, life is complete.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|The graphics are awesome, the fight scenes were very well done.  I purchased the movie in 3D and my son and I watched the movie and had a great time.  If you are looking for a good story, realistic plot or nail biting drama, pick something else.  This is just a fun, high graphic robot kill monster movie (please leave reason at the door and you will have a great time)
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Good film. Well acted. Not earth-shattering, but it is a good way to kill a couple of hours, and does pace well.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The price was right and the picture was very sharp. I also like to have the digital copy disc which you can watch on I-Pad.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I am not a hiker or a camper.  But this book captured my imagination and had me hooked.  Cheryl writes with eloquence and humor.  It's a book I will retread.
B00005V9HH|5.0|We've seen this movie a couple of times now, it is good enough to stay in our collection of DVD's. Kevin Spacey is the twisty one here and at the end.........well it is very good.
1904633021|5.0|I have Sense and Sensibility on DVD and the book.  I love this story so much, I bought it for my granddaughter.
B00AGE5P0U|5.0|Nice and twisty, you sort of know where it is going and it does, but does so in a way that keeps your attention. I've watched it twice and enjoyed it both times.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Got a half dozen good books on my reading list that I'm pecking away at. Then this this book comes along and I read it in one fell swoop. The movie is outstanding as well.
0385537131|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this latest Grisham novel.  I rate it as among his best.  I liked going back to lawyer and his wife who were previously featured in &#34;A TIME TO KILL&#34;.  I could hardly put it down to go to sleep.  I shared it with my husband who would also rate it 5*
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm not sure the final book in the trilogy lived up to my hopes after reading the first two but  I really enjoyed this series. They are fast reading and the action is engaging.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I always sing with this! I've never stopped watching it since it first came out! Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick are amazing!
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|This is such a wonderful birthday present!!!!  When it seemed as if my birthday wasnt going to be something I wanted Bey goes and pulls one out the hat!!! I can not wait to open and enjoy. Thanks Beyonce

B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I like it. It works really well. I downloaded it to my tablet for easy access. Works wonderfully. I would recommend this to everyone.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Interesting learning about North Korea and this young man's journey.  Parts of the story seemed disconnected and details were lacking, but maybe that is because Shin did not share those details with the writer?
B00006AG5N|5.0|One of best Elvis Albums ! I own this and I just love but of course I love anything to do with Elvis Aron Presley!
B008XCPO2Q|5.0|OMG I can't stop watching Channing!  Can't wait for the sequel.  This man moves like no other.  And the intensity in his eyes....swoon!
B002UHSDUK|4.0|My friend let me borrow this and I must say, this got me into the foo fighters. Really strong CD that would be great for someone new to the foo fighters, since it has songs from every CD except wasting light, since it came after this CD. The reason I only gave this a four though is that almost every song on here is on their previous albums, and you don't get much from this if you are a seasoned foo fighters fan if you are only buying the CD. Make sure you get the DVD because that's what's worth your money.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Main reason I bought it was to play my iTunes video library and google stopped it. A big disappointment on google
0399162097|5.0|I'm always a sucker for anything ape and or monkey and Karen Fowler did not disappoint. You lookup her authors bio page just to make sure she herself wasn't raised with one.  She makes it so real and believable. You feel so much shame for the human race to think what really has gone on and on for these almost  human counterparts. It was a novel though and a great one at that.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great book with a lot of important information that EVERYBODY should know.<br />You have a lot of friends, but wheat may not be one of them.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|It's ABBA, what else can you say?  I love this set because it has so many more songs than I ever knew they did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I tried not to get into candy crush because of everyone talking about it all the time but a friend of mine asked me to help her get off a level and that was all it took. I am addicted and loving it.
B002I9Z8DK|4.0|Great movie, great effects even today, but not blu-ray quality of modern bluray movies...it just wasn't made well enough to warrant bluray.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waste endless amounts of time playing this, but it's so much fun!!  I definitely would recommend this to anyone!!
B000VIK8D0|2.0|Confusing mess of a movie. Not enough character development.<br />I know now why it failed in the theaters.  Only watch it as an Amazon Prime freebie. Dont waste good money on it.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Wonderful app, not only is it addicting and fun but  it is also a good message to people about being safe around trains! And who cant resist those cute little characters who sing dumb ways to die and stand at your own little train station! Overall, thumbs up; good job guys!<br />-Dean &lt;3
B0039PPW60|4.0|I bought this board to do basic podcasts with guests who are on the phone (Google Voice) or connected via Skype. I thought the USB connectivity would give me all the control I need over the audio coming from the PC, but as it sits now I am not seeing a reasonable way to get sounds from the PC into the Main Mix, which makes the following text from the Behringer website appear misleading (at best) or entirely false (depending on how you interpret it).<br /><br />\\"Thanks to the built-in, bi-directional stereo USB audio interface, you can connect any of these mixers directly to your PC or Mac computer via a single USB cable. Now any signal source you connect to the mixer can be recorded directly to your hard drive....\\"<br /><br />Granted, I am a bit of a newbie, but I can typically resolve technical issues on my own, given time. Not this time. So I'm currently giving this a 2-star rating because it's not meeting my core requirement (ability to record sounds from the PC into the Main Mix). It's not a configuration issue with the Windows 7 Sounds settings; those have all been set up properly (you'll just have to trust me; I won't go into it here.) And the issue doesn't appear to be clarified in any way on the Behringer support site.<br /><br />So, here's the information I sent to Behringer support:<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />I have a Behringer XENYX X1204 USB. I have looked online everywhere and read the behringer support forums but I don't see how to resolve this problem:<br /><br />I am trying to get normal PC system sounds (anything that comes from my PC speakers) into the Main Mix.<br /><br />I've tried using a simple R/L stereo cable from the PC to the 2-track/usb RCA inputs on the board, and although doing that allows me to hear the sounds from the PC, I cannot get those sounds into the Main Mix--they are simply not going to Audacity. I have tried all button configurations for 2-TR/USB on the board; still no sound from the PC speakers is going back to Audacity.

B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Seen previews, purchased the movie. bowl of popcorn and watched one night . good plot, lots of action and great ending. Will watch again.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|Sevyn Streeter makes this album. Songs like Party Hard/Cadillac is definitely one of few redeeming tracks on this album. I like it because of her,
B00B6QXN56|5.0|came across his music one day and loved the way he played. I enjoyed listening to this kind of music and the way he plays is rated with the greats. you wont be disapointed. AAA+++
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|THIS WENT RIGHT TO MY LIST OF THE TOP 5 ALL TIME MOVIES.  YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Wonderful performances across the board and a riveting plot that's based on the actual experiences of Henry Hill, with that Scorsese touch of great cinematography and ironies atop ironies.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|i was surprised how much i liked this movie the beginning jumps right into the action and adventure i enjoy at the movies
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|For some reason this game kills my battery even when it's plugged in. Other than that fun game but it's pay to play wich I don't do. I just play time to time so I realy never run out of lives and haven't hit a wall yet.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|this movie was awful i kept expecting something big nothing came i am just glad i did not spend 10.00  on this movie
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|Great easy reading. Couldn't wait for more books by this author.<br />Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good,<br />The above is just filling in the min. words...!?!?!?
160459201X|5.0|Such an awesome book!  I have loaned it to a friend and my friend had the same reaction.  Simple but profound teaching
0553386816|5.0|I like Grisham's books.  This is a series of short stories and have O Henry quality ends in a couple of them.
B005544TRQ|4.0|It's fun and that's not a bad thing. Also light on the plot and character development, which is why it gets four stars. Definitely recommended.
0061733199|5.0|My all weather camping/hiking son requested this, and I visited him in July and it was nice to see him put some of the skills learned from this book to use. We spent a few days at the Northern Washington State beaches, Olympic park,  and a few days in the Rainier area and never carried water or matches, sleeping bags or tents. I liked mostly seeing his confidence in the &#34;way out&#34;. He gives this book much credit!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting with good plot lines and character development. Haven't finished watching but Season Three has been much better than Season Two.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|it works great if you know what your doing some videos are copy right so technicaly its illegal to download that's why link is broken when you try to download it you also need to know if your device can support video quality
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|My teenage daughter recommended this book to me and I finally got around to reading it. It was a surprisingly not so depressing book about kids with Cancer. Very well written, starring likable, clever characters. A librarian I spoke to said that she didn't like the book very much because the characters weren't believable and that they were too witty to be real teenagers. I don't agree--maybe real teenagers don't speak like these characters do, but it would be cool if they did! Also, if the book were some glum, depressing book about kids with Cancer, I don't think as many people would be reading it, and we all want our kids to read, right? Probably, if I were my daughter, I would give the book five stars. I really liked this book, but my predictions about how the book would turn out were right on, and sometimes, I like to be wrong. Still, enjoyable. Oh, and I have been very close to the Literal Heart of Jesus, so that was fun!
0375851569|5.0|Dr Seuss is a classic.<br />Great starter set for new parents or just anyone who is trying to introduce a child to the world of Dr Seuss.<br />This are not thick cardboard books, so be careful around very little children, also they are the full version ones so they can be lengthy for some kids (or parents, I really don't like reading fox in socks my mouth just can't take it), Ive seen some of the cardboard ones have shortened versions. That said I bought these for my son when he was two just to read to him and he wanted to look at pictures and he would sit and turn pages and he really hasn't ripped any of them and the cover is hard, so they're in good shape.<br />Personally I am an awful parent when it comes to kids books and movies ( i won't watch a Disney movie, I have his mom take him) and I actually really love reading Green Eggs and Ham. That Sam I am.<br />These are a staple of childhood development and this book set is a great way to introduce your child to Dr. Seuss.<br />The only negative thing about this set, I wish it included Oh, The Places You'll go
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was a very good read.  It  was very hard to put down.  I thought it had a Terrific ending.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Every once in a while you buy something and it turns out to be so much better than you could have hoped for.  These bulbs are brighter than the 75 watt incandescence that they replaced and all six of the bulbs in my ceiling fixtures use less current than one of the old ones.  Bravo..
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Well, what can I say about this album that the other four hundred something reviewers didn't already say?  Nothing, really.  The album is a lot like Dylan's other 21st Century albums, which is to say that it's damn good.  The highlight is the title track, which is a 14 minute song telling the story of the Titanic.  A 14 minute song might seem long, but that's three hours less than James Cameron took to tell the same story!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was my favorite of the Hunger Games series.  I reread it before the movie came out.  The characters are great and Katniss is the best in this book
B002NXOQF2|5.0|The book took quite awhile but it was a really good I really liked it and hopefully I can buy the other version
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I love Matthew McConaughey and he looked sexy in this movie. That being said, it was a great movie! It kept you guessing right up to the end. The 2 young boys who were the co-stars did a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing them in future films. I know there are always questions you can ask at the end of a movie, but this one plain left you hanging. That was the only downside to this movie. I would watch it again happily.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love her!  And the Don Johnson and Brian songs are the very best!  As usual some songs aren't the best ones but can you beat the stars!?
076115678X|5.0|I've worked in the salon industry for over 6 years, and this book is revolutionary. I keep my copy under the counter at the salon I work at so I can use it to teach my struggling curly clients how to stop fighting their hair. It has also helped me personally in ways that are immeasurable, taking me from a fuzzy puff ball, to classy waves.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|All I have to say is that this is my favorite book of the Trilogy, but also the emotional. Overall I loved and couldn't give it less than five stars, I just love Veronica Roth
1400069289|5.0|Very informative and well-written.  This book helped me to understand how to effectively change the physical patterns that I use for daily activities as well as to change some annoying habits around neatness and time management.  I recommend it all the time.
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|It was rather comical, filled with gaping plot-holes, and poorly thought out story lines and script writing. I had been told it gets better in later seasons, but I couldn't make it through the fourth episode of the first season, so I guess I will not find out.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love the graphics and ease of use. The quests are not hard to complete, but wish there were an easier way to build up coins. Would recommend to anyone!
B007R11DKQ|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst movie I have EVER SEEN. The only difference between this movie and any other crappy B-movie is that there is no nudity. Other than that, you could have put this on the Scifi channel after &#34;Sharknado&#34; and most people would have thought they were done by the same producer. Acting is horrible, plot is horrible, dialogue is horrible. I cannot believe Robert DeNiro was in this movie. Don't you remember Raging Bull? Taxi Driver? THE GODFATHER!?!? So sad to see him in this now.
B009M7G1PU|5.0|Love the book, as usually a little slow going, but well written, a little heart breaking, but hopeful.  .. would be great for sequel..
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|a different story line than the usual romance.  was never sure how it would end until the end of the book.
B009193OCM|5.0|it wasn't too long so i read the whole thing.  organized well so you can skip things you are not interested in. gave me a good overview of what i wanted to do in NYC.
B00FHB7398|3.0|Usually Big Fish gives you a free trial on their adventure games, so you can see if you want to buy it or not.  I really appreciate this because some of their games are fantastic examples of point & click adventures, and others are just hidden object games thinly disguised as point and click adventures.  I debated before buying this, but in the end I did.  Would I have bought it if there had been a free trial?  Probably not, after doing a few of the hidden object scenes.<br /><br />Scene transitions are often slow.  Accessing the journal is slow.  However, the actual adventuring is pretty good, with a few inventive twists.  The graphics are good.  Inventory is labeled and works usually the first time you try.  The puzzles are some that I've seen before, but they aren't bad.  This is why the game has received as many stars from me as it has.<br /><br />So, what's the problem,aside from slow transitions?  This game has the absolutely worst, most annoying hidden object scenes I've ever encountered.  This is because it also has the worst, most annoying mis-tap penalty ever.  The penalty seems to be completely random.  It happens when you are trying to move around your expanded screen.  It happens when you tap an object you think is one you're looking for, but isn't, even if you haven't tapped anything for a while.  It happens when you tap the object you ARE looking for!  Yes, even correct tapping will not prevent the penalty.  I was trying to pick up a hammer to smash another object, and I kept getting the penalty.  Not to mention the hammer wouldn't smash the object until I used a hint, which confirmed my hunch that I was correct.  Well, developers, if your object was to make me angry while playing, mission accomplished!<br /><br />The only saving grace was that there weren't as many hidden object scenes as some games have.  In my opinion, putting hidden object scenes in point and click adventures is a lazy developer's way of trying to make a game longer.  Longer isn't always better.  If there is a skip button for puzzles, there should be a skip button for hidden object scenes.  Then people who like them can play them and the rest of us can get on with the game.  At least let us nix the mis-tap penalty so we can speed through them!<br /><br />I played on a second generation Kindle Fire, in the middle level of difficulty.<br /><br />EDIT:  The further I got, the more hidden object scenes popped up.  I would no longer say there weren't many.  Finally, I got fed up with the game and switched to the easiest level of play.  The mis-tap penalty disappeared at this level, which made it much easier to get through the fussy hidden object screens.  I gave back one star, but slow transitions and long-winded cut scenes don't merit a higher rating than that.always better.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|Great movie. The best special effects that I've ever seen. Keeps you on edge from beginning to end. Love it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. each chapter leaves you wanting to know what happens next. Can't wait to finish it.
B00004R99F|5.0|A classic. One of the best Disney movies ever. Added it to my son's collection as it is a must have.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|This should be characterized as an horror movie. The destruction and violence were throughout the whole movie. I anticipated this movie to be in the same vein as the previous versions. I regret purchasing this DVD.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Fantastic show. Great cast. I enjoyed the special features as well. A must have for any George R. R. Martin fans. Great adaption from book to film. I was impressed.
B000025JJ4|5.0|The band should be in the Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame.  They've been good for so long.  Deep Purple reunited.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book has really made me understand better what the afterlife will be like.  Thanks to Dr. Alexander for sharing his experience with us. Both before and after his nde.
1401917232|5.0|Very entertaining, yet also deep and meaningful. The answer to life really is in this book, and Renard gives the reader a good boost to actually follow through on utilizing this answer.
140006922X|5.0|In a recent book club for which this book was selected there was a wide variety of opinions ranging from &#34;thoroughly enjoyed and learned so much&#34; to &#34;returned it to get my money back. This is not a page-turner.  This is a wonderfully researched book by a scholar whose passion is the study of religion.  It is meant, in my opinion, to be read and digested slowly. You will be enriched from the experience, but do not try to &#34;convert&#34; anybody.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|Phil remains the King! I can't wait to see these Illegals in concert soon because I think these songs are going to really come to life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very addictive!  You can spend hours playing and not even realize that you have been playing for so long!  Good for people that live alone!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This book reminded me so much of someone I know,and has given me an understanding of where they are coming from hooray!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As you progress through the levels of Candy Crush Saga the more addictive the game becomes.  It is fun to see what will thrown at you next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i really like this game  level 13 keeps beating me  but i will keep trying  and keep playing the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the resume play from other devices.  Addictive and great game. Glad its on android/kindle version. Love the facebook connectivity to get lives etc from friends.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The truth. Very informative film. The political lean is slight in this presentation. Even if you are inclined to disagree with the premix, it is worth viewing so you know what everyone is talking about with this picture.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|not as good as the movie with Marlon Brando.  If you're going to do a remake, then at least try to make it better!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really well written with some great plot twists. Keeps you glued to the book. Great read that is entertaining without being too fluffy.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|very handy app, works great and I use it a lot for everything from a travel alarm to timing food prep.  very handy, looks good and has a lot of thought put into it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Love this show! So funny!! Amazing humor and great characters! Love that this is the complete collection. If you are going to watch this show then I would recommend the complete collection. Once you get watching these episodes your going to want to watch them all.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|This is a cute movie. It is not one of my favorite animated films but it was entertaining. My little cousins live it though!
B00GME9AJK|2.0|The acting, The cinematography, and the content were amazingly sophomoric and really presented as a work built in ones garage.  Steve deserved better than this effort.  It was not elegant  nor near elegant on any level.  So logically I have to come to the conclusion that it was simply an effort to profit from the  icons death without any regard for what his life's work was really about. .
B005TBN3EU|1.0|This was not a good movie. I would not recommend it and wish I wouldn't have watched it. The first one was much more entertaining.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Definitely better than Book 4, but a bit long in places.  More entertaining and not overly grisly.  Answers a lot of questions raised in Book 4 and asks enough new ones to make you want to read Book 6.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B003MAQLVM|5.0|I love the whole X-men movie series. These movies are entertaining and unpredictable! I highly  recommend watching them all if you can!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Good read.  I enjoyed the BOOK and. Recommend to other readers  I.'ve read other books by this author and ENJOYED most.<br />.<br />.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. I read a few horrible critical reviews of the film before I saw it. Still, I promised myself that I was going to see it so that it was I did. When I saw the movie I was totally lost as to why it has received such harsh criticism. Not only did the movie exceed my expectations after reading the critical reviews - it exceeded the expectations that I had before I read those reviews.<br /><br />This is a great film. It is second only to The Dark Knight as my all time favorite super hero film.<br /><br />The criticisms of the movie are vast. I do not share any of them. I liked the extended focus on the back story in Krypton. I liked that Clark Kent's rearing on Earth was told in several flashbacks. His character was developed in a novel, compelling and entertaining way. I am glad that the filmmakers FINALLY decided to show a super hero flexing their super powers with no restraint. All of the complaints about CGI effects are ridiculous to me. This is a Superman movie. He is fighting super villains this time. How did all of these critics expect for the fights to be depicted without the aid of CGI effects?<br /><br />The complaints about all of the destruction are off base to me. The villains were trying to take over the planet. Additionally, this movie is about Kal-El/Clark Kent becoming a hero. He does not have his super hero tactics perfected yet. Zack Snyder addressed this criticism and stated that there would be repercussions for the destruction that come to light in the sequel. I thought that it was blatantly obvious that that was the message that the filmmakers were trying to convey in the movie.<br /><br />The movie was exceptionally well cast. Henry Cavill was great in the role of Kal-El/Clark Kent (he has not yet taken on the Superman moniker at this point in the story - although it is alluded to in the movie). Amy Adams is a great Lois Lane. Lois Lane is depicted as being intelligent, competent and aggressive in this film. The character is shown much more respect.  Michael Shannon was terrific as General Zod.  He was really great.<br /><br />The music score was fantastic (yes, even the music score was criticized). The score was masterful in the way it drove the tone of the scenes in the film.<br /><br />I can't wait for the continuation of this story. Hopefully, Henry Cavill will have much more dialogue in the upcoming film. He is a good actor and now that he has been successful in the lead role of a blockbuster film the filmmakers should trust him to craft more of the narrative through his acting ability.<br /><br />In the movie theater where I saw the film the movie got an ovation. Most people were standing.<br /><br />Man of Steel deserves far more respect than it is getting. It is one of my favorite films.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|Susan Boyle has a wonderful voice and is very easy to listen to her. Anyone that doesn't get this is crazy. Wonderful wonderful.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I love AMC Walking Dead. I've been a huge huge fan of the graphic novels ever since volume 2 was release.<br />G4TV Attack of the Show always new how to pick great new upstart  graphic novel and comic books. AOTS you will be missed. Big ups to Kevin P,  your my boy.
B006903GX8|5.0|Since I am obsessed by the whole series, it was really good to read about behind the scenes. More, more, more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a vert good puzzle game. I am addicted to it it's a very fun game. I seriously recommend this game.
B008JFUS0U|4.0|What's good: Special effects, massive battle scenes, special effects, plot that's easy on the intellect, and special effects. Those grenade thingies were pretty cool, as were the space ships and zap guns. And popcorn, don't forget the popcorn.<br /><br />What's not: The connection to actual Norse mythology is not just thin, here, it's worn clean through in most places. All that's left, really, is a threadbare shred held together by references to a few of the Old Gods' names. I mean, c'mon - Norse gods, zap guns, and hand grenades? Really? It's possible to put a movie like this together by interpolating within the tradition, adding detail to the classic stories, or even extrapolating just a bit closer to the original canon.<br /><br />But, if you can mentally cut off any memory you ever had of the traditional Æsir and their stories, it's a fair action flick with lots of great effects (did I mention them?). Enjoy the popcorn, and get your kids some books of the original myths. Really.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
0694003611|5.0|Excellent children's first book. I have always loved this story and having it in hardback for the price was simply a steal. Can't wait to read it to my great-nephew. Would definitely recommend. Arrived right on schedule. LJ
1452101248|5.0|Had to give up meat so this is the book to buy, searching for items is also a hoot so gives you a little more on your to do list.
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|I got tired of the charges with the cable build in going bad on my. Now if the cable goes bad I can just throw the cable away and just use another one. The charges my Galaxy Note 2 very fast.  Edit: This charger lasted me about 12 months before it started only drawing about 1 amp from each port. 12 months is a good amount of time to get out of a 10$ charger though I wish it had lasted a little longer. Now it will not even keep my phone charging unless the phone is not in use while charging. I will likely purchase the newer version with a higher amp output. I am subtracting 2 stars since the charger should have lasted longer than a year.
B00005RDRO|5.0|What a wonderful &#34;send-up&#34; of the genre!  The cast and their interpretations are perfection!  This one needs to be watched many times, because there's something new to be discovered with each viewing.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Just love this show, wish it had never been cancelled. HD transfer is ok, not the greatest though. Sound is excellent.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a great game. No worry of having energy run out. Only drawback is you need crowns to buy multiples of some things that would move the game along faster.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|A must have for anyone who wants to survive the inevitable zombie apocalypse.  Don't be fooled by popular media!  Find out the facts for yourself!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|What a wonderful way to learn history. The acting is superb! I like how they take Henry the VIII back to the start with his first wife.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|With this album &#34;New&#34; one can conclude McCartney's well is not dry yet. Having been a Beatle fan since their beginnings (and equally enjoying the talents of all 4 members), I have listened to this CD for over a month now before assessing its merits and offering a review. Clearly John and Paul were the core Beatles as far as songwriting goes. In my opinion John being the best at writing lyrics and the creative leader of the group. While Paul the melody master and musically the most versatile member. Like whichever one of the two you want to ..they were equal as talents. While John's legend has been assured with his premature death. It is Paul and his talents that remain to ensure the Beatle legacy is maintained...and boy has he carried that weight well.<br />After the 1970s and early 1980s stardom as a solo act (eg Wings), McCartneys albums were mixed bags....some strong songs mixed with some filler. I agree with other reviewers here that his last few albums of new material (including Electric Arguments) are definitely evidence of a musical resurgence. I did say to myself what can he do after &#34;Memory Almost Full&#34; that would not be repetitive. Also, his voice has lost some range and his amazing vocal range always was an asset to his recordings. Well always being the Beatle most concerned with pleasing the public, he came up with a winning formula for this new album. A tight set of glistening Pop songs with musical hooks and melodies that reminded you of his best work but sounding &#34;New&#34;. Queenie Eye is as good a Pop single as he has ever released. I find the first 8 tracks as good a string of songs he has ever had in an album since the early 1970s. The remaining tracks aren't bad either. The lyrics to Early Days are as reflective to his life as anything he has ever written..maybe that comes with age.<br />Well even Rolling Stone gave this record a 4 (out of 5) stars and anyone who knows the history of Rolling Stone and reviews of McCartney albums....who would ever think they would rate an album released by McCartney at age 71 that high? Even one of Rolling Stones &#34;favorite &#34; artists Mr &#34;always 5 Stars rated&#34; Bob Dylan said a couple a years ago in an interview that McCartney is the only performer he is in awe of. Maybe Rolling Stone finally gets how talented an artist McCartney is. Their original review of Ram was one of their worst critiques ever. While this &#34;New Album&#34; may not have the one big song like &#34;Hey Jude&#34; or &#34;Maybe I'm Amazed&#34; on it that many are always waiting for, it is in its entirety as strong a set of songs one could hope for from an artist of this great stature at this point of their career. &#34;New&#34; is great! Get it.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Feels very comfortable in the hand. It isn't for precision, but more for drawing. Probably the best stylus I've used, thus far. Might end up getting the new 53 Stylus, since that is the app I use the most with a stylus.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I just got this app today and after like two minutes<br /> i already love it .thank you talking friends<br />Ps i also love talking tom i recommend that two

B00BWQW73E|5.0|It seemed to be an unbiased look at the rise of both Amazon and its founder personally, and held my interest throughout. Very complete and detailed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device for the money. Awesome Youtube playback device, thought make sure your Wifi Signal is strong for good sound and picture quality. For $35 bucks you can't really complain.
B002Q0F6V0|2.0|Alice In Chains is a great band.  Dirt is one of the best records ever made.  This record?  Well, this record feels like you're up on the mountain wearing snow shoes, but instead of snow, this mountain is a volcanic mess that has left a foot of mud for you to sludge through... on snowshoes.  So try as you might to walk, instead you sluuuudge sluuudge sludge over the landscape, bogged down in eternal misery.  That is this record.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This was way better than I expected. It's super fun but very addicting. I would definitely recommend this game. It has almost no glitches.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Zack Snyder's \\"Man of Steel\\" is a divisive movie among fans. Much like Christopher Nolan's swan song for \\"The Dark Knight Trilogy,\\" it has caused quite a stir either being loved or hated, there are few who are in the middle. I am personally of the mind that it was a great modernization of the character and his mythos much the way both \\"Batman Begins,\\" and \\"Amazing Spiderman\\" took the stories we know and added some reality and humanization to them. Say what you want about the film though, it was a complete success for WB/DC/Legendary and has set a fire under DC's that has them scrambling to capture some of that shared universal goodness that Marvel has been riding for almost a decade now.  What I am giving here is my personal opinion on what was well done, and the much debated destruction of Metropolis and killing of Zod.<br /><br />Let's start with the stuff that most people will agree with:<br />Krypton: The opening of the film was absolutely fantastic. This was a real world and it showed in every detail. From the landscape to the science and politics, Krypton felt more real than any other iteration I'd seen on screen. Also the little time we spent with the characters while still on planet really helped sell the relationships later on, and set up the drama as well. I wish there had been more, and I would love to see some flashbacks when we get the next solo sequel, and they could easily set up Supergirl in that flashback as well.<br /><br />The Cast: The cast of the movie truly elevated it to great heights to me. Starting with Henry Cavil who you believe as the outsider that just wants to help, he embodied a version of Clark Kent we hadn't seen before on the big screen. On that same note, Amy Adams played a no-nonsense Lois Lane, who would never be fooled by a pair of glasses. Her investigative skills bring her right to the doorstep of the man of steel, showing she's more than a damsel in distress. Michael Shannon could've chewed scenery all film after seeing his performance in \\"Premium Rush,\\" but instead we got a nuanced, thinking man's performance. His reasoning was completely understandable and though he was vicious you feel for his plight. Laurence Fishburn was a great and inspired choice for Perry White, and I only wish they had given him more to do, and Antje Traue was a great right hand for Shannon, beautiful and ruthless. But it was Russell Crowe's Jor-El and Kevin Costner's Johnathan Kent that really stood out for me, as they exemplified the duality of the lessons they were teaching Clark/Kal. Diane Lane should not be forgotten as she was still Clark's anchor and she definitely played a great Martha Kent.<br /><br />Modern Superman: This is definitely a new take on Superman. Closer to many of the recent modern takes seen in comics and on \\"Smallville,\\" here we have a Clark who is unsure of himself, and his place in the world, he wanders the country and the world simply trying to get by and figure himself out, but can't fight his nature to help people in need. This Clark was a real person that we see, not a caricature of a person so goofy people won't look twice at him.  Clark is Superman and they established that by having him not be the Clark we all know until the end, and even then he's just a normal guy, not a bumbling fool. And once he does figure out his place he embraces it wholeheartedly. And that's the beginning of the Superman we all love.<br />The Suit: The movie rested on how Cavil looked in the suit and he fit it perfectly. Starting by building an impressive physique to go under the suit, Cavil and Snyder wanted real muscle not padded musculature for this new Superman to feel like he really could lift a car above his head. The design of the suit itself is a testament to the dedication to detail. The suit looks alien, and yet it still looks classic. Sure it's missing the underoos but it still says Superman when you see it. The use of the CGI cape was awesome as it allowed for some truly iconic poses.<br />Flight and Fight: So for the longest time, and I mean as long as I can remember fans have wanted to see Superman truly let loose onscreen. We finally got that here, and though the reactions to it will be discussed later in the debated section I wanted to mention it here as well. THIS is what a Superman fight should look like! I mean the man can toss cars around like  we do balls, so the action NEEDS to be on an insane level. Not just relegated to lifting heavy stuff, and throwing it the fights were kinetic, and destructive as a fight of that magnitude would be. I remember watching \\"Superman: Doomsday\\" and saying \\"Now that's what I'm talking about!!\\" this was truly what I as a fan had been waiting for. Then there was the flying, and yes I know it comes first in the film but we had seen flying before. Christopher Reeve made us truly believe a man could fly! And Neo did a damned fine job in the last two Matrix films, and Iron Man has made flying just look cool and fun. But here we get the true feeling of speed that Superman has as well. It's not that he's soaring through the sky or weaving in and out of mountains it's the visceral feeling of speed as things blur around him, and the unbridled joy Clark is experiencing when he flies. I think it was actually a great move to have him learn how to fly so late in life, it allows the audience to experience it with him as well as show that even though he is used to having abilities he can still take pleasure in things like flight.<br /><br />Military Involvement: Much like Michael Bay's \\"Transformers\\" franchise MoS chose to highlight the alien aspect of Superman's origin, and in doing so to touch on the phobias that humanity has towards things they don't understand. This film is very much a first contact story in that the world reacts to aliens with fear more than awe and curiosity. Granted had Superman come out to the world before Zod appeared threatening Earth, things may have gone different, but not much. The military involvement is proof of that. From the moment there was a possibility of a threat to national security the Military was involved, and this is shown from the fact that it's not until AFTER the battle of Smallville that they consider Superman and ally. The whole battle they are firing indiscriminately at the Kryptonians, including Superman. Xenophobia is a major part of this film, and the military is pretty much the embodiment of that in the film.<br /><br />Easter Eggs: From a Wayne Enterprises satellite, to several LexCorp objects, to even lesser known references, Man of Steel was chalk full of goodies for long time fans to find. Hell you can Google them at this point they've been pointed out so much. I won't list them here but there are quite a few, some of which are pretty fun, like the \\"Keep Calm and Call Batman\\" sign in the bank during the Smallville battle.<br /><br />THE DEBATED!!!!!<br />Herein lies the topics that are still being debated to this day about the film. Mind you these are my opinions. I state none of this as fact and am writing simply to start discussions. Please no hate messages or telling me how stupid I am. I'm a sensitive individual!!<br /><br />Pa Kent: First of all I want to start with the fact that everyone is complaining about the part from the trailer where Pa Kent's response to a young Clark's question of \\"What was I supposed to do? Let everyone die?\\" was \\"Maybe.\\" It took a second viewing of the film to get the whole idea of what I think they were trying to do with Pa Kent. That scene, or any of the scenes with Pa Kent can't be taken as stand alone, and they really work best as part of the entire film. Taken as a whole, the lesson that was attempting to be taught to Clark isn't one of shame, or hiding, or cowardice or anything like that. He was simply a father trying to protect his son. He wasn't saying not to help, but to do it as secretly as possible, until he is ready to stand before the world. At first I thought he was trying to tell himto wait until the world was ready for him, but that would never happen. Perry White reiterates this when Lois tries to drop the story basically echoing what Jonathan Kent believed; that the world would react out of fear towards him. Jonathan knows his son and knows that it's not in him to not help people. Lois sees this too. It's anonymity that Jonathan wants for Clark, until he is ready for what will come. He wants him to understand that human nature is to fear what they don't understand and that for every grateful person there will be more that want to exploit or hurt him because they fear him, and that puts everyone else at risk, and he has to think about the bigger picture. I know a lot of people feel it's not a good lesson, but it's the one that makes sense for the world today. Besides the fact that the lesson from the original Superman film, that there are just some things you can't change was COMPLETELY lost on Superman in that film, as he reverses time to save Lois. So he didn't learn a damned thing from Pa Kent's death in that. As a matter of fact Superman 2 had another instance of him making a decision and not having to live with it when he gave up his powers, easily rectified by a glowing green crystal, and this actually leads into the next issue of debate.<br /><br />Superman Kills Zod: In 1988 Superman was forced to execute not one but three Kryptonian criminals from a parallel dimension, in Superman #22, which took place after the \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" event that rebooted the DCU for the 80's. But this wasn't Zod's first death. No, Superman killed Zod for the first time in the classic Superman 2 film. YUP! Sure he didn't snap Zod's neck, but letting him drop to a bottomless pit isn't much better. And again three died that day. No one thinks about it because it was a non violent end, but they weren't in a floating piece of mirror anymore. Plus even if the pit isn't bottomless, they were powerless so they either froze to death in pain or jus broke their necks or something. Real humanitarian that is. In Man of Steel we get a serious internal struggle over what to do as you see it on Clark's face. And that death at his hands, the last of his kind, a former friend to his father and the cause of so many deaths in the city will haunt him forever. And THAT bring us to the Superman with the no kill rule. Also it brings us to the final debated topic.<br /><br />Destruction of Metropolis: So people wanted a great Superman fight but they were unhappy with the level of destruction caused by said fights. Well um, sorry it's called collateral damage. Am I a cold callous individual? No! I'm a realist. Plus this is entertainment. That kind aof level of fight does not happen without some buildings and part of the city damaged. I mean watch any comic cartoon with large scale battles. \\"Superman:Doomsday\\" is an example, \\"Justice League and JL: Unlimited\\" are other good examples. The only difference is that there were actually people shown running for cover and such during the battle on MoS. This to me just gave a sense of realism. The city didn't just get magically evacuated when trouble started. Also many people have said \\"Why didn't Superman just take the fight out of the city?\\" And how do you suppose he did that? Ask Zod politely to take it to an abandoned desert or something? Run away and hope Zod followed? Yeah not with the Black Zero above Metropolis, and not while he had to take out the World Engine over the INDIAN OCEAN!!!  Yes he flew round the world in a few minutes to get back to Metropolis. And my personal favorite \\"Why didn't he try and save people in Metropolis?\\" When? While he was fighting Zod? Or While he was trying to destroy the World Engine? My point is he did everything he could to minimize damage by stopping the threat. Simple as that.<br /><br />I love to plays Devil's Advocate and try and defend bad movies. But this isn't a bad movie at all. I loved it. It was a modern retelling of a classic and modern myth. I really though all the changes made sense and were made organically. This was a great way to start their shared universe and I look forward to seeing what they come up withto wait until the world was ready for him, but that would never happen.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Once again Hosseini has not disappointed. I love the way he moves from character to character.  It's like reading a story within a story.  Falling in love with each character...connecting the dots.  I only wish it it could have gone on.  And I was hoping that Abdul and Pari would have met before he became so ill.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think this is an awesome game. My son and I love playing it everyday. We get our hunting done on this game since we never see anything in real life hunting and can't afford hunting trips.
B00992CF6W|5.0|plz update to 1.0.0 I want redefine.  and add pistons and iron doors. I am 12 and I play xbox version.  if you want my xbox live name it is : NO IDABOMB.

B005LAIIN0|2.0|This is only a review of the media in the &#34;World War Z (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy) (2013)&#34; version.<br /><br />It's not clear from the other reviews but the DVD contains the Theatrical Version and the Blu-ray has the Unrated Version. I wish I had known that before I bought it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A simple and beautiful love story - would never have read it unless a friend had gone on and on about it. An unthinkable accident where love arises from  the ruins.......interesting writer who can hold your attention.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|When i bough this book i had just finished Sandersons first Novel. I did not get dissapointed as this new epic saga seems as promising as that was only longer :) looking forward to the next book in the series
1619698463|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!!Great research based information. Easy to understand and implement. Taking control of your life and health. What more could you ask for in a book about health and prevention.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is really entertaining and really addictive. A must have if you enjoy hidden object and puzzle games. Very well made. (:
1401938906|5.0|A very enjoyable book. What a breath of fresh air compared to all of those heavy self-improvement books. Pam Grout is a genius of hilarious overtures on the subject of self-improvement. Most of all, she is absolutely right about self-condemnation being the bane of happiness and achievement in life. Even now, I catch myself thinking negatively about an action, then suddenly, I think of Pam, and her book. I immediately ponder on something great, and sure enough, something nice occurs, and I smile. Success, indeed, is all in the manner of how we truely think about ourselves and even the world around us. Thanks, Pam, for all the work you've done in writing this book!! It's not easy, I'm an author myself.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|After the big hype and the long wait, as a sequel to the brilliant A Time to Kill, Sycamore Row was a huge disappointment.
0446556726|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, but I may be biased since I live in the Los Angeles area and know the areas he uses in his books.  I would still read him, even if he used New York.
0345535561|5.0|Outstanding!  The books were boxed beautifully.  The presentation was excellent as they are much easier to read than mass market paperbacks.  Also, can finally actually see the maps.
B00DQZQPNM|5.0|I am glad that this cover has lived up to its ad.  It protects and helps keep clean the Kindle.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grishams story telling is a page turner,I  didn't  want to put the book down so far his best book ever !!!
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Of course the idea of teens murdering each other is shocking (see The Hunger Games) but it's pretty clever entertainment. I personally think this film does a better job in some ways revealing the motivation of some of the characters who manage to survive until late into the film. On top of this, I found the directing in this movie to be top notch, with some very impressive shots throughout the film. Highly Recommended.
B00E00PEGQ|5.0|One of the best kids movies of 2013. The combo package is the best deal for the tech savvy family. Toy was just a nice touch on an otherwise great deal.
B004GYY714|4.0|I use this app more than any other app on my tablet.  I use it to listen to talk radio on the AM frequencies.  When I moved to the country I lost the opportunity to listen to AM because the radio signal was just too weak.  This app gives me back the opportunity to listen any time of the day or night.  I will rate this app a five when the reception stops dropping out.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I simply adore Elizabeth Gilbert!<br />Her passion and inspiration are contagious, her narrative is precise and easy to follow.<br />Everytime i read her work, it's a joie de vivre booster!, it's extraordinary how this author makes you feel.<br />This book however, is more complex, not chick-lit at all.<br />If you have an interest in science, nature, travel and history like I do, then this book will be a surprising delight.<br />On the other hand, if you tend to avoid such topics then think twice.<br />This book will take you on a journey from the Royal Gardens of Kew to Tahiti and New Zealand with Captain Cook, to the Andes and beyond. Brilliant.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book proves that the author is still producing books that his audience will love.  This story is not the normal 'who done it' but a 'why it was done'.  Jake is defending a will in which the deceased left a very  large estate to someone other than his estranged family.  This is a good book and I recommended it to anyone who loves a good story with many unexpected twists and turns.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I have read them all like so many here. I love when Scarpetta is confident about something -at least about her job.  I love when Marino is annoying but a brilliant detective and not just seen by all as completely pathetic.  I like when Lucy is not so stupid that she is in the middle of everything again, I mean, come on she is a lesbian after all. I didn't get much of what I wanted here but man I still want it all....maybe next time.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A fairly good read, the story moved along with only minor disturbances but in the end, I expected more from a John Grisham novel. This one reminded me of the pot boilers I've read in the past by authors whose only goal was to get the darn thing completed. I hope I was not suppose to like the &#34;hero&#34; because I found him somewhat cruel and the plot felt made up as the author went along. Don't get me wrong, I am glad I bought the book, reading it beat watching television or gazing at facebook posts. But John Grisham is better than this, and I bet he knows it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Excellent book that wraps up loose ends but knowing that more is to come. Very exciting action and well flushed out characters.
B003V99B16|5.0|So how do I personally rate a musical piece of work? Very simple...am I touched or moved by what I just heard? With this album, the answer is a resounding YES! Ennio's music is breathtaking. The arrangements and the playing of Yo Yo Ma is second to none. What a combination. This is the type of album you just want to play by putting on your headphones and shutting out the world. Just sit back and get lost in the music. It is quite a beautiful and emotional ride. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND STUNNING.
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|Takes a few minutes to get use to. The controls don't always work properly and the movement controls are painfully awkward. You can't drag items into your item bar from your inventory, Which is a massive pain. Could use a better tutorial as well. Overall, for 2 dollars, It's worth checking out but they need to fix these issues.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It takes my Google Calendar and puts it in a format that will update on the Kindle.<br />I was so frustrate not being able to use my calendar on my Kindle.  Now I can<br />and it's great!  CalenGoo has a LOT of different settings.  It takes a little getting<br />use to if you want to change the font size or color. But even this works well<br />once you get use to how to modify it.  It works great as it comes but you may<br />want to adjust the size of the font.  It's a bit small.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|IN 3D this is awesome to watch, the regular bly-ray is cool in hi-def but 3D is the BOMB !!!
1907427074|5.0|If you are interested in Roman coins, you know that the books by Sear are one of the few great resources out there to help you identify coins from this era.  If you are not interested in Roman coins, this book is a paperweight.  It's sort of an all or nothing thing.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Christopher Nolan does it again!!! Finally, Hollywood portrays comic book characters how they were originally written!!! Tim Burtons portrayals of Batman were pathetic, and once again Nolan shines through with the best Superman movie ever made!! In 3D its off the charts, with 7.1 surround the sound effects are outstanding, I give this movie a 5+ star rating!!!!
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|I really didn't expect to like this movie.  I figured it would be yet another vampire movie, perhaps like the recent series geared to teenagers or other folks who never grew up.  What a shocker!  It had a great plot and even the story of how vampires are created is different.  The whole idea that there is an order of vampires policing others of their kind was kind of cute as well.  Very well done.
B008JFUR10|5.0|LOVED it...It started reminding me of Transformers but after the movie got going it was a cross between Godzilla and Real Steel, only Diff? The overall story line rocked and great special effects!
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|Very simply, it is a very nice logic game. The entire grid is not on the screen and you should be able to solve each level without guessing. I downloaded HexLogic- Zoo for free, and the photos on that one are really good.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|YOU have got to see this movie in 3D, the real life effect it shows is brilliant, super detailed and by far 1 of the best sci-fi movies  ever made...The sound effects match this rendition perfectly, I'm talkin AWESOME with a capital &#34;A&#34;!!!
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|I've always been a Grisham fan and read most of his books, avoiding some like a painted house.<br />I had a few letdowns but this is not the case, this is vintage Grisham, great reading and nice ending
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|the movie was okay I think it kind of took away from some of the storyline in the original Wizard of Oz. Just my opinion
B008K9UZY4|3.0|was a plesent surprise. very fun. was a nice find.  reminded me of many trips with my son who is now a grown man.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Let me start this review by stating that I'm a little older than the age range this book is geared towards. I'm twenty-eight years old and I enjoyed this conclusion to the series.<br />!!!!Spoiler Alert!!!!<br />I saw the ending coming a mile a way. Just like the rest of you did. If your someone who enjoyed the first two books, don't let the negative reviews scare you away from buying this book. It doesn't end in fairy-tale fashion, but oh well. The character's did exactly what you would expect them to do. I imagine Roth is getting death threats, and for what?
0553801473|5.0|Just brilliant. Lovely twists and turns. Good to see further development of characters. Some big supprises. No hints from me
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|Good conclusion to the series. Pacing was a little off at points, aside from that, I really enjoyed the series.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Doesn't work in hotels or college dorm rooms.  Stupid product, waste of $35.  It should be more clear of where it should actually work.  Thanks Obama

B00F3QYMPU|2.0|I *love* the Simon's Cat videos, and that inspired me to try out a book.<br />The first problem was that I could not download it to either Kindle 4 PC, nor to my Kindle Paperwhite, so I could only read it online, which is about the least-convenient option in existence.<br />The second issue is that this book isn't really a &#34;comic book&#34;, per se, in that it doesn't contain any action strips or anything, it is just a sequence of scenes with no commentary or activity of any sort.  After reading about 10 pages, I just closed it.<br />Whatever beauty, amusement, and action the videos have, the book completely lacks!!  It's a shame I cannot just return it for credit.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The headset is very comfortable, has great features, and a good battery life. However, the downloadable drivers & software by Logitech are quiet the nightmare in my case. I could not get the latest Logitech Gaming Software to even detect my headset. This means I could not change the G keys, bass & other, voice settings, et cetera. However the mic did work with the latest installed, but the device keep turning on and off. Not to mention the latest froze my computer upon the fourth stage of install & after install random freezing. I looked for answers & found super old drivers that worked, but they had drop issues. Leading me to hunt yet again for a higher working driver. Which I found scavenging through Logitech's forums as the support page had no previous driver archive. After installing the one version down from the latest it works much better, but with problems. (You can use it with the basic Windows driver that gets installed via plug 'N Play. However in my experience I had constant drops on every few minutes with just sitting on the desktop).<br /><br />My current problems with 8.45 drivers quiet annoying I must say. Apparently, Logitech has had conflicts with Adobe Flash Player from early developed drivers & software, so I have read. They are as the following.<br /><br />Problems with Adobe Flash Player:<br />1) If I even load the flash plugin on a site via any web browser I get a static/light hiss sound that does not go away until three minutes after I stop the flash video. This can be sort of drowned out while something is playing a video and you can turn up the volume to help a little. Though I am not a fan of blowing my ear drums. Good news is it only does this static noise using the Adobe flash player.<br /><br />2) Using Adobe Flash Player plugin I sometimes get random drops of connection to the USB dongle. It can be very random on when and where it will drop. Though as soon as I back the video up a few notches it is connected again. Other things such asmusic or games have been fine.<br /><br />If you are wanting to use flash or even have a hassle free experience I suggest not buying these. Though if you can live with using older drivers & a few hiccups in flash you can manage. Be warned there are said to be conflicts with wireless routers SSIDs not set to channels one or ten. Be sure you have access or someone in you household that is the network administrator per se can change this. Otherwise you may have a none stop disconnecting headset. Also, if you are seeing random drops try going to device manager to find the device & install the drivers in the Logitech Gaming Software folder. It seems that it does not always overwrite the existing Windows plug N Play driver.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Bosh is back! Book with several old stories and a handful of new stories. Well formatted, neatly colorized books. Waited a long time for this to be released and was well worth the wait.
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|had to return.  it skipped.  very frustrating to be in middle of movie you like and then it skips.  i liked movie
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Wow! I was expecting a free game to be so fun. The graphics are great, and its easy to play without having to use real money. I hope they add more regions, and more guns to purchase. The animals look really real, especially the bears. Hope those more games this good!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Suspenseful, well-written...great escape literature. Grisham will rope you in so that you won't be able to put the book down.
0385350864|4.0|After hearing about the enormous spoiler involving this book (which I will discuss below, so if you want to stay in the dark, stop after this paragraph), I was hesitant. I had loved the first Bridget Jones book, tolerated the second, and given the long break between book #2 and &#34;Mad About the Boy&#34;, I didn't know if the magic was still there. What would it be like with a 50-something Bridget, trying to navigate mid-life, balance work, family, friends, and love?<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />After Mark Darcy is killed in an explosion in Darfur, Bridget nearly shuts down. Five years after his death, she is still grieving for him, trying to raise their two children, and not really able to move on with her life. Unexpectedly a widow, she knows that she must move forward but isn't quite sure how to have a relationship with anyone else. Her friends are trying to get her back in the dating scene, which is difficult on many levels. Not only is Bridget worried about betraying Mark's memory, but dating has changed (especially with the advent of social media) since she was last single.<br /><br />Through the course of two years, we follow Bridget trying to navigate her new single life. She is working on a screenplay that may end up being adapted. She is trying to organize her kids' lives, their school schedules, play dates, and activities. She is attempting to make friends with a frazzled mom across the street. She wants to find someone to share her life with, but isn't quite sure how to navigate Twitter. She also is trying to lose weight, to get back to her pre-pregnancy, pre-widow weight.<br /><br />As she was in the first few books, Bridget is endearing. She continues to chronicle important tasks (such as text messages, weight, calories, time spent on different things), run into embarrassing social situations, and approach life with a naïve, yet hopeful, feeling. But she is not the same woman we saw in &#34;The Edge of Reason&#34;. She has grown up.<br /><br />I had heard so many things about this book, but it was actually quite good. It's different from other Bridget books, but her life is different as well. Give it a chance. It's worth it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like the app but where's my free Amazon coins at? Like I enjoy the game just I want my coins to save up
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is an amazing story with excellent actors and very moving scenes. I have watched it many times and enjoy it every time.
B00AAI7B7W|2.0|HD doesnt do the movie justice. To bright. Had a soap opera look to it. Took a classic and changed it for the worse.
0307476073|3.0|The book is alright and the story is very interesting.  I find myself admiring this woman for taking the journey on her own.  I know I could never do it!
B002JXK5VU|3.0|My wife is enjoying this show more than I am and I'm the SciFi guy in this family. It's just a bit too corny and light for my tastes. There is a fun, cool aspect to the technology, but it's overshadowed by the frivolity.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|Perfect fit, sturdy and reliable. Perfect fit right out-of-the-Box and great to use with optional Zeikos lens cap keeper with attaching sticker and flexible band to wrap around lens of camera.
B00C1040TO|5.0|This little program turned out to be a gem!  I could not figure it out at first, but once you get familiar with it, it works awesome!  I was trying to tune a dulcimer, and none of the other tuners would work.  It takes a bit of practice, but if you take the time, it will pay off.  I am using this on a D2 pad (cheap tablet) and it works great, no hanging or problems.  I don't use the audio side of it, because I have tiny speakers, but if you have a bigger tablet, you can hear the notes.  It works great on voices too.  The only downside, is that it is pretty sensitive, so if you are trying to tune up with a lot of background noise, or people talking, it is a bit tricky.  If you had it hooked up with a mic, it would probably solve the problem?  All in all, a wonderful little program!
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Just as good as RED!!  Very entertaining We purchased because we will watch it again and again.  You won't regret it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive. 5 lives, then you have to wait a half an hour for another one. Makes you want to play even more.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is funny for both kids and adults. Shaun is a riot. It is pretty amazing what this Show can do with almost no words.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|This was the first book of love at first stakes series of Mrs. Sparks.  All her books are great and I collected all.  I recommend to read them and you will not be dissatisfied.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Unbelievable! Captivating story of Jaycee's incredible will to survive! The honesty about the way she felt during her captivity is heartbreakingly touching!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is awesome! It helps me If I need help with homework! I really recommend this app :) I love this app
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a fun game with good graphics that has easy goals nicely mixed with difficult goals. It is a fun game. Give it a try.
0307277887|5.0|This book is everything I thought it would be, a great read. I had a lot of trouble putting it down!
1400052181|5.0|A fascinating story of a young black woman and her descendents.  Truly amazing what medical breakthroughs came about by the use of her cancer cells and how they are still used in research today.
0374532281|2.0|This book was slow in the beginning, however kept you wondering what is going happen next. There was a silverlining.
0241966833|5.0|A must read for all football fans. This also book contains a lot of behind scenes and Zlatan is not afraid to tell them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|AWESOME GAME! If I had to choose between Temple Run and Minion Rush, definitely would choose Minion Rush. Like the French word minion (I remember it being spelled with a G), this game is both cute and competitive. 5 stars!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such suspense in every episode. I couldn't stop! The characters keep evolving, so there's no chance to guess about the next episode.
B000I186FW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  Liked the action and the premise.  DVD works fine, I&#34;ve watched it two times now, and I'll save it to watch again.  Came in the mail fast enough for me.

B004P7CNE0|4.0|It's a good flick.  DVD worked fine. Came in the mail fast enough for me.  I saw clips on You tube and wanted to see the whole thing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play the pc edition and I have to get off and on all the time I think this app is great because I can take it on the go!:)
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Could not stop reading this book and when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking or talking about. Tried to slow down towards the end so I could drag it out and had withdrawals after finishing it.! Can't wait for Hayes' next novel.
030788743X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading it, and I'm really not much of a reader. For gamers this is the book to read! Actually, this book is for anyone who enjoys pop culture from the 80's and before as well as some references to todays technology.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Took my kids to the Selena Gomez show and then later bought this album for them. They love it and I like some of the songs too.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Sometimes I run into trouble like I needed one more move to win or IM all out ok lives but it's the most fun game I ever played I recommend for all ages
B00BD99JMW|4.0|(3 1/2 stars) I actually finished this 2 weeks ago and have been sitting with it before reviewing, as amongst all the uproar over the ending I needed to process it a little bit to figure out what I really think. And what I've decided is this: I am OK with the ending - it's not my favorite, but it does feel true to the individual characters and the overall storyline and theme of the trilogy. While I appreciate when a series leaves me with emotional satisfaction, this isn't the purpose of all books, and an author owes us nothing. Roth did what she felt she needed to do  - this is her work - and I respect that. It's thought-provoking, and that's powerful in its own right.<br /><br />But I still can't rate Allegiant 5 stars, because the larger problem for me with the book are the holes in the 'big reveal' we get. Divergent and Insurgent created an intriguing world for us, with the faction structure creating a fascinating lens through which to comment on our own contemporary society - this is how the best dystopian fiction functions. The problem with Allegiant is that the 'big reveal' - the story behind how this world was originally created - just has too many holes and leaves too many loose ends. How is this genetic agency able to run so independently? Where is the rest of the government and everyone else? How is it that no one has escaped from these experiments, or has always been caught? How do they have cameras all over the experiment, capturing every moment, and no one in the experiment ever becomes aware of this? Then there is the matter of the memory-wipe and death serums, and that there is one per faction - the serums are just way too convenient and feel contrived.<br /><br />Combine that with Tris's and Four's love affair getting a bit annoying at times, and Allegiant just wasn't as satisfying as the first two books. On its own, it was only a 3 1/2 star for me. But I'd still rate the entire series a 4-star, with many 5-star ideas and scenes, so I do look forward to the movies, and hope they pull from the best.to the movies, and hope they pull from the best.
B00785P2QC|2.0|it says its free but will suck you into going to the store to buy things you need to complete what you are doing.  Since that is the case if you don't it gets boring very quickly.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Awful movie. Nudity ugh. Watch 10 minutes and turned off. I thought it was an action movie not what it turned out to be.
B00E0SX118|3.0|Had potential but reminded me of Ice age with humans.  Grandkids liked it all in all but could not really hold thier attention.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie but lots of killing and blood. Special affects great. Next movie will be even better. It will start soon.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great show for the whole family.  Have watched this at least 10 times with the grandkids and they love it as do I.  Humor for both children and adults alike.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that you can listen or read it and the voice is not in a computer voice it's like someone reading to you.  Thank you
B008NW67E0|5.0|Best music I've heard in awhile. Played it for my husband, and he was hooked on them. We can't wait to hear what they do next.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I guess I expected more based on the promos.<br />Yes ,there are a few scenes I found amusing, and the ending of the movie where he grasps truth beats living a lie<br />is a lesson we all learn, eventually. But this isn't one of those movies I'll add to the collection to watch over and over.<br />Shame, as I did expect more.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I waited for this movie to be released since my daughter was born a few years ago. We use all three copies - and especially love the digital copy for play on iPod/iPad.
1250038820|5.0|very interesting book. great pictures. we loved reading all of the stories. my fiance and i loved it. highly recommended!!!
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Great series, see the movie to have a good ending to what would have been many a great seasons. ok
B0080K3G4O|4.0|Like many others, I too was sick of reading those positive thinking books which all seem to have a cookie-cutter quality to it. So this book, &#34;Antidote&#34;, came like a breath of fresh air. The author seems to rely greatly on the teachings of Zen Buddhism and goes through the many approaches to not thinking positively- not exactly the same as thinking negatively, but more of thinking realistically. The book is balanced, because it does not totally belittle positive thinking but tells/advises us to embrace uncertainty.<br />I didn't quite give it five stars because I felt some of the examples were a bit stretched (eg. the chapter on Memento Mori).<br />However, the book still makes us take a reality check and comes at a time when positive thinking is parroted ad nauseum.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The Grandkids really likedCandy Crush wins out this game.  I am not very good at playing these games but I did enjoy this one.  I guess it was not that difficult.
B00005JKDQ|3.0|Good price for a used video. I bought this one to replace the one my son broke. It plays good and the cover is in descent condition.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really enjoying this app. I hope zynga creates more kindle friendly apps like this for their other games. It seamlessly.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It's like reading a lullaby, how the words are strung together in this novel. It's a brisk read and well worth it.
B002NQ3AAQ|4.0|Compelling story, good acting, excellent filming. Billy's father; his personality, struggles, love for his son, were well portrayed.Thought the final scene was thrilling. This is a &#34;feel good&#34; story, but I thought it was done in a believable way. This could really have happened.
B004SBULWE|3.0|I am not sure how to use it.  I downloaded it but have not used it yet.  Need to find directions.
B001FA0W5W|4.0|It's a great book which focuses on the effects of random events on the over all success or failure of individuals and corporations. It also questions the assertions of skill made by individuals when favourable outcomes help them score important victories in their respective professions or fields of interest. The book tends to go a bit heavy on stock market jargon and processes and may prove difficult for those who are unfamiliar with these workings. I still think however that there is a lot to be gleaned from this publication even if you are not into stock markets or understand the language.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I like being able to connect to my computer without sitting in front of it.  I can find pictures or documents without my heavy laptop.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this is an awesome game its fun entertaining and actually quite mind occupying great job I love the song 2
B004GJYRKA|4.0|My husband and I have always liked Bruce Lee movies, even the ones with terrible dubbing.  We had this movie before but the disc wasn't in very good condition.  This one was in much better condition and we were able to enjoy watching it a lot more.
B00A6OORCC|5.0|would someone please tell me why world war z the extended version is 53.99 thats ffing robbery, is the moscow scene left in for 54.00 it better be
B001E75QH0|5.0|This is a great set.  While The Last Crusade has always been one of my all time favorite movies, I enjoyed all the Indiana Jones movies.  This set is a &#34;must have&#34; for any action/adventure movie watchers collection.  Even has plenty of humor thrown in too.  I definitely recommend this set.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app made my kindle act buggy. I have never used a kindle and I don't understand how the app market works. Y doesn't is just have plain old you tube????
B000002LFZ|5.0|I already own this on LP and cassette.  Now that I have it on CD too, I can play it anywhere.  Good music, good memories.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I didn't like the ending, but I guess not all tales end in the same, mushy way. Most eventful of the bunch.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|I loved this movie.  Plenty of action and plenty of humor.  My 2 favorite genre in 1 movie.  I don't like &#34;spoilers&#34; and I won't even let my husband was any of the bonus or special features until AFTER we've watched the whole movie.  So I don't give any details in my reviews.  As with all movies, different people like different things.  I can only say that I really, really enjoyed watching this one.  I definitely recommend it.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Any age can just about watch it. My kids love this movie. Ages 8 to 11.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|My husband and I both love The Beatles' music.  We have quite a collection of their albums.  This quickly became one of our favorites.  It has so many of our favorite Beatles songs all on one disc.  We listen to it frequently.  We would definitely recommend this.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|The acting in this is pretentious, over acted and hard to watch.  I has to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  The characters are talking with accents that do not seem to match their style of acting.  Very glad I did not pay for this at the box office and if I could give no stars I would.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The disc we got was defective and we couldn't get it to play all the way through, but the part we saw of it was great.  I also have the first Expendables movie and really liked that one too.  We had to see the entire movie, so we found and bought it locally.  The movie was very good.  Lots of action and lots of humor too.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B0091VYG86|4.0|This is a great movie and Witherspoon and McGuire play great characters.  The story seems hokey is the beginning, but it soon takes hold and you are drawn into the story.  This movie is also a commentary on some of the social issues in American society ( past and present )
0553582011|5.0|I have enjoyed watching the HBO series Game of Thrones from the begining and all of these books have been much better.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A wonderful creative experience that sent me to the pharmacy for some magnifying glasses, the better to see my village with. Each character has a village on an ice flow that you can visit to see the wonderful possibilities.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Oh my God, this Documentary was so touching that I had to watch it twice. Such a sad and eye opening story! I had no idea of the things that were going on at Sea World. It's clearly obvious that the Whale that has been classified as a serial killer is extremely frustrated. Sea World needs to do some serious improvements! How many people have to die before you realize that there should be a time limit on captivity?
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This movie was as dramatic as most of the James Bond series.  But it also showled an entirely diferent side of 007. Got to learn more about his background and how it made him the man he became. Daniel Craig is not the pretty boy that Connery was, but I have come to prefer his interprtation. Also, the latest movies have not contained as much of the sexual byplay as the earlier ones, which I have not missed at all. Craig's 007 is a lot more gritty.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|I did not like this movie. For one, they weren't hung over at all. The film was mainly about the mistakes they made when they were hung over. I was disappointed.
147676459X|5.0|This gal is a pure talent: her drawings are expressive and hilarious, her writing is evocative and hilarious, and her insights are brilliant and hilarious. She has created a biography to make me laugh and a comic to make me think. She writes with clarity about common subjects—life with dogs, being an unusual kid, coping with depression, parents who do inexplicable things—not only from the perspective of someone who knows, but with the level-headed intelligence and laugh-out-loud humor of someone who makes common subjects fresh and significant. She makes me want to be a better person and she helps me understand why I can't be. Yet her viewpoints are good for what ails me: laughter really is the best medicine! I vote for this book as the bible of the 21st century.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Man of Steel was great! The only thing that surprised me was how much crap they tore up! Of course I know it was all digital but still, Superman in the comics and cartoon series did not tear up half as much as Christopher Nolan's interpretation. I enjoyed it, I suppose it was more realistic than the comics but I still did not like the way it ended. You killed Zod Superman! WTF! Could have at least sent him to the phantom zone like you usually do. I still loved it though!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I bought this solely based on the 5 star ratings it had.  I was not disappointed.  This game was a great brain teased with excellent graphics and sound. It is most definitely worth the two bucks.  If there were more games of this quality for mobile devices, I would spend a LOT less time on Pc and consoles.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I thought this was a good portrayal of the Zombie Apocalypse. I can see something like this happening and the movie kept my on the edge of my seat.
B00EJYGL8S|4.0|The music is great and the visuals are beautiful.  These guys know how to have fun and stage their music.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Oh yeah! This was a good film. Acting was a bit on the horrible side but the special effects were wonderful!
B00D3LA71K|4.0|Something a little different.  McConaughey never fails to surprise.  He has the acting range to play many different types of characters.  Worth a look
B004GJDQT8|5.0|its an app that does what it is supposed to, there is not much to say about it. it works
B001AG52AG|3.0|kept me daughter enthralled in the movie. She liked it so much she has watched it 3 times already this week!
B0026145WK|5.0|one of my favorite movies, it is a suspenseful story about a fathers resolve to stop at nothing until he is reunited with his daughter. great story
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent! Well worth the wait. Characters stayed true to original novel while living out a totally new story line !
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Stop hesitating, No need to read more reviews... Just buy this book and enjoy. A classic from the master craftsman !
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great back pack and very sturdy. I used it while going to school to be a paramedic and that requires some pretty heavy books.
1451666179|4.0|The book itself was well up to my expectations and more. Sadly one of the copies had black printer marks on the front and as it was for a gift had no time to organise a replacements.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Awesome CD. Won't have to skip through any songs. Every song is fantastic. Unique sound and different sound.  Great guitar and vocals.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I like the story line and the characters. I have read all three of the books and really enjoyed them.  Was not sure I would like the movie but it sticks to the story line and the characters are well matched to the actors. I am waiting to see Catching Fire.
0783229364|3.0|the Disk Came unscratched and played fairly well but the case was a little damage. bought this for my mom as a gift.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This is a book with Mark Cuban's life experiences (in business) filled with great tips on how to succeed with your endeavors, whatever they may be.<br /><br />For me, the biggest takeaway was to always aim to be the best at what you do, and to do so, you must love and be passionate at what you do.<br /><br />Great read for any business oriented person.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Truly a great app. It functions well and does not seem to have any real bugs. The thing needs more skins just for some awesome personalization. Maybe black and red or black, neon green, and purple highlights. Personal opinion.
B00FY9JJYA|4.0|Less organic than the original BlackRadio, but still a good listen. Many songs retain that jazzy soulful feel that I've come to enjoy from Robert. Highlights: Lalah Hathaway singing &#34;Jesus Children&#34;  with Malcolm Jamal Warner reciting poetry; and &#34;Somebody Else&#34; sang by Emeli Sande. These two songs really hit my cool mellow spot right now.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Fantastic product.  Has some of the best amps with dual USB outlet for a great price that I could find.  It's also very compact.
1609611543|5.0|This book is very informative. I think everyone should read this book. The information it contains is life changing. The lack of regard for human life scientists have is astounding!
B0063M22QO|5.0|So enjoying learning this game.  I hadn't tried playing before and it was easy at first and as you gained experience it was more challenging.  Wish I had found it earlier.
031623480X|5.0|This book should be a must read for everyone. People need to understand the epidemic on our hands with the poor nutrition we now have. It is a very enlightening and thought provoking book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Wasn't the &#34;adventure game&#34; that I was under the impression I was getting. Figured by the description it would fall more along the lines of the haunt or enigmatis. Don't like the time limit, I enjoy playing casually and in relax mode. Plus, your activity accomplishments are limited by energy level, which makes you wait for it to refill before you can do any more. Seems ok for this type of game in particular, will try to play when my more favored genre isn't releasing their games
1936608898|5.0|Great book! Easy to read and understand. I love the fact that it talks about Paleo with out brining in the evolution side of things and just sticks to the science. Everyone should read this book
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I put this light in a very dark stairwell halfway down where the stairs make a right turn downward.  I positioned it in the corner 45 degrees to either top or bottom stairs, about 2 feet above the landing.  It always comes on, either entering from above or below.  It stays on while there is movement, then goes off shortly thereafter.  The LEDs are bright enough to see all the stairs but not blinding in the pitch black, they are slightly bluish in color.  I'm using 4 Eneloop AA rechargeable batteries.  The light is sensitive to ambient light levels and will not activate on a sunny day (there is a window above the stairs)  This little light makes all the difference and provides reassuring safety in a place without electricity for a normal light.  It actually gives me a pleasing feeling when I forget its there, turn the corner, and it instantly lights my way.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As frustrated as I get with John Corey sometimes, I loved this book as much as I did The Tiger.  Nelson DeMille's style of writing, and his ability to bring to life the situations, puts him right up there with Vince Flynn...........an author I miss dearly.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is the most addictive game I've ever played! I love the fact they finally have it for my kindle. The only thing I don't like is you can't use any of the &quot;extras&quot; like when you play on a laptop.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|I have mixed feelings about NWTS, Overall I think the album is solid his flow is always tight and his hooks stay in your head forever. But for me this album had it's highs and lows. Great tracks on here for sure but in my opinion the over all feel of his last album take care had a better feel. I can listen to that record from start to finish. But with nothing was the same I found myself struggling with it. At some moments I felt a little bored. There are a lot of good tracks on here but then there are a few just ok skippable tracks here too.
0920668372|5.0|Precious little book for parents and their young children to read together before bedtime or anytime. It touches on the unconditional love shared throughout  a lifetime of learning and growth.
B000VWSINI|5.0|Great album by a pretty much amazing artist. Lol let's be real this guy is crazy talented and his fame and skills and work speak for their own. Now I've always been a fan but never thought he was that great. ( I know contradicting to what I just wrote) let me tell you why, I've never been a fan of his  mediocre making fun of people and stupid voices like when he did those songs as that dumb dog. That in my opinion is garbage. But I think this was the first record where he started to stray away from that and started rapping about real issues like his political views and his personal struggles. I mean in his last records there's little glimpses of that but this is the record where he really started to vent witch I think it was great. From this album all the way to Recovery and the marshal mathers LP part 2  comes his best work. It's real and not forced and it comes from a dark place. And no more lame comedy s@!t. Great album.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I kept going back for me. Good read. It's funny how  lives intertwine. Some secrets really are best left UN-heard.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|I just can't get enough of this movie, no matter how much I see it, it makes me laugh...a nice movie.
0395389496|5.0|We received this book from my son's grandma 20 years ago.  We have brought it to school every year for the Christmas parties all kids big and old LOVE this story.  We wrote in it remind us that every year on Christmas eve we have read this book.  I bought it to give to a new baby family.
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|I was really hoping for this movie to be perfect, unfortunately I now know why it was a failure at the box office... I'm really disappointed.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show...so glad I found it!  It is fast-paced, fun...a little snarky.  Highly recommend if you like legal shows, or just fun dramas, check Suits out!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Amazing and fascinating movie, it had less action then the last two( which was not good cause I love the action), but it had a magnificent story, the suspense was exciting and that made it so perfect.
0143034901|3.0|I have often noticed that the back-cover blurbs of many novels do the books a disservice by overly extravagant praise, especially in their comparisons to outstanding works and authors. The reader is led to expect too much, which most often results in disappointment, even though the book in question may be interesting in its own way. That was certainly the case with this novel, which is compared to the writings of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Umberto Eco, and Jorge Luis Borges. Unfortunately, it did not in any way live up to that standard of creativity and excellence. So even though The Shadow of the Wind is something of a page-turner, with a succession of mysteries and melodramatic events, I was disappointed.<br /><br />The novel begins in a very promising fashion when young Daniel is taken by his father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, where he is permitted to choose one book to adopt, to make sure it will always stay alive. He soon discovers that his chosen book comes with a mystery, because someone has been systematically hunting down and burning all the author's novels. Intrigued, as he grows to adulthood he begins trying to learn the history of Julian Carfax, the author of his Forgotten Book, and of the identity of the unknown destroyer of Carfax's novels. Along the way, he finds an amusing sidekick who helps him in his quest and a young lady to love, a situation which comes with its own set of problems.<br /><br />Actually, if I had not expected more from this novel I would have given it much higher praise. I will say it is much above average for popular fiction, but that it is not Literary Fiction, such as one would expect from Marquez or Borges or even Eco. I expect most readers would find it great fun to read.
B003TOPQI0|5.0|Wonderful cast, great plot, great movie....Funny! This is the fifth time I've seen it...it is still excellent. Would watch it again.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|It started off slow, but has started to pick up steam.  The characters are becoming more interesting and Clark Gregg does an excellent job playing Coulson as a man trying to run a team while handling his own self doubts.  I'm still not terribly fond of the character of Skye and I find myself hoping that she either becomes much more interesting rather shortly, or suffers a terminal case of sudden death.  The tie in with the second Thor movie was cleverly done and I am looking forward to seeing where the series goes.
0525953728|5.0|Love this book. Well written, spellbinding would recommend that anyone interested in the real story. Read this book it will give you all details missing from all the other reports.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game.  so addicted.  it's a love hate relationship love 2 play it but get mad at it when it doesn't go my way but its super fun
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Fantastic series - can't wait until the next season comes out. I have recommended it to lots of my friends.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing, Horrifying, Thrilling, and Real. Four descriptors for an amazingly strong Character with only 4 fears. That's all. Thanks for a great series and true people V.R.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great little app. I think it does all it says it's going to do. I enjoy the silly little broom's face as it's cleaning!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Compelling story - full of suspense until the end.  I can see this book being made into a movie.  Great read.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book is hopeful and urged me to be brave in my own life, if not backpacking the Pacific Crest trail by myself than in other ways that are possible. Fair warning it's a tear jerker. I hear they have made a movie, it will be interesting to see if it's something I will enjoy as much as the book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|OOOhhhh this game is so awesome.  It is a real though provoking game and something great to pass the time.  But it is easy to get caught up in.  Love a game that makes you think in order to advance.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book meets the hype and more!  Bravo John Grisham for another gem.  I wish the book never ended and I hope there will be more books featuring Jake Brigance and Clanton
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|This was just not what I expected.  The game is just sorta, well, boring.  Is it racing or BMX with four wheels?  Try at your own risk.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun......don't have problems like on computer so for.....and it hasn't added challenges without you choosing. Just as fun as other and so far no problems with game
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was entertaining enough! Special effects ok & good for kids.  If you need escape time this will fit the bill.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|ok play it a lot souled try it it is very addictive can play on face book hope you have fun
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have read this book over many years, many times, and wanted it where I could always find it.  Dr. Frankel is a hero who survived by the strength of his spirit.  More people should follow his example in times which are not neary as dire as that of the Jews in Europe during W.W.II.  Over the centuries of human history, others have survived genocide; however, in our times we owe those who did so, as in Rwanda and too many other places in the past 100 years, the respect and honor to learn their stories.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|&#34;Sometimes love is an accident.<br /><br />This time, it’s a strategy.<br /><br />Miss Minerva Lane is a quiet, bespectacled wallflower, and she wants to keep it that way. After all, the last time she was the center of attention, it ended badly--so badly that she changed her name to escape her scandalous past. Wallflowers may not be the prettiest of blooms, but at least they don't get trampled. So when a handsome duke comes to town, the last thing she wants is his attention.<br /><br />But that is precisely what she gets.<br /><br />Because Robert Blaisdell, the Duke of Clermont, is not fooled. When Minnie figures out what he's up to, he realizes there is more to than her spectacles and her quiet ways. And he's determined to lay her every secret bare before she can discover his. But this time, one shy miss may prove to be more than his match...&#34;<br /><br />When I read a book, I start out by assigning the book 5 stars.  Then as I read it, I deduct stars when something jars me.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  I wanted to red it when it first came out but the kindle version cost too much for me.  I was able to get it for $.99 from BookBub.<br /><br />It was a relief to read about a heroine who was not the epitome of beauty for all time.  Our heroine also had a fascinating back history.  I also liked the hero.  He was not a perfectly perfect person.  he had flaws.  Among them he said things no gentleman should ever say to a lady during that era.<br /><br />There were 2 things that jarred me.  Enough so that I had to deduct stars and hope my review might catch the writer's eye.<br /><br />One of the characters talks about marrying the heroine in the middle of December.  That was a huge mistake on the part of the author.  At that time in history, the Church of England did not allow weddings during Advent.  If a person is going to write historical fiction, get the facts correct.<br /><br />Another inexcusable mistake, at least to my mind, was thefact that the author has Great Aunt Eliza using knitting needles to darn a stocking.  Really.  This disgusted me.  One uses knitting needles to knit the stocking.  One uses a sewing-like needle to darn.  If you don't actually know how to do something, don't make assumptions.  Take the time to find out.  Not to do so is sheer laziness on the part of the author and I won't allow them to get away with it.<br /><br />These two errors really rang in my mind.  I am theologically trained Episcopalian who has studied the history of my denomination from its roots in England.  And I am a knitter.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Everything in this album is really amazing. I waited one month to get it and it's finally with me. I love it.
B00822KWME|5.0|Love the new re-packaging from this great cd. 4 cd's in one jewel case, which has some classic ol' Fleetwood Mac before Lindsey took this band to new heights. Lot of the songs from tusk and rumours are here which dominate this box set as well as few after Lindsey left. Plus 1 cd dedicated to the pre Lindsey era.
B00B0D29E6|5.0|Best Deep Purple ablem ever! Has so many great songs on it. Loved it back then and still do. Great!!
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|The character studies and human interaction in this series are top shelf. I have seen few others that equal the sheer intensity. If you watch the series and are honest you will see yourself somewhere.  This is my all time favorite series and I hope it lasts for many years.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|LOVED It! Story was Great and Henry Cavill is so Hot!!! I can't wait for next Superman Movie:) Great Movie!
0062238868|5.0|American Sniper is a very powerful, very real account of the life and experiences of a man who is widely considered to be the best sniper in U.S. military history. Kyle tells his story of his service in the U.S. Navy as a SEAL, more specifically a sniper in Iraq from several weeks after the 9/11 attacks, up to his discharge in 2009. Having a unique war story told from a member of one of the most elite and secretive military units in the world makes for a very exciting experience. And combined with Kyle's exploits in the Middle East, the book also focuses on his relationship with his wife and children while he was oversees, a very familiar concept many veterans will recognize. And at the beginning of the book, it is shown exactly how and why Chris joined the military, and became a SEAL specifically. All in all, this is one of my new favorite novels and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the SEALs, the war in Iraq, or the life of &#34;America's most lethal sniper&#34;. Finally, even though Kyle has passed away since the release of his life story, he still lives on as an American hero.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Stayed up way too long, all night to be exact, reading until I fell asleep with my face in my book. Buy it. The series is so much better than the movies.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Strange, strange, strange.  But I really do love this crazy slow paced movie.  Too bad Roman Polanski turned out to be such a jerk.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages. The whole family likes the app and I recommend it to children or adults.
1419819100|5.0|My package came ahead of schedule and is in great condition. I am a very satisfied customer and my son will be very happy to get this for Christmas
B006LSZECO|4.0|I bought this book because of all the hype, but it didn't live up to that in my opinion. It was a good book, and not really as predictable as you might think, but it wasn't worth the price to me. It was still good, though.
1400095204|3.0|Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a very well-educated writer from Nigeria.  Her novel Half of a Yellow Sun is a great piece of historical fiction that serves to highlight many different instances of the war between Biafra and Nigeria.  This includes giving examples of the tensions that existed between social and economic classes and what happened when fighting finally broke out.<br />The Biafran war effort itself was also another topic that was covered in her novel.  This coverage ranged from the propaganda which the Biafran side used, to the conscription of child soldiers.  The Nigerian side was also much more well equipped than Biafra and this was definitively evident in the readings.<br />Another important aspect of the book is how Chimamanda focused on the importance of telling the story of several different characters instead of just one.  This way the story of the war between Biafra and Nigeria was told from the perspectives of African men, women, children and even gave a European perspective to the events as well.<br />Although this book was not very graphic, it is still very well-written and definitely leaves a mark on the reader.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. Stayed up way too long, all night to be exact, reading until I fell asleep with my face in my book. Buy it. The series is so much better than the movies.
B008MM9630|4.0|The only draw back in this game is you do not earn enough crystals to purchase . I am at a point where I have to spend money to finish my quests. Am at level 44 and this is my third time of restarting to try different options. If crystals were easier to earn I would up this to a five star.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Loved loved loved this book. It was a little bit predictable, but not so much that it isn't still engrossing. I was on the edge of my seat, so to speak, the entire time I was reading.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like this app. So far I've had it for five days. It's performed pretty well once I found the right ringtone. It's pretty easy to use. Haven't had any problems with it. I'm satisfied with the app.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is an addictive game, I love that it was free and enjoyed it. Just wish I could have played it longer

B00GH4R95C|2.0|Disjointed and uninteresting rendition of the franchise.  Jumps around and never really makes any sense.  Watching two invincible guys slug it out and destroy a city is cartoonish at best, and boring overall.  Save your money, not worth it.  Get it on Redbox for a buck.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Pi Patel, unfortunately named after a pool, is a peculiarly devout boy growing up in India. His family consider themselves to be &#34;Modern Indians&#34; preferring to put their faith in Business than in God; his practises are unorthodox to his preachers and perplexing to his family. The shifting of politics in India, force Pi's father to make the decision to sell off the zoo he owned and operated, and emigrate to Canada, beginning Pi's miraculous journey across the Pacific. After the cargo ship, transporting Pi's family and animals goes down, Pis is left stranded on a lifeboat with his belief in a higher power and a dangerous Bengal tiger...<br /><br />I don't consider myself agnostic or atheist, but I'm not traditionally religious... My parents aren't religious, they didn't take me to church or instruct me on what we believed; I was left to make my own conclusions about the world as I saw fit. I grew up believing in the power of books above all else; books that were meant to teach and books that were meant to entertain, not that either were always mutually exclusive. I worshipped in libraries and bookstores, in school cafeterias and in my own backyard; as someone who's got her own ideas about God, I loved the message this book sent out. &lt;i>&#34;I just want to love God,&#34;&lt;/i> Pi responds, when confronted by a priest, a pandit, and an imam, who tell him there is no such thing as a practising Hindu-Christian-Muslim, and he must choose only one. How can you not love Pi just a little for defying religious conventions that have sparked so many wars?<br /><br />Over and over Pi's faith is tested by another recurring theme: The primal need to survive. Pi's been a vegetarian his whole life and now, lost at sea with an animal that is willing to kill to survive and a limited stash of food and water, Pi's going to have to make some tough decisions. In order to keep the tiger from viewing Pi as a potential meal, he has to establish himself as an Alpha and a Provider. That means being more aggressive than the 450-lb cat that threatens his life and ultimately, learning to kill.<br /><br />I love the metaphors Algae Island offers; Algae Island is a floating island of algae that grows trees to harvest sunlight, has plentiful fresh water pools that poison saltwater fish, and is overpopulated by mindless meerkats... Here on the island, Pi and Richard Parker find everything they need, it's a literal paradise. There's edible greens for Pi and meat for Richard Parker. There's plenty of freshwater and protection from the harsh elements. I can't help seeing a metaphorical Eden at this point in the story. The meerkats -- Pi notes they originate from Africa, while I note Africa as the known birthplace of humanity -- are content living in their mysterious floating garden. Its only when Pi's curiosity becomes too much to bear and he plucks a strange fruit from a strange tree, that he realizes he can't stay on the island forever. He and Richard Parker must leave and never return.<br /><br />And of course, now we hit the one flaw in the book. The abrupt transition between being lost at sea and making landfall in Mexico. They're at sea--and then they're not. I suppose there is some kind of mirror there, something to be said about the abrupt goodbye to the ocean and the abrupt disappearance of Richard Parker... Pi will eventually be questioned about the loss of the cargo ship and his journey. The officials think his story is a tragic lie, invented to cover up trauma from the actual tragedy. In response Pi tells them another story, more brutal than the first and asks them to sort out for themselves which one they prefer, which one is truth. I won't lie here; the very last paragraph of the book made me cry a little.<br /><br />Ps. It should be noted that the Author's Note is part of the storyline...Just incase you want to read the book and you're a AN-Skipper.eans being more aggressive than the 450-lb cat that threatens his life and ultimately, learning to kill.<br /><br />I love the metaphors Algae Island offers; Algae Island is a floating island of algae that grows trees to harvest sunlight, has plentiful fresh water pools that poison saltwater fish, and is overpopulated by mindless meerkats...

0545615402|5.0|These books are gorgeous.<br /><br />They are seriously so pretty that I kind of hate to touch them.<br /><br />I have the first versions of all of the books, but I didn't bat an eye buying these because they look so much classier. They look like something Harry, Ron, and Hermione would actually carry to class.
0671454625|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I don't know how anyone survived the conditions the author described. This should be required reading in every classroom in America.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am extremely satisfied right from the door with this app. I am pretty internet savvy, but when it comes to this stuff, I am without a clue. All I can say is, my Kindle Fire HD is 1.8 GB lighter. Using only one finger. All in one place. I would say that deserves 5 stars. If, in the future, I find any flaws, I will definitely add an update.
B00EDUTGB2|5.0|This is a very handy app for printing to my home printer, even when I'm home in the next room.  What takes this app over the top for me is that I can also print to my home printer even if I'm hundreds of miles from home as well.  It ties in nicely with my &#34;OfficeSuite Professional&#34; and prints any of my OfficeSuite documents.  It's also compatible with my other apps ... from email to my Bible study app.  My home printer is an HP Photosmart D110 and this app contains all the functionality for this printer.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I loved this book.  Well written, an unusual plot and lots of action.  Would have loved it even more if it had not seemed so rushed - more time taken to develop the characters and the scenes would have been great.  But all in all, a well written book - so unusual in this day and age- and unique.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Mesmerizing, painful, gut wrenching, beautifully written.<br />Compelling and haunting story that will keep you rapt.  Truly a gorgeous masterpiece. I wouldn't call it &#34;entertaining&#34;..it was &#34;consuming&#34;.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Really nice but scroll wheel came a bit messed up, not a big problem just annoying when it falls out of place.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|The good, the bad, the ugly, the real.  I loved the unvarnished, honest approach.  No sugar-coating here, Raw experiences.<br />Not just a travel/hiking memoir, it is a rough and tumble trip through Cheryl's wounded psyche and her path forward.  I'll be interested to see the movie coming out with Reese Witherspoon!<br />Really good read.  No fluff here.
B001P06GX4|5.0|It is a fun game.  Everybody loves it.  I have one and bought this one as a gift.  I would recommend to anyone.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|On the fence on this one.  Certainly engaging, a quick read.  I've no issues with the subject matter at all, so perhaps that is why it didn't shock or leave me dismayed.<br />Good beach read, or for a rainy day on the couch.<br />The writing style was just a little commercial for my taste, as though the author anticipates writing the screenplay.  It is sure to soon be a tv or film version, mark my words.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|Love the game but don't buy it on Amazon unless you have a Kindle. Wont show up on my Nexus 7 or SG2 after searching Google it appears it only works with the Kindle which is not listed in the description.
B00A861QMM|5.0|I got the free version.  Too short. Super fun though.  Not sure if I'll pay to get the full version.  Wish there were free full games like this.  Good game.
1423101502|5.0|A good book in a great series.<br />I'm not going to go off on a long, arrogant book review like some people.<br />If you like fantasy stuff, or if you've read the rest of the series, you should like this book.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|Robert Downey and Val Kilmer have excellent chemistry together in this film. Its a noir mystery with a few twists. Really all you need to do is sit back and enjoy. This is what entertainment film is supposed to be like.

B005I547ZG|4.0|Good, but too short and not complex to compete with Connelly's novels. Recommended as a foretaste for a tentative reader who'd like to get to know Harry Bosch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this game.it gives them a chance to show off their creativity.its also very addicting though. Great app.
B0001I561E|1.0|This is a wonderful film, and many people would love to own a copy of their own. Unfortunately, people will take advantage of this and produce counterfeit copies and sell them to online stores. The sellers don't know they are selling an illegal copy of a film, and unless someone notices it, both the seller and customer will get screwed. There are some ways to tell if your copy is a fake:<br /><br />1. Check the bottom of the disc- The originals have a bar-code, while the fakes only have the name of the film and the number of the disc.<br />2. Check for several typos: &#34;Sidesplitting comedy and soaring adventure.&#34; - The Original Aladdin back cover.<br />&#34;Sidesplitting comedy and soaning adventure&#34;- Fake DVD back cover.<br />3. The text will look off (it will be in the wrong font ect.)<br /><br />Look out for these signs, and you will be more likely to find your &#34;Diamond in the Rough&#34;
B0070Y46UY|4.0|At first it was hard to get into, but once in, it kept me reading more.  The story was engaging, well written with just the right amount of humor at the oddest times. I was surprised to find myself drawn to the zoo insights, and the depth of personal spirit under extreme duress.  Just when I thought I had &#34;figured it out&#34; the ending twisted and has left me re-thinking several passages of the book.  Well done!  It is not a story I will soon forget and am glad I took the time to read it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. When I heard that everyone else was playing I wasn't into it at all. I started playing 2 months ago and really love.  I can't wait to get home from work and play it all day long. I even play it on my lunch break but have to be careful cause I get stuck in the game and forget I'm at work. I recommend this game for everyone. It's very addictive and I love it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This is an excellent program--good production values, believable characters, interesting plots.  It doesn't necessarily break new ground, but it's a very good example of a known genre.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is pretty neat with all its drops it gives many customizations even for the same class types one can go dos one can go dog and so on<br /><br />If your looking to waste some good I recommend this app if you like fighting waves of enemies<br /><br />The only con I've experienced is the constant loose of connection while online<br /><br />Other than that is all fine and dandy<br /><br />Get it now and add me!<br /><br />SolBlade 45
B00FY9JJYA|4.0|Perhaps the most innovative jazz artist working today Robert Glasper layers musical genres the way Jean Michel Basquiat layers paint.  With the improvisatory elements of the jazz idiom as a foundation Glasper draws broad strokes with the vibrant colors of hip hop, neo soul, and poetic verse.  His approach is fearless as he blends diverse musical forms to create a new jazz vanguard that honors the best of the past while it embraces the creative spirit of contemporary black music.  The brother is a musical mixologist of the highest order.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app! Great for people who like to shape things the way they want! Also includes the main characterters!!! PLEASE DOWNLOAD FOR FREE!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this games is perfect for me and what else is perfect for me is the Tv show Mr.young on netflix
B005HSL626|5.0|Really Addicting! easy to jump into a game! Sounds goods all around fun game! Would recommend to my friends! 5 STARS
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Sealed deck play is a nice addition to the series. Unfortunately, it's crippled by the very limited number of booster packs you can earn per deck and you're limited to two sealed deck slots and have to pay for additional slots. lame. Also the game tends to randomly crash at the end of some matches.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|You should have a great time playing the new real steel. ENJOY!!!!!! FOR AMAZON YOU SHOULD CONSIDER YOUR COINS FOR IN-app purchases
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is just one excellent, excellent, show.  It supercedes  by far every other show on TV, cable and everything else.
B005DNPJKU|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> is there a cure for me??? hella yes... every scene he looks better and less horrific and they were sposed to use the exact cast of his head, oh well, prolly could not handle that makeup chair for 10hrs daily... could not quite determine why the &#34;Owner's&#34; Bread n Butter&#34; would require a paying customer to travel through a labyrinth of a quagmire of twists n turns to possibly view the creature, felt like this is exactly the type of trip I took throughout this film with each horrific treatment of this tragic gentlemen.. not sure why we had to endure all this harsh cruelty, was not the unfathomable dis-figuration enough to satisfy? can certainly relate to the kindness of strangers but seemed so disjointed, like HEY I am getting points for being really kewl to gift a signed pic of myself? I just knew that completed abbey was going to get it's due as we kept getting scenes of the progression of beauty kept getting destroyed at every turn... the pillow removal scene was just overbearing, 4 maybe but 8?? absolutely have compassion for someone in this condition and cannot appreciate enough how hard life is when I complain of my 5lb weight gain over the holidays... perspective was most profoundly appreciated... adored Anthony's performance especially, very handsome lad agree Mr. Stone! so recommend for the makeup reveals, Anthony fans, and oh yes that gorgeous theatre!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|An eye opener of how the food industry operates. It is time we take charge and learn more of what we are eating
B008MG1E4A|5.0|very good , I'm 14 and I loved the book. Makes me want to be a NAVY SEAL . Loved it.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I am a complete fan of the show and just ordered the second season.  And the music.  And Bombshell music.  That should about do it for now!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I chose this book after hearing the author's interview on NPR and read it as a read aloud to my 11 year old.  The book was fabulous - beautifully written, with dialogue so true to the age of the characters and the family dynamic.  The difficult subject of Auggie's facial anomaly was handled sensitively but so frankly and realistically.  I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham again, puts you into this new book.  This book is totally John Grisham at his best.  Never read one of his books that was not the best.  The Plot is super and the ending so unpredictable and gratifying as well.  Excellent read...don't miss it!!
B00CPLGFM4|5.0|Just used on of these in a build for my wife's grandmother, and it worked great.  A wonderful option for systems that don't need dedicated graphics for gaming, computer art, etc.  Speedy and efficient.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|Amateurish writing. Poor character development. Filled with cliches. Tiresome. I have read some decent .99 books but this isn't one of them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the app it allows me to view load and share photos. Also find some cool ideals.<br />I definitely recommend this app to anyone.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really liked this book.  It did a great job of answering all the questions left by the previous two books, a great end to the trilogy!
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Vonnegut at his best; he makes you laugh and think at the same time. Only Twain was able to do that as well. Good read that you will want to share.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great book, so many twists and turns.  I've now read 3 Gillian Flynn books and can't wait for more.
B00CF0VGUG|5.0|It's inspiring to know how hard a man Iggy's age can ROCK! Outstanding! This is great stuff from icons of rock!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Incredible story, I can't wait to start Mockingjay! Even as an adult I find the stories exciting and sad. An interesting perspective on war.
B006S08RLU|5.0|The story is about an exceptional young woman living among a quirky cast of characters. It is quintessentially French, but speaks to the oddities found in human nature everywhere. it's both charming and poignant. I bought it after watching it with my brother, because it is one of those movies I'll watch again and again.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I loved this book i probably would not of read this if it was not for my eal teacher<br /> You must read this
0375842209|2.0|As a writer, there are so many ways I am offended by the amateurish tricks used by the author of The Book Thief to create one long pretension.<br /><br />*** What I Didn't Like About The Way This Was Written ***<br />1. I have a wide and deep collection of rejection notices from when I was young, when I thought this kind of drivel was cool, experimental, rebellious.<br />2. I even have some rejection notices where the rejector went out of his/her way to note just how amateurish these kind of tricks are.<br />3. Lestendlich (which means \\"finally\\" in German, I think, I could be a little off with the true sense of \\"finally\\"), I recall getting bad grades from my 8th Grade English teacher for writing this king of drivel, like stories narrated by Death.<br />4. I don't write that way any more.<br />5. Haven't for many, many decades.<br /><br />But all snarkiness aside, there are many bad reviews of The Book Thief that focus on the childish literary devices and overtt emotional manipulation, but I have yet to see one that makes the most important point, the greatest offense offered up by this nonsense.<br /><br />*** WARNING ***<br />1. I am about to tell you an important fact.<br />2. I am sorry to give it away so soon, but it is too important and I have too little respect for you to try to work it into the narrative in a less pretentious manner.<br />3. I am, after all, DEATH.<br />4. But it is important.<br /><br />Yes, I am the son of holocaust survivors. Maybe I'm more sensitive to this than others. But The Book Thief goes completely beyond the pale in casting the villains as victims, without ever attempting to dig into the reasons why an entire nation sat by and allowed such an extraordinary genocide to take place.<br /><br />*** I ADMIT IT ***<br />1. The Hubermanns helped hide a Jew.<br />2. Rudy liked Jesse Owens.<br />3. One or two old ladies make nasty remarks about Jews.<br /><br />Beyond that, nothing. No hint that -- not wishing their fate upon anyone -- THEYSTARTED IT! They sat by and let it happen. Hans regrets the pangs of conscience that kept him from being accepted to the Nazi party, because it damaged his business. He can't understand why he is not being punished for trying to help a Jew, so he punishes himself -- is this totally lost on everyone who liked this book? He cuts the Jew loose to face near-certain death to save himself and his family from Nazi retaliation -- that never even happens!<br /><br />To lay the entire blame on Hitler, and to disingenuously blame Hitler's oratory, and not take into account that an entire nation ate it up and executed his vision, that's OFFENSIVE. And it's just plain wrong.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|This watch is quite stylish and it keeps great time. I love that it is mechanical and needs no batteries.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love this book and this series. I can't wait to read the 3rd book. I would recommend this book to everyone.
0307716988|5.0|I don't where to start? It took me three days to finish this, and I was completely blown away. I'm only 15 and I'm blown away. This book Michael wrote somehow clearly reflected on my own life. I love his advice about learning to carry on goals. I loved how he explained easily how fame was for him. Now, one these reviews stated that \\"it was like Michael was actually sitting in the room with you.\\" I have to say I highly agree with that! I heard his voice! I saw his pictures it was an amazing experience. I for once actually felt like I got to know him! I never met him before in reality, but this is as close I could get. This is a definite MUST READ!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Absolutely love this game. I play it on my phone too. It does have trouble l r loading it a lot but it's still a really totally awesome game.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|The movie is my favorite movie.  The movie I received has a huge scratch completely across the DVD. Could not watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love playing this game or just watching the minion coo, jump and move around sends them into giggle fits.
B00C1040TO|5.0|What an amazing app. I only use it for the tuner but it has a bunch of other cool features too. It's worth it just for the amazing tuner though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I like  this book a lot. I sorta liked it's tragic but still meaningful ending. I think it was fantastic. So ,I would like to thank my mother for making me read it.<br /><br />- Eva, age 11
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|The ending was too strange.  I didn't know it had ended.  It dragged a little.  Was a little hard to follow.
0307887448|5.0|If you grew up in the 80s, liked pop culture, and played video games, this is the book for you. Recommended to me by my girlfriend a few months back, I picked it up and could not put it down. I rate this as one of my favorite books of all time. Cannot recommend it enough.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I reread this book as well as Catching Fire. I think that I gained more understanding after doing it. I am glad to have shared this intriguing tale of survival and growth in spite of the price that the character's paid for in seeing that the Hunger Games were ended.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works well on my Kindle.  That's all I need to manage my mail so I can access my messages at any time.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a series of stories that keeps one interested. Going from a simple story to be written into the lives of 2 entirely different people with lives that were complete opposites. Into  stories of true interest. It differently lets one know that one never knows what goes on behind a homes closed doors. The movie shall be quite interesting to see.
B004I744AS|5.0|So much information, all in one place. Use it several time a day, everyday.<br />The best dictionary style app available.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|What a wonderful story, very well written. I thoroughly enjoyed this. There was drama, love, sex! My favorite combinations and no cliffhanger!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Craig Johnson's characters come to life in the Longmire series.  I originally decided to read The Cold Dish because I enjoyed the TV series, but I found that the books (as usual) have an entirely different dimension that the show doesn't.  The characters are fuller and the story is better, but watch out, they are addictive.
B00EPFEY44|2.0|This album featured the same songs as  his previous album; frankly, I feel gipped.  The songs were great--the first time!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book.  I felt like I was in the story.  Very complelling.  You may not agree with the characters's choices, but you understand their dilemmas and have empathy for them all.  Quite a good writer that can do that!
B008JFUS28|4.0|The special effects are amazing, attractive and gigantic.<br /><br />The action is non-stop. Yet, 45 minutes into the movie, the excitement substantially subsides. It's because Thor's fighting skills look very limited. He whacks the enemies with his hammer; he flies; he throws punches; he slams his body against the opponents. That's all. It's repetitive to the point of boring after watching those scenes for a while.<br /><br />Adding to the problem above, there's very little character depth. The film barely touches brotherhood and father-and-son relationship.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, as of today, Dec. 12, 2013, below are the financial figures of this movie:<br /><br />Release Date: Nov. 8, 2013<br />Production Budget: $170 million<br />Domestic:  $194,618,631<br />+ Foreign:  $416,700,000<br />= Worldwide:  $611,318,631<br /><br />So far,it took in 441 million dollars more than its production cost. That's an enormous amount.<br /><br />In short, it's certainly worth watching once.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Seems to me this book addresses the internal issues around many  life  undertakings that  require courage to be oneself.  I thoroughly  enjoyed its sensitivity and honesty.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|An easy Sci-fi read. Very likeable characters and a good plot. I would recommend for anyone who likes the genre.
B006IGZX0C|4.0|this is a feel-good story which encourages compassion for the hired help several decades ago.  It makes you realize the strides that have been made in racial equality over the years.  But there were many wonderful ways of life back then to be appreicated.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The benefit of the extra length enable me to use the kindle at my families house without any problems reaching the back of the television. Thank you so much. It works great.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|If you are a fan of Allie's blog, or even if you've never read it, this book is great.  It's funny, it's touching, it's sometimes serious, but all delivered in an expressively sketched way.  Overall a really enjoyable book.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|In the book Bad luck and trouble, by Lee Child, has a very strong presence of friendship and loyalty in it. Jack Reacher, retired major in the Military Police, walks aimlessly from town to town with a tooth brush, ATM card, and his passport. He reaches a bank to find that exactly $1,030.00 was deposited from an outside source. He recognizes that this is a 10-30 code from his days as an MP which stands for emergency. He finds that this 10-30 came from one of his old team members, Francis Neagley, with news that Calvin Franz, another team member, has just been murdered and Jorge Sanchez, Tony Swan, and, Manuel Orozco are missing somewhere in L.A. Reacher must travel to California to meet with Neagley before she too disappears. It is up to<br />Reacher and Neagley to try and reach Karla Dixson and David O’Donnel possibly the last remaining members of their old team still alive. Can’t miss moments include the moment the team understand what the big picture is, who the killer and accomplices are, and just the bond the team builds after being broken apart for so long.<br /><br />  The best symbol i can think of to describe this book two hands combined into one. The same bond we make with only few individuals in our entire lives our best friends, our brothers and sisters as some may call them, but none the less stand by our side as we stand along theirs. It’s a bond stronger then we could ever fathom and that is what this book is all about. Standing by that person’s side when they need you most for anything and everything.<br /> This book appeals to anyone who loves a good suspenseful thriller, with witty jokes between friends that anyone can relate to, along with plot and story twist that keep you on the edge of your seat.  I rate this book 4.5 out of 5 stars because of how well the author combined and intertwined so many different themes just created a master piece of a book.<br /><br />Main characters include: Jack Reacher, Karla Dixson, Francis Neagley, David O'Donnel, Curtis Mauney, and Margret Brenenson (&#34;dragon lady&#34;)'Donnel, Curtis Mauney, and Margret Brenenson (&#34;dragon lady&#34;)
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart. Sharp. Funny. The two leads played excellently off one another. Kudos to a number of the supporting cast as well. This was very enjoyable.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Simple, yet oh so challenging and addictive. Clever match 3 game that keeps you challenged. A fun diversion that can be played in short spurts of time, like waiting in the dmv or in a shopping line.
B005KIQDYE|5.0|What girl doesn't love the new Friends sets?  It's just perfect although I wish they had some that were a little tougher to complete.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Held my interest and I also wish it had been just a bit longer. Can't wait to try the next one.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Best album ever.  I can't stop listening to this.  I can't decide which CD is better.  I love having the lyrics too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a terrific story with something special for everyone.  Racial relations. Family will contests. Trial lititgation. As a former trial lawyer this had particular appeal to me. Although not as long the estate trial in Dickens'  Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, this court trial was just as ultimately significant and far more dramatic.  The only criticism I had is technical.  A certain amount of evidence in the trial was inadmissible according to the Mississippi Dead Man's statute.  I'm sure the author knew that but used his poetic license to ignore it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun my head is always looking Down at the screen it's still awesome if your not sure to buy this app and waste your money  your wrong you should totally get t this app.:)
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Can anybody tell me if the blurays on this boxed set are region 0 (or free) or are they encoded just for region 1?<br />I live in Italy and I need to know if I can watch these on my bluray player.<br />Thanks!
B00C1040TO|5.0|Sadly, (and quite shockingly happy) this is one of the most accurate tuners I have ever used....seriously. I have several different in-line and built in guitar tuners and this app blew them away. We even tested it against a constant tone on YouTube and it measured it perfectly. The metronome is easily adjusted manually, or has incremental presets to scroll through for tempo, and you can manually adjust beats per measure and subdivision. I could do without the flashing background while the metronome is playing, but I can see it's usefulness when you aren't able to hear the beats (this feature can be turned off in settings). Recording is quite simple, press the RECORD button and a dialog box appears, press Start Recording, make noise, press RECORD again to stop. You are then prompted with a small window to playback by pressing the pink play icon, Share, or Cancel. There is also a trash icon to delete your recordings. Once a recording is made, it will be displayed in the pop-up box after you press the RECORD icon again. Great little app and I would highly recommend.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|GREAT APP, NUMBERS ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO SEE AND ALL THE OTHER INFORMATION DISPLAYED IS HELPFUL. GET THE WEATHER INFO RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS/
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A story that is difficult to stop reading. A beautiful and remarkable story of Death and friendship and love and life. This book helps to put in a unique perspective history of Germans who were not all haters of Jewish peoples but instead were sometimes oblivious to what WWII was about... at least for a little while.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|I ENJOYED THE MOVIE WITH AN ADULT TWIST.  IT WAS ACTION PACKED AND A GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT MOVIE TO WATCH WITH FRIENDS.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I can not wait to read the last volumes. I have a very hard time putting the pad down! Bravo!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I DOWNLOADED SO THAT I COULD TAKE PICTURES WITH MY KINDLE BUT IT'S BEEN A LITTLE HARD SINCE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHAT YOUR SNAPPING A PICTURE OF.
B000W4KT64|5.0|My daughter loves this movie like no other! She is a dancer and knows all the moves to this movie! She love love loves this movie (she's 6).
B008J05EL8|1.0|THIS DIDN'T WORK AND I WISH I COULD GET MY COINS BACK TO SPEND ON SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK FOR ME!!!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys non-fiction.  Very interesting at all times.  I've already recommended this book to many others.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Love Barbara, and ALL that she does.  Nice compilation of Christmas music by Barbara, and another beautiful addition to my collection.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|awesome read!! i could not put it down. especially loved that the chapters are written from the 2 main characters' POV. great book.
B008Y729FU|5.0|Years ago, there was a TV show about The Crow that I saw on a sporadic basis, and which I enjoyed very much. It was great fun watching the movie and seeing the whole and complete story at one time. Not a light-hearted movie, though there are moments of great fun. I didn't realize until the end that Mr. Lee had died during the filming of the movie, so at whatever point they brought the gentleman in to finish the movie, it went seamlessly.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book. I felt inspired while reading. This is the ultimate underdog story. It's for every kid that was ever bullied. Read this book asap.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Free, but has glitches that cause my kindle fire to freeze up and need a reboot.  Still worth it.  The read aloud in different translations is my favorite feature.
B00G32OER4|3.0|This was only okay. I felt there was mostly a push to get a jump out of the audience, which never happened while I watched this. I've read the first book of the oldest daughter who lived in this home and also have had her on my blog talk radio show. There are somethings that are supposed to be true events, but most of this was made up or over dramatized for the movie.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for a good B movie horror, I wouldn't pass this one up. I just don't feel it is one of the best either. Would I watch it again, maybe. Would I seek the movie out to watch...most likely not.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is so many ideas, and you can copy someone's world!How to copy someone's world:  ( you won't see the creations other players made)Ask the player to hit edit on the main screen. Ask them to scroll down to the world you want. The player will see the seed. When you hit New hit the bar under the word seed. The player will tell you what the seed is. Now you type that seed in,  name the world hit generate world. Now you have that world! Great job!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|there is a problem with all of gameloft games for me it makes me download the files,I guess the files don't download but can you
0525953728|5.0|Good reading.  I love getting in the action through a book, but I can't imagine what the troops go through every day as they never know where their enemy will show up.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Personally I found this game fun and very addicting. I totally recommend going through all stages with all the levels.
0399161287|5.0|I knew Mike Tyson has had a rough life, but this book is...grueling. I had not idea just how gritty his life has been,. But I also found the book well worth reading. Just as he did in the ring, Iron Mike pulls no punches in documenting his life - the rough upbringing that led to a life of petty crime, the father figure he never had found in Cus D'Amato, the terrible manipulations of Don King, and most of all the inner demons that Tyson tried (and often failed) to exorcise time after time. Tyson seems to have matured quite a bit as of this writing, which is great to witness, and his words actually carry a very authentic wisdom. The writing is compelling - I read this in just two sessions. It's not for everybody, some people probably won't like it (or won't be able to stomach it), but this book is exactly as advertised: Undisputed Truth.
B006QV30JU|5.0|A very sweet rendition of a lovely musical. Of course, anything with Gene Kelly is for me.<br /><br />P.S. I just appeared in a production of the stage version (playing the father of the bride).
B00F031X62|5.0|The is one of the best live Jimi Hendrix releases yet. The sound quality is outstanding, particularly for a recording from 45 years ago (hard to believe it's been that long). The mastering is gorgeous. And the performance itself is stunning. The band is tight, with Mitch and Noel grooving along with Jimi's one-of-a-kind guitar playing. Not a bad track on the disc. It's hard to pick the &#34;best tracks&#34; from a disc this good. I guess I would say that &#34;Fire&#34; and &#34;Hey Joe&#34; are stand-outs, but the other tracks are amazing as well. A sonic boom from 1968. Enjoy!
B001BANK32|4.0|It's as classic King as you can get! I actually re-read it as the prelude to Dr.Sleep. I had forgotten how much better than the movie the book was!
B000001F26|4.0|This is a really good compilation of Eric Clapton's most famous tracks. The sound quality is adequate while not outstanding - these are not remasters if you're curious about that. I would have included a few other tracks - notably Let It Rain. But it's a pretty decent set of EC's work. Good for the price, and a good introduction to his work if you need that or want to introduce someone else to some of his masterpieces.
B00G70WLJA|4.0|Much better than the first Wolverine movie. Definitely worth watching for a Marvel or X-men fan. The plot is a little weird at times but makes up for it by the end. The fight scenes are some of the best yet in xmen franchise and it leaves off where Days of Future Past will pick up next year.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|grabs your attention on the first page and holds it to the end. I need to know more about the rest of her life.<br />luannderikart

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love it when Stephen King continues with, or brings back a character he has introduced us to before.  This was one of his very best novels.  Some writers can just get right into your imagination and even go far beyond that, Mr. King is one of those people.  The stories he creates are far better than my imagination could ever be on its own.
0345803485|1.0|Ok I have one big question. Well there are more but lets start with one. You can get published with such crap?? Wow I always thought you need to have a minimum standard. I read books on wattpad.com, and teenagers there write so much better than this crap. Top of ny list??<br /><br />Next question. How is this electrifying women across america?? How can it make your sex life better?? How on earth could you feel sexy after reading this crap?? Really?? I dont know anything about this bondage sex stuff, but I am surprised that majority of women would like to be insulted, humiliated and demeaned to be aroused? Or is it just me?<br /><br />And why on earth would you compare THIS PILE of CRAP with the DA VINCI CODE? I wish i could sue the publisher and the author for ripping off people. And make things worse they are going to make it into a movie.<br /><br />I have read TWILLIGHT. I enjoyed it even though it is teen fiction, and this is 1000 times worse than that. I am sure I can write better than that.<br /><br />NOTE TO AUTHOR<br /><br />1. Next time you write up a book either use geography and culture you are familiar with or at least learn to use GOOGLE MAPS.<br /><br />2. Try to invent your own characters instead of copying from other books.<br /><br />3. Spend a lot more time on research to get at least your facts right if not anything else.<br /><br />4. Please buy a thesaurus or use the ones available online which are free.<br /><br />If anyone out there hasn't ever read a book in their life, then please by all means go ahead and read. Then you might find it as good piece of writing,
B00CH87HF4|2.0|This game is ok and not ok.<br /><br />First of all the game play. In game coins can pretty much only be used to upgrade weapons. You can't even buy potions or gear with it. Speaking of Potions you only get 3. Just 3, none in your inventory. Those potions take 2 hours to regenerate each. Second the crafting. I've realized that by the time i have enough to craft something I already have that item in possession. Plus you have to wait so long before you collect more than the one type of rock to craft with.<br />Overall the only upside to this game is just the length it'll take you to beat it.<br /><br />The way this game is set up, you need to use real world money for the in game things you want such as unlimited potions or the weapons you require. It's your choice but I'm sure many others have found this game is not worth the terrible amount of space it takes up.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|My husband ordered this for himself and I have heard no complaints. It arrived in what I thought was a cigar tube and it's heavy and big enough not to be clumsy in his hands. He loves it.
0767811070|5.0|There are a lot of unfortunate things around the world that people are not really aware of. For example: poverty, violence, crime, and calamities. The sad thing is that people are dying and people are living comfortably like they don't care about anything. What I hate is when people are whining why they cannot get a better live or a good life when they do nothing but become lazy. Little do they know that every second that they are complaining there are people dying. The movie Boyz N The Hood is a great movie because it makes people aware that the life of people who are less fortunate is not easy. Some people call this community \\"ghetto\\" and some people call it \\"hood.\\" Honestly I don't really know the difference or what they stand for. There are life lessons in this movie that people should really remember. One example is when Laurence Fishburne or in this movie he is known as \\"Furious.\\" He said an amazing line that got me saying damn. He said \\"any fool with a dick can make a baby, but only a real man can raise his children.\\" This quote right here is for everybody who is having sex with a lot of people not caring what can happen if the his girl gets pregnant. It is a sad fact, but a lot of men really do abandon their children or girlfriends the moment the men fight out that their girl is pregnant. They do not think about how hard is it for a woman to carry a baby for nine months with both physical and physiological challenges that goes with pregnancy. It is shameful, and it is tainting the reputation of our gender of being a \\"man.\\" To be a man is to be a fighter, and not to be a quitter. They have to own up from their mistakes and not to run away from them and to be a coward about it. Whenever I hear this movie, this is one of the first things that go into my head. It is one of the most significant lessons that people have to know. This movie over all is great because it wakes people up when it comes to things like crime and violence. It makes people aware that beingin the hood or ghetto, doesn't mean it makes them less of a human. These people in these communities, I should say, are strong. They live everyday with struggle, but they get through it. Crimes are all over the place, drugs, shooting, fighting, robberies, and abandonment of families, but they stand up and survive. They are human. They lose family almost every day, and they do not get the help nor the attention that they need, and some people look at them as just some low life people who they shouldn't even pay attention to. It is sad actually. I know what it is like to live a life with struggle. I know what it is like to be looked down to. That is why this movie is one of my favorite movies because I could honestly connect with it and remind me where I came from. Therefor I avoid making judgment about people just because of what they do and where they come from. The actors are great. They successfully fulfilled each and every role they were supposed to do, and they successfully connected with their audiences. Great movie, and I will always carry the lessons I got from this movie and apply it in my everyday life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addicting! I love this game and am addicted to it.  Can't get enough of Candy Crush! It's probably a good thing that you have to wait to earn more turns.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|A bunch of magicians set up to rob a bank.  The magic effects are not interesting or exciting, since we know it's all about film editing: With movie editing you can do anything at all; so we're not impressed.<br /><br />The protagonists are arrogant and unlikable.  The sound track is very noisy.  The stunts, of which there are many, are ridiculous and unbelievable.  There are a couple of plot twists that are mildly interesting.<br /><br />I like magic (see Penn and Teller Fool Us on Youtube for great tricks in front of a live audience) but this movie left me cold.<br /><br />Teenage boys might like this movie for all the mayhem; no one else will.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|My best friend turned me on to this on a recent trip.  We flew and had a lengthy layover and we played this and time flew by.  I highly recommend it to you mature folks.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|great movie esp. around Christmas; well edited<br />closed captioning finally started after about 45 minutes into the movie, so CC was out of sync by 45 minutes throughout the rest of the movie! - we had to turn CC off as it was worse than useless, it was distracting
B004G600A4|4.0|A great movie for younger kids. I like to have movies on hand for children.  This was a delightful movie.
B0008237BO|4.0|What to know what a thug thinks and feels than this is the cd for you.  Just like the first Makaveli 2puc was denounced.
B003UESJF6|4.0|I purchased it to have on hand for children.  It was an interesting movie and will share with other grandparents.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I consider myself a huge Stephen King fan.  I would consider this one of his better efforts and I've read nearly everything he has written.  It is head and shoulders above The Shining which I thought was very average.
B00CATSONE|5.0|From the first sentence to the last this book was fascinating and inspiring. it was recommended by my boss, and he was equally inspired.  One thing memorable to me was that the wealthy and unscrupulous can destroy a man of genius.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I picked up a Chromecast a couple of weeks ago and have fallen in love with it!  It just works, and I love the integration with my Nexus 4 and Chrome browser on my desktop and laptop.  I'll be canceling my cable soon and will probably get another one of these bad boys for the bedroom TV.<br /><br />Apple TV and Roku need to step up their game.  Chromecast beats them all to a pulp!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson is just plain good.  I love his country tone and this Bluegrass Album is fun to listen to.  If you like Alan Jackson you will like this Album.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game so much. At first I didn't think I was going to like it and I don't like it I live It. This game is so fun
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I found myself to be extremely disappointed<br />with Allegiant. After patiently  waiting for the third book of<br />the Divergent series. I was bored and felt I was reading a book<br />written in a complete different style. It was as if the writer found<br />herself trapped and pressure to come up with a resolution to a story last minute, instead of having had the<br />book series planned from the very begining.<br />In my opinion the book was anticlimatic and barely tolerable to finish<br />Thumbs down..
B005COO1X6|4.0|The yarn you can't put down, as only Stephen King can spin.  I will never pull into a rest stop again without feeling a bit uneasy..
B0089EHWQE|5.0|By the second chapter I was unable to put it down.  I was greatly moved by the story and totally bereft because I knew that no matter what the outcome, it would still be extremely sad, but I was compelled to find out what happens.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was like a rerun of a favorite movie.  Good, but more of the same. I was a little disappointed.
0307454541|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie which I normally don't like to do. I'm glad I did. Great read !
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|THE PERFECT PUZZLE GAME THAT APPEALS TO ALL PROBLEM SOLVERS.You will want to play it again and again. I would highly recommend it .
1582701709|5.0|I brought this book and put it down after the first time I read it. I didn't think about it again until someone at work was reading it in the waitingroom. We stuck up a conversation about it. So I reread it again and followed the instructions. I do believe it works and has had a very positive effect on my life.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book reads like it was written by another author. I know that Veronica Roth used her husband as a sounding board this time and she must have let him overwrite parts of it. The book is slow and not eventful and extremely political. The ending - really? Four is just going to ask his Mom to compromise and she is going to hug him and say &#34;Oh son, everything is all right and I will do what you want.&#34; It's a waste of money and time and I'm very unhappy with this book.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|It's been while since I've seen some of these performances and forgot how great some of them were.  Audio and video are great.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love the ability to be totally mobile with this program without taking up tons of space on my hard drive for the Microsoft office suite.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Now I know why this book is a classic. Read it along with the narrative and you will feel like one of the crew.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME - IT IS SO VERY ADDICTING - CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!  I PLAY IF OVER AND OVER AGAIN -YOU SHOULD TRY IT - GREAT  FUN FOR ALL
0385537131|5.0|A terrific book, a big book, lots of characters, lots of subplots, great evocation of The South--HOWEVER, Grisham fails to tie up all the loose ends. Fellow readers: what happened to Juror number 12, Doley? He was supposed to be &#34;trouble,&#34; remember? Funny how reading a great book, all you might remember is the untied loose end of a subplot. Nontheless, I gave Sycamore Road 5 big stars.
B004MKLRYC|5.0|Wonderful little book.  Funny, charming and just a fun read.  Everyone in my book club liked it and that's high praise indeed!<br />Sometimes we almost have fist fights! Well, not really because we're little old ladies.  But we're tempted...
B00371XIJE|5.0|I started crying the first five minutes.  I am iffy about watching things like this because I am so emotionally attached to dogs.  I knew from looking at the picture of the dog, I knew I am not going to finish the movie with dry eyes.  As I suspected, I sobbed horribly and my heart ache like a knife to the heart.  I love dogs and nothing will ever change that.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Wonderful movie. I don't purchase many movies as I rarely rewatch them, however, this movie is one that I watch over and over again with others that visit. Great message and it reminds me how important imagination is!
B0001YRVN4|1.0|Its been revamped...wanted the orignal version for my Son...this was his favorite series of all time...he's 35 years old...and still remembers going to the theater to see this...
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Anything that Joe Bonamassa does is worth the purchase. We love his music. He's one of the most talented guitarists we've found.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I only wish that this book were longer!  Neil Gaiman has never disappointed me and I eagerly await his next offering.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Bought this game because I thought it would be fun for my 8 year old but he lost interest in about 30 min.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I bought it because it was my book club's selection but I found it disappointing. I guess I'm not as much of s Tina Fey fan as I thought
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Is is fun I love to go fight bosses so much I built a house<br />I love his someone to help you it is cool that is dungeons<br />You mite want to download this game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|This was exactly as the description stated.<br />The packaging was in mint condition and the movie played flawlessly from both discs.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Very entertaining, I like the space stuff in a we are here to help you kind of way. It some times inspires people to create things.
B003VANOFY|4.0|*UPDATED July 2016* I purchased this headset for use on (6+ hour) conference calls. It works well. I can run into the other room, almost 100 feet away, to refill my cup or grab a snack without losing the conversation.  I have had to replace the battery and the ear pads once, but after using this for 3 years in Windows and Linux environments, the only downside that I have found is that the microphone is automatically unmuted if you lose your connection. When you wander out of range and then come back, or when you first turn the headset on, the microphone is unmuted -- even if the mic is up and the mute light is on. Had to dock a star for that.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|I'm not into the queer thing. If the lead person was not queer I think it wood had been a lot better.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|As an avid reader I was delighted to see another Donna Tartt book published.  WAY too long and dragged out. It was almost like two different authors were involved. The first author for about 2./3 of the novel and another for the end. If you really want to read, be prepared for a really downward spiral. I have spoken with others who have also read, and their reactions were exactly the same.
B003L0VJF6|5.0|I always knew Julia Fischer is a brilliant violinist, but I didn't know that she is an equally brilliant pianist. In fact, her performance of the Grieg is probably the finest I've ever heard. What an incredible musician!
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Great movie package with all the special features at a great price. I think that one reason this movie was not a bigger theatrical hit originally, was the cheesy poster/cover art. Too cartoonish,even for the 80's. It doesn't do the movie justice. Still, this package is , as Dr. Terrell would say, quite a prize.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|my favorite app. very good. I install it in my each device and use it everyday. I can not leave it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Didn't think I would like it and loved it .  It brings racing and life's lessons together.  Easy to read, couldn't put it down
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Decent movie...but not as spectacular as some of the older 007 movies. I felt some of the CGI effects looked cheesy
B0044KU7KU|5.0|This is a Great Cd-it just might be my favorite MCR album of all of them. I Received it in good condition.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|The show has some interesting characters, and decent action but predictable plots. I'm not really sure that the plot premise is sustainable but its worth watching an episode or two and see hopw it goes.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Bond? What can I say except action pact and beautifully made. I like that a big part of the movie was about M. I love the actress.
0385350864|3.0|Quite disappointing follow-up to much-loved earlier Bridget Jones novels.  The preoccupation with Twitter and Bridget's immaturity was surprising given her age.  The writing was more like a movie script and less like a novel.  It did get better in the last third of the book but I had eagerly anticipated reading it and was very disappointed.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This comes with a couple hundred puzzles ranging from easy to hard. If you like logic puzzles, get it- it's a great app.
B009APMNB0|4.0|It did a great job calibrating my new IPS monitor.  It was easy to use and seemed to have great results.  My only problem is when I tried to use it on my laptop, I couldn't get the software to work at all.  It says it works on multiple computers but I guess I just haven't figured out how yet.  It was a great buy and was worth it even if it only does my one monitor.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|One of the best games I've played on my tablet. Good artwork, good puzzle design, an all-in-all is just really fun.
B00DNUSG0U|5.0|Very happy with this purchase, love these movies and wanted to view them in blu ray! So happy to get a set of all the Tremors movies!

B00AEFY66U|5.0|I had not seen this film in years, it was better than ever.  Robert Redford was wonderful, I really appreciate<br />Amazon for having the older films.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Great version of non-traditional Christmas music performance.  Love it!  New to their music and will continue to put them at the top of my list.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best Stephen King book ever.  Loved it from beginning to end and hated finishing it.  Stephen King has been one of my favorite authors, even though I haven't enjoyed one of his books so much since Talisman or The Stand.  Highly recommended for someone who normally would not read Stephen King.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This is the best album of 2013 and that's like the only words I can come up with to review this cd because my mind is blown.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Brilliant about the issue of social medias and 1984 visions at the scariest possible way. AS litteratur it is not top notch, but ok
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played this o n facebook and really enjoyed it. I just downloaded the game to my kindle and haven't played  for an he and you w a noted a review. It could have been higher if given more time  ok I have played this daily and love it  the only prob I have is when I buy crowns I never get them but I have learned they let you earn them quit regularly

B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|I've been reading the 37signals blog for some time now and also their last book Rework. Remote is another great read and inspires you to go out and make remote work happen for you. This book truly adds great insight into how remote working can benefit the individual worker, as well as the company.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This CD is one that I enjoyed from the first track to the last.  Easy listening with a smile. I would recommend this CD.

159463176X|2.0|Left me with no satisfaction, no improvement in my life, nothing.  It was a book club recommendation and I don't have that kind of time to waste.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I was recommended to read this book . This is a great book whether you are in a new relationship or married.I wished I read it sooner. It gives you insight to relationships that I thought not possible.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Old Man's War<br />The few really negative reviewers seemed to have no interest in the elderly characters. I'm 58 with fifty years of SF of all stripes behind me... I thought it was splendid and was brought to loud chuckles repeatedly. Quick witted, glib, insightful. The humor thins out when one gets to the second act. I have no information on Mr. Scalzi, but I'm pretty sure he is a careful observer of the human condition. The editing was much better than average. Good pacing. Emphasis on characterization, though the space opera/military aspects are not overlooked, nor rudimentary. Not as dark as the Forever War or Starship Troopers. A bit more fun than Swarm. More easily approached than more mainstream Mil/Sci/Fi. If you liked On Basilisk Station, this will probably work for you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is fun for hours I love playing it and every level is a difforent challenge! I would recommend it to anyone who like a little bit of a brain teeser.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Great family movie. Teaches good lessons too. My five year old &#34;loved it&#34;. It's ends so nicely (not the usual sad mixed story ending). Very sweet movie....

B009NQZVKG|5.0|Oh my gosh!  This book was great!  Love all of James Rollins books, but particularly the Sigma Force Novels.  I couldn't put it down.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|This is a MUST READ for anyone seeking a plan for securing their financial future.  The book includes several stories and examples that illustrate the main message of the book: LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS!!!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|What a great album! Can't stop listening to it!! A must have if you are a die hard Stryper Fan!!
B00942G4UA|4.0|It opens your mind to how corporations control what appears on our plates!<br />Never realized they had this much power.  And of course the lack of integrity is frightening!<br />This documentary is a must see!
B000ZHBB0Q|4.0|i liked the movie. it is a classic. one to watch over and over. every one will enjoy this movie.
B00FHB7398|3.0|I love Big Fish games, I have been playing them for a good few years now. However, when I see the words Kindle Tablet Edition, alarm bells ring as it often means that a game has not been properly developed for the Kindle Fire. Web of Deceit is not an exception to this and how I wish I had heeded my instincts before handing over my precious coins. The game looks gothic and gorgeous, but the gameplay is painfully slow and after quite a short time playing, I just couldn't stand it anymore and deleted it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I must say E L James did her thing ...Great book two...a must must read...excited to read the third...let's go!!

0385751532|4.0|It was required for my grandaughter for English examination purposes. As such, it was wonderful, she found it absorbing but sad as I did.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a very good book for middle schoolers and adults. I love the way that they switch charator that narrate. Love this book so much I wish thre was a sequel.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|The worst movie of the year.  I can't believe the actors in this agreed to participate in this horrible script.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|absolutely love this game!!! I think I have a slight addiction Lol. the ONLY negative is how long it takes to regenerate lives
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|Despite being in the music industry for all of her life, Miley can be considered to be a new comer, since all her previous stuff was over shadowed by Disney, her managing company. And since she is no longer under that shadow, Miley has taken the reins of her career into her own hands leading it into superstardom. With this cd, she has sounded the horn and thrown the  gauntlet as a warning that she is here to stay and she will no longer be considered a teen idol. She is now in the arena of other pop divas like Adele, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Ninki Minaj and Britney Spears.Not that she sounds like any of these ladies, cause Miley undisputedly has a unique style and voice. She obviously has been listening to a diverse selection of music and has taken notes at what works.<br />I bought this cd out of curiosity, since I liked the songs \\"We cant stop\\" and \\"Wreaking Ball\\" and couldn't help following the twerking incident on the VMAs and all the controversy that followed.  But after hearing the cd, it has all fallen into place. Miley did not want to enter the spotlight from the side door unnoticed, she wanted to break down the front door holding everybody's attention, cause she knew she had a killer cd to drop. She is probably sitting back now, waving her VMAs finger at all the nay sayers.<br />Bangerz is a fun cd, not to be taken too seriously although their are some very personal and mature moments on it. Miley has mixed it up well, with RnB, Pop, Urban/Hip Hop, funk and a touch of country, showing her diversity.<br />Here are my takes on the songs in quick review<br />1) Adore You - Mature  Miley in full blown RnB ballad. A song Rihanna would do<br />2) We Can't Stop -A teenage anthem. Pure pop fun.<br />3) SMS (Bangerz) ft. Britney Spears - Here we hear Rapping Miley. Using the Niki Minaj influence.<br />4) 4X4 ft Nelly - Rap meets country, a sure head bopper and foot tapper<br />5) My Darling ft Future - Here we have sultry Miley in a nice slow groove, however lyrics are abit mindless.<br />6) Wreaking Ball - Another appearance of mature Miley with a dramatic performance and the cd show piece. Using her voice to great advantage on this song and putting Adele to shame. A stunning performance!!!<br />7)  Love Money Party ft. Big Sean -  Another appearance of Rapping Miley and my least favourite song on the cd.<br />8) # Get it right - Fun Miley again with my favourite lyric \\"Dancing in the mirror, I feel like I got no panties on\\"<br />9) Drive - Another RnB song with more gusto than Adore you but not as memorable.<br />10) F.U. ft. French Montana - Lots of conviction on this song, Alanis Morissette influence. Don't be surprise you find yourself singing along with the chorus<br />11) Do my thang - Rapping Miley is back, but not as hard core as Love Money Party although there are some expletives<br />12) Maybe you're right -  A Katy Perry type song. Miley manages to show the emotion while still having fun.<br />13) Someone else - Another personal moment for Miley<br />Bonus Tracks<br />14) Rooting for my baby -  First of the Pharrell Williams produced songs, great mid-tempo song.<br />15) On my own - Second Pharrell Williams produced song, a funky dance track with a 70's influence.<br />16) Hands in the air ft. Ludacris - Very radio friendly, you will find your hands in the air to this one.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun cd and worth listening to. I am already looking forward to Miley's next album cause I am sure it be full of even more surprises.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Okay all you Whovians, this is probably one of the very few objects that I own that I very much care about. It is wonderful and actually has four different sounds not two. It has both of the pitches for the sonic sound and then two other scanning sound. It is wonderful and it genuinely made me happy. Yes it is just a toy mind you and is all plastic. I dropped it once and now the sound doesn't work but it did last me quite a while before that happened!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a very good read! Was the second time reading, so I must have liked it! A must read for sure!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The story line is incredible. The way the survivors manage to stay alive. How they relate to one another and how they make the incredibly hard choices necessary to keep them safe and together. It's reminds me, in some ways, but not nearly as horrific, of what it will be like during the soon to come tribulation. Prepare for the Rapture and then the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ! Pray for Him to be your Lord and Savior and you will be saved!
1455526959|4.0|In progress. Good detective novel. As with most Connelly work you think you see what's coming and then there are a few more curves. Almost finished. New novel December 2nd.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Okay, I will confess: this is not my fir Columbo collection. I've bought the individual seasons previously but one DVD got stuck in an old player and it went with it because we forgot it was there and a few were skipping or freezing and no matter how many times we cleaned them, the skipping and freezing was coming back after a while. Not to mention that some of the movies I never had. So I HAD to get 'The Complete Series' because Columbo is such a special show: amazingly innovative at the time and still holding strong and very much watchable after all these years.<br /><br />There are many 'old shows' out on DVD these days but Columbo's stand out not only because they were on an unusual 'long' format and most of them followed the unusual Columbo-branded script where the we start by witnessing the crime and then we watch Columbo solving it but also because of the outstanding quality of the DVD rendition. From 'episode one' of 'season one', the picture is crisp and bright, the colors are vibrant and the sound is clear, they almost have a digital quality which makes watching these 30-40+ year old episodes a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />And, yes, not everything is to everybody's liking. This collection has near-zero extras that's not on the DVDs themselves. There are no glossy inserts and even the episodes' names can't be seen unless you look at the interior cover and you will usually have to remove the first or the last disc to access them. No huge deal but, yeah, it's a small inconvenience.<br /><br />Overall, I am simply thrilled to finally have all of Columbo in one box and I highly recommend this to anyone who remembers the old shows or the relatively more recent Columbo mystery movies an ABC and to anyone who would be interested in watching one of the greatest detective TV series ever made. Oh, by the way, the ABC Columbo movies are rendered in a 'wide screen' format so if you watched the movies 'then' on an old TV, you are going to see more of it now.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|Detective Bosch seems too out of place in the short story format. He is legendary by now; better suited for major crimes.
0553288105|5.0|I've been rereading this book periodically since I was a teenager. Now that my daughter is a mother, the way that she chases her toddler around reminds me weirdly of the alien parents in the third book chasing after their wispy third children. Definitely time for another reread.
B00CG5MVD6|5.0|Johnny Depp was silly and great in this movie. All three of the main characters did a great job in this movie. It was bizarre and funny.
B009CG25RO|5.0|This is my favorite Scorsese movie ever. I can't quite say why, but this one resonates with me in a way that RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't. (Thought both were far better received by critics.) Did Sharon Stone at her most luminous, in the best performance she has ever given, have something to with this assessment? Mmmmmaaaybe.

0385523386|4.0|I read this book after having watched the Netflix series that is &#34;based&#34; on the book. I was a fan of the series and wanted to see if the truth matched the show. It did in the good ways - that the women in the prison were kind to each other in such a bad situation, and that Piper was in prison for a charge based on her shuttling money for a drug ring. Then the truth diverges widely from the fiction in that there are no wild Lesbian sexcapades and no crazy Christian wacko hillbilly to beat to a pulp. In fact, the real Piper and Pennsatucky were friends in prison. Piper does make sure that we know she is contemptuous of evangelicals, middle-aged white ladies, all the COs and that she doesn't consider herself better than anyone else. She actually says that - I think in reality, she realized that she liked the women, but I still get the impression that she kinda does think she's a little better, but she's got that earnest white liberal outlook that can't recognize that she might actually not be as prejudice-free as she views herself. In spite of that, I did like the book, and I appreciate the descriptions of the other prisoners and prison life. I also appreciated that while she tries not to judge, she does see that the way people behave affect their lives, and that even in prison, when some women don't act right, they cause trouble for themselves and others.<br /><br />Some reviews claim that Piper never admits that what she did was wrong. She does. And the fact that she is a college-educated, white, blonde, woman with a supportive family and friends and the resources to pay a lawyer DO make a difference in her life, her prison experience and her outlook. I really do feel that some of the reviewers are just hating her because of her fortunate life. I think they wanted a gritty story where people get beat down hourly and voracious bulldaggers are waiting around every corner to rape the unwary. And maybe it messes up their view of prison to be shown Piper's experience, and they don't like it.<br /><br />So in the end, the book is a good read. The show is a good show, but they aren't the same. One is truth, one is fiction. One was written by a real convicted criminal who served real time in a real federal prison, and the other by a long-time Hollywood screenwriter who hasn't been to prison, but knows how to shock and titillate.

B000SFD21Q|5.0|This has been a life changing book for me and ever since listening through the Audible edition, I've put it into practice and have experienced its benefits in all aspects of my life. I only wish I had discovered it sooner.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts and observations:<br /><br />SURPRISING RESEARCH: Even though this book has been out since 2008, I doubt that more than a tiny percentage of the population know of its findings, i.e. that aerobic exercise changes the brain both chemically and structuring, bringing about sustained boosts to your intelligence. I believe that most people have thus mainstream belief about \\"runners high\\" that sustained aerobic exercises puts you in a mood and makes you sharper mentally, but I think the common assumption is that it's a temporary effect that wears off after an hour or two.<br /><br />TRUMPS OTHER PRACTICES: I have practiced meditation and Qigong in the past to improve my mental focus. Along with the research in this book, my subject impression is that aerobic exercise, as taught in this book, is triggers stronger and more sustained improvements in my mental performance.<br /><br />AEROBIC EXERCISE AS A NOOTROPIC DRUG: \\"Aerobic exercise\\" is an almost embarrassingly ancient term from the 1970s and 80s. It conjures images a culture of joggers with headbands who ran listening to their Sony Walkman. It was a fad that, fortunately many people stuck with, but I think primarily because it make them feel good. But these days people get busy in the careers and look to Red Bull and 5-hour Energy to get an mental edge. Some people go hardcore and buy Nootropic supplements to get that \\"investment banker\\" edge. But the author quite astutely maintains that aerobic exercise provides a higher quality enhancement to mental acuity than what people are spending all this money on. For me, that was an earth-shattering revelation.<br /><br />BACKED BY IN-DEPTH STUDIES: The research presented in this book is impeccable. Some studies, such as with schools in Naperville, Illinois involve large numbers of people (in this case, kids) who performed vastly better with their test scores in science and math than the the rest of the population. Other studies presented in the book involve smaller sample sizes and the author was completely forthright in pointing out their lower reliability. While, it is true that the prescribed exercise regimen for enabling your brain to reap these wonderful benefits is just a couple of chapters in this book, I commend the author for not watering the down the science. Think about it. He had to overturn 30 years of the ingrained belief \\"runners high\\" is the only mental benefit stemming from aerobic exercise. For those who have a tough time slogging through the research, try the Audible version.<br /><br />ANSWERS THE QUESTION I'VE ALWAYS HAD. Whenever I've watched top athletes being interviewed on TV, I've noticed -- hey these guys are pretty sharp. I've wondered if they rose to the top ranks of their sport because they're smart or the the practice of their sport made them smarter. This book has allowed me to conclude that it's very likely both.<br /><br />IT MOTIVATES ME: I have exercised regularly since the 1980s, but in recent years I focused on doing interval training twice a week with muscle workouts in between. Since listening to the first few chapters of this book on Audible, I immediately went back to doing 30 minutes of aerobic exercise each morning on a machine I happen to have. No surprise...it definitely helps both my mind and my mental focus. Without having read this book, I would have already known that. But, the big difference now is that I know it can produce measurable improvements in my long-term mental performance, enhance the structure of my brain, and -- as the book contents -- protect myself from Alzheimer's. This is one daily practice that I have every intention to continue.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this is a very important, groundbreaking book probablydeserves far more attention than it's getting. Billions of dollars are being spend on research and drugs for ADHD, Alzheimer's, depression and many other maladies affecting the mind -- that can be helped by this simple aerobic exercise according to the research in this book. Test scores for U.S. students in math and science are now ranked far behind those of other countries. Read (or listen to) this book and I believe you'll find an solution that should be implemented at a national level.<br /><br />It sounds too simplistic and too good to be true doesn't it? But that why reading (or listening to) the scores of studies and research programs is important.deserves far more attention than it's getting.

B000000OF6|5.0|This was to replace my original copies, which I played until they simply wouldn't sing to me anymore.  I really like having them together in one set.
B00F3W9NQ2|4.0|I just finished watching the first four seasons and liked very much. Had to buy the first five of this season because I missed them on tv. This fifth season is a little confussing to me. To many duplicate people and it is hard to follow, for me anyway. I will continue to watch every week because I am a Damon fan.

Just like the original adobe, save documents, high light, comment, sign,etc. It's a free app. I would recommend this app for you if you don't have it. I've used this, and delivers on all my documents needs. :-)***Note***This is not Adobe Flash Player.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I gave it 5 stars, but there is this one moment that Trek fans will take issue with: Someone other than Kirk yelling &#34;KAAAAAHN!!!&#34; Ok, we have another time line, of course.... but it's risky either recycling or camping-up star trek.  Do that again and the fans will eat you, Abrams!  But I still loved it.  All Star Trek movies are my personal love affair.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|As good as the first. Maybe even better. Patricia Cornwell is the greatest storyteller of this generation. Maybe of all the generations to come. A must read for all Scarpetta fans!!!
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|This really was a funny movie, if a bit predictable. There were many &#34;laugh out loud&#34; parts. Definitely worth the rental.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|What can you say.... it's a movie I like and is presented in both Blue-ray and Digital.  Ultraviolet does not have a good interface though.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|I've listened to this album a couple times, and there are some good songs - G.U.Y., Fashion!, Do What U Want and Applause. The rest of it I can take or leave...it just sounds like she's trying too hard.
B00ADR2DTG|5.0|The V2 on it's own is outstanding, the sound is very colorful, smooth & rich. The better the cans, the better the sound as you would expect. I use a older set of Bose headphones for now. I will prolly upgrade to something better in time. They have served me well for years now their time is coming to an end,  BUT..if you want it a more full stage as I wanted. I linked it up as a pre-amp to a Fiio A1 Amp, in turn powers Micca Club 3's which are my main monitor speakers for my computer sound system, I also have a set of old Sony 3&#34; satellite monitors I re-fitted with RS75-4 3&#34; Reference Full-Range Driver's from Dayton & a 10&#34; Kicker Comp Sub pushed by a Lepai LP-168HA for it's sub output. The Fiio A1 amp sounds rather nice on it's own, but paired with this as a preamp music really shines...giving me the beautiful near field sound stage I was aiming for. I tried many different configurations but in the end, the set up I have now gives me what I was after. A headphones sound without the need for headphones.<br /><br />I honestly don't think it would sound as rich & pure without this as the preamp. I didn't feel the stock tube it comes with was giving me the sound I thought it should be, so I swapped it out for a JJ Electronics 12AU7 / ECC82 Preamp Tube. In doing so, after the tube burn in time, it has really come alive the way I was hoping it would. Classical guitar almost brings a tear to your eye as if it were being played in front of you. Simply amazing. Bass isn't overly punchy, just deep & solid. Mids are richly enhanced & the highs accurately sparkle.<br /><br />It's size/thickness is comparable to two iPod classics stacked on top of each other with the tube popping out of the top. RCA input is on the right side (Use the RCA input, it's sounds better as apposed to the----&#62; ) & AUX 3.5mm input is in the front, center front is the volume dial (not an ON/OFF dial), to the left of that is the 1/4&#34; headphone jack. The ON/Off Power switch & 12V 3.5A DC power plug-in are in the back. (I'm thinking on upping the juice output a bit by using a 12V 4.5A power supply although the supplied power brick seems to do just fine for now). Overall it's pretty straight forward. The &#34;bells & whistles&#34; are it's AMAZING sound quality & visual appeal, it's got serious &#34;cool factor&#34; going on with it's soft &#34;Blue Purplish&#34; glow that separates into blue & red... It's not too obnoxiously bright. A Blue LED under the Tube (that makes the tube glow blue) & a red LED behind that. The heat sinks stay pretty warm to the touch but it hasn't clipped due to an overheating issue. Although I haven't had a need to turn it ALL the way up either. 1/3rd to 1/2 way seems to be just fine paired with the Fiio A1 amp also turned up to 1/2 way for my listening needs.<br /><br />I almost got the step up version of this (BRAVO Audio V3 Tube Headphone Amplifier) which also has a physical EQ added to it. But I went for this one for it's size & simplistic nature. Music should sound good as it is. Besides how often these days do you come across a media source that doesn't have EQ settings of some sort?!C power plug-in are in the back.

I did want the black pair for my last order but My size was not available, oh well maybe next time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have loved the entire series.  I have suggested it to friends who have also enjoyed the whole theme.  I would suggest it to any SciFi reader
B0089XH38M|5.0|On line comments and my previous experience with AVG software prompted me to select this product. my wife recently had problems with her phone and I installed it on hers.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Horrible. The format is confusing and frustrating. The email ordering and layouts do not make sense. If at all possible use any other email service, including fingernail scratches on a metal plate.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|In combination with 7Notes, I use evernote extensively to replace my Franklin Planner for meeting notes and followups.  It has become my go to tool for notes and reminders of almost any form, given the ability to get to the information from any device - kindle, iphone, desktop, etc. etc.  Always able to find what I'm looking for, and to quickly backup and sync any notes on any given device.  A no brainer to add to your toolbelt.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great and addictive game<br />Also a must play for all ages.<br />If you enjoy tablet games then for.sure.buy this
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Have always been an Eminem fan and was concerned that this album might not live up to the high standard he has set....that concern was GONE from the first track!  Rap God might be the best ever.  This entire album just reminds me that he is one of the greatest lyricists to ever live.  Everyone should get this!
B003YFIUW8|2.0|Lots of other books out that that capture and keep my interest.<br />Takes too long to tell the  story. Very predictable. Underwritten.  The story could have been much more developed in my opinion.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The only bad thing you could say about Fringe it's no longer in production.  I think I'm watching the complete series for the 7th or 8th time online.  It is out there in some ways, parallel universes, etc. but not so far out that it is ridiculous.  It has some enough comic relief, Walter, to keep plots from being to dark.  In all it was well written and well acted.  I miss seing Anna Torv on TV here in the US.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed the whole series of Downton Abby and anticipate future seasons.  In fact. I purchased Amazon Prime for that very reason
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Because this author knows how to tell a good story which is what I'm always looking forward to in a good book.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|My Granddaughter wanted this for Christmas and the doll is very pretty.  I know she will enjoy this Barbie Holiday Doll.
B00G91WB3S|5.0|This the absolute best &#34;Superman&#34; movie ever made....several things were brought out in the movie that I had never heard of before...the effects were phenomenal. I suggest you watch it on at least a 32&#34; or bigger screen with good stereo speakers. This movie will not disappoint!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't remember this game making me feel as stupid when I played it on Facebook. I also don't remember having to pay for every single boost or having to wait 20 minutes to play a board after I'd failed it several times. However, it is challenging and can be as much fun as it is frustrating! Good game for people who want to have to work for their wins!
B00FY2UJAU|5.0|Fast & Furious 6 has got to be the best action packed movie of the year, in my opinion. I love the way they they tied all of the movies together.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the better novels of this series. The author seems to think killing all the heroes makes for a good plot. Can't say I agree.
B008476HBM|4.0|With a strong will and an independent mind, Elizabeth Bennett overcomes a lack of fortune and family embarrassments to find true love with very honorable but misunderstood Mr. Darcy.  Despite its age, the story still fees current.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read as John Grisham always is!  I loved seeing<br /> Jake Brigance in action again.  Interesting to have it refer back to A Time to Kill.
0823015033|5.0|While I haven't read the entire book yet, I can tell that the amount of information and the quality of the material is such that I would highly recommend this book! The cost of this book is less than the cost of one private art lesson. The amount of information that you are getting is easily equal to an entire course!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I hope I do not have to wait forever for the next season. This show is just so good. Watch it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The Good:<br />1. Easy to setup and use - when everything works exactly as intended.<br />2. The direct play mode for Youtube has excellent picture quality.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1. Totally unusable performance when streaming from your PC's video player (the primary reason I purchased it) - picture freezes, stutters, out of sync, etc.<br />2. No support or documentation - clearly #1 is a common issue - found many people complaining about it - but Google provides just about zero support. This appears to be the case for all issues with this device - if you have to go under the hood for any reason, Google provides no useful support.<br /><br />In Sum:<br />I would not recommend this device - it fails to perform as promised.  There are less simple - but much more reliable - methods for streaming or directly playing video from your PC to your TV screen.  However, if you only want to stream from some service that is not on Roku and is one of the services that Google has setup for direct download with Chromcast (like Youtube), then this might be a solution for you.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|Does not rotate  at all on my Kindle Fire. So, it is not helpful when I use my bluetooth keyboard case.
159514188X|1.0|This book was terrible. I made myself finish it in hopes there would be something to justify her actions. The things she pinned on others were either so small and minuscule OR something that happened that she HERSELF was completely in control of. I don't know how this book has become a best seller. Like every teen doesn't have complicated relationships with others. Nothing happened to this girl that would warrant suicide. End of story. It makes me sad for all of those that chose this route that actually did go through something terrible and detrimental. This book cheapens their experiences. I not once found myself liking this Hannah character.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This is a phenominal calculator!  No buttons to push, just write with your finger or stylus.  It recognizes almost every finger stroke and can be edited on the fly.  It can do routine calculations as well as solve equations etc etc.  This app is a pure delight!  And it automatically rotates from portrait to landscape and back again.  Unbelievable that something this good is free !
B004UXUUDA|4.0|Good moving original story, good performances. Kristin Scott Thomas doesn't disappoint. Wish we could see more of her! Her best role yet was &#34;The English Patient,&#34; in my view.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an outstanding mini-series that is worth viewing over and over. Giamatti gives a great performance throughout, as do the other actors. No other series has made me feel such a part of history. A very worthwhile purchase.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I remember when I first played the game that this one was fashioned after. I enjoyed then, and I enjoy now.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've used the headset about a month and it is pretty good. My previous headset was a run down logitech headset that finally started having issues with its charge port. The charge port on this headset seems much more firm and I doubt I will run into any issues regarding that. I enjoy the full ear covers and how the covers can pivot a bit, so that if I move the headset around on my head (to slide forward to hear someone speak to me in the same room) it will adjust in a natural way so as not to stress the headset. I ranked it 4/5 simply because I feel I have not worn enough headsets of different brands/makes to give the product a perfect score.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app.  Easy to install, easy to understand and easy to use. I would highly recommend this app to speed up and clean up your device.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Drama thriller: great story, characters, and great acting that's all you need in the season! Downloading from amazon was great n it's in HD for free if your a prime member
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I am totally hooked on this game!  Each board is a little different so you never know what to expect.  It keeps me totally entertained and occupied for hours at a time.
0385537131|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best books. It kept my attention all the way through! It compares favorably to The Client List and The Firm.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great scenery, photography, excellent plot and wonderful acting by all actors.  A real page turner.  Would love to have the series on a DVD.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|I told myself I'd watch one episode of this show, since it was available on Prime and I needed something to enjoy as a brief study break, and I ended up watching it all the way through until two in the morning. I have previously enjoyed the Gwyneth Paltrow version of &#34;Emma,&#34; and while that film had great chemistry between Paltrow and Jeremy Northam, this version really captured the varied relationships that underpin the story.<br /><br />The casting was delightful. Romola Garai, who I have loved on &#34;The Hour,&#34; is an inspired choice for Emma. I agree with another reviewer that she is perhaps a bit more modernly skewed than other versions of Emma, but the actress' face was so expressive that you could really see every surprise, delight, and frustration that Emma is experiencing. I saw that another reviewer criticized Jonny Lee Miller's age as Knightley, but I was so impressed by his chemistry with Garai that it was hard to be distracted by that fact. Indeed, while I enjoyed the Paltrow/Northam dynamic in the earlier film, the BBC miniseries makes it clear that Emma and Knightley are truly attracted to each other. The supporting cast was equally lovely, and the cinematography was tremendously well-done.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it is a small one, is the tonal shift that occurred in the third episode. The director suddenly began favoring voice-overs, for example. I do not usually notice these things, so the fact that it actually stood out to me suggests a slight inconsistency in the storytelling. Indeed, there were a few points where shots seemed almost exactly like those employed in &#34;Clueless&#34; (the movie starring Alicia Silverstone that updates &#34;Emma&#34; to upscale California in the 90s).<br /><br />The complaints are few. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and may buy a copy for my shelf, just in case, for I know that I'll want to watch it again. I am a big fan of BBC miniseries--&#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; and &#34;North & South&#34; are well-loved DVDs on my shelf--but I especially enjoyed the tone of &#34;Emma,&#34; which was a bit lighter and more &#34;fun&#34; than those heavier subjects.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|Funny Movie that is irreverent with all the Seth McFarlane magic with a unforeseen  sensitive side. Good Chemistry between Mark and Mila, and nothing beats the appearance of a very special superhero.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Basic, but good. I gifted this to several friends and we did the exercises together and reported on a private FB group. Some of us felt it was too basic, but most of us liked the idea that we not take what we think we know or have done before for granted...Good for new and old practitioners.
B000002GI0|5.0|just plain good listening ,story telling ,humor and good music and john hiatt unique voice brings it all together like all his albums
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I absolutely love this game! A bit confusing at first because I thought it was like hexic,  but quickly figured out the technique and now I cannot put it down! A great game for challenging the mind. Glad I downloaded it :)
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is really fun, but not great on time. If you want a game to play off of the internet this is great. Also if you like building and unlocking games such as Farmville, and/or castle Ville this game is great for you.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|saw peter frampton about  a year before this disc was recorded and the man still rocks!!! also the program was recorded at the Pabst theatre in milwaukee. the sound there is excellent. the Pabst goes to show you they don&#34;t build them like  they used to.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|i really enjoy this game i can forget about the real world.  i can use my imagination and have fun. i would recommend this game for all.
B00GMONG90|5.0|I have loved Pentatonix ever since the Sing-off and their work since then has been nothing short of amazing. This album is their best work yet and I have listened to it every day since purchasing it. My wife and children also love it. If you have seen any of their videos I don't know how you haven't bought this already,<br /><br />Oh, and Avi fans, he has some delicious moments here.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My kids and grand kids recommended it to me and I love as much as they do. It's a great<br />way to clear a stressful time from your mind.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An incredibly written book of beauty, love, strength.  Of ugly, hate, and weakness.  But mostly of beauty. This book will stay with me forever
1936608898|5.0|It explained diabetes to me so well that I now really understand what has happened in my body. My copy is all high lighted and underlined and I refer back to it frequently.
B008XK69S6|1.0|I found you while searching for wma player. You aren't. Found all our files. Loaded album art. Won't play my files.
B007HO392S|5.0|Almost every song on this is great.<br /><br />Every song on this album is great. Everyone must have found this so because so many single hits came out of it.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is another delightfully awesome book from Brandon Sanderson.  If you have liked anything he has written, you will like this too.  He hasn't put out a bad book yet.
B006MVJ2L4|3.0|To me, the singing sounded too much like shouting; it was too loud for my taste.  I did not really care for it.  I loved his previous album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Kept me on my toes..does give you that suspense feel as you read each chatercan't wait to read the third book.
0762777931|5.0|Easy to read and understand. Great energy, very motivating. I would recommend this to anyone interesting in taking control of their health!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|when ever I try to download this it kept saying unable to download it stinks like poop<br />so never download like what every other person says
0812983459|4.0|This was a fun read though I may have enjoyed the map as much as I enjoyed the journey this time!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this app. I'm learning to play all over again and I love it. It's so fun and easy to play and so easy to find the music.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|This is probably the worst album Depeche Mode has ever made. Dont waste your money. Total garbage. I have been a fan for a long time and I dont know why they released this album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing!! Love this series cannot wait  to read the third book!! Oh Christian & Anastasia Grey. :) so heartfelt. Love!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lovely cheerful graphics and real addictive fun. Really enjoy playing this game. Although I think a little more variety could be added to the different levels.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire HD and I love it. It's just a basic calculator. I use it to figure out calories/fat/carbs/protien in foods I make in large quantities for my diet. It makes it alot faster. If you need a basic calculator I recommend this one.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was action packed, well paced with a lot of twists and turns in the writing. It also impressive that this movie has a woman starring in this type of film. Angelina Jolie gives a great performance in this movie and even manages to do most of her own stunts in this movie. Wow.<br />I also enjoyed watching some of the special features on the Blu-ray edition. It was pretty interesting finding out some of the details on how this movie was made. Check out some of the disguises that were used for Angelina Jolie in this movie. In one of the disguises, I never would have guessed that it was actually her.<br />I highly recommend this movie on Blu-ray. Enjoy!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I need the second one soon!! It's so great and it'll have you on the edge of your seat! Action! Love!
B005EWDA9M|4.0|1Q84 is, like much of Murakami's other writing a book of great imagination and prose that is poetic in its imagery.  The story is tense and the eventual meeting of the two main protagonists that is resisted by the law and the cult of the murdered man is riveting.  The book also poses the moral question of wether it is ethical to kill in order to punish evil doers.  A long and complex book, as good as his best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is a really fun and cool game and it is not only realistic bit life like too.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|If you were looking to buy this book AFTER watching the movie &#34;World War Z&#34;, expecting what you saw to be in these pages - stop right now.<br /><br />A few &#34;facts&#34;: This book was written BEFORE the movie was even on the Hollywood bidding table; The movie contains less than a &#34;grain of sand&#34; in terms of the content of this book (especially after the re-written ending).<br /><br />This is a book to be enjoyed for what it is: a brilliant piece of &#34;scarily real&#34; fictional memoirs or records of the years the entire planet fought to rid itself of the &#34;plague of the undead&#34;. Deliberately setting out to be the &#34;anonymous UN Correspondent&#34; who travels to key points on the globe to interview, talk, & see first hand the outcomes of the ways in which each country dealt with &#34;Zack&#34;. From the &#34;state of the art&#34; war machines that were proved useless, to the amazing recollections of survivors, to the return to hand tools, sniffer dogs & basic survival skills. Each country, each interviewee & their stories were unique & three-dimensional.<br /><br />As I wrote in the review header, this is a book for the true &#34;purist&#34;: the zombie enthusiast, apocalyptic theorist, & (most importantly) the bibliophile.  If you want gore, action & &#34;in the actual moment&#34; events, this isn't the book for you. But if you want a moving series of stories of overcoming impossible odds, beautifully written, & thought provoking, I can't think of a better book (in the fiction/post-apocalyptic genre).
B007N8RULO|5.0|this is a fun game, it keeps you thinking and watching your time, you want to see how good you can improve your time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Enjoying it so far. It reminds me of the older Stephen King works: Carrie, The Dark Half, and (of course) The Shining.<br /><br />It kicks of nice and quickly, with the woman from Room 217 giving Danny a nice visit, so don't be prepared to sit on your laurels while the scenery is built.<br /><br />Oh, and re-read The Shining. You'll be glad you did.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game because you get to play with the game but they should let people know another person and meet them so you have someone to play with.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is so much fun, and they have so many sales! i really hope that they get another upgrase but other than that, amazing!!!
0792839730|5.0|the Lesson here is don't bite off more than you can chew. and don't under rate your opponent be on your guard at all times. This Movie had a great cast of characters. They were very will picked for the parts they played. It is worth you time to watch it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is so much fun. I could absolutely play for hours and hours. I just got the game yesterday and I have barely put it down since.
1616550414|5.0|Meets expectations and is a nice large size. Lots of Information on Skyward Sword and Nintendo finally reveals it's Canon Timeline.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Always one of the best of all time movies. It has some age on it but still is one movie to put on your list to see.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|A little slow at first but the more you get in to it the better<br />It's best to have a lot of things going on
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes.  Well-acted and well-produced.  Looking forward to watching the rest.  I like it just as much as the new Sherlock Holmes series on American TV.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I adored the Secret History<br />Read it three or four times.But this felt like dredging a dead body through the pouring rain.I stopped at page 440 something<br />..however,I will get the little friend.Anything that controversial has to have something for me<br /><br />...love
B00BAXFECK|2.0|This book was a disappointment.  I love &#34;My Little Friend&#34; and was anxiously awaiting the next book.  There were no characters to even care about -- I'm amazed that the reviews were as good as they were.  My advice - pick another book.
B00F5HWC7W|5.0|Awesome a lil bit of songs from each of their phenomenal albums personally I really enjoyed Mr Brightside the original version track featured on this album. also the when you were young Calvin Harris version was a nice twist one of my favorite songs! 5 stars very Happy with this album like i am with all the rest of my 5 killers albums!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|By the end of the series, it sort of became about the evils of science. It was bad, and not something we should be teaching our teenagers (not to mention the rather horrible final moments in the book).
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Despite what other reviews say this is not a copy. If they knew anything they would know that 505 Games is the developer of terraria for console and mobile. Re-logic made the game for pc.
B00008G8M4|5.0|Action, Drama along with a bit of humor proves Independence Day a &#34;want&#34; to view time after time! Go get it!
B00C1040TO|1.0|It does not work on a Kindle, so I am going to delete it.  Disappointed as it seemed like a great idea.
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is quite the Masterpiece. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the rest of the cast were at their best!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Now I may not have agreed with the end bun none the less it was still the best book I have read this year. I really hope you get this book along with all the others that go along with it because I think it teaches a wonderful lesson that is sometimes forgotten and these stories spark that idea once more. Please read this book and enjoy!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Lawless brings back grand theft memories proving the levels of corrupt government interference! A must see and A must have DVD!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Once again......no disappointment with Lee Child. The need to turn page after page kept the book in my hands for hours at a time.
6304711891|5.0|An all out well-planned rescue vs an all out well-planned remorse promotes an action movie explosion! Sit back and enjoy this ride!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|amazing adicting game you must have new updates every month it is just an amazing<br />one of the best games.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Bruce Willis at his best again, even when conquering the end of time as we know it! Good job to the crew of Armageddon!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Harlen coben is an amazing author. Every book I read gets better and better. I highly recommend reading all his books!
B00BOTCJXC|3.0|I didn't enjoy this as much The Forsyte Saga, but it is very entertaining due to the two main actors, especially Cumberbatch.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love the original castleville this version is only vaguely similar its fun but not near the original. You do the same things over and over again.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this! It was so positive and upbeat and actually really inspiring. As the title says, its nine experiments that take 48 hours- 78 hours to manifest. All experiments have anecdotal evidence told in humorous fashion. And it really does work! I thoroughly recommend this!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A quick, powerful read about Frankl's suffering in the camps, the evolution of logotherapy, and applied lessons of his branch of psychology. Though a quick read, this is a message that will stick a lifetime and should probably be reread to reinforce the message. In addition, the writing is a joy to read. Well done.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Best.Eminmem.  He's baaaccckkk! I love how he went back to what works! He is great  at the type of rap he was known for..just drifted the last few albums but I like his style from the early 2000s.  Much anticipated and awesome
1490313370|5.0|Awesome book, I really enjoyed it. Before reading the book I was having trouble with coming up with business ideas.....now I work on writing down 15 ideas a day, and it does help. I am normally NOT a &#34;self help&#34; reader, but this book has an interesting take on viewing your actions in the past & future in a different way.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />The few things I learned from Fangirl:<br /><br />* Fan fiction is a real living breathing thing for some people<br />* Not every NA book is just a poorly plotted YA book set in college using sex to fill the holes.<br />* I was not as lost in college as some people were.<br />* Everyone should have an emergency dance party play list ready and waiting<br />* Alpaca wool is hypoallergenic<br /><br />When done right an NA novel can be fantastic. It can be a story about the discovery of the person someone has the potential to become. It is a departure from caring what your peers thought of you in high school and finding out what you think of yourself. It is the beginning of the direction you will be taking in your life. The amount a person changes between 18 and 22 is exponential. Fangirl explored this in a way that captured my imagination, attention and made me remember all of the changes I went through in those years of discovery.<br /><br />Things I liked about Fangirl:<br /><br />The characters<br /><br />Cath a socially awkward twin who has just been dumped by her best friend/twin sister has to branch out on her own for the first time ever. She has never met new people on her own, she has always had her twin to blaze the way and now she is living with a new roommate, at a new school with no clue how to even find the dining hall.<br /><br />Reagan Is Cath's roommate and can be a little mean, okay a lot mean. But to Cath it really seems like Reagan has her act together. Reagan has been at college for a few years now and she finds her new freshman roomie well let's face it she finds her pretty hopeless.<br /><br />\\"I feel sorry for you, and I'm going to be your friend.\\"<br />\\"I don't want to be your friend,\\" Cath said as sternly as she could. \\"I like that we're not friends.\\"<br />\\"Me, too. I'm sorry you ruined it by being so pathetic.\\"<br /><br />I liked Reagan she sort of becomes the big sister Cath has never had and takes her under her wing. Sure she is a little mean but in a fun snarky way that makes her likable. Cath is so unsure of herself and can let people walk all over her. Reagan shows her that it is okay to stand up for yourself, to say \\"no\\" and stick to it.<br /><br />Levi ah he is practically perfect in every way. Almost too perfect to be any shade of real. As my friend Ash would say it is probably because he is made of Rainbows and Brownies. But I don't care because I absolutely love him. I love that he is everything that Cath is not. He is easy with people, confident, secure and so sweet he could give you a toothache (shout out to Clueless).<br /><br />\\"You look so blindingly cute right now, I feel like I need to make a pinhole in a piece of paper just to look at you.\\"<br /><br />He is everything the first boy you fall in love with should be if you knew what you were doing the first time you fell in love.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />I loved that this is a story of discovery of stepping out of the comfort zone you lived in your whole life and discovering that you are more than you thought you could be. Sure there are mistakes and setbacks along the way. Maybe you get so focused on some of the things that are not really as important and you lose your way, but people help and you help yourself and eventually a balance is found. In the immortal words of Miss Frizzle Take Chances, make mistakes, get messy.<br /><br />The Romance<br /><br />Can I just applaud Ms Rowell for not taking the easy road and using sex to move the story along. Just because you are in college and you met 5 pages ago doesn't mean you need to be in bed together two chapters later. Even though this relationship moves slower than most I loved that while Cath was so closed in on herself when she met a good guy he took the time to get to know her and bring her out of her shell a little. Once she felt comfortable with him she let walls down and I grinned stupidly and happily at the dialog between them.<br /><br />\\"What if I promise not to touch you?\\"<br />\\"Cath laughed. \\"Now I have zero incentive to come.\\"<br />\\"What if I promise to let you touch me first?\\"<br />\\"Are you kidding? I'm the untrustworthy person in this relationship. I'm all hands.\\"<br />\\"I've seen no evidence of that, Cath.\\"<br />\\"In my head, I'm all hands.\\"<br />\\"I want to live in your head.\\"<br /><br />The first time you fall in love takes time and talking and I loved their journey.<br /><br />Things I didn't like about Fangirl:<br /><br />There were only a few things. One of them was the actual Fan Fiction. I wasn't a fan of the Harry Potteresk fan fiction scattered throughout. I read it and I get why it was there but it sometimes detracted from the other parts of the story for me. But you can probably skip it and not miss anything of vital importance other than you know that Cath writes it religiously and has a large on line following.<br /><br />The other thing I didn't like was the ending - Because it ended and I wanted more. It seemed to end abruptly I read this on a kindle and listened on audiobook and in the kindle the transition from the Simon story to the other story wasn't clear in the formatting so I was confused for a few minutes. It was better when listening to the audiobook since I thought maybe I was missing a few pages.<br /><br />I wanted to live with the characters even longer. That isn't a necessarily a bad thing I just wanted to know more about the future of the characters.<br /><br />This was a great read and I really liked the entire story of Cath. If you are looking for a well thought out NA book that makes you think and feel with your heart and not just your hormones then this is has everything you need. Rainbow Rowell's characters jump off the page and make you want to hang out with them get to know them and take a piece of them everywhere you go.ise not to touch you?\\"<br />\\"Cath laughed. \\"Now I have zero incentive to come.\\"<br />\\"What if I promise to let you touch me first?\\"<br />\\"Are you kidding?

B007QPFGJW|5.0|I love the character of Harry Hole. Nesbo is a riveting writer.  His stories are complex and full of surprises.
B005721W9O|5.0|This is an old family favorite of ours.  We have two boys.  When they were still living at home we would watch it once a year as a family fun night tradition.  Except for one profanity moment it is clean, family friendly, funny, and even has a good message.
B00C32R64G|3.0|I think their older albums are better, more hard hitting, heavier than this one. I still love Volbeat, but wish they came out with some more stuff like Rebel Monster, Danny and Lucy, Moment Forever, etc.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I love all things Star Trek. There is no such thing as a bad star Trek movie in my opinion.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game, it does have some cliches on my kindle fire. The game is a realistic approach to hunting, with a variety of guns to purchase as you move throughout the game, a little pricey but a must. The download time for new regions as you advance takes quite awhile to upload this could be fixed.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a great read. It started off a little boring but once it gets your attention it keeps it to the end.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I like the action right out of the start it opens up in the adventure I thought it was well made
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|still waiting for connection on android phone, tablet to chromecast in browser other thancommercial sites ---- it is what I purchased it for
B00BATG18K|4.0|The Valley of Amazement kept my attention and was enjoyable.  However I did not enjoy it as much as her other books.  I would still recommend it as a good book for a rainy day read.<br />.
B005K17RU0|5.0|but still love the app.  Has all the information I'm looking for and lets me save many locations--useful since I travel a lot.
B003ZHVJFK|5.0|I bought this for my son, and he says it is great.  He collects the animae stuff, so this was truly a treat.
0802473156|5.0|Excellent book for learning how to love people the way they want to be loved.  I was able to put some of these ideas into practice and the results were great.
B002NZK5RI|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I love scary, but not chop them up movies.  The cast is fabulous and the story line was very interesting, with twists and turns throughout the movie.  Very well done, and still somewhat scary.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Love love love this movie.  It's cute, the whole family likes to watch it.  It's  just a &#34;feel good movie&#34;
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We bought this for our son, before we took him to see the play live in Chicago, kind of as a see what is coming birthday gift, and he still plays this often, sometimes too often.  What beautiful voices.
B000SW16LC|5.0|My girls and I  love this movie.  This movie gets us all into the Christmas spirit.  And I have no more words.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I bought this for my husband, and he loves it, bit I think he likes looking at the cover almost as much as listening to the music.

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Loved the Kindle Edition. Very handy to read when bored and away from home. Seems to be the same as the original paperback, but way handier. The movie was good, but the book is better. I'd say see the movie and then read the book. Way more detail and a classic.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Amazon customer service was amazing! I told them my original cable had become very brittle and was completely falling apart. Not only did they give me a credit towards the new cable but after I received the conformation of purchase they refunded the shipping! So glad I have a kindle with customer service like this. Thank you, Thank you!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I am a hunter of white deer and I love the challenge this gives you. And you don't freeze outside!!!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Amazing acting and story.  Loved the small reminder of Fallen which Denzel and John Goodman were both in.  Loved the ending.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I like shooting, well, target practice and this is less expensive than bullets! I love to angle my shoots on here, which you can't do with real bullets!
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|Perfect for rooted Android device (specifically Galaxy SII phone). I think this is professionally written and well thought out. Happy to get it on faotd!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed the hidden object searches. The objects were not too easy to find . The puzzles were just hard enough to keep my interest.
B000O59AFW|5.0|Great action film! Now I have the entire series of MI films. A must have series if you like action movies
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Original Start Trek is always my favorite, and the remastered version was extremely well-done--outside scenes (mostly space/planet views) were redone using modern computer generated images, and mesh seamlessly with the original show.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read and re read this trilogy. I enjoyed it in the way that I could not put it down. Very interesting.
B005N4F48Q|5.0|I loved this movie. I was in Gettysburg Nov. 16th and 23rd for some of the events for the 150th anniversary of the dedication of Soldiers National Cemetery which occurred on November 19, 1863 where Lincoln spoke our National Prayer (the Gettysburg Address) for the freedom Of the People, By the People, and For the People, that these honored American soldiers fought to preserve, both North and South. This movie was a pleasure to watch because it was filmed at Gettysburg and some of the battles were filmed a few miles South of the actual/protected grounds. The battles, the geographic names, the people, the events, the actions, the flags and symbols, ... everything in the movie was actual fact. Of course there was even more that happened.  Please visit these sites to learn more, and if you have the chance, travel to historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. You will be surprized to find that it has been preserved to 1863. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the battle of Little Round Top and the 20th Maine, and Picketts Charge, and then to visit the actual sites and monuments and walk quietly and respectfully on those hallowed grounds. I especially loved Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee, and how painstakingly Martin memorized the actual words of the General and his demeanor and gestures and showed him very accurately and authentically (rather than putting his own narrative on it, as many actors do). [...] [...] [...]  [...]  [...]  Here is an interesting fact: did you know that Joshua Chamberlain (20th Maine) went on to become a Major General and Grant selected him to receive Lee's surrender at Appomattox.
1478951508|5.0|J.K. Rowling is truly a master of capturing the nature of what it means to be human on the page.  Every nuance of emotion is all there.  Her characters are complex and they came fully to life for me when reading this book.  Yes people, it is no wonder the book is 500 pages!  She weaves this tale deftly, though there is a large cast of characters and not one thread is broken.  She is also a genius when it comes to WHAT to reveal and conceal and WHEN to reveal and conceal.  This truly makes her an expert storyteller.<br /><br />This is not a feel good kind of book.  It is a cautionary tale.  The issues are very real and so are the consequences.<br /><br />The most significant take away for me was that in every society people get so caught up in the everyday self-absorbed, self-fabricated drama of life that they forget what really matters.  People find themselves drifting into an US vs. THEM mentality in their communities and even in their own households and families.  People think that all they have to do is keep a safe distance from poverty and the have-nots and they will be safe from any of the ills of society falling upon them or their loved ones.  What matters most in this book is the children and the legacy being left by the parents in this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|handy, nice to be connected to my library no matter where i am without having to drag around another piece of gear!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a 'drive you crazy' game.....but when you conquer a level and<br />move on, you want to let the world know.
0316322407|5.0|My 9 year old reads it to me and thinks it is interesting. Malala seems almost too well informed.  It helps us to appreciate our American freedom.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Doctor Who has become my favorite program on television. I started with the Christopher Eccleston year and eventually went back to the beginning and watched the first episodes. Love it. I am going to have to hide under my covers for 2 days trying to avoid &#34;spoilers&#34; because I'm going to wait to see the 50th Anniversary special on the big screen!
B0063GORYU|4.0|have not had chance to use it much yet!  nice to offer this game for free, thank you very much
B00F880BWG|5.0|If you are currently a walking dead diehard then there is no explanation necessary as you already know that this is the best series on television!  (spoiler alert) The governor is back and the ending will make you want more in anticipation of the next episode!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It doesnt look like much from the cover image.  But what a great show; music, charachter development, acting, plot..  We try not to watch too many episodes too quickly savoring each show.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Any Pink Floyd fan should own this.  For a DVD the sound quality is superb and the video quality is decent. I had always appreciated David Gilmore as a guitarist, but after watching him &#34;work&#34; on a couple of tracks on this DVD I went from appreciative to awestruck. He is one of the best and if you're not convinced already, just give this a watch.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Well written, thought provoking book based in an era of civil rights transition when the children of the 50's and 60's were adjusting to the rights and abilities of minorities as compared to the beliefs of their parents.  Perfect sequel to &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|War, sex, death, an evil, manipulating mother-in-law, adultery, sibling rivalry, politics, racism, and betrayal.<br /><br />And for good measure, fear-induced diarrhea.<br /><br />Yep, just another “African novel,” right?<br /><br />Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche has written a masterpiece.  She has chosen war-torn Nigeria in the 1960’s, and she has selected (mostly) African characters as her vehicles in which she tells a heart-wrenching story.  Yet, her startling tale, at its core, is not necessarily about the 1960’s, or High Life music, or even Africa.<br /><br />It’s about you and me.<br /><br />Half of a Yellow Sun is captivating.  I loved it while hating it.<br /><br />I was reminded of a few of my own best characteristics-as well as some of the very things I despise the most about myself.<br /><br />I was reminded that I have the potential of achieving dizzying heights, and I am capable of wounding, and even destroying, the ones I love the most by unspeakable lows.<br /><br />Half of a Yellow Sun represents the very best kind of historical fiction, as Adichie paints her characters with deep, unflinching emotions.  Some of them are heroic and brave, and others are mean, despicable, and cowards.  More accurately stated,  most of the main characters in the novel actually contain both greatness that inspires, and evil that disappoints.<br /><br />This seems to be exactly what makes them so realistic, so believable, so frustrating-and so much like me.
0024181900|4.0|Informative, concise, and an excellent reminder of middle school grammer basics. I would recommend this to any management level person. I also have, and endorse, the fourth and updated edition which gives a good glossery of terms and editing tips which we all may have forgotten.
B000E5N6LG|4.0|excellent movie, seems like run time very long
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There are issues with this app.  It tends to lose connection even when my kindle has connection.  Receiving tickets to advance tends to not come as quickly as the tickets are sent by your friends.  You are not able to utilize any extra moves that might be sent to you, and I'm yet to see any bonus power ups available to me on the kindle version that were sent to me for levels I've become stuck on.  Logging out of facebook or connecting to facebook almost seems as if the selection process takes more stylus touches than actually entering my user name and pw, are you sure you want to sign out, you sure, really sure, really really sure.......... sign out already!<br /><br />All that said, I'm very glad there is a version of this for the Kindle now.  sure, it needs work, but considering CCS players that use Kindles had nothing before, I'm happy to say for once, I am not going to remove stars for the negative remarks I've made.  They are minor as I'm sure, this is a work in progress and the developer might have been rushed into releasing something before the next Kindle generation comes out.
B000L9EKL0|4.0|Honestly, this is my favorite movie of all times. Owen Wilson delivers an awesome performance that will make you proud to be American...
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best 007 since Sean Connory. He has one hot bod and nice dark deep voice. lovely.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|excellently written - keeps the readers attention throughout the book - if you haven't read Grisham before then this is a must read
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Its still not as good as simply logging on to Facebook if you have the ability but it still functions great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Look out cable television, Google is on your heels. This device is great and works flawlessly. I love watching YouTube on the big screen. I don't have Hulu or download Google movies but I  have Netflix which I can activate from my smartphone. Not bad for a $35.00 one time charge.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Can't really complain there are some minor tweaks that might make the experience smoother but all in all it works as advertised
B00EBJ624O|5.0|I like her piano play. that is a nice play and good audio .I used to listen at You tube, I like it so I buy them
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Received in perfect condition and quickly once the movie was released.  Since I didn't have the cash to buy this, using my amazon card was a perfect way to do it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love all of this game. It is a really fun game it is so fun. You need to get this.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's fun if u want to travel the world or in love with animals when ur older this is the game for u
B00F91SCXC|5.0|wow loved it wish it was more like the walking dead hope it continues with a tv series or something
B00E34A9FU|4.0|As others have posted, this is a very good concert. However, there is much better out there for all songs. Unless you are a completest, there is nothing unique here that surpasses anything else in your collection. Personally, I think this concerts reputation is a bit inflated. Also, there was no need to include all the commentary about the heat and drought. Maybe for those who were there. This is in regard to the CD's...I have yet to view the DVD.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I was sorry to see the book come to an end.John is back to his fantastic WRITINGS.Welcome back John.I am ready for more entertainment  . Bring on the mysteries John.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Even though I could just record on my DVR episodes of Big Bang, I buy the DVD's so I can watch on my own time, as well as enjoy the extras. The extras to me is what truly sells the DVDs'. I do hope the producers make note of this.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|just a good enjoyable story to read. while reading I kept picturing the actors who played in the movie A time to kill.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Awesome DVD. Born too late to catch Zep Live. This is the next best thing. If you like Zeppelin you will like this. I really liked everything except the Knebworth Festival stuff. Something was off about that concert. Doesn't quite compare to the rest of the performances, though still good. Just get it if you can say you like Zeppelin.
031623480X|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK__WOW! This is the most informative, credible, heavily-referenced book on Gluten-intolerance and brain<br />health out there. The author is both a neurologist and nutrition expert. He says to AVOID ANYTHING WITH GLUTEN. Don't just buy Gluten-free breads and crackers and flours. Go wheat-less without the substitutes. He also says to get rid of anything with Gluten including shampoos and skin lotions and many other products that you would never guess had Gluten in them. He offers lists of products and foods to avoid, lists of things to remove from your kitchen, and lists of things to buy instead. He goes into biological detail why gluten is destructive. If you just read the first two chapters you will be 10x better off than you were before. I am well-versed in fat/carbs/gluten topics of the day but this book is at the top of the heap. Listen to this man.
0446691437|5.0|I love this book. Quick easy read when you know you are being a lazy ass, but can't get yourself out of that funk. It you are a creative person and want to be productive this will help you keep on task and get you motivated to keep pushing.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book. Yes plenty of drama but what a love story. You will cheer for Travis and Abbey!! I could not put the book down!! 5 stars for sure!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is a master story teller. Sycamore Row has so many legal twists you are continually surprised and held in suspense.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|There is nothing predictable about this film. In a cinematic landscape absolutely crammed with vampire movies, this one miraculously stands out, not only for the fresh spin on what is rapidly becoming an over-done theme but for the superlative casting, dialogue, and acting. Despite the obligatory gore, it never descends to the usual over-reliance on savagery instead of story. It is memorable in every respect and should have received more critical attention than it did.
B003B02O0A|4.0|I have always enjoyed John Grisham books and this one is just great.  Drama, setting, courtroom intrigue are the hallmarks of his great story telling.  Enjoy it as I did.  I usually read histories, biographies but it's good to read Grisham's fiction tales.
B00DZW4UPQ|5.0|The manga is a great adaptation of the novels that stays true to the flavor and characters and the fun while adding beautiful and expressive art to the mix.  Even if some of the characters may not look how you pictured them in your head, you'll be won over in a page or two on how well their expressions and actions are handled, and how true they are to how they're portrayed in the books.<br /><br />If you haven't read the novels, this is a wonderful series about an alternate Victorian age influenced by vampires, werewolves, and steam-punk science with a strong and funny heroine.<br /><br />Volume 1 covers the entirety of the first novel in the series,and I'm certainly looking forward to the rest!
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Simpley mindblowing, in the best of ways. This is a must for fans of middle earth and the greeat music of Howard Shore :)
0385342039|4.0|It was a little different from most of her books, but very readable. It was not quite as funny as usual.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This story is very well written. Engaging page turner. Also filled with nostalgia from 70's and 80's. I enjoyed this aspect very much!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Too much pop up advertising to be worth using.  I have taken it off my Kindle as a permanent solution.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game and it's also great for kids!  My son is 3 and loves to help me get the items.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It's horrible! Veronica Roth killed off everyone except the whiners and the villains. I love the first two books - Divergent and Allegiant - why I was so hopeful with this last book. I have read other books were main characters died but their death made sense. Not in this book. I was lost even more after finishing the book. I wished I didn't read it at all.
B00GGETKE6|5.0|Literally laughed until my sides hurt.  What an exceptional choice of cast!  Start to finish, a great movie.  SO glad I purchased it so that I can see it again.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory has quickly become a favorite in our home. Each season gets better and better. This season did not disappoint.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Too much smut not enough story's have nothing more to say about this book. I read the second one hoping it would get better. It did not
0142410705|1.0|Very dull book.  Couldn't get through it.  So disappointing since &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; and &#34;Paper Towns&#34; are both amazing.  This one seemed to have no plot.  Wouldn't recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Plot obvious and circuitous. I could not finish it because the plot was so simple and all outcomes could be predicted.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As always Grisham delivers a great story with impeccable detail and suspense. You feel like you are right in the story and you passed the bar!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Plugged it in, and only got a black screen on my TV. Tried every troubleshooting measure, and nothing made it work.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Exactly what you would expect. Simple to use app that has all the information you could want or need about not only the current and expected weather but also about any shows that are going to be on The Weather Channel.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Liked it want to see the. Movie now hear it is very good dad that she did not find her real family
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun and Cute games for kids. My nephew loves to play this game. It's not really educational. But it is a fun game with very nice graphincs that will entertain the younger kids for a good while.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|So far good game keeps you moving and thinking. What's my next move what to make now things like that. Fun all around I'll be on this for a good min.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has become an addiction of mine! The app and the website both are easy to use and great to find all the crafts and ideas you would ever need! If you use the website then you need this app so that you can take Pinterest with you no matter where you go!
006202406X|5.0|I loved this book.  I think Veronica Roth made some very gutsy decisions (especially for a newer-on-the-scene author) while writing it, and she did it beautifully.  While the major death is totally heart-shredding (definitely more than heart-breaking), her story telling is just perfect and helps us to heal along with the characters.  The story line in the book was great.  More and more secrets to be uncovered just like in the first two books.  I've got to say that I love a happy ending just like the next person, but I have a strong respect for &#34;real&#34; endings, too.  And this trilogy definitely has a &#34;real&#34; ending.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Loved it!!
B004VMUS9G|2.0|Simple and Easy app that does exactly what is supposed to. If you want more tone and alerts then you will need to by the full version but if all you need is an alarm then the free one is perfect. Please do not that the device must be left on if you want your alarm to go off!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Omg I just finished the book I am Cray Cray for this book it's tots hilar best book ever yes
B005LAII12|1.0|Even though I am in the minority for this movie I thought it was too crude to be funny.  I love the actors in this movie and it has a good story but I just couldn't get behind the lead character Ted and his ability to be such an influence on mark Walberg's character.  No need for the haters to hit me back, I'm entitled to my opinion and this movie was too disgusting for me.
B002ZG981E|4.0|my all time best movie of recent years !<br /><br />top acting by a very diverse cast<br /><br />amazing story line and an even more amazing ending !
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King at his finest, just like it was 25 years ago. Couldn't put this book down, it was the best book I have read in a long time & I hated to see it end.
B0030V0PEW|3.0|It just never got past the reasons why you should do a list.  I believe I have a better understanding of how a surgery room works and the complexity of flying a plane and building a skyscraper, but the author could have done a better job of taking the next step and connected the dots by showing examples of newly made lists and how they evolved over time.<br /><br />I found myself skipping sections that were used to explain why a list would be, or is important.  I was a believer way before page 100 and I didn't need to be converted through the whole book.  Unless this is given as a gift, most people who purchase would already be leaning in the direction of using lists and will find this book to be redundant.
B002G917ZK|5.0|A cultural icon and must see for everyone.  We love Audrey Hepburn. Classic movie perfect for the whole family. MAkes the perfect Saturday night.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|Iron Maiden is the best and greatest heavy metal band in the world. This show captures the band in its best. The performance is amazing, and the show was able to capture all atmosfere and all the energy that Maiden is capable of transmit to its fans in a live performance. The show mixes new and old songs and, as wine, Iron Maiden is getting even better as it gets old. Must have item for any good music fan.
0140186395|4.0|It's great to read a classic now and then.  Our book club decided to read this one and I'm glad.  The story is engaging and the writing is excellent
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun Game.

B008JFURII|5.0|It will be great!!!! Except I will miss a very<br /> great actor in Morgan Freeman.  He is one of the best of all.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|How can you go wrong with this boxset. Cast and crew are super funny and will guarantee a few smiles ro make you feel happy. Get them all!
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I loved it, anything with Jeff Bridges is good.  Started to actually like Ryan Reynolds in a movie....Cumin...who would have thunk it....
B000002AGN|5.0|My parents were of the &#34;Big Band&#34; era and this is the music I grew up with!  Their Dave Brubeck albums were my favorite and how excited I was to find out that I could get the ones I so remember!
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|Love the Downton Abbey series, it is the quality of dvd's that were disappointing.  The picture breaks up similar to when you are losing your TV signal and gets stuck in places. Not all the episodes are affected but with a new dvd I did not expect any flaws in the picture or sound.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I've been a huge fan of the Moody Blues for over 40 years. I have never been a huge fan of the solo albums, but do apreciate the music, etc. And of course love Justin, John, Graeme, Ray and Mike and all of their albums.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great!  Can set multiple alarms and wake up to relaxing sounds. Been using it for a little more than a year.  Love the app.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|this game is the most recent to have alot of styles for dressing up very cool scenes and places, so much fun lots of ways to play and dress up very fun
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing I was on the edge of my seat during Cato`s death I can't wait till catching fire is out!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie has a lot of haters and the only way to decide whether or not you like it is to just watch it. I am a Trekkie, particularly of The Original Series and the movies 2-6. I enjoyed Star Trek (2009) but always thought Nero was a weak villain. The antagonistic combo of Peter Weller and Benedict Cumberbatch (THIS MAN IS AMAZING) makes up for that to the 25th power and, in my opinion, really makes this movie the gem that it is. Namely Cumberbatch, who somehow disappears into every role that he plays. He really does steal the show in this movie, and in a great way. For being so skinny and pale, he made me scared to death for all of the other characters. That, my friends, is what they call stage presence and good acting with a good script.<br /><br />Is this a &#34;rip-off&#34; of &#34;Space Seed&#34; and The Wrath of Khan? No. I would rather call it a tribute. Most people who call it a rip-off and complain when things are different in the story apparently missed the memo that this is an alternate reality and therefore not a carbon copy of everything we were familiar with before. But the essence of the world and characters is still there. Also, I don't see how the action scenes take away from the story. There is a Roddenberry-esque tale being told if people would pay attention to the story. I won't call it a perfect movie either, naturally it has a few flaws. But the strongest point, and the most important to me when I watch movies, is how strong the characters are. I greatly enjoyed some more depth for Kirk, especially. Chris Pine plays a wonderful boy-Kirk who is in need of a major wake-up call, Zachary Quinto plays a great deadpan Spock, and Karl Urban is a friggin' fantastic Dr. McCoy. And Simon Pegg is hilarious, as always.<br /><br />All in all, the action is good (if that's your thing), the story is wonderful and thought provoking, the villains are awesomely hate-able, the heroes likeable, and best of all there is plenty of humor throughout.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I really like Marvel comics line of moves. As an older person it is really cool to see my comic book heros from childhood come alive
B004PHE9F6|5.0|A true cornerstone in the foundation of racing movies. If you don't appreciate the history and subtleties of F1 you won't like this movie.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|I am a huge fan of Sophie Marceau's. I really liked her in Braveheart. I wish she would do more american moves. This is a great story too!!
B00000342V|5.0|CURTIS ..... CURTIS ....  WE MISS YOU  BRUH !!!  YOU WEREN'T ONLY A GENIUS OF MUSIC , BUT YOU WERE A PHILOSOPHER  AS WELL.

I REALLY, REALLY  LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK AND THE EXTRAS THAT WERE ADDED ON.  YOU WERE DEEP BROTHER ....VERY , VERY , DEEP !!!!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Its okay, I really liked the storyline. It left me wanting more at the end. I really ecpected more from Will Smith.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Was a fun action packed movie to relax with on a cold night!  I love being able to watch movies at home.
1250038820|4.0|All over the world people like me fell in love with his way of portraying people photographically and fusing those images with respectful, thoughtful and thought inspiring snippets of text which made everyone who followed his page feel a connection with everyone else who followed it and with the people who appeared in the pictures and indeed with Brandon himself.Love it!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Do I even need to write an explanation?  Eminem is wonderful, CD came in great condition, no scratches, plays perfectly in my in-dash CD changer.  Album even came with all the paper that comes inside the CD case.
1400095204|5.0|Adichie's Half a Yellow Sun is a harrowing journey into the world of the Biafran War for Independence.  The book starts off in a happy, peaceful state as the reader is introduced to a young boy named Ugwu, the radical intellectual professor Odenigbo and Olanna, a brilliant young woman in love with Odenigbo.  Their middle class, peaceful and intellectual life style is disrupted when Biafra declares independence.<br /><br />Adichie navigates the reader through a graphic and realistic look at what it is like to have been one of these characters during the Biafran-Nigerian conflict.  In contrast to our three main characters, we are also introduced to a white Englishman named Richard, who is in love with Olanna's sister Kainene.  Kainene takes on a more male role versus the traditional female role seen under Colonialism.  She is a natural born leader managing the family business and eventually a refugee camp.  Richard takes an active role in trying to support the Biafran propaganda campaigns via writing articles portraying the desperate situation in Biafra for international newspapers.  He provides a unique voice in that he is an outsider who sees himself as resident of the newly born country.  Other characters disagree with him on this and regularly remind him that he is not Biafran.<br /><br />Adichie holds nothing back when telling the story of the complex relationships between the characters nor does she sugar coat the horrors of war.  She reminds everyone that while war is destructive, life continues on and evolves in ways we could never imagine.  Her characters are relatable and you will find yourself cheering them on in successful times and sharing their sorrows in more tragic moments.  The story takes unexpected turns as the African countryside unravels.  If you seek to understand the tragedies of war and how individuals radically change during one, this is a book that you should read.
158270208X|4.0|This was a gift for a young 16 year old girl, a daughter of a friend and she just loves it. That's all I need to say. I was a little surprised that it was smaller than I expected but she's very happy with it.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|&#34;The Notebook&#34; is a beautiful love story about two soul mates.  It is a movie that sticks with you for a long time after you see it.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|I watched it because it received rave reviews, but I was turned off by the first 30 minutes enough to not continue watching.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|This movie is wonderful for those who love to watch movies about alternate realities.  Father and son speak to each other on a ham radio.  The son is in the present day, but the father is back in the 60's.  There is suspense to the movie also which will keep you entertained.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|the book was captivating<br />The ending was a pleasant surprise<br /> Reading the first two in the trilogy and closing with this was great
B005XDHNF4|5.0|This set is fantastic. Added bonus: it included hair color choices for the bride and several flower colors. I was able to match the set, colors and all, perfectly (after replacing the groom with an extra bride) to the event. It made an excellent cake topper!<br /><br />Side note: The beautiful brides lived happily ever after. The Lego groom was left standing alone, but he had is glass (of whisky, I assume) to comfort him.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's an easy fun game that helps pass time and both my k<br />ids enjoy it also  fun fun fun fun
0142501123|5.0|Haven't given this book yet to my grandson since it arrived after Halloween but will keep it for him next year. I looked through the book and it seems like it will be entertaining for my 4 year old grandson.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Today this is my favorite album by Korn. It shows that they have matured, and really expresses the talent the band has to offer. Both lyrical content and musical instruments come together nicely to give what I think is the best performance to date.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Good movie. Not as juvenile as other Superman movies.  You can definitely tell Christopher Nolan had a hand in the production of this.  It has a similar tone as his Dark Knight movies.  Good choice on Henry Cavill playing Superman.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is pure Sci-Fi stuff. But it's a lot of fun to watch and it is interesting to see how they try to use some real complex science in a way that most people can understand.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It's a nice app to clean things up. I have no idea of clearing things off so it's great that this app does the job with no worries for me.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's very addicting, but alot of fun. That is until it takes a month to get past a level, that can get very frustrating. But overall alot of fun. Glad the app became available on amazon, hope to see more apps added.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Desperate Housewives My All Time Favorite Show Every season gets a five star rating as far as Im concerned. I wish they would so a movie or something like Sex in the City did a few years back.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Quite different than the movie, much more in depth. Thoroughly entertaining. Both an easy and.  Good read. Very very enjoyable
B008MEM24S|4.0|Is not as difficult (so far) as WMW, but similer fun with funny comments thrown in to bring a chuckle.
B006O6F932|5.0|It ships in the play set box, not an Amazon Box! Be sure you are home to receive the package so your children won't see it!<br />We have not set it up as it is a christmas gift but the box was much bigger and heavier than we were expecting!
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|On The Last Ship, Sting hits all the elements that make me love his music: Beautiful, complex melodies with great and varied rhythms; Lyrics that are thought-provoking, deep, intense, incredibly beautiful, and; a diversity of style that keeps both him as an artist, and the body of his music, fresh and interesting. Sting is an incredible story teller who combines poetry and music as no other musician of his time. The Last Ship is a shining example of his ability to tell a story to music, to let us see a vision he sees, brilliantly, poignantly, and with a musical style that is always fresh and exciting.
B002IVLH6U|5.0|Pearl Jam people ! enough said. buy this and all the rest of , and listen to a future hall of fame band .
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author's scientific background and his particular profession (brain surgeon), as well as his pre-experience skepticism of NDE's in general, lend a great deal of weight to his later evaluation of his own NDE as a real experience. Of course, one incident does not offer proof of extra-physical reality, but taken together with a host of others, the empirical evidence begins to add up. Alexander presents his evidence convincingly.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Chilling, scientific and well supported, this should be required med school reading.  With Taubes and Westman and Williams, we could save this country billions of dollars.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|This is simply not an enjoyable story. The movies is well done if you like movies that are somewhat depressing.
0316055433|5.0|The book is mesmerizing. Here's something I wrote recently for the St. Louis Beacon's &#34;Popcorn&#34; feature in which staffers present writings or ideas that have popped up in the previous week to engage or amuse or infuriate them:<br /><br />'The  Goldfinch'<br />In the writer Donna Tartt’s transportive new novel “The Goldfinch,” Audrey Decker, walking on the narrow edge of the precipice of doom, provides her 13-year-old son, Theodore, a lesson on 17th century Dutch painting that is at once historically informed and divinatory. This passage from her lesson concerns “nature morte,” the “still life.”<br /><br />The boy asks:<br /><br />“How long did it take him to paint that?”<br /><br />My mother, who’d been standing a bit too close, stepped back to regard the painting – oblivious to the gum-chewing security guard whose attention she attracted, who was staring fixedly at her back.<br /><br />“Well, the Dutch invented the microscope,” she said. “They were jewelers, grinders of lenses. They want it all as detailed as possible because even the tiniest things mean something. Whenever you see flies or insects in a still life – a wilted petal, a black spot on the apple — the [painter is giving you a secret message, He’s telling you that living things don’t last — it’s all temporary. Death in life. That’s why they are called natures mortes. Maybe you don’t see it at first with all the beauty and bloom, the little speck of rot. But if you look closer -- there it is.”<br /><br />-- Robert W. Duffy, associate editor
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat the ENTIRE TIME I READ IT. I loved this book
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Its a fascinating read. Part of the fascination is not knowing which is fact and which parts are fiction. I'm reading it for the second time right now, and it is just as rewarding as the first.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I wins this novel would have kept going. Every childhood is filled with melancholy. This novel is the best portrayal of that sadness and wonder.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really good game. Addictive, download this and you will not regret it. 5 stars all the way, so have a go now!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like the way this book reads.  I am a Grisham fan so I believe he does not write a bad book and this one did not leave me with any different thought!  I enjoy this series and shows all aspects of humor, what will happen next, and a lawyer you just can't help liking.  Just one darn great book.  I would have to say Grisham is the best and this book did not let me down.  Thanks John for another great book.  If you were here I would shake your hand!!!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it kept me riveted. Can't wait to read book 2. I like if I Don't know a word I can look it up
006202406X|1.0|I cannot believe that I waited over a year for this book. It was boring, it was nothing like the first two. And I am left feeling angry, let down, and as though I just wasted my time and energy. I wish I hadn't read any of the books. WORST BOOK EVER. Ms. Roth, what were you thinking?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a great story on how history can and possibly does get changed by every action that we choose
B0061S0A64|3.0|If you have lots of time, are more creative than I am, this would probably be rated higher by you. I really didn't give it a great trial so you might really be impressed. So many things to do with so little time.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this game when it was free and I play it on my Kindle Fire.  I don't remember having to give permission for anything when I downloaded it so I don't understand why there are complaints.  I have played the pencil version of this type of puzzle for a couple of years.  The addition of color really improves it.  There may or may not be spaces.  That makes it so much more challenging.  And i can't believe the number of puzzles.  I've had it for two months and I'm no where near finishing them all.  I would pay for it if I hadn't found it for free.
6304711905|5.0|A classic. One of my favorite movies. Had to get it. Kurt Russell and Val Kimlar are a fantastic pair. I still cry when Bill Paxton dies on the pol table.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|After the initial confusion of the different characters it was easy to get sucked in to their lives and the different links that tied them all together. A great read which has you thinking about the small things that can change lives. Highly recommend.
B00D6DVSAE|3.0|As the frame work for the Broadway musical aspect of the play Sting is financing and writing this CD is OK. As far as it being a marker in the formerly impressive solo career of Sting, this is not one of them.<br />Sting has been known to rehash his songs again and again and again (a point I find particularly perturbing). He does the same when he sets in on a particular style. If you are counting (and listening) this would be his 5th venture into a sound started on Brand New Day.<br />Yawn! Yo Sting! I understand that with fame and success you acquire the freedom to do what you want (pretty much saying \\"I don't care about critics, sales, or fans for that matter\\") but, take a lesson from Paul McCartney and give the fans what they want once in a while. A new innovative style would be awesome.
B005LN5UOC|2.0|I have always used true gaming headsets (rarely do I use these earpieces). I suppose that, maybe, because I am so accustom to the full head-sets, that this earpiece seemed bizarre and awkward. It is much too large for female gamers, and the camo design is laughable. (A matte black would have been a much more marketable choice). My brother actually laughed at it when he saw it ... he wondered if we were going to start hunting virtual deer. Silliness.<br /><br />The quality here is what you would expect for the price. Therefore, as a serious gamer, you should just invest in a better headset (even if it means that you get to purchase one less game this month). Obviously, the [[ASIN:B0042R81XU PS3 Bluetooth Headset]] is \\"tried and true\\" (always a great choice ... smaller, comfortable, and effective!) And, my boyfriend and I are big fans of [[ASIN:B0053OLY9O Wireless Stereo Headset]]. (Yes, they are pretty pricey, but once you use these, you probably cannot fathom buying a cheap little earpiece).<br /><br />Don't cut corners when it comes to your headset. Buy something more comfortable and more professional.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Sir Paul is back. Look I have been a Paul guy since the Beatles. I was ridiculed in the late '70's (and the '80's and the '90's and, who am I kidding, most of the 2000's) for believing that Paul would return to his hit making form. With \\"New\\" he has. The songs are infectious and get into your head. My 8YO son loves the CD. The song \\"New\\" was featured in the movie \\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2\\". My son and I both jumped out of our seats when that distinctive voice began to sing (yes, he knows McCartney. Just like his old man).<br />It is also so good to know we still have Paul and Ringo. What treasures they are.<br />Sadly the greatness of this CD may never be known because it will receive no radio air play.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Although the Chromecast does everything it is supposed to do, personally I think a set top box with a dedicated remote is a better solution than using an Android phone, tablet or iPod to control the device.  Picture quality is excellent, network set-up was not terribly complicated, and the form factor is certainly attractive.  Be aware, however, that if your television does not have a USB port available to power the Chromecast you will have to use an AC adapter to do so.  Early press on the Chromecast indicated it was powered by the HDMI port, but this is not true; it requires an additional connection for a power source.
B00F3VOL38|2.0|I don't like this CD because they \\"played\\" me knowing that avid Beatle fans are rabid for anything \\"new\\" from the Fab Four. A large majority of these songs appear on the first BBC CD. These are just mixed differently and admittedly are recorded live.<br />If you are a \\"rabid fan\\" like me RESIST THIS PURCHASE and you will avoid that \\"Ripped off\\" feeling.
006202406X|4.0|I never write reviews for books, but I'm going to start with Allegiant. I will attempt to stumble over my very complex thoughts on this book in an authentic way. Read on to find why I give this book four out of five stars.<br /><br />So let me start by saying that I can definitely understand the reasoning behind the negative reviews of Roth's writing style in Allegiant as compared to Divergent and Insurgent. The writing in this book was (at time) very weak compared with her first two books. The page-turning aspect was not there. There were whole chapters where I wanted to scream \\"Please stop attempting to describe aspects of the setting that mean nothing to me!\\" Likewise, I was underwhelmed by the lack of character depth that was presented in this book, which left me feeling rather empty toward some of the struggles the different characters were facing. If you're reading a book, and have to revisit who characters are and where in the series they originated (such as Cara, or Shauna, or Amar), perhaps somewhere the author has failed to make them stick in your mind. At times it did feel more like a draft than a refined and finished product, so do not be surprised if you feel slightly cheated in this way; I know I did. I was interested to see how she would pull off the dual narration from both Tobias and Tris, but I was not wholly impressed. The reviews where readers have complained that they felt too similar are, unfortunately, correct. I too had to fumble a few pages back now and again to remind myself whose head I was inside.<br /><br />However, these struggles on Roth's part to finish the series are (in my opinion) forgivable. I can overlook the fact that her writing in Allegiant was often lackluster compared to her first two books, and this is why: The narrative is compelling. Sure, it lacked the strength of the first two books. It lacked the character depth that I expected with two narrators, and it did not push me forward quite like the first two books in the series either. But the narrative was brilliant.<br /><br />I'm not one to compare two totally different books or movies, but if you've read the Hunger Games, hear me out. Collins certainly had a leg up on Roth as far as character development and reader attachment goes. I never cried in the Divergent series like I did when Rue died, or when Cinna was taken away, etc. etc. So on that level, I would give Collins a better rating. But, Roth succeeded in the same way Collins did by creating a world that is so unique you just can't put the books down. So really it all comes down the finale of both series. When I finished Mockingjay, I put the book down and sobbed. Not because it was so good, or because Prim died, or because whatever sad things you might feel after a good book with character deaths. It was because the story had ended in such an unsatisfactory manner. I understood what Collins was doing. She was saying to the world, \\"no one wins in war.\\" In the end, Katniss and Peeta are never fully whole and only in the tiny one page glimpse of their children do you get even an ounce of hope. But despite the incredible lesson Collins was trying to teach readers, I felt VERY cheated. We had invested so much in these characters, we had come to expect so much, and here she was just giving us a page or two of \\"wrapping up\\" a story that couldn't be wrapped up so shortly.<br /><br />I say all this, to get to the ending of Allegiant. So many people have ripped Roth apart for killing off Tris. While it was sad and disappointing to lose the heroine, it was a better ending than Mockingjay and the death of Prim and fade into nothingness that overtook Katniss and Peeta. And here's why: agency and hope. In the end of Mockingjay, Katniss never once really belonged to herself, she never acted on her own, she always was forced to be a pawn. But Tris was not a pawn. She owned her own story and she made her own decisions. Was her sacrificial death not in character with the self-sacrificing character we've known and loved since book one? She was still the Tris we have all come to adore. She was strong, resilient, and heroic until the end. In the end of the book as we follow Tobias in his slow recovery from his grief, the narrative suggests this one truth: \\"Life damages us, everyone. We can't escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: we can be mended. We mend each other.\\"<br /><br />This one line sums up the entire series. It is only through helping one another that we can be whole. It is not one faction, one race, one genetic type that can heal the world. It is through collaboration and teamwork. Roth's book deserves four stars not because it was perfect and effortless, but because of the truth she gave us and the decision to stand behind Tris and not cop out of killing her. Tris was a true hero because she gave her life for a world where people all have a fair chance at life. Katniss wanted to hide, but Tris wanted to fight. The world where Katniss and Peeta survived was less promising and more depressing than this world where our lovers don't end up together. Because Tris brings new life to Tobias, in the form of changing him for the better. She is able to leave behind the pain and suffering of her past, and in doing so she leaves behind a legacy of strength and courage. She gives hope to a hopeless world.<br /><br />And that is a true feat.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|What can be said about Katy? She improves every CD. Every song on this CD is one of substance. Her beauty doesn't hurt either. The song with John Mayer is the most beautiful in my opinion.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham did his usual wonderful job of developing the characters in this book. If you're a legal junkie, this is a must read.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Whimsical is a good word to describe how this game makes me feel. I have so far really enjoyed this game! I am looking forward to unlocking more levels.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|This movie is not a joyous movie to watch. Denzel is always good, but there are no likable characters in this. The logic on the legal side is weak. There is a message, but I think it gets lost. I would not watch it a second time.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really truly loved this book....up until the end. I do not have time to leave a detailed review on how this book upset me, but I will say that anybody who quit before finishing just because they heard bad things, should pick up the book again and read through to the end. Then you can decide what you think.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Great action/sci-fi movie.  It is fast paced, excellent special effects and does not take itself too seriously and just goes for what it is.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is an amazing author, but he can sure rip your heart out. These books are pure perfection. Amazing amazing amazing
B003G4W49C|4.0|Pros:  This is a fun & quick read that I thought was very entertaining.  Had some themes that made you think as well.<br /><br />Cons:  Not a beautifully written piece of literature.  Nor did I expect it to be.<br /><br />I felt the same way I did when I read the Hunger Games.  I was very entertained and glad I read it.  I enjoyed it as an adult while it is probably best suited for teens.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I have just started reading this series and I really like it. I plan to read all of them. The hero(s) are all damaged by the work they have to do and there is an almost poetic congruence between the death and destruction and the restoration work he does. If the main character wasn't so glum, he would be impossible,like a depressed James Bond, since he is so good at everything he does, but his sadness really works and he doesn't value his skills. The Israelis seem pretty real, for the most part.
B007ONQ42O|5.0|One reason, and one reason only!  Lizzy Hale!  She's got some massive pipes and can pump out tracks that either get you driving to fast or can make you think of times past.  Love this band!
B00C5R8364|3.0|There are some many good authors developing the same plots these days that a terrorist novel was to have something special to stand apart. It was a good read but the lead character left me uninspired. I don't require a Jack Reacher but a little more human qualities would have worn well.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a wonderful way to see My Friends' comments, pictures, and activities.  Facebook has improved since first starting up.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham always gives a good read and returning home to the characters of A TIME TO KILL showed great story telling. His window into the rural South is both gentle and realistic while not ignoring the horrors of the past.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Well done but not too very exciting overall.Main characters are weak .Clark and Lois actors are not big star material.
B003ZWTGKU|4.0|I too give Kaufmann, Koch and the rest of the cast very high marks.  However this video is seriously compromised by the way Benoit Jacquot, the stage and video director, insists on showing singers before they come on, or cutting in mid-action from the stage to distant shots which include both stage and orchestra.  For an opera to be viewed not merely as a concert but as theater, the willing suspension of disbelief is as essential as it is for any play.  We're told Jacquot intended to &#34;make it impossible not to believe what the singers are expressing.&#34;  Nothing could be more destructive of that goal than jarring shots that shatter our involvement in the story as they remind us that these are merely singers awaiting their entrances, or singing on the stage a few feet above the orchestra.  What on earth can he have been thinking?  And where is Brian Large when we need him???
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Excellent! Super dynamic cast,effects and story line.Exceeds my expectations many fold.I loved every moment of it! Will buy this for sure.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Fun physics game -for a while.  It becomes repetitive at times, and as you move through the game, almost impossible. After about 15 to 20 minutes I become frustrated and exit, only to come back a day or two later.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|A very exciting storyline with great  acting and keeps the underlying sub-plots mysterious attention glued throughout the movie.Bought it. Buy it!
B00GINENG0|5.0|I think this app is really funny and I really appreciate the app the notifications are funny I would rate this app five stars. ;)
B003G4W49C|5.0|A world of strong characters and even stronger bonds that cannot be broken but are tested and tried. A boy who sees a world that he wants to be loved in and works so hard to make sense of it. With an ending that is the beginning of old life. A Good read that kept me turning the pages.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Best romantic movie ever! You will laugh and cry, guaranteed! Beautiful scenes from Ireland. Stellar acting and Gerard Butler is so hot:)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can get it where ever I want it too. I have found this app very reliable and I use it every day. You can check local and national at any time. Just love it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I Love the different sounds that help me fall asleep fast . I like that I can have it run for as long as I want and that it shuts off on its own .
031623480X|5.0|I've read several books on gluten intolerance and I like this one the best.  It does get into a little more detail than I care about however some people will be interested (and I can skip over them).
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Keeps your interest.  Some of the technical stuff is to be skimmed if you are not into that.  Overall a good read.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Always a classic, no matter what age you are. They did a wonderful job with this movie and Gregory Peck is marvelous.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I am amazed at how easy and quick it was to find this gift for the holidays.  I typed in what I was looking for and it popped up.  From start to finish the entire process took less than 5 minutes.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I saw it in the theatre in 3-D. It was much better than the original. great in three dimensional on the big screen
B0090XO57C|5.0|I love this series.. and David Attenborough is a living legend. Everything about his set is Pretty Perfect. And the price is right too!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I love Denzel Washington. We were surprised when it wasn't just about a troubled flight, but more about a troubled man. Probably a difficult movie to watch for those people who are intimate with any substance addiction.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I had never read it and wanted to before seeing the movie. I had heard about it and friends liked it. The story is original but I guessed where it was going about halfway through. Written for the &#34;young adult&#34; market at the time? Good to read as it is referred to often.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Fun movie if you like action and adventure. Why else would you watch GI JOE if you didn't like bang bang go USA! Interesting plot twist.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is great game for kids to play on there free time. If you like temple run you will really like subway surfed and the updates.  I hope you like the app if you get it.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|The game is fun, maybe even addictive, but in order to have any real advancement and build up your kingdom, you need to buy crowns. The crowns come within the game very slowly and you just end up frustrated. Not sure how long I'll play this game before I just remove it from my kindle. Sure, it's a free download because they expect to nickel and dime people with crown purchases.
B001NIA27E|3.0|not oscar material but very entertaining.  that mother-in-law is a piece of work, special effects are good., &#34; thank you NASA!&#34;
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Thank you for the quickness makes Christmas a lot easier when you don't have to fight the crowds just sit at home on your computer.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|I am very happy with my Ziggi and have used it to create many math videos for my community college algebra students.  The device works well.  I wish I had spent a little more money for the version that includes a light.  Nonetheless, I have no regrets about owning a Ziggi.
B002VBV1S6|5.0|Fantastic read. One of the best fantasy books I've read over the past years. Intriguing characters, great banters and the twist will put a smile on your face
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!  Occasionally an update will cause some glitching but it's usually fixed by the very next update.  Awesome additive fun for the whole family!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game. Crazy addictive. Tons of fun. Sometimes insanely frustrating. But who doesn't love that combination. Play for fun...for time killing...for aggravation :)
031632406X|5.0|This is a true story of true American heroes. The word, &#34; hero&#34; is overused  and abused... that the word or &#34; title&#34; just does not have the meaning that it use to. These men are true Heroes, who offered their lives for the  people of the United States of America, and one who survived . All serving in the military deserve our respect  and after reading this book, I think one will want to wave their flag and thank God for such men and women who are serving our country!<br /><br />I purchased the paper back because I wanted to be able to bend..mark and read over and over. It is a must read for any veteran.. or any American who wants to read the true story of  our military  serving  for us and dying for us. I salute all of our military  and thank God that Marcus Luttrell wrote this book and the movie is coming out of these brave men. God bless you all. This will change your life!<br /><br />I received this book 2 days after ordering  and  received it in good condition, as I always do with the things I have ordered from Amazon, so far.<br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving, as we remember our forefathers who also suffered and died for the cause of freedom. I thank God for the freedom we have to even celebrate this day! Merry Christmas... to all who celebrate and I praise God for my blessings, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a little hesitant to read this book after all ready seeing the movie. But I'm glad that I did. It is very well written and I enjoyed it as much as the movie. It's very descriptive and easy to read. There weren't any parts that were dragging on. I will be reading the next book asap. Hopefully before I see the next movie.
B008Q0B0I2|4.0|Good fun movie, I love a fun fantasy that is not all about battles,  This fits that bill and good cast, Robert Dinero in a dress, what can be better than that?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun but frustrating at times! You can get stuck on a level for days or weeks! Buying help is an option but if you persist you can get past and move on. Highly addictive, great graphics.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|I am a big fan of Cumberbatch, so far I have like everything that he has done and this is no exception.  To watch this man act is always a joy.  This is a very moving little movie and has humor, pathos and pretty scenery.  The relationships between the friends felt real. Interesting cameo by Hugh Bonneville, it took me a minute to figure out who he was.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book, although not a great literary work, is so engaging and topical that I loved all of it.  Celebrating very diverse generations and best of both while satirizing our dependence and fascination with Google.  Fun book.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Great game very fun for young or old. Just wish quests didn't take so long and buildings not so expensive
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game, but I think the first one was better. The first one was a little harder and that made the first one better.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Ok I like this movie a lot. I love that it shows a girl determined to get what she wants, only to find what she thought she wants is something totally different than she actually got. This is not just a dumb blond movie, this could be very empowering movie for a tween or teen girl to see. When told she wasn’t smart enough for Harvard Law School she proves that she is.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Daughter loves this game and she is six year's old. I would highly recommend this to little children. Many choices of number of prices.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a good story and it let me know how Danny turned out. I liked the fact that he young girl he helped turned out to be his niece and it made the ending that much more poignant. I recommended this novel to my friends even before I finished reading it. It has been a good ride but I wished it was a little longer. I would have liked to know that every member of the True had all got what they richly deserved. All in all, a very good story.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Very hard at times, no real instructions to know what to do.  Also, not long enough.  Needs more instructions on how to play.
B001B7CNY2|1.0|Save your money. There are a lot of better films out there, about submarines. Fiction or not. Just a bad movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story was always changing.  I thought I had it all figured out then another turn.  What a great read for the holidays.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Seen all but the last 5 episodes, amazing series. Such win. Wow. Best series. Wow. Doge meme worthy, such Meth, much win. Have 20 word minimum when all I wanted to say was amazing. Such doge.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't put this one down.  Keeps you guessing from the first chapter until the last.  Can't wait to see the movie.

B00FMF3R0I|5.0|What would one not like hearing hear.Luckly this time the put in the Beatles exchanges with the host like you will find on the bootlegs.Again as in the first collection some real gem ,my favorite is Chuck Berry's &#34;Talking Bout You&#34; .The live recording in Hamburg as well as this show how great a singer John Lennon was.The most striking thing that gets you is as George Martin said of them &#34;they were very charming&#34; and that shines through in this collection.So I suggest you just buy it now have it for the new year and enjoy as we in the U.S. set to celebrate the 50 th year since the Beatles landed in Amercia.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Microarray develops her characters beautifully. You soon feel as though you know them intimately. While the ending wrapped up a few loose ends, I was disappointed in the ending. But, perhaps there is another story to tell using these characters...!!
