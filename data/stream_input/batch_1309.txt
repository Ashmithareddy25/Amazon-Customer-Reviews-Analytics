0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus is purely magical. Opening its covers is like stepping into a dream from which you will never want to wake; every element of the story is almost painfully beautiful. If I were dropped on a desert island with only a single box of books, this book would be in that box.  The Night Circus is the story of Celia and Marco, a girl and a boy chosen and trained by two different magicians to compete in a game of illusion and strength. The game commences when they are adults, and it is played in a dream-like circus that travels the world. One illusionist travels with the circus while the other plays from afar. They fall in love, neither of them realizing that the game will only end when one of them dies. The circus impacts more and more lives the longer it goes on, and not always in a good way. Alongside the interplay of Celia and Marco is the story of Bailey, a boy fascinated by the circus who will play an integral role as the two story lines merge.  When I closed the book and the dream ended, I started to realize that the book wasn't perfect. The characters could have been developed further, (I feel like the defining characteristics of the main characters were quite similar), I would have chosen a completely different ending, and yes, almost every author would benefit from a good editor. However, those things don't stop me from loving the book for what it is. Erin Morgenstern's setting is enchanting, and her story is gripping. I can't wait to see what she writes next!
085738371X|3.0|This product was a gift. I purchased it because it was a great price and you got three different books for your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. lots of fun. hours of enjoyment ... very addictive trying to unlock each mini game. would recommend for all ages.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Great game!!! Lots of fun on the Kindle!!!!! It keeps your interest and keeps you guessing what comes next. Love the game.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Even if you don't know much about cars or NASCARs, Cars is such fabulous entertainment their is no reason not to love it from beginning to end.  Pixar, similar to Toy Story, puts heavy duty race cars in a human light -- not one character in the movie is human.  Lighting McQueen an arrogant, rookie race car is aiming to win The Piston Cup.  If he wins he'!l get a major endorsement and be one of the elite cars of all of racing!  However because of his arrogance and his lack of respect for people in the field of racing, he finds himself friendless. So happens, his life takes a dramatic turn as he is lead into a run down town by the name of Radiator Spring off Route 66.  He meets a several fellow town's cars, especially those that help impact him in a positive light as it reaches it's climax.  The amination of the film is creative and brillant use of color.  The sound is vibrant as you really feel like you are on a race track or driving down a highway.  The voices are pretty good, my favorite of course is from the late Paul Newman who plays Doc Hudson.  For what it's worth the movie is terrific!  It is definetly a family movie and Pixar once more proves their excellence in pictures by using cars to tell fun, thoughtful, and real storytelling.
B005O30Y5Y|4.0|My daughter had this on her Christmas list and was very excited to find it in her stocking.  She is the one who chose the 4 star rating.
1401307450|5.0|I try to read 1-2 musician biography/autobiography per year.  I find the life styles to be the most interesting.  As far as this specific genre of book....I felt the book was great.  Very well written, entertaining and with great insight.  If you are a fan of the group it will help explain some of Anthony's creative lyrics.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|My daughter wanted this for Christmas.  She rated this part 4 stars as well as for part 2.  It would have been nice to buy the 2 as a set rather than each one individually.
B005H0IW6W|1.0|I ordered the Michael Buble Christmas CD for my wife on Dec 10th, so that I would receive it shortly before Christmas, and she could decorate the house and all that jazz while listening. However, the record didn't show up by Christmas Eve. In fact... it didn't show up at all. I never got it. Ended up spending another $12-$15 on it in itunes. Thanks for the X-mas bummer. Not happy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are so fun, you have to try them. There free and there's many to choose from. me and my boyfreind love these game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|all around great app. simple to use and understand. can search words or phrases. choose from dozens of translations. what's not to love?
B004VMVTNU|4.0|The app has lots of features and flexibility, but it's not too hard to figure out (although definitely not as simple as some other alarm apps, either).
B0043URV5U|5.0|I just got the CD, put it in my Lexus and didn't want to stop driving.  Unbelievable!  Love the music!  Just placed an order for a friend's birthday.  The East Coast will be ROCKIN...

B00436GNVC|2.0|This cd is just plain boring.  There is nothing to snag your attention let alone keep it.  It is very disappointing from someone who promised to be such a great artist.  This cd even ages Duffy as it sounds like something from decades ago.  Hopefully she will do better in the future
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Glad to know I'm not the only one with that problem.  Would give 5 stars if that bug were fixed.
030788743X|5.0|After finding out this book was on \\"Best Of\\" lists, I had to read this.  This book hits all the right notes on so many levels.  Wade Watts, in 2044 Oklahoma City lives in a dystopian future. But he is obsessed with a Steve Jobs like computer genius named James Halliday, who was rumored to have hidden his vast fortune in his self-created computer system named the OASIS after he died.  The question is, what would happen if he found the legitimate first clue? What would he do? Who would he trust? And who would stop him from finding it?  The book is not an amazingly rollicking thrill ride but hits all the geek levels perfectly. You have Sci-Fi, Computers, 1980's Pop Culture, Anime, Music and more.   When I read the book, I visualized it as a movie. I had no clue that Warner Brothers had optioned the book into a movie.   Read this. You will LOVE THIS BOOK.
B003L77GRO|1.0|May as well watch it online over a modem, you'd get a better quality than this DVD release of Dexter Season 5.  It has less quality than a widescreen VHS tape played on a 50\\" HDTV.  You can barely make out any detail on people's faces and they sometimes cram 4 episodes into 4GB of space on the DVD.    I've tried watching this on a PS3 which has very good upscaling and then through my computer just to be sure and from all of the other reviews it looks like Showtime just shoveled a steaming batch of you know what onto us.    Not sure why they couldn't even spring for a 2-layer disc for this release.  I think they just want you to buy the Blu-Ray release.  I recommend going to your local library and renting this for free rather than paying anything to watch this if this is the kind of quality Showtime wants to give its loyal paying customers.  I haven't finished the season, it's just painful trying to watch these discs, but halfway through it's a decent season, if a little repetitive.  Hoping for a good finish on the second 2 discs, though I'm probably going to wait until the library gets a Blu-ray copy in and then watch that rather than giving Showtime any more of my money!   If you plan on watching this on a 27\\" or smaller TV then you may not notice it too much, but on anything bigger I can't recommend buying this DVD until Showtime has stated that they've fixed these issues.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I bought calengoo because I mistakenly thought it was the only way I could get the goole calendar on my kindle fire...stupid, stupid, stupid...All I needed to do was: download a browser, access my calendar then put the google calendar icon on the carosel...out $6, but wiser
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game but the instructions need to be more clear because I couldn't understand some of the games. like the sushi one. al it said was touch the green part and so I did and I couldn't do anything..... its a good game but Instructions!!!
B004EPYZP8|1.0|Why do movie directors believe a movie should be shot with a cheap camera and/or a rookie camera guy?  So much zooming in and out, shaking... keep a paper sack near if you get motion sickness!!!
B004SBX112|4.0|Awesome app. Works great on kindle fire. I only rated it 4 stars because its like the orignial, kind of, with different scenery. But overall, is great.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The advertisments appear so much (After almost every game)! But I love the games they're very very very addicting. cool games:)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I think this is a great app....I have it on all of my devices as well as all of my family's devices. I seamy enjoy the reading plan's.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun and colorful game and good responsiveness so far but have only played two times  Mostly my teen son plays
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This show is fantastic. The writers work tirelessly to achieve a seamless plot that weaves together all the relationships and connections that ordinary people might pass over. Consistently, the actors deliver emotional and tear-jerking performances (see the Damon/Elena kiss in The New Deal or any of the Bonnie/Jeremy interactions.) Just when you think you have figured out what is going to happen next, the show sends you a curveball that comes completely out of left field and makes you remember why you decided to watch these realistic and fantastical vampires rather than the much-glamorized Twilight versions.  All in all, a WONDERFUL show...and Damon is SO HOT!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great set of simple but addictive games.  Nice strategy in making us unlock games, making you feel you earned it.
B0057MFA42|1.0|The audio is about 1/2 to 1 second behind the video.  Absolutely unacceptable.  I can't believe this passed a QA check.<br /><br />Considering this was a delayed amazon release and is a known issue there is absolutely no reason for this to be sent in this condition.  It is and issue clearly being ignored by Geffen Records.<br /><br />This would be a 4 star review if the product wasn't fundamentally flawed.  As is the video is almost unwatchable.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|This is now my favorite Johnny Winter CD. The musicians playing on this CD are sharp, the song selection is good and Johnny's voice and guitar have never sounded better to me. I am into rockin' blues and this album does just that.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This Series has to be one of the best I have ever seen in my life. Besides being very strong and manly oriented it is based on the true story of the great man Spartacus, a slave who defied the most powerful empire at the time, the roman empire. We can say he is the first slave abolotioner of the history of the world. The scenes, the action and the plot i one that will involve you in the movie and will make you want to shift it yourself. It is a must have series
0307472590|5.0|¡Simplemente, hechizante! Carlos Ruiz Zafón reúne todas las carácteríticas de un extraordinario escritor.  Sin temor a equivocarme, es la mejor novela que haya leído. García Márquez, Humberto Eco, Isabel Allende y hasta Jostein Gaarder se asoman entre las página de esta maravillosa e interesantísima novela de misterio, romance, suspenso y aventura. No pude soltarla hasta que la terminé y solamente me tomó cinco días. La recomiendo a todos los que se digan amantes de la buena lectura para que conozcan a un autor brillante y una historia que les dejará sin aliento pero con ganas de salir corriendo a leer la próxima. ¡Excelente!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are really fun others are not. some of the controls are confusing or don't work correctly but in the end its free so its worth it.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This album is great.  When Within Temptation decides to tell as story, they go all out.  The album follows a group of dead people, headed by Mother Maiden, brought back to life to meet out justice to depraved criminals who would otherwise go uncaught.  While each song contributes to the story, each stands alone as well.  This album has a gothic heavy metal feel with orchestral overtones (similar to Evanescence).  Be warned that if you buy this album you may become addicted and purchase the comic books that go along with the album.   If you like their self-titled album, you will like this one too.
B006LYMILI|1.0|Do not buy Blu-ray. There are incompatibilities between disks and players.  The movie is ok, but the technology behind Blu-ray is unreliable. The movie stopped in the middle asking me to update the player which already had the latest firmware version. I will never buy another blue-ray.

B0063IH60K|3.0|its nothing fancy.  just a game to pass some time.  the price is right...free.  I'm sure there are better solitaire games that will have better options.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|great selection. decent quality sound. perfect for talk radio. love it! I highly recommend it for anyone that spends much time in the car.

006107327X|5.0|This is a really good art book. If you are an artist or a fan of the show this is defiantly a must buy. This book also shows you the different style change when some of the animators left to go work on the superman tv show. This is an amazing book.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|One of the best 2010/2011 albums to date. Every song, every note...catchy and easy to relate to. Very poetic and crafted well with complex layers.   I love this band. I will always see them in my town and I wish them continued success.  Very positive and talented young musicians. Hopefully with a continued bright future.  Buy it! You won't be disappointed.
0783225849|5.0|This is a good classic movie. I had good service and got my item sooner than expected. Customer service is very professional.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a fun and easy app. I would have liked to be able to get points by getting points in games on general vs having to gain a certain amount.
1401322425|5.0|The book correlates to his show. Recipes are so inviting and easy plus the narratives makes me feel like I'm right there talking with him. Fabulous is an understatement. I'm sending a copy to friends.  Judy

B005NKIQ26|5.0|A must for all JB fans (like my daughter). The Christmas holidays are over, but it's still the most played cd in her rotation.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game for relaxing before bed, I could become addicted very easily. I love playing this game,  I don't know how hard its gonna get, I hope it doesn't!
B00074CBIS|4.0|This is one hilarious movie. Queen Latifah steals the show. Fallon holds his own, but Queen nails it. Queen & Fallon's chemistry seems to work pretty good in this comedy. It may not be either of the actors greatest roles, but it is a fairly entertaining comedy. This is definitely a 'feel good' comedy that keeps you laughing from start to finish.
B000063UR1|5.0|Silent Running clearly had a major influence on future films such as Star Wars and even Wall-E, which has a similar theme.  Excellent special effects considering no CGI (this was the early 1970s).  Highly recommended.  The book is good too.
B0002X314C|5.0|When I first heard John Legend sing the \\"Ordinary People\\" song, I had many questions in need of answers. I thought...where is he going with this? Where's the beat, the rhythm, the soulful sound like those before him? Is he a folk singer? Who is this guy? Then he wrote, produced and performed many other songs, and I began to get into the groove of his sultry, laid-back, smooth sound, and I thought...this guy is good. Then, when I heard the song, \\"So High\\", man...I was hooked! So now I know John is and will always be...a Legend.
1451627289|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King novel, nor am I a fan of his works that were turned into movies. Thus, I was leery of his newest work. I read a sample chapter on my iPad Kindle App and instantly became hooked. In fact, I immediately left to buy this book from a bookstore, because I had to continue reading. This was the fastest 850 pages I have read in a very long time and I was sad to see it end. The ending was somewhat of a let down, but the story was as a whole so vivid and captivating I would read it again.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I really like this remote app. I use logmein on a daily basis for work but for the price this is just as good. I have some issues woth typing but no complaints other than that.
B002ZG97EC|1.0|Item received is NOT what was advertised or ordered.  Ordered 3 disc Despicable Me and received Blu-Ray/DVD only combo package.  Not that it matters, the Digital Copy would have been expired and useless anyway even if I had received it.  Guess I should be lucky I only paid $9.67 for the movie.  Would have just Tivo'ed it off HBO had I known this.  12/31/11, really?  Its only been out a months!  Aren't there false advertising laws?  From now on I'm only going to buy at Best Buy, Target or Walmart where I can view and hold the item and read all the fine print before purchasing it.  Never will I order something like this again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great . It requires skill and attention to pass some games.  some games are challenging but I love a challenge
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its quick and fun little games you can play. Not the best and exciting games but they get time moving
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This is an excellent fast-paced movie.  I like both of these actors and I wasn't disappointed with this film.  It is one of my favorites.  The disc was in excellent condition and plays flawlessly.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very intuging nd fun game and it extemly enjoyable I fell in love with it fast and fun
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have it on the fire and it works great.  I love being able to open it so i know the weather without having to go downstairs to check.  I have also programmed other locations that I want to keep tabs on.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great way to use a Bible when u forget your hardback at home. i read it when i wake up and before i go to sleep.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app works amazing. nice being able to easily switch between translations. also nice being able to have access to different languages.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think this is an awesome app. I'm thirteen, so I am trying to expand my Bible knowledge so I can grow as a Christian and a human being. I do not mind the need for internet. But, unless you have a hotspot, this isn't your Bible on the go.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Stay away from Ultra Violet. Deserves ZERO stars. Total crap!! Other reviewers are correct in the \\"Stay away\\" advice. What a major scam!!!!!
B002SXXGBC|5.0|I heard of Gentle Giant in 1973. Finally saw them twice in one night (thanks to Bill Graham) we were to high to drive home. So he gave us dinner seats at 555 Batery Street (I forgot the name of venue) They blew ME and everyone away. I was on my toes the whole first show. I just wish I would of seen them while I spent 4 years in the Milatary in Germany.<br />Saw plenty of obscure bands there so I have no regrets (Steve Hillage) (GONG)
140053271X|3.0|I recently bought a Nook and when I bought it home for the first time, I was impressed. The user interphase (much improved over Nook 1st gen) was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list UI of the new Kindle touch. Holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the Kindle touch desperately lacks. Hardware and software wise, the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use e-Reader.  However, when I started to look for books to purchase (they were about investing if you were curious), out of the five books I tried to find, I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted. I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews, and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are, but the truth is, B&N still has a ways to go.   I am aware the the Nook supports e-pub which allows it to read generic pdf files (something that the Kindle can't do), but one of the features I look for in e-readers is convenience. Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient. If only this device had the Kindle store on it...  Bottom line: When you buy an e-reader, you're also buying into the manufacturer's entire ecosystem. With the Kindle, you're buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer that's not going away anytime soon. With the Nook, you're buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the e-reader space.   Two word recommendation: Research selection (before purchase)  I hope I've helped.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|When I heard this was a Cinderella re-telling with a cyborg sci-fi twist I thought the idea was weird. However, when I started reading it, I went from scratching my head at the idea of it to being awed by her creativity. It was like Cinderella meets Star Wars (the high-quality originals, not the prequels). Let's be honest - the mixing of traditional and sci-fi is what made Star Wars great and Cinder does just that by mixing fairy tales with a futuristic world. The Cinderella elements are very loose making the story unpredictable because just when I thought I knew what was going to happen something crazy would happen instead. And just when I thought we had left the path of Cinderella, she would unexpectedly bring the fairy tale elements back. And then when you think it can't get any better, she layers it with end-of-the-world type stuff and a mutated human race. MIND BLOWN. The world she created was unique and even though it was sci-fi, it wasn't to the Star Trek extreme. The futuristic world had a lot in common with our world which I loved. This was one of those books where I was still reading it at 2 am with bloodshot eyes even though my kids would be awake in four hours - but I couldn't stop reading! Despite Cinder being a cyborg, she was incredibly easy to relate to. And the love story with the Prince felt like a real relationship and not mooning over the cutest guy in town. Even if you don't like sci-fi, pick up this book and watch the pages fly by - you won't be able to stop turning them.  I had a hard time rating this book. I kept going back and forth between four and five stars. I loved the whole book but the very ending kind of fizzled out in a \\"To be continued...\\" way that reminded me of that one  Jerry Seinfeld joke. HECK YES I'll be reading the next one to find out what happens next, but I wish the ending had more closure to it.
B0063FGG22|1.0|Comparing the look of the 2000 non-Blu-ray DVD to the Blu-ray version, the Blu-ray is sharper, but too much contrast -- to the point of ruination in some scenes.  Overall, the 2000 non-Blu-ray version has a better look.  Already owned the 2000 version, and was looking forward to a new definitive version -- very disappointed with this product.  Not throwing it in the garbage -- giving it away.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is addictive but the.games tend.to be a.little.boring... I don't.understand why I cant stop.playing.lol. I also wish.it.was faster.at getting points.to buy more games
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Picked it up on a whim and read it straight through over a weekend. Looking forward to the author's next book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|what can I say, it is free, and seems to be huge on content, and all the creativity that has been put in in trying generate money for himself is commendable
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I researched a number of different cases and decided that I wanted:   a light-weight case that would would still enable me hold the Kindle in one hand  an easy-to-use stand for watching video  a case that was designed for the Kindle.   This case met all my criteria. The case is not plastic all the way around--just the section that holds the Kindle inside securely. The case also has a hand strap, which makes it easier to hang onto while reading or walking around. The front is a flexible rubber with felt lining on the side that faces the screen. The front cover feels very flimsy, but it folds to create the viewing stand or folds flat while reading. The case seems expensive for what it is--and I can not attest to its durability yet--but after using it and looking at other cases, this one gets the job done.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app let's me controll my PC with ease from any where. Works good on 4G and Wifi and OK on 3G.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|just fun. its something else since I got sick of angry birds. its now how I pass the time while wasting life away
0634049011|5.0|This book is nothing short of amazing!!!<br />I have been playing guitar for 20 years this month, and never took the time to learn much of the theory as it was always too much to memorize...<br />Firstly, I recommend this book to the novice who just wants to learn a few songs just to impress some ladies - on up to the professional guitarists making a living on their 6 stringed' friend.<br />Beginners: Don't be threatened. The first chapter is designed to get you familiar with the guitar. This book promises to make accomplished guitarists out of people first learning guitar within a year, and I believe with the discipline ANYONE can do it.<br />Intermediate: This may be your next step to becoming one of the greats. This would have set me way above the rest of the students in all school and garage bands at my age.<br />Advanced: (I consider myself to be between this and the next) It's not too late! You will make light work of this and jump leaps and bounds from where you left off. It will probably be most exciting for you.<br />Professionals: You will already know a lot of this. This will help you fly through the book. By showing you shortcuts, you can access more notes, faster than you're able to drudge up from memorized scales and repetitive riffs. And of course one of the great things about being a good guitarist is being able to teach right!?<br />This can be the ultimate workbook for your students. They will, (with your help) learn quickly too, and you may be able to expand your \\"skill range\\" of students you're able to teach. And your reputation will reflect. If you're anything like me, I can always use help with being more creative soloing and this book does that for me too.<br /><br />This book has ways, only for the guitar, to get around a lot of the boring parts of theory that you have to memorize. For example, instead of learning what note every fret is on the board one by one (which is important if you want to play professionally), this workbook shows you five simple patterns to memorize. You build on these patterns in each chapter until you can play any mode of any scale from anywhere on your guitar! You will automatically become familiar with the names and be able to figure out what every note is if you haven't yet memorized that the 2nd string 11th fret is a B flat.<br />You'll learn everything you need to know about the fret board just by having fun with these root shapes and patterns.<br />I learned to play by ear and over the first few years, I had been forced to memorize some of these root shapes, so I already knew somewhat of the importance of these patterns. I can and have jammed with some great musicians over the years, but one thing I felt I couldn't do very well was solo, unless I was familiar with the key and had memorized riffs I could slip into variations of the melody to sound good, and even then, I'll still hit an accidental and sound just as good as my one year old! I never took the time to memorize but a handful of scales; never enough to improvise or be creative with my solos.<br />By getting familiar with these patterns and learning how they connect to each other and can be played everywhere, I found they would be the foundation to every chord, arpeggio, and scale that I did know and ever wanted to know!!<br />You won't regret this creative way of looking at the relationships between the scales and arpeggios, and in a light funny way of presenting it to you. The book uses hands on, verbal exercises, and plenty of diagrams to show and explain to every kind of learner what exactly is happening in each chapter. Highly recommend!!!!<br />Rob - Dadgigsopics
0307292134|5.0|Fantasy does not get any better than The Song of Ice and Fire series! George R.R. Martin has been writing for many years, and his books are always excellent, but he has surpassed himself with this series. It took forever to finish, but was worth the wait. The boxed set is beautiful! I only wish that the set included A Dance With Dragons.

B003UYUR10|5.0|I really enjoy these types of movies. At their heart movies such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time are supposed to be fun and adventure filled escapist entertainment. This is where the movie succeeds. First of all the movie is a visual palette of wondrous colors, scenery, architecture, costumes and characters that transports the viewer to another place and time. Secondly the story has all the right elements from heroism, bravery, treachery, betrayal, familial love and loyalty along with romance and laughter. Thirdly the story is epic in scope but intimate in its execution.<br /><br />Based on a video game, which I have never seen, the story follows the adventure of Dastan a Prince of Persia, splendidly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, who had been adopted by the king as a peasant living in poverty on the streets. Raised along with his adopted brothers Dastan leads his brothers and their armies to capture the city of Alamut where he meets the city's beautiful princess Tamina,  portrayed by the enchanting and stunning, Gemma Arterton, and he comes in possession of a mysterious dagger with time traveling abilities. That is the gist of the story and I will not go into great detail on the finer points of the story.<br /><br />The movie is a fantasy and it is fun and enjoyable. If you enjoy fun, adventure filled fantasy epics the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a great popcorn munching movie to escape into for a while. It will be time well spent.

0307946711|3.0|I picked up One Day because its a movie. I really Like Anne Hathaway's Charm and looking at the previews made me curious. But I drag my feet when it comes to TV/Movies... etc. Realizing it was a book I purchased it for my Kindle and all the way through I kept having this nagging feeling like \\"I am not sure if I like this book.\\"   When the accident happened I felt bad... not really for Dexter, but for Em. Throughout the story yeah She evolves into this individual... she's normal. She had huge youthful aspirations, none of which she could actually achieve at that point in her life anyway and fell into a place of \\"well this sucks-- now what?\\" And it seems like she drops to the bottom of the bottom when she dates a guy who we as the reader know is completely wrong for her (not that Dexter was that much better either).    Dexter on the other hand had a silver spoon in his mouth and was stuck on himself. He just knew he had good looks, he just knew he had talent... as it was so greatly said about Dexter he had \\"it\\", whatever \\"it\\" is... And the worst part is he knew it.   What held me captive was the waiting for when the two lost souls mature enough to a place where they are officially ready for one another. The whole book felt like the two were just never mature enough to handle each other one on one. And it never happens. Em was cast as a support beam placed in the slot which many women find themselves being if they are waiting for \\"I know he's Mr. Right, but he's got to come to his senses first.\\" She has to put up with the bull and mess with a mop and bucket on the sidelines before being rewarded with the diamond.   When Dex and Em do officially wind up together I was sorely disappointed. It seemed at this point the author realized \\"Well the story has gone on long enough and there's not much more I can do to keep these two apart. I used every plot device known to soap operas... I guess I can put them together now.\\" It was rather painful, for lack of a better term at 240AM, to watch. It was kind of \\"Well I'm single now because my marriage failed and you're KIND of single..\\" \\"Oh I can't because I'm-Okay!\\"   In the end Dex doesn't *really* some to his senses. He hasn't grown up really. He tempered down only because \\"someone in their mid thirties no longer has an excuse. In their twenties it 'oh i'm young'...\\" He had no choice but to try and relinquish and even when He loses Em for good he moves on with someone else to have filled her spot with a tiny bit of resistance. Bah!  Perhaps I might've been satisfied with him remaining single because he developed some personal growth, but Dex is Dex... and is always with someone, never alone long enough to develop. Part of me even hoped that maybe years had gone by and he manages to remarry his first wife after they both changed into better people (Cuz they married under duress, really and both relatively immature about it)   All in all, the writing was so-so. The character development was almost nonexistent... I was awfully disappointed and have grown less keen on watching the movie because I just don't see myself reliving this story. Sorry, I think this one is surely a swing and a miss.. SO why 3 stars? I actually finished it, didn't I?... there had to have been SOMETHING interesting about it.
1591840562|2.0|As others have said, this is not a guide to \\"starting anything.\\"  It's a guide (using that term loosly) to getting VC funding for your \\"hot\\" \\"innovative\\" \\"high growth potential\\" Silicon Valley startup, and to growing that company in its early stages.  There might be some good tidbits in here if that's actually you.  And if you're planning something else, it's certainly worth thinking hard about whether the \\"lean startup\\" approach (as presented here by Kawasaki and elsewhere by many others) can be helpful.  Much of the content is highly superficial, and it gets pretty tiresome to read over and over again about the example of the Macintosh launch -- especially given that Kawasaki doesn't even explain what exactly was his role in that effort, and given that the Mac launch seems, based on what he describes in the book, to be the only real, big success of his career.
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|As stated in a previous review, local streaming on this app runs like a DOG on Kindle Fire. Its important to note (and somewhat promising) that it makes absolutely no difference what your quality settings are, everything will stutter in exactly the same way. This, combined with the fact that other streaming services like Amazon's work beautifully leads me to believe that the problems with streaming in Plex are not due to hardware deficiency. More likely its an issue of software optimization on either Plex side, or the Android side, or both.<br /><br />Hopefully after some updating it will better, but right now, for the Fire it is a waste of $5.00.

I was very late to The Hunger Games party, but after reading a review that described it as \\"the complete opposite of Twilight\\", I figured I would give it a shot.  And am I glad I did.  This book gets the action started quickly, and it doesn't stop.  You will be turning pages until your fingers get tired.  I don't want to spill anything for those who haven't read or heard about the books yet, but just imagine Blade Runner meets Running Man with teenagers and wilderness.  You can't help but draw parallels to our young men and women abroad in the war.  Just read it.  You will not be disappointed.

0756405890|5.0|After finishing the fourth book in the SoIaF series by Martin I was at a loss. Then my research led me to The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. After reading A Wise Man's Fear last year, I can honestly say that my excitement for the planned finale, The Doors of Stone, is on par or greater than that of Martin's planned Winds of Winter. This book and its sequel are that good, if you haven't already, pick this up. I envy you and the journey you are about to embark on.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind had me from the jump. The story is broken into two parts, the present day events surrounding our protagonist, Kvothe, and the epic story of Kvothe's life which he is self-narrates in the first person. The present day world is where we begin and it's a place of danger and impending doom. The setting and the characters are intriguing. Who are these guys, where are they from, what is this dangerous creature that is showing up and why? All of this was enough to pull me in. Then we learn that this is only part of the picture. The majority of the novel focuses on Kvothe's fabled past, spanning from his childhood years to young adulthood. I won't go into specifics because that wouldn't be fair, but know that Kvothe is a man of legend. But why?  That is the major intrigue of the whole yarn. Present day Kvothe's average appearance seems to betray his real age and vast experience. The scribe who comes to record his tale can hardly believe that Kvothe exists in the flesh; the tales of his life more fable than reality in the minds of most people. But what has he done?  Why the fame?  Why a kingkiller? These are the answers we are looking for as we progress though the book, and the series.<br /><br />As we read we learn of Kvothe's motivations that originate from his childhood experiences. These motivations are the drive that pushes him to risk his life to unlock secrets about a shadowy group with connections to his past. Kvothe, as a cocky, yet extremely talented actor and musician gets himself into many sticky situations, but is usually able to devise a plan to get out. Also, being a relative genius, he learns quickly and thus is able to pick up all types of skills to assist him on his journey. And the journey is a fabulous one. The setting is a fairly realistic post-medieval world (complete with map) but right underneath the surface you'll find magic and mystical creatures, and fantastic lore of what came before and what may still be out there.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is an incredible read that is mostly a light-hearted chronicle of Kvothe's early adventures; juxtaposed by the sense of danger and doom felt in present day. What did Kvothe do in his life to make him a man of legend and how did he get to this point?  That's for us to find out as we progress. And I'd be remiss not to mention Rothfuss's delivery of the book. This is one delicately crafted story that you can savor with all of your senses due to the level of detail and care put into the world and its inhabitants, both past and present. With all that being said, I haven't said enough about how much I enjoyed this book and its sequel.any sticky situations, but is usually able to devise a plan to get out.

B001NPDCFQ|5.0|Received this just after Christmas and am absolutely delighted with it! Having read some of the negative reviews I've compared it with my 2 Disc SE DVD and ALL the extras are included on the Blu-ray version (it's just that the contents sheet doesn't list them all, and the navigation system is different to the DVD). Yes, there is some grain in some scenes, but to remove it would mean over-digitalization and make the picture rather lifeless. One customer even complained that it wasn't in widescreen! Er.. excuse me but they didn't make films in that format in 1944 and to release it that way would mean topping and tailing the image and quite rightly provoke a storm of protest. We should be grateful that these timeless classics are being released in HD, so I do wish people would stop whinging and also get their facts right before posting on Amazon. Look forward to more treats like this in 2012. How about \\"Raintree County\\"?

Not only that, the choice she is forced to make, could very well ignite a war between the Vampires and the Werewolves. This one kept me glued to the screen waiting to see what the outcome would be. You could feel Bella's emotional strings being tugged hard in this one. You won't want to miss out on this one that's for sure.

B0036EH3U2|4.0|First let's get this out of the way.  If you're thinking of buying the Blu-ray version expecting to have some nice visuals don't bother . . . seriously.  Even a regular old DVD can provide better visuals/picture than what they ended up with here.  They shot this series in 1080p, but they've gone with this \\"Artistic\\" grainy effect that really just ruins it - it's like buying a Super Computer to do Word Processing.  This is a prime example of \\"Artistic\\" gone absurd - pretty much like the whole \\"Politically Correct\\" thing.  I watched most (if not all) of the original BSG series way back, so I expected this to be pretty much an updated remake.  It is, and it isn't.  The Cylons are more varied, as there are both Mechanically and Human-like versions.  The plot varies quite a bit from the original BSG line, and it's definitely a bit darker.  There are a few boring episodes, the spiritual aspect is a bit puzzling, and the ending is a fair bit different, but overall it a pretty good series.  I took off a star for the visual quality, and considered taking off even another since it (visual) is so disappointing.

630529142X|5.0|The Waterboy is a very funny comedic movie. The movie is rated PG-13 because of some nudity but other than that it is perfect for children to watch. The main idea of the movie is that the kind Bobby Buchea is put in a predicament when his mother does not want him to play football. Although the movie was hilarious the visual effects were only mediocre, this having to do with the time period in which it was made. The movie was a perfect  length and is a great movie to watch on a rainy day.  Adam Sandler does a fantastic job as Bobby Buchea from when he is making jokes on the field while other people are \\"making fun of him\\" to when he falls in love with an ex-con. Henry Wrinkler who plays the head coach of the Mud Dogs does a good job when he hallucinates and when he talks to Bobby before each game. Jerry Reed who plays the ex partner of \\"The Fonz\\"(Henry Wrinkler) is great when he insults Bobby and when he calls him a \\"mommas boy\\" and that he is good for nothing.  In the movie Bobby learns to overcome his social problems and wins the Burben Bowl for the Mud Dogs. This is a lesson to be taught, that if you give something your all you can achieve anything. The actors do a fine job portraying this and overall they are a great cast who played each part well. I think that this movie is a classic and will be watched by many people in years to come and this movie is also one of my all time favorite.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Overall, the film The Help was a hit. Making 203,427,931 dollars in the box office, it really struck families across the Untied States. The director Tate Taylor and producers Michael Barnathan, Chris Columbus, and Brunson Green really got across the message, \\"stand up for what you believe in.\\" The film was based on the powerful and inspiring novel by Kathryn Stockett. The story takes place in the early 1960's in Jackson, Mississippi when racial prejudice was flying everywhere.  The movie focuses on one main character most of the time, a woman named Eugenia Phelan. She is in a social crowd with women that have all married early and have hired their black maids. While her racial prejudice is merely an illusion to her friends, she, an unmarried woman, who has had to time to explore and she realizes she must take a stand against this. She decides to write a book on the opinions of the maids working in Jackson.     I don't think any other actors could have portrayed this story line any better than these actors did. Emma Stone, who is usually known for doing humorous roles, really stepped outside of her comfort zone and did an outstanding job in playing Eugenia Phelan. She showed how this character always stuck to her values and thoughts no matter what. She also showed the significant bond created with two maids in Jackson, Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), who should not be ignored for their exceptional performance as well.    Although this movie does make a strong impact, it did not quite live up to the great novel. The novel really goes into detail of all the ways blacks were treating aggressively and unfairly. The movie kind of glosses over those parts and makes everything all happy.  In the novel, the author makes sure to emphasize racial hate and gave many examples of it throughout the book. The movie did not live up to this.   One scene that is truly empowering is the scene when all the maids finally agree to help Eugenia write thebook. Most of them were hesitant at first, because of the risk of getting caught. But after a maid was arrested for no reason, they realized they had to make an impact to everyone and tell the whole world how awful they were being treated. This scene really captures the moment of whites and blacks coming together as one.    Overall the movie left you with a feeling of wanting to make a difference. It showed that standing up for what you believe in is important and was overall a fabulous movie. The movie is PG-13, but really any age from ten and up could see it. Besides some foul language here and there, the movie is perfectly appropriate for mature kids.
1451627289|5.0|Steven King has outdone himself and all of his previous works - although they were great.  When I read the concept for this book, having been in my late teens in 1963, I thought there was no way anyone could do justice to the concept.  How could I have doubted Steven King?!?!?!  His ability to make ever the most impossible and impalusible of everything seem possible is demonstrated in this book more than in all of his other work.  What a wonderful book.  Don't plan to accomplish anything other than read once you start.  Impossible to put down.  This book is a MUST READ for anyone who remembers that day, 11/22/63, and for everyone else it will be a quasi history lesson, fun read, and a challenge!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams tends to be the Founding Father we know the least about.  This miniseries, based on the McCullough biography of the same name, rounds out the man who is probably more directly responsible for the way our government runs more than any other of them.  Paul Giamati is amazing in his portrayal of probably the most honest politian we ever had in the presidency.  But even more interesting are the portrayals of Wasington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Franklin, Sam Adams, and most especially, his wife Abigail.  I learned so much about what they were like by watching these amazing portrayals of such famous people.  It takes them off the pedestal we tend to put them on and shows them for the flawed, but great human beings they were, bringing revolutionary ideals that had never been tried anywhere before.  Try this series, you won't be disappointed.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|HBO has become the gold standard for top quality, adult entertainment.  While good family fare is fun at times, it is nice to have a morally complex character and story.  Boardwalk Empire is merely the next one of these shows.  Steve Buscemi is amazing in his portrayal of Nucky Thompson, the corrupt, scum ball treasurer of Atlantic City during Prohibition, and the crime boss of all vice in that city.  Buscemi, good in almost anything he does, pulls out all the stops in a great leading role. Behold hecwas in danger of being typecast in his Reservoir Dogs type roles, this brings a slimy, unctuous bastard to the small screen that has tons of charisma and nerve.  While quite bloody and sexual, as most HBO shows are, it is rarely gratuitous.  Hard R territory for you parents out there, but definitely worth a watch.

B00000IQW5|1.0|I guess they can't all be hits, can they?  I was sorely disappointed with this movie from Spielberg.  I had not seen it in the theater, but it was during the maturing of Steven Spielberg.  Up to this point, most of the movies he made were hoot hollering action films, almost all of which were great.  Hit after hit they spilled out.  Around this time (1987-1990), Spielberg started taking on more adult-themed movies, probably because he was sick of being considered the kid.  Maybe he thought he wasn't be taken seriously enough.  He started with The Color Purple and then Empire of the Sun, and then this.  This movie actually looks more like a Lucas movie with the nostalgia-heavy themes.  I had heard from most people that this was a great film, but when I saw it, I was severely underwhelmed, which does not happen to me often where Spielberg is concerned.  I found that plot trite, slow, and not really all that interesting.  Frankly, it seemed to me to be a more serious version of 1941, which Spielberg himself disowned.  There was nothing about this film that would make me rave about it.  It is not bad, it is just not great, which is a problem with Spielberg because the bar is so high.  The movie is beautifully made and has all the hallmarks of the greatest living director today.  It just was not all that interesting to me.  I wish it was, because I heard so much good stuff about it and I was really rooting for it to be another great film.

1439190275|5.0|This book discusses in detail the research and science unerlying low carbohydrate diets as first described by Atking.  The book includes some new information and some recipes with more fruits and vegetable which makes the practice of limiting carbs for good health and weight loss more reasonable and healthier - in my opinion.  I have used the information in this book go guide my eating for the past 6 months and have lost almost 40 pounds and had my daily blood glucose readings go from 140/150 to the upper 80's to low 90's (the normal range).  I feel the best I have felt in years.  This approach outlined in this book may not work for everyone but I found it easy to understand and implement and very effective - with virtually no cravings for high carb foods.  For me, restricing carbs was a life changer - I not only lost weight but I learned a new way of eating.  The message is that one cannot simply loose weight and then go back to old eating habits - this book will only work for you if you change how you heat for the long term.  If you are in love with doughnuts and processed foods and aren't willing to give them up - this book is probably not for you - however, if you are you able to understand and follow the information presented you will be amazed by the results!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|It's both at once--gunfights and spaceships. I'm amazed to see how many reviewers didn't like it.  I found it not only exciting and suspenseful but full of twists and shifting character  relationships, so that one has many different plot lines to follow. I have to admit, there are  rather a lot of glitches in the continuity, where they need to forget about, like, the guy is  tied up so how was he able to get up and do something essential to the plot. And there is feeling  that the conception of the monsters and their lair owes a lot to Ridley Scott's Alien. Still,  the movie just shoots along in a compelling way, and, bit by bit, all the mysteries laid out  in the beginning are explained. Then, too, there is more here than just, as the title says,  our side against their side. There's the theme of trust among strangers, and respect between  (human) adversaries. Because Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford start as mortal enemies.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|I recently bought a set of Grado SR80i headphones when I finally had $100 to spare.  Many reviews I consulted wondered how these might perform with an iPod after a bit of a signal boost from an amp.  I had never used a headphone amp before, and though I love the sound of my Grados, it kept gnawing at me that I might be able to make them sound even a little bit better.  (I had tried the next model up SR125 and concluded they weren't worth the extra $50).<br /><br />This baby intrigued me enough that I decided the tiny price was worth the risk.<br /><br />It is hard to say if I really can tell a difference because it is hard to know for certain that the volume is the same when swapping back and forth between the Fiio and no amp.  The amp responds to the volume control of the iPod as well as having its own volume control.  It seems to me that the sound is a little fatter - bass has a bit more punch, highs a bit sharper, sound stage slightly expanded.  I play the amp flat and use the equalizer on my player.  All I know is that my great headphones sound even a little more great, whether because the sound is actually augmented (which I am beginning to believe) or simply because - fool that I am - I am just listening to them slightly louder.<br /><br />This will drive my headphones much louder than they can play on their own - to head banging levels - but that is not important to me as I never listen at max volume even without the Fiio's help.<br /><br />Unit is very small (about the size of an iPod Nano) and seems quite well made.  So far I have not found it too awkward adding another link between the player and the headphones, but I probably look a bit more geeky than usual if I don't take the trouble to try to hide all this gadgetry (the heavy cable of the Grados is problematic enough).<br /><br />I do listen through this all the time now, but since it's bought and paid for why wouldn't I?  Know what I mean?
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I only had a chance to play a few of the games included in this package before I got completely fed up with the advertisements. They're not just little banners on the side of the screen; they are full-blown pop-ups that completely interrupt the game, and many of them seem like scams. Free or not, no time-waster of an app is worth sifting through all that garbage.
1451648537|4.0|I really enjoyed Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, but I am not sure what to make of it. Part of the allure for me is that I am close in age to Jobs and came of age during the rise of the PC computer. I was an Apple diehard, but went through the painful process of moving to a Windows-based PC when my company decided it did not want to standardize on a closed system. Like the Macintosh, Apple's more recent products are excellent, but also closed and I am reluctant to invest, financially or emotionally in Apple products.  It is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether this book is about Steve Jobs or about Apple. One could argue they are one and the same. It is clear that Jobs was obsessed with the company and considered it his creation, his baby.  What is less clear are his relationships with people. Yes, we get it. He effectively used his RDF to get what he wanted and he was a jerk. Yet, he had family and friends who were extremely loyal to him, but the book really doesn't explore those relationships or why those loyalties existed.  Also, I am disappointed given the emphasis on his business acumen and experience that there is not more in depth exploration of business lessons learned.  Overall, I found this book extremely enjoyable, but too one dimensional.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Youversion app is incredible.  Not only do you get different version of the Bible to help you in your Bible studies,  but, you also get devotionals that are very helpful in your Christian walk....love that.  If you are like me sometimes I just want to listen to the scriptures, and this is an excellent app for that.  In a nutshell, this is the most used app on my Kindle Fire and Android phone.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I was a little unsure if I should buy the zoom after reading many reviews. After the price dropped I figured it would be worth a try. I bought this because my living room tends to be small for using the Kinect during the holidays when everything is rearranged. When I first connected it to the xbox, it did not find me, in fact the little preview screen was pitch black even with all the lights on. I decided give it another try in the morning so I would not need extra light. It still didn't work.<br />  When I finally got it working when trying out the your shape game, I showed up at a angle on the screen and would flicker in and out even though I was not moving. I tried it on another game and it could not find me at all. Sadly for me this was not worth it even after the price drop.
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|Both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are released on Friday 13, 2012 in Germany and are available from amazon.de at a very reasonable price. The discs are the same as in the recently released Double Blu-Ray set that was only available in the Saturn shops in Germany. Picture quality is good (Koyaanisqatsi) to very good (Powaqqatsi).
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app as a devotional and Bible.  it's easy to read, and has options to change text and Bible translations.  the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is b/c it requires wi-fi and cut out on me during my Bible study in church with only 2 bars of wi-fi.  if I could download my favorite translation, it would totally receive a 5 star.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Filled with fun games worth the download. But games are not all perfect. some minor glitches in the coding but for a free game on a kindle its worth every penny!

B00000ING2|4.0|This Coen Brothers classic often gets overlooked amidst the rest of the duo's daunting catalog, which is a shame because it would be a shining beacon in almost any other director's portfolio. Tim Robbins, Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh don their roaring twenties accents and breathe in boatloads of snappy dialog as the centerpieces of a closed-doors corporate scheme that never seems to quit escalating. Though the climax is a bit of a cop-out, the rest of the film works magnificently as an allegory for the sins of capitalism, the failures of an impartial press and the temptations of glamor we all stare down sooner or later, while managing to be cute, creative and charming the whole way through. Excellent stuff.
0439023513|4.0|I loved this series, but this final book left me a bit disappointed. It rushed the ending so much, and left me wanting to know more. I recommend the series 100% anyways though.
B005EY2XFC|2.0|Like leafing through an old high school journal, this was difficult to get through without cringing at every bad line and self-absorbed thought. I'd recalled the dialog as being fairly pretentious, even through the rosy-red glasses of fond remembrance, but nothing could've prepared me for just how poorly the whole package has aged over the last decade and a half. Try as he might, Brandon Lee never comes close to getting over the hump as a serious dramatic actor, even in a mostly-action setting, and the half-baked revenge formula he plods through does little to challenge convention. Though its unique visual identity is still a strong point and the soundtrack remains gigantic, there's really little else to celebrate about The Crow in a modern setting. For its time this was a fantastic comic book adaptation, but given the strides made in that field over the last ten years it really isn't even a fair fight any more. Let it live on in your memories; modern viewings do nothing but disturb a settling grave.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Not only do I get to build a better relationship with God  but I can take this app with me anywhere!!  iPod touch, Android and my Kindle Fire.  I felt like I've been missing out by not reading the Bible daily.  The reading plans are manageable too.  Best download yet!
B005KR6OBM|4.0|When I received the DVD box set, I was happy to see that they were wrapped in cellophane still but one of them was wrapped separately. This was somewhat disappointing to be seeing as how I am giving them away as a gift, but that's just a small issue that I can live with. Other than that, I was very much satisfied!
B001CJJWWA|5.0|I bought the Blu Ray version, which has two Amy concerts. One is the original I Told You I Was Trouble concert and the other is from Porchester Hall (BBC One Sessions). I like the Porchester's concert. Amy's vocals are slurry on the original and she is a little more focused on the Porchester's. My favorite song she did was Know You Now. I'm a big Amy fan and I love how she talks to the audience and somewhat interacts with them. On the Shepherd's Bush Empire concert (original) she still interacts, but I don't know what it is about that one. I barely have the urge to watch that one. I still recommend the DVD/Blu-Ray disc its Amy at her best.   RIP QUEEN WINEHOUSE

0307477479|5.0|It seems crazy to me that The Hunger Games gets almost five stars and yet this incredible work gets such a low rating by the readers on Amazon.  This is one of the best books I've read in years.  The writing is supple, intelligent, muscular, and courageous.  The characters, all lost, full of yearning, are fully drawn creations--believable and surprising.  And the chapter done as a PowerPoint Presentation is brilliant.  I read this book in two sittings and I can't wait to read it again.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Amazing cd, I love Katy Perry and I am a big fan of his, she's the best...<br />The shipment was fast and perfect!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Emma Stone is the revelation here. What a great performance! She plays a modern day Hester Prynne, but with a twist.  There are times when the writing gets a little too cutesy, but on the whole it's a smart, comedy that is surprising, quirky, and charming.  I highly recommend!
0743289692|5.0|If you've ever wondered what the Western World went through for several hundred years to get to the enlightened freedoms we know today, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's memoir is as good a glimpse as I've seen outside of my own emancipation, & that's what my husband said when he gave me secondhand hardback copies of INFIDEL & NOMAD for Christmas... way to go, Hubby, & thanks ;-}<br /><br />Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells of her life in moments that fractured her soul, administered by the men of her culture, & the subjugated & emotionally feral women in her family ~ all intent on breaking her spirit into submission cuz that's what the holy book of her father's religion says they must do to their females.<br /><br />By way of introduction she writes of the fracture we all saw recently on the news: the assassination in Holland of Theo van Gogh by a Muslim immigrant who shot the movie director on the street in broad daylight, slit his throat & then stabbed a fatwa paper onto his dead chest. Theo & Ayaan had made that brief movie SUBMISSION Part 1, wherein certain Quranic verses are seen floating over the shadowed undressed body of a woman.<br /><br />After repeating the generations of her father's family, as Somalis are wont to do to identify tribal, clan & subclan roots & perhaps find family ties, she tells of how her parents met & how her mother chose her husband which was, as you will see, highly unusual. Then come the blissful years of monkey life under the Talal tree with her mother's mother, her older brother & baby sister outside her home.<br /><br />Now that you're thoroughly lulled comes the first betrayal, the first act of terror: your grandmother, she of all desert wisdom, brings a strange man into your home, then she & two neighbors trap your older brother, then you & then your sister on the floor & he attacks you \\"down there\\" with a knife. Then he sews you up, leaving a minute hole for your urine to drain. Grandmother tosses you on your bed with your legs bound & forbids you to move. You are six years of age.<br /><br />Of course Ayaan's brother is merely circumcised whereas she & her sister have only a scar now: no labias nor clitoris. They will know only agonizingly traumatic sexual intercourse (apparently lovemaking between husbands & their wives is not expected, only varying degrees of rape) & must have surgery to reopen them to give birth, thus many first time mothers die as do many girls from infection, filthy tools & conditions immediately after. I came across female genital mutilation back in the '80s when I worked for an alternative medical magazine & published an article by an ER doctor who'd cared for such a patient & wanted to know more about it: were any US laws about this horrifyingly unnecessary excision & did the people performing them have a license. I gathered it's more a cultural thing than Islamic as it's not mentioned in the Quran, however, beating your wife is & that happens with sickening regularity, as Ayaan attests to of neighbors back in the Old Countries & in European immigrant housing: the lines between culture & religion are often blurred.<br /><br />Now add her father's political bent & all of a sudden they must flee to Saudi Arabia, the most Islamic & repressive nation in the world, North Korean notwithstanding! Without her mother there to help & having to do everything on her own with no man around to accompany her outside, Ayaan's mother begins to degenerate, taking out her frustrations & furies on her oldest daughter who already is doing all the housework. Now the mother administers daily beatings even as she finds the purest experience of her religion in a nation of men who despise & cloister all things female.<br /><br />Our heroine grows a-pace & their father moves them to a large Somali enclave in Nairobi, Kenya where she starts school, is fascinated & inquiring which is not so good cuz that's not how Islam is taught, especially to girls. There is no dialogue, no questioning, only total by rote submissionto the lesson. Somewhere in there a teacher is hired & so begins a struggle of dominance which he ends by beating the you-know-what out of his student, breaking her skull. After hospitalization, she survives, except numbers will forever be difficult for her to grasp.<br /><br />Each page of INFIDEL pummeled me awake: I could not get enough & kept wondering what would tip her over the edge. How would this tall, exquisite jewel of a woman get out of the culture that was bound & determined to break her into the Islamic version of a Stepford Wife.<br /><br />This is one riveting coming of age & coming out story. I was howling & cheering, furious & elated as Ayaan Hirsi Ali told her stories from first memories, into teenhood & the devout faith Sister Aziza inspired, to her troubled baby sister, to her cliche of a brother, to her parents' separation, to her mother's breakdown, to her father's arranged marriage for her to a distant relative in Canada, to her sojourn in Holland & her education & enlightenment, her stint as a Member of Parliament to meeting Theo van Gogh, to death threats & Dutch bureaucratic rejection of her citizenship, to eventual escape to America.<br /><br />A word about when she first arrived in Europe: she finds everything remarkable & gushes over how clean the cities were, how miraculous indoor plumbing is & how magical were the buses that arrived when the timetable said they would. Her insights are not only revealing of where she came from, they are often amusing!<br /><br />How her politics about immigration evolved after learning the language (she already knew English from living in Kenya), who she met both as a refugee & student in the land of Enlightenment; the work she took on: cleaning, typing, translating & living wherever she could find a place away from immigrant ghettos. She used the system already in existence modestly with the intent of spring boarding to a life she could support with her own earnings: exactly the opposite to the immigrants who live off such generous welfare payments that they have no need to seek work, while the women are still forbidden to venture out into the new land, may not learn the language nor attain citizenship.<br /><br />INFIDEL is a very well written keeper: flowing language, lucid descriptions, asking questions without giving away the answers. You should see all my \\"Ahha!\\" Moments I made in the margins ~ a no-brainer for Women's Book Clubs & a textbook for psychology students... WOW!truggle of dominance which he ends by beating the you-know-what out of his student, breaking her skull.

B004FOA84A|5.0|ABSOLUTLY AWESOME game!!!  We played it for three days and eventually had to look at the walkthrough video LOL.  We loved the game and would love to have a sequel to keep us busy.  We loved how each item found had to be used to gain another item.  Thank you so much for the fun and adventure.  PLEASE make a sequel!!!!
6304884419|1.0|I purchased 2 movies A Bronx Tale. 1 was not connected to the DVD case, it was just flopping around. I bought the movies for an x-mas gift and was sad when I had to give one that wasn't perfect. It was broken in the case. This made me sad and second guessing the purchase of anything else from the internet. I was not given instructions on how to return it so I'm stuck with it.<br />Sad but true. I gave it away so too late now.
B004ECDNJU|3.0|This game is a fun concept, but the harder levels revealed some glaring flaws in the program's logic. There are levels that cannot be completed within the time limit given the randomness of the orb and receiver colors. There are also levels with automatic switches that become impossible when you are down to the last two orbs. It is a good game that needs to be refined.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|For under $9 (okay, just a hair under) this is a nice TPU case for the iPhone.  It looks reasonably good though I could take or leave the ring pattern on the back of the case.<br /><br />It can survive bumps and drops reasonably well (which is why I put my phone in a case in the first place).<br /><br />I can't speak to the screen protector as I don't use them.  It looks like many others I've seen and I'm sure it's adequate.  I've never had a problem with the glass on an iPhone and don't like to add anything that can interfere with the beautiful display.<br /><br />I'm primarily using a 12South BookBook case for my iPhone now (check out my review on that product too - love it), but there have been a few times I needed my phone without the bulk of the 12South case and I immediately slipped it back into this case.  It's my backup go-to case without question.<br /><br />Amazon also really make the price right!  Bring on more Amazon Basics products, please!
0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones is testament to giving a book a second chance. Almost 15 years ago, I put the book down, disturbed by the whimsical flourish with which George R. R. Martin tortured, disgraced and offed his well-developed characters. I was sick of reading \\"political\\" fantasy, that seemed to spend more time in council rooms and with intrigue than it did bearing swords and fighting the good fight. Now, with gray hairs on my head and having gone through the intrigue and struggle of trying to raise a large family with honor, I must say that Mr. Martin's saga is a brilliant one.<br /><br />It is not very often that one reads a truly \\"inspired\\" work. Game of Thrones seems to shine in my mind, with all its wretched deceit and gritty realism, as a stand out work that goes beyond the pale of its genre, and touches on the travails of what it is to be human.<br /><br />Is there sex, murder, and magic, yes. But, one does not feel that any of this is done for its own sake, but Martin seems as an honest chronicler of the world that has passed before his inner-mind and has been lovingly transferred to ours.<br /><br />No character in this book is flawless, and even their virtues show themselves for what they are: a desperate grasp and sometimes an indulgence in an uncertain world.<br /><br />Are there some characters that stand out as my own personal favorites? I have to say that, as in Martin's work in television and in his other works (The Wild Card series), he holds the finest touches to character with those that are truly outcasts, alone with their state. It is here that the people seem to best know themselves, and it is their friends that reach out, and we feel that grasp, as if they have reached out to us, the readers. Most prominent in my mind are these three wonderful characters, Dani Teggarian, Jon Snow, and Terian Lannister (forgive my spelling, I listened to this first volume on audio).<br /><br />I look forward to the many hours of pleasure I will experience in the future returning to this world, where the touches of magic are so subtle, that they seem all the more magical. My hopes is that the gods of the first men (as whimsical and removed as they seem to be) grant us the bounty of seeing a completion to this saga.magic are so subtle, that they seem all the more magical.

B00284BMBM|5.0|I own all three of Daughtry's albums but I've only listened to this one all the way through so far. And after hearing this, I have high expectations for Break the Spell and I've heard most of the debut which is very good so far, as well. Daughtry is probably the best American Idol singer now because he is consistent on his songs as well as very passionate about what he's singing about. And his voice is far beyond most of the other singers of Idol.  Anyway: the music  Daughtry is very energetic and melodic in his music and also very emotional on his ballads. Very good sound.  1. You Don't Belong- A very strong opening to the album. Very nice guitar intro, an energetic, yet melodic chorus, and extreme catchiness make this a great song. One of the better songs on the album but not even close to the very best on here. Great song, though.  2. No Surprise- A very nice song and good choice as a single! I like the guitar part & the chorus is really nice. Daughtry can really show emotion in his slower songs and it's less evident here but still evident enough. Good song.  3. Everytime You Turn Around- A definite favorite here. I love the drum intro and I love the melodies that the song has. I also love the slight progression it has from being hard rock on the verses to having a soaring, melodic chorus. His voice is amazing here & I'm often singing along to the chorus of this one.  4. Life After You- A very meaningful ballad and another favorite. The chorus is especially powerful as is the music itself. A very excellent choice as a single!  5. What I Meant to Say- This song is also unique like \\"Everytime You Turn Around\\" because it has a heavier verse with a soaring chorus. I really like this one as well, but \\"Everytime...\\" is better in my honest opinion.  6. Open Up Your Eyes- Another nice ballad and this should've been a 4th single I think! Very nice song and very meaningful. Very peaceful, melodic, and beautiful. Daughtry can expect me to be buying lots of future albums.  7. September- Very deep song. I love the opening guitar, his voice tone in this song specifically, the lyrics within the chorus (and the rest of it, but mainly the chorus), and just the song. Best single the album produced in my opinion, and A song that I will remember for the rest of my life. This song holds a special place with all the 80's ballads I like. GREAT, GREAT SONG!!!  8. Ghost of Me- A nice rocker kinda reminiscent of \\"What I Meant to Say\\", but not as good. I like it, but It's not one of the best here. Still decent, though. Fun to rock out to!  9. Learn My Lesson- I like this song, but I know it isn't one of the best ballads here. It lacks the emotional power of \\"September\\" & \\"Life After You\\" but I like it because it's got a good set of lyrics in there but the music department isn't as good as it could be.  10. Supernatural- A good rocker in the style of \\"Ghost of Me\\" & \\"What I Meant to Say\\" and very cool. I like the beat and the melody of it. Good song.  11. Tennessee Line- An inspired song and a great one, I think. I like the backing vocalist, but Daughtry Shines here as always. Great emotional song and I love it!  12. Call Your Name- A little lacking compared to the rest of the album in my opinion. but never the less, still very decent and pretty good. But not as good.  Verdict: Very good album & I recommend it to anybody who likes The All American Rejects, Daughtry's debut album, Breaking Benjamin, Skillet, or any form of hard rock or melodic music. Great Album and I think it is definitely one of the top 5 best overall albums of 2009.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has been marketed for teens, but as an adult I loved it.  It was action packed, suspenseful, and distrubing in a real life hardship kind of way.  Probably one of the best post acopalytic story that I have encountered.  Very good twist in the plots as the story plays out.  Really looking forward to the movie.

0739366408|5.0|The book was quite literally the best (most entertaining, well detailed and thought out universe) zombie book I've ever read.  This audio book, while not complete in detail, is still quite compelling.  The chilling details are quite literally goose-bump raising when read by the mass of talent assembled.  I was initially worried that the shortened story wouldn't capture what made the book enjoyable.  I was so wrong!  The story told by the various voices span 5 discs but held my attention for every minute of it (to the neglect of more important tasks).  My recommendation: If you even remotely enjoyed the book or have any bit of a vague interest in war or zombies (or both), buy the book. Read it. Then buy this CD compilation and rearrange your schedule.  Enjoy!

Super clean sound compared with what I'm used to hearing with my domestic discs with the exception of Born to Run and Darkness since they've been nicely remastered via the recent box sets. Nebraska does NOT sound slowed to me, and clocks in at 40:47, same time as my previous import CD of that gem. Nice way to start 2012, on the Big Man's 70th birthday to boot. Just when I was tiring of the early stuff.....

0195145925|5.0|Its interesting to note just how diverse the reviews of 'The End of Time' are.   If you are looking for the book with all the answers - you'll be disappointed. If however you have a reasonable handle on Physics and have had a niggling doubt that something is wrong with the current consensus on Cosmology - then Barbour's insights will be fascinating. There are a number of important questions that Barbour doesn't touch upon - but 'The End of Time' creates a fascinating landscape to re-ask questions like - what are Black Holes in Julian's Platonia?  I'd suggest complementary books include Huw Price's \\"Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point: New Directions for the Physics of Time\\" - also suggest Stewart Kauffman - as an understanding of 'emergence' (especially of our experience of time) - is an important consequence of Barbour's theory.

B005DR64OQ|5.0|I have to admit that Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite, as is the beautiful and talented Nicole Kidman. Others review the story in detail, but your better off being surprised, Some interesting twists and the ending has almost as much action as a James Bond movie (well almost).  Nicolas Cage (Kyle Miller) is a diamond dealer who is so far in debt that those wanting their money back want his life. His wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) adds some suspense in the drama and his daughter Avery (Liana Liberato) is a stereo typical teenage self centered idiot striving to grow up and learns her lesson. The ending was bit of a surprise but great! This is a video for the whole family, and they will love it, I did and bought it!.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate and informative. love the forecast videos and the radar map. perfect for anyone who loves to check the weather.
B004WW88BK|3.0|I've got the old \\"Complete Collection\\" album and after reading reviews of \\"The Centennial Collection\\" I was expecting a lot less hiss in this version.<br /><br />I was gifted the MP3 version of this album for my Birthday (nice gift) and while it is nice, I have noticed that it has quite a lot of hiss that reminds me a lot of the old \\"Complete Collection\\" version.<br /><br />I've listened to the \\"Centennial Collection\\" on Rdio and found that the hiss is dramatically reduced in their version. It actually sounds really nice on Rdio but is very distracting in Amazon's version.<br /><br />This makes me wonder if Amazon's rip is just very poor or if they cheated customers by re-using the \\"Complete Collection\\" version and just tagging it to appear as if it is the \\"Centennial Collection\\".<br /><br />Check out the version on Rdio, it sounds worlds better than the Amazon.com MP3 version.<br /><br />Very odd.

B005PTQPU0|3.0|Well I guess anyone who buys a new Kate Bush album knows what they're getting. It's sure not as good as The Dreaming or Hounds of Love. Not very inventive when compared to those earlier albums. Just sort of plods along. For someone who takes so long between albums you'd think she'd come up with something really imaginative, but it's kind of dull. Not terrible, but nothing spectacular either. And I have to say the packaging is really dumb. Every time you take the disc out of the sleeve it will get scratched. What was wrong with jewel cases? At least they kept your CDs from getting scratched. Now everyone has to think up some unique new packaging that will scratch up your discs.

B0000073BG|5.0|NOTHING could have prepared me for the excellence found throughout Scheherazade & Other Stories.  Also, nothing could have prepared me for the difficulty in pronouncing the word \\"Scheherazade\\", haha!  Do I love this album from beginning to end?  Do I ever!  Looking for a weak point would take me an eternity to find, because if there is one, I honestly have trouble spotting it.    The thing that really escalates this album above the other ones, in my opinion at least, is the way Annie Haslam really feels like she's locked in this time around.  Her voice has always been fantastic, but something about her vocal melodies on this album just leaves me speechless.    \\"Trip To the Fair\\" is amazing on some indescribable level.  It sounds almost like a nursery rhyme in spots, thanks to the gentle way the piano sails along.  The classical-like complexity of the 3-minute intro makes it seem more sophisticated than it would initially seem.  From here... it just blows me away.  Annie's vocals come in, and this might be the catchiest vocal melody I've ever heard on a Renaissance album.  \\"A trip to the fair... but nobody was there!\\"  Annie sings this line in such a realistic way that it makes you feel abandoned almost, like you're really there.  I can just imagine taking a trip alone to a fair, arriving at night and... the only thing there is a locked gate, turned off lights and the sound of the wind blowing.  Just a phenomenal song.  \\"Vultures Fly High\\" would have made a wonderful pop single.  It contains another fantastic vocal melody, but with a fast pace (well, faster than most Renaissance songs).  It might not be the flashiest song on the album, but it proves Renaissance had something doing good here.  \\"Ocean Gypsy\\" has some rather poetic and inspiring lyrics, and quality vocals as well.  The piano solo in the middle is truly something else.  It almost reminds me of the Genesis classic \\"Firth of Fifth\\" but it's not quite the same.  Alright, these lyrics probably don't appeal to me a whole lot since it's basically romantic poetry (at least, it sure seems like it) but I don't care.  But then... then... THEN comes the 24-minute minutes of perfection to end this album.  Speaking of Genesis, I might even put this 24-minute track above \\"Supper's Ready\\" and that's not necessarily an easy task for me since \\"Supper's Ready\\" was always a high point for me (mainly because it was the first prog epic I've ever experienced, so the memories are precious and unforgettable) but *oh my freaking goodness* does \\"Song of Scheherazade\\" do everything right.  For 24 straight minutes, all the arrangements are put together in just the right way, Annie's voice builds and soars in all the appropriate places, and it's just a perfect song to me.  I can see myself listening to this song over and over on headphones all night long... because that's actually what I did last night!    If you even think for a moment you want to be a progressive rock fan, I HIGHLY recommend this album.  It's nothing short of brilliant.

B005DKLPF6|4.0|Good:<br /><br />- I Personally liked Black Tongue, The Hunter, SpectreLight, Curl of the Burl, Octopus Has no Friends and The Sparrow. Somehow i really liked the song that everybody hates (Creature Lives).<br /><br />- Really liked the sound of the music in this album.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />- Some songs are just similar or not very diferent from each other or feel like filler.<br /><br />- The songwriting sometimes feel lazy. One could think of these songs as leftovers from Blood Mountain or Crack the Sky.<br /><br />- Mastodon didnt tried too hard on this album. This is Their \\"Worst\\".<br /><br />This is not a bad purchase at all. The album is not perfect. Its only Good. I recommend any previous work from Mastodon better than this one.<br /><br />In conclusion, there's so much good discs out there realeased this year (Opeth, Machine Head, Anthrax, Megadeth, Dream Theater). Check them out and if you got time to check this album out, do it. You wont regret it.<br /><br />Obvious Note: English is not my first language. And i suck at it. Cheers!!!
0385340540|5.0|I have always been a big fan of John Grisham's books especially the audio books. I enjoyed the story and its pace. The Italian aspect of the story was marvelous. As fans of Mr. Grisham he keeps the story telling from becoming routine and stale. I enjoy the fact that he did incorporate a type of international and unpredictable story. The characters are complex and they given depth which is sadly lacking with today's authors. Thank you for being a suspensful storyteller.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works great - simple, smooth action, responsive.  I love it.  The only downside and a very minor one is the annoying ad at the end of each game but since it's a free app I'm not complaining.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, by retired science professor Richard Dawkins of Oxford University, is at once of `thriller' and 'sure-footed non-fiction' genres. Mind-bending to wondrously eye-opening, this work clarifies the mountainous evidence for Evolution. How nice the synchronicity: publishing it on the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th of The Origin of Species. Marketing has its place. I had mulled Darwin's statement: \\"There is grandeur in this view of life.\\" After reading TGSOE, it rang truer yet. And toward the last of its 437 pages, I was almost giddy (sounds isotopily unstable, I know)<br /><br />[Footnote: The Bible and Qur'an are not science books] Scientific findings should not be ignored, dismissed out of hand, or its data unanalyzed, because it belies dogma; often enough, human animals are seduced into delusional world views due to fear; perusing a few pages here n there just might start a process of freeing one up, however, from its limiting effects. When is it that one gets dissuaded from questioning? Or derided for critical thinking? Or if fortunate, encouraged to curiosity? Well, if YOU were dissuaded at some point, Dawkins' book may be your ticket to a life-renewing antidote. (Consider visiting a museum of natural history, too.) Now I doubt that the mere reading of this work will result in all the intellectual mutations Dawkins hoped for; certainly not among the devout, who faithfully remain cocooned in the beguiling comforts of  platitudes. But in time...<br /><br />Revelation: 1) modern species do not evolve into other modern species; they share common ancestors. 2) Animal and plant breeding--techniques applied for centuries--give us insight into branches of living diversity that spread over millions upon millions of years, via random, mutating genes within DNA. (Broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts have all  derived--via non-random/artificial selection by bright humans--from a common ancestor: wild cabbage) Pedigree dog-breeding led to today's 200+ breeds, each sharing a common ancestor: the wolf; molecular genetics proved it. Wolves adapted to man via natural selection, by self-domesticating into village dogs. 3) When we observe an increase or decrease in the frequency with which a certain gene appears in a gene pool, THAT is evolution. 4) Skilful breeding (artificial, or by insects, bats, hummingbirds, frogs) of roses or sunflowers, produced innumerable varieties. 5) Cross-fertilization via pollination led Darwin, who'd come upon an orchid with a foot-long tubular, to predict the existence of a very long-nosed Madagascar moth with an even longer tongue; just such a moth was found. 6) By sexual selection, Nature plays the role of a selecting agent, and living bodies are patchworks of compromise aimed at survival, but hardly perfectly. 7) Wild foxes have been bred for tameness, using variations in `flight distances' and cute facial expressions. 8) Orchids exist that fool male bees into pollinating them by looking like a female bee. 9) Measured age of Earth is 46 million centuries--4.6 billion years. Now let that sink in. Hmm?<br /><br />Measuring Time: re: Radioactive clocks--unstable isotopes decay, turning into something else at known rates; `half-life' is a favored measure: time for half an element's atoms to decay; Geological clocks--tree rings (date back 11,500 years), coral-reef rings, carbon dating, which began in the 1940s, was refined by mass spectrometry; an accumulating quantity of argon-40 in a rock crystal derives from decay in potassium-40, and these accumulations enable elapsed-time measurements. If an igneous rock shows a 50-50 ratio of argon to potassium, it is 1.26 million years old. Now at the moment an animal or plant dies it ceases to take in Carbon-14, and so begins to decay to Nitrogen-14; elapsed time can be measured as the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 in the deceased. Is chemistry hot or cool? Maybe both.<br /><br />Evolution in our time: a) elephants' tusks shortening within mere decades, as humans killed for ivory; these mammals suspected or knew the reason why, at some level; b) evolutionary divergence was also evidenced on islands off Croatia: in 1971, pairs of lizards were introduced to a non-lizard islet; then in 2008--some 19 lizard generations later--a thriving population of `new-home' lizards was found to have grown larger heads than the `old home' lizards. The evolutionary change? Traced to the vegetarian diet in their new islet setting. c) Guppies (aquarium fish) evolve with blend-in camouflage--depending on type/prevalence of predators--or by changing color-schemes where predators are scarcer, all in an effort by males to attract females by standing out. (Hey, tattoos may yet become inked into our DNA)<br /><br />A fundamental (ist) myth whacked: No modern species is descended from any other modern species; nope, humans are NOT descended from monkeys; but each species shares a common ancestor that dates back 6 million years. `Lucy' from Ethiopia/1974, aka Australopithecus afarensis, is a bipedal hominid fossil 3.2 million years old. Homo erectus fossils (Java Man), less than a million years old, were unearthed in 1891; in 1929 (Peking Man). Ardi, found in Ethiopia in 1992, are the fossilized skeletal remains of a female Ardipithecus ramidus, a human-like species 4.4 million years old. And the bits just keep on comin'<br /><br />\\"Natural selection favors the survival in the gene pool of the genetic mutations responsible for making crucial changes in embryos.\\" Dawkins devotes Ch 9 to how geographical barriers (islands or isolation) play key roles in evolution; barriers arise via quakes, tsunamis, climate change, volcanic eruptions, continental drift. In Ch 10, he shows us a fascinating display of similarities--invariance across all vertebrates--among mammalian skeletons, despite differences in skeletal size, shape, or purpose (viz., Pterodactyl vs. human). The photography and illustrations are first-rate.<br /><br />The molecular clock assumes that aspects of evolution itself proceed at fixed rates. The genome is subject to mutations; only in a tiny portion of it, however, is it that any mutation bears on survival; natural selection rids deleterious mutations, yet favors ones that enhance life by forging adaptations to changing environments. In evolutionary time, mutations may go `to fixation'--become part of a genetic norm. Evolutionary history is written all over us. In dolphins, too--for having migrated from land to sea they still have lungs, not gills; nature's record is dotted with major flaws being \\"corrected\\"--a genetic tinkering, if you will, at a local level that nature required for a species' survival.<br /><br />Given contemporary human health woes, the Devil's chaplain could gleefully write a helluva book recounting them all, but Dawkins emphasizes that nature is neither kind nor unkind; neither favoring nor opposing suffering.

I bought black, and on the first day, I had to take a lint brush and remove particles. On the flip side, the softness of that material really protects the screen. It is not like the iPad 2 cover in that it is a little more durable.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Game is OK - not as much fun as I would have liked. I prefer something that takes more thinking and is a mind challenge rather than a finger challenge.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|This is quite simply the worst movie that I can at least remember watching.  I've sat through some boring ones which have all had for the most part either some interesting, personal or humorous points to them and I can safely say in my opinion this had none of those.  I'm no movie critic at all, don't get me wrong.  I'm not going to get in depth about how directors should or shouldn't have done their jobs better or this and that differently, I just know this was a bad movie and I'm leaving it pretty much at that.  I actually think this is my first movie review on amazon.  What I can say is there was no \\"personal\\" factor in this movie at all.  They did a poor job making the characters likable, and through the entire movie it was hard to feel sorry for anyone because of that.  I still can't figure out who the lead role was, it seemed for the most part to be equally spread out between the two \\"main\\" characters.  I am a huge sci fi fan when it comes to extra terrestrials, I am also a big universe and the cosmos lover as well.  I put 2 and 2 together thinking I'd like this and boy was I ever wrong.  It was like Alien meets arachnaphobia meets Blair witch project.  My wife and I literally were  offended when it was over that we wasted time that could have been well invested elsewhere on this one.  I don't recommend it at all.  Unless you borrowed it for free, but you'd still feel ripped off.  A prime example why I wait until movies are affordable enough from a rental standpoint and don't waste the 30.00 driving to the movies.  The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because I feel like 1 star is the equivalent to saying I hate you to someone.  That's just downright mean.  2 stars for the fact that someone can make a movie.  I know I can't.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I have seen this movie 3 times now, -yes it's that good! (And I'm getting it the day it comes out.)<br /><br />This movie you could say is mainly for guys. Which is kinda true, but it is a really good movie for girls to see! It shows girls what to look for in men. And it shows guys how to be men!<br /><br />The movie covers topics about: drugs, death, fear, etc. To me, there is nothing gory. It does show a gang affiliation scene. (This scene does show around 10 men punching and kicking a boy when joining the gang) -The movie would be rather intense for some people, but you need intesity to make it realistic.<br /><br />There are some VERY funny parts! (As in on the ground crying because you are laughing so hard) and there are other parts you may want a box of tissues... (Just had to say, I managed not to cry once! ;)<br /><br />Some LEO's reading this review may be wondering \\"is it realistic LEO life, or not to much?\\" -I'd give it a 95% for the reality of Law-enforcement. There is a search warrant in the begining that if you watch, I don't need to tell you the numerous flaws they had... It wasn't to bad, but enough for some Cops to really notice. (I noticed a few things right away) They most definatly nailed the LEO family and humor, and the intensity of the job is there. -There is one call towards the end that involves a shoot-out, among some other things, and this scene was enough to make your heart rate go up, they did very well with being realistic on that call.<br /><br />-Overall, it was a GREAT movie! If anyone still has questions, comment and I'll do my best to answer them! :)

076790592X|5.0|After reading Tuesdays with Morrie my life was changed. I learned many lessons on life, death, and everything between. After reading the book, everyday now I think back to what Morrie talked about. This is a book that when you get done reading it you will think to yourself that everyone should read this nook sometime in their life. I enjoyed this book greatly and I would recommend it to anyone to read.
B001JJX7L0|5.0|There is always a question about composers of the great pianoforte music as Chopin, Liszt, Beethoven, those whose playing was not there when the sound recording was - how would he play his own music?  How did Beethoven play \\"Waldstein\\" himself?  And how did Chopin played his own mazurkas or ballades?  Or at least, how would he wish it to be played?<br /><br />Listening to this recording, one comes to a conclusion that it simply does not get any better; or that this is probably how CHopin envisioned, or heard his music playing in his mind.  The indescribable elegance of Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, coupled with such a sprezzatura technique that consequently you don't even notice it, you hear only the music, makes his playing miracle.  Another miracle is that he passed his art on another great pianist, Maurizio Pollini, who was his pupil, and at this point I think this Italian school is superior to my long-time worshiped titan Vladimir Horowitz.  While Horowitz is technically unsurpassed - yet Pollini is no less - the poetry of Michelangeli is far beyond, which he narrates in the Ballade in G minor, Op. 23.  One can easily compare the two interpretations:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0013AYXNQ Horowitz Plays Chopin: Vol. 1]]<br /><br />The mazurkas by Michelangeli simply evoke the atmosphere of an aristocratic salon, perhaps that of Georges Sand where some of them were surely played - by the maestro and maybe occasionally by Franz Liszt? When one tries to invoke that refined yet quite libertine and appropriately romantic environment, the loves Georges Sand and Chopin, of Countess d'Agoult and Liszt, elegant and well-supplied by the ladies' riches, a truly unique pictures emerges; and that special mood of making one's life as a work of art pours from Michelangeli's interpretation of Chopin's music.  When in Berlin, it is interesting to contemplate on the subject in front of this picture in Alte Nationalgalerie - \\"Liszt at the Piano, 1840, Josef Danhauser\\" and it is easy to see Chopin in Liszt's place there, in such a quintessentially romantic pose, with his fair lady at his feet, looking up at the performing Orpheo in a state of awe, while other worshippers seem to freeze in adulation - they look like Schubert or Chateaubriand but in fact are Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo; the bust of Beethoven seems to smile from what he hears, and Lord Byron nods approvingly from his portrait...<br /><br />My favorite mazurka on this recording is Op.68 No.2 - Lento, for a simple reason that although it is so deceptively simple, written in C major, I can never play it correctly, and for a long time Michelangeli playing of this piece simply mesmerizes me.<br /><br />Yet it is unquestionably the ballade that is the most challenging, for both interpretive and technical reason.  I have heard a few interpretations of this op. 23, including live performances, but this one is above and beyond all of them, including Horowitz, as I mentioned.  How many more superlatives it is possible to give?  I want to celebrate this recording by concluding with the history of this ballade which is as fascinating as the musical piece itself; my foreword would be - is it not another pleasant fact regarding Chopin's genius that he did not seem to share the Gothic Teutonic taste for ballades, and his ballades always sound luminous and optimistic, even if they are full of mysterious whispers?<br /><br />Here is the story:<br /><br />A \\"ballad,\\" according to the Random House Dictionary, is \\"a simple, narrative poem of popular origin, composed in short stanzas, especially one of romantic character and adapted for singing.\\" The term was derived from an ancient musico-poetic form that accompanied dancing (\\"ballare\\" in medieval Latin, hence \\"ball\\" and \\"ballet\\"), which had evolved into an independent vocal genre by the 14th century in the exquisitely refined works of Guillaume de Machant and other early composers of secular music. The ballad was well established in England as a mediumfor the recitation of romantic or fantastic stories by at least the year 1500; it is mentioned by Pepys, Milton, Addison, and Swift, often disdainfully because of the frequently scurrilous nature of its content. The form, having adopted a more elegant demeanor, became popular in Germany during the late 18th century when it attracted no less a literary luminary than Goethe, whose tragic narrative Erlk&ouml;nig furnished the text for one of Schubert's most beloved songs.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006W2H6IY Schubert Lieder Erlkonig Premium Poster Print, 24x32]]<br /><br />Chopin seems to have been the first composer to apply the title to a piece of abstract instrumental music, apparently indicating that his four Ballades hint at a dramatic flow of emotions such as could not be appropriately contained by traditional Classical forms. (Such transferral of terms between artistic disciplines was hardly unknown during the Romantic era. Liszt, the first musical artist in history with enough nerve to keep an entire public program to himself, dubbed his solo concerts \\"musical soliloquies\\" at first, and later gave them the now-familiar designation, \\"recitals.\\" --\\"How can one recite at the piano?\\" fumed one British critic. \\"Preposterous!\\"). Brahms, Liszt, Faur&eacute;, Grieg, Vieuxtemps, and Frank Martin all later provided instrumental works with the title Ballade.<br /><br />In the Ballades, \\"Chopin reaches his full stature as the unapproachable genius of the pianoforte,\\" according to Arthur Hedley, \\"a master of rich and subtle harmony and, above all, a poet--one of those whose vision transcends the confines of nation and epoch, and whose mission it is to share with the world some of the beauty that is revealed to them alone.\\" Though the Ballades came to form a nicely cohesive set unified by their temporal scale, structural fluidity, and supranational idiom, Chopin composed them over a period of more than a decade. He once suggested to Robert Schumann that he was \\"incited to the creation of the Ballades\\" by some poems of his Polish compatriot Adam Mickiewicz (1798--1855), whom he met and played for in Paris around 1835. The English composer and author Alan Rawsthorne noted, however, that \\"to pin down these Ballades to definite stories is gratuitous and misleading, fur in suggesting extra-musical connotations the attention is distracted from the purely musical scheme which is ... compelling in itself and completely satisfying?' Rather than obscuring the essential nature of these pieces, the apparently opposing views of Schumann and Rawsthorne lead directly to the very heart of Chopin's achievement: the near-perfect melding of Romantic fantasy and feeling with an Apollonian control of form and figuration. By no other composer in the history of the art has the delicate balance between emotion and intellect been so finely achieved as by Chopin -- heart and head are weighed perfectly in his, the most precisely calibrated of all musical scales.<br /><br />The first ideas for Ballade No. 1 in C minor, Opus 23 were sketched in May and June 1831, when Chopin was living anxiously in Vienna, almost unknown as a composer and only slightly appreciated as a pianist. By the time that the work was completed four years later, however, he had achieved such fame and fortune in Paris that he could dedicate the piece to Baron de Stockhausen, the Hanoverian ambassador to France, whom he counted among his noble pupils. Breitkopf und Hartel published the work in Leipzig in June 1836. (Chalgrin's Arc de Triomphe and Meyerheer's Les Huguenots were also completed during that year).<br /><br />Schumann called this Ballade \\"the most spirited and daring work of Chopin,\\" and reported that it was inspired by Mickiewicz's Kon rad Velenrod, a poetic epic concerning the battles between the pagan Lithuanians and the Christian Knights of the Teutonic Order. The work exhibits both the ingenious conflation of sectional, sonata, and rondo forms and the voluptuous, wide-ranging harmonic palette that mark all of the Ballades.<br /><br />This recording is a masterpiece.ayed for in Paris around 1835.

B006INDMEE|4.0|I rented this last weekend and watched it once by myself and then again with DH. The acting was superb, especially Helen Mirren as the aging Rachel Singer, Jessica Chastain as her younger self, and&mdash;in a complex and brilliantly nuanced performance&mdash;Jesper Christensen as Dieter Vogel, \\"The Suregon of Birkenau.\\" But I have to knock off a star for the weird casting.<br /><br />Martin Csokas and Tom Wilkinson are well enough matched in their respective roles as the young and older Stefan Gold, but I was so confused by the casting for the roles of David Peretz (Sam Worthington/Ciaran Hinds) that it took a while before I could follow what was going on. By the end of the movie, the relationships were more clear, but the stark difference in appearance between the two actors set off a cognitive struggle that caused me to miss a lot of other important details and nuances in my effort to keep straight just who was who. I think this one casting mistake is a major flaw of the movie, although the actors themselves did their best with what they were given.<br /><br />The casting problem aside, I really did like this movie, and more so the second time through it. You could have heard a pin drop when DH and I were watching it, so gripping was this tragedy of errors. But it's subtle in its pacing and effects, with the tension building internally and not as a result of lots of blow-em-up, bash-em-up, fire-em-up scenes. Someone wanting an Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone action flick will most certainly be disappointed; but those seeking a sophisticated thriller that will keep them wondering long after the ending credits role will I think be captivated by it. If my rental had not already expired, I'd watch it yet again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so fun! I play this game for hours and never get tired of it! I recommend this to everyone!
B006O5XYWG|2.0|I have to say at the outset that I prefer my \\"Apes\\" movies to be more thought-provoking than action-packed. I settled in to watching this one fully expecting it was going to be a really good movie, it started out so well. However, after inhaling the chemical that was supposed to make the apes wake up to being more intelligent and humanlike, the \\"jailbreak\\" deteriorated into rampaging apes just beating the bloody you-know-what out of every human in sight. It ended with such hackneyed violence, it put me to sleep. If you like that kind of thing, you might like this movie. I don't and did not.

0312641893|4.0|Familiar with the Cinderella story? How about Cinderella + androids + cyborgs + a deadly plague + moon people?<br /><br />The world has been ravished by war and plague so that there are only a few ruling powers left and they have changed from our time. Plus, there are people known as Lunars who live on the moon and have evolved in such a way that they can use the bioelectricity around them; in effect, \\"magically\\" manipulating those around them.<br /><br />But what about our Cinderella character? Linh Cinder is a cyborg (though few know it) and the only full-service mechanic (and a gifted one at that) at New Beijing's weekly market. Of course, her talent and personality matter nothing to those who consider cyborgs to be second-class citizens. Her stepmother, Adri, looks down on her as well as one of her stepsisters, Pearl. But Cinder can count on two friends: Peony, her younger stepsister and Iko, her android with a personality all her own.<br /><br />Life becomes interesting when Prince Kaito disguises himself to go to market and seek out Linh Cinder, the best mechanic in the Eastern Commonwealth. Cinder is surprised to encounter the prince and to learn that he is kind and cheerful with a sense of humor. He leaves his broken android with her, making light of it even though it is important that he retrieve information from it.<br /><br />Then Peony, the good stepsister, falls ill with letumosis, the plague. Cinder's world falls apart after that.<br /><br />Google \\"The Musings of ALMYBNENR\\" to see this review in full in its original format and to follow my book review blog.
1847879071|5.0|This book appears to be an excellent statistics book, probably my best.  The SPSS techniques are right in line with what you're learning so as you learn the fundamental techniques, you're learning how to use them in one of the three major statistics software packages.  I actually dropped the stats course which required this text in favor of a mathematical statistics course, but I'm keeping the book because it's better than the other two I owned.  I think I'll also use it as a primer for SPSS as I've spent the majority of my time in SAS.  I must say, reading through the table of contents is EXCITING.  It also seems that the book is written with a more \\"conversational\\" voice than most other stats books, which likely reduces the fatigue that accompanies reading dry material, no matter how useful the content.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I went to alot of stores looking at cheap cases that were $30 for the \\"kindle fire\\" I came on Amazon and found this case, watched the video, and knew instantly it was better than what I had seen available in stores. I recieved the case and it's just as cool and slick as I knew it would be. My only complaint would be the shipping.. Slow (10-12 days) but it still showed up on the day they said it would be delivered. Faster shipping would be nice but no stars will be taken away by me as I said it arrived on the day it said it would. I'm 100% happy with this product and I can say it was worth waiting the 10 to 12 days (Slow shipping) Seeing I paid $30 for it and it blows all the ones I've seen in stores priced the same out of the water.
B005R4KUZE|5.0|I liked the free version so much, I bought this paid version.  I still hate the eyeball icon: I think it is an eyesore.  I also wish some of the smallest letters/fonts used are bigger (I'm running it on the Kindle Fire).

B0012EJW8E|1.0|Jim Morrison must be rolling over in his grave.  They have redone the whole album and it sucks.  It does not have the gritty bite of the original.  All of the Doors remixed, remastered and re-engineered albums have been corrupted and someone or someones had their heads up their collective ass and destroyed some great songs.  If it ain't broke don't fix it!
B004QDCZ3M|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present. I love this artist. The delux version is definitely worth the extra money.

B0068FYZIO|5.0|Easily one of the greatest, most inspiring films of all time, and yes, I, too, have no connection to the Holocaust, except that my pop fought the Nazis and was proud to help end that nightmare.  I would commend all who watch this film to also read Hannah Arendt's \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, am I missing something?  How could this film NOT be released in blu-ray, which is an appreciable step up from DVD?  I'm not buying it until then (I pay a couple dollars extra each month to get the blu-ray version of movies from Netflix -- definitely worth it if you have a good blu-ray player and surround-sound system).

B001OBT3FM|5.0|If you like either the performers or works performed or both you will find this dvd satisfying. The concerto performed by Mutter is in a broad and introspective manner fitting a tribute to a fellow musician who was a major influence on her career. The same can be said of the Tchaikovsky and Ozawa's conducting the Berliner's who make the most of both works. Mutter's poignant encore of the \\"sarabande\\" from Bach's Partita for solo violin No.2 in D minor (one can discern Mutter holding in the tears)which she played for Karajan in her audition for him is a fitting exclamation point to a wonderful concert. The bonus interviews of Mutter and Ozawa are a plus, just wish they were longer.  Purchase and enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game app is adicting and fun. great for the add kid in al of us. and it is free cant beat free right
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Love this show and love having the DVD's to watch anytime I wish. I am looking forward to purchasing seasons 7, 8 and 9 (when available) to complete my collection. We purchased seasons 1-6 for Christmas :-)
B005OCFGTO|1.0|This is a great price for a nice, bare bones collection of movies, which is perfectly fine by me. What is not fine by me is the fact that some of these movies were wide screen and some were full screen. A few had auto-play while others had previews. I don't mind if they're simply reprints of the original releases, but they could have at least been consistent with the products they reprinted. I am the kind of person who has to have wide screen, and wants things within a set to have the same basic functions (especially when advertised as such); please bear this in mind as you take in this information.   Also, the set that I received had five damaged discs; no physical damage or dust on the discs themselves, but they would not play past ten minutes into the movie, and some could not access secondary menus. This grievance is specific to the set I received, but buyer beware.   I will be returning this item and waiting for the next (likely more expensive, sadly) release of a Harry Potter boxed set.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I purchased this game for free on my Kindle Fire. I played it on my Nintendo DS and loved it then. It is even better on my Fire. highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app I have used it extensively for over a year. I love that I can easily view other versions while I'm studying. I take it to church first on my blackberry and I just got.a Kindle Fire for Christmas and it's even better. GREAT APP!!!!
B0053F042G|3.0|I would have given this four stars if not for the ending.  The movie was suspenseful and I was entertained, but it just seemed like the end didn't fit with the rest of the movie.  I rented it because I remember being intrigued by the trailer when it was released in theaters.  Overall, I am not disappointed that I watched it, but as the end approached, I kept thinking \\"there has to be a twist, this has to pick up pace again\\"!  Didn't happen.
0739384171|4.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire is the second book in a fast paced and interesting series. A tale of crime in high places, coverups,and an unlikely network of unique characters.  Murder, mayhem, and violence are focal points. At times, the many subplots and number of characters makes it somewhat difficult to follow. Despite the many unanswered questions - like the twin sister, the real relationship between the two main characters (Blomkvist and Salander), the unidentified  biological parents of Salander's brother, etc. it was still a tantalizing story, well written with complex characters. Suggest readers start with the first book in the series to have a better understanding of the interplay of characters and a smoother read if you are unfamiliar with Sweeden.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its a good Bible app lacking the maps and other stuff at the end of the Bible. It fits your need to get the word in use.
0740748475|5.0|Was just handed this 30 minutes ago and it is AWESOME!!! If you loved this strip as a kid don't hesitate to get it, it's worth it! The binding does seem kind of fragile --as other reviewers have noted-- but, at least in my case, I still have all my old books so I'll probably go over those on a more regular basis and just flip through this collection every once and again with great care. Once I have kids, they will not be allowed anywhere near this collection, hahaha.
1612130283|5.0|I love this story, it is amazing and not one that i want to put own or see an end to. I am certain this is a story that I will read over and over. The characters are engaging and the plot captivating. I recomend this book to everyone.
B0042FZWC0|2.0|I couldn't read the whole book. This reads like it was written by a post grad in the mid 90s when people used to sit around telling travel stories (at least in Australia). Now it is just assumed people have travelled and have moved on as their responsibilities increased. It is almost rude to tell the stories now as it makes you look as though you think you're special. Travel is old news.<br /><br />And what was with the plug to get on Oprah? Man have some pride. And for what?<br /><br />Chris sounds like an interesting and smart fellow. But this book really had nothing for me. I may have enjoyed it if I were 23 and the year was 1995 but I was looking for something more.

I really didn't pay much attention to what the book was about, just that it was a new Stephen King book. I am not a big history person and this book was defiantely a lot about history. I still absolutely loved it! Sadie was my favorite character and I loved the ending!!! I couldn't put it down and was very sad when it ended. I guess you can say that is the makings of a great book when your sad its over! :)

B004L49K2A|4.0|Well, firstly let me say I never thought I'd be writing this.  I'm an early fan of Rio and a late fan of the debut album, hated the Ragged 7 for leaving me high up on a precipice with nowhere to go. I'm infected with the post punk scene and love the new romantics '80/'81 - geesh, you'd think I'd go and get a life, but then, this is life.  Classic albums are classic albums and for me the 1st and Rio are classic albums and always will be.  I like Notorious, the singles from the Wedding album and Arcadia.  Can't stand Power Station or hip hop and to be honest I still believe theres something in Euro water that is rare in the states - but I think the internet is changing that for us.  When I first approached this album I had read some reviews and thought, oh yeah, here we go another old worn out, tired buncha guys making a comeback album...but then OMD did a really good job last year.....hmmmm, maybe....  Been playing it regularly over the past week or so and I have to say that beyond the cool looking cover and song titles that scream 'we wanna make a comeback'....there are actually really good songs in here - several of them  in fact.  Most noteably, 'Blame' 'Leopard' and 'Girl Panic' among others.  Their first and second get five stars therefore this one gets a four and it slides in and parks it's arse in between Rio and So Red the Rose...never thought I'd see that.    Can they do it again?  How did leBon keep his voice?
B0054JZC6E|2.0|the speed of the controls while playing are very poor, giving you a bad score making me very frusterated and ending up rage quitting.

B0017IYWEE|5.0|Thank you Diana for showing that there is more to Die Zauberflote than the 2 blockbuster Queen of the Night arias. Her renditions \\"Ach, Ich Fuhls\\" captures Pamina's anguish at thinking that Tamino does not love her anymore. It's hard for anything to really overshadow the Queen of the Night, but this is one of those moments that will have you emotional. Brava La Damrau.

B004O86JZ4|5.0|This review is based on just the vinyl of Wasting Light, not the music itself. Everybody already knows that it's a great album, probably the best of 2011 so I'm only talking about the vinyl itself here.<br /><br />This thing sounds amazing. There has been a trend lately of bands not doing too hot of a job transferring their music onto vinyl but this is not the case here at all. I don't know if it's because the band recorded the album through an analog source and if they just took the extra time to make sure the vinyl sounds great (I'm guessing both). The sound is so much tighter and crisp than the CD. This is what all new vinyls should sound like. Krist Novoselic's bass sounds amazing on \\"I Should Have Known\\", that just blew me away.<br /><br />It's a 2 LP set so you'll be flipping records every couple songs, and even though it's a 12'' the speed setting is 45 RPM's. I knew that going into it but I still forget to switch my turntable from 33 so it sounded really slooooow. I haven't listened to another record since I got this one a couple days ago but I know I'm going to end up forgetting to switch it back to 33 when I'm done with it.<br /><br />The packing is great. Each record is in it's own record white sleeve but then there is also different sleeves that include Foo Fighters artwork on them as well, but the records don't come shipped in those sleeves, which is how it should be. There is also a paper to download a free copy of the album in 320k mp3 format which is actually ripped from the vinyl which is pretty cool.<br /><br />The band did a great job with this release. A really great vinyl and the tunes are top notch. Well worth the $20.
B001IF252M|4.0|This product is wonderful and I use it often for my presentations. I have a Macbook Air, therefore I use this cord to hook up to projectors, etc. I suggest buying it from apple directly, or through amazon, but still from apple. I bought it from a different vendor and ended up sending the first product back because it was chipped and open. The second time I bought it from Apple and they did great. The product was actually new, packaged, and sealed. I trust apple and their wonderful products. you should too.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is such an addictive show! It's suspenseful and full of drama and lots of scandal..It comes on regular cable which of course has commercials inbetween so I can't wait to puchase this which will be commercial free! If you haven't seen this show before it's defiantly worth seeing!

1451627289|5.0|Classic Stephen King--many stories within the story.  When i saw 800 pages, i really contemplated if i wanted to devote that much of my life to one book. Driving home from the bookstore, my husband was trying to have a conversation, but i was so engrossed in the story already that I didn't hear a word!  Now that's a good book!  Sure there is some violence and the 'f bomb' is dropped repeatedly--which i can really do without, thank you very much--but i just ignore that and keep focused on content. The content is there and it holds your attention.  Would you change the past if you could?  Read on and you may be surprised with the answer.  Loved it and recommending it to all  my friends.

0786891416|5.0|First of all, I admit to being the biggest fan of the TV show \\"Castle\\". And I had hoped that the Nikki Heat novels were just as much fun - and they are! Just finished \\"Heat Wave\\", and what a great read. I loved comparing all the characters in the book to the ones they were based on from \\"Castle\\" - I had a great visual image of all the characters. The story and murder investigation held my interest all the way through. Plus, (spoiler alert) in \\"Heat Wave\\", Nikki Heat (a.k.a Detective Beckett in \\"Castle\\") and Jamison Rook (Richard Castle) 'hook up' and have a relationship, of sorts, of their own. A \\"Castle\\" fan's dream come true!  If you have not watched \\"Castle\\", and enjoyed this book, please do find Season 1 and try it out. If you are a \\"Castle\\" fan, then you'll likely enjoy this new literary series as well.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|For some reason, my tablet believes it's a phone. Hence, when I tried to install SwiftKey X Tablet, it told me I could not use it and directed me to this one instead. Which is fine, as it turns out; this one looks just fine on my 7\\" tablet.  Another weird quirk of my tablet: For some reason, it doesn't seem to have Predictive Text enabled. It doesn't matter what I install or what settings I change... The native keyboard just refuses to predict my text. It vexed me for awhile, then I decided to just try a different keyboard altogether.  Unfortunately, I had the same problem with EVERY keyboard I downloaded - aside from this one right here. SwiftKey X allows me to use Predictive Text AND Auto Correct. Plus, it looks nice and allows me to use a swipe to delete an entire word.  So while I usually opt to use free apps when available, I've gone for broke and bought this one.  I only hope they'll come out with a few more colors than blue and orange for the \\"Neon\\" theme.

145162445X|2.0|However correct the cosmological quantum or particle physics being developed these days might be this author has no right to redefine a commonly understood word to serve his purpose of sensationalizing his book as he so presumptuously does in its title \\"Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing\\". One can write a lot of remarkable sounding stuff if one is allowed to redefine simple concepts.   Nothing is just the contraction of the idea \\"no thing\\".  It's not the \\"absence of something\\" as he writes but the absence of all things. It is not a theological concept (he likes to write stuff like \\"theologians idealized nothing\\" since he knows that the term \\"theologian\\" already tends to discredit) or  some metaphysical subtlety like \\"substance\\", or \\"transubstantiation\\", and not \\"empty space\\", and nothing like the more complex if vague notion of intelligent design - Krauss likes to mix in a lot of stuff for confusion - but the simple abstract concept all humans have naturally. The author's redefined \\"nothing\\" is a kind of zero information soup of particles coming in and out of existence, which he should honestly create his own term for, an not usurp a well understood term to sound more sensational.   He writes in his remarkably sophomoric preface stuff like 'For surely \\"nothing\\" is every bit as physical as \\"something\\", especially if it is to be defined as the \\"absence of something\\" '.  I suspect this is a sign of mental disease.   Actually, he  admits the simple concept of nothing when he writes \\"So be it\\" (pg. xiv) . He  may be just dishonestly over-hyping and not insane, but I'm not sure.  He enjoys dismissing the First Cause argument as begging the question and delights in referring to the \\"turtles all the way down\\" counter point. Of course the First Cause has been asserted to contain, as it must, its own necessity for existence - something nothing else in the universe clearly has. And yes since we cannot even imagine how a being can contain its own necessity to exist, this First Cause is not a scientific concept or hypothesis.  I'm not a religious person so I'm fine with a person's desire to reflect only on scientific concepts, but such a person doesn't really have a way I see given in this book to know why the laws of physics are what they are. What such people like the author seems to me to be doing is first ASSUMING there is no First Cause creator, and then pushing that, with some quantum science plus speculations, to conclusions like \\"Perhaps the laws arouse themselves spontaneously\\". But this is really a sort of theology itself.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|This movie was about what I expected. It had a few hilarious moments. Anna Faris is always adorable and funny. Faris stars as Ally Darling. A few days before her sister's wedding, she looks back at all the guys she's dated (slept with) to see if he was the one. Chris Evans plays Colin, who helps her track down all 20 of her ex-boyfriends while slowly falling in love with her. I'd recommend WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?!!!

038533348X|5.0|Cat's cradle has the unique prose of Vonnegut. I´m talking about the perfect blend of humor, irony and truth that can summarize the most trascendental aspects of our existence. In this book - which to some people is the best of Vonnegut's novels-  religion, science and politics converge in the stories of an imaginary inventor of the atomic bomb, a sustance capable of freezing the planet, a prophet, a banana republic  and many other characters that reflect the contradictions of modern society. With memorable passages and new words of the \\"bookonist\\" faith, this book will undoubtedly leave a footprint in every reader.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|You can see from the bar graph showing the star ratings of the reviews here that this film elicits strong feelings, both positive and negative.  Although the film's overall rating is 3 stars as of this writing (January 2012), the 3-star rating itself has the smallest number of reviews, with the 5-star and 1-star reviews about equally divided, as are the 4-star and 2-star reviews.  It's not that most people found the film to be average, when in fact very few people did.  They either loved it or hated it.    It's unusual for a film to elicit such a polarized response, but it's not surprising that this film would.  Most people seem to agree that the film is filled with beautiful images (and they are stunning), but many people understandably expect more from a movie than gorgeous cinematography.  It appears to me that there are three main sections to the film:  a fairly long introduction, very visual and with only short sequences involving the characters, minimal dialogue and some brief and somewhat enigmatic voice-overs;  a longer middle section, in which the actors are seen in a series of separate but related episodes arranged in more or less chronological order;  and a conclusion, which returns to the highly visual style of the introduction, with the addition of more scenes including the characters, but again, very little dialogue, just voice-overs.    There is a story, but it's not shown in a tightly connected, linear manner.  The director assumes that viewers will fill in the blanks between the scenes, and he provides enough of a structure that this is not something that requires a great deal of speculation by the viewer.  Still, I think this section is the one that viewers may find most challenging (or annoying, depending on one's frame of mind), and I can see that it's not something that would appeal to everyone.  The first time I watched the film, I stopped after about 15 minutes, because I was tired, I had trouble paying attention, and I really wasn't sure it was going to be worth my time or my effort.  I'm very glad that I didn't give up on it, because the second time I watched it, I couldn't stop watching.    The acting is consistently excellent, and I found myself forgetting that it was Brad Pitt, because his portrayal of a 1950's father was so convincing.  The same was true of the mother and the actors who played the children.  It felt at times as if I were viewing a very beautifully presented documentary with high production values.    The soundtrack is a major part of the film, with passages from Mahler, Brahms, and others, and with such a soundtrack, and so many beautiful visual sequences, it's easy to see why this film had been compared to \\"2001.\\"  This is not a science fiction film, and it does not deal with space travel, but both films share a similar style.    The director took on a major project here, he did not flinch from challenging viewers, and ultimately, I believe that he was successful. It's a film I will definitely watch more than one time.   The Blu-Ray disc is outstanding, with excellent image quality and audio.  My only complaint is that there is only one 30-minute feature, and I think that a film like this would have an ideal candidate for a more comprehensive set of extra features.
145162445X|4.0|I should preface this by saying I am a fan of Dr. Krauss', and of the talk he gave by the same title, A Universe from Nothing. I very much appreciate the physics details Dr. Krauss explains, as well as short but pertinent historical context. I was hoping the book would also provide his wonderful sense of humor, occasional barbs at certain religious types, and pokes at ignorance. He did not disappoint. As I read, I can well imagine him being right there.<br /><br />This book provides a wonderful romp through the universe from the viewpoint of the problems scientists were trying to solve, all the way back to the Big Bang. What I appreciate about Dr. Krauss, and some of his colleagues, is the delightful analogies, diagrams that help visualize, as well as precise language. It's important for us to know when Dr. Krauss is speaking of knowledge where there is an abundance of evidence, versus speculation based on other evidence, or areas we just don't yet know but are exploring. Dr. Krauss takes care to detail with precise wording so I know exactly where we currently stand on concepts.<br /><br />As an Atheist, I don't need convincing that a creator is not needed. However, Krauss shows us well why a creator is not needed, and I appreciate his courage and candor in coming right out and saying it. I wish more scientists were as gusty and forthright. I'm so tired of *belief* being the acceptable default while critical thinking and expectation of evidence is frowned upon.<br /><br />But make no mistake, this is not a god or religion bashing book. It's a awesome read on the physics of our universe, with well-deserved asides sprinkled throughout. I'm almost done with the book, and will pull it off the shelf in the future to refresh my memory, to pull great quotes, and to savor where we are in the universe right now.

B00667KMUO|5.0|Excellent production and story line. Really neat ending to a violent (not a children series). The evolution of the character was masterful.  Being able to have the same three actors through out all the films really lent to authenticity of them in conclusion.
B006QPVH6O|4.0|Don't really understand why people are so disappointed? Yes the movie didn't have a huge alien that came out of nowhere jumped in the middle of the camera and said boo here I'am for the people that need to see the alien have 45 mins of screen time. But I will add if you compare it to the blair witch a lot more is shown, and explained. They make it easy to connect with the characters, and you feel something for them when one of them dies. So for that its a good movie. Maybe not as terrifing as some hoped for but it just looks great for the micro budget they shot with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I will give this a 5 star all day long, the only thing I wish they would do is create version for the kindle.  If they have one let me know, I don't see it on their site.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my fiancee expecting to love it despite previous reviews - because we don't really care about the pretty box set or bonus features or anything like that - We've had one out of eight discs play from start to finish without problems. This might be a rare issue but these discs cause my - fairly new - Samsung bluray player to go into \\"grind\\" mode - it's constantly trying to find where to even start reading the disc on 7 of 8. It stutters and skips partway through those seven movies as well. This doesn't happen with any other bluray we have - just the 7 of 8 discs in this box that are obviously burned incorrectly.  I've asked for a replacement set from Amazon for a Christmas gift that was supposed to work right the first time through- will update this review when possible. For now, I couldn't possibly give this set a lower rating.  UPDATE:  The replacements are just as poor. Every disc skips, stutters and doesn't play as expected. I will return both of these and steal the content - these jerks really expect that more of us will accept an order for media we cannot legally copy (bluray does not allow for backing up content legally)... that enough of us will just eat the difference... it's no wonder that people won't pay for digital content on hard copy anymore - i'd rather download all eight movies illegally and risk infecting my computer with viruses than pay someone to provide me with two seperate sets of discs that DONT EVEN WORK in a brand new bluray player. Bonus - I have to pay the return postage!  UPDATE 2 -  Don't even bother - this is an $80 piece of polished garbage. I would rather spend five years in federal prison (because that is the only screen that actually loads) than pay another $80 for hard copies that WILL NOT PLAY. Chalk me up as another potential paying customer who chooses to steal the content rather than pay for a product that is NOT worth the money you have to pay for the privilege of finding out that the discmakers are doing it wrong.

0525478817|5.0|All of them. The Fault in Our Stars was was on John Green's finest works, and in the time I spent reading the book I sobbed, I smiled, I laughed, and then I sobbed again.<br /><br />Though in some aspects it mirrored John's previous novels ([[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]], [[ASIN:0142410705 An Abundance of Katherines]]), it was in every way its own story<br /><br />Some dismiss this book before reading it because they claim  can't handle a story about a girl with terminal cancer. The Fault in Our Stars is much more a poignant take on the human experience than it is a book about cancer.<br /><br />Buy this book. Buy it for your friend, your neighbor, your parents, your niece, nephew or child. This book is one for the ages.
1563894696|3.0|This graphic novel is ideal for young comic readers (13-14) who have matured beyond standard action superhero stories.  Adult readers may find it falls short of the expectations set by stories such as Year One. It comes off as an obvious attempt to blend superhero comics with more credible fiction (mafia films, detective noir) in order to seem adult, rather than simply telling a superhero story with those elements in a mature way. The resulting mixture is too heterogenous and too derivative (moments stolen from the Godfather and the overtly Chandler-esque title are particularly painful). The dialogue seems written to make a 13 year-old think he or she is reading something for real adults; the unintended humor of moments such as Batman screaming \\"Catwoman!\\" (as he pursues her off a rooftop in a dramatic scene with implicit romance) betray any real adultness in the story.  But what is particularly disturbing about this being near-tops on everyone's \\"Best Batman Stories\\" list is the fact that Batman does very little here. In fact, the writer managed to adopt one of the worst traits of much Detective Noir fiction - the protagonist playing little part in the story other than, \\"being caught in the middle of things so that the audience can have a narrative,\\" (This issue plagued Blade Runner). Batman beats around some thugs, pulls a trick or two, but does little to drive the story and stumbles through the mystery - ultimately failing to even solve it.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|If you are looking for a fun loving romantic and funny movie, this is it. JT and Mila shine on screen and mesh so well in this movie. It's a borderline chick flick, but to be honest, I couldn't care less because it's funny, entertaining, and just a pretty good movie overall.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|Just picked this up at the store a few hours ago so I haven't had a chance to go through and watch the entire Blu Ray yet, but I had a chance to delve through some of the bonus material as well as the first 2 episodes on the set (rest assured that I have already seen the season in it's entirety on HBO when they had a day long marathon before the second season premiered).  As far as this release goes the only con I have seen is that the season wasn't put out until the second season finished up, but that doesn't affect the product itself, so no stars off.   From what I have seen so far, the picture quality of the show in HD is brilliant and the effects look amazing. Watching the show on HBO even in SD I kept thinking \\"Why does this look so digital\\" and a quick trip to the bonus section answered my question.   Anyway onto the show itself: I was reading some of the lower star reviews and noticed that people have said this series is bull and not true to history and stuff and I just need to say, get over it. No historical based films and TV shows are ever 100 percent true to life and that isn't bad, its called taking artistic license and its been done since the days of shakespeare. Look at what was created and judge it for what it is. In my opinion its a briliant show.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|My family and I don't usually see movies in theaters, but for some reason in 2011 we saw A LOT, and this was the best one hands down. After seeing it, I kept checking here at Amazon to preorder it as soon as possible, and now I can't wait until the 24th!!  As for the movie it has something for everyone, men, women, and kids. My 14 year old daughter who generally doesn't like any kind of sports movies (thought that's all it was about was boxing) even loved it! The previews don't do it justice though. I thought it looked good from them but wouldn't have seen it in the theaters if it was up to me. It was my son's turn to pick the movie, and he had friends who had seen it and said how good it was, so he picked it, and I'm so glad he did!!  Like I said best move we saw last year, and you won't regret getting it. If you still aren't sure, rent it On Demand (Amazon is generally A LOT cheaper than cable company especially if you wait a few weeks may get it on sale) first, but I guarantee you'll want to buy it for you home collection if you enjoy re-watching movies.

B003AMAOW4|4.0|Surrounded by a bunch of hitlerian S.A.looking Brabant soldiers, Elsa is laying bricks in a cheap looking vacation bungalow under construction.  Lohengrin who is depicted as wearing a shiny armour arrives, sporting jeans and an untidy T shirt which is a good idea as he will later help Elsa and paint a door. He carries a stuffed swan in his arms -perhaps in view of the following night's dinner- while a tennis referee on a high chair seems to act as the herald etc...  Mr.Jones,If you are thinking of Parsifal for your next destruction (oops production) why not set it in Africa with Parsifal and Klingsor throwing coconuts at each other and the Graal knights dancing in grass skirts and bones in their noses?  If one can bear this sad result of the time's growing illiteracy, the reward is a magnificent cast of voices, Jonas Kaufman perhaps the best Lohengrin since L.Melchior, Anja Harteros a beautifully sounding Elsa, an outstanding Wolfgang Koch as Telramund, a superb Herald by Evgeny Nikitin, only Michaela Schuster's Ortrude is not always as brilliant as the rest of the crew. Kent Nagano's direction is flawless.  Buy and cut the TV monitor, just keep the sound, it is splendid!

B0029O08WA|5.0|I have bought every soundtrack of the 4 movies. This is by far, the best of the 4. You can listen to this track, as a separate album, even if you haven't seen the movies. Many soundtracks are appealing because you know the scenes in the movie. This soundtrack can stand alone. The orchestra does a beautiful job with the pieces and the music is lovely. You can feel the intensity of the movie, the feelings of love and loss. Desplat is excellent.
B000B8QF14|4.0|Item was shipped standard and came before Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised that I received the album so soon. Item was received as described. Highly recommend. Would buy from seller again. The only problem was that some of the teeth (the plastic parts that hold the cd in place) were broken. This was because of the rough handling through shipping, it was not the seller's fault, the packaging was great.
B005VGYA68|1.0|I looked forward to viewing this blue ray product however it does not play.  I am not sure if it is because it is a UK import running on an American machine or the product is simply defective.  Disappointing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is really cool..... I love the games some are a lot harder then others. I love the thrill of getting points and unlocking new games..... its beast....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|hubby, daughter and I love this app.  games are simple yet still challenging.  ads pop up now and then, but its not an issue.  cant beat it for a free app.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Don't pay attention to all the one star reviews. Those were before the game got the update. Great game if your a WoW or RuneScape fan. A lot of quests and a good fighting system. A lot like WoW, except much, much cheaper! Totally worth it!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol was a hit! Although its two hours and thirteen minutes were quite lengthy, it was jammed packed with action, and kept you on the edge of your seat. Well, Tom Cruise starred in the movie, so it must be great! He exquisitely portrayed strong leadership while he was also ambitious. He set his goal to accomplish the \\"mission\\" and not to what seemed to be \\"right\\". One great component of the movie is that the actors had humorous dialogue in serious situations.    MI4 was appropriately rated at PG-13. I recommend anyone 10+ up to go and watch the film. Though if you decide to take your young ones, they will surely appreciate the awesome gadgets used. For example, wall climbers were used to climb up the largest building in the world. The spies even took a picture of a wall and then  put the image on a screen that deceives the eye, and makes you believe the wall is where it always was, even though there are people right in front of you.    You might be wondering by now  what the movie is really about. A Russian ruler steals nuclear power codes, it is Tom Cruise and his crew's job to stop him before he blows up the world. The movie displays outstanding visuals of famous buildings and places across the globe. Really, the only con on the movie I am able to think of is that I finished my popcorn before the previews were over. In fact, that might have been a pro considering that I was more able to focus on the movie's theme of pressure. The group was working face to face with live terrorists that had the potential to blow up the world, and they had to keep their composure. Now, your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to go see Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is good for passing time and a little hard but it makes u ambisious to pass it. u will love it.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great, even better than the TWC weather app.  Works well and has a very nice User interface.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Running extremely well on my Pandigital Nova, so far nothing has happened that would make me rate this lower. My only problem is it won't work on my Ally lol. So many people rate this bad because of device problems. Notice, &quot;device&quot;, not app problems. Either get a better device, or stop whining. I &quot;downloaded&quot; this as the FAOTD, whenever that was, and I didn't complain, because I knew eventually I would get a device that could run this. But what do I know about better devices, I don't pay the phone bills. I just have patience. That, in my opinion, would make the Appstore's ratings closer to the Markets ratings
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is a good one.  Does exactly what it says.  Solitaire.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  I find myself coming back to it regularly.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Annie Lennox poured her heart into this collection of mostly traditional Christmas hymms and folk songs. A few songs are produced with a modern flourish that remind the listener of the Eurythmics, but perhaps I'm projecting here. Annie's full throated singing and well crafted arrangements make this album an essential addition to my Christmas music collection.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I thought to myself... Finally! A supernatural love story that wasnt written for a teen audience and its promising NY times bestseller on the cover. I immediately got lost in a book of magic, other worldly creatures and a sexy vampire. Diana, the main character, started off being self sufficient, confident, and strong. Then, instantly she became so pathetic and boring, and needy I felt like jumping into the book and slapping some life into her. Meanwhile her sexy, mysterious vampire became overly protective, obnoxious and an alcoholic. Half the book was her drinking tea and him drinking wine. The romance was basically non existent and action wise... Spongebob square pants has a more interesting life. I'm so thoroughly disappointed in this book. I wish I would have read these reviews first. What a boring book of gibberish non sense.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My daughter loved this toy. It was a great 1st toy. She could turn on the sound and lights by touching the mirror and not having to push down on a button. She loved looking in the mirror and chewing on the antennas. Don't think it really helped her learn to crawl. We received this as a gift and would def buy it for someone else.
1609419693|2.0|When I get Tina Fey, I want funny, sarcastic, and more funny. There is a lot here but also a lot of memories that are more melancholy than you might expect. I almost wish I'd gotten the Kindle book instead of the audio because the tone of hearing it might make it darker and \\"droopier\\" than it really is supposed to be.
B000FC1PNE|4.0|Colin Bridgerton was considered by those among the ton as the charming, good natured one of the Bridgerton sons.  Deep insided, he longed to have his own identity born of something more substantive than those adjectives.  Penelope Featherington has surpassed the respectable age for participating in the seasons for the marriage minded and is settling into her role as that of a 28 year old spinster, along with her best friend, Eloise Bridgerton.  She's been in love with Colin since she was 16 but only from afar.  Penelope is the bright, intelligent one of the Featherington sisters but also the shy, quiet one who has never been able to capture the eye or attention of a suitor.<br /><br />I know this is considered to be Colin's story but for me it's where Penelope shines.  Her sense of humor, wit and intelligence are at the forefront and the story is so well told that you're left with the same query Colin has...why hasn't anyone noticed this woman before?  I was very pleased that the romance never felt one-sided, as if it was some fluke on Colin's part that he falls in love with Penelope.  She's much more appealing than most of the vapid women comprising the London aristocracy and holds her own throughout the book.  Colin is adorable and he becomes more endearing when he doesn't run from his feelings but reaches out to understand and embrace them.<br /><br />This is a well written tale of what appears to be, on the surface, the romance  of two opposites who couldn't be better suited.  Penelope brings out the best in Colin and he, in turn, gives her the confidence to believe in herself.  There is a scene when he is at a Featherington family gathering with Penelope that took my breath away.  It is one of the highlights of the book.<br /><br />We also learn the identity of Lady Whistledown, which added lots of fun and intrigue.  Most of the Bridgertons appear as well, engaging in snappy, lively dialogue that moves the story forward very nicely.<br /><br />I'm still loving this series and am anxious to start the next book.e next book.
B005V20JKI|4.0|The game itself is fun and addicting.  You play through several levels until you reach the boss stage where you have to avoid the boulders he throws at you without smashing them.  The graphics are great for a phone game.  Occasionally the game will lag with character changes in the first several minutes of gameplay. My biggest gripe is that the updates (additional levels and characters) found on the android market are non-existent with the amazon version.
0385344228|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" is one of those rare novels that grabs your attention from the beginning, is almost impossible to put down, and then haunts you long after you've finished it.<br /><br />Author William Landay opens with an enigma: a former assistant district attorney is being grilled by an old colleague in front of a grand jury.  The ex-A.D.A. tells us that his testimony is too late; he then begins to narrate a convoluted tale revolving around the murder of a teen-aged boy ... a crime that his own son is eventually accused of committing.  We then flash back to the time of the murder, and the father walks us through the investigation and the trial and its aftermath, along a path riddled with twists and turns and surprises - including some shocking truths that are rooted deep in the past.  The genius of the plot is that Landay keeps referring the reader back to the book's opening pages, keeping us constantly off guard by reminding us that we're being teased along by a mystery that is embedded in a larger puzzle.  The final revelations are deliciously and thrillingly unexpected.<br /><br />\\"Defending Jacob\\" is a superb blend of mystery and suspense mixed with enough courtroom drama and family psychology to satisfy devotees of all these genres.  I heartily recommend it, without reservation.  It deserves a wide audience, as well as all the awards that are almost certainly destined to be bestowed upon its author.
B0058VW36U|5.0|the game looks and is really good on the screen. its fun, a little difficult at some parts, but for the most part amazing. once I got it I just couldn't stop. way better than angry birds!!
B004BJMEO6|2.0|The best thing about this film is the chemistry between Necar Zadegan and Traci Dinwiddie. Unfortunately, the film's dialogue is so cringe-worthy it makes this movie truly difficult to watch at times. I really wanted to enjoy this movie--it is so rare that there are lesbian films with genuine sparks between the leads. Which is why it is that much more tragic that this film is ruined by musical overkill and dialogue that bludgeons you over the head: \\"Every time I think it's impossible to love you more, I do, ever deeper.\\"<br /><br />I was surprised at just how many four and five star reviews this film has received. This movie has acquired amazing actors who have signed up for an excruciatingly bad script. Soul mates? An angry pastor? \\"Twin flames?\\" Fainting? Really? Was the self-help guru an attempt at humor? Finally, there is one strange plot wrinkle that I couldn't make heads or tails of: how is it that a Pastor allows his son, who seems to still be in high school, to have a live-in girl friend?<br /><br />Stock up your bar and watch this with some of your lesbian friends. Drink every time you hear the clarinet or a piano solo.

B004ZNACA6|1.0|This is merely another rip-off to entice aging baby-boomers to shell-out big bucks to re-re-purchase the same recordings by their aging rock heroes over and over. Pink Floyd fans who fail to rush out and buy this set will feel somehow disloyal to their heroes, but no amount of \\"remastering\\" (and just what does that mean?) will transform analog recordings originally made on four-track tape into HD 5.1 channel, 96kHz-sample-rate, 24-bit sound.<br /><br />Furthermore, for a box touted as \\"The Complete Studio Recordings\\" there's remarkably a lot missing from this overpriced set. Obviously, the early singles aren't included here<br />See Emily Play<br />Arnold Layne<br />Candy and a Current Bun<br />Apples and Oranges<br />Julia Dream<br />(and other songs found on the Relics album)<br />The last of these is important because they often performed it live, and it heralded Roger Waters emergence as the band's main songwriter.<br /><br />More important are later singles such as<br />Point Me At the Sky<br />and the studio version of<br />Careful With that Axe, Eugene<br /><br />Most important of all are songs which never appeared on a Pink Floyd album, but are marvelous songs nonetheless<br />Give Birth to a Smile<br />The Embryo<br />That one's definitely worth having, and they often performed it live when first using the quadrophonic system they pioneered at the time.<br />(Roger Waters introduced it as, \\"A song of what it's all about.\\")<br /><br />Missing, too, is the fine music they did for Michelangelo Antonioni's awful movie [[ASIN:B001TK80CA Zabriskie Point.]] Although the two-disk set of the music from that movie contains other bands and about a half-hour of Disk 2 is just Pink Floyd noodling around in the studio, it's worth having for<br />Heart Beat, Pig Meat<br />The Crumbling Land<br />Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up<br /><br />The last of these is just \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\" again, and Roger Water's bass is (typically) out of tune, but The Crumbling Land is Pink Floyd going Country & Western, and it's one of their best songs with dramatic stereo effects. So if you don't have those songs, do yourself a favor and forget about this set and get the [[ASIN:B0000033TH Zabriskie Point Soundtrack.]] (That link is to the 2-CD set, but if you can find it, the original one-CD reissue is preferred, unless you can stomach a lot of Jerry Garcia.)<br /><br />Perhaps, when EMI gets around to re-re-re-re-issuing the same songs in a 50th-Anniversary Deluxe re-re-re-re-mastered gold-surfaced box set with holograms, all of the above will be included, so why not wait 'til then.  You can resist skipping at least one set of reissues and not feel disloyal, can't you?Land is Pink Floyd going Country & Western, and it's one of their best songs with dramatic stereo effects.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the one of my favorite pass time and stress relievers. I recommend this to my family and friends!
B005KN5AES|5.0|Immortal Soul is some of the best \\"traditional\\" metal to come out in years! Riot fires on all cylinders on this much anticipated effort and for a long time fan of music and heavy metal in general this is a satisfying listen. There's speed, aggression, passion, frenetic fretwork, soaring vocals and killer drumming. These guys are accomplished musicians and show off their talents without going overboard. Some of the standouts for me are Riot, Wings Are For Angels and Sins Of The Father but my personal fave is Fall Before me, which is a mid-paced down-tuned sludgy effort, kind of different for these guys and Tony Moore's vocals are just fantastic!!! With repeated listens this just gets better and better. Can't wait to see them here in Rochester....
B005HSL626|4.0|good on kindle fire. ads aren't as bad as it seems. does crash for me rarely but its not bad. very addicting game.

B004FOA84A|5.0|LOVED this game it was just too short.  Would totally buy a similar but longer version.  This is the only game of this type i have seen for aneroid...really hope to see more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like this ap but not sure why I have to say so in so many words.  seems good
B0054JZC6E|2.0|sure, there's lots of games but i didn't really like any of them.  Guess i prefer quality over quantity. Did work fine on the Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun to waste time on.  One thing that stinks is that you have to earn A LOT of points to unlock new games.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has created an excellent work that addresses some of the big questions of death, most most importantly of life, in a way that makes the process incredibly enjoyable. I've read all of his other works (including that awful Zombie Novella), and I was not immediately intrigued with the description of his latest book. But after reading the whole thing in a three-hour marathon I can safely say that this is possibly my favorite book John has written. I was able to see a lot of the plot coming, but the basic plot details are not the important aspect of this book, the real story is how Hazel and Augustus deal with their place in the universe. Thank-you John Green!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game there's lots of games Wich  make the game more fun the points make it more of a challange and there's a lot of fun games
B005Y423ZC|3.0|I bought this DVD to find out just who \\"Adele\\" was, and why all the buzz.....well, not being a fan, I found her to be quite a vocalist, and writer of torch songs...I guess if I could understand what she is saying most of the time, both when she speaks, and when she sings, I would be a fan.  I like the fact that she seems to be \\"everyday people\\" and no airs.  If I could only get exactly what she is saying.  I listen really hard and I catch a phrase here and there, and they are really good.  So, I did enjoy this DVD, thought it was overall good.  Would have given it more stars if I understood it better!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|not bad for free looks real cheap filling space to get points to unlock games usual zynga trash two more done
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works fine on my fire. No problems at all and looks great.  My weather needs are pretty basic: what's the temp now, what will it be later, what's the projected forecast for the next few days, and if we are traveling, what will the weather be at our destination. This app provides all this info (and more) in a great, intuitive format.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I was very happy with this app when I first for it. I  used to be able to download music but after the recent update I no longer can which downloading music was the whole reason I got this app. I was really disappointed so I uninstalled this app. :-(
B002MUAJ2A|1.0|I heard it was a good book and wanted to listen to it on my kindle. Opened it up on the kindle - text to speech is not enabled.   Now that I look at it, they're selling an audio CD together w/ the kindle version. So, if I want to be able to read the book and occasionally listen to it while I'm driving, I have to drop $35 (kindle+audiobook). Thanks, but no thanks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game. just wish the ads were not there. not that easy to beat but I like the challange. lots of fun.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is so profound and moving, that I do not feel that my review can do it justice. TFiOS treads the line between all human emotions: Joy, fear, shock, incredulity, and humor to name a few. This is a book that, without giving spoilers, explores some of the deepest and most asked questions of human existence while never being condescending or self-righteous, and with no attempts to merely hand the reader the answers. TFiOS is that rarest of books in which you can both laugh and cry on the same page, a book that draws the reader so intimately in that in the course of the novel it becomes real. John Green's works exhibit an uncanny knack for making the fictional world become real for the reader, and TFiOS is no exception. It develops complex and believable characters with assets and flaws the same as any real person. TFiOS is truly exceptional in the sense that it understands that \\"Young Adult\\" does not mean that the reader is uniformed or ill-equipped to handle real themes and real issues. Much like Paper Towns and Looking For Alaska, TFiOS gives the reader just enough discussion of deep and meaningful questions to encourage exploration while offering new insight into the world in which we live. John Green's ability to imagine complex characters is on par with the greatest of all literature. TFiOS is, in short, a masterpiece: beautifully sculpted as only a genius could create.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most of the games are pretty easy but some will a little time to master. overall pretty good app would recommend

B000F3AAUW|3.0|Few weeks ago I saw their concert in London on HDnet. I was blown away. Some of the best soul,funk,r&b I've ever heard. They were playing real instruments.   I was disappointed after listening studio versions of both albums. Sounds like any other hip hop or whatever they call this new music.

0446573019|1.0|Reasons why this book is a suprising piece of trash:  1.  Baldacci's \\"John Puller\\" central character is a virtual plagerization of Lee Childs \\"Jack Reacher\\".  Anybody who has read Child's Reacher series will say \\"I can't believe it ... John Puller is almost a copy of Jack Reacher!  2.  The book is poorly written and his research was apparently much like the title \\"Zero\\".  3. His concept is totally unbelievable ... He has a bunch of country Yahoos in conjunction with a rogue U.S. Army CID agent building a Nuclear Bomb capable of wiping out a half dozen states in a shutdown & sealedup bomb factory that they somehow get into by climbing through hidden coal mine shaft. Even less believeable, these bad guys somehow carry off a bunch of 55 gallow drums of high radiation plutonium to sell to for \\"billions\\" to other unnamed bad guys who supposedly will use it to do bad things to the U.S.  All the Top Military \\"Brass\\" apparently know something \\"very bad\\" is about to happen so they send \\"one man, CID agent John Puller\\" out so solve the problem.  The entire concept is totally ludricous and rediculous to anyone who has an ounce of knowledge about radiation, nuc bomb technology, the Military, the Federal Government agencies, etc. I was so disappointed with how the entire plot was ultimately revealed that I \\"almost\\" through this book in the trash.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|This movie is a flaming waste of your time. Please, if you have any love for yourself avoid this like an STD. Why? Well, only because it is one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is horrible. The film is almost soft core porn. I mean, I expected to see a long blade-like thing slaying people, but not old Conan's man sword if you know what I mean. The acting was bad, the story was predictable, and the way the film was shot was horrid. All in all, an awful waste of time. JUst avoid it and save your time for something more enjoyable, like cleaning the toilets.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This was a very good thriller/mystery novel...after about 100 pages. The Vanger family characters are complex and intriguing, most of the characters in the novel are well-written. After the excitement in the middle, it slows to a grinding halt towards th end of the novel. If you have a long enough attention span to make it to the action in the middle of the novel, then you should enjoy it.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|I thought this movie was a great treatment of what could have, or what might have, happened if the government found aliens on the moon in the 1970s. Three astronauts are sacrificed to see what the aliens are capable of, and how we can combat them. Would the government do that? Maybe, maybe not. But this book offers a view into what would happen, from the astronauts perspective, if the government did this. It is well done, and looks very authentic. It was well worth watching. Get it and enjoy.
0525423281|5.0|I was excited about this book from the second I heard the title. Sure, I loved ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS as much as the next person, and sure, I knew this book would be fantastic. But the thing is, this book held a special place in my heart because (in case you don't know), my daughter is Lola :)<br /><br />LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR by Stephanie Perkins (Dutton, September 29, 2011)<br /><br />Fans of ANNA will not be disappointed. In fact, I'd go as far as saying I enjoyed LOLA even more than ANNA. It's not going to be a mystery to anyone that, yes, Lola and the boy next door will end up together. But Stephanie Perkins does such a fun job of bringing them close, pulling them apart, bringing them closer, pulling them farther apart, and then...bringing them together forever.<br /><br />My favorite part of the entire book is the costuming. I adore how Lola dresses up however the heck she wants (maybe because it reminds me so much of my own Lola).<br /><br />So if you've been looking forward to LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR, you're going to love it! Highly recommended for seventh grade and up.
B005PW3OS8|2.0|This was a supreme letdown. I was expecting something that was as cool, smart, and brave as the comic book. What I got was a bland rehashing of some hero-like story that was too focused on being politically correct rather than true to the comic book. This simply made it annoying and boring, rather than aspiring or relevant to today's kid. All in all, this was a fatal flaw with the movie. The acting was good, but this made the movie almost unwatchable. Get it, but be ready for politically correct hero-like antics. :(
0312641893|5.0|I have to start by saying I love this book. As far as big-hype books go, this one totally hits the mark! I love when that happens :)<br /><br />I remember being pitched this book at NCTE like a year ago by one of the marketing peeps at Feiwel & Friends and adoring the idea of cyborgs replacing standard humans in fairytale retellings. So I waited patiently until ARCs were available.<br /><br />CINDER: BOOK ONE IN THE LUNAR CHRONICLES by Marissa Meyer (Feiwel & Friends, January 3, 2012)<br /><br />Aside from the general premise, I really wasn't sure what to expect. Many of the elements played right into the retelling of Cinderella. And the thing was, instead of feeling done-before, these elements were totally (totally) endearing. But aside from the awesome retelling part of the story, what really set CINDER apart was the future setting complete with a reworked world government, huge medical advances, and a race of special humans who live on the moon. Combine that with some wicked family dynamics, hot romance, and an author who is not afraid to kill off characters, and what comes out is a story that is not to be missed. I'm already waiting for the next book in the series (oy, why must it take so long?).<br /><br />CINDER is highly recommended for fans, seventh grade and up, of science fiction, fantasy, or fairytale retellings who are looking for something fresh in the market. I'll definitely put it in my top reads of the year. Totally worth checking out!<br /><br />Source of book: From publisher by request
B005FITIGO|5.0|This movie portrays the actions of people who are caught in a situation in which they know that their world is about to come apart. In watching this one you will see how much they come to respond to self-preservation in making the decisions they make. Their actions as portrayed in the movie are obvious to all of us who have been in such situations. The acting is great, the script is never slow, and the production is first rate. What you will get from watching this movie is the sense that you had a first hand seat as the economy nearly crashed in 2008. It is also entertaining besides being very insightful. Get it and enjoy!!!!!

B006UAWH2S|5.0|This is a provocative and thoughtful movie about the loss of senses. Well written, cast and performed, this movie might drag you somewhat unwillingly into what it really means to be a sentient being. But the journey proves to be well worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing and awesome I play it all the time and have a blast. this app is the best app in.the world.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very fun and addictive! save up to buy more games- I'm enjoying it so far- only downside are the adds.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Players may find Quell similar to Oxyd, a classic ball puzzle game from the 90s on the Mac.  This game features a single move interface more suited to a touchscreen, with many puzzles mechanics and obstacles similar to Oxyd.  This is an exceptional puzzle game and a must download for puzzle afficianados.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The videos really sold me on this cover for my Kindle Fire.  Marware (not to be confused with Malware...i know right?) makes a great low profile cover for your Kindle Fire. It has a really sleek design, soft but durable texture/material, and just as in the demo video does exactly as advertised.  No funny smells, no gimmicks, a the reduced price of $29.99 it's even more of an attractive purchase. This case hardly adds any bulk to the kindle at all and is designed to almost feel like it belongs on the kindle. I'd imagine you could buy one of the zipper sleeves and fit that in there as well...otherwise, perfect for a brief case, laptop bag, or any bag really. The additional elastic strap easily keeps the cover flap secure.  The cover flap as well is on a hinge so it should stand up to a lifetime of opening and closing without the normal wear and tear of a flap that is not hinged. The interior is soft and won't scratch any of the kindle's surfaces and there's a satisfying muffled \\"thump\\" when you let the flap close.  The company name/logo is also very subtle on the case which I also like, I suppose if this case were designed by Marc Jacobs some ppl would want it to be big and bold. I prefer my electronics and their cases to be uniform, low profile, and sleek. This case does that.  I'd give it 4 stars for price but I gotta give 5 because I saw the video, everything met my expectation from the video, and I made my decision based on the look and design again from the video. There's really no other super low profile case like this out there that I've seen and I do in fact love this case.  For $29.99, yes most definitely...how would I improve this? Price maybe? but the kindle is still hot so accessories are going to be a premium, for what you get it's a sound investment.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great to pass time, however, lacking instruction for game play and is tricky with the finger control, but it is free.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy, Free, Works great.  I use it for many things and I keep thinking of more. I wouldn't have a device without it!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The video was delivered promptly and the video was all I expected it to be.  There were no problems with the delivery or the product.  The Big Bang Theory is one of the funniest sitcoms currently on TV.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a fascinating book to read because it was written so that you, the reader, could get some type of grip on who Chris Kyle was and what he experienced not only in the heat of battle but what he faced at home as well. It was especially interesting to hear from his wife, Taya, and how she felt going through this period in their lives. You have to be a special individual to put your life on the line for your country and even more special if you go through the rigorous training involved in becoming a SEAL or a member of one of the other \\"special\\" forces in the military.  While reading the book, I often thought of the line Jack Nicholson's character uttered in \\"A Few Good Men\\", \\"you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall!\\" and all I could think was that I was glad that Chris Kyle and his sniper brethren were \\"on that wall\\" time and time again protecting their fellow miltary men and women and ultimately us as well.  Chris Kyle's personna throughout the book was pretty much what I would have expected it to be. You do not go through all of that training and punishment if you are not a bit of a bad ass. The fact that he went about his job the way most of us do our jobs is a credit to his training and discipline. When the \\"bad guys\\" are trying to kill as many Americans as they can, someone has to take action to stop that and that was Chris Kyle's job, and he did it better than anyone else.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game it works great it is so fun and addicting i just dont know when to stop playen and it is so easy to get coins for more games!
B0068RHGJM|4.0|In terms of musical growth, Imaginerium is not really far off from Dark Passion Play.  The musical style is just what you would normally expect from Nightwish.  This is not necessarily a bad thing; every album I've ever heard from Nightwish feels like it has taken an immense amount of work.  Nothing is ever done half-heartedly.  While, I am more of an \\"old Nightwish\\" fan, I can still very much enjoy their new work.  Since a lot of what I was thinking about this album has already been said by other reviewers, I'll just go through the major strengths and weaknesses instead of through a list of all the songs.  Strengths:  - The songs on this album have actually been written for Anette's vocal range so it no longer sounds as though she is straining herself all the time (as it did in Dark Passion Play).  While I wouldn't go as far as to say I really like her singing much, she does sound much more comfortable and there are a few places that she does shine - mostly on the slow songs when she is not competing with the orchestra.  \\"The Crow, The Owl, and The Dove\\" is a beautiful piece incorporating the best Anette and Marco's singing.  Marco, as usual, is a wonderful vocalist and I'm glad they gave him the amount of singing he deserved.  - Yeah, yeah slow songs.  We know we all want the epic, highly orchestrated pieces that Nightwish is well known for.  \\"Ghost River\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album.  Marco sounds deliciously evil with his vocals and the layered complexity of the song is perfectly done.  It does take a few listens - it did not immediately stand out to me as the best song on the album.  \\"I Want My Tears Back\\" is another highly catchy, addictive song with celtic motifs very similar to \\"Last of the Wilds\\" from DPP.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers who didn't like the celtic feel - I think Nightwish pulls it off very well and I would like to see more of it in the future.  \\"Last Ride of the Day\\" is another very typical, catchy and epic Nightwish song.  I also liked \\"Rest Calm\\", despite its weird mix of a metal verse with a slow, gentle chorus (the chorus is very memorable).  - We have yet to see how these tracks will be incorporated into the movie but from what I've heard, I think this album will be awesome as a sound track.  The flow between songs is well done.  The creepy carnival feel occurs several times.  There are multiple tracks with snatches of a children's chorus.  There are songs you feel really would create a certain mood in a movie - \\"Scaretale\\" and \\"Arabesque\\" being two.  Weaknesses:  - I think the major flaw of this album is the lack of that one big signature epic Nightwish song that ties everything together.  Century Child had \\"Beauty of the Beast\\", Once had \\"Ghost Love Score\\", and Dark Passion Play had \\"The Poet and the Pendulum.\\"  Tuomas certainly does try with \\"Song of Myself\\", which clocks in at 13 minutes.  A good 7 of those minutes are just poetic talking that gets very boring after you've heard it once.  The song itself falls rather flat.  It's loud and bangy and big but it doesn't really have a memorable melody or much interesting about it at all.  Also, the first single of the album - \\"Storytime\\" is a good song but it just really isn't up to the standard set by \\"Amaranth\\" in DPP.  - I know I put Anette's singing as improved from DPP on my list of strengths.  So that strength was somewhat relative.  I still feel like Anette's singing is a weakness of the band.  With minimal orchestration she can do well but that's not what Nightwish is about.  In the highly orchestrated, big numbers she seems to be fighting a losing battle to be heard.  And I know her weird scratchy singing in \\"Scaretale\\" was there to match the feel of the song but it still makes me cringe.  It isn't pleasant to listen to at all.  - There are two many slow songs on this album.  I know that we do need to stop for breath sometime but still.  \\"Slow Love Slow\\" is just plain boring, as everyone has said, despite havingan experimental bluesy feel for Nightwish.  I just skip straight through it.  \\"Turn loose the mermaids\\", while more musically interesting that \\"Slow Love Slow\\" still seems a bit tedious.  I did like \\"Taikatalvi\\" (good intro and always like Nightwish giving a tip of the hat to their Finnish origin) and \\"The Crow, the Owl, and the Dove\\" - with the usual Marco trademark of far better lyrics than most Tuomas songs.  Come to think of it, Tuomas should really let Marco do all the slow song writing and maybe have a greater hand in lyrics overall.  Although I really like the melody of \\"I Want My Tears Back\\", the way those lyrics fit into the song is particularly cringe-worthy.  Bottom line: I expect this will be a must-have for all Nightwish fans and I really look forward to seeing how the tracks fits into the movie.  It is a solid album, though not Nightwish's best.  For those who have never heard Nightwish before, my favorites are Once, Dark Passion Play, and Century Child, in that order.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Its a really good game, I just don't like the fact that after skipping the ad at the beginning of the game, it exits out and plays the ad anyway halfway through my spider game.
145162445X|5.0|I like to be challenged in my thinking.  This book does just that and in a well written, easy to follow manner.  Nice analogies and explanations that the layman can digest and follow.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has many games that are fun too play and are very addictive,I recommend this game,it is great for long trips and works good on my kindle fire
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I am loving this app for its aesthetics and usability but I second calls for nested tasks. Also I only seem to be able to sync one list with my google tasks. is there a way to sync them all?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how I can take the bible with me where ever I go, I use this app on my tablet and phone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and passes time wonderfully. I would. definitely recommend this. games of various difficultly. so you are never bored with it.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I laughed out loud over and over. I didn't want to love Darcy, but I did. Great light read by a smart, gutsy writer.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It gives you a few games and you have yo earn points by playing those ten games in order to &quot;purchase&quot; more games, each set costing more than the previous. You don't get very many points through playing the games either, so it takes awhile to earn enough points. Be aware you are occasionally stopped in the middle of a game with an ad appearing.
B002WN35DC|1.0|las ilustraciones son ESENCIALES en este libro, hacen a la trama del mismo. es una l&aacute;stima que esta versi&oacute;n carezca de ellas.<br />esto hace que el pago -cualquiera que sea- resulte excesivo.<br />no vale la pena
B0052ZQMLO|1.0|I downloaded [[ASIN:B0052ZQMLO Collins Concise German-English Dictionary (Collins Concise German Dictionary) (German Edition)]]Dictionary (Collins Concise German Dictionary) (German Edition)  into my android kindle (Galaxy2-Samsung) and i can not use it as a default dictionary at my german ebook (as it says at the kindke books shop).  I am very disappointed !!!  This is not a fair trade !!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|5 star i like all the games especially the cookies game but the snake!  why so many 1 star? guys,  be patient
B0054JZC6E|3.0|too ad oriented. should be more geared towards the games. don't me get a quite on my auto insurance to posy this, mediocre at best, games...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of those novels that you can't put down no matter what else you have to do with your life! This is a great dystopia novel, although yes at times it has very teen-like romance problems. However, I would definitely classify some of the themes as adult-like and wouldn't necessarily expect to see this novel being read in middle- or highschools anytime soon.
B005DZMP00|5.0|and I already love it. I am one of those freaks who purchased this, yes, for the Bickershaw Dark Star>Other One alone, for the same reason some commentators have: I've not found an adequate quality boot of that show, ever, and according to chroniclers and audience members, it was one of the spookiest, most Celtic-ritual, prehistoric conflagrations ever. Rainy and cold, too--why do you think they call it \\"England\\"?! This probably explains Bobby tuning mid-Other One.   So while I am usually something of a \\"completist,\\" wanting only the full show, and am an avowed audio snob etc., I believe this release does a few very important things, and thanks to the kind reviewers here, I am reasonably assured of its quality. Wigan, England has been one of those missing gems for me, and this finally brings it!   I also have to agree with the reviewer who commented on the size and scope of the original LP, which I purchased in early 1983. It was a freaking tri-fold helicopter LZ with a gigantic catalogue of tour pictures and the story of the Bolos and Bozos. And that was it. The Bolos, the Bozos, some pictures, and three 33 1/3's of insane music.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun and challenging a good time user. it has a lot of games but some are almost impossible nearing the end
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun but some games are not nice on the kindle fire as there is simply to far to play well.  I'm going to download on my phone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a good stress reliever!!! fun games to play when u r board, especially at work lol... I very much recommend. this app.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|all the games I could play seems the same only with different backgrounds and game play direction. game was slow and laggy. and all the ads didn't help either. its kinda sad this free game cost me something I'll never get back. My time, that is. Don't waste yours with this game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it all the time to save stuff from my computer and then read it on my tablet or phone. Love it!!!!
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|overall the reader is fine for reading regular text content nonline.  However, in contrast to my iOS reader, its weak in handling images and especially videos.  It rarely shows them directly, forcing me to toggle between feed, web, and cache in a way that I never have to with my iOS reader.  Offline mode is relatively weak for the same reason.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best because you can keep earning a lot of money and you van get more games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is an addicting game with its variety of games and stages.  As one progresses through the games, one would get the sense of achievement.  Of course, points could be bought but getting them through playing is more fun.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|Loves this movie.  Recommend to Adults only.  Funny with some sad parts along with a feeling of something good going on.  Minus the Diaz and Jude sexual relationship, everything else seems excellent.
1613820895|5.0|The last chapter in this book, alone, is worth the full price.  Every believer will easily identify with the thinking that led G.K. Chesterton to embrace the Christian faith.
B0058WFO06|5.0|This is certainly one of those albums you might not \\"get\\" the first couple listens, even if you're already a fan. I was a bit worried about this one, to be honest. The last solo album (Insurgentes) contained a few amazing tracks, but I routinely skip half of them. When I heard Steven Wilson was doing a bunch of King Crimson work I cringed and said to myself \\"Oh, well that explains it.\\" I never really enjoyed KC all that much, and the knowledge that this album would probably contain quite a lot of influence from them stained my initial reception.  Perhaps I'm getting older. Maybe now I would like KC better than I remember, but for whatever reason, I really love Grace for Drowning. I find myself waking up with \\"Sectarian\\" already playing in my head. There is a sax (or maybe clarinet) solo that gets in my head and won't go away. \\"Deform to Form a Star\\" has some very beautiful harmony vocals (all Wilson, I believe) with a gorgeous electric piano bit at the 4:30 point that I am going to have to learn how to play. \\"Belle de Jour\\" is a phenomenally beautiful piece, somehow sad and uplifting at the same time.  At one point I would have said there isn't a stand-out track that I can think of. I really quite like them all, individually rating the songs between 4 and 5 stars in iTunes. But the more I listen, the more one track stands out above the rest: Raider II. It's odd, dark, foreboding, highly experimental, eclectic, and many other things. But this is certainly a track that one must study numerous times before making a judgement. It builds very, very slowly and ominously into something amazing and unique that I quite frankly don't have the words to describe. This song goes just about everywhere during its 23 minutes of life. It will challenge you and take you to musical places you may have never gone before. Most amazing is that this song has become the most requested by my children (10 and 7 years old): they love it, and I hear them humming the primary theme several timesduring the course of a day. If there's nothing else to be satisfied with, it's the fact that my kids are choosing music like this over the substance-free crap their peers all listen to.  Grace for Drowning will challenge you and take you to musical places you may never have been before. For this reason, I almost guarantee you probably won't get it the few listens. To be certain, I wasn't even sure I LIKED it the first few listens. It's not easy to listen to, by any means, and if you're not in the mood to be challenged, save it for a time when you are more prepared. After a dozen or so listens, I'm prepared to say that this is most certainly a masterpiece at all levels.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|free fun and so awesome!!!!!  u can play a ton of games in free tottaly awesome app it rocks. have fun playing it
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This DVD set of \\"Secretariat\\" has become an instant favorite for me. Any child can watch this as it doesn't contain anything PG or worse. No beating of any horses, no foul language, etc. It's so refreshing to know that they CAN make excellent movies without all of the trash. The acting in the movie is also a bright spot. You can't go wrong when there is quality acting. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a addicting game very fun good purchase a very.good app for the kindle fire!!the games on it are very cool

B000056VJ8|5.0|Received this order promptly.  Great service.  Will use again.  Recommend this vendor.  Too bad my hubby already had it and I didn't know.
B0063GORYU|1.0|I don't like the jerkiness in the play. it doesn't have the fluid play as other free spider games I've played. Also the deal option can't be set as a default, so selection has to be made each time.
0316044695|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" is one of those books that can really change the perspective of the person reading it. Throughout the story, Luttrell describes the many hardships he had to face in order to to become a SEAL, and also explains the order of events that occured during one of his missions that lead to the greatest loss of life in SEAL history. This is all written very well, and kept my attention through till the end, and even if you have no interest in the army or the SEAL's, it is still a great story full of deep life lessons.
B003UESJHE|1.0|Firstly, this is a great movie that highlights the actors credibility.. so i should mention that the 1 star isn't for the actual movie but for amazon.com performance.  I ordered what is clearly listed and noted in the description. What i got in the mail was a canadian issue of the movie.  If i wanted the 'Alliance' edition of this great movie, i would have logged into amazon.ca and bought it from there.  Shame on you amazon.com for shipping me the canadian issue of this movie without informing me before hand.. if you did, i would have cancelled my order. Shame.  :(
B0068RGVMK|5.0|First of all, let me say that this is a huge improvement from \\"Dark Passion Play.\\" I'll admit, while Anette does come across as a sweet, likable, vivacious woman, her contemporary vocal style is just not my cup of tea. I'm a much bigger fan of Tarja's unique, majestic operatic vocals, but this album does give me more respect for Anette.<br /><br />Of course, the heart and soul of Nightwish is the leader, keyboardist, and main songwriter of the band, Tuomas Holopainen. Not only are his compositions magically cinematic, his lyrics tell pages after pages of wondrous stories, often with themes that focus on childhood and dreams and nightmares. This theme continues to Nightwish's seventh studio album, Imaginaerum. It is a concept album that tells the story of a composer who falls victim to old age and severe dementia. As he is dying, he loses all of his memory of his adult life, his family, his friends, and his daughter, until he has nothing left but the memories and imagination of his ten-year-old self.<br /><br />Imaginaerum is not only an album; it is also an upcoming film of the same name and same story, with music also provided by Nightwish and their newest album. However, while the album accompanies the film, it can also be enjoyed on its own. Here is a review of the thirteen tracks from, not just a beautiful album, but also from a touching story that I hope won't disappoint when it hits the big screens. I did some lyrical analysis, much of which I could have misinterpreted, but this album definitely speaks to me, as I have a fondness for childhood nostalgia and imagination.<br /><br />1. Taikatalvi<br />The opening track, which means \\"Winter Magic\\" in Finnish, begins with the windings of a music box. As a lullaby-like melody tinkles out, Marco Hietala, the male vocalist of Nightwish, demonstrates his capability to sing gentler songs. Although the entire song is in Finnish, the song is so reminiscent of a magical winter night that, despite language barriers, one could feel as though one is being swept up by the enchanted snowflakes of a winter wonderland.<br />5/5<br /><br />2. Storytime<br />The lullaby from the last track leaps into an energetic, optimistic song of childhood imagination. This is the leading single from the album, sung by Anette Olzon, the female vocalist of the band. The lyrics references fictional characters such as Peter Pan, Alice from Alice in Wonderland, and Gaia from Greek mythology. Despite its contagious bubbliness, and perhaps being one of the most radio-friendly tracks on the album, the entire song is merely the opening act to a circus of dreams and wonders.<br />4/5<br /><br />3. Ghost River<br />Power metal kicks in with guitars at the beginning. A duet between Anette Olzon and Marco Hietala demonstrates a popular motif in the gothic metal genre known as \\"Beauty and the Beast vocals,\\" which is used to describe a contrast between angelic female vocals and agressive, growling male vocals. Unsurprisingly, this song has been described as \\"a duel between the Devil and Mother Gaia.\\" Later on, they are joined by a children's choir to add a layer of innocence to this theatrical number.<br />5/5<br /><br />4. Slow, Love, Slow<br />This is Nightwish's first jazz-influenced song, inspired by 1930's American nightclub music. While many Nightwish fans debate that Anette's contemporary vocal style is unsuitable for the metal genre, there is no question that Anette is in her element here. Smooth, smoldering, and seductive, she is elegantly accompanied by a sultry backdrop painted by the piano and the saxophone.<br />3/5<br /><br />5. I Want My Tears Back<br />Personally, I felt like this is a cringe-worthy track. While I loved the Celtic instrumental interlude, this whole song just sounded too bubbly, way more bubbly than \\"Storytime.\\" And I cringe a lot at this Alice in Wonderland reference: \\"Where is the wonder where`s the awe/Where`s dear Alice knocking on the door/ Where`s the trapdoor that takes me there/Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare.\\"<br />2/5<br /><br />6. Scaretale<br />A dark, bombastic seven-and-a-half minute song about childhood nightmares. It starts with a children's choir, singing \\"Ring Around the Rosy\\" as if they were broken mechanical dolls, and then vocalizing as they drag the listener deeper into a moody, circus-y, Danny Elfman-esque atmosphere. Anette sounds particular witchy, and sings of a children-eating bride, squealing pigs, a pool of snakes, and fallen mirrors. Welcome to Cirque De Morgue!<br />5/5<br /><br />7. Arabesque<br />The macabre topsy-turvy traverses into a dramatic Middle-Eastern-influenced instrumental track. It sounds as if a frenzied chase is ensuing across miles of desert sands underneath foreboding moonlight, all just underneath 3 minutes.<br />5/5<br /><br />8. Turn Loose the Mermaids<br />The previous turbulence mellows out into a sweet ballad of a kite flying high in the sky, a long journey, and a life long-lived. Though this is a mere conjecture, perhaps the line \\"The mermaids you turned loose brought back your tears\\" is meant to metaphorically describe nostalgia and the recollection of long-lost memories, which is perhaps what this song is meant to induce in the listener.<br />5/5<br /><br />9. Rest Calm<br />At this point, the elderly songwriter, who is the central character of this concept album, is upon his deathbed. He reminisces of his memories, which he hopes will never let him go. At the climax of the song, the children choir sound like the manifestation of nostalgia, making the old man's memories rest in his dreams and smile back at him as if nothing else exists.<br />5/5<br /><br />10. The Crow, the Owl, and the Dove<br />A breathtakingly beautiful ballad between Marco and Anette. It opens with an acoustic guitar, and both of them bittersweetly ask not for love, faith, wisdom, pride, beauty, nor rest, but for innocence and truth. They encounter a crow,  an owl, and a dove, respectively envying its pride, sense, and love, but realizing they needed nothing they had. At the climax of the song, guest vocalist Troy Donockley sings in another language, \\"Go to the river, you'll find fairyland.\\"<br />5/5<br /><br />11. Last Ride of the Day<br />Inspired by being on a roller coaster, this song was written to describe approaching the end of life and enjoying all that life has to offer. Existence is described as a beautiful theme park ride with an \\"incredible high,\\" and the \\"carnival of life\\" consists of us chasing our dreams, in an adventureland of metaphorical tricksters, magicians, jugglers, and snakecharmers.<br />5/5<br /><br />12. Song of Myself<br />This is the final song that features vocals, and is a 14-minute epic divided into four parts, each respectively titled 1) From a Dusty Bookshelf, 2) All That Great Heart Still Lying, 3) Piano Black, and 4) Love. Remnants of a great imagination, and a piano slowly rusting after the death of the its master, is lyrically showcased here. Songwriter Tuomas Holopainen says that this was inspired by the Walt Whitman song of the same name, and after Anette's voice bows off the stage, segments of the poem is recited as an orchestra solemnly plays. I kind of wish the poem recitation wasn't included. Without it, the song would have just concluded neatly and elegantly, but it just drags and becomes overkill. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but...<br />4/5<br /><br />13. Imaginaerum<br />The final track is an instrumental medley of the Imaginaerum`s main musical themes. Each of the previous tracks is musically referenced here, like a waltz through the flipping pages of a richly illustrated storybook. This is definitely a ride upon a enchanted roller coaster through a theme park of life, rich with a child's imagination and a heart that never ceases to love and create and dream. This is a circus of wonders, an uplifting ride upon angelic wings that circles around multi-hued castles, soars across an ocean, and gazes out into a transient, brilliant sunset that blazes just as it immerses into an evening ocean of moonlight and a starry sky. What a beautiful way to end an album.<br />5/5<br /><br />I only hope that the film will live up to the magical adventure!<br /><br />Here is a modified review that I wrote for UC Berkeley's Caliber Magazine: [...]r, you'll find fairyland.\\"  5/5     11.

Song of Myself  This is the final song that features vocals, and is a 14-minute epic divided into four parts, each respectively titled 1) From a Dusty Bookshelf, 2) All That Great Heart Still Lying, 3) Piano Black, and 4) Love. Remnants of a great imagination, and a piano slowly rusting after the death of the its master, is lyrically showcased here. Songwriter Tuomas Holopainen says that this was inspired by the Walt Whitman song of the same name, and after Anette's voice bows off the stage, segments of the poem is recited as an orchestra solemnly plays. I kind of wish the poem recitation wasn't included. Without it, the song would have just concluded neatly and elegantly, but it just drags and becomes overkill. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but...  4/5     13. Imaginaerum  The final track is an instrumental medley of the Imaginaerum`s main musical themes. Each of the previous tracks is musically referenced here, like a waltz through the flipping pages of a richly illustrated storybook. This is definitely a ride upon a enchanted roller coaster through a theme park of life, rich with a child's imagination and a heart that never ceases to love and create and dream. This is a circus of wonders, an uplifting ride upon angelic wings that circles around multi-hued castles, soars across an ocean, and gazes out into a transient, brilliant sunset that blazes just as it immerses into an evening ocean of moonlight and a starry sky. What a beautiful way to end an album.  5/5     I only hope that the film will live up to the magical adventure!  Here is a modified review that I wrote for UC Berkeley's Caliber Magazine: [...]
B00030DEQE|5.0|I needed a gig NIC as the integrated Realtek chip did not play well with ESXi.  The Intel was one of the NICs that was recommended, and it had glowing reviews.  It was installed, and Vmware took it from there.  I have two of these now and both are performing just fine.  I would not hesitate to purchase another if the need arose.  Just a good quality product at a reasonable price.
B005B3T45I|5.0|I bought this for my 21 year old music loving son as a Christmas gift.  He was thrilled and excited to find out that with a tape deck you can convert cassettes to MP3 as well.  We had a great time adding my old records and his new ones to my computer and is iPod.  It was easy to set up and use, very well packed when we received it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun and easy to play.  Exactly what a free game should be. I would recommend this game to people who like solitaire games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|hours of entertainment. no instructions can make for certain amount of frustration. great for mindless distraction. great during downtime on the job or at home
0316056863|1.0|I'm not sure how to tell Tina Fey that I don't like this book. It can't be insulting because I don't want to be quoted in the inevitable sequel and have fun made of my name or where I live.  I can't just state it bluntly, apparently this will make it more a statement of my character than the contents of the book. I guess I could live with the book for a predetermined amount of time until my opinion becomes valid but I really don't want to do that.  I suppose all I can do is have an awareness that I didn't enjoy the book and know the right thing to say, but never act on it and just put it all down to an overriding movement, let's say chauvinism and hopefully that will excuse this vague halfhearted review.
B0039208QM|5.0|This was a gift for my son-in-law. I assume that he was pleased with it since he requested it. I was pleased with the fast shipping.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I here this its the worst game ever u get one game to start and u cant unlock anything.unless you buy things I would never recomemd this game
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The album is stunning, some very well written tracks, and a good mix of styles.  The chart stuff is there, and his songwriting, and professionalism shimes through like a beacon.  If you like him, it's him back on form.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|That app.is great I can type essays on the computer with out being near the Cpu I got this for free from amazon and did not put it down for 2 days
B0000025D0|5.0|A good range of tracks, and a great new style and voice, raise this above the dross that comes out of the States.  The work he puts in, comes through and is well worth a listen, and adding to your back catalogue.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun. Fun way to pass the time. Some of the games are a little hard. but fun still trying to win.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Lots of twists and turns and memory jolts of my childhood surroundings. You think you have it figured out and bam...another turn in the story. Great read, great ending...just super great!
B005UT29Z0|2.0|Starts out slow and never got any better.  It was boring.  Good thing it was a free rental.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone.  If you work in banking or stocks, then it's a movie for you.  Especially if you want to hate Wall Street anymore than we already do.  Full of deceit and corruption.  A good old boys network only out to protect themselves and line their pockets.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Simply won't work in web form fields of any kind. Use a special character, begin overwriting at the beginning of the line. Backspace dupes the entire word.
B005O9BB8W|4.0|I think this is the best album from FFDP. It's got heavy riffs and the lyrics to some of the songs speak to me. I did have to take one star off for Remember Everything though. That song blows!! (sorry)  And yes some of the songs do have that techno digital sound it. Miss the old days!
B005NA3B8U|1.0|Crashes my toshiba thrive after one level, can't play because it crashes my toshiba thrive tablet every time I try to play.
1451627289|5.0|The three word review is this:  Read it now!  This is a great book by a fantastic author.  King does an amazing job of fleshing out the 1958-63 time period, down to the last detail.  The characters are fresh, vibrant and the main ones all go through tremendous changes.  I won't spoil anything here, and I am not sure any review will quite do this book justice.  For any fan of King's writings, for any history buff, for any student of the Kennedy's...this is a must read.  By far the fastest I have torn through 850 pages in my life!  The Stand is still my favorite novel of all time, but King's 11/22/63 is right there with it.  Why are you still reading this?  Buy or download this book NOW...I dare you to stop reading after the first chapter...  Amazon Customer  Sioux Falls, SD
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome fun played for hours first time I played it addicting, some games not so fun but most are. try it out you will like very much
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|I just can't get it to show newest first and have to scrool down and down.  I just log into the web.
B0059XTUMC|1.0|Didn't we see something s-l-i-g-h-t-l-y similar a few decades ago?  \\"Singing in the Rain\\"?<br />Gene Kelly should Sue ..... Sue too!<br />Ugh .... another 5 cent miracle!
B000683VI4|5.0|Finally saw the movie for the first time in December.  Loved the movie so much I decided to order the movie for my dvd collection.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I got this CD after seeing a tv concert of Norah Jones doing these songs and I really enjoyed it. There's a new twist to her songs here and great variety.  I love it.
B006INDMEE|3.0|This movie was so-so for me.  The story had a lot of promise, but the movie just didn't bring it home.  The beginning was excellent:  Totally engaging espionage thriller, awesome acting, keeps you on edge of your seat -- basically, not boring!  The middle was okay:  It's present day, everyone seems to be going about their lives and then suddenly, the one former agent steps in front of oncoming traffic and kills himself.  Now, you're like what in the world could have caused him to do that???  The ending was 100% disappointment: You're expecting some crazy action pact, edge of your seat-like events to unfold (it should be as good or better than the beginning).  You expect Helen Mirren to kick some former Nazi butt.  You expect to understand why the one agent killed himself.  Well...it's all very unfilling.  It felt like the person that wrote/directed the movie got lazy and just wanted to finish it.  If you're going to finish it in a nursing home, make it a little more exciting.  Would I watch it again? No.  Would I recommend it to others?  The story is a good one, and I could see some people liking the movie.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a great game for Hidden Object gamers.The graphics are good, gameplay intuitive with alot of levels and a few minigames thrown in.<br /><br />There is a story mode or you can just go straight to the hidden object games if you prefer.<br />There also is a setting for Timed or Relaxed(not timed) gameplay.<br /><br />Hints are available from the start.To earn more hints keep your eyes peeled for question marks(?)during the hidden object parts of the game.Each question mark is worth one hint and generally there are a couple in each search.<br /><br />There are two different Paranormal Agency apps.One free and one paid.<br />G5 games seem to all have these options.Play the free one to see if you like the game before throwing down some cash.It is a win/win situation.If you like it,buy it.If not,delete and go on to something different.<br /><br />I will definitely keep my eyes out for the next G5 game release.<br /><br />BTW,game played on Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is awesome. al the different translations and highlighting is so cool. I would definetly reccomend this app. definetely AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
B005KELQEU|2.0|This really is too big to fit the Kindle Touch.  I mean, I guess it will protect it like I want, but the Kindle Touch can literally shift inside of this thing.  I got a good deal on it, but it's definitely not worth full price for a Kindle Touch.  I believe the actual Kindle is slightly larger, so it might fit better.

0545403359|5.0|The movie War Horse is an amazing movie.  The acting was very good with fantastic actors and all the actors were appropriate for the characters.  The visual effects in this movie were also very good.  However, the war scenes were a little too gruesome for my taste.  But in some ways, the graphic scenes really get you into the movie and make you want to keep on watching.  Even though this movie is long, it is an appropriate length for the story line and does not feel like it is being dragged on.  The climax is thrilling and you don't want to stop watching.  The rating is appropriate because the war scenes would not be appropriate for children under 13.  It is non-fiction. The movie was based on a book, which was based on a true story, so it a little altered.  This movie did not give away the ending at all; in fact the ending was a very big surprise.   This movie is a story about friendship, hardship of separation, and of war, as well as family and perseverance.  The story is about an extraordinary horse that survived through being separated with its mother and then being separated with the boy who bought it. The horse was sold for war.  The boy who raised the horse lied about his age and went to war to find his horse.  Both the boy and the horse go through fatal things that nearly have them killed.  It is an inspiring and magical story that makes you feel anything is possible if you persevere, try really hard, and have hope.   The themes of this movie are friendship and perseverance.  It is a friendship between friends', animals, and humans to animals.  The friendship between this boy and the remarkable horse is so strong he risked his life to go to war and find the horse.  The horse in the beginning of the movie, before it was sold to the boy, had a very close relationship with its mother.  The boy also made many very close friendships with people.  It really shows you the power of friendship and what you can accomplish with friendship.  The theme is also perseverance because the boy would not stop trying to find his horse even though it was nearly impossible.  Also the boy at the beginning of the movie persevered so much to try to get the horse to plow (since this is why they bought the horse).  This movie has a sentimental story line that really gets to you personally.  I recommend it for all children 13 or older and adults of all ages to see.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|you start out with only a few games and have to play and get points to &quot;buy&quot; the rest. game play is fairly easy. some games are very sort but you rack up points fast and get a lot of bonuses which helps keep interest. its ok
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a pretty good game.  I really like it.  the games are all really fun and interesting.  it has really good value.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|My 9- and 6-year old boys love Big Time Rush. We watch the show all the time, and I had purchased their first CD via Amazon when it came out. They insisted I get \\"Elevate\\" also. They listen to it non-stop and I have to say, I find myself singing along and listening myself, even when they are not with me! My favorite songs are \\"Music Sounds Better with U,\\" \\"Elevate,\\" \\"If I Ruled the World,\\" \\"Superstar,\\" and \\"Show Me,\\" but really they are all good. Catchy, fun, danceable. Good stuff. I was able to score tix to their concert in February, and I am looking forward to it as much as the boys are!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are very fun but the amount of points needed to unlock each game is way to high. If that could be fixed the game would be great.
0553386794|5.0|Tyrion and the wall,<br /><br />It has been some time since I've taken the time to share my thoughts on a book I've read.<br /><br />Currently I'm standing on a wall of ice 700 feet high with a curmudgeon dwarf of a man and a boy and his wolf.<br /><br />I've not been as captivated since my first read of moria.  Please keep it up George, I need the distraction of your great writing to lead me from the mondane world.<br /><br />Sincere thanks!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its great to have so many games when your bored or to entertain children but its not fun its more stradegetic. but it is nice to have
B004LUS390|5.0|Well I think it lets you be creative and your self.Everyone who has a ipone,ipad,kindle fire should get this app.
B0025KVLU6|3.0|Great service from Amazon with fast shipping.  That said the actual set isn't that great.  I hadn't heard of some of the songs but figured I liked their other cds so why not give it a chance. If I'd had the option of hearing some of it before buying, I would have passed on this set. If you're someone who buys a cd for a few good songs this may be a good buy for you.
0439023513|5.0|If you read this book from just how you want the ending to be ... you'll find it not so good. I'm a late reader of the series and have to say I was dismayed by the poor reviews that Mockingjay got. How Suzanne Collins had an \\"agenda\\" when writing this book. So I decided after a few chapters to read through Katniss' eyes. How if I had gone through everything she has thus far, how I would feel. Not too different, and I could empathize with her. She got with who I wanted her to be with, not really caring how they got there, just that they did 'cause they were both worth it. If you read Mockingjay keep in mind that most of us have never been subject to the horrors of what Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch or any of those characters had gone through and maybe its impossible to even understand the feelings that could create in people but try. You'll have a hard time otherwise. It really is a great novel.
B000TGCR38|5.0|This was a gift for Christmas. I only buy gifts I like myself. This movie I got from The Netherlands, in Dutch. I was impressed with the story.   The movie came in time, good packaged, like the seller told me. I can recommend the movie and the seller.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good for kids to play its fun and challenging and so cool I rated a 5 but its hard for me
0743487486|5.0|This book has been very useful to us. I read it over and over. It gets to the heart of the matter. I gift it to all the parents I know. All parents need to read it! Your kids will thank you...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|omg wen I like first got this game I was like this no fun but then after I played the games I was so thrilled I played for like an hour
0525478817|5.0|WARNING: if you're trying to maintain a tough-guy image, read this book alone. Tears will be jerked. Life will be affirmed and mirth will be felt, but mostly tears will be jerked.  It is young adult fiction, and like most of John Green's books, it's a fast read. I read it in one sitting without too much difficulty. I plan on reading it again someday, which is as high a recommendation as I can think of.  Also, my copy was signed with a GREEN Sharpie. :P
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. I read the book and convinced my mom to read it as well. We went to see the movie together and were amazed at how perfect the movie was. It stayed true to the book and did not leave any important details. I even made my boyfriend watch it with me and (although he probably won't admit it in public) he really enjoyed it too. The actresses in this film are awesome. I will be shocked if none of them win an Oscar.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this game. its fun to play but I wish that you did not need to have so many points in order to unlock games. points are easy to get however!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|These are not the \\"originals\\" as the packaging claims. Very misleading. Why would they present this as something it is clearly not?
B004VMVTNU|5.0|For me this is definitely a must-have app. Works beautifully on my Galaxy Nexus and lets me wake up just exactly how I like to wake up.
0525478817|5.0|I don't usually write reviews. In fact, I believe this is the first time I've written one on Amazon. This book, however, deserves a review. I'm not talking about a synopsis of the book detailing out all the nuances. I'm talking about an honest-to-God opinion on this book.  I laughed, I cried, and I loved it.  Not only has John Green written something that's witty, he's captured suffering, darkness, and love in a book that feels very real and leaves me wondering if I've learned a lesson or two from it. All I can say is that anyone can pick up this book and read it--it's a delightful, honest, smooth read that I absolutely had to sit and read cover to cover in one sitting.  Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this  is a fun game to show off too your friends lol so fun for multi player 2 la la la la la la la la la la jk
B000025RX4|5.0|Great CD I never knew existed..I had the live version..then I came across this item  and had to have it for my collection. 42 years in coming...Thanks for the chance to grab this!

B0063IH60K|5.0|good Way to pass time. before. I know it I have been playing for hours. it never gets old at old
0439023521|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, which is odd because I don't usually like this sort of thing. Once started, it was impossible to put down! I HAD to know what happened to the resilient and amazing Katniss! My teenage daughter insisted I read this and I am so glad she did!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so amazing! its addictive and so much fun!! when I start playing its so hard to put it down. its the most exciting thing ever and you're gunna love it
B000VBIGD6|5.0|As many have said, this goes down as not only my favorite \\"Vacation\\" movie, and my favorite \\"Christmas\\" movie, but also one of my \\"Top Ten\\" all time favorites !  How can you not sit and watch Clark try to put together his \\"all time favorite family Christmas\\" without feeling his frustrations ?  The characters are \\"characters\\", the dialog hilarious, and \\"Eddie\\" really knows how to dress and behave around people ;-)  I will bet you can find just one scene that reminds you of your Christmas past because there are sooooo many to choose from ! So sit back with some of Clark's famous eggnog \\"OOO, that's good!\\" and enjoy !
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Pretty fun. it's a good time waster and offers a lot of different types of games. good choice if you want to devote a length of time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I just got this game to pass some time and it is more addictive than just passing time. I would reccomend it
B000007XUQ|5.0|I wanted them to come out with a cd version of Christmas Portrait the way they had in record form for years. To my disapointment all they came out with was that special selecions or whatever they call it. I didnt look close enough at the title the first time I saw that and unfortuneanally bought it. So now that they have both of  their Christmas albums in one collection I finally have what I want. White Christmas is my favorite Christmas song. It was through this album that I first heard The Christmas Walz.The First Snowfall is another one. That was a medley with Let it Snow but nevermind. On this album most things were. Another Christmas song that was new to me was their own Merry Christmas Darling. Im a Christmas fanatic as you can tell and any time I find a Christmas song I havent already heard of well lets just say Ill try anything Christmas. This two cd set is excellent. Merry Christmas.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I've shown this movie to one or more of my classes probably a dozen times and it's still enjoyable.<br /><br />The story is set among a group of Maori in present-day New Zealand. The two main characters are the chief of this group (\\"Paka\\") and his troublesome 13-year old granddaughter (\\"Pai\\"). The grandfather loves Pai as a granddaughter but also blames her for \\"the troubles,\\" which he believes started the night she was born. (Her brother, who should have become the heir, died at birth, as did the mother; the father, Paka's eldest son, was so distraught that he fled New Zealand and established himself as an up-and-coming artist in Europe -- abandoning his people, in Paka's view.)<br /><br />From the beginning, Pai shows unusual talents and interest in \\"the old ways,\\" but Paka cannot see it because of his obsession with a male heir. At one point he gives up on his family and starts a school to find the potential heir among the first-born sons of the tribe -- with rather unpredictable results. If Amazon had a 6 star rating, I'd give this movie 6.<br /><br />The casting of this movie is brilliant. The conflict between Paka and Pai sizzles and the supporting characters (notably Paka's wife and Paka's two sons, the father and the uncle) are brilliant. Even the walk-on characters, like the other tribe members and the boys who attend the school are great.<br /><br />The scenery is fabulous and the story unfolds in a beautiful way. The movie is enjoyable on so many levels -- as good entertainment, as an inspiring story, as an interesting perspective on a different culture, or as a story on the generational conflict, families, and love.
0525478817|5.0|I am a huge fan of John Green, he has long been one of my favorite authors. This work is yet another example of his superb mastery of the 'coming of age tale' and of his excellent understanding of the young adult mind. I ordered this book for my kindle and could not put it down. Well done Mr. Green. DFTBA.
B001FB55H6|3.0|Making a film of this graphics novel is like trying to condense Proust's Remembrance of Things Past into a Classics Illustrated comic book.  The graphic novel is so well constructed, so packed with story, so multi-layered, and so well put together, that it would really take about a 7 hour movie to do justice to it.  In order to fit the Director's Cut into roughly 3 hours, all of the Tales of the Black Freighter subplot has been removed as well as all the inter-chapter materials from the book, which provides an incredible amount of important back story.<br /><br />That obviously creates a problem, because the counter story of Tales of the Black Freighter are incredibly important elements of the whole plot.  That said, the movie is enjoyable.  The special effects in Blu-Ray are well done.  There are some great lines from the movie.  My favorite is \\"You've got it all wrong.  You think I'm locked up in here with you.  But, really, you're all locked up in here with me!\\"  For a three hour movie, I did not find myself looking at my watch, and that is also unusual.<br /><br />However, I would recommend passionate fans of the graphic novel to look for the even longer cut that brings in the Tales subplot, as it is seminal to the story.  I've not seen that, but I think it would improve the experience of the story a lot.<br /><br />But the very best thing to do would be to read the graphic novel before watching any version of the movie.  This is the graphic novel rendered as very serious literature with, as the theater people like to say, exceptionally high production values.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|It can do reminders, recurring reminders, priorities, due dates, and once you understand it, it can really be handy as the producers name suggests.
B004XQO90E|5.0|If you watch this movie, and I think you should, don't get too invested in how the scientific premise is explained as the movie unfolds, because that is the one weak part of the movie.<br /><br />But the rest is a delight.  It's tightly paced, very well acted (and I am not a big Jake G fan), and oscillates between a completely grounded in the here and now of today scenes on a Chicago Metro train versus the otherworldly place that Jake's character finds himself after each episode on a train.  The two female characters are really well drawn and performed and I thought both actresses did a great job.<br /><br />The film is slightly reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers because the last ten minutes turns positive in tone when a sad ending would perhaps have been more appropriate.  I think for the writer and director, this is a coin flip decision, and they made a choice that works.  It would have been interesting for them to add an alternate, darker ending as an extra.<br /><br />I find most science fiction films these days to be way long on special effects and way short on plot or concept.  Source Code is a major exception to that rule, and I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a clever story, smart direction, and some very good acting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game works well, no advertising or interuptions.  I like it to keep busy and mind active.  With music in the background it is good distration.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice look and feel on the Kindle Fire.  It seemed slow at first but it isn't now.  Maybe the Fire update fixed it.  Whatever I use it several times a day and it never disappoints.
0525478817|5.0|This is almost entirely just copy and pasted from an immediate reaction post I made on a friend's Facebook wall, and I would have written a separate review but I think there are already more than enough for everyone to see why they need to read it.  \\"I think I need to reread it; I know I sped through some parts too fast to fully appreciate them. It was...more than I expected, already, though.  For a few days, I was kind of secretly anxious as hell. When I got it and actually held it in my hand, I was really excited but also afraid it wouldn't live up to the seemingly unfair hype we gave it. I mean, we didn't know that much about it anyway. He had an idea of who two of the characters were. We knew what the cover looked like. We knew it'd be autographed.   We just had faith in this fantastic writer. And....it was well-placed. I laughed, I cried, I was cliche as anything. Whatever man. It was a profoundly /good/ book, and the characters were remarkable, and I can say with no hesitation that it was the best book that I have read in a very very long time, and definitely the best he has published, ever. I hope to see students studying these in English someday. And I'll be damned if it doesn't earn him the right to attach more stickers to the book covers, this time shiny and metallic and very very award-y.\\"  Buy it. It's fantastic.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Freezes and is unplayable on Galaxy Nexus or any other Android 4 / ICS device. This is a well known issue and PopCap does not appear to be interested in fixing it.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Man! I got this for christmas and I totally love it. It rivals miazaki. (is that how you spell it? Oh well)<br />Anyways, I'm at the moment a 17 year old inspiring artist, and I saw this laying around one of the movie shelves, and I thought, \\"how colorful looking. I think it would be interesting to see.\\" And my parents overheard, and bought it for me. They were right to. The story is extremely charming, with delightful and realistic characters, as well as crazy, intense scenes where at the last moment you're rooting for them too.<br /><br />I would defenetly recommend this to all my friends. I wish I bought it sooner!
B003U6HQGW|2.0|I don't doubt that the walk or something like it took place but the confessed lack of notes, maps or diary combined with the passing of time since the event and the significant guesswork employed takes the edge and the enjoyment off what turns into a rather monotonous story of escape, but such places did and do exist and people have escaped. In this case as a survival story it is an physically unlikely account of extended endurance in a hostile climate by men in a weakened state, and when you add in lengthy encounters with Yetis at close quarters and the temptation to close the book grew strong. I would imagine that the naming of names of the people in the prison camp would not have brought their gratutude. But for 99p it passed the time.
0062112430|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I picked it up because I loved \\"Before I fall\\" and once I did, I couldn't put it down. Her writing style is so easy to read and absorbing that you simply forget everything, except the story in front of you. I completely identified with Lena and fell in love with Alex. I loved watching Lena grow from a scared, young girl into a strong, independent woman in love. I should have known what was coming at the end, but I hoped that it wouldn't end that way. Still, I can't imagine the story being any different than it was. It was perfect.

B005QPGHQU|2.0|I was so excited to hear the new album, but when it started I knew it was going to be a dissappointment. I am all for growth as an artist and a new sound with new members, but even their lyrical composition is a step down. I think this was a rushed project by all parties invovled. Evanesance told all their fans a new album was in the works,  and when  it was scraped they had to deliever something. In the music biz money is the bottom line for those who have invested in you, so putting out what surely is not their best is to be expected. Not a terrible album, but not one I would listen to again and again.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game looks boring, but it is unbelievably fun! About the ads, they are full screen, but they only come up after half the games. And in no way are they inappropriate. It's either ads for businesses, the Top Girl game, or Fruit Ninjas clothes. That's it. And all you have to do to get out of them is push skip or the back button. Also, if anyone has the Shadow Blade, HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET IT!?!? I have every blade but that one and Bamboo Shoot(and that's just cause I haven't had the app for five days yet). You should really try this out. You will not be sorry.

0312641893|5.0|Despite being based on one of the most famous romantic fairy tales of all time, Cinder by Marissa Meyer proves to be a fresh and exciting read for readers of all sorts. I love to read, but I'm a slow reader and a reader that needs real excitement in order to finish a book. That said, I'm happy to report that I finished this book in two days. This means, I REALLY liked it.<br /><br />Cinder starts off quickly and the easy, swift pacing is held throughout the book. I'm also not usually a fan of sci-fi stories, finding them hard to relate to and get lost in, but Meyer does a fantastic job of creating a vivid reality of Cinder's world while still keeping the book easy to follow and absorb. What's more, the author seems to make Cinder's world so real by creating unique technology that is still easy for us to relate to. For example, in Cinder's world they rely on \\"portscreens\\" and \\"netscreens\\" for communication, news, etc. I found it realistic and easy to imagine these things as future advancements on tablet computers and our modern flatscreen TVs and computers. It's very easy to see Cinder's life in New Beijing as a very realistic possibility for earth's future. This makes the sci-fi aspect of the book easier to handle for folks like me, who usually are lost in sci-fi fantasy.<br /><br />Cinder's story is very much like the classic Cinderella in many ways, she has an evil stepmother who keeps her as a slave, two stepsisters, and an uncertain past. When her paths cross with Prince Kai, Cinder is thrust into an unlikely romance. I have read a few reviews here that criticize the ease and \\"love at first sight\\" quality to Kai's attraction to Cinder. To this I have to say, come on, this is the retelling of a fairy tale! It's supposed to be \\"love at first sight\\" and \\"true love\\", and the reader should be expecting this. Much to my pleasant surprise, while Kai is immediately smitten with Cinder, she--on the other hand--does NOT turn into some swoony, pathetic girl in love with the handsome prince (I'm talking to you, Bella Swan). Thank you, Marissa Meyer! Too many heroines of the popular young adult novels feature whiny, weak girls for young readers to look up to. While Kai is the charming, strong hero I look for in a romantic book, Cinder is refreshingly intellectual and thoughtful.<br /><br />I think many teen readers will enjoy and relate to the character of Cinder because, despite being cyborg (human with artificial body parts), she is a very real character to read. She is teased and mocked by her enemies because of her artificial body parts, and seeing how so many teens (and adults, too) struggle with self-image, I think Cinder is a heroine MANY will so easily relate to. She struggles to love herself at times, because of her cyborg parts and her downfalls, but when it really counts Cinder stands up for herself. I love this!<br /><br />The pacing throughout all 38 chapters is swift and kept me unable to put my Kindle down until I finished this story, so readers in need of excitement and romance will definitely be happy with this read. Cinder's story is full of a few surprises and twists, though it also has a few non-surprises, at the end we are left with a cliffhanger. This is one difference from the classic Cinderella story. Cinder's first book does not leave us with a \\"happily ever after\\" complete with a bow. Instead, we are still hopeful for that \\"happily ever after\\", but it's obvious there is more in store for Cinder and Kai before that is even possible. This was fine by me, however, seeing as I rushed through the book so quickly, I'm excited to read more of what happens to Cinder and Kai and I'm hoping Meyer can deliver as well as she did with this first book!<br /><br />Finally, as a mother of two young daughters, I'm very happy to say that this book gets the mom seal of approval from me! Cinder is not without it's dark and intense moments, but Meyer respectfully wrote a clean (I'm talking language and intimacy) book that I woulddefinitely share with a reader even as young as 10. Too many young adult books have been showing up on shelves lately, full of cursing and promiscuity. It's nice to see an author finally show her talent without trying to sellout to what the publishing world seems to THINK teens want/need in a book. Which reminds me, the writing was clear, concise, and impressive. I would compare it to the style of Suzanne Collins of the famous Hunger Games books. Meyer clearly has talent.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this fresh new novel to the young readers, AND adult readers who are interested in any mixture of adventure, fairy tales, sci-fi, and romanticism. I think it's a fun, fascinating read, and it kept me on edge for most of the book. I'm very much looking forward to the release of Meyer's next book--let's hope it doesn't take too long!s 10.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I received a Kindle Fire for xmas and immediately started researching covers for it because I tend to be clumsy when it comes to techy things. I found this one and was a bit skeptical. Once I got it, I fell in love with it immediately! It's lightweight, durable, and flexible. I have had it for about a month now and have had ZERO problems. An excellent buy for sure.

When I did the kinect tuner the picture had a lot of contrast to the point where only my upper body was visible. Some reviewers say that it works for them, but it didn't work for me. I would have been better off not taking the chance. I say don't bother.

0307891372|4.0|While I won't say this is a \\"must have\\" for me, it probably is for people who haven't played any of the previous games in the series. It is very well written and organized and is full color throughout.   One caveat - if you're like me and you are playing the PC version... and have added a bunch of mods, this book won't help with new item(s), spell(s), etc.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its pretty cool not the best. I hate that the game keeps.pushing me to write a review also I believe that they should give you more games for free ( without using free credits)

B0047T86G0|1.0|Perhaps I am missing something, but I can't get the dictionary on the Kindle Fire to actually find words. Well, it will find words but not the way you would expect. For instance, if you type the search word \\"help\\" the kindle will look for every instance of the word help within the text.  Not exactly useful when one is looking up the meanings of words. Insipid and utterly useless.
B006VA4NJC|5.0|Having greatly enjoyed Season 1 of Downton Abbey, I was looking forward to Season 2, and I found it as captivating and engaging as Season 1. In Season 2, the time frame is from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1919. For those unfamiliar with the series, I would advise watching Season 1 first as it provides a lot of background information on many of the characters, as well as continuity.<br /><br />Change is a major theme this season - the Great War has wrought many changes to the residents of Downton Abbey. The Granthams, i.e. the Earl of Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville); his wife, the American heiress, Cora, Countess Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern); their three adult daughters, beautiful Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), bitter Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), and idealistic Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay); and of course, The Dowager Countess Grantham, the Earl's mother played by the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith.<br />The usually robust and confident Earl (I love Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of the benevolent Earl) feels somewhat out of place this season as he yearns to be of use to his country, yet all he gets is an honorary rank in the military, and is not considered for active duty due to his age. Mary is melancholic over her failed romance, Edith wants to master driving so that she can take over in case the family's chauffeur is called up to fight, and lovely Lady Sybil goes off to nursing school.<br /><br />The staff of Downton  undergo changes of their own, and experience both ups and downs. Brendan Coyle who plays the Earl's faithful valet, John Bates, experiences some serious challenges when his estranged wife, Vera (Maria Kennedy) turns up. Tom Barrow (Rob James Collier), the footman, is away at war, but finds the experience unnerving to the point that he resorts to drastic measures to make his way home.<br /><br />There is good balance between scenes at the warfront and scenes at home. The battle scenes are credibly done, evoking all the fear and horror of the war. But I admit I was more interested in the machinations back home at Downton, and watching familiar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues. There is a short, 10-minute segment prior to episode 1 which shows the setting for Downton Abbey, i.e. Highclere Castle in Hampshire, and includes interviews with the present owner as well as the director, producer, and cast members of the show. The streaming via Amazon Instant Video is of high quality, with clear, crisp images and no interruptions.e war.

President Wilson (Danny Glover) has decided to have some parts of the world join in China to build arks since 2009 as now it's 2012 on December, a scientist named Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) fled from L.A. with his family with the help of others to head to China where the arks are for humanity must be saved.<br /><br />A very entertaining 70s style disaster film that combines Sci-fi and action together from Roland Emmerich who gave us Independence Day. Stargate, The Patriot and more. This movie is based on a fictional theory that will not happen on December 21st 2012 as it is all a scam and a fraud and i'm sure this movie is just meant to scare people which this is ONLY A MOVIE and not real. Co-starring Woody Harrelson, Oliver Platt, Amanda Pett and Thandie Norton, this has some well thought up special effects mainly with the super volcano sequences and the destruction of Los Angeles and Las Vegas, it does have flaws with phony science and cliches abound but remember folks, it's only entertainment.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has absolutely flawless picture with wave making sound to it yet the extras are decent like audio commentary, a music video, featurettes and previews to other stuff but nothing spectacular.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A reading plan for every need. Multiple translations, many with professional voice-overs. Plans are easy to use. Latest update fixed most bugs; couple remaining ones are easy to work around and will probably be fixed very soon, based on how much progress was made in the last update.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker is the second of the Fifty Shades books.  It is like a longer book divided into three parts and must be read in order.  If you have not read Fifty Shades of Grey, go do it now.  You'll thank me.  While the first book was mainly Ana trying to give Christian what he needs, this one is Christian trying to give Ana what she needs.  Ana is learning more about Christian and his past and he is trying hard to make things work.  Their relationship is intense and complicated and emotional.  If you are looking for a read that will get you all twisted up and keep you up late at night, Fifty will do it!

B002BWP49C|1.0|This whole series is so god awful its becomes unintentionally funny. Some the horrible acting, the insane storyline, the most horrible interpretion of vampires I have ever seen, this has it all. These movies are best used to make your own Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie and just rip the movie to threads. The biggest laugh of all for me in these movies was it started with vampires attending high school and then hooking up with a teenager. So to boot, these vamps are pedophiles. More unintended comedy. Just avoid at all cost if you want an actual good movie. I recommend the Tru Blood series or the Buffy series for a good vampire show, but this, this is only good for comedy.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I read all bad reviews and bought it anyway, as what i was finding in stores around Seattle looked really cheap (same price $40) and I wanted something with a bit more class (not microfibre and rubber bands).  This is it.  Feels really nice, looks great, and although i will have to 'train' it to stay closed, it is already almost there (just worked the cover back and forth a few times, laid it heavy side down while i was charging it overnight...I got it yesterday).  I don't think this will be an issue for me at all.<br /><br />If the manufacturer reads this, adding an elastic like my original kindle cover had may be a classy way to get around all these complaints that it won't lay flat with a real kindle inside (for those without the patience to work it and make it close).<br /><br />Although the elastic used to hold the kindle in looks a bit cheap, once in it blends and i don't even notice it.  I had no issues with getting my kindle fire in.  It's held nice and secure.<br /><br />I'd buy this again and i'd definitely recommend this particular one to friends.

1451648537|3.0|Steve Jobs asked Walter Isaacson to research and write his biography before the Apple CEO died, but it's doubtful that Jobs would be pleased with the result. I'm not sure that Isaacson is either, as the book was obviously rushed to press with poor editing. Isaacson had more than 50 interviews with Jobs, who also told everyone he had ever known that they should speak to the author. So \\"Steve Jobs\\", the book, benefits from unparalleled access. Isaacson presents Jobs as \\"a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing\\", and as a terrible person, which is one of the book's weaknesses.<br /><br />Beginning with the odd circumstances of his adoption by the Jobs family of Mountain View, California and continuing through Steve Jobs' counterculture youth until his collaboration with Steve Wozniak on the first Apple computer in 1975, we get a picture of a bright, obsessive young man who finds it easy to impose his will on the people and places around him. It seems just as well, as no one could ever impose his will on Steve. Isaacson focuses primarily on Jobs' professional trials and accomplishments, with side trips into his personal life, as he and Wozniak found Apple Computer, create the first fully packaged computer in the Apple II, Jobs develops the Macintosh, a blow-by-blow account of his ouster from Apple, at NeXT, Pixar, and Jobs return to Apple in 1997.<br /><br />All of the major product developments from that point on are discussed: the iMac, Apple's retail stores, the iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and iPad. At some point, the book stops being strictly chronological, as it addresses each development by topic. In addition to great access, I like Isaacson's emphasis on design. Other books about Steve Jobs have disappointingly short-changed the subject, when design was clearly foremost in Jobs' mind. I wanted to understand his philosophy of design, and this book goes into depth about the development of the Macintosh and Jobs' collaboration with designer Jony Ive from the iMac forward. Isaacson faithfully reflects Jobs' obsession on this point, which I enjoyed.<br /><br />The book's shortcomings are not insignificant, however. Isaacson does not come from a business or technology background, so he does not say as much as he could about Apple's impact on the industries it touched. And Walter Isaacson does not like Steve Jobs. Yes, Jobs was insufferable, but Isaacson seems more put off by his nastiness than the people whom Jobs mistreated. The book is longer than it needs to be. There is a lot of superfluous verbiage, redundancy, imprecision. One chapter, oddly, just showcases Jobs' musical tastes and his relationships with recording artists. Impressive access. I love the emphasis on design. But not well-written, sloppily edited, and too chiding at times. \\"Steve Jobs\\" is worthwhile for Apple fans and design fanatics, though.osophy of design, and this book goes into depth about the development of the Macintosh and Jobs' collaboration with designer Jony Ive from the iMac forward.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a newbie as far as Scifi/fantasy go, and now after reading all five books in this series, I am going to read more of the genre.  Hopefully book 6 will be out soon.  Great sub plots, intrigue, and the author really keeps you guessing.  No one is safe!
0385472951|5.0|I ordered this last minute and it was here in no time! Great service! Book was in great condition and exactly what I needed.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Fast and quick delivery. I would have preferred it in Blu-Ray but it is just as good. I hope to enjoy this for years to come. Thanks for the great service.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Very good CD.  I love Amy's strong rendition of the old tunes.  I was saddened as I listened to the CD, knowing that I will never have the opportunity to see a live Amy Winehouse concert.  Amy was such a talented gal.  She will be missed by her fans forever.
1419701533|5.0|UPDATE: APRIL 2015  I have purchased this set 4 more times for my other nephews. EVERYONE LOVES DIARY OF A WIMPY KID! For, some of my nephews this is the only thing that got them reading! My own littler kids constantly steal these from my eldest to read & peruse… So needless to say I will probably buy this 2-3 more times!  --------------------------------------------------------------- My daughter (10) loves this series! So, does my nephew (10) & niece (13). We have all the books (including the do it your self's), shirts, figures, audio.  When my sister told me my nephew had to borrow the books from his sister when he wanted to read them (and she didn't like to!). I knew I had to get them! (I also purchased cabin fever for them all!) He LOVED them & is always reading!  As pre-Christmas gifts I got them all books. She said that I had all her children loving to read! (She had told me several weeks before, her kids didn't really like reading!).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and will keep on giving you ways to unlock new games for you app and is well created.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This program can stream high quality graphics from my gaming PC to my kindle and my laptop!  I'm actually super impressed!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I ordered Harry Potter and the Prision of Azkabandonon January 8 and got it on the 10th. Fast Deliverey. Seems to be in condition decribed. Seems not to skip even though I have not finished it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The best thing the song of fire and ice has going for it is an incredibly talented writer. The style, depth, and originality leads to writing of such unusually high caliber that I would call it art.  George Martin creates such an ambitious setting and so far has proved to be able to handle it.  Reading this serious has been a rare treat.  Of course, there are always a few problems.  First and foremost is a lack of resolution.  Each chapter is told through one of a rambling number of characters who each focus on part of an intersecting plot. This a fresh delivery system but eventually you realize that every damn one is a psuedo cliffhanger and you wont know what happened until who knows how many other cliffhangers.  The books themselves are slightly troublesome in that they seem to be perpetually raising more questions than they answer.  I cannot detract from my rating for this series because of this issue because someday the whole series will be out and you wont have to worry about waiting.
0062082353|1.0|This guy is no hero.  The book is misleading and full of unproven accounts.  Including his admitted sucker-punching of former SEAL and Governor Jesse Ventura (Kyle then running away, like a coward) and the fact that Ventura says it never happened.<br /><br />This book is nothing but a lot of nationalistic flag waving with no actual substance.  Being a long-range shooter myself, I would even question some of the (supposed) shots said to have been taken.<br /><br />Don't bother with this book.  You'd be better off reading fiction from Clancy.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great product. Picked it up as a free app of the day, but after using would definitely pay for it. Set it  up on the private wifi network and mobile via port forwarding router without any problems. Simple to use and set up. Uses password on front and back end for security. It appears based on timing that no encryption is used. Would be a little apprehensive on public networks, then again I don't ever use them.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its an okay game but to unlock games gets kind of pricey. a lot of the games are really fun and it has a huge variety
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! it is all I could wish for! The only thing I think needed to be changed is...  NOTHING!
0446547654|5.0|the order unexpectedly arrived on time and I'm it enjoying even more :) because it's in good condition and ofcourse, because it's another of Nicholas Sparks great made books. Looking forward o ordering some more in the nearest future.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good job, do the review to earn pts but not bad, some games expensive in terms of points I think so
1416583432|5.0|I read this book after reading Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You A Better Friend to Your Pet by John Bradshaw, which I believe uses the same experiments. But I wish I bought this one first because I think Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know gives some context to the topic by describing the authors personal experience prior to research. I enjoyed reading it, and would highly recommend it.<br /><br />P.S. Some of those other reviews....come off \\"picky\\" to me, almost like they were looking for something. I'm not sure the writer wrote these books for \\"you\\". But the book is excellent in pulling together experience/experiment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is a Bible. and it is a good Bible with lots of different versions and I like to use it.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I have spent more than an hour trying to download this game, but each time there is an error in purchasing the free app. Would like to play. but can not download it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Time Killer is the only way to really describe this app. Ill probably never play any of these games again after I've beaten them.
0385523904|5.0|Gripping stories of individual North Koreans who defected.  A compelling account that gives insight into communism and the humanity it effects.  For me, this book was an emotional and intellectual journey that l hope left me a better person with more compassion for the spiritual and economic needs of this country.<br /><br />I wish the story had a perfect ending, but that isn't reality.  The author's last sentence sums it up well, \\"I can only excuse myself for leaving the story incomplete because the people in it, like Korea itself, remain works in progress.\\"  So are we all!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good for a free app but not a big fan of the credits to open up levels. most games take less than a minute.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I like this app but I only gave it four stars because I get tired of playing it sometimes even before I pass the game.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|This movie had no excitement. You could predict the whole plot from beginning to end. It was produced from using other movie ideas of the same nature. Don't waste your money.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Great CD. Tony Bennett is timeless. And, he can sing with anyone. His initial Duets and great and he has continued that long standing tradition with this new CD. A great mix of new talent with a timeless master.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app keeps me grounded! Great plans to fit any place your are in your life. Helps to bring me closer to.God.
B000OW77UU|5.0|Pursuit of Happiness   There are so many movies about a man battling against the odds and becoming a hero. Frankly, those movies are the kinds that usually are corny. That is one of many things that make The Pursuit of Happiness so amazing. With a fantastic cast including Will Smith, his son Jaden, and Thadie Newton there isn't too much to complain about when it comes to the acting in the movie. The single best  part of the movie though, is that the spectacular plot, you would have thought was created by a person, actually happened. The movie shows the horrible obstacles the main character, Chris Gardner, had to go through. For instance, the scene when Chris and his son Christopher have nowhere to go for the night so they are forced to lock themselves in the subway bathroom. But, the optimistic personality of Chris allows him to convert such a horrific situation into a fun and creative place, as he pretends with his son that they are actually in the time of the dinosaurs. The way Will Smith does this scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie to follow.   There are many other great things about this movie besides the plot and acting. This movie will satisfy young children, adults, and elderly people so much that there is no age range that would respectfully capture the unique leeway this movie allows when it comes to various ages. Also, this movie is perfect for the person who loves a heroic, inspiring movie or even the person who enjoys a sad, depressing movie as well. There is just too much good to say about this movie.    This movie is so inspiring. It portrays for the viewer that there is always hope. In the movie, Chris Gardner had less than fifty dollars on more the one occasion and still works hard, uses his mind, and conserves as much money as he can. An example of his quick thinking is shown in a very powerful scene taking place in a taxi with the boss of the company Chris is trying to work for. He has about ten minutes to impress the boss by finishing aRubik's cube he has been working on since the beginning of the movie when Christopher Jr. gets it as a present. He finishes it in the nick of time with about 10 seconds to spare. This scene showed the devotion Chris had to everything he set out to do. The story depicted in this movie was spot on and I hope that this movie generates much success as I enjoyed it so much.
0765365278|5.0|A future classic along with Mistborn #1.  A well developed world that is easy to understand AND appreciate.  A straight forward writing style reminiscent of Dune, A Game of Thrones, and Wizard's First Rule (but not any of their sequels)  --------  I prefer characters to plot  I like an economic use of words that clearly describe.  I like playful banter, and complicated actors.  I don't like a page of room description for a ½ page of plot  I don't like having to work to figure out what is going on.  I don't like \\"literature\\"  I don't like using repetition as emphasis.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|VERY HAPPY AND PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE OF THE AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories (Black) by AmazonBasics   IT MEETS ALL MY NEEDS.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The movie basically had a dumb premise but contained a lot of action and was entertaining. Kind-of a Sci-Fi comedy...
B004FS1TLM|5.0|Excellent CD. Buble is a throwback to Frank Sinatra and that era and does a great job on this CD. Highly recommended.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|Decent movie! Little too much of Ken Hong naked.  Funny, not as good as the first but is a sequal ever?!  Still worth buying and watching!
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is like a great book that is about 10 chapters too short. It was sooo fun and challenging but as other reviews said, it is way too short. They really need an update with more chapters or a sequel ir something. Then it would definately get 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Very fun. but some of the controls aren't great. There is a lag on some of the games. and the touch location isn't always accurate.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this was free on December 27 2011, but worth the money so buy it. great for wastin time, when your bored, and when your supposed to be doing your homework!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I initially went back and forth between this case and the CaseCrown Bold Standby Case.  I too allowed the bad reviews to momentarily cloud my judgement and I almost did not order this particular case.  I can't tell you how glad I am that my willingness to take a gamble (and the fact that the other case didn't come in pink) succeeded in presenting me with a truly awesome product!  After delicately handling my Kindle Fire for a week, I finally received this case in the mail (via UPS, 2 days later than expected due to mishandling on their part).  The back of the case was a deep, vibrant pink and looks incredibly sharp with the black cover.  Originally I was looking for a entirely pink one but I have to say that I quite like the two tone look of this case. As far as the fit, it fits like a glove.  There are no hard or rough edges like other reviewers mentioned and I'm not sure how there would be when the exterior is rubberized?!  I like how the case grips the corners and sides and does not infringe on the actual screen. One of the things that turned me off about alot of the other Kindle cases were the black elastic straps that went over the corners. In my opinion it gave it a cheap look and also made me wonder how long those straps would really last before either breaking or stretching out. Another feature of the case is the stand and I have to admit I haven't spent alot of time with the Kindle stand up, but I have tried it a few times and it appears to be pretty stable.  For those considering an attractive, durable, decently-priced case, you will not be disappointed.  Yes there are some bad reviews but if you look at the number of 4 and 5 star ratings, they far outweigh the number of 1 and 2 star ratings. These days it's hard to find any one thing that someone out there hasn't found some reason to complain about. However I've had good luck so far on Amazon ordering anything that averaged at least a 4 star rating (which this does).  I only paid $29.99 for this but evenif I had paid $10 more I would not be upset about it.  It's well worth it!
B00511PTWM|5.0|The Item that order is great , I will order from this company again ,very honorest ,and they keep the add honorest. they can be trusted
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The author is just amazing! You must read this!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Season Two isn't as great as the first season and my all time favorite is the fourth but the entire series is a great find and the second series even stands well on its' own.  Worth it to complete your collection; besides, who doesn't blame Rory for being infatuated with Jess.  Lorelai gets more of her own style; Emily and Richard become more complex and Rory continues to be fun to watch!
B000MAH5O2|3.0|I read this long after the fact. It's a pretty fair book, but with all the ensuing disappointments of his administration, it doesn't speak well for his \\"audacity.\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I thought this was an amazing app for my cell phone, and yet its better on my kindle!  Great job!
B0019VTKIM|5.0|I was so happy to find this movie brand new and reasonably priced!  I have been wanting to see it again for a long time.  It was one of my favorite movies when it first came out and now I own it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this program. easy to use and having different versions of the Bible is great. I am following a devotional and it has such good materials. using this on Kindle Fire.
1594744475|5.0|I love that there are pictures and recipes on the same page. This makes it easier to make a comparison of what your end product should look like. The pictures are fun and cute to look at, and the set up ideas are very descriptive. Would make a fun lunch for any kid, even picky eaters. Even my teenage kids want me to make them bento's for lunch! I would recommend this to anyone who has a tough kid to feed or kids who are not so into school lunches. It even makes it clear that you don't have to spend a fortune to make these, most of it is stuff we all keep in our pantries!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing. it gives you multiple games to start with and you can buy new games for free!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This DVD was selling at a GREAT price so I was very satisfied with that. The shipment was speedy and worry-free.  This was an overall great experience.
0446563048|5.0|This book changed my company. I had our HR director read this book and our company culture is now undergoing massive changes. I would highly recommend this book especially if your company is starting to mirror Office Space...Thanks Tony for sharing your story!
B00007KWHG|3.0|I ordered this CD because unable to locate it in any store.  Due to popularity of Jersey Boys, this group has florished.  Delivery was on time--the only complaint is that the case was cracked in a few places. Possibly packing with bubble wrap might have alleviated this problem.  Due to being a gift I had to find another CD case.
0553582038|2.0|I will keep this brief. Don't waste your time reading this fourth book. It is horrible. To be more descriptive, it is dead boring. After looking at the reviews for the fifth book, I will not be wasting my money or time on it. It appears that book 5 rivals the drivel of Feast for Crows. So sad. The first three books were phenomenal, one of the best series I had ever read. It seems the author is trying to squeeze as much money out of this series as he can by droning on for hours with little or no forward progression in the story line. Such a shame. It had the potential to be a great classic.
B005O64VH8|5.0|Winter Poem is Secret Garden's latest release, and well worth the wait. There are three songs with lyrics, the rest are instrumental. If one removes the lyric-song about Mary and Baby Jesus, this is music that can be listened to all year long because it is not your typical holiday music.  The rhythm of the entire album is restful, like what winter time should be. It helps one's mind relax from the rush of life, and brings about a sense of timelessness. The simplicity of this album is reminiscent of Secret Garden's earlier albums (Songs from a Secret Garden and Earthsongs), lulling one's heart to that magical place, a Secret Garden.  Fans of Secret Garden in general, and those who prefer the early works of the duo, will find this album to be a satisfying retreat.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great little short mini games to play and pass some time. or good for young kids to play. not to hard to play.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I traded in my Targus after it started to rip. Ended up getting a credit and bought another Targus backpack only to find that the construction was horrible. Ended up selling that backpack to put towards this Thule Backpack. So far, I've had no regrets. This backpack fits my 17' HP laptop like a glove with plenty of extra room for other gadgets. There is ample padding but is also very compact.<br /><br />Since I use the backpack quite a bit for commuting, paying a bit extra for quality is well worth it. I've actually gotten compliments from it (as it looks quite sexy)<br />There's a nice protective area for sunglasses in the top and it has an expandable pouch that can be synched down to hold newspapers and jackets. Additionally, the zippers thick and well constructed.<br /><br />Mahalos Thule - My new favorite backpack!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is cool. you have to play to win points to unlock all the games. Some of the games I have never seen before and they are fun. Great FREE app.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have had other solitaire versions on my cell but have not found them to work that well.  This one is loaded on my Kindel, and.is a pleasure to use.  If it will work on my cell this well, I will love it.
0525478817|5.0|Great books, or any form of a great story (for that matter) can make you cry and laugh. One that surpasses this level of greatness can make you laugh while you're crying, or vice versa. The Fault In Our Stars is that kind of book.  There was never a doubt in my mind about whether I'd like this book. I mean, this is John freaking Green (although I'm pretty sure that isn't actually his middle name). Plus, Paper Towns is my favorite book (ever). So when my copy arrived yesterday, I dropped my book bag by the door, forgetting the review book that I was so close to finishing, or the homework assignments I had, because I needed to know just HOW good The Fault In Our Stars was.  Let me tell you. It. Is. Brilliant. Paper Towns is still my favorite book from John Green (and my favorite in general), but this is his best book yet. He has these characters that you have to love, whether it's because of their clever observations of life, or the way they handle their day to day living with having to be declared or see as: THAT cancer girl or guy. As though that is all they will ever be remembered for (if at all). And this type of life or story would be terribly depressing if it weren't for the quirky, sarcastic wit that almost every character in some form or fashion seems to have. This is why I could start laughing in the middle of my tear fest, or randomly start crying in the middle of a laughing fit.  And the thing is, there are obvious signs that show when I know a book is excellent. When I'm reading this kind of book, all the situations and problems I have momentarily fall away. And for that day or two, there's a type of peace. Oh yea, and I either hug the book to my chest and smile a lot, or I have to make a note of all the awesome quotes I have to return to as soon as I finish the book.  There's a lot more to be said about this book, or how it makes me feel. Like how these characters are the most perfect imperfect characters I've ever met, or that I might (also) have fallenfor Augustus. But that's not the point, because I've already read it, and it has made a huge mark (not a scar) in my life. The point is that YOU need to read it. No book is for everyone, but I have no doubt that this one will be enjoyed by a multitude.  Additional note: I loved the book, but here are three distinctive things (other than the characters) that I really loved  -  The parts that were (clearly) inspired by The Great Gatsby  -  The poetry  -  An Imperial Affliction (which needs to be made into a real book... I'm just sayin

145162445X|5.0|Krauss' book addresses major comological questions, and as a by-product also the question of how the universe could have been created without God.<br /><br />The Big Bang occurred about 13.72 billion years ago (temperature was 10 billion Kelvin at the time), and the universe is till expanding. Our galaxy is one of about 400 billion. Hubble's Law (1929) found a linear relationship between recessional velocity and galaxy distance - distant galaxies are moving away at faster velocities. When a star explodes, over the course of a month or so it shines with a brightness of 10 billion stars, and is the brightest phenomena in the universe, is referred to as a 'standard star,'and used to estimate the speed of recession. An exploding star occurs about once every 100 years within each galaxy. Only the lightest elements (hydrogen, deuterium - heavy hydrogen, helium, and lithium) were made in the Big Bang - the rest were formed via fusion in the stars. About 200 million stars have exploded to date.<br /><br />A circle about the size of a dime made at arm's length and examined by one of today's larger telescopes would contain about 100,000 galaxies; the viewer would see about 3 exploding stars/night. (I think his talk on U-tube stated '10.') Astronomers estimate that galaxies are moving at about 70 km/second - about 151,000 mph. Within about 2 trillion years these accelerating galaxies will reach the speed of light and no longer be visible. The fact that they're accelerating proves that 'empty space' contains vast amounts of dark energy.<br /><br />Starlight was observed to curve around the Sun during a 1919 solar eclipse, by exactly the amount predicted by Einstein in his theory of general relativity.<br /><br />The universe could be of three types - closed (would allow a person who looked far enough in one direction to see the back of his head), flat, or open. Author Krauss believes the universe is flat, and that the evidence that the universe arose from nothing is the most compelling.<br /><br />As stated in my review title, 'A Universe from Nothing' is no easy read. I'm going to read it again, especially the latter part. Listening to his U-tube presentation on the same topic can also help., 'A Universe from Nothing' is no easy read. I'm going to read it again, especially the latter part. Listening to his U-tube presentation on the same topic can also help.

B004SVM7BW|4.0|while this app sometimes cannot open large files (only once in a while as I am reading mostly scientific journal articles), when it does the highlight, freehand, and note features are great. while its not Goodreader (iPad  app), its the best android annotation app.-

B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's a great game! This is the only game that I have on my Kindle Fire, and it keeps me entertained for hours. I got this game a week ago and I still haven't come close to beating it! I recommend this game to everyone!
6305428042|5.0|A great movie for the little one's.  My grandson (5years) will watch this everyday if you let him!  Up there with the great ones in entertaining children and adults.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|many options of bibles, reading plans, and other features makes this app very useful. ability to download many of the bibles is nice for offline use.
B006O5YHUY|1.0|I wanted to like this movie. But every cliche was here in the first five minutes. I wanted to be brought into the love of the sport, as in \\"Rocky\\" or even the \\"Wrestler.\\" please, your best bet is to watch a documentary on Rocky Marciano, which can be uploaded with the director's cut for three bucks. It was a much better movie! what's WITH movies today? are we all so stupid that any garbage they throw at us is enough as long as SOME of it sticks to the wall--or someone lies for their own purposes and TELLS us how great their movie is??? I also was to say that the female vocalist in the promo was irrelevant and it sounded either off or dated already. It didn't have anything to do with the movie. Very incongruous.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|This cover works perfectly for my Kindle Fire. It's exactly what I was expecting when I ordered it. Other reviews say that it doesn't fit the Fire well, but that has not been my experience. Like a pair of new shoes, you have to give it time (&lt;1-2 days) to \\"break in.\\"<br /><br />The only thing I wish it had was a way of propping up my Kindle Fire on it's own. Amazon has other covers like that, but they're not as fashionable or attractive as this one.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this cover!

B0002KVULG|5.0|Gerard Butler in [[ASIN:B00003CXSD Dracula 2000]] runs a close 2nd (his role is much smaller), but Frank Langella is still the hottest vampire of all time. His voice, his movements, even the way his eyes flicker - it all adds to the effect. He grabs your attention from the first time he sweeps into the room, whips off his cloak, and says, \\"Good evening.\\" Yes, they do switch Mina and Lucy around, but most Dracula films don't follow the book exactly. Kate Nelligan is beautiful as Dracula's feisty love interest. Renfield is creepy.  Lawrence Olivier makes a great Van Helsing. The only one I didn't like was Jonathan, probably because he was such a wimp compared to Dracula.  Scenes in the asylum seem very realistic. The love scene is a bit hokey, but who cares? The music is still gorgeous. Quality of the DVD is good, but the picture is a bit dark when compared to VHS. You can compensate for this with your tv controls. Don't miss this highly underrated version of Dracula!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome game. I love it. Sweet. Fun Addicting Interactive Awesome Amazing Cool Fun Fun Fun Cool Cool Cool Cool Cool
B006JPS1OM|5.0|this game keeps your interest as you follow a story and it is suspenseful.  I will buy the full version.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I have read every self help book ever written (ok, that's a slight exaggeration, but you get my point) trying to figure out why I can't conquer my weight /food issues.  This is truly the first book that gives answers that not only make sense but are easily implemented. It isn't specifically about weight loss, though she does use that as an example of how people try but fail and blame it on a lack of will power. For the first time I understand how the brain works and how and what will power really is.  No psychobabble about \\"self sabotage,\\" or your childhood, no spiritual guidance (not that there's anything wrong with spiritual solutions).  Already I have stopped rewarding myself for being \\"good,\\" which I have always done in the past.  Her writing is breezy and easy to u derstand even when she is explaining very complex subjects, like the parts of the brain, and what part does what.  Why did the sales of Big Macs increase at MacDonalds when they added salads to the menu?  The answer is here and it will surprise you. I can't say enough about the impact this book has had on me.  Whatever you are struggling  with, stopping smoking, curbing your spending habits, losing weight, this book will help you to understand will power and provides many tools and insights that are invaluable.  This is a game changer for me, I'd give 10 stars if I could.

1400069181|4.0|*  What I found most valuable in Blake's book were the \\"snapshots\\" of various firms' strategies for building business models that incorporated \\"giving something back\\" from the get-go [of the firm being started].  And, of course, he goes into quite a bit of depth about how his firm, Tom's, was conceived from the ground up as a \\"kinder-gentler\\" for-profit firm AND how that vision has been executed and nurtured over the years.  The only real knock I have on the book, and maybe this can be fixed in later editions should Blake have such an inclination, is that the book's examples are filled with touchy-feely types of businesses and he sems to have overlooked the \\"bread and butter\\" businesses that are the core of everyday life - IOW, don't expect a lot if you are the butcher, the baker, or the candlestick maker. [or freelance mechanic or owner of a lawncare service etc.etc.etc.]  BOTTOM LINE: Very worthwhile; especially if you are an entrepreneur who wants to \\"Start Something That Matters\\"!

B004XGN8W4|5.0|Ive had the G155 for about 4 months now. I have played through several games in that length of time. At first glance the hard shell appears to be rigid enough to provide decent protection to both the screen and the console. I have a 360 Slim which fits nicely into the housing and is snugged down nicely by the velcro straps. Heat displacement seem to work just as well as it does when the console is on a shelf. When I first turned the screen on I noticed that like several others have stated the screen does tend to be a little on the sharp side, although not enough that it causes a problem. The gloss over the screen can make reflections a problem if you have a bright backdrop behind you. The 720p resolution makes for a nice picture during gameplay and almost no blurring. Finally the two included bags are large enough for me to fit all the cables I need which include the console power cable (including the large power pack), the power cable for the screen, plug-n-play controller charger, a small extension cord, and one xbox 360 controller with an extra power pack & spare pair of batteries. There is enough room between the console and the screen to place two games in their respective boxes. All in all a great product for the money.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|There are many drawbacks to having Tom Cruise as your leading man.  There's that scary and unsettling \\"private\\" life that he leads, and he is short, forcing you to cast actors who can appear not so short (not an easy task).  But there's one thing that redeems it all:  he has tremendous screen presence.  Having been a superstar for almost thirty years, he's effortlessly charismatic on the big screen, and it's his confidence and self-assuredness that propels this film -- otherwise a haphazardly concocted spy thriller -- forward.  Yes, the action sequences look daring and creative, but they only hold because of Cruise's magnetic pull.  Put in Matt Damon in the same role, and the movie would just fall apart.

I have never worked for Apple, but I grew up in the years Jobs did and can associate with the story that Isaacson has crafted so well. I once had a boss that had the same passionate intensity about products, and all the engineers that worked for him were loyal followers, however his peculiarities stretched their belief. Steve Jobs - a very hard man to work with, but his legacy is lasting and widely appreciated.

B0059XTTXC|5.0|This is a movie that is essentially a time warp.  We are warped back into the seventies, when film was more grainy, the camera was actually steady, actors had substance, movies actually had a story to tell, and the audience was patient and intelligent.    By the standards of contemporary movie-making, when the first five minutes is usually an appetizer action sequence with a lot of explosions, this novel takes a really long time to get started, and the conflict slowly unfolds.  Gary Oldman does an excellent job of playing the understated George Smiley, who must uncover a Russian mole within the leadership circle of British intelligence while battling old age/insignificance and the loss of the love of his life.  George Smiley is the unlikeliest of all action heroes, and this spy thriller the opposite of James Bond.  It doesn't have the epic scale and consequence of \\"The Good Shepherd,\\" which was a great spy thriller in its own right.  But \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" does work, and is a rare breed of film:  a movie that stays loyal to the book while transforming onto the big screen.    What ultimately makes it work is the director's steady hand, his willingness and courage to test the audience's patience as he slowly builds up the plot, just as George Smiley patiently built his strategy to track down the Russian mole.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because although it is a classic romantic comedy in many ways, it has a bit more sophistication, quirkiness, and edge to it than most. The writing is sharp, and the cast is excellent. It centers around Julianne Moore and Steve Carroll as a long-married couple for whom the flame has died. She has a brief affair and asks for a divorce, and this plunges Carroll's character (Cal) into his own search for a new persona. Ryan Gosling is fantastic as a younger womanizer who tutors Steve Carroll in seduction, but then is himself changed by a relationship with Emma Stone's character.<br /><br />The movie is somewhat predictable, although it does have some twists that surprised me. It gets a little cliche in the way it resolves everything in the end, but I didn't mind that because the by then I was invested in the characters. I think the standout here is Ryan Gosling who is believable, touching, and sexy in his role. A good couple's movie!
B0068RHSZO|4.0|I've seen \\"Dream House\\" a couple of times, and thought it was a very good movie, despite all the bad reviews I've read. I agree with only one review so far, from geeksofdoom.com: \\"a distorting and turning journey of mind-bending proportions, taking elements of...horror fiction and re-energizing them as 21st century psychological thriller...admirable performances [Craig and Weisz]....\\"  \\"Yes, the plot is disorienting at times - but this is completely by design. While the audience is looking in a hundred distinct places to get a feel for where the movie is going, there are numerous elements hidden in plain sight that don't bubble to the surface until they're needed. The craftsmanship is the highlight and strongest facet of `Dream House', and make for a thrilling first viewing experience.\\"  I think there are many subtle hints that a great many viewers probably won't understand until they've seen the movie a second or third time. \\"...while it is not perfect, it sure is a hell of a lot of fun being along for the ride.\\"  The reviewer purposely did not see the trailers because of reports they gave away important plot elements. I did see the trailers, and I'm insulted that they gave away so much.  No wonder the actors and director refused to participate in promoting the film. The studio, Morgan Creek films, must think we viewers are really stupid, that we won't pay to see a film unless we're told all the good stuff in the trailers.  Also, it makes me wonder what plot elements they removed in their quest to satisfy the US rating people to bring it from R to PG.

B004132I20|5.0|The new Sherlock Holmes movies wish they were this good! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. BBC struck gold with the casting. Cumberbatch is absolutely perfect, as is Freeman. The show is incredibly well written and the dialog is often sharp and very witty. Sherlock will often leave your head spinning with his 100mph deductions on pretty much everything.   But the best thing about Sherlock is, of course, the mystery. It's always an awesome part of the show when Sherlock finally reveals that what he's suspected all along is exactly what's really been going on. Cumberbatch pulls this role off masterfully. It's no wonder he's getting all kinds of offers in big movies now.  Amazing show! Watch it now!!!

1595826971|4.0|When I saw the price of the book on Amazon I was so excited to buy the book I didn't think twice that it might be too good to be true. I haven't had issues with buying books from Amazon in the past and it's not something too serious. The book was in good condition the only problem was the paper bindings are loose on the first ten or so pages in the front and a few in the back. Which was disappointing because over time the pages, if not careful, could come apart. Had the description on the website mentioned the loose page bindings I would have been okay with the condition of my order. I saw the book before at my local comic book store and it didn't have that issue.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I watched West Wing when it was aired 10 years ago.  It was perhaps one the last great network series.  I had forgotten how good it was until I watched a single episode recently, and I was reminded of the fast-paced dialog, the intelligent but quirky roles, and the overall production quality.    It is decidedly Democratic in its political views - closed Republicans will hate this show.  Of interest is how the series portrays partisan politics as a force that forever underscores best intentions.  The shows writers cater to a more intellectual audience that do not need to be spoon fed every detail, and true to real life, the good guys do not always win.    After 10 years, the essential focus remains relevant and engaging.

030788743X|2.0|I'm a geek and I think the 80s were pretty rad.  I dig 80s movies, music, games, etc.  You'd think a book like this would be perfect for me.  It was recommended by Penny Arcade's Mike Krahulik and it even has a sweet blurb from John Scalzi praising it on the jacket.  How could I possibly go wrong with Ready Player One?  Easily.    It started off great.  While people escaping their bleak future through use of technology is nothing new to sci-fi at all, I really loved the idea of people competing in a massive easter egg hunt filled with 80s references.  The first glaring problem, however, was that the protagonist is the most intolerable character I've ever met.  I hoped for some kind of growth or escape from not only his immaturity but lack of self awareness.  Another review on here broke geeks down into separate categories: those who are generally cool people to be around, and the sort of irritating, self righteous know-it-all that is telling the story here.  I'm referring to the protagonist of course, so it's not a direct shot at Ernest Cline, however the main character does come off as a bit of a Mary Sue.  The lead, Wade, isn't perfect. In fact, he describes himself as an overweight stereotypical nerd, but within the realm of geekdom he knows all.  This proves to be a vehicle for shameless pandering and listless references.  I figure this has a lot to do with the praise the book is receiving.  It tosses out a lot of 80s geek references both well known and obscure.  I can appreciate that but it comes off as a bit much.  The worst part is that doesn't even scratch the surface.  It's such a huge problem with the book that is consistent from start to finish.  \\"Finish\\" for me, admittedly, was only halfway through the book.  Maybe it's not fair to review this so harshly if I didn't finish but I couldn't bring myself to get through the last half, and from those I know who have read it, they say it doesn't get any better.  **BIG SPOILER ALERT** - When he is offered a certain choice he is told his life is on the line, his aunt's trailer/his trailer park being shown to him via video, clear as day.  He calls their bluff all the while thinking \\"I am in my secret hideout, no WAY have they rigged THAT with explosives! I'm safe!\\".  They didn't bluff, trailer park goes boom, and he is shocked.  What?  They showed him the trailer park, not his van.  I mean it's plain as day.  This is straight up bad writing.  **END SPOILERS**  Ahem.  That's where I stopped reading.  After putting up with a grating narrator I would not want to be around in person for more than 5 minutes (and I have known a great deal of these sort in my time) I had to call it quits.  I was willing to forgive his personality for the sake of finding out \\"what happens next\\" but the plot took a nosedive halfway through.  It would be hard to convince me to go back, even with the accolades and praise it has received.  I can only imagine how the movie is going to turn out but I am leaning towards disappointing.

B0060ZJ74O|4.0|'Moneyball' underwent as many benching's and roster changes in the production stage as the Oakland A's did in their 2002 pursuit of a World Series as depicted in the film. In 2011, finally completed, `Moneyball' is a baseball movie that transcends just professional sports, but becomes a simile for determination, integrity, and life in general. This is a sports movie that elicits inspiration, not in the typical Rocky banality, but with reflective affinity that resonates with us all.  The film, based on true events, follows the small market Oakland Athletics' General Manager Billy Beane in his pursuit of a World Series with the lowest budget of any team in the league. When he is forced to gut his team after a successful season, he does so by hiring a new assistant to help him develop an entirely revolutionary concept of recruiting players based on number crunching methods. This new method derides classic scouting methods that were based on intuition and professional experience.  The film is unorthodox in that it uses the game of baseball and its players as a backdrop to what the general managers and scouts do behind the dugout in their little offices. While this film focuses on the cutthroat struggle of team management, its strength lies in the pitch perfect (pun intended) execution of the screenplay which resembles closely what 'The Social Network' did for all of its intricate computer vernacular and idioms. It is no coincidence that Aaron Sorkin was credited as a writer, making accessible all the dialogue involving player statistics and complex business transactions. This is a drama through and through, but the pacing is supplemented with understated humor, a subtle buddy complex between Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt, and some excellent shots of actual baseball (consisting of real game footage, and recreated scenes, equipped with slow motion and portrait like opaque backgrounds for epicness).  Inspiration is a key theme in most sports films because it is fundamentally inherent in the sporting world in general. Unfortunately for a lot idealistic films about (_insert sport here_), they tend to resort to cliché's about larger than life golden boys who defeat insurmountable odds to the delight of everyone around them. `Moneyball' succeeds in lifting the spirits by defying this rule. Billy Beane is, of course, painted in a way that's easy to root for, he's the ultimate underdog - but he pisses a lot of people off along the way. He is human to us because he makes decisions that have consequences; this is a film that isn't afraid to see the protagonists' worst case scenario materialized. This film unearths greatness due to excellent performances, succinct execution, and an exceptionally grounded story.   If I may resort to clichés myself, Bennett Miller's `Moneyball' is a definite winner. No...it's a home run!

0307592731|5.0|This book contains two major storylines interwoven, Cheryl's inner and outer journey. It takes place at a critical juncture in her life. It is engaging and well-written.  Here are her words from the prologue on the two journeys and her hope for them, \\" A world [the Pacific Coast Trail] I thought would both make me into the woman I knew I could become and turn me back into the girl I'd once been.\\"<br /><br />The outer journey follows her on the PCT from Southern CA to Washington State. The PCT is like the Appalachian Trail on the east coast, yet less traveled. In the summer of 1995 Cheryl hikes 1,100 mile along this trail. The inner journey is her healing and coming to terms with herself. Before she starts her hike, we know her loving mom has died of cancer, her marriage ended, her family falling apart, she is broke, and has been doing heroin. As she hikes the PCT more events and stories from her life and relationships are revealed.<br /><br />I'd describe this book as combination of memoir, light travelogue, self awareness book.  Travelogues by themselves I don't enjoy, yet this has enough details on where she was on her trip and how she did it (or shouldn't have)  that I found myself flipping back to the map in the front and using other references to see where she was along the path.  I also looked up some of the poems that she referenced.<br /><br />The details and how they are written brought the book to life, for example her personification of her backpack called monster, her toenail count, and how she describes her inner radio/repetitive/song voice as it gets monotonous and painful on the trail are believable. The people she meets along the trail, the interactions, the struggles, and triumphs are fascinating.  She writes about being with the \\"three young bucks\\" as, \\"Being in their company felt like a holiday.\\"  At one point I thought REI was sponsoring the book because of her almost cult like worshipping of them, until they failed her. The writing is direct, brutally honest, and concise and to the point, like her.<br /><br />I am in awe of her journey, inspired, and motivated by it. It's powerful and chilling, beautiful and uplifting.  It is one of the most unique and best books I've read in a long time. It was a book I was tempted to read fast in several sittings, however, I made myself slow down to enjoy the writing.<br /><br />As Cheryl ends her hike in Washington State the inner journey and book ended too. It wraps up all too fast and tidy in the end. I wanted to hear more about her life after and see some pictures from the trip. I did find a picture on her website with the backpack monster on. I hope for a Part II!  Thank you.and to the point, like her.  I am in awe of her journey, inspired, and motivated by it. It's powerful and chilling, beautiful and uplifting.

B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Don't like sports movies?  Me neither.  They're predictable; even the best of them (I'm thinking of THE FIGHTER) ultimately succumb to genre convictions.  Have no fear, however: MONEYBALL never truly does.  Because it's not a sports movie; it's a movie about sports movies, which also happens to be based on a true story of an underdog team that came up from the depths to take the industry by storm.<br /><br />Let me throw something out there, because it will become immediately transparent: with the exception of a hot girl in my high school geometry class, and Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, math and baseball are two of the most boring things in the world to me.  So when I tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed--and may even come to love--MONEYBALL, you'll get where I'm coming from.  Because it's a film about both.  It follows a general manager (Brad Pitt) who takes the advice of a novice scout (Jonah Hill) and decides to put together a team based not on money but on winning power, despite the resistance of his own scouts and managers.<br /><br />The film has an impressive pedigree behind it.  Director Bennett Miller (CAPOTE) has a sure hand; he knows how to create a scene and keep a story moving along.  The script comes from the likes of Steve Zaillan (everything from SCHINDLER'S LIST to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) and Aaron Sorkin (\\"The West Wing,\\" THE SOCIAL NETWORK), who both know how to craft character and story.  But this is really an actor's film, and the lead actor here is the film's anchor.  Brad Pitt gives an award-worthy performance: subtle, nuanced, not necessarily the thing that wins Oscars but that deserves to (and just might; let us hold our breath in anticipation...or not).  He's helped out with a tremendous supporting cast, most notably Jonah Hill, giving a surprisingly straight-laced (though still quietly humorous) performance, Kerris Dorsey (grossly underused as Beane's daughter), and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the resistant manager who tangles with Beane's forward-thinking policies.  They help flesh out a film that would have been an interesting story, but may have become a big of a drag.  Truly, watch this film for Pitt's performance; stay for Hill's; and relish in a true story that manages to defy genre stereotypes and is, ultimately, a refreshing \\"behind the scenes\\" sports film.inking policies.

There are several Bible versions to choose from and you can set up special programs if you want to only read certain portions, say Psalms or the New Testament for example, or if you want to accomplish a reading goal in a certain amount of time, say the Bible in a year or the New Testament in a month (maybe that choice was a little longer, I can't remember exactly).  I still don't even know all the things this app can do and just knowing that I can be challenged by it keeps me interested. This app is definitely worth having.

1594203059|5.0|[[ASIN:1594203059 Civilization: The West and the Rest]]. Even though the book was critisized by a Noble Prize winner, I think it is a fine work of historical assessment when the West went past the East in cultural development. All cultures the last 600 years did many bad things. His thesis is that despite those unimaginable things done among societies during those times......the West has moved past East in a very short time by rapidly excelling in: medicine, science, competition,rule of law,consumerism and the work ethic. And yet the stark difference in transformation between North America and South America during these periods showed to me the burden that they carried from the past to the new territories....culturally, morally and religiosly. I had a chance to study, work and build a family in the West and worked and developed relationsips in the East..even though we do Western practice in many aspects of our lives, we still adhere to long rituals and practices of the past. Real experiences have validated Ferguson's work!

0307593312|2.0|Finished Book 1. Not quite engrossing and shares many similarities with other Murakami books. Main female character is an assassin with a fondness for bald men (!!). Will take a break and get back to it in 2012.  Done with Book 2. Story seemed tighter but gradually gave way as well. Female characters seemed to be build from manga archetypes. There are some some lovely moments, such as a mini-story about the town of cats, but so much fluff to wade through with typical Murakami characters that are just full of longing. The two main characters pine for each other after a brief encounter when they were 10. Highly self-conscious writing, such as when characters talk about how a gun is used after it's introduced because of dear Chekov. Worst of all, only tangentially related to Orwell's 1984.  Book 3 was even more disappointing. The book now adds another viewpoint; a suspicious character who we are constantly reminded looks ugly and it not accepted in Japanese society. Also, the plot slows to a crawl, as both characters seem content to hideout. Plot threads are left dangling, and the prime focus is the supposed relationship between the two main characters, who held each other's hand briefly when they were 10.  I really wanted to like this book. Anybody who devotes their time to read such a huge tome would. In fact, there were interesting components; a doomsday cult led by a charismatic leader, a mysterious alternate Japan, shady gangster types, a matriarch determined to take revenge for the cause of abused women but Murakami drifts off to focus on the thin love affair between the two leads. There are wonderful moments, such as the story about a town of cats, or Tengo's Sundays wandering with his father to collect television subscription money, and bits of wonderful description, but those are few and far between. Instead what we get is some fairy tale about little people, and characters that are two-dimensional and quite unconvincing. Naturally, this being Murakami, thereare little snippets of information, often utterly unconnected to the main story, but placed just to hopefully keep the reader interested. (I imagine these segments being read by Stephen Fry on QI; it helps).  I wanted to know more about the cult and I thought they would play more of a part in Book 3, when the threads started to come together. But sadly, they stay apart, and the whole book just drifts off towards a cringe-inducing conclusion. Overall, a vast disappointment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I didn't go into this blind, I read that only certain games were unlocked and you'd have to earn coins to unlock the rest. It works nicely on my Kindle Fire, and I like a lot of the games.

Looking forward to any other books by this author.  Amazon is becoming a great resource for good books.  Preview chapters are better than going to the library.

The figure is sized perfectly for little toddler hands and the quality is superb. My little one has been playing with this for weeks and not a single scratch.

Also-- the Schleich animals all stand solidly. No wobbles so little ones can play without frustration. Fantastic, educational, and very fun toy!

0525478817|5.0|I've read a lot of books, but this is one of my all time favorites; that's not something I can say about very many books. I'll make it simple; I'm a fifteen year old teenage boy. When I usually read a book, I toss it aside and move on to the next one. And, like most teenage boys, I am not very emotional. At the end of this book, I cried. Not just a few tears either; I was full on bawling my eyes out. That's how good this book is. I promise you, unless you have a heart of stone, you will love this book.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Like \\"Green Lantern,\\" this film was one of the biggest flops of last summer and I frankly can't figure why (although since it was produced by Spielberg and Ron Howard, I am not about to lose any sleep crying over their financial loss.)  Basically the title says it all: a disparate group of cowboys, (led by amnesiac gunman Daniel Craig and hard-bitten ex-Army Colonel Harrison Ford,) outlaws and Indians attempt to rescue a group of various loved ones kidnapped by invading aliens.  The film is exciting whether as a science fiction fantasy or a traditional western with science fiction aspects.  I greatly enjoyed the film as a traditional western before the aliens even made an appearance.  I grew up loving westerns and still do.  Perhaps thats the reason this film tanked: today's young people just cannot relate to most westerns and stayed away in droves.  Thats my only explanation. The film has excellent performances from the two leads and a terrific supporting cast, great special effects and exciting action sequences.  What more could you ask?<br />The blu-ray includes an extended version of the film (15 minutes) which I watched.  I frankly did not remember what the new scenes were.  Theres the usual\\"making of\\" material (wherein most of the cast and producers fall all over themselves slobbering about the genius of the director, Jon Favreau.  Every \\"making of\\" segment on any DVD or blu-ray, whether the film is the biggest hit or biggest bomb, has one of these segments where the cast fall all over themselves proclaiming what a genius the director of the film is.  I guess every director today is the caliber of Hitchcock or John Ford.)  There are also very long interviews between Favreau and the cast and producers of the film. (I only watched the interview between him and Daniel Craig in its entirety.)<br />The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are excellent.  If you want an action-packed sci-fi. film thats a little different you could do way worse than this film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there is enough variety that you will never get bored. kindle fire can make the controls kind of tough, but that is fire problem, not game

B005HSG3TC|2.0|I got this as a gift when I received my Kindle Fire. Personally I would have never bought this one on my own.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />It's very slim and light weight. It doesn't add much bulk to the Fire but still offers protection.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Dust Collector: The inside of the flap is felt. Problem? It picks up every bit of lint, dust, dog hair, or whatever it come in contact with. There are many other materials that would provide a soft surface without keeping a collection of every place you've been.<br /><br />Unstable: Unless you are on a flat and non-moving surface the cover is very unstable when the kindle is propped up in view mode. I guess the designers assume you would be sitting at the table to watch movies. However trying propping it up to watch in bed and good luck. Just don't move.<br /><br />Way Overpriced (and thus the 2 star rating): $40 bucks is ridiculous for this simple cover. $20 bucks or less might be reasonable. There are much more higher quality covers with much better functionality out there for less than 40 bucks.<br /><br />If you willing to spend this much money - then order the Incipio Amazon Kindle Fire KICKSTAND Case Cover. Just as sleek, better looking, and much better stand for viewing.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MYA77E/ref=oh_o02_s00_i00_details

He is informed of the social and environmental impacts and given insight into the major issues around the creation and ongoing operation of the aqueduct.<br /><br />*The Aqueduct (HD)-- The City of Los Angeles completed the 233-mile gravity-fed aqueduct from the Owens Valley in 1913, under the leadership of a self-taught engineer named William Mulholland. L.A. Department of Water and Power representatives along with Catherine Mulholland, granddaughter of the engineer, discuss the development of the aqueduct and its contribution to the growth of the nation's second-largest city.<br /><br />*The Aftermath (HD)-- For decades a large rural community was desiccated under the management of water rights by the City of Los Angeles over a vast area of the Owens Valley.  Legal victories beginning in the 1970's lead to successful reductions in environmental damages and the restoration of some natural habitats.  Historians, local ranchers and activists discuss the up-to-date impacts of the aqueduct and struggle to maintain a stable environment and community.<br /><br />*The River & Beyond (HD)-- Prior to the building of the first aqueduct a century ago Los Angeles relied solely on its own local water supply: the Los Angeles River and its aquifer.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to carry almost every version of the Bible around with me whereever I go.  I can simply click on the app and off I go.  I makes it easier to find references in the Bible when I need a verse quickly and it also makes it easier to keep up with the verses in our pastor's sermons.  I recently got a kindle fire and would love it if they would open the NIV for download again, that's the one I like the most and I cannot view it when I do not have Wi-Fi.
0142000655|5.0|This hard cover edition is an excellent collector's piece. Of all Steinbeck's works, this particular work stands apart as one of his best, along with, of course, his masterwork, The Grapes of Wrath.  The conflict between the two brothers raises fundamental questions about sin and human nature, and the mother, about morality.  I could read this book over and over and every time marvel at the craftsmanship and genius that went into writing it.

B004ECDNJU|3.0|Dragon Fire is a very simple game that becomes tedious within several minutes of gameplay. The replay value of this game is very limited. This is a game that needs improved graphics, additional levels and gameplay events as well.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This is by far my favorite book series of all time!! I read A LOT and I cannot tell you how many times I have recommended this to someone.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read that this wasnt a good book to read on a Kindle.  A good ol' fashion paperback is needed because the photos (supposedly) don't download.  Without giving away the whole thing, lets just say that the photos are really important to the story.  With all that being said, I greatly enjoyed this book.  It's a breathtaking story about the relationship between a grandfather and grandson.  Stories told over generations, but are they stories or the truth?  This book had so many twists and turns and ended up in a place I never expected to be.  I highly recommend this story.  I'll definitely read it again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  So convenient and the choice of versions is very nice.  I also like the daily programs offered and use the Joyce Meyers one.
B0000X61UU|4.0|I picked this up out of my roommates collection of work out videos she had never touched. I was feeling a little chubby and needed to get a little activity so I decided to start doing it since I didn't want to pay for a gym membership for the winter months. I did it mostly so I wouldn't gain any more weight and kind of out of boredom. Well, my roommate started noticing the results before I did. I was about a size 8 before I started and within about 1 1/2 months I was down to a 4. I kind of had to laugh at it. My roommate was a bit upset cos she couldn't believe it actually worked. Pretty funny. So it's alright in my opinion. It's not a real hard work out, but it keeps your heart rate up. That is the key I think.  I would suggest it to my friends.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|Originally, I wasn't expecting much from this game since it did not contain a way to advance to new stages or actually accomplish anything other than earning small achievements. After further gameplay I am surprised to say that Fruit Ninja is such a fun game, that it doesn't need those extra features. Classic, Arcade, and the new Zen mode are all fun ways to play the game as you complete accomplishments and slash fruits.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved this. I can't even describe it better than other reviewers have already done, but this book absolutely enchanted me. The prose seems stuffy at first and somewhere along the way becomes poetic and spellbinding.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|It might not sharpen my knives to professional levels, or quite as well as my old whetstone did, but for putting a quick edge on my blades this sharpener does a very good job. It feels a little awkward in my hand, possibly since my hands are a bit big, but all in all I am very satisfied with my purchase. I have a couple of knives that I purchased years ago that I haven't used since I lost my whetstone a while back, but those knives are back in use with a nice edge on them. It is pretty easy to get blades sharp enough to slice cleanly through the edge of a piece of paper, but not quite sharp enough to shave hair off my arm with it. If I can shave a patch off my fore-arm with my knife, I figure that is pretty sharp, so this thing is pretty close.

0385343175|5.0|Heloise Martin had the immense good fortune to grow up in the upscale Hotel Vendome on East 69th Street in New York City with her doting father, Hugues, a staff of workers who took the charming little girl under their wing, and all of the advantages that money could buy.  Even though her supermodel mother, Miriam Vale, ran off with a rock star and divorced her father when Heloise was only four years old, she has adjusted amazingly and loves her life with her father in the hotel. What little girl wouldn't enjoy getting her hair done in the hotel's salon, attending luxurious weddings and receptions that take place in the hotel's ballroom, and eating gourmet food ordered from the hotel restaurant and delivered by room service?  Heloise is an adorable, hardworking little girl who remains unspoiled despite all of her advantages. She walks the dog of an older hotel resident, does what she can to help the homeless, and fills in when and where she is needed at the hotel with no sense of entitlement or demands for preferential treatment.  As she grows up, Heloise knows that there's nothing she wants to do more than complete her education and run the Hotel Vendome alongside her father. As much as she hates to leave the hotel and her father and friends, she embraces the adventure of attending school in Switzerland where she rounds out her hospitality and hotel management education.  While Heloise is away, her father meets a beautiful and charming woman he'd like to share his life with. Unfortunately, he's not sure how to break the news to Heloise. Since her mother never played more than a marginal part in her life, Hugues found himself serving as both mother and father to his lovely daughter. Now he struggles with how to tell her that he's found love again. But Hugues isn't the only one with an interest in the opposite sex, and Heloise has her own romantic adventures as she matures.   No matter what tragedies and triumphs the two generations of Martins face, they know that they can always take refuge in the one place that opens them with warm and open arms: the Hotel Vendome.  Danielle Steel fans have come to expect a certain standard when reading the novels penned by their favorite author. When they pick up HOTEL VENDOME, they won't be disappointed. Steel has created a fairy tale world where happy endings are requisite, and warm and tender emotions prevail.   As they turn the pages of this novel with the exquisitely elegant cover, readers will enjoy taking refuge in the high-class world where movie stars, world leaders and other celebrities mingle with warm and friendly staff to create a well-rounded cast of characters who delight and entertain. Who wouldn't want to book a suite at the Hotel Vendome?  Reviewed by Amie Taylor

Fix compatibility issues and it gets 5 stars.  EDIT: I did get it to work on the Iconia Tab A100, but it has some bugs (subtitles don't work, other minor stuff). That bumps it up to 3 stars. Still needs fixes, it could be a 5 star game.

B000YAA68C|5.0|First, if you read the book (I did not), don't expect the movie to match this - here's the thing THEY NEVER DO, EVER. I read Stephen King books, watch some the movies, the movies are never as good as the books because a movie budget cannot match our imaginations. Secondly, if you know you don't like Swank or Butler - then just don't watch the movie to begin with, but don't watch it and then complain about how much you can't stand to watch them. This is a great movie - people are so used to the ending that they expect (ie Swank ending up with Connick) that they can't appreciate a movie that deviates from thier expectations. I didn't see that they had any chemistry to begin with anyway. I love him as a musician and actor, but thier characters had no spark together and this was apparent from the beginning, it was right that they didn't end up together. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is adorable, him and Swank go great together. I also find it funny that people will complain about how this movie \\"wasted thier time\\" etc, if so - why write a 3 page review about it? Isn't that wasting more time? Move on.
B00006674X|1.0|I have been a fan of Elvis Presley's music since the King hit like a bomb in the mid-1950s. I bought all his early 45s and then the LPs, and by now have collected the best CD masterings of all his good songs (not the movie filler).  Some of his movies were mildly entertaining fluff (Follow That Dream, Kid Galahad); some were talky bores (Wild in the Country, Love Me Tender, King Creole); and Blue Hawaii spawned a dozen copycat color travelogues with thin plots and often thinner songs. In many of his movies, it was obvious that the producers couldn't decide whether they were presenting an actor or a singer. Eventually, Elvis sank to making sitcom-level, low-budget dreck like Kissin' Cousins and Harum Scarum.  \\"Change of Habit\\" is perhaps Elvis' worst movie: a shallow, confused, cliché-ridden, cardboard attempt to be \\"relevant.\\" Virtually every scene is sickeningly bad, and that is coming from a lifelong admirer of Elvis Presley's talent.  I guess the movies made a lot of money, but overall they were a detriment to the man's career. Thirty-five years after his death, his star still shines bright, but it might have been brighter had he never made a single movie.

B005AAVFDQ|5.0|It took a while for the product to arrive, but once it did everything was in good shape (it shipped from the UK to Cali.) and just as described. The packaging was well  taken care of, and all the contents were protected very well.
B005DR64OQ|1.0|This is what a truly awful movie looks like:  \\"Give me the diamonds.\\"  \\"No.\\"  \\"Give me the money.\\"  \\"No.\\"  \\"Pretty please?\\"  \\"No.\\"  \\"I'll shoot her.\\"  \\"No.\\"  \\"Okay then, I'll shoot the other one.\\"  \\"No.\\"  \\"Okay then I'll stab you with this here syringe I just happened to bring with me on this break in.\\"  \\"No.\\"  \\"A[...]  Come on.  Pretty, pretty please?\\"  Of course this is all followed by and preceded by lots of screaming, yelling, f-bomb dropping & over acting.  That pretty much sums up the whole \\"Trespass\\" experience.  I just saved you and hour and a half....

0375507256|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading 'Cloud Atlas' because I read the fantastic reviews. When I bought it, the woman in the bookstore said \\"Oh, you'll like this - I think this is the best book I've read this year.\\" I couldn't have been more disappointed! This book was a real struggle to get through. It seemed to be more of an experiment in literary devices than something that was meant to be enjoyed. The idea of six linked stories covering different eras sounds really cool, but the actual content was pretty boring.   The first two stories are kind of slow, not very interesting. The third and fourth are a little more promising in the first half of the book, but by the end are too drawn-out to be engaging. The fifth and sixth are truly awful. The fifth story (the dystopian one) is really derivative of  pretty much everything else I've read in the genre, but doesn't add anything new or unique to the genre. It's just a weak imitation. The sixth one (set in Hawaii) is written to convey a speech pattern and was nearly impossible for me to read.   In the end, I found all the stories to be nothing more than tedious copies of existing stuff. Mitchell didn't add anything new, just jumbled a bunch of conventions together. The linking of the stories really was nothing more than little mentions here and there, nothing profound. The whole book added up to something extraordinarily pretentious with very little to actually say (certainly nothing original). Then Mitchell used a bunch of 'clever' literary tricks piled on top in an attempt to disguise this. If it's supposed to play with genres, I found it very conventional and really lacking in any joy or fun. Maybe it's more enjoyable if you really, really like literary devices.    This was a serious struggle to get through, and at the end all I felt was relief! I'm really baffled by all the great reviews - I thought this was pretty terrible and disappointing. 2/5
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ehh its ok its not addicting but its an ok game I like to play it in my spare time but I think some of the games are to hard and others to easy

B0054JZC6E|1.0|The games are chincy, the controls unresponsive, the ads difficult to avoid tapping.  Judging by the ad content this is targeted at teens who don't know any better.  There are plenty of ads on the net, no need to download an ap that delivers them directly.

1593083793|5.0|This book arrived on my table at a time when I was disgruntled and experiencing spiritual confusion. When I read the parable of the brahman who seeks enlightenment, then denies his ascetism, only to later find inner peace, I was so touched by Hesse's expression of spiritual perfection that I decided to forgive everyone and follow the path of the Dharma. Both by Gautama Buddha, the Perfect One, whose spiritual teachings Siddhartha ultimately denies, only to find peace by following his own spiritual path, I was inspired. Enlightenment is described as pure selflessness and working toward the well-being of all sentient beings. I have not achieved enlightenment, however, I have decided to follow the path of Dharma.

B0062NAX1U|4.0|Courageous<br /><br />From: Sherwood Pictures, Provident Films, Affirm Films, TriStar, and Sony Pictures<br /><br />I must admit, I wasn't a fan of any of the Sherwood Picture films before I watched Courageous.  While I thought Fireproof was a well made movie, I disagreed with most of the \\"morals\\" preached in the movie - okay, that sounds weird, but I am not going to type out all my thoughts on that subject right here and now, so that will have to do.<br /><br />I chose to watch Courageous for two reasons:<br /><br />A. I read the book and found it quite good.<br />B. I received a free copy to review (that is also why I chose to read the book.)<br /><br />This movie is about a group of cops who start off being \\"good enough\\" fathers, but later decide they want to do better.<br /><br />Who it is for:<br /><br />While this movie was made specifically for dads, I think it can be entertaining and uplifting to others as well.<br /><br />I didn't find the content too violent or mature, so I think that this movie should be appropriate for anyone over the age of 10 - when watched with a parent or other adult who would be willing to answer any questions they may have.<br /><br />Quality of the movie:<br /><br />I found that the quality of this movie and the acting were quite good. I especially thought the acting of the gang members was quite realistic.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />This movie shares the gospel message, along with other \\"biblical\\" messages in a quality film - while some would still call this \\"preachy\\", I think it will have a greater influence than lower quality Christian films.<br /><br />The story was interesting and easy to follow.<br /><br />This movie doesn't have anything big that I disagree with, like Fireproof did...<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />...However, I didn't agree with everything completely (but when do I ever agree with everything on a movie completely?)<br /><br />My Conclusion:<br /><br />This was actually a pretty good movie, for which I am happy.<br /><br />I give Courageous 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />I received this a screener copy of this dvd from Provident Films, free to review. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.are my own.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for many reasons. Super 8 centers around a group of kids in the late 70's filming a movie. However, after a major accident, the focus turns from filming their movie to trying to figure out what is going on in town. Things disappearing, animals acting strangely, and an outside presence entering town all let you know something strange is happening in the small quiet town of Lillian. During their movie-making process and investigation into the mystery, the group of friends becomes closer and even deal with issues that teenagers still face in the present. The young cast in the movie are all very talented. Joel Courtney leads the way (in his debut acting role no less!) as Joe Lamb, a teenager struggling to connect with his father in their single parent household. He also has to deal with his first crush and conflict with friends as he learns to become a leader and someone who can take charge in a difficult situation. His facial expressions are phenomenal as he displays a wide variety of feelings perfectly and is more than capable of delivering emotionally charged dialogue. Such a great first acting role, expect Joel Courtney to be acting for many years to come. Next is Elle Fanning, who plays the only girl (Alice Dainard)among the group of friends and who has troubles at home of her own. Look for an amazing scene between her and Joel in the middle of the movie where both showcase their emotional depth and may very well move you to tears. Riley Griffiths plays the bossy director of their film (Charles), yet is also capable of showing a more vulnerable side in Super 8 as well. Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, and Gabe Basso play the remaining 3 friends in the group (Cary, Preston,Martin)and each gets a chance to show off their comedic skills and add a lot of humor to the movie, especially Ryan. While the resolution to the movie (and the end of the mystery)may seem to come about suddenly, the message behind it is very meaningful and full of symbolism. Overall, a delightful movie
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I was very surprised at how entertaining this game is.keeps me busy for hours.  can hog beat the price either.
078322611X|5.0|Not only is this movie one of the greatest 'Baseball' movies, it is also a terrific movie for even those who are not sports fans. The main character in this movie, Ray, is a farmer who has never really done anything risky in his adult life. When this changes and he takes a leap of faith of sorts, the people in his town look at him with ridicule, but for the first time in his life, he feels he is involved in something truly meaningful. As he makes this 'journey', he encounters people who not only help him reflect upon the history of Baseball, but also the importance of family and having good values and beliefs. Ray also reflects on his troubled relationship with his now deceased father. At it's heart, this movie is about the power of reconciliation in relationships. Also, about how 'miracles' can happen when you set out to do something you firmly believe in. The acting is phenomenal and is at times dramatic and at times humorous. The three things listed in my title, to me, combine to form the greatest combination of things on this Earth and this movie has each of those things in abundance.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Daniel Craig (next to Sean Connery) is the best Bond yet... this movie was more realistic than some of the past Bond flicks. It wasn't fillied with ridiculious gadgets and silly villans.<br />The girls, once again, were up to the Bond standard, for sure.
B004ZEWP28|5.0|A fantastic album in which Moby distills himself down to what he is best at: striking emotional chords in the listener. The whole album plays up and down the emotional spectrum. 'The Day' is worth special note, but the album seals the deal with 'Stella Maris,' an instrumental piece that leaves me in an odd blend of melancholy and hopefulness each and every time I hear it.
1401233376|4.0|Let's be honest. Flashpoint is there to change the DC Universe and usher in the new 52.  While others will see this only as a cheap shot from DC to attract new customers (which it most certainly was), I believe that it's the best way to start a new continuity that they could have possibly come up with.   Geoff Johns' writing is above average for monthly comics, and I would recommend almost anything of his. This is a major lead-in story for what will probably be a giant event in the new DCU. Read it and enjoy it for what it is!

0375703764|5.0|I remember reading this book one night when I was by myself--my wife had gone out for the evening. I got so freaked out that I had to stop reading. Much of the terror revolves around the dark areas of a house. Even after I stopped reading, I was so scared that I went around the house and turned on EVERY SINGLE LIGHT. It was too quiet, so I turned on the radio to a news station. Then I left the house and went out to our little cottage in the backyard, turned on all the lights in there, and stayed out there watching TV.  My wife eventually came home to an empty house with every single light turned on and the radio going. She found me out in the cottage and was like, \\"What in the world are you doing? You left every light on in the house! And the radio!\\"  All I could do was reply sheepishly in a tiny voice, \\"I was scared...\\"

0062082353|2.0|As a veteran and american citizen I would be very afraid of this low-life. I commend him for his devotion to mission objectives but to trivialize its effects upon it victims is a definite show of low-character. He must dream of being the next Eric Prince with his new security firm. He is going to go one better, he is going to use his firm to train soldiers and militarized police to kill american citizens. His recent character assination and libel against Jesse Ventura must be due to the fact that without the revenue draining wars that are draining the American nation dry his new upstart security firm will lose the luctrative contracts he is seeking. The lies about Ventura came out just as he was leaving for remote regions of Mexico where he could not address them properly. Perhaps he has his intelligfence people training by stalking US politicians that don't agree to his viewpoint. Even Eric Prince would not have stooped this low. Will his new security firm have snipers caring out political assinations on american citizens in no time flat if he has his way. I have served in the Gulf in the 80's and it wasn't winnable then and it isn't winnable now and I am tired of footing the bill for it. I don't like Muslims either but discovered that the best way to punish them is to let them be Muslims. Buy this book and make this guy rich so jesse Ventura can have him prosecuted for assault and fleeing across state lines. After Jesse gets all his money and has him locked up these funds can be used to finance a Paul/Ventura presidental ticket that can restore the constitution and Liberty to the republic.

B0015DROBO|4.0|As others mentioned, the start of this book introduces so many characters that it's a challenge to keep everybody straight, but after you get them down, this book really flies. As soon as I finished it, I downloaded the next in the series.

B001F0WXY0|4.0|What an incredible world Dune is, with it's deserts and the giant worms that make it unique.  Frank Herbert's masterpiece is this book.  The sequals are good, but nothing compares to your first experience in the world of Dune.  This is high adventure and creative world building at its best.  I loved it.

0470424656|5.0|This book and Damodaran's Investment Valuation are the main valuation texts used in many of the top MBA programs.  Of the two, this is my favorite.  Part 2 of the book, Core Valuation Techniques, is particularly good.  The authors discuss the framework for valuation, how to assess historical performance, and how to forecast financial statements.  The comprehensive example discussed throughout these chapters shows readers how to handle the nuances of many non-operating components of a business such as the pension liability, excess cash, discontinued operations, etc.  The final chapter in the section proves that multiples, when used correctly, require the same inputs as a DCF model eliminating the critique that DCF valuations are untenable due to their heroic assumptions.    The second half of the book, although not as critical as part 2, has many very valuable chapters.  The performance measurement and management chapters are exceptional providing a framework readers can use to identify performance drivers, develop metrics to assess results, and design compensation structures to reward managers among other things.  For those thinking of purchasing the high-priced Valuation cd-rom, I do not recommend it.  The model included with the fourth edition of the text is much more simplistic than the examples shown in the book.  In short, this book is outstanding.  Every manager should read this book as well as Value: The Four Cornerstones of Corporate Finance, also written by consultants at McKinsey.  If you have to choose just one of the books, choose Valuation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is awesome. so many games to play! sometimes you get bonuses for no reason. I am delighted with this game.
0307949508|4.0|In this follow up to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, the second book of the Millennium series, The Girl Who Played With Fire, was probably even more fast paced than book one. In my opinion, you should read these books in order, as you'll really get a better feel for Lisbeth Salander, and what has been going on with her.<br /><br />As this story begins, Lisbeth Salander enjoying her new wealth, altering or should I say enhancing her appearance through plastic surgery, and relaxing at a hotel in Grenada as a terrible storm looms. Back in Sweden no one knows where she is, but Mikel Blomkvist, publisher of Millennium magazine, is preparing to run an explosive feature exposing of the underage sex slave business in Sweden, which involves some top-ranked officials and crooked cops. The day before the feature is to run the journalist responsible, Dag Svensson and his partner Mia, are murdered. The following day there is another murder, that of Nils Bjurman.  Although he seems unconnected to the other two,  he happened to be Lisbeth Salander's legal guardian.<br /><br />When the same fingerprints show up in both of these cases, the hunt is on for the elusive Lisbeth Salander.  Even her old pal Blomkvist has no idea where she is, but he believes she is innocent and wants to help prove it.  Having tapped into his computer, Lisbeth communicates in cryptic ways sending clues about who might be responsible.<br /><br />The book started out full steam, but then had several lulls throughout the 600+ page storyline (much could have been eliminated, in my opinion). There were too many unnecessary details, throughout the book.  Don't get me wrong, this was still a fantastic story.  I liked the direction the continuation of this series took, and while some interesting things were revealed about Lisbeth's family history, I felt the that the introduction lead the reader to believe that we would learn a lot more about why she is the way she is.  That just didn't happen.  The story did pick up again in the last third of the book, with lots more action and revelations, which made me as the reader anxious to read the final book of the series.hird of the book, with lots more action and revelations, which made me as the reader anxious to read the final book of the series.

0061438294|5.0|A lot of things that this book talks about make so perfect sense, however, without it pointing them out, we might really ignore all those signs.  It's a great book to read.  It of course takes constant practice to master the speed-reading skills.  The book just opens our eyes to it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|many games to choose from, a very large variety and it keeps your attention, you definitely don't get bored easily at all.

1596432594|5.0|I first heard about Feynman while I was a Freshman physics major over 40 years ago, when I bought my copies of the Feynman lectures.  Many years later I would read his papers on quantum field theory, attend his lecture on nanotechnology at Bell Labs, and hear from my father-in-law what an inspiring quantum mechanics course Feynman had given at Cornell.  This book is a good introduction to this world for either the layman or young people interested in science--and not just concerning the life of Richard Feynman, but regarding the habits of scientists and engineers in general.  Although most of us in the science and engineering community are (naturally!) not as brilliant as Feynman, our life stories and habits are similar in many respects--from a degree of social cluelessness that becomes painfully evident in our high school years, to arcane interests ranging from obscure ethnic music to dead languages.<br /><br />In addition to relating events in Feynman's life, from his safe cracking adventures while working on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos during WWII, to his reluctant acceptance of the Nobel Prize, the author has the Feymnan character in his cartoon panels explain many aspects of the physics to which he contributed.  I should note that many of these explanations are difficult to follow, and that the reader should not be unduly concerned if some of the points addressed seem illusive.  These difficulties are similar to those which I encountered in reading [[ASIN:0201510057 The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Volume 3: Quantum Mechanics]].  In that volume Feynman often emphasizes fundamental difficulties in understanding rather than focusing on the illuminating successes of quantum theory such as Schrodinger's solution of the hydrogen atom.
0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion  is a well-written, entertaining critique of organized religion and fundamentalism.  Dawkins is clearly a truth seeker, and some of his points are difficult to refute.  For example, he shows how the argument from intelligent design is its own undoing.  If items of great complexity are proof of a designer, that designer himself, being quite complex, must have been designed by an even more talented designer.  The book has two major weaknesses.  First, Dawkins makes no mention of the Sociology of Religion, preferring instead an evolutionary viewpoint.  He asks, \\"If religious beliefs are irrational, how did they survive the process of natural selection?\\"  He then discusses meme theory, meme's being ideas and beliefs whose evolution can be compared to the evolution of living organisms.  Those are interesting ideas.  But there is an entire body of literature, based in the Sociology of Knowledge, that provides better, more logical answers.  Well-known books like The Social Construction of Reality and The Sacred Canopy explain how humans create their own reality, and then anchor this cosmically through religion.  They also explain how reality thus constructed then becomes subjectively real to individuals, and how the human creation of religion in turn acts back upon its human creators.  Dawkins should let us know his position on this.  The second weakness is the lack of appreciation for religion's positive social and personal impacts.  A lot of altruistic behavior, social compassion, sincerity and value clarification are tied up in religion.  Yes, that doesn't prove that God is real. Yes, many evils also occur in the name of religion, such as making children afraid of Hell.  And yes, atheists can have positive values as well.  But it's naïve to believe the religious enterprise should just be stripped away because it's not based on logical argument.    Religion should continue to evolve and modernize.  It should embrace science fully, and let go of beliefsthat contradict science.  The New Testament is an improvement over the Old.  Currently, a big part of Christianity is the personal development angle.  And our view of God changes as cultural values change.  For example, since we no longer believe homosexuals should be executed, be assume the Old Testament was wrong about that.  Obviously, we're invoking moral standards that are independent of religion or at least of the Bible, as Dawkins points out.  The works of Bishop Spong illustrate how far this process has come.  Faith in the absence of proof can be a good thing, and that can only be measured by our ever-evolving values.    Nonetheless, a must read for believers and nonbelievers alike who seek the truth and want to think more clearly.

0385344325|5.0|Major Jack Reacher reporting for duty.  Terrific back-to-the-future Jack Reacher prequel:  Now we know the \\"Rest of the `Reacher' story\\"!  This is one of Lee Child's very best novels and harkens back to his first seven Reacher books in literary style and genius.  Probably the hardest thing to do in fiction literature is to write a good prequel, Mr. Child pulls it off in The Affair.  Even the book is written as a faux prequel of itself as he starts with the end then jumps to the beginning.  Dangerous, but Mr. Child is such an outstanding writer he accomplishes it to perfection.  Well done sir, well done.  The Affair will rank as one of Mr. Child's very best.  Especially after a run of good but not great Reacher efforts.  The Affair has Jack Reacher back in uniform as a Major in the U.S. Army in 1997.  He is detailed to a secret army base in Mississippi to go undercover and investigate the murder of a local woman.  The story develops as he is forced to work with the local sheriff, a former Marine female.  As the tale unfolds nothing is as it appears and soon Reacher discovers that several other local women have been killed over the preceding year.  As an Army CID investigator he becomes conflicted as he must protect the Army while his ethical duty demands he determine the truth no matter where it leads.  The elusive truth is out there but takes Major Reacher to the absolute limits of his investigative abilities to find it.  At times it appears EVERYONE is against Reacher and playing him for their own purposes, but Jack Reacher is smarter than all of them as The Affair unfolds.  Brilliant story wonderfully written.  Bravo Lee Child.  No gratuitous sex, language or violence.  Lots of well written action highlighted with wonderful deductive reasoning.  Superb character development.  This novel is a historical Jack Reacher gold mine.  Reacher is back in the army as a CID army investigator wearing his Class A uniform.  He is not the totally free spirit we have grown accustom to in other Reacher novels.  In The Affair he answers to an Army chain-of-command, and in some cases this chain-of-command is hostile to Reacher as it appears to be hiding an awful secret.  But Reacher's true character shows through, and by the concluding pages we now know why he left his beloved military for the freedom to wander as his own man on the highways and byways of America.  Must read if you are a Jack Reacher devotee and/or like Lee Child.  Mr. Child has written one terrific novel.  I know hardbacks are expensive so you might one to pick up this book at your local library.  It will be very tough to wait for the paperback--this book is just too good.  5+ stars.  Bravo Mr. Child keep up the  great writing.

B000002G7G|4.0|The Velvet Underground (self-titled - 1969)<br /><br />I've loved this band ever since a friend turned me on to them back in '89. I love and appreciate the impact they've had on rock n' roll and I'm an especially big fan of the songs themselves, many of which I consider to be all-time classics. But I've got to get something off my chest - Lou Reed's voice is pretty terrible. Not his voice per se but the fact that he sings flat. I recently listened to this album in the car on a road trip with my mom who has a good ear for music. She thought the songs were good but disliked Reed's voice, saying it was out of tune. She's got a point...still, Reed always puts a lot into his singing and delivers with great style and enthusiasm. I dig his voice, faults and all. Rock n' roll ain't always pretty! And he's a pretty creative vocal stylist: sometimes dark, sometimes funny, sometimes sweet, sometimes full-throttle gonzo, always entertaining. But yeah, technically, his voice sucks.<br /><br />As you've surely noticed by my rating, I don't hold THE VELVET UNDERGROUND in as high esteem as many if not most VU fans. This, their third album, is certainly a radical departure from the sonic meltdowns on their previous album WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT (- admittedly my favorite kind of Velvet music). The band claims their amps and gear were stolen which forced them to make a quieter album, although Lou Reed claims he wanted to go in this direction anyway to show a different side of the band. Most of the album contains top tier Velvet material, but as for the last three songs...well, let's just go straight to the...<br /><br />Breakdown!<br /><br />\\"Candy Says\\" (4:02) - While most of the songs are sung by Reed, it's new bassist Doug Yule who takes the vocals on the opening track. I think his voice sounds really nice here. His gentle, high-pitched singing compliments the androgynous nature of the song which concerns a real-life transvestite named Candy Darling. Such a quiet song, and that makes it a rather daring way to begin the album. \\"What do you think I'd see/ If I could walk away from me?\\" I think this is one of their best songs. *****+<br /><br />\\"What Goes On\\" (4:52) - The album instantly bursts to life the moment this infectious groover starts up. The clanging guitars really drive the song and when the guitar solo kicks in it sounds smooth as silk (note - see discussion in comments section regarding which Velvet actually performs this solo!). It's a really upbeat, feel-good song and it lasts a good long time too. I love hearing the bootlegs where it goes on forever - I never get tired of hearing it! *****+<br /><br />\\"Some Kinda Love\\" (4:00) - This one brings a real twangy country flavor, accentuated by drummer Mo Tucker on cowbell. It moves at a steady pace and a lot of the fun comes from hearing Reed strangely enunciating his intriguing and quite baffling lyrics. *****<br /><br />\\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" (5:38) - is considered a top classic among Velvet fans and no doubt it is gorgeous. It's slow and sweet if lyrically simplistic in a few places. But the lilting guitars are lovely and Mo's gentle tambourine is a nice touch. It's not a personal favorite of mine, but I'll give it five stars because it truly deserves it. It never wears out its welcome. *****<br /><br />\\"Jesus\\" (3:22) - Funny that I love this heart-felt prayer to Jesus Christ - I'm an atheist. But I find the song to be truly compelling and sweetly sung. The guitars are pristine, serene and simple - a beautiful song! *****<br /><br />\\"Beginning To See The Light\\" (4:38) - This is another jubilant feel-good song, the kind VU were so great at making. I would say this is one of their best in that vein. Reed is really funny on this one, just off the chain. This is classic VU - really upbeat, good-time rock music. *****+<br /><br />\\"I'm Set Free\\" (4:01) - is my favorite track on THE VELVET UNDERGROUND and I truly would've been happy if the record ended here, short as it would have been (and really, too short for an album, especially in 1969...but the rules were eventually bent. For example, the B-52's released a cool six song mini-album called MESOPOTAMIA in 1982 - too short to be an lp, too long to be an ep...). Anyway, \\"I'm Set Free\\" is simply majestic. Lou Reed rejoices in his new found freedom both solemnly and triumphantly. As to what he's been set free from, that's up to the listener. It's a very uplifting song until Reed throws you a curve ball: \\"I'm set free - to find a new illusion\\". I consider this song to be one of their best; it's definitely one of my personal favs. Certainly it ranks high among fans and I say it would've been the perfect way to close the album (in fact, I typically program out the last three songs.)*****+<br /><br />\\"That's The Story of My Life\\" (1:56) - This is an extremely dorky, rinkydink tune that I just can't stand and always skip. I don't think it's a good song at all and I find it really annoying. At least it's really short. *<br /><br />\\"The Murder Mystery\\" (8:53) - The weird one. Count on the Velvets to throw something bizarre into the mix. While I love experimental music, I don't often put this one on. It's definitely interesting and worth hearing - one or two times at least. I especially love it when this strangely oscillating organ comes in; it's sinister and intense as is the insistent guitar line. Taking avant garde to a new and different extreme, Lou Reed and guitarist Sterling Morrison recite words (some might say poetry), one guy regulated to each stereo speaker. They both talk at the same time and, disconcertingly, at different speeds. It's quite strange and it does sound kinda cool. But these segments are periodically interrupted by this limp, cheesy music and terribly off-key singing from both drummer Maureen Tucker and Doug Yule (who sounds awful here despite his lovely performance on \\"Candy Says\\"). The track eventually morphs into a bizarre finale with a climbing piano figure and various sound effects including what I'm pretty sure is a backwards guitar. All the poetry they throw at you sounds random and meaningless although the images are fascinating and occasionally thought provoking. The whole thing has this old TV detective vibe and the atmosphere is palpable. But because of Mo and Doug's singing, I unfortunately just can't bear to hear this track...I've actually thought about making a version that excises the offending parts and keeps the cool stuff. I would definitely listen to that particular version if I could pull it off. (ha ha thinking back there was one thing in particular that Mo would sing - \\"Oboe and me\\" (ugh) - that used to irritate me in the extreme. I hated it so much that if it was about to come on I would run across the room to stop it from playing!) ***<br /><br />\\"After Hours\\" (2:07) - Lou Reed may think it's charming but I really can't honestly say I like Mo Tucker's voice. It's small, cute, and sweet but her singing is hopelessly off key. However, the song itself is quite charming. It's got a quaint sound with a jazzy guitar strumming along to a bumbling bass and, OK, it is endearing to hear Mo long for a love in her life, one who will make the night \\"last forever\\". I often skip this song, but I'll be generous and give it four stars to acknowledge the legitimate appeal it has for some. ****<br /><br />note: There are two different mixes of this album. Personally I don't think it makes a whole lot of difference which copy you get. It used to be that one would almost certainly get the \\"rock mix\\" when buying this CD which was the original version released - against Lou's wishes. His own \\"closet mix\\" is the one he wanted to put out. It basically just boosts his vocals higher in the mix and it's long been available on the PEEL SLOWLY AND SEE box set. With the closet mix, Lou was trying to create a certain intimate atmosphere on the album and I would say the new remaster of THE VELVET UNDERGROUND pretty much achieves his original vision. As for myself, I can appreciate all these different versions. They're all good in their own way, and it's fun to decide for yourself which one you actually prefer.<br /><br />Despite the four-star rating, this album is highly recommended.uding what I'm pretty sure is a backwards guitar.

B00004R997|2.0|I've been collecting Disney's 50 animated feature films on DVD for the past 12 YEARS...The last one I needed to complete my collection was Saludos Amigos.   I ordered this DVD that was listed as the \\"Saludos Amigos Gold Classic Collection\\" DVD, which would have just contained the movie, Saludos Amigos, on it's own. Instead I received the \\"Classic Caballeros Collection DVD with Saludos Amigos AND The Three Caballeros\\". This is NOT what I ordered at all. I already own The Three Caballeros. Why would I need two copies of this movie? Very upset, very disappointed. I just want what I ordered...   Be wary of emerald_city_collectibles--their listing was false and I did not get exactly what I wanted.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|A fantastic, cream of the crop, murder/mystery thriller, which combines the outstanding acting talents of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the brilliant, script, written by Ernest Lehman, and the excellent directorial skills of Alfred Hitchcock into a classic, one of a kind movie, that has never again been duplicated by Hollywood.  In addition to the movie, the special features, in this, 50th Anniversary, 2-Disc, DVD set, contains: 1.)a notable, profile of Cary Grant, 2.)a behind the scenes tour, of the making of the movie, narrated by Eva Marie Saint, which includes interviews with: Hitchcock's daughter, Pat Hitchcock, writer, Ernest Lehman, and actor, Martin Landau, 3.)a critique and analysis of the movie by several film directors: Curtis Hanson(LA Confidential), Francis Lawrence(I Am Legend), Guillermo del Toro(Pan's Labyrinth), Christopher McQuarrie(The Usual Suspects), and William Friedkin(The Exorcist), 4.)a gallery of movie stills, and 5.)a really, cool, documentary, which examines Alfred Hitchcock's ingenious, ability to captivate an audience for the sole purpose of presenting a visually, engrossing, story, on-screen,(not to gross out the audience with endless scenes of blood and gore that is so common in many of today's superficially made films), to crown him, Master of Suspense!

If you are looking for accurate portrayals of ancient myth, this isn't for you, but if you are looking for fun stories, fun dialogue, engaging characters, and clean content, I highly recommend this series.  Yes, it gets a bit silly at times, but underneath the contemporary feel of the script lies a message about tolerance, true courage, and loyalty.  We are hooked, and I am just sad that I have to look elsewhere for seasons past the first one because Amazon doesn't carry them...and they are not easy to find because it is a BBC series.

1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs...Walter Isaacson...little else needs to be said about this biography.  As others below have mentioned, this depiction of Jobs is incomplete, but in my opinion that is due in part to who Steve Jobs was as a person.  The story of his life is so expansive that it seems almost impossible to encapsulate it concisely in a book.  The book does lean toward the long side, but take a chance and get to know a bit more about a man who changed the world we live in in more ways that we know.  This book gets 5 stars despite the almost oppressive media-driven deification of Jobs in the wake of his unfortunate passing.  By now you're sure to have read dozens of \\"Ways Steve Jobs Changed the World\\" articles, but this book gives you a completely different (in a good way) take.

B005LCECU6|4.0|When I heard about Rush releasing the Time Machine DVD (which I finally got last week with a gift card), I wasn't exactly in a hurry or rush to run out and buy it. Why? Because it seems like Rush have now been releasing a live DVD and/or CD for every current tour. And how many live versions of Tom Sawyer and Closer To The Heart do we need?<br /><br />When I heard about THIS CD, however, I immediately knew I had to have it and bought it almost immediately. The early period of Rush had so far been represented by just one live album, All The World's A Stage. This release goes back 2 years earlier, to 1974, while Rush were on tour for their first album and within a month or two of Neil Peart joining the group. This was a very young and loud and heavy and slightly obnoxious, almost punk-rock like in their energy, guitar driven Rush. And damn is it fun to listen to! Tis a pleasure to hear Geddy singing in his original granny, screeching impossibly high voice (even though towards the end you may...like me...find yourself nearly missing that smoother lower and mid range vocals of his from upcoming albums). It's cool hearing pre-Fly By Night versions of 'Best I Can' (here listed as 'THE Best I Can') and 'In The End'. And it's also wonderful to hear that original ultra thick heavy metal guitar sound of Lifeson's (that I missed so much during their synthesizer heavy Power Windows era). Early Rush fans will eat this up, partly due to the abundance of songs never heard on a Rush live album before, like 'Here Again', 'Best I Can' and 'Need Some Love' (okay, live versions of these last two do appear on some Rush DVDs, but I'm not really counting that) and for songs never heard on ANY Rush album before, like 'Bad Boy', 'Fancy Dancer' and 'Garden Road'. I would have to say my favorite moment on the whole CD is the intro for 'Need Some Love', which starts off with what sounds like to me some Ramones-like guitar riffing. Very cool!<br /><br />In terms of the mix, this is relatively well recorded, especially seeing that very little post-production work was done on it...or at least it seems that way. One can hear all the instruments very clearly, the guitar is very loud in the mix (as are Peart's drums)and Geddy's bass is also much more prominent in the mix than it was on any of the early Rush albums. The only time the sound bothers me is on the three bonus tracks from 1975, which show up at the end of the album. The bass is far too loud in the mix and very muddy sounding, and the guitar is almost completely buried beneath the bass and drums. While it's nice to hear these three songs again ('Anthem' , 'Beneath, Between & Behind' and 'Fly By Night'), I feel like this may have been a better album without them, due to their lousy sound.<br /><br />Overall, I would consider this a must have for early Rush fans, moreso than the recent Time Machine CD/DVD, at least from a historical point of view and to hear Rush back when they were still a humble heavy metal trio, before they got progressive and scientific. (And yes, I do like their progressive and scientific side!) I would give this 4 and a half stars. It would be a 5 if not for the bonus tracks.

B005HGZV6U|1.0|The audio is still superb, and the film itself is quite good.   But...  At first I was a bit sad that they kept the 4:3 format, but alas, it's the original release screen format, so why should they mess with that (I can hear some Kubrick fans applauding), but then... it's the worse blu-ray I have ever seen. It's like a low quality DVD pressed into a blu-ray format disk. It's horrible. I've seen online clips with better video quality. I'm so disappointed and frankly I'm shocked they would release it as is. Worst - blu-ray - ever.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are boring but most are pretty good. i would pay for this but luckily its free
B000MAK648|2.0|Short and simple. The scenes of the race cars are FANTASTIC! The story is long and boring. Come on, 3 hours!
0446563048|5.0|This book has been very inspiring for me.  I would like to buy a copy for all management in our company.  So many business miss the mark and think they are giving excellent customer service but customer service goes beyond the call and Zappo's definitely hit the mark on that one.  Not only is it inspirational for business it is highly inspirational for your personal life as well.  I am truly grateful I stumbled upon this book and the whole delivering happiness movement.  It is a lifestyle not just at the office.  Thanks Tony for a awesome lesson and for sharing.
B000EOTTV8|4.0|This trip is typical of what American film can do with cheerful music in the background. I was not expecting everything to be as close to the truth as the kind of art that is meaningful for me, but the sense of loss that pervades a series of human contacts that jump out at you like:<br /><br />Is this what you have done with yourself?<br /><br />is more like crazy subatomic particles than a nuclear family.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Y is you make the the hockey and wishing thinggy so friggin hard to work?!!! These two games irks me!!    __  Kindle Fire User
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Fast and doesn't lock up like one of its competitors. Pretty intuitive once you use it. Works well on my tablet also.<br />-- update -- I've learned that when I'm in hospitals, etc. where I don't have access to my wifi and probably don't have phone reception at all, this one locks up. I'd like the option to fully download so that this could be avoided. I'm not aware that I can. Let me know if I'm wrong.<br />This issue has caused me to pick a different product of choice.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We saw this film, several weeks after it had been released and heard many good and powerful statements regarding its message.  I was very suprised and pleased to see the seats completely packed, given that it is faith-based.  The film captures your attention immediately.  Some great action scenes.  The message of the film is clear and inspired this father to work harder at my role in the development of my child's spiritual growth, but also in other areas.  What is my legacy?  What is important to me?  How can I convey what a Godly man is?  Am I doing enough?  How is my walk?  Anyone who has children knows that you're constantly watched and parrotted.  Your children will learn directly from you and your behavior.  Aside from just the moral benefits of proper behavior, the spiritual meaning behind the behavior is crucial.  If they know your stand in faith, it adds credence and weight about your opinions.  They will remember how their parent instructed them in a particular circumstance and reflect on it.  It is ultimately their own decision on how they will act, but our model will influence it.  Great film, loved it.
0307888681|5.0|This book is the one you must!!! read. Really interesting, you can't stop reading.. and it is very easy language too( for non-native English speakers)
0143119680|4.0|This book was WAY out of my usual genre that I enjoy, but it came recommended by three friends (one of whom is a university professor). Very glad I gave it try, as it is well written with a very interesting storyline. Great vocabulary and well developed characters hooked me in the beginning. There is not a lot of \\"fluff\\" in this books but has a wonderful historical element. Look forward to the rest of the series!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I downloaded a different app to sketch, I like this one better because it integrates with evernote. Works well on kindle fire. Only downside is having to load photos to fire before bring able to draw on them.
B004SEUIW4|5.0|This is yet another coming of age stories set in the 80's. If you're into Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg or Ryan Reynolds you'll love this film. The soundtrack is amazing. That alone makes it worth checking out. The film deals with the post college crash/no mans land some of us have experienced in which you fall way short of everyone's expectations and have to take a dead end job to survive. This time at an amusement park, only to find there's interesting people and romance there. This is my favorite Kristen Stewart film. She's ends up in the middle of a love triangle with Ryan Reynolds and Jesse. Ryan Reynolds plays a rogue who constantly cheats on his wife and works at the park while pretending to be a rock star even though he's in his thirties.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. It is challenging and hard to put down. I have tried a lot of different games and I always end up going back to this one.
0143119680|5.0|I loved this book.  I was drawn in from the first page and could not put it down. The characters are interesting and the story is exciting and thoroughly enjoyable.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|[[ASIN:B006IGZWB2 The Help]] The film is a dramatic conversation of the change of tide in the Southern part of the USA in the 1960s regarding a long standing tradition of 'hiring' the black female househelp/nanny, yet considered a second class human being even though they cook, clean and raise their 'employers' children while looking after their homes for very little wages and long hard hours. The film is slow moving in the start but then picks up and does not stop till the end. It is a good movie to watch and I don't think anyone can really be offended by it. When you get to the end of the film you may not want it to end then...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its fun, just the adds are anoying and I cant figure out how to play some games cause I cant find any directions
B0063IH60K|5.0|At least every other day I have to play Solitaire before I go to bed or have some down time.  This is just good old fashioned fun on my tablet.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Got this for the Kindle Fire. Works great. Game play is smooth and graphics look great. Worth the hole 99 cents I spent on it, would have paid more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is a fun game for anyone looking to  entertain themselves. if your looking for fun games then this is the game for you:)
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Don Draper is the kind of man you love to hate. You (as a lady) hate yourself for loving him, but it's an admiration that you just can't shake. And his world is fascinating to say the least. What a great show for those interested in the creative side of the advertising process, especially in the 1950s--which i daresay is the MOST fascinating decade in American history, more influential and telling of the American psyche than even the 60s. To watch the value shaping influence that advertising in the 50s had on us today--with some damned sexy people to boot--it a complete and utter delight!!! If you haven't jumped on board the Mad Men craze yet, you're most definitely missing out!!
B0052U59F4|1.0|I wanted to like this book. I really did. It has so many fans and glowing reviews. But after 3/4 of the book, I wasn't left with an understanding of why it has been so well received. Instead, I was scratching my head. I have a love for emotionally charged BDSM romantic fiction, Fifty Shades of Grey was not was I was looking for. To be quite honest, I found it boring. The narrator was banal, flaky and irritating with her endless maudlin ruminating. Christian wasn't what I consider romantic or sexy, but rather immature and a bit creepy.      The author obviously has talent and a love of words, many, many words. This book could have used a thorough edit. It's overwritten, the protagonist is the epitome of a Mary Sue and the pacing drags. I found myself skimming to get to the meat of the story, hoping Ms. James would finally alleviate the boredom and give me something, anything, to keep me reading. Unfortunately, that never happened.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a good version of solitaire not too many ads and good ways to customize it.. def download for quality free game
0525478817|5.0|I always approach a new book with a sense of trepidation, particularly when the author is one that I am fond of. There's always the fear that this new book won't live up to my expectations, and then what? And, for the first chapter or so, this concern was not completely washed away. Sure, it was good, but was it ~really~ going to be better than Looking for Alaska, the way it had been hyped up to be? It didn't seem so, at first.   Still, it wasn't long before the writing settled into place and the characters began to take on sympathetic lives. I think John Green did what he set out to do--create a book about cancer, but not about cancer; write a story where the characters were not glorified as noble sufferers, but as people who are just as scared and lonely as anyone would be in their place. True to fashion, he wove humor amongst even the darker hours; he presented metaphors that were perhaps not in the grand literary fashion, but were honest to the human condition; he reminded readers that perhaps our heroes are not all we have idealized them to be.   I admit. I cried. I cried hard, but not for the characters in the book---I cried because the story found within it spoke to the reality of life; the reality that this could happen even to the person I care about most. I would confidently recommend this book to anyone, young or old, as a read that will engage both mind and emotion on a journey that leaves you not with a sense of loss, but rather a feeling of personal gain for having read it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very well designed and easy to use app...a verge wealcome addition to the Fire.  ...would recommend this over some local news aneroid weather apps.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This toy kept a lot of kids and adult busy over Christmas and beyond.  It is a delicate ball, so toddlers must STAY away!  and they willbe just as fascinated.  Really a great gift idea for any kid.  We got the epic version so not sure how it compares in difficulty.
1592642195|5.0|i bought this book as a gift for my husband.  he absolutely loved it.  writing was excellent.  characters were very interesting. plot was excellent.  he found it very sad and very interesting.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth is outstanding in The King's Speech. I have viewed it on the big screen as well at home. Interaction between him and his instructor is fabulously amusing, yet serious. This is a good glimpse of the Royal family at the outset of WWII.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun, great games. definitely remedies my boredom from time to time. i recomend this app to anyone that likes a challenge!
0553386794|1.0|This book reminded me in a way of Tolken's Lord of the Ring saga with the rich background materials.  GMMR has spent a lot of time and effort creating a deep world for the reader to explore.  However, Tolken had exciting action and interwoven plot lines, but GRRM's novel has a slow moving plot with little action (at best one could say there is a lot of suspense).    I would characterize the novel as a fantasy suspense novel or fictional political drama.  Definitely not an action/adventure story.  Entire chapters seem devoted to describing a historical incident.  I like an exciting story with many plot twists, so I cannot recommend this book
014241493X|2.0|I read this book while traveling to New York via car. (Spoiler Alert) Which is pretty cool because in the book, the protagonist does this. I think that this book is OK becuase Quentin Jacobsen has the \\"good life\\". I think of him as just a typical \\"Gary Stew\\". He has nothing unique, yet he thinks of himself better than all the other teens becuase he does these weird and heinous things. He is also one of the stupidest people I have ever read about. He throws his life away to chase after some girl who obviously has no ambitions and doesn't deserve to be chased after. He also says her name \\"Margo Roth Speiglman\\" over twenty times per chapter. In the book, he says \\" It all seemed so trivial , so embarrassing, it all seemed like paper kids having thier paper fun.\\" He thinks that he is too cool and unique for average life. He spends prom night in a rotting mini-mall smelling Margo's bedsheets (which is kind of creepy). And drives across the country for her. The good parts to this book were the hilarious jokes that appeared ever so often. This book is not really something that I would recommend to someone. He doesn't care about anything else, except for his one true love (not really) Margo Roth Speiglman.
0307595579|5.0|Wonderful and very enthralling. I was hooked after the first 10 chapters of \\"tattoo\\". The books as many will tell you, are littered with detail...almost to the point of annoyance. However, this is also showed how deep and how cared for the characters were by Mr. Larsson. The 3rd book (Hornet's nest) was by far my favorite book of the series. I have recommended it to many friends and gifted this bundle to my sister. She finished them quickly and raved about it as well. Highly recommend.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This remote desktop app is top notch. It seems to have the full functionality of my home computer desktop, and the gesture controls make for easy navigation throughout the interface. Definite must for users who need their mobile device for use at work or college. Must run the computer sound at 24bit/48000khz for sound to transfer to device. Kindle Fire/Windows 7.
0439023513|5.0|******THE CURRENT RAGE*******  I ordered this as a Christmas gift.  I was pleasantly suprised when the book arrived within two days of my order.  The recipent was very excited when the gift was opened.  From what I understand this is the current popular book series, which will be made into a movie.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Agonised over finding the perfect case for my Kindle Fire, and pleased to report that getting this case was well worth it. Snaps in and feels really solid, should provide just the right combination of protection while preserving the Fire's ease of use.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|cool when you're super bored since there is a billion games.. nice time passer buyer plus its free and that's always super duper
B0063IH60K|5.0|soothing and relaxation. a very great game.love to play before I go to bed. such plenty yo play on my kindle fire
B0032KNA4I|4.0|I love this movie, yes its over the top and maybe you're best chances of surviving the end of the world are if you're driving a limo.  I didn't read all of the other 500+ reviews to see if this was already done, but I want to mention the speacil features on the DVD vs the Blu-ray (single disc).  On the DVD are; \\"Time For Miracles\\" Music Video by Adam Lambert, Commentary with Writer/Director Roland Emmerich and Co-Writer Harald Kloser, Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending, Roland Emmerich: The Master of the Modern Epic.  The last of which is segment about the director.  On the Blu-ray are; movieIQ and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie,  Picture-In-Picture: Roland's Vision-Includes Pre-Visualization, storyboards and behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with filmmakers, cast and crew, Commentary with Writer/Director Roland Emmerich and Co-Writer Harald Kloser, Alternate Ending.  On the blu-ray we don't get the deleted scenes or the Adam Lambert music video.  We do get the movieIQ and BD-Live (if you have internet connection) and the picture-in-picture commentary \\"roland's vision\\".  While watching the picture-in-picture commentary, you unexplainably lose the translation subtitles (used when they're in France and China for example).  There's no reason for these subtitles to go missing, there's still room on the screen for them to appear.  I also don't know why the took away the deleted scenes.  But, overall, getting a blu-ray is about the picture and sound which are both better then the dvd version.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|North by Northwest is one of my favorite movies and I bought this because I thought my husband would like it(and he did).  I just recently discovered the movies of Cary Grant and have become a big fan so I was excited to watch the biography that was part of the second Dvd. It was excellent.  A great buy.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Great music if you or your kids enjoy their show.  My elementary age girls love it and so does their mom.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like the YouVersion Bible app, not because it does anything special with the Bible, but because of the reading plans. The reading plans have really helped me become much more consistent about reading the Bible everyday. That's priceless.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun, challenging games that are a good time killer and just take your mind off of whatever you're thinking about
B001NEK2GE|5.0|There is not enough I can say about this devise. It has completely changed the way i play video games. Initially I was trying to decide whether to purchase the G13 or the Razer Nostromo and i definitely made the right choice. The G13 has many more buttons (I use them all) and the joy stick is not a d-pad with a crappy covering.   Pros:  When I was deciding whether or not to purchase this, there were several reviews that really discouraged me, however, all of them were either wrong or didn't apply to me. The joy stick is not too pointy and actually feels wonderful. The contours of the pad are exceptional (I have medium to large hands). The software is also amazing and simple; drivers worked fine with windows 7. I use every single button on the device playing mmo's which is why this device has to be better than the nostromo. I didn't think i would use the lcd but it has proved very useful. The build quality is great. The tactile feel of the buttons is great.  Cons:  Here are a few minor complaints:  -The joy stick button is almost impossible to press to the point that there is no reason anyone is going to use it (i'm referring to pressing the joy stich itself, not the buttons around it).  -There is currently an issue with the software or drivers that cause the device to become nonfunctional when the computer wakes from standbye. The only remedy to this currently is to resart your computer or unplug and replug the device, however, i'm sure this will be fixed in the next update.  If you are interested in using a joystick for your games this is the device for you. You wont regret it.
1609611543|3.0|I just finished \\"Wheat Belly\\" and I'm torn. I'm sold on the message, but I've got to say the book itself is odd. It isn't poorly done, it is more like the author and the editor had conflicting ideas on what they were going for. Half the book is written for the average person and is full of jokes and puns, while the other half is pretty technical information that seems better aimed at nutritionists. It is full of great personal stories, but it seems like this would have made a better blog series than a book. I honestly can't see myself going back to it for any information later.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This movie is so good! Kids love it! It goes into detail about the lives of animals as well as bugs.  Very cool! Would recommend to anybody!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun and great liked by my self and my close friends we could not stop playing it it was that addicting
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app gives me something to do when I'm bored like long car rides or when I'm at school. a must have!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I have tried almost all the apps for hotmail and this is by far the best. it is easy to use and syncs great. I can manage my email right from my kindle fire. this the only hotmail app I like for the kindle. I have the official hotmail app on my iphone and so far I like this app on my kindle better. great job SEVEN!
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|having a kindle fire is worth it just for this game. the FULL VERSION I mean. I love using the old arcade style buttons. I just wish high scores would save and the controls on the atari2600 games were better.
B00664AM5C|3.0|CONTAGION is a compelling and chilling docudrama, a cautionary tale of fear and paranoia, interspersed with personal subplots.  Director Stephen Soderbergh's intent is somewhat vague---is the movie a political statement or a narrative personal drama?  Unfortunately, the personal storylines aren't fully developed enough to warrant involvement.  Many questions are left unanswered and two of the movie's name stars die rather quickly, although Gwyneth Paltrow's demise is fully explained by the film's finale.  Most of the performances are effective---Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jude Law---but I felt Marion Cotillard gave little to her role.  Jennifer Ehle as the courageous doctor impressed me the most.  John Hawkes did well in his very small role.<br />CONTAGION is a well-done film but its clinical approach didn't elicit an emotional response.
0007329067|5.0|I have never laughed more (out loud, with regularity) than while reading this gem. As a punctuation freak, I identified with all of the author's points, and her writing style is very engaging. I plan to buy this book as a gift for fellow punctuation freaks. It's a great book to throw in your purse and read in bits and pieces; just be careful not to read it at the funeral parlor.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm going to have to  uninstall this app since it ballooned to 26mb.  And to add insult to injury, it can't be moved to the SD card!  Are you guys nuts?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are some issues with response time making you fail the level that gets irritating. I am a little mad that they don't adjust the required number of points to proceed to the next level based on the difficulty of the game play instead of the blanket 4000 pts
B005CMGKTG|4.0|I got the movie for my boyfriend never heard of it before but we watched together and I thought it was a good movie and I am sure I will watch it again
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible app.  Very useful...use it a lot. Love the audio feature.  I use it for Bible study and Sunday School lessons.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I persionaly think that this game is completely worth it to download. although it is very addicting it is possible to stop I love this game so so so so.much
B006QKKN14|2.0|I think the first one was the best...then it was sort of rolling down hill from there, just a lot of gore and that is about it. Fine for some folks I am sure, just not my liking.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|from the moment I installed this app I was using it and it was amazing. howeber, the computer I installed it on started to get viruses and was very very slow.
0439023521|3.0|disclaimer--this is more my complaints than an actual review, so this will sound really negative, more so than how i actually felt after reading the book. also possible spoilers.  i wouldnt have to write this if not for the scene where the hero is supposed to die, but saved by the pompous arrogance of the killer. in a situation where 24 children are pitted in against each other in a battle to the death im supposed to believe that a little girl is gonna completely lose her focus and give the ole \\"im gonna enjoy this\\" speech. wtf!! kill her already! this is the most dangerous part of the arena. more than any other time in the book you should be looking over your shoulder and youre gonna get cocky? bad. bad, bad scene.   this isnt a reality tv book. its a barbarian sport book. and the barbarians are not givin any mental capacity at all or human characteristics.. people can do amazing things in a pinch, yet adrenaline never even enters the story... its just a book, so i guess its fine that only katness matters and everyone and everything else is just a prop... 11 people die in a brutal battle for tools, and apparently only those 11 received so much as a scratch during the battle.. like the victors received full health jugs after the fight. just props.  this event is bigger than anything that happens to these people. they have a hero in district 12 that has won before, yet theyve never seen the footage? they dont know how he won? like a 15 year old baseball freak in boston not knowing what david ortiz has done, and not understanding basic baseball strategy. i hate when people that dont know anything about sports try to write about a sport.  no one begins to crack up, lose their sanity in these awful conditions. it would be perfect if peetas purpose in the story was to keep katness' sanity, but its just not. the possibility of being drained from the constant unimaginable stress, like the adrenaline, is never introduced.  the puppy love scenes... dont get me started.  okay, a tad harsh. the book gets 3 stars. just i cant understand how you can write a book about sports and war, and be so negligent to the psychology of both. or a survival book without covering any basic human survival tendencies.
B005K17RU0|4.0|love this app. very helpful app to have looked up anywhere k was and it was right on the money.
B004S3X9ZS|5.0|I had not heard of the group Metronmy before receiving this CD as a Christmas present.  I liked the CD a lot on the first listen, but my appreciation for it and the group has only increased each time I have played the CD.  I will be picking up all the Metronmy CDs now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games  -Suzanne Collins  A best-selling YA book, certainly a must read for me. Though I had to repeat my \\"Please Please\\" slogans for getting this book, it was worth the money and the effort. Super easy to understand prose style of writing, and an extremely beautifully designed plot, this book often sent `Chills down my spine'. The story is made in the not very distant future where the whole of North America is made into a country (or continent rather) called \\"Panem\\", consisting of thirteen districts, and the \\"Capitol\\". All thirteen of these districts held a rebellion against the Capitol  in which the thirteenth was destroyed. So now, each year, the Capitol holds the Hunger Games in which 2 \\"Tributes\\" one girl and one boy is selected from each of the twelve districts who then fight till the death in an arena. The last man standing is declared the winner, and his/her district and the person himself is awarded enormously. The story revolves around a sixteen year old girl named \\"Katniss Everdeen\\" and a boy \\"Peeta Mellark\\" who are selected from their district, District 12, to participate in the Hunger Games fight against children younger than them and some tributes who are killing machines and who have trained themselves their whole life for this event. Breath-taking, full of adventure, unexpected twists, and of course fight. Suzanne Collins has done a mind-blowing job constructing the characters personalities and the cruelty of the Games. Being a YA book, this book is suitable for 12 and above.  With number 1 ranking in the Amazon Kindle Store, and in the top 100 for about 600+ days, this is a must read.  \\"May the odds be ever in your favour\\"
