1593081545|3.0|Mansfield is a leisurely tale following the Bertram family and its Price transplant through marital negotiations and trips to the country and financial threats no one seems to grasp the true dangers of. If the Antigua estates really had failed or been lost, it seems there would have been drastic repercussions; also, an ocean voyage in the 1800's was never anything to take lightly, much less travel in the third world. There was a strong underlying tone of menace to the Messrs. Bertram while they were away, but the at-home family seemed to continue perfectly sanguine. Except for Fanny, who is as gifted at Worrying as my mother, and that's pretty extraordinarily gifted.<br /><br />Fanny. Oh, Fanny. She's just so ... nice. She's so nice I want to throw an expletival qualifier in there, and I can't; this is Jane Austen I'm talking about. She's timid and fragile and sweet, and obliging and not as delicate as she seems, and sweet. And meek, and ... when I right-click on \\"meek\\", Word gives me synonyms: humble, submissive, gentle, docile, modest, compliant, and mild. And sweet. Far from a backbone, there isn't a vertebra in the girl's entire body. Her entire skeletal system seems to be made of cartilage. Jane Bennet is sweet and modest and docile too, but by golly she can stand up for herself or someone she loves if need be. I think in a confrontation Fanny might simply cry, and then faint. Not a character much admired in this day and age.<br /><br />But she's so sweet.<br /><br />I saw someone's Goodreads status update for P&P commenting on how much he appreciated the writing and the characters, but he was on such and such page and ... nothing ... was ... happening. I have never found that with P&P. Mansfield Park, however ... oh my. Fanny comes to Mansfield ... nothing ... Mr. Bertram and Tom go away ... nothing ... the Crawfords move in ... nothing ... Tom comes back ... protracted space of nothing ... Lovers' Vows and things happen for a few chapters and then Mr. Bertram comes home and everything comes to a screeching halt and ... nothing ... That, combined with the extreme meekness of Fanny, makes for a surprisingly leisurely and ... well, dull story. For the most part we share no one's thoughts but Fanny's, and hers are so very athletically self-effacing and charitable - even to Mrs. Norris, one of the people least deserving of charity in this novel, if not ever - that events are not exactly moved along. It's a jolt when, briefly and rarely, we are made privy to conversations between Mary and Henry Crawford, laced with languorous malice.<br /><br />Perhaps the purpose of this day-to-day gentle unfolding of story is to focus the reader on the small things that do happen. In a modern setting, the concerns which beset Fanny would be almost nothing. Certainly the drama surrounding the play would be non-existent; it would trouble no one that a group of upper class young folk would do an amateur play, even if it was a bit racy. But given the placid pond that rock dropped into, there is a very real tension and concern about the morality of it all.<br /><br />And perhaps the intent in making Fanny so stunningly selfless was to make it so very ironic when Mr. Bertram berates her for selfishness. Her reasons for doing what she does are partly selfish, but only a very small part; she can't explain without telling him things he doesn't want to know, which she would consider a betrayal of others. From that moment on Fanny's life becomes a nightmare. The wrong interpretation is put on her actions, and every word she says to Edmund or her uncle is contradicted or ignored. Every. Single. Word.<br /><br />\\"I don't believe I can love him.\\" \\"Certainly you can.\\"<br />\\"We are so very different.\\" \\"No you're not.\\"<br />\\"I don't want to talk to you.\\" \\"You say that, but what exactly do you mean? Tell me!\\"<br />\\"I don't want to talk about it.\\" \\"Well, we must, and I must tell your aunts. Oh, and your cousin. His sister and their entire staff already knows.We won't talk to you about it if you wish, not above two or three times. A day.\\"<br />\\"I will never marry him!\\" \\"I wonder what we should give you as a wedding present ...\\"<br />\\"No!\\" \\"You mean maybe!\\"<br /><br />It's horrifying. And, again, I've been there. You can say anything, and you might as well be speaking Aramaic from the response. Poor Fanny.<br /><br />My GR status update from Chapter 35: I'm 73% done with Mansfield Park: In the midst of Ch. 35; I don't know how this story ends. I've seen spoilers both ways: that she marries Edmund, and that she doesn't. And right now I can honestly say that if she marries him I ... shall be most provoked. I want to shoot him in this chapter. (Which makes a change from wanting to shake Fanny.)<br /><br />Oh well.We won't talk to you about it if you wish, not above two or three times. A day.\\"<br />\\"I will never marry him!\\" \\"I wonder what we should give you as a wedding present ...\\"<br />\\"No!\\" \\"You mean maybe!\\"<br /><br />It's horrifying.

B005HSL626|1.0|Fruit slice is better as said on the title this was actually the knock of of that. Therefore I rather play the original even if it has less colored blades and other add-ons
B005LAIH5O|5.0|\\"Wrath Of The Titans\\" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: A decade after his heroic defeat of the monstrous Kraken, Perseus - the demigod son of Zeus - is attempting to live a quieter life as a village fisherman and the sole parent to his 10-year old son, Helius. Meanwhile, a struggle for supremacy rages between the gods and the Titans. Dangerously weakened by humanity's lack of devotion, the gods are losing control of the imprisoned Titans and their ferocious leader, Kronos, father of the long-ruling brothers Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. The triumvirate had overthrown their powerful father long ago, leaving him to rot in the gloomy abyss of Tartarus, a dungeon that lies deep within the cavernous underworld. Perseus cannot ignore his true calling when Hades, along with Zeus' godly son, Ares, switch loyalties and make a deal with Kronos to capture Zeus. The Titans' strength grows stronger as Zeus' remaining godly powers are siphoned, and hell is unleashed on earth. Enlisting the help of the warrior Queen Andromeda, Poseidon's demigod son, Argenor, and fallen god Hephaestus, Perseus bravely embarks on a treacherous quest into the underworld to rescue Zeus, overthrow the Titans and save mankind.<br /><br />The cast led by Sam Worthington (as Perseus) is pretty good. The directing by Jonathan Liebesman is pretty good. The story by Dan Mazeau, David Johnson & Greg Berlanti & the screenplay by Mazeau & Johnson is pretty good.<br /><br />The music by Javier Navarrete is great. The cinematography by Ben Davis is great. The film editing by Martin Walsh is great. The casting by Jina Jay is great. The production design by Charles Wood is great. The art direction by Thomas Brown, Ray Chan, Jordan Crockett, Stuart Kearns, Mike Stallion & Mark Swain is great. The set decoration by Lee Sandales is great. The costume design by Jany Temime is great. The special effects supervised by Neil Corbould is great. The make-up effects designed by Paul Engelen is great.<br /><br />This is a pretty good sequel to \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" (2010). It is a little bit better than the first movie. This is an action-packed ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing at the same time.
1401937519|5.0|\\"Dying To Be Me\\" is well written, clear, and easy to read. It's one of the finest books about a<br />spiritually transformative experience (STE) I've ever read. If you like to read uplifting books about near-death experiences, after-death communications, out-of-body experiences, orbs, and similar topics, you'll love this one.  It will s-t-r-e-t-c-h you. It will provide new perspectives on life, death, life after death, how your thoughts and beliefs affect you, and your health.  If you read only one book during the next 12 months, choose \\"Dying To Be Me!\\" Buy it, read it, recommend it, and give it to others. On a scale of one to five stars, it deserves a meteor shower!
0345522478|4.0|I appreciated the depth of knowledge and respect Hearne seems to have for Celtic mythology and history; I appreciated the tone of the work, and the characterizations of the gods. The Celtic god of love is not Cupid. The sense of humor in the first-person narrative is one of the main reasons to become fond of Atticus - and the humor started with the dedication. (\\"Hey, Mom!\\") It manages to avoid most of the clich&eacute;s that have developed in urban fantasies, except perhaps in Mrs. MacDonagh (the elderly Irish widow neighbor of Atticus whose yard he keeps up, and whose eyes are opened in the course of the book to his actual nature); I'm not sure how I felt about her. She came the closest to being a \\"shure and begorrah!\\" kind of Irish character.<br /><br />I'm not going to make a spectacular effort to get my hands on the rest of the series to date; three of the six projected books have been released to date, and I may just hold out a little while longer. But it's nice to know there's a series out there in which the Irish is a whiff of peat and whiskey, and not Lucky Charms. I'm grateful for that.<br /><br />Full review on my blog:[...]

0743497465|5.0|I read all the other Dan Brown books before I went back for Deception Point. My concern was that it was early Brown and would not be that good but I was completely wrong, this is much better than the later written-for-the-big-screen stuff.<br /><br />I think that it did not do as well as a book compared to the othes because it is too complicated to make into a film, we would need subtitles to keep the characters straight.  There are actually two in the hot, young, politically ambitious, well-connected, very bright, looking for love in all the wrong places category. This book could form the basis for a whole new season of Rockford Files episodes.<br /><br />Now let me tell you what is good about Deception Point.  It is loaded with incredible plot twists.  We have characters thought long dead suddenly reappearing as the antagonist. The prototype of goodness becomes the very basis of evil. The research and science is fascinating, as Brown dives deep into every facet of how things work but he follows the political trail just as well. This novel is constructed like a 18th century Swiss timepiece, with every event perfectly timed, lubricated, and building on its well researched antecedents. What hurts this book is we have a bunch of un-neccessary characters, although one can pretty much skip them.  For example why do we need a friend at ABC News?
B005F3GMAO|5.0|Richard Branson is one of the best businesmen around. I love reading his books and it is the second time I have read this book. You learn a lot of things from his books. He keeps things simple but always thinks outside the box. One thing that I have learned is that if you want to make it to the top you must think outside the box and keep this simple.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|I'm just listening to this now for the first time.  I've got $5K or so into my home stereo, which includes notably nice speakers that feature $200 Scanspeak tweeters.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, it's immediately evident that the remaster dispenses of the harshness that's profoundly evident in the original release, which sounds like an MP3 file in comparison.  The remaster's sound simply flows like a free-running, medium speed, glistening mountain river cresting over water-honed stones.<br /><br />The genius in this album is astounding; nobody makes music like this anymore.<br /><br />This is so good that I'm thinking about buying a second one to store and I'm only half way through Disc One.  (Just what ARE they \\"doing in the Hyacinth House?\\"  And did you know that the referenced \\"lion\\" in that song was actually a house-cat that was present while Jim was writing the original lyrics - in pen on cheap, blue-lined writing paper?)<br /><br />This just rocks!  I'd give it six stars if they'd let me.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Wow...this story gave me a glimpse of what a family goes through during a trial. If so it is totally sad. Can't imagine them living their lives that way. Very very good book. Praise to the surprised ending.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was very skeptical at reading this series when I first started hearing about it. I didn't want to read books about teenagers having to kill each other, it just seemed to macabre to me. I finally decided at $18.99 for the series on my kindle, it was a good deal and with all the hype it's getting, I'd try it.<br /><br />From the first chapter I was hooked. You could just feel the desperation of the characters but the focus of the book was not on the \\"Hunger Games.\\" It was on the conditions of the characters in the district. The message of the book focused on the control the government has on the people of the districts; they are basically slaves to the people of the Capitol. It also focused on our cultures fascination with reality TV and the sport of seeing others in worse situations than ours.
B000683VI4|5.0|I like this movie. It is beautiful and touching. But I am so sick of it. It seems like this movie is all they play on tv. I'm sure this movie is lovely to a lot of people, but don't they know it can start to suck if they over play it?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Of all the free solitaire apps out there this one seems to not only run the smoothest but also has the least obtrusive ads. They pop up between games and you barely realize they are there. I have used the app on several different devices without issue. Samsung Moment. HTC Evo phones. velocity A7 tablet. Coby tablet and my Kindle Fire all without issue. If you love solitaire this is the app...
B000OIZUW6|3.0|I ordered the book, Jackdaws by Ken Follett, for my Kindle as my book club had chosen it for its next read. I have enjoyed several of Follett's books and looked forward to Jackdaws. I hate to say I was a bit disappointed, but it was very perdictable. A little more intrigue and a less superhuman heroine perhaps? In a horrible and dangerous time, World War II when France was occupied by Germans preparing for a major battle with the Allies, the heroine never faultered. Realistic? Not really.
0887081770|1.0|Like a previous customer, I saw the description \\"hardcover\\" and thought I was ordering the large book. I was disappointed to receive a tiny version of the book. I wish the size was described next to the title. Great gift for a baby shower though.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This concert version is far better than the movie that was released starring Emmy Rossum.  It is beautiful and breathtaking and I literally cannot stop watching it.  Each time I watch it, it gets better. If you haven't seen it, please give it a chance! It is a beautiful piece of theatre and we are so lucky to have it preserved on DVD! The only cons are due to the fact that there is some limited staging options because it is performed in Royal Albert Hall where they cannot have the beautiful chandelier that hangs there truly fall and some of the set is done with a projection screen. Honestly, neither of these really bothered me because look at the filmed versions of Les Mis, they had no set at all. This is a 99% fully staged production that is only missing the chandelier rise and crash. But this is no way detracted me from how good the overall product was!! STUNNING!
B005LAIGP0|5.0|This movie was produced with shocking the audience as its' goal.  Every trick in the book is used to send chills down your spine.  Very well made ghost story.  Recommended for those who want to experience that foreboding feeling of eminent, inescapable danger but want to have the experience from the safety of their theater seat.  Imagine you are alone in a haunted house with no way to leave the area.  Imagine spooky sound effects and music is playing in the background.  If you like getting scared, you will like The Woman in Black.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a good sequel of \\"The Hunger Games\\" but too much like book 1. This is the story of the districts rebelling. I still think it is worth reading the third final book to know what will happen with the rebellion

0307592731|5.0|\\"Wild\\" is the best book I have read in a long time. It is beautifully written, fascinating, interesting, thought-provoking, and addictive. I read it in one giant week-end setting: I ate, slept, and was on the trail. Seven stars!
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|I am not going to spend too much time on the review of this Blu-ray, that has been done professionally and met with positive reaction (Metal Hammer 8/10,  Kerrang! 4/5, Allmusic 3.5/5 and Classic Rock was the most critical with 6/10).<br /><br />That being said, personally, I liked the split screens. Every now and then it gets a little too much, but it really helps overall, as picture doesn't change every second or two like previous releases and it flows more naturally. I also enjoyed the sound, I think it's a little better than Flight 666, the base stands out more and gives more depth to the concert. Obviously the quality of the video is superb. Someone said here that it was filmed with RED cameras (which are top of the line cameras that were basically used for every single movie in the past few years). I don't know if that's 100% true, but nevertheless, it is in HD. The only thing about video is that sometimes Bruce's face is a little overexposed, obviously due to spotlights being aimed at him, but it's not too distracting.<br /><br />I saw them on this tour live and I was really looking forward to this release. I have seen their old stuff and although their 80s work is one of the most influential and highly acclaimed in the metal community, I really enjoy their new songs as well. What was very interesting is the documentary. It really gave an in-depth look into how everything is brought together. I probably liked it more than Flight 666 documentary.<br /><br />They are the same band as they were before, because they play for themselves. Going back to Live After Death, Bruce was always jumping like there is no tomorrow and Steve would run across the stage. Nicko was always a funny man out of all of them always making faces. Adrian and Dave, for the most part, were always standing next to each other on the left side of the stage. The only addition was Janick, which, again, didn't change either from their early 90 releases.<br /><br />I think the documentary really shows how they feel about what they do. They didn't fall apart years ago and blew their money off and then started reunion tours to get some quick cash. They've been around since 1975, and they are not going anywhere. They play more countries, bigger stadiums and their albums are hit after hit. Just look at their albums in the past 10 years, it's been steadily moving up in charts with their last release reaching nearly No.1 spot all over the globe.shows how they feel about what they do.

B004132HZS|5.0|I'm convinced Steven Moffat must actually be a time lord to keep so many time periods straight in Doctor Who, and Sherlock shows that his brilliance isn't limited to the Tardis.  This is the first version of the Sherlock Holmes character that I have ever seen do justice to the books.

B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book is concise and on target. Rapport building is the essence and foundation of interpersonal communications. The author structures the book in an organized 10-step process, providing examples that are useful to anyone that relies on relationship building. Having spent two decades in various liaison positions, I was impressed with the content of this book. Everyone will benefit from reading this insightful book.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I can see why people might not like this, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Didn't find the acting as bad as some are making it out to be. Cillian Murphy did a good job (as always) as the bad guy. I bought this on a whim, trying to find some stuff Cyberpunk-ish. This was listed as something similar to it. I'm a big fan of The Matrix Films and Deus Ex video games. So if you're into that sort of thing, I suggest you at least look it up and see if you're interested in it. I do agree with a lot of reviews, the movie does leave things to be desired, more about how the time currency came into play is really one that stands out to me. I still enjoyed it quite a bit.
0385534639|3.0|This book goes on too long! The descriptions are like a hypnotic induction, and, at first that's enjoyable, but the story is disjointed and the characters come and go and then show up so much later you've forgotten who they were in the scheme of things. I'm only finishing it because I've put so much time into it already. The author is definitely talented, but ......
B00280LYIC|3.0|I'm torn on whether to rate The Lightning Thief a three or a four.  It has several points in its favor.  For example, the narration is fun and breezy, and the characters are distinct and relatable.  Also, it is amusing to see how the Greek gods are portrayed and modernized.  As in the mythology, they love playing with the mortal heroes' lives.<br /><br />To me, a negative point of this book includes its being very predictable.  It was evident to me early on who the traitor was.  Other plot points proved to be foreseeable as well, but more minor in scope (the identity and introduction of Aunty Em come to mind).  The book also contains many parallels to Harry Potter, which seems to be a common complaint.  The writing style is intriguing, but not the best of the best.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book.  It's a quick and fun read--a little silly, but immersive, with plenty of action.  I rooted for the heroes and found them likable.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|Very enjoyable, just wish there would have been a lil'more character development and longer running time but all & all a good action flick. Zoe saldana gives me boners every time.
1594630844|4.0|This is a great book about life and its pleasures and pitfalls as told by the true experts, mature adults aged 65 and over.  Get anyone you can under 40 to read it!  The rest of us must skip around as some matter may be irrelevant or already learned the hard way.  I wish it had been available to me as a younger person, before I made some misjudgements.  It is very values-centered in answering the question, \\"What is REALLY important in life?\\"  Kudos to the author for giving a voice to the oft-ignored older adults among us.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I read the first two novels in this series with glee and appreciation. The author demonstrated both talent and skill, and her technique was exemplary.<br /><br />Mockingjay, however, is a failure and it is a failure on so many levels. Writers take their readers on emotional roller coasters all the time and readers usually enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, the Mockingjay roller coaster crashes and burns with its grotesque plodding from misery to misery. Katniss merely reacts, when she's not either sedated or wallowing in pain, and there is certainly no further development of her from the first two novels. The hodgepodge of scenes and contrived and pointless deaths of Finnick and Prim feel disjointed and unfocused, a blur of deaths among many until we finally reach an ending of sorts - a scrap of epilogue thrown to readers, almost as an afterthought, that offers no redemption or closure, little healing, and less hope for the emotionally dead Katniss.<br /><br />If I'm going to ride an author's roller coaster, I want to be entertained, enlivened, exhilarated, not lectured and pummeled with unrelenting misery messages.  One can only speculate about the author's motives. If it was her intent to create a dismal, depressing work and pointless ending suitable for the effete, she has succeeded. I, for one, will never read anything else she writes, because I don't trust her anymore.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Sat down as a family to watch this movie.  I personally was not expecting too much.  Ended up LOVING the movie.  Reminded me of a robot Rocky.  If you are at all doubting watching this movie, please watch.  You will enjoy!
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|The film's title \\"Drive\\" might be misleading. Ryan Gosling's laconic hero is a Hollywood stuntman and garage mechanic by day and getaway driver by night, but car action scenes, superb as they are, are sparse and low-key, compared to, say, \\"The Transporter.\\" Based on a James Sallis book, the film is more like a crime noir about a mysterious man, whose past no one really knows.<br /><br />The storyline itself is not very complicated. Some may say it is conventional. Ryan Gosling plays an unnamed protagonist, a driver wearing a scorpion-embroidered jacket, who befriends his next-door neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). To help her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), an ex-convict heavily in debt, Gosling's character agrees to do a job for him as a getaway driver.<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" benefits from the capable acting from Ron Perlman and cast-against-type Albert Brooks, but it is excellent Ryan Gosling who carries the show throughout. The film is also memorable for its nice camerawork by Denmark-born director Nicolas Winding Refn (\\"Pusher\\") using the highly stylized lighting. The film's eclectic score is also effective in creating the dark mood.<br /><br />\\"Drive,\\" often bloody and violent, is less about car action stunts (which are very good) than about those characters, whose fates it seems are already sealed before the film begins.
B006INDTAQ|4.0|We don't usually splurge and see movies in the theater, nor do we usually pay for a movie to \\"stream,\\" as we usually watch the freebies. Sometimes we break out of cheap mode and pay for a movie to stream through Amazon. We were pretty happy with this movie, which had a good cast. If you're looking for something a little different, I would say this is a good movie to watch.
B00486U2VY|2.0|I watched the television series of Pretty Little Liars first and decided to try out the novel. This book is entertaining but it was really short. I cannot stand these series that go on for 8 or 9 books (except for Harry Potter of course) and it takes 3 books to finally get into it. This series should have been made into a trilogy, it would have tempted me to buy it because its so much cheaper to buy 3 books instead of 8. So the book was good... but I refuse to buy the million other books to finally find out the story line and who A is.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyable story - good plot and writing and clever twist to have the grand jury transcription mixed in with the plot narrative. I would have given it 5 stars but I had a problem with the gene theory which is a bit too glib but central to the story.<br /><br />Some years ago I went on a genealogy trip to Newton and found the graves of my great grandparents nearby and actually got photographs from the late 1860's at the local theological seminary where my great great grandfather taught. So, as a bit of a side benefit of the story, I got to revisit the town.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down, read all the books in 3-4 day.<br />I've recommended the book to many friends and they too have not<br />been able to put it down once they picked it up.

B0058EBNAO|1.0|I am really into weather so when I saw this app I knew it was perfect! Unfortunally, I found out that you had to pay for it. I recommend to Elecont&trade; or Amazon&trade; to make this app free.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Disappointingly short for a three dollar game. I don't know why it's okay to charge full price for half a title. I like the new physics, but there just isn't enough content to warrant the price (yet?).
B004EBZX6W|4.0|works well time sequenced graphs.  signal strength meter gives good feedback as you move around.<br /><br />although it has limited filtering capacity, it needs to be able to. exclude AP that you find unneeded
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Drawing Pad is the best ever. I give it to my sister and she becomes quiet for a whole hour. I use it on my Kindle Fire and it works amazingly great. All you have to do is scroll & tap. I would recommend it to people who have a baby on their hip who isn't very happy with toys or isn't entertained.
0307474259|4.0|I loved \\"almost\\" everything written in this book and I believe it to be the truth, based on other readings over many years and my own experiences.  But, I have one HUGE issue with the author about his recommendations about his suggestions for artificial sweeteners...the use of \\"Aspartame\\",AKA Nutra Sweet!!! This intelligent authority on health does not know about the extreme dangers of aspartame?  Where has he been? Anyone who wants to know about this incredibly toxic poison that is 10% wood alcohol needs to read anything authored by Dr. Russell L. Blaylock, who's a former neurosurgeon about the effects of asparatme on the brain as well as Dr. Mercola and many other authors out there who know about this.  View the DVD's \\"Sweet Misery\\" and \\"Sweet Remedy\\".  The FDA approved this artificial sweetener in the 70's and immediately, within the first year on the market had tens of thousands of complaints from consumers about the sweetener's affects on the body.  It was taken off the market for a short while to investigate further and was in the 80's, cleared again by the FDA for human consumption...with disastrous results to tens of thousands of people.  I am appalled that the author,Taubes does not know about this and is recommending the use of asparatme to the readers of this otherwise, fine piece of research and information.
B003O85W3A|3.0|If you throw out tracks 3, 10, 11, 12, and 13, this album plays much better.  It is a bit bloated with the idea that it's probing some important depths of and making insightful statements about suburban existence.  It's overall a pretty good album but I don't think commenting on suburbia for a whole album was a strong choice.  It's unfortunate that the weakest of the 3 full length Arcade Fire albums is the one that wins the Grammy.  It rather feels like a make-up award (like Whoopi Goldberg getting the Oscar for 'Ghost', clearly a make-up award for having screwed up by not giving her the Oscar for 'The Color Purple').  'Neon Bible' was a better album than this and 'Funeral' was better than 'Neon Bible' and the Grammy voters eventually realized they seriously blew it by not even putting either of the first two albums up for the award, so they tried to make up for it by handing one out for 'The Suburbs'.
B005MYEPXC|1.0|As a long time Woody Allen fan, I couldn't wait to see this film...what a diappointment!  This movie in a word is \\"pretensious.\\"  Trying to be high class while being a horrible movie.  If you love all that fake glamour of the 1920's, go for it.  Otherwise, spend you money elsewhere.  I regret to say that I am no longer a Woody Allen fan.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|loved it. Very different from anything that I have read before. I found it hard to get into in the beginning, but that was probably because my head was still in the previous book read. But once I got into it, I enjoyed it very much. Am now going to read the rest of the Trilogy.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|What else can I say? This movie SUCKED. SUCKED. SUCKED. But it wasn't bad enough to become good again (like Torque). Save yourself.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I am one of the many people that grew up with Harry Potter and loves the books with all my heart, and the movies. I honestly love this one the best! I thought the music was fantastic (I'm sure people will challenge me on that!) and just the way they did everything was perfect! I loved it so much the second time I went to see it in theaters I was more excited than the first time! I don't think part 2 was anywhere near as good as this one, so thank god they split it up because it would have been terrible to have the last movie be bad!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this game on Kindle Fire and I love it! The graphics are great and it is just plain fun! I like that you can choose the cards and fifteenth ways to play also.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|The G13 will help you take your gamming to the next level with programable macros and keys.<br />I use the G13 to play WOW and SWTOR,The G13 comes with a preloaded WOW profiler I use this profile has a template to make new ones works out great.<br />MAKE sure to download the latest driver from logitech website because the drivers that come with it are out dated and will not work with SWTOR
B003YL4LYI|3.0|this book and Feast for Crows are so far both VERY weak by comparison to the frist three books in the series.  Its not a terrible book, but I have read MUCH better ones
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Heard a lot about this book - who would play the lead in a movie, what a great book it was, etc., etc.,<br />So, I decided to download the sample.<br />Are you kidding me?  The first chapter reads like a slapped-together \\"who cares how it's written, just get the back history over with and get to the sex\\".  You know the kind of book I'm talking about - written by a guy named \\"Frederick von Veters St. John\\".  So, the dear little protagonist falls into the office on her hands and knees and proceeds to wrangle with the digital recorder whilst flushing to her pretty little (unbleached) roots.  OMG!<br />Please, readers, don't even bother.  Use your hard-earned money on books that don't pretend to be more than what they are - $0.99 will get you what you want - no muss, no fuss!
1612130283|1.0|I have to agree with the reviewer(s) who claimed that this was poorly written (an understatment) and not the least bit erotic.  I am game for the erotic novel...don't want anyone to think I didn't like this because I'm a prude...far from it...but this was pure drivel.  The writing was just terrible, puntuated with lots of \\"Er...I don't know what you want Christian\\" type things and just abolutely left me cold. After all the hype, I was really prepared for a good sexy read. but I can't imagine anyone, not even a teenager, who is turned on by this.  It is just so infantile, boring and trite that I am not going to be able to finish the book, and I never do that.  I can't believe that they are going to make this crap into a movie. I, for one, won't waste my money. I wish I hadn't on the book.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|I was a little concerned when I saw price difference in this product over the domestic version.  I have watched all the movies and associated disks and found them to be top quality.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I am not the kind of person who religiously watches tv shows but I am hooked on this show and the books. The characters in the show all struggle with secrets and lies big and small which makes the show so watchable. I've got my mom and sister hooked on the show and reading the books. Two thumbs up!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Visually stunning.  Compelling action.  Emotional intrigue.  Epic battle scenes.  Fabulous costumes.  Great acting.  A historic heroine. Two hours of entertaining transportation to and immersion in the middle ages for less than $10.  A dramatic opportunity to teach history.  Sure, there are inaccuracies, but those are what as known as teaching opportunities. Seriously 3-star Mr. Grady Harp, what's not to like?  Five stars easily.
1469984202|5.0|Definitely worth your time. You won't be able to put it down. Heads above all the brain candy being pumped out to make a quick buck.
B005K17RU0|5.0|what else would you use? works great on my kindle fire. accuweather never fails to impress me with their apps and services.
B003E47HP0|5.0|This model is easily the second best Ferrari model Revell has ever created. (Enzo is the first) It is incredibly detailed and I learned a whole lot about the 458. But, it was a VERY challenging model. I would NOT recommend this to a beginner. It has a step where you have to torch the end of a screwdriver and melt the front axel into place. I found this step very hard and frustrating. This model was so fun, I am going to buy another and paint it a different color than the typical Ferrari red. Overall, this model was fantastic. Colors/paint needed to finish: Aluminum, flat red, gloss red, silver, semi-gloss black, steel, tan, transparent red, metallic silver, flat black, Gloss light blue, Gloss green, light grey. Materials needed: Paint brush, plastic model cement, paint listed above, lighter/torch, hobby knife, screwdriver, water, paper towels for drying decals, brush soap.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Let met start by saying that I completely fell in love with this trilogy, especially books 1 and 2. Book 3 was fantastic until the last few chapters where things  take such a  dramatic turn, our erotic Christian has changed and I'm not sure for the better. I was totally taken aback by the ending that It left a sour taste in my mouth and left me saying \\"really?\\" it didn't work with the theme of the book, there would have been so much potential for more in this series, even another book had this ending been different. Very dissapointing ending, BUT don't worry, the book is still pretty good, but nothing can top 1 and 2.
B0041B785Y|5.0|Wow. Simpler but maybe more crushing than their other releases, Koloss pounds.<br />Sledgehammer intensity but with an overall groove that just makes me want to play it again and again. The neighbours have fled the area. I have secured all loose objects in the house. (I once played \\"Bleed\\" so loud my girlfriends best crystal vase vibrated itself to the edge of a shelf and moshed itself to death on the floor below!) Can't wait to get the vinyl, bottom end will be massive!
0545265355|5.0|This is a really fun series.  Fast paced and gripping.  Reminds me a lot of Ender's Game (which I loved) not as well written as Harry Potter, but still really fun.
B006MGC3VK|5.0|Really enjoying this one from OSI - as good if not better than anything else they have done. Some trademark heavier tracks - \\"Cold Call\\", \\"Guards\\", and the instrumental \\"Enemy Prayer\\" and some wonderful gentler moments as well, favourite tracks at the moment are the dreamy \\"Wind Won't Howl\\" and the nearly ten minute closer \\"Invisible Men\\", with its many twists and turns, maybe the most complex piece they have ever done. Gavin Harrison's drumming is an added bonus throughout the disc. Drum sound is fantasic. I have listened to the CD on my home stereo with 15\\" Tannoy speakers (old but classic!) and in my car, and have found no problem with the audio quality. I was also fortunate enough to get a copy on vinyl, which sounds even better. Don't be put off by technical mumbo jumbo you may read, just buy this release and crank it up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app.its the best Bible app so far that is good.this app is also on the apple products too.on apple its amazing.I like how you can read the Bible on a portable device but its still not the same in the bible
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|allaround great game great for kids an your grandma maybe even or grandpa or great grandpa or even your pops whatever or who ever it may they or it will get a kick out of this an its free best free games out are angry birds!!!!!!!
1932735410|5.0|The PMBOK gives the fact, Rita's book gives the theory and forces you to think which is what is needed for the exam.  Just got the book and immediately recognized my knowledge gaps/deficiencies.  Will have to read this book at least 3 times.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Stieg Larsson's book 2 of the Millennium Trilogy is as captivating as the first. Will keep you riveted to the text throughout. Wish the Millennium series could have gone on for several more books.
0439023513|4.0|Vague Spoiler Alert<br />I loved this book.  In many ways it was the best book of the series.  I did read the reviews before and in some ways I think that it helped me to enjoy it more since I was prepared for the devastating parts.<br />I know why some of the reviewers were upset, the first two books were very different and this was almost an adult book compared to two teen books, but the arc of the books made sense and I (mostly) loved the ending.  Much of the third book was forshadowed in the first book- the loss, the mother's depression, the fight back, being forever changed etc.  I thought it was realistic and well told.<br />The truth is that after what they went through, they could never be the same.  Many great books have this: Frodo leaves middle earth in LOTR series, In Bel Canto the damaged characters marry, and many more.<br />Where this book disappoints is with Gale.  I understand the choice, although it was not what I wanted as a reader, but to utterly throw away the character was awful.  There is some resolution with her mother, about Prim, and even Finnick is given a young son for some kind of peaceful closure.  Gale nothing.  Even a few sentences that were to the effect of : \\"When I heard Gale married Madge [(she lived) and/or Johanna], I was initially surprised, but it made sense finding love in something familiar.......I was happy for him\\"  This would have made the whole difference for me in this book.<br />That being said, I still enjoyed the story, cried at the ending and have thought about it for weeks.  It is a wonderful read and the scene with Snow/Coin is one of the best in the the series!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A great novel to read because it is real in detailing the struggles that can come with having cancer. On top of that it covers ideas that can be thought provoking and inquisitive.
0375869026|5.0|Have you ever wondered how you would view the world if you saw it from a severely disfigured face?  How would you feel every time a stranger glanced at you and either looked shocked or quickly diverted their eyes?  Would you face each day with courage, and hope for glimmers of kindness, or sequester yourself away from the world's prying, judgmental eyes?  The book Wonder, presents a young man, August Pullman, ten years old, attending middle school for the first time in his life.  Going to middle school can be compared to being thrown in an aquarium with a bunch of starving piranhas.  Auggie, who was born with a genetic disease, which consequently caused his face to be horribly deformed, has been home-schooled up until this point.  At first, when presented with the chance to go to school like a normal kid, he shies away, even though, all he wants is to be like every other kid.  Reluctantly, he agrees and starts the adventure of his life time, middle school.  With great courage, he navigates the often cruel world of pre adolescent  kids.  Along the way, he encounters prejudice, ridicule, and plenty of heartache.  Take heart, there are also plenty of shining moments as well: friendships, growth, kindness, change and hope.  How will Auggie learn to find his way in the halls of the middle school?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*August Pullman is one of those literary characters who will stick with me for a long time to come.  He is courageous, yet fragile; funny, yet sad.  A little boy just trying to find his way like any other, except he has a face that frightens everyone.  I loved that Auggie was able to open my eyes and show me what it was like to see the world through his eyes.  Granted, it certainly is not easy to be in his shoes, in fact often his tribulations had  me blinking back tears, but in spite of it all, he manages to tug at my heart strings and make me see things differently.  Yes, he is a sympathetic character, but he is so much more.  The author doesn't want you to spend the whole book commiserating with Auggie and drowning in sorrow.  Instead, she shows you the difficulties he encounters and makes you understand that people suffering from disfigurement want you to look beyond their scars and anomalies.  Take time to peer into their soul and see the beauty shining inside.  Of course, easier said than done.  I mean think about it, how often in your life have you encountered someone who is deformed?  Most of us are guilty of looking and then quickly shifting our eyes to something else, so we don't appear rude for staring, and then quickly sneaking another peek, undetected.  How often do you look them straight in the eyes?  Auggie is an excellent role model, he will make you laugh and cry, and most of all he will show you the extraordinary amount of courage it takes to be different.<br />*I was surprised going into this read, expecting a book that would tear my heart out, by being painful and heart wrenching, but it is filled with humor, as well.  Auggie will make you laugh as he has plenty of funny things to say.  Yes, numerous portions of the story brought tears to my eyes and one scene made me bawl, but it is an extraordinary read.  Don't pass this up because you are afraid of the weighty subject matter. Ms. Palacio does an exceptional job in taking a tough topic and making it easier to navigate.  This book is a surprisingly easy and entertaining read that will change you.<br />*This book opened my eyes to just how cruel, judgmental and prejudiced people can be.  Of course, I haven't grown up with my head in the sand, but I was saddened by the nasty way some of the adults in the book handled Auggie.  I hope that this novel finds its way on every library shelf and school shelf for young readers.  Hopefully, we can all learn from this one small book and push to change public perceptions.  In a culture inundated and obsessed with beauty, we fail to see how vicious it can be for those who look different to live in thisperfection driven society.  It is time to teach our young people that beauty radiates in each and everyone of us, and that we all deserve to be treated with kindness, no matter what we look like.<br />And The Not So Much:<br />*I have only one complaint for this book, and that is it employed six different points of view.  I struggled a bit with the change of voices in the story, especially the first switch away from Auggie.  Several times, the transition was a bit jarring, for instance, the narration suddenly reverts to Justin, the boyfriend of Auggie's sister.  The reader was just introduced to Justin in the prior chapter and it was a hasty meeting.  The shift in narration might be a bit difficult for younger readers.  However, do not let this multiple view point style deter you.  Once I settled into each new voice, I could see the purpose.  Seeing things through a different pair of eyes, enriched the story.  There were several examples of misunderstandings and miscommunications throughout the story.  Viewing them from another angle was an eye opening experience.  The various narrators ended up enhancing the story, in that they provided their own unique experiences.  The reader is so wrapped up in Auggie's trials that they fail to see how others close to him suffer, as well.  I am glad the author included these alternate voices.<br />Wonder is one of those books that comes along and gets into your head, speaks to your soul and ends up changing you.  It will make you stop and reevaluate how you perceive others. Especially in this day in age where bullying is running rampant with the advent of social media.  Take some time to get to know Auggie and those closest to him.  Learn from their example and make a difference.  Perhaps, if we all make an effort to be just a bit kinder, the world would be just a little brighter.  I hope that you all will take time to read this phenomenal book and most importantly, share it with the young readers in your life.  I applaud Ms. Palacio for her efforts to change public awareness on this difficult topic.  Wonder will be one of those books that I will add to my life changing shelf, I hope you do, too.<br /><br />Favorite Quotations:<br /><br />\\"\\"But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds.  I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Here's what I think: the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way.\\"<br /><br />\\"I knew that people were nudging each other, watching me out of the corners of their eyes.\\"perfection driven society.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is really fun and addictive! you don't need the Internet to.play so its great when your on the road!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I don't watch much TV except for some PBS since I no longer have HBO.  I decided to see what the big fuss was about when some of my friends were discussing it, so I watched the first season on Amazon Prime.  I really didn't think I'd be that interested.  Once I started,I couldn't stop and watched the whole first season in one sitting.  I never, ever watched so many hours of anything, in one sitting before.  This is a must see show, especially for those of us of a certain age who grew up around the time the show is set in.  The acting is perfect, the story is so real and so is the setting.  You can't help getting involved in the character's lives and where the story is taking them.  Besides that, I loved seeing the fashions we used to wear.  Those were the days!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is great! There are a lot of great to choose from to play.. Give me more great games to choose from?? Anyways, thank's(:
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I could not put these books down and am recommending them to everyone I know. It's about time we had a decent sexually charged read without the smut and the mills and boon romance crap. I will probably read them again.  This is what life and love should be about! Great sex and intense love!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a cool game the only thing I have against it is that the directions don't make ANY SCINCE AT ALL<br /><br />bye
B005T87QCI|1.0|The game said that it takes 60 mb so I select some of my Apps and it still said that the downlowd failed  so don't waist you're money
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Not funny or even interesting.  The characters are weak, the writing is lame and the fact that they beat a good Teenage Fanclub song into the ground annoys me. Not worth the 1.5 hours.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I just ordered this movie last month.  We've watched it at least 3 times.  I have just been reading the other reviews and they have solidified for me something that is so hard to put into words.  This move is a comedy/adventure/romance, and does all three well.  We do not like slap-stick so rarely touch anything with comedy in any way related but this was a fun movie and you had to listen to pick up the good lines.  Anyone just wanting a fun relaxing time will enjoy it.
B0067FGYGQ|5.0|I'd never heard of the artist before, but saw it in a record bin (vinyl) and remembered it had been favorably reviewed, so I bought it. I loved it! Well conceived, written, sung, played, recorded, and arranged. An album that I want to play over and over. Cannot recommend too highly. Will now investigate her earlier work and await her future work.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app is incredible! It gives me everything I need to know in a small footprint. This app is fast (Weather Channel is bloated &amp; slooooow).
B002ZG98C8|1.0|As soon as I heard DeNiro trying to do a Texas accent I quit watching it. What was he thinking? Did he lose a bet?
B002KS1IJC|5.0|This is an very entertaining movie.  There is just enough suspense in the movie to keep it going to the end.  I would like to see them come with a outlander II because the first was so great.....but we need to have the same actors.  I liked the fact it was not all blood, gore and guts, and not all fighting.....and especially the fact that he was able to rebuild his life in the end with the beautiful princess.  I guess I still have a bit of the kid in me, but I felt this was a very good movie....with a good ending.
7883704575|1.0|The image quality is ok, but the sound quality was pretty bad. The volume is coming in and out, can't really hear the dialogue. :-(
B004YXE438|4.0|I really like this puzzle app.  The pictures are pretty and the puzzles have enough different levels (you can choose both the number of pieces and the level of difficulty) to keep the game interesting.<br /><br />I am taking off one star, however, because the other day I was notified of an update that was supposed to allow customers to purchase a Spring Expansion Pack--but the pack is not available in the Amazon AppStore yet!  C'mon, developer; get with the program!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|live it. it is a really good game and it entertained me a lot during my trip my friends are really Mad a me for playing this but I love it anyways
B007MDB71O|5.0|I really loved this film a lot, it just sucks we won't see a sequel to this awesome film because people much rather read critics reviews and all the bashing that's going on,  rather then see the movie for themself and decide. Great fun action filled movie. SEE IT FOR YOURSELF!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall this a fun games.  its cool to have the challenge of unlocking new games but it can get frustrating when you cant beat a game or have to save for a new game.  at least give this game a try you'll like it!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I have always loved the old school RPGs. I knew that this app would not dissapoint when I loaded it up and experienced the classic turn-style combat system and defined yet simplistic character design and execution that caused me to salivate with nostalgic pleasure.<br />I would advise anyone willing to go down memory lane to buy this application.
0439023513|4.0|The author gave up in the last few pages. Instead of an ending I feel like the door slammed in my face. The book made me long for characters I once knew, their mental instability never completely resolved leaving me confused. The end focusing on only Katniss's future disregarding the other charters ripping out my heartstrings leaving me with no closure, but a sickened stomach. The confusing twists, unexplainable motives never tied up just left as severed strings. The previous books left me unprepared for this. Although I deeply love the books the ending rattled my opinion. Everything about the series enlightened me, until the pages dwindled killing the torch leaving readers in a cave of questions.<br /> The book would shower in five start ratings without the vacant ending. Looking back the other books ended in similar ways, but a sequel followed, Mockingjay's ending should have been expected.<br /> Easy read, page turner, worth the nonexistent foreclosure. It is undoubtedly the best book(s) I have ever read. Possess something for all readers. I recommend a week for this series you won't be able to put down. Opens readers eyes to the emotions of war.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card is my new favorite author!  This book was so exciting to read.  The main character really came to life.  I have recommended Ender's Game to all my friends.  I'm an Ender fan now!!
0439023513|1.0|This has to be the worst final book in a series I have ever read. So sad and disappointing too because the first two books were so engrossing.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|I dont know if it was the best 3D movie, not to say that it was bad in 3D, but it would've been just as enjoyable in 2D.  Loved the movie though.  Fun for the whole family.  If this one had Donkey in it I would say it was better then Shrek... it was a close second though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes reading the Bible easy with many reading plans.  I read each morning while on treadmill with either Kindle Fire or Droid Razr.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It was a very good game the only thing I don't like about it is that it force's you to close.
0451209338|3.0|The Kill Artist is the first in what turned out to be a very successful series of espionage novels by Daniel Silva.  On its own terms it makes a satisfying though not exceptional read.  Read with the benefit of \\"hindsight\\" by readers already familiar with master spy Gabriel Allon and the wiles of the Israeli Secret Service, it has a different kind of appeal.  The newly minted Allon is, unsurprisingly, a little rough around the edges. His relationship with his boss, Ari Shamron, is less trusting and more adversarial than it becomes later.  It is almost as if they need time to get comfortable with each other as does the writer and his emerging fan base. Silva's approach too is gentler and more questioning, his set pieces less intense and in places rather over-written compared to his subsequent standards.  If you are after the action and adrenaline reading rush synonymous with Allon books, look for a later Silva offering. However, The Kill Artist still  has a storyline to interest and fresh biographical insights to add colour to characters and contexts fleshed out in later stories.

B004LROUW2|5.0|What a wonderful book!  Murakami outlines the ineffable with a resonance that only a master writer can craft. Reading this book increases one's sense wonder and sense of possibilities for this world in which we are living. The co-incidences in the book do not seem contrived but hint at the greater harmonies all around us. Love is at the heart of this amazing book.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is better than the original Angry Birds! It's simple, fun, and fans of the original game will love it. In this game the birds have new abilities and are ready to defeat the pigs once again. The gravity addition can be very fun!
B000H4QD1O|1.0|This is one of the most boring sci-fi shows I have ever seen; I couldn't even get through the 1st show. Not since \\"Starship Troopers\\" have I seen anything this bad.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|This movie didn't scary me one bit, but had everything else i liked. It had sexy girls, great story line, and great music! I thought at first I wouldn't like it, but it did surprised me. At first I thought it just going to be just one of those shows that throws fan service left and right at you but it's not like that. It's just the decent amount of fan service and a whole lot of great story and direction. I love these survival horror films too. I hope they come out with a second season. That would be awesome!
0385341008|5.0|I checked this book out at the library, and then listed to the BOCD. I finally had to have my own copy. There was a school teacher in our town that recently went to Guernsey. I may have to go myself.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Yes, this film surprised me. It was very entertaining and funny too. I thought I would just give my usual 2 or 3 stars going into this film. But no, it's definitely not that. It's a 4! It wasn't a 5, but it was close. It just needed to be a little bit longer and have a more detailed story line. It's still a good movie though.<br /><br />I liked how they made a lot of jokes and the actors didn't try to hard to make it funny. I like how there were twisted to how kids today are somewhat different than kids in the 90 let say. Example from the movie was that acting smart or being smart wasn't very cool back then. But, now it's seen as okay. Also, there was a part in the movie where Channing Tatum said he was wearing skinny jenes. Yes, today that is what the cool kids wear. ha ha But, back then, you probably just get beat up for that. Back then it was all about the baggy style jenes. The more baggy the better. I remember there was even a filing system like baggy, baggier, and baggiest! Very comfortable comparable to skinny jenes. ha ha<br /><br />I would had like the film to show more of what could had been and what else that happened. I would had liked to see Channing Tatum character develop more with the chemistry teacher. Also with Joah Hill character, I'd like to know if Hill could had keep on seeing the H.S. girl after graduating. Then, there was the situation with the H.S. boy that was friends with Hill character. What happened to him after he got caught? He just goes to jail and that's it? Shouldn't he got off a bit easier? He was lower level dealer and was con into selling the stuff by the supplier. Also he was friends with Hill character too.<br /><br />The movies gives off a open ended endding for the audience, where there could be a sequel or not. It works both ways and I'm find with it. Great movie. Watch it!

B000O8OTNC|3.0|This functional and handy tool is small and fits well with camping gear as a portable way to sharpen knives on the road. It does a good job, and sharpens dull pocket knives. This isn't going to give you the same results as a larger $50-150 sharpener, but given the size and cost it's very useful.<br /><br />This tool allows me to sharpen all parts of the blade and is very easy to use. I get better results with this tool on smaller knives that are can be difficult to sharpen with my larger diamond rotary disc sharpener (they don't fit into the larger unit very well). Be consistent in the angle you use when sharpening for best results. I can feel the carbide engaging the blade and got the hang of it quickly.<br /><br />Using the diamond rod to sharpen serrated edges takes time and care as expected.  I wouldn't risk using this on my higher grade knives.  I see this as more of a backup and emergency tool than a primary sharpening device.<br /><br />3 stars for a nice sharpener at a great price, but not nearly the results of a finer sharpening system.

By this time, anthropomorphic (\\"human-looking\\") robots are doing menial tasks for humans.  All robots have as their core programming the three laws indicated above.  But something seems to go wrong and a human is found dead.  (Not just any human, but a genius roboticist played by James Cromwell.)<br /><br />Enter homicide detective Dell Spooner (Will Smith who also was one of this movie's executive producers) who has to try to solve exactly what happened.  A robopsychologist (Bridget Moynahan) aids Spooner in his investigation.  (Believe it or not, even robots need shrinks.)<br /><br />Yes, this movie has plenty of action and special effects.  The action, though, is not mindless and I found myself pausing to think.  As well, the special effects were done well and did not take over the movie.  I liked especially how the robots interacted with humans.  (The technique used for the robots was \\"motion capture\\" and I found it to be quite effective.)<br /><br />As I said, this is an action movie that gives you pause to think or consider artificial intelligence and even what it means to be human with respect to such things as consciousness, uniqueness, death, having a purpose in life, free will, creativity, and evolution.<br /><br />This movie has good background music that aided each scene.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released Dec. 2004) is excellent in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good, futuristic sci-fi movie that causes you to think.

Going to watch the whole series again when we hear Series 3 is about finished!
B003EYVXVE|5.0|IN A SENTENCE: I really enjoyed the books, and felt the first movie did a great job of condensing the sensational and unconventional novel for the big screen.<br /><br />I saw the movie with my two grown daughters, and all of us are \\"Hunger Games\\" aficionados (I'm almost 60, and my kids are 27 and 30).  We all loved the movie, discussed the film as we drove home, and we found few real problems.<br /><br />First of all, the acting was terrific.  Jennifer Lawrence did a fine job capturing Katniss, though I didn't get the same feeling of anger perennially seething under her skin.  That bothered me, but my daughters had no problems there.<br /><br />I thought Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth as Peeta and Gale, respectively, were both terrific.  Gale's part was very minimal, but he was certainly the right actor for the part.  Peeta is spot on as the \\"doughy\\" baker whose lack of skills as a fighter are counterbalanced by his wisdom at assessing the politics necessary to survival.<br /><br />Lenny Kravitz was a great choice as Cinna, and I would have given him more screen time.  In fact, I was extremely pleased with the entire Capital scenes...their depraved innocence, their stupidity, their love of spectacle, their entire sense of action without consequence--I felt Director Gary Ross and his compatriots did these scenes justice.  Donald Sutherland as President Snow, Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman and Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane--all accurately cast and cleverly played.<br /><br />Willow Shields was fine as Primrose, but her role did not ask for a lot in this movie.  I believe the reasons they picked her will become apparent by the third movie.<br /><br />There was not too much to complain about here: Understandably, the book did a far better job at getting into Katniss' head, especially when it came to the relationship she had with Peeta.  It's there, but her struggles with her feelings are not detailed, and because of that I would guess that those unfamiliar with the novels will not catch on to the problems she had with authenticity of her feelings.<br /><br />Also there, but decreased, is Haymitch's drunkenness.  He is still a drinker, but it presents nowhere near the impact here that it did in the novel.  He overcomes his dependency rapidly, almost as if it is simply an affectation and nothing more.<br /><br />I didn't think they did justice to the role of Katniss' mom, played by Paula Malcomson.  This is especially true when it came to the period of mourning after her husband's death when she \\"checked out\\" mentally and left her kids to survive on their own.  It was mentioned, but I do not believe it was not choreographed well enough for those who did not read the book to to gather its import.<br /><br />There are other significant changes, and many will have to be weighed as the movie's sequels move along.  One I'm interested in is the small change made concerning this movie's lack of follow up to the hovercraft scene witnessed by Katniss and Gale.  They showed the hovercraft, but there was nothing further in this movie...I'm hoping there might be a clever twist coming up.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear about this; I feel it would be too much of a spoiler to go into here.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is very faithful to the book, and it makes me really \\"hunger\\" for the sequels.  What will the setting of the second Hunger Game look like?  What about the bunker in the third movie?  What about the urban warfare in movie 4?  The sewers?<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to it all.guess that those unfamiliar with the novels will not catch on to the problems she had with authenticity of her feelings.<br /><br />Also there, but decreased, is Haymitch's drunkenness.

B0055PMJMW|2.0|These are three very short stories with very little flesh on the bones. I was not familiar with Harry before and as such didn't get much of a chance to get to know him in these short sketches (hard to call them stories). This is as much an ad for the next book as it is these stories. I didn't lose much money or time, however.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I give E.L James credit, I really was skeptical about reading this book but I am soooo glad. I admit it starts a little slow but man it heats up fast....Christian Gray is the tormented, insanley sexy, character and in no way like Edward Cullens (thank God) and Ana is actually very likeable, nothing like whinny Bella from Twilight. So like I say it may not be your cup of tea but give it a chance I know my friend didnt really like the first one but man she has finished the series and loved it! as do I
0525478817|5.0|I cannot stop thinking about this book. It is one of the best books I have read in a very long time, and I wish it kept going on and on. I just finished it 2 days ago, and Im re-reading it already.<br />Nerdfighters forever!
B0013FBS20|4.0|First of all, picture quality is top notch. Excellent BluRay transfer.  The CG which I thought looked so poor in the movies actually doesnt look half bad in BluRay.  Not sure if the studio remastered the film during transfer to BluRay but the movie looks way better than I remember.  I really enjoyed the scenes of a deserted NYC and the alternate ending is an interesting twist for a zombie flick. For some reason I enjoyed this movie more in BluRay and on my wide screen LCD than I did in the theatre.

B000Y7U98W|2.0|The good - great visual effects and BluRay transfer. The Bad - this movie! 1) First of all, restarting the sun with a nuke? I dont think so 2)If your going to send a nuke the size of Manhattan into the sun, send it on an unmanned ship. Makes way more engineering sense. 3) Ok, so if your going to send a manned ship with a nuke the size of Manhattan to restart the friggin sun and thus save the earth and human race, pick a professional, believable crew. One would think that with the fate of mankind, hanging in the balance, Earth could pick seven professional astronauts.  These guys whine, squabble, fight and make one bad decision after the other.  They do not act like astronauts or even boy scouts.  No worries, one member of the crew is a Psych Officer. My teenage son driving while talking on his cell phone could make better decisions than this crew.  4) The slasher elemement in the second half pushes this borderline flick over the border. Mr. Director, what are you thinking?  But the movie has some therapeutic value, it puts me to sleep every time.  Ive had to watch it at least 5 times to get through it..
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|First thing's first: if anyone complains about TOO MUCH SKIN, they are not culture savvy in the slightest. There are reviews for this movie that focus on that one detail and nothing else.<br />Now for the good stuff. My brother and I watched this and had a great time enjoying. My bro almost thought it was a Disney movie then realized it was better (at least in terms of today's Disney flicks). I couldn't help but notice all the beautiful cinematography of the exotic locale and angles of surfing.<br />The shark attack was real quick compared to what I was expecting, yet it did its part well enough for the speed to be a nonissue.<br />The church sequences (yes, there's a couple of them) at first may seem preachy to some, but what made it different (aside from a country singer for a youth pastor) was it being an open-air beachside church. Very, very different compared to the closed walls of American churches. Then there's the competitive surfing. Long before I heard of Bethany Hamilton, and despite being city-raised, I'd hoped to try surfing out. Haven't got a chance yet, and this urging me to try even more.<br />Besides the competitivity and Christian spirit throughout, there's a showing of the effects of civilian PTSD, social persecution for physical disabilities, media hunger for stories (no matter who they may end up hurting), mean-spirited competitive opponents... yet there's also hope, a teenage spirit of striving in spite of how others think they should go about anything, helping the helpless (never knew Bethany Hamilton went to Thailand to help tsunami survivors), and families striving togethet, blood-related and not. I even appreciated that it didn't show Christians to be incessantly happy-go-lucky even in the midst of tragedy right after listening about God having a plan for us, but showing confusion at it all (\\"I don't know how God could have a plan after this! What good could possibly come from this?\\"), showing a lot of realism (the very gritty kind) alongside practicality.<br />Humor, tragedy, hope, realism, love between one another, seeing things differently. This is my kind of Christian movie- even with a PG rating, it pulls no real-world punches.de practicality.<br />Humor, tragedy, hope, realism, love between one another, seeing things differently.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|This book, despite its unwieldiness, was thoroughly entertaining. The character of Kaladin was moving and beautifully rendered. Szeth, from the little bit of perspective he gives, is intriguing and catching. However, I am left wondering at Shallan. Though I see her as a very good character, complete with a charming, if self-depreciating, sense of humor, I cannot discern any relevance she has to the story.<br /><br />Since this IS Brandon Sanderson's story, I have to suspect some grand plan involving Shallan. If it was not for Shallan, I would have given this book a five. To tell the truth, I would have given four and three quarters stars, but that is impossible.<br /><br />I most definitely recommend this book to anyone who has the time to read it. I do not care whether you prefer thriller, horror, or (God forbid!) romance, this book will catch anyone's attention.

B007MFLFMI|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first heard about this project. Well, they nailed it.  Even if you're not a techno/trance kind of fan, this album makes it very accessible, without losing its edge, which is a tough feat to pull off.  Dark, yet upbeat at the same time, and down right addictive. I've had it in constant rotation on my play lists.  Lets hope they continue recording together.<br /><br />Hands down, a four star album, so get it already.

And I strongly believe there needs to be a drastic change in North Korea: from basic human rights to a change in their wicked government.<br /><br />-Kevin

1612130283|3.0|This book reads a lot like a Harlequin romance in that there isn't character development or even a real story.  It's basically a very detailed description of a naive young woman's first affair.  The writing isn't great.  At times it was frustratingly childish in its narration.  That said, when I finished, I decided to order the 2nd and 3rd books in the series.  The ending was a bit abrupt and left me with a curiosity about where the story was headed.  Or maybe it's because I think there has to be more than what was included in the first book. I gave it 3 stars because it did intrigue me to some extent.  2 1/2 would be more accurate.  I'm not thrilled about the writing or story, but it's an easy read and will provide a distraction or escape from the everyday.

B005T87QCI|1.0|Hey, I didn't buy it but I did read some of the reviews for this app. Here are two major things that I've gathered so far: first and maybe most importantly the simple fact that atom and zeus are not even options, unlockables, or update-then download to get them later. Like, really? Second thing was that the game is too short. Now I cannot speak from experience of the game because I have none. But I put great faith into my fellow gamers  reviews. And if this game lacks even just those two major things , then why bother with it..oh and I forgot to mention that I read the controls are not smooth -bad stuff.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|just real happy with how this game is laid out. free games to play for and the option to buy games for a couple of bucks if you are ina hurry. grandikids played this for hours in the car on a 2 day trip.

0470474874|5.0|A splendid resource. It does it exactly what I wanted it to.<br />Unlike some excel guides it doesn't just slightly rewrite the help index.<br /><br />It is well written and easy to understand. It covers all aspects from the very basics to the more advanced stuff.  The chapters on VBA were especially good. After reading them I have begun to be able to do some basic VBA programming.<br /><br />Like a lot of books from this publisher it does have slightly cheap feel to it and I didn't like the grey colour of the text.<br /><br />The CD that accompanies it is very useful and all the examples seem to be accurate.<br /><br />I have found this book to be immensely helpful and having a copy of it can make you the \\"excel expert\\" in your office.
0439023513|3.0|In the first two books I was annoyed by the trite notion that the rebels were the good guys and the Capitol was the bad guys. She really bursts that bubble here. It quickly became apparent that 13 was in it's own way as twisted and wrong as the Capitol. Katniss was interestingly and probably realistically resigned to the fact that she was sacrificing her life and those of her friends and family for a future that was not necessarily going to be better. In the end she was able to make some compromises and end up in a world marginally improved. The fact that most bloody revolutions do not end up in improvement in the lives of the little people is not lost here. She ended up broken and struggling to put a little something back together in her life, to salvage something from the wreck of her life.<br /><br />Very good series.
0807014273|4.0|I found this book to be deeply moving.  The first section where he describes his time in a concentration camp and the ways that he and his fellow inmates attempted to cope with the terrible conditions , is extremely good. It is well written and though maybe not quite in the class of Primo Levi it is still one of the best biographical works on this subject that I have read.  It is extremely inspiring.<br /><br />The second section of the book mainly describes his \\"logotherapy\\" theory.  It is very interesting and I can see that many people would get a lot out of it but I was not entirely convinced by it.  Finding your own personal meaning to life is probably extremely beneficial to you but I don't think that you can entirely prove or even disprove that there is an ultimate meaning to life.<br /><br />Despite this small reservation I thoroughly recommend this book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app! my husband teases me about all the lists I make. Now when I think of something in the middle of the night I don't have to turn on the light to write it down, I just enter it into my Kindle fire. I can access my lists anywhere - computer, Kindle, iPhone.
B004PGO25O|2.0|It is very good of the author and Seth Godin to offer this for free on the Kindle.<br /><br />Many people have found Steven Pressfield's book \\" The war of Art\\" to be very useful in overcoming resistance or procrastination and \\" Do the work\\" is basically a distillation of that book.<br /><br />I do have very mixed feelings about his approach.  For overcoming writers block I have found it to be somewhat useful . Even successful and prolific writers sometimes have problems and seeing this resistance as something to be fought and overcome can be quite helpful.<br /><br />However I did find the writing to be overwrought, self-dramatising and often very inconsistent. Also it seemed a bit too personal to the author.<br /><br /> I have found  books that give far more practical advice to be a lot more useful. Pressfield's approach only seems to deal with one possible reason for procrastination.<br /><br />The psychologist Albert Ellis in his Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy approach has a lot of methods to deal with \\"Low Frustration Tolerance\\" (which seems similar to resistance) and these seem to be much more useful than the mystical approach that book uses.<br /><br />For areas other than dealing with a writer's block I think that his ideas might actually be harmful and de-motivating.  He makes everything seem really difficult and not really enjoyable.  It hardly makes you want to start work on a potentially difficult project!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the best games that is on the market, I personally LOVE it, and u should listen to what I say, because I'm an awesome person. I aggree with the dude that said, &quot; awesome app, for awesome people&quot;. The only problem is that the updates come SOOOOOO SLOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had the app for a day and had already gotten through with all the levels, boo='( And for you people who have problems downloading this app, you might not hag any money in your account, did u ever think about that as being one of your problems? Anyway, good luck ti every one who has problems and this is a really great app, u should buy it.
1401203078|4.0|I really liked this but I can see why some people are disappointed in it, there is perhaps a lack of the graphic element for a graphic novel.<br />I liked most of the stories here and they tended to be up to the usual League of extraordinary Gentleman standards, though on occasion the sly wit perhaps overwhelmed the story telling element. Jimmy Bond was a great pastiche as was Hugo Drummond.<br /><br />The combination of Jeeves and Wooster and Cthulhu was inspired but some of the short stories such as the Fanny Hill weren't quite as good.  Sometimes it was pretty hard work to work out all the various references to other fictional characters.<br /><br />The 3-D part at the end was superb.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I personally didn't like this app, and as far as it being like Temple Run, it doesn't say anything about that, so get over it people! But for serious though, this app really needs to be updated with a tutorial and maybe a hint guide, I don't know, that would really help. Oh and people, if your're just gonna get on here and write about wanting your money back, just call Amazon and as them {nicely} to give you your money back. Its really not that hard.
1576754227|2.0|This basically seemed to be telling the reader what they already know.  The idea of doing the most difficult task first is often (but not always) a useful one. Breaking tasks and projects down into smaller and more manageable chunks is again good, but you hardly needed to read this book to know that.<br /><br />This can give you a bit of inspiration when you first read it but that is all. There is very little that is original or particularly useful here.  All these time management tips have been around for quite some time. Though it is to the author's credit that he doesn't claim that they are original to him.<br /><br />This book is extremely short and it is written in an easy to understand style and is a very quick read. However it does often ramble a bit and does seem somewhat padded.<br /><br />The practical usefulness of this book seems quite limited to me.  If people could do the most difficult tasks first, they would already be doing so. It focuses too much on the outcome and not on the behaviours that you need to carry out in order to get to that outcome.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|This is a VERY important review!!!!!!! If you are about to buy this app.....DON'T!!!!!!!!I'm telling you its the same thing. just don't buy this app!!!!!!!GET THE FREE VERSION INSTEAD, MUCH BETTER AND DID I MENTION.IT'S FREE???!!!!!!!!
0143121421|5.0|This certainly deserves its reputation as a modern classic. La Carre has succeeded in writing an intelligent, thoughtful and creative thriller that is also a real page turner.<br /><br />The introduction by William Boyd is interesting but it will spoil your enjoyment if you read it first.<br /><br />It is amazing that this book was written in 1963 and can still be read with pleasure in 2001 and without seeming anachronistic.<br /><br />It is extremely atmospheric and there are plenty of interesting characters. The central character of Alex Leamas is very well observed, partly an embittered cynic and partly a hopeless romantic.<br /><br />A slight criticism that I have heard is that the plot by the British secret service is too clever and slick and that in reality everything was a lot more amateurish.  I am not certain that I really agree with this criticism. I thought that the whole book was very well judged and it certainly seemed pretty true to life.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|My Review:<br />This is the first book that I've read by Sylvia Day and I wasn't really sure what to expect.  WOW!! After reading Bared To You, Sylvia Day has a new fan and I have a new favorite author!!  I loved, loved, loved this book.  Right from the start it grabbed me and drew me in and still hasn't let go.  I finished it in one sitting, I just couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the Gideon and Eva right from the start.<br /><br />Bared To You is the story of Eva and Gideon (great name for him). The story is told from Eva's point of view and I only wish that I could have heard it from Gideon's also.  They are both extremely attractive and are instantly drawn to each other, but neither is looking for a relationship. Eva has just moved from San Diego to New York with her roommate.  It is when she goes to her office building for the first time, that she runs into Gideon, literally, and their lives are forever changed. They each struggle with their own internal demons, insecurities, and past hurts.  Through the story, each tries to overcome their issues as well as help each other.  I love that Sylvia Day wrote these characters as not perfect, they both unintentionally made mistakes that hurt the other but they tried to learn from them and build on their relationship. Sylvia Day shows that relationships are hard and they take work and compromise from each person involved.  It is not always sunshine and flowers, but when two people are meant to be together, it can be amazing.  And their story is absolutely amazing, so much more then I expected and I loved every second.<br /><br />I fell in love with Gideon, he is the ultimate Alpha Male, he says the best things to Eva.  It was a good thing I read this on my Kindle, because in paperback I wouldn't have been surprised if the pages melted!!  It has some of the HOTTEST, STEAMIEST, INTENSE, SEXIEST sex scenes that I have ever read!!<br /><br />Eva and Gideon are perfect for each other and you can't help but root for them on their journey towards a happily ever after.  There is a great entertaining cast of secondary characters that have me hoping for their happily ever after as well.<br /><br />Silvia's website states that this is the first book in the Crossfire series that follows the emotional and romantic journey taken by Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell.  Bared To You is an excellent start to the series.  I am definitely along for the ride on Gideon and Eva's journey and eagerly await the next book.  I highly recommend this book. It is absolutely a reread for me!!<br />BEST OF THE BEST RATING<br />Mariann at Belle's Book Bag [...]ds a happily ever after.

0143120530|5.0|This tells the fascinating story of an American journalist who only a year after covering the American memory championships actually competed at them.<br />This works as a piece of science journalism and also as piece of entertaining journalism.<br />He is a very good writer and it was even quite funny in places.<br /><br />There are chapters on historical memory techniques such as the memory palace and also on topics like Synesthesia, how to push past learning plateaus with deliberate practice, how useful is it nowadays to develop a brilliant memory and on savants etc.<br /><br />Some of it I had read a few times before, but he writes well so it was still enjoyable to read.  Some of was new to me, such as it is now possible to temporarily induce \\"savant\\" like abilities into people. The research he does on Daniel Tammet who has become well known as a \\"Savant\\" was truly fascinating.  It will be interesting to see how the story develops.<br /><br />There are lots on interesting anecdotes about his time spent with competitive memory champions and he seems reasonable  with his fairly cynical assessment of Tony Buzan and others who have made a lot of money through the self help industry.<br /><br />Occasionally you can tell that the book started out as an article and he seems too defensive over actually having devoted so many hours to training his memory.  There were too many references as to how Geeky it is. Maybe he is just playing to his audience and wants to be taken seriously as a science journalist.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and my biggest complaint would be that it isn't longer.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Super fun for hours.  Needs more levels and characters would recommend this to a friend now I'm just killing time till the pens win the cup
1401230067|4.0|John Constantine really is a great Character. He is a lot more complex than most comic book characters. Despite being immensely unreliable and often selfish he is still just about on the side of the righteous.<br /><br />This is a reprint on the first nine issues of  the Hellblazer series and also includes a couple of Swamp thing issues where  he also features.<br /><br />The Hellblazer comics are a lot of fun. The storylines are interesting and it is interesting seeing how much social comment there is.<br />The narration doesn't always work especially when you compare it to the work of Alan Moore but the dialogue is mostly very good and often quite funny.<br /><br />The artwork does quite a good job. It isn't brilliant but it does quite suit the ethos of the comic book.<br /><br />The Swamp Thing comics are a little strange and don't really tie in that well to the actual Hellblazer comics and at this late remove, more than twenty years after publication, it will probably be hard for new readers to know what is going on.<br /><br />However I really did enjoy reading these stories again.
0441013597|5.0|So I decided to read the top 20 Sci-Fi books as rated by numerous sites. Enders Game ( the whole series), Time Machine, Stranger in a strange land,<br />American Gods,Asimov, Arthur C Clark. You name it.<br />  This was my favorite of them all. My list of 20 best books would have this at #1.<br />That being said, I then continued to TRY to read the rest of the series , and it was horrible.<br />  It was like, initially , the , story flowed from the author, to its end, almost magically, if you know what i mean.<br /> But the rest of his books, didn't flow, but , rather seemed forced, as in, \\"I've got to write more books\\". Either for the money<br />or public demand, I dont know, but I read half of his next two books, and changed authors. Just saying.<br />  Definately read this book. You can try the rest, AND you may like them, books are a personal preference thing after all, but dont be dissapopointed<br />if like me, it just didn't work for you.
0470913029|5.0|This contains all the information that you will need to go on a \\"Paleo diet\\" This basically involves lean meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. You should avoid grains, legumes, starchy food, dairy, highly salted foods, sweets and other processed foods.<br /><br />This diet is supposed to replicate the diet that we are evolved to eat. Agriculture is a relatively late development and we are much better eating a similar diet to one which we ate for hundreds of thousands of years.<br /><br />I have tried this diet and for me some big reasons why it works is a reduction in calories and also I don't feel hungry all the time which I normally do on most diets that I have tried.<br /><br />The author is an academic scientist and a lot of this is backed up by evidence.  Where he is speculating he says so.<br /><br />You can try the Paleo diet on your own without purchasing any books as a lot of this information is available for free on the internet. However I still found this book to be very useful. He details a lot of the scientific reasoning behind this diet and there are quite a few recipes and eating plans.<br /><br /> There are plenty of useful lists on the acid or alkaline contents of food and the omega- 3 and omega-6 balance of various foods and other similar subjects.  Admittedly there were some rather pointless lists of fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />There are possible ethical objections to this diet on environmental grounds and not wanting to eat animal flesh.<br /><br />I would thoroughly recommend this diet for weight loss. Also unlike some of the low Carbohydrate diets it doesn't restrict eating fruit and it also pays attention to not eating too much fat.
0812550706|4.0|Amazing book , unbelievably well authored, lots of action. I would have given it 5 stars but saved that for the next 3 in the series. WARNING. The next three in the series, dont have near the action-packed excitement of this first, but they got into such greater depth, into the personal characters  and the story, I didn't need the action, the story itself took over. I know some have read this and then were dissapointed in the rest of the series , and I can understand. Its a personal preference thing. If you need the action thing, Starship Troopers by Heinlein would be an excellent addition to this reading. If you want to get into a deeper, more philosophical look at the characters,and story,  finish the series.<br />  I tell everybody that I believe Cards main goal was to author books 2,3,and 4, to get his personal message across, ( which is obviously hidden in his writing). Book 1 Enders Game, I equate to the \\" grabber scene \\" at the beginning of a movie to get your attention, which it surely does. And if you only see the first, exciting 15 minutes of the movie and love it, then great. But you may or may not like the rest of the movie. Just saying.

0060558121|1.0|So I decide to read the top 25 rated sci-fi books of all time. Enders Game, the whole series, Dune, all of Heinleins stuf, Asimov, Arthur C Clarke. etc etc etc. This book is well written. The author is obviously talented, but the whole story never \\" jelled\\" . By page 350 I was trudging through it<br />expecting the last 100 pages to be so phenomenally plot twisting, to make the first 300 pages worth it. But it never happened. It fell flat on its face.<br />Usually when i read a good author I crave to try more of his stuff. I will avoid Gaiman , if only because of the book. Sorry.
B000I2J6K0|2.0|I am 10 weeks pregnant with my second child. Prior to finding out I was pregnant I worked out everyday. When I work out I am usually using dvd's. I also incorporate running, walking, and chasing my two year old. After finding out I was pregnant I was determind to find a challenging workout that would compare to my pre pregnancy workouts.  After reading the rave reviews regarding this workout I thought I had found the workout I was looking for. I will say the workout itself is not bad...but THE PRODUCTION IS HORRIBLE! The instructor takes several \\"pee breaks\\" and pauses foor water. Although some may find this comical I do not. I am quite able to pause the dvd on my own for breaks. I need a quick challenging workout that doesn't waste my time. I also purchased \\"body by trimester\\" and absolutely LOVE IT! The \\"perfect pregnancy vol 1\\" will be arriving on Tuesday. Let's hope I have more success with that order.
B005USZML4|1.0|Grisham books are usually well thought out and suspenseful.  This book however was not.  After plodding through the first half of the book I skimmed until the end.  The conclusion explains how the initial mystery, really wasn't a mystery at all - just poor parenting.  A disappointing read.

B004SBQGHS|3.0|I loved the whole idea of this version of Angry Birds.  I dove right in and mastered the first two levels, now to unlock level three I find out you need to master, get 3 stars on all games on the first two levels. So I am struggling to do that, and have come pretty far, but there are some, that for me anyway, will be impossible to get all 3 stars...sorry but I think a pro would have issues with that.  On some of them I even got all the pigs with one bird and still do not get 3 stars, what else would i need to do???  I paid for this game, looked forward to it, and now just struggling and ready to give up on ever achieving the 3 stars needed in everything to advance to the 3rd level.

0375703861|4.0|Ordinarily, reading a 400-plus page novel would drive me back to the bookshelf to choose another but this book is so gripping in the way it softens the most ponderous parts with humor that I will not rest until I reach the last page.
0812992792|5.0|\\"...they lived in a land where people had been trained to accept any reality presented to them.\\"  This in a nutshell is North Korea in \\"The Orphan Master's Son.\\"  Generations of North Koreans have been so thoroughly indoctrinated, brutalized, and isolated from the world that they have almost been turned into an alien civilization.  While reading the book, I had to keep reminding myself that it was not science fiction, but was based on an actual nation and its people. It is extremely difficult for free people to identify with the routine and pervasive dehumanization, torture, and want of North Koreans. But we must try so that we can understand the nature of the dictatorship and the threat it poses to the rest of the world. This was an extremely profound and disturbing book, and one that I will remember for a very long time.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I felt like I was reading a story written by a 15-year-old girl who hadn't even kissed a boy yet. The cliches in this \\"book\\" will make you want to vomit. The storyline is very stale in a copy-paste kind of way. The characters are flat and uninteresting. I read a lot of erotica, and let me tell you that this \\"book\\" makes those cheap 99 cent ebooks look like master work. You think Meyer is the queen of poor grammar? Think again.<br /><br />This book is absolute garbage. If you're looking for a quick thrill buy some of those free erotica ebooks. If you're looking for romance buy a Jane Austen book. Don't waste your time and money on this trash.

Distinctly Yes, distinctly unique, distinctly contemporary.  Classic Yes (sorry, just couldn't think of a better way to put it).  My personal preference on this one is to go start to finish, not missing any of the tracks as they intertwine amongst each other, have a common theme.  My 11-year-old son, on the other hand, prefers to jump right to Track 4 (he has autism:  he has this thing with obsessions).  Love, love, love it!  My favorite is Track 6, though there's nothing I don't love about the entire disc.  Thanks once again Yes for timeless, timely art.
1612130607|1.0|Seriously. There is nothing erotic about this book. This book should not be in the erotica section. And there is no fetish here. Any one who says this is a fetish book is a LIAR. I swear the book, if you can even call it one, was written by a 12-year-old girl. Don't bother with this garbage. Save your time and money. You wont find cheap thrills or a compelling story here.

1441737499|5.0|I purchased this two part story on my Ipad. I loved the stories so much, I wanted everyone to experience the story as well. So I purchased the CDs so I can play it in my car and let friends borrow it.<br />This is a unique story that is told from the view of the Rabbit. The descriptive writing is thrilling. The Rabbits talk and make decisions together and go on an adventure of a life time. I have listened to the stories eight times through and laughed every time.I will restart the stories again very soon. One is really at a loss if you miss this adventure.

B004IHE2B4|3.0|Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Amazon but it the case of LEGO's it's almost always better price wise to buy direct from LEGO's own website.<br /><br />I bought the Maersk Train set knowing full well that it didn't come with power functions or tracks but I somewhat underestimated the cost of getting all the peripherals needed to get the train moving. When I bought set 7499 my hope was (I thought) modest. I wanted a continuous track in order to run my train. This would mean the flexible tracks would need to be able to curve 360 degrees. After I bought it I started doing some mental math and it quickly occurred to me that this wasn't going to happen. 16 flexible tracks would have to curve 22.5 degrees each to reach 360 degrees. In reality they curve a little over 5.6 degrees which means it takes 64 flexible tracks to create a complete circle which is exactly the number of tracks in set 8867. 7499 will only get your train to curve 90 degrees. Likewise set 7895 - City Switch Tracks contains 4 curved tracks which would also get you just 90 degrees. Only set 8867 is capable to creating a continuous tracks. The other two must be bought 4x which can get quite pricy.<br /><br />One alternative would be to just buy the Set 7938 - Passenger Train, You get 16 curved tracks and 16 flexible tracks. Also you get about $40 in power function supplies (based on LEGO prices, not Amazon prices). So all in all you get about $65 of tracks and power functions along with the Passenger Train itself for $130.00. The downside is the Passenger Train comes with the much cheaper AAA Battery Box (88000) rather than the significantly more expensive rechargeable Battery Box (8878) when paired with the charger itself (8887) will set up back $75 bucks. Wow.<br /><br />So I've gone way off on a tangent but the point is that set 7499 will not even come close to creating a continuous track. If you already have tracks and you want to add more then 7499 is a fine (if a bit pricy) option. I have heard complaints that the flexible tracks are a poor substitute for curved tracks because curving the tracks creates gaps on the outer edge which causes the wheels to slip. I can't say whether or not this is true and it might only be a problem on inclines. In that case curved tracks are still available in case you want a fancy corkscrew track as in the Polar Express.eard complaints that the flexible tracks are a poor substitute for curved tracks because curving the tracks creates gaps on the outer edge which causes the wheels to slip.

B002R5QPRI|4.0|It's hard to believe that Whitney Houston was only in her late 20's when this movie was made. In many ways, art imitated life. She was young, vibrant, talented, and yet somewhat innocent of the things going on around her. Her manager wanted to keep her in the public eye, regardless of whether it was good press or bad.<br />The movie's portrayal of the paparazzi was certainly tame, especially when comparing them to what they've become today. They're constantly looking for a moment when their prey is weak, or vulnerable. We're all human, and as such, we all make mistakes or poor choices at one time or another in our lives. But they (the paparazzi)literally place their prey under a microscope for all the world to see.  In that sense, it's amazing we don't see more of them (actors and pop stars) become alcoholics, drug addicts, or commit suicide.<br />Some people say it's the cost of being a celebrity.  I believe the reason is that the world is full of \\"wannabes\\" who at first want to emulate their idols. But when their idol is caught in a weak moment, they want them to pay for their betrayal. And this love/hate relationship is fed, in large part, by the media, just like Whitney Houston.  Even after death, Whitney is still fodder for the media, whether she was abused as a child, a victim of domestic violence, or whether her death was suicide, drowning, or a drug induced heart attack. Regardless of which it is, the tragic news is that Whitney Houston is dead, and the world has lost a wonderful singer and actress.  Fortunately for most of us, Whitney Houston will be remembered by the songs she sang and the characters she played, and her tragic life will disappear in the fog of our memories.

B0059XTUEK|4.0|This is a wonderful story of a very sad girl and an understanding boy. Colin didn't want anything from this famous actress but to be her friend. A warm and wonderful story that reminded me of what my mother told me about meeting Marilyn in the 50s while she was shooting the Seven Year Itch. My mother was a waitress working for Saverin Restaurant in Pennsylvania Station, NYC. When not shooting Marilyn would come to the restaurant, and sit at my mothers' station for coffee every so often. When my mother came home after the first day of meeting Marilyn she told me something that I could never forget. She told me that Marilyn was the saddest person she has ever met but at the same time very kind. A must see movie and one for the collection.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Comes in a small packaging and is easy to assemble.  After assembly and recordings, the playback is wonderful. I swear this microphone is great for speeches, podcast, video audio, Skype chats, and Steam chats. I even tried singing with it on to hear the playback. It sounded excellent to my ears. I would not write, \\"Definitely buy this for recording singers,\\" because there is likely better quality microphones marketed towards singers. However, I am clearly satisfied with how this microphone captured my voice. It is so inexpensive, it does not hurt to try it out but if you do not like it in the end for singing, you will still have a great microphone for chats, speeches, podcast, video audio, etc. I recommend this microphone.

B0054TVW04|4.0|Ferguson is a shameless pro colonialist. He argues in favor of some ideas that other intellectuals would be terrified to support because of their inherent political incorrectness and shortsighted simplicity.<br /><br />He also tends to gloss over several arguments that could be used as counters to his primary thesis. On top of that, some of his writing tends to be rather run on, and has a bit of a run on feel in places. When he is addressing the primary argument, the reasons for the dominance of western civilization, his book is incredibly interesting.  When he is trying to broad brush history and go off on tangents to prove points that seem peripheral to his primary thesis...his book is less interesting, even sometimes tedious.<br /><br />That being said, Civilization is a very, very, entertaining and interesting book, and some of the points Ferguson makes are rather convincing, even the ones that are completely and totally wrong.<br /><br />Normally, we as readers and as Amazon reviewers, and citizens of the internet(s) in general, tend to bash individuals as illegitimate simply because their opinions and views are not the same as our own. I think this book is a great example of why that pervasive ethos is so incredibly flawed. Because even by being wrong, or not exactly \\"right\\" per se, Ferguson makes a very well crafted argument that is intellectually stimulating to read and stimulates the formation of other ideas within the reader, even if those ideas are in opposition to the ones the author is attempting to further.<br /><br />For instance, he is one of the many voices who believe that the United States is in permanent decline, and that China will surpass the U.S. as the most powerful nation in the world. It's not really an original idea. He's only the ten millionth pundit to have furthered such an argument, and won't be the last. But reading his well argued rationale of this inevitable decline of the U.S. I realized how completely and totally wrong he/it is. The United States has faced challenges before that were greater (the depression, world war II, the civil war to name only a few) and overcame them. In fact when weighed against the greater scope of history, the recent financial crisis actually seems like small potatoes in comparison. Not only that, but the U.S. is in a better position to handle these challenges than it ever was before. He seems, along with all the others proclaiming the West's demise, to be a victim of getting caught up in an intellectual fashion that will unfortunately turn out to be woefully incorrect. If the West does nothing to answer the challenge of the East, then it will certainly decline, and fall to the great powers of the orient. But isn't it foolish to make such a prediction before the U.S. and it's allies even have a chance to answer that challenge? Isn't it a bit like calling a game before it even starts? Part of me even feels like, as a brit who lives in a nation that has seen its own empire collapse, Ferguson is rooting for America to undergo a similar fate for no other reason then to not have to confront American superiority over Britain. It always seems to be about keeping ones nose firmly upraised when it comes to these guys, but no matter.<br /><br />He also seems to fail to acknowledge that the rise and fall of civilizations is never so dramatic or final. Society's go through various times of prosperity and decline. The line graph is always moving up and down in ever small increments, rather than a precipitous and permanent nose dive or accelerated and uninterrupted rise. Downfall just doesn't work that way, even though the macro view may give that appearance.<br /><br />All of this is food for thought, and above all, that's what \\"Civilization\\" provides. It churns up a lot of thought about a lot of different things. It is a good book for that reason, even if it is not completely correct in all of its reasoning. A well argued and entertaining argument is hard to find, especially one so relevant to the present situation. I say buy it, but only if you can live with not having to agree with it.

0439023491|3.0|The series in its entirety is amazing, but I do not understand why this book was so rushed, especially at the end!  If only Suzanne Collins would have taken another 15 or 20 pages to lay out the final events in the arena, it would be less of a disapointment.  I read this on my kindle, and when I was 95% complete, I did not know how the tale would come to an end so soon, because everything was still not settled in the arena.  Taking a bit more time to lay out what happened and why would have improved this book so much...

0439023513|5.0|Honestly, this book is probably the best book I have read in a long while.  Suzanne Collins brilliantly created the world of Panem.  While the story certainly has a love triangle throughout the entire series, it is not overwhelming and the reader never has to struggle to remember what the real issue at hand is.  The series is wonderfully developed, perfect timing and writing that leaves the reader clinging to the next words on the page.

B004T2QZL8|2.0|Doodle God has potential to be a good game, but is riddled with some serious flaws.  First and foremost, there are some major bugs in the game.  The music has crackles (for lack of a better word), but far worse, the game freezes and even crashes frequently.  This is completely inexcusable given the game cost an above average $2.99!<br /><br />Programming issues aside ( if you're able to overlook that), the game play is initially fun and addictive.  You play by combining items to create new items.  However, this can become tedious when you have dozens of items that can be combined.<br /><br />As it is right now, the game gets a generous 2 star rating (1.5 would be more fitting).  With the current bugs and simplistic (and eventually cumbersome) gameplay, I wouldn't recommend downloading it for free let alone paying $2.99.

B003EYVXTG|1.0|I know this movie got great reviews and I was looking forward to watching it. I was so turned off by the dragging story line. A 17 year old girl who is put upon to take care of her two siblings and wacked out non verbal Mother. The girl wanders all through the woods going to different homes mumbling about looking for her Dad, an apparent \\"crack cooker\\" whom we never see. She wants to prove he is dead so the family homestead is not lost.  The characters were played too flat no emotion, I kept waiting for the real story to start...... Disappointment!

0545405777|3.0|Every so often a book like Harry Potter, a movie like Titanic, a singer like Lady Gaga and a Broadway show like The Producers comes along and many are found talking about the book, film, etc.  For the last few months you'd have to be living under a rock not to hear the fuss made over The Hunger Games books or the film which took in over 155 millions dollars the first weekend it opened.<br />I never thought I would read the first book, The Hunger Games, since my reading taste doesn't includethemes about vampires, werewolves, unrequieted love or dystopian socoeities. But I just had to read the Twilight series since all of my students loved these books and wanted to know my opinion. I'm afraid thata sfar as that swreies went I much preferred the movies to the books.  And now that I've read the first book and saw the movie, I thought it was OK.  The message was brutal and I wonder what young people think about the premise and the violence.  For me The Hunger Games premise, the characters in the game or the violence endeared this book to me.<br />By now the subject matter is well known - how 2 young adults or children are chose from each of the 12 districts to fight each other to the death until one person is left standing.  In this case Katniss volunteers when her sisters name is called and Peeta are chosen.  They don't seem to get along all that well but the officials from the Capitol decided they need a romance to keep the public interested.  The book then shows how cunning thhese 24 young people must be in making alliances and staying out of areas that aer plagued by thun derstroms, dust storms and killer bees.  By the end of the book, when many have been killed a winner is declare and in a surprising twisat Katniss who does have some feelings also wonders about her true feelings for the boy left at home.<br />While I really found the Harry Potter books clever and fun and the characters memorable, I'm afraid I can't say the same for The Hunger Games.  Yet, I am determined to continue on and will now read the second book Cathcing Fire.mined to continue on and will now read the second book Cathcing Fire.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I was skeptical at first after reading reviews stating you could not use a card reader with the USB port, but figured, Hey, I'm not overly lazy to the extent that using a USB cord from the camera to my iPad would be too much work like some people seem to be indirectly implying. I have cameras with both SD and CF cards so I decided to spend 30 bucks and pick up the set.<br /><br />It works fine. Using an iPad 2 running iOS 5.1, I connected a card reader w/CF card inserted (a cheapo \\"iConnect\\" brand) to the USB slot and connected the device to my iPad. Import window popped up fine after a few seconds and I never had any messages stating insufficient power like I've been reading throughout these reviews.<br /><br />It's a shame that the current reviews are overshadowed by people all claiming to have issues which seem to now be a thing of the past. This product works to my standards and I am having no issues whatsoever.

B0068RHSZO|4.0|I wasn't really sure quite what to expect from Dream House when I sat down to watch it. My wife's description had been a bit vague.<br /><br />\\"It has James Bond and his wife and it's about this house.\\"<br /><br />All sort of true I guess. Anyway, I wasn't sure if I was getting a ghost story, horror story or what. Turns out of course it's a psychological thriller with a maybe supernatural element. The keep that cleverly vague and inconclusive. Which I liked.<br /><br />I actually love these sorts of movies where it's not quite clear who the villain is or even what exactly is going on. There is a huge twist part way through the movie. One that I sort of guessed. But even knowing it didn't spoil the enjoyment of it playing out. And even then it still wasn't completely clear who was good and who was bad.<br /><br />The photography really emphasized odd angles and shots through windows or from behind branches. That definitely added to the creep factor which was perfect for this sort of thing.<br /><br />I don't have a lot to say about the acting. It's a great cast, but really it's all about Daniel Craig and he is great throughout. Showing the entire range of moods of his character. Happy father, angry husband, scared, grieving. It's just an all round great performance.<br /><br />Really the only criticism I have is that the ending. The last three minutes really. Was weak and unsatisfactory. But despite that I'd definitely say watch it.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'll admit, right at the start, that this book is not for everyone - hence the lower reviews.  I'm enjoying it, however.  While it is hard to like Katniss, there is something about her story that I find compelling.  I am currently in the middle of reading the first book, and am interested in how everything pans out.  Yes I know how it ends as I looked it up on Wikipedia and I go nuts for spoilers, but (as I said) I'm enjoying the read and finding out how the story goes from point A to point Z.<br /><br />It's not as dull as some other books I've read in my time.
B002VECM6S|4.0|This was a very inspiring movie, and I really enjoyed it. It's always nice to see someone going from having nothing to having everything, especially when that someone is such a nice, gentle man who deserves it. Even if it was just because he was in the right place at the right time. In this case, he was homeless in the right place at the right time, which was a little different than usual. Sandra Bullock using that weird Southern accent took a little getting used to, but a third into the movie I almost managed to forget about it.<br /><br />The only annoying thing was all the college recruiting. It's so sad that good students - even students with straight A's - have to fill out tons of applications and pay tons of application fees begging for admission (and pay tons of tuition with tons of interest) while other students have the colleges begging them to choose them just because they have the skill to knock someone over on a field, or some such talent. Seems kind of skewed. (But that's how we end up with the millionaire sports stars while other Americans get by on $40,000 or worse, minimum wage.)<br /><br />In any case, I am glad it was a well-acted movie based on plot instead of a sports movie. Football tends to bore me, as do most sports, unless I am playing them. There were football scenes, of course, but they fit the plot and they were brief instead of overdone. After all, we already know he's a football star, so we don't need to see him win 16 games, right? Especially when they do that thing where the winning goal/touchdown/basket/point/whatever is scored in the last half a second. Like we haven't seen that a hundred times!
B000Y5JFNY|2.0|I ordered this package since I am traveling to Salzburg this year and will see all of these sites.

I called SONY and they said \\"sorry, read the box\\", which I did AFTER it arrived. When I called Amazon, they agreed that the product description did not convey the differences, but stated that I should have known by the number of Blu-rays and DVDs pictured that I would not get all of the special features on DVD.<br /><br />VERY DISAPPOINTED!
B004LWZW7E|4.0|I found that this movie left a lot to be desired (I agree with many of the flaws other reviewers commented on) but I still think it deserves 4 stars because of the social commentary prevalent throughout the plot. The world is such a hard place to live in, and the division between the rich and poor is disastrous. What made this movie so compelling is that, when time is the currency instead of paper money (or credit), everything becomes even more desperate. When the rent or some other bill is due and you don't have the time to pay for it, you don't owe someone or go into the red. You die. It really makes the concept of \\"running out\\" much more clear.<br /><br />One thing I found disturbing was the huge group of people that quit their jobs when they suddenly \\"came into\\" currency. One, if they're that irresponsible and spontaneous, they probably won't budget their time very well. Two, a good number of rich or well-off people think if they can make it, anyone can. And that is just not true. There always has to be someone left to do the menial, \\"unskilled\\" jobs. SOMEONE has to clean and do the dishes. Even millionaires' homes would become landfills if there were no garbage collectors. How could they buy the things they wanted without cashiers? They would starve without farmers. (I don't even want to mention those poor people who work in sanitation plants.) That is why EVERYONE deserves a living wage. Screw the minimum wage.<br /><br />And that's why this movie was so fascinating. People treated time exactly the way people currently treat money. Nothing had changed. The behavior of the rich hadn't changed. A good number of them went about their frivolous lifestyles having no idea what goes on on the other side of the tracks. The behavior of the poor hadn't changed. They worked day in and day out and never got ahead.<br /><br />I think the movie could have been more detailed and brought up a few more issues. Like most people, I think the way they \\"transferred\\" time was way too simplistic. Being able to steal someone's time simply by grabbing their hand is just silly. It made picking a pocket seem difficult. That was definitely the biggest flaw of the movie. I really didn't like what happened to the mother of the main character either. The fact that he missed her by like four seconds when he had a century to spare was just over-dramatic.oo simplistic. Being able to steal someone's time simply by grabbing their hand is just silly.

B005LAIH3G|1.0|I loved the John Carter series.  I also really liked the idea that this movie, and possible follow-ups, were intended to stay true to that series.  The Princess of Mars was a very good and exciting story as written by E.R. Burroughs.  How the writers of this film could have turned that simple story into a totally incoherent mess is beyond me?  The film is visually stunning so it makes this mess even sadder.  If you buy this DVD, just watch it with the sound turned off and you you are likely to enjoy the beauty, thoughtfulness and effort that went into its filming and special effects.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.  The writers should be ashamed of themselves for ruining what might have been one of the best science fiction movies in years.

It was great fun (always is) to read a book that is decently written that is set in locations you are familiar with. That aside, the plot was good, but wish Chris had limited the timeline jumps a bit more - or to at least 2 time frames - got a bit jarring after a while figuring out when and where we were. Additionally, had I NOT been almost everywhere he described - the descriptions were very consise - and while well drawn, and enjoyable while familiar, I thought it might be a bit thin for those who haven't visited the locations. Thanks for a good Read Chris.

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|There was a time, oh, from 50-60 years ago back to the beginning of film, when Hollywood regularly turned out smart, sophisticated, glamourous movies.  They were stylish and adult and entertaining.  Think \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" or \\"Casablanca\\" or \\"The Story of Eve\\" or \\"The Seven Year Itch\\" and you will know the type of stylish, sophisticated glamour I'm talking about.  Yes, there have been some newer ones that were similar to the old ones...\\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" for one, but they are far too rare.<br /><br />\\"The Tourist\\" is utterly beautiful from the first frame to the last.  It's a pleasure to see Johnny Depp being so endearingly appealing, and Jolie at her absolute most stunningly gorgeous best.  Sadly, this movie won't appeal to most of today's audiences because there's no gore, no CGI, no breakneck action, no foul language, no sex; in short none at all of the things most audiences go to the movies for today.<br /><br />The story needs no more talking about since so many reviewers have already outlined it, so, like I usually do, I will simply tell you why I like it.  It's a fun movie with humor, style, intelligence, elegance, romance, and lots of sophistication.<br /><br />No, I don't put it into the same category as a Cary Grant or Bergman movie, and, no, I don't think in 50 or 60 years people will still be talking about it.  It's not a classic.  But it is well worth the time and money to see it, own it, and watch it several times.  It's a lot of fun.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I basically love the concept and the idea's that were attempted in this movie. It's a crying shame the trilogy will be killed by critics and folks who had no idea what the movie was about and didn't see it. Disney dropped the big one here and ruined by their marketing the John Carter of Mar's we all loved from those well read books. I read one critic that said it was a rip off of Star Wars and other space opera's. I assume the man had no concept that Carter is almost a 100 years old and was way before Star Wars ?? It's a fun movie and looked great !!! I admit the screenplay could have been tighter but they did try to stay honest to the history of this wonderful story. I have to wonder why they changed the name to John Carter , it should have been John Carter of Mar's or Barsoom if they were scared of Mars :) Watch the movie and damn the critic's, it's a heck of a lot of fun. Isn't that why we go to the movies after all ????
B00136Q784|3.0|The cd is jazzy/bluesy/rock jam session essentially imo. So songs like I dont know anything sound incomplete lacking lyrics but the music sounds kewl fans of Alice in chains harder music may want this mid paced track.  The rest is fairly blues and jazz influenced mostly, some of it sounding similiar but not the same as alice in chains mellower songs.  River of Deceit is the biggest hit on the cd and would of made a nice alice in chains mellow song or pearl jam for that matter has memebers of both bands including alice in chains lead singer.  Most of the rest of the album is an interesting first time listen you probly will not want to hear all of the songs again but will probly have a few favorites.  The album as a whole imo is a little weak but you could easily salvage some songs off it for your alice in chains playlist i took the first 2 i mentioned for mine but do listen to the others occasionally.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Before beginning the final book I decided to read a few reviews. Shortly after starting my first review I could see that the book was most likely going to take a direction that most readers would not appreciate, but still read on. I am so glad that I did. Although a few spoilers were leaked, I am so grateful that I did read a few. Having prepared for an unpredictable ending, I felt that the book took a serious turn for the worst in some places but in the end, portrayed a very realistic view of what can and often does happen to people after a war. I am very pleased with the way the trilogy came to an end. And as the reviewer that convinced me to read on said, if you are looking for a fairytale ending this is not the book for you, but if you are a reader that appreciates realism than you'll love this book.<br /><br />Thanks and Kudos to Suzanne Collins. I truly enjoyed reading Mocking Jay and read the entire book in less than 10 hours.<br /><br />Alexis
0385342063|4.0|This was another enjoyable Sophie Kinsella quick and happy read -- as always it's fun to escape with her thoughts.  I do enjoy her \\"Shopaholic\\" adventures a little more than this and hope there will be more of those.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Fabulous. Read the entire first book in one lazy Saturday! I found Christian Grey to be strangely sexy and intriguing. The book was impossible to put down. Ana and Christian's journey is tantalizingly twisted. Can't wait to read Book Two.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've wanted to read this series for awhile and with the approaching movie I read them with a three week period only on the weekends. I'd recommend this book and is appeals to all types of readers and I could feel what Katniss was going through with her struggles in this book and how her family especially her sister Prim meant to her.  I knew that she would eventually fall in love with Peeta and enjoyed reading all the books in this series.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I'm a sucker for a romantic film, and this one has it all.  I'm sure the lead actor is a heart throb, but all and all, everyone in this production is great, especially Michelle Pfeiffer as the wicked witch and Robert De Niro as the cross-dressing pirate.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoy most about this film is how it points out that we often look toward the wrong person for love or think we love someone who really isn't worthy of our love and all the while we are overlooking the ones who love us and really deserve our love.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i absolutly love the hunger games series it is the best book i have ever read i even have seen the movie . Intense and Dramatic.But when you read it &#34;may the games be ever in your favor&#34;
B0030IIZ4M|3.0|This video was for my daughter, but the way things are, my wife and I have watched it with her several times.  I get a little tired of the Pixar formula - similar Randy Newman music, lots of the same voices, similar chase scenes, but these Pixar films are good solid kids entertainment.  Pixar also weaves content into films to promote other Pixar films - the often repeated line from this movie (\\"To infinity and beyond!\\") also makes its way into the blooper reel on \\"Its a Bug's Life\\", and \\"Monsters Inc\\" shamelessly hawks Pixar toys (the fish, woody, and others).<br /><br />My biggest negative on this film is that it is more of a boy's movie than a movie for my daughter.  All the main characters are boys and the only memorable female role is Bo Peep who is trying to seduce Woody and at one point leaves lipstick kisses all over his face (not exactly a role model I'd like my daughter to emulate).
B004EPZ03O|2.0|Which Muppet movie exactly did all these glowing reviewers watch?  I take no backseat to any fan over the Muppets.  My family and I watched them almost without fail in the 1970s and 80s.  What an entertaining and fun TV series.  My wife and I have seen many of the Muppet movies since then, our favorite being the Treasure Island Muppet movie.<br /><br />But this latest movie flopped, and badly.  It wasn't funny, other than a few chuckles.  It lacked that offbeat wit emblematic of the Muppets of old.  Only the hobo scenes in the theater clicked.  The movie repeatedly pounded on the theme that the Muppets were washed up, faded, forgotten by Hollywood and their fans, etc. etc.  I'm sorry to say it, but with this kind of production these bleak comments will certainly come true.<br /><br />I could live with the movie's \\"be yourself, we're all one big family, we gotta make choices\\" gooey stuff if it'd been offered up with even just a whiff, a wink of sly humor.  Disappointing.  I hope another Muppet movie comes out--I'll watch that one for sure since I think of myself as a \\"muppetly man\\"--both to give the franchise another chance, and to let it avenge this current offering.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Our 20-month-old daughter has already watched it a dozen times, so it works on her level, but for the adults there is considerably more.<br /><br />This story is a clever parable about making rules to control the behavior of others, about closed mindedness, about home-schooling and fear of empowering children's imaginations, and about the dangers of living with blinders in a society where the worst seems impossible (makes me think of the global warming deniers).<br /><br />Jim Carey is very believable as Horton.<br /><br />I wonder when we are going to get \\"Horton Hatches an Egg\\" which is one of my childhood favorites.
B004XW6AGO|3.0|this is a fantastic read and you can tell it was beautifully written. If you're looking for a nice light read this definitely isn't a<br />good option this is a little on the heavy side and has some deep complexity to it. overall though if you're looking for a gold dystopian-esque book this will be great
B0001I562I|4.0|It seems a little dated - but nevertheless this DVD provides reasonably solid entertainment for the kids movie library.  Bla Bla Bla (20 words required)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this I learned so much.  I wonder if I put blank and blank together this might happen. Doodle God is the best
B007JCP8FE|5.0|One thing I like about Shinedown is the fact that each one of their albums has its own unique sound. Amaryllis is certainly no exception. It's not as hard as Sound of Madness was (personally my favorite Shinedown album to date) but is still an awesome album. I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it. The only bad thing about this album coming out is it reminded me just how awesome of a band Shinedown is and that it will be another 2 years or so until I hear more new stuff from them.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVE them and read all 3 in 4 days. I have never even though of re-reading a book but I will be re-reading all 3!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This book intrigued me due to the super high ratings and the unusual storyline. This is very well written, character development is excellent and I got a great picture of the atmosphere in which the story took place. This book continuously evolved with a new twist and turn in almost every chapter with a complicated yet easy to follow world that the author developed. I hope Ms Hamilton plans on making this a series!
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I was starting to think that Björk would never do-create powerfull and solid albums again after the annoying Medulla and the mainstream ridiculous Volta, so I was pretty unsure about buying this album, but I did it and I must say that it was an accurate idea.<br /><br />On this album, Björk offers a conceptual disc, with fresh and moderns sounds mostly electronic beats with the help of some new bands like 16Bit (awesome) and also, the fact that she made up some new music instruments and worked with different people from all the world<br /><br />This new release opens with MOON, a kind of ..ballad maybe? seasoned with kinda guittar sounds (or something like that) very experimental and nice, afterwards we find THUNDERBOLT, another experimental track but in this case with electronic beats and a little bit downtempo, such a nice anyways.<br /><br />CRYSTALLINE, which is the 1st single is the 3rd song on the album, and its also an experimental track with a very dirty electronic and produced by the dubstep duo 16BIT, by the way the end of the song sounds more like drum&bass than dubstep.<br />COSMOGONY: With a nice verse-chorus and an interesting topic, this song is also downtempo but very powerfull.<br /><br />DARK MATTER: This song has no lyrics, only feattures Björk whispering ....icelandic words? or rare words as always Björk uses to do in some of her songs, anyway.. I love the song, even when it isnt long (only around3.30 minutes) has a very atmospheric music, very very like ambient electronic and experimental, very misterious by moments.<br /><br />HOLLOW: A tribute to DNA, very rare sounds but pretty cool and with an atypical tempo, sometimes slow and suddenly extra fast, I enjoy that song<br />VIRUS is the next one, and the music reminds me to \\"frosti\\" that small instrumental track on VESPERTINE; in this case, seems like is the same sound and the lyrics are wonderfull. Is one of my favorite songs on the album together with the next one: SACRIFICE which lyric talks about a woman who says to her husband maybe.. that he must take another kind of behaviour with a young girl-daughter, I love the lyrics and also the sounds, you must heard the song cause Im not able to find an accurate word to describe the sounds.<br /><br />MUTUAL CORE: Is an electronic song, produced by 16Bit, which is donwtempo at moments and in the chorus turns dirty electronic, experimental and fantastic, is my favorite of the album.<br /><br />SOLSTICE is a ballad like Moon, and its precious and beautifull, perfect for close.<br /><br />--<br />If you get the deluxe version which comes in digipak, you´ll find 3 extra tracks:<br />HOLLOW-EXTENDED which is the same version but longer (as the titles says), DARK MATTER (alternate version) which is good, the music turns here like a mass sound, and NATTURA which is an aswesome track previusly released as a single promoting the importance of natture. NATTURA is an electronic song with dirty dirty and rude beats, almost industrial and with lyrics in Icelandic, you can understand a little bit if you speak norwegian or swedish..anyway, its an awesome track and the deluxe version worths the price for it.<br /><br />PD The artwork of the cd is Ok but nothing in special, Björk has so much better artworks on her previous albums and singles.<br /><br />Buy it, you wont be dissapointed, this album must be released after Vespertine...or maybe Drawing R.9 after Vespertine, and this at last.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I loved this mystery. Serious stuff happened in a light hearted way. Others told what this novel is about, so I won't repeat, but I'll try to convince you to buy this book.  I know I am reading a good story when I can't wait to get back to it, over and over, reading much to long into the night.<br /><br />For those of you who wonder, there are no sex scenes. There was a hint, but the reader is left outside the closed door, as we should be. There are plenty other books out there if that is your preference.<br /><br />There are a couple of visions, but this isn't a \\"paranormal\\" story.  The author writes in such a way that the whole story is very believable; so much so that I forgot there was an author.  It seemed more like watching a movie.<br /><br />I liked everything about this novel, and I give it my highest 5 star review.
B0072OFM28|3.0|What started off as a fairly interesting, entertaining (with depraved overtones) series, quickly sank into a steadily collective mire of impossibility.  There was some strain, I gathered, to try to cash in on the previous, and debatably laudable \\"Rome\\" series -- still bloody and depraved, no matter how you slice it, (but some of the characters did indeed carry a ghost of \\"character\\" within them).<br />Nevertheless, by the end of this latest go round, I desire no more.<br />The bared testosterone and sullied nymphos throughout were almost addictingly watchable.  But as time wore on, I found there is/was no one really there to barely even \\"like,\\" other than the cool and stately Spartacus lead, or the ever flash-flooding smile of Gannicus.  I think the writers are sick.<br /><br />In Spartacus, the sun never shines.  It is eternally wrapped in gray and brown and dirt and grit.  (Not even the Roman's houses are more than dimly colored alleyways, and cheery as a leper ward.)  And blood?  Bless the altars of sacrificial goats and rams, vampires would have had a field day with the leftovers.  Please tell me, in what way was blood spilled?  In trickles, in bruises?  Fool -- it is/was splurged, spewed, spit, chewed, laced, lanced, by the buckets, by the fountains, by the rivers: laved, spurt, splashed, poured, lathered, just all over the place, at almost every opportunity, and in such startling, wondrous Halloween ways... (those making horror films for centuries to come will be scratching their heads on how to overtop this one!).  So I think after this particular series ended, the next season will NOT catch me looking.  I've been bled dry, and soul-shriveled.<br /><br />And somewhere, I think the true spirit of Spartacus... is writhing.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|A really, really fun movie with a great (Kenneth B.'s witty performance of Olivier is wonderful.)  Just a surprise treat for me.

It's a solid addition to any Android phone. Happy browsing!
B007FH9GT2|2.0|Good film but had several points where the download / buffering hung for several minutes during the film and spoiled the watching experience.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This evernote app is very simple: it let's you take notes and organize them into particular notebooks. You may also take snapshots as notes with your phone's camera.<br /><br />The main aspect that makes this app so appealing is the interface. It's very clean and easy to use.<br /><br />The basic free version has 60 kb (kilobytes) of space. That's good enough for typed notes, but will not be enough for notes with photos.<br /><br />Overall, one of more solid note android apps available. Take a look.<br /><br />P.S. Make sure you read the user agreement before installing. There are some intrusive aspects that may concern some people. I don't mind though.

They believe, and then they do not take responsibility for their beliefs; they conjure things, and do not trust the conjuration. People populate the darkness; with ghost, with gods, with electrons, with tales. People imagine, and people believe; and it is that rock solid belief, that makes things happen.\\"<br /><br />I can believe things that are true and things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not.<br /><br />I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis and Mister Ed.

I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state.<br /><br />I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste.<br /><br />I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like martians in War of the Worlds.<br /><br />I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman.<br /><br />I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars.

I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too.<br /><br />I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system.<br /><br />I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.\\"<br /><br />\\"One describes a tale best by telling the tale.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved loved loved this book!  A few slow moments when Cline more than geek-whacked off to the 80s references, but the baseline story kept things working and I kept reading (okay, maybe skipping a sentence or four.  I lived the 80s.  My fondness for it is limited.)<br /><br />Weird to read this only days after I'd finished the Hunger Games trilogy.  Similar premise, and oddly less apocolyptic but darker in its own way.  I completely enjoyed both, as both are good tales.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  But make sure that you have time, because it's a true page-turner, and you're going to hate to have to put it down.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I think this app is awesome. Very amusing.. Great idea with the gravity. It takes some getting used to but still very cool
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Like several other reviewers, I found the writing of this book immature and difficult to plow through.<br /><br />And I also found myself pretty quickly disliking Julia - I'd hoped for so much more from an American female character with the opportunity to work in Paris and immerse herself in the culture - why, again, did she love it so much that she moved there?  By about three chapters into the book, I couldn't recall what she liked about the place!<br /><br />Luckily, I was drawn in to Sarah's story, and the history of Paris and the velodrome, so I kept reading because of that.  And I liked Julia's father-in-law, too, so I wanted to know how things ended with him.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />But I wish I'd stopped reading before the end of the book, because I REALLY didn't care for the last encounter between Julia and Sarah's son (grandson?  I read this a while ago, and just now found time to write this review.).  I didn't believe the situation, nor either of their reactions within that situation.  It made Julia seem even weaker and more clueless than she'd appeared before.  Very dissatisfying ending for me.<br /><br />I doubt that I'll try another de Rosnay book.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|this game is awesome! I love the new ways to feed him.<br />this was a good game because I like experimenting!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|On one hand, I'm much too old to be considered the 'target audience' for this series of books.  But, on the other hand, the first several recommendations I got for this series were from other readers in my own age group, so I gave in and bought the trilogy before a long plane trip.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I started reading two days before my departure, and I was so completely sucked in that I finished Book 1 and had to start Book 2 less than 2 hours into the 13 hour flight.  Thank goodness I had plenty of other reading material on my Kindle, because I devoured all three books long before my return flight!<br /><br />The stories in this series are really captivating, and the only reason they seem to fall into the 'young adult' category is because they contain no sex or profanity to speak of, their protagonists are mostly under 20 years old, and because they're complexly disguised morality tales.  But I'd say that anyone who appreciates a good adventure could enjoy this series.<br /><br />My only tiny criticism is that I felt Book 1 was the best.  Book 2 was good, but there were a couple of instances of 'information dumping', where it seemed the author got bored, or needed a good night's sleep, or just wanted to get some info out of the way.  Book 3 was fine, necessary, but not as well written as Book 1.
B000002MUW|3.0|Listening to 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories\\" again after all these years, I've come to the realization this effort does not hold up as well as alot of her other work and has deservedly been relegated to a footnote in Madonna history. This despite the fact that it contains her most successful single ever. Though it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 7 weeks in 1995, \\"Take a Bow\\" feels very manufactured and generic, like she and Babyface sat down to write a commercial, Adult Contemporary hit. The song is pleasant but innocuous and lacks PASSION. The vocal performance seems sterile unlike other ballads such as \\"In This Life\\", \\"Rain\\" and \\"Live To Tell\\"--even \\"Crazy For You\\" showed more emotion.<br /><br />The remainder of the album contains listless tracks such as \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\", \\"Inside of Me\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\", or hip-hop wannabe numbers that contain too much sampling. Madonna responds to the Sex/Erotica/Body of Evidence backlash in a couple of disparate tracks: the wistful opener \\"Survival\\" and angry, defensive \\"Human Nature\\" where she proclaims \\"I'm not your b**ch\\".<br /><br />The incessant fuzzy 'n scratchy 'let's-make-it-sound-like-70s' sampling gets tiresome here and the only highlights are the hit single \\"Secret\\" which to me sounds like the perfect anthem for gay self-acceptance; the mid-tempo feel-good bopper \\"Don't Stop\\" which transcends sometimes silly lyrics; and the darker, experimental pairing of \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Bedtime Story\\". Had the album been built more around these two songs and Madonna tried a darker approach to her music, this would have been a more interesting project and may have aged better.<br /><br />Unless you're a huge fan and want her entire back catalogue, the best songs here are available on a Greatest Hits package and you aren't missing much by leaving these boring stories in the past.<br /><br />Survival 3/5<br />Secret 5/5<br />I'd Rather Be Your Lover 3/5<br />Don't Stop 4/5<br />Inside of Me 3/5<br />Human Nature 3/5<br />Forbidden Love 3/5<br />Love Tried to Welcome Me 4/5<br />Sanctuary 4/5<br />Bedtime Story 5/5<br />Take a Bow 4/5<br /><br />THREE-and-a-HALF STARS.man Nature 3/5<br />Forbidden Love 3/5<br />Love Tried to Welcome Me 4/5<br />Sanctuary 4/5<br />Bedtime Story 5/5<br />Take a Bow 4/5<br /><br />THREE-and-a-HALF STARS.

145162445X|5.0|I am a 78 year old retired classroom teacher, now teaching teachers to \\"teach\\".  One of the greatest challenges for a science teacher is finding authoritative resources to defend the \\"flat universe\\" position. My experience has been the majority of students have a world view that includes the supernatural.  Generally that meant you were thought to be either a Judeo Christian or an Atheist. That is obviously NOT correct. When I first started teaching I had to play \\"devil's advocate\\" to help my students learn and understand there are those who think there is no supernatural. When I brought Charles Darwin's \\"Origin of the Species\\" into the classroom, it seemed like \\"The Scope's Monkey Trial\\". I pointed to my banner, \\"Science is Finding Out\\" and explained you can't find out if you don't allow ALL world views to be studied. Teachers learn early, start your learning experience with the student's viewpoint.  Teach the student to use the Scientific Method as the means to \\"Find Out\\"/\\"Do Science\\". I hold the world view that we are a spirit having a human experience. ALL world views are strongly encouraged in my classroom. I have Darwin, Dawkins, Greene, Barker, Newton, Einstein works, many on Kindles.  Students are encouraged to \\"google it\\" on their iPads.<br />  Krauss begins with the premise \\"Nothing is not Nothing, it is Something\\".  That is a false premise.  \\"Nothing is the absence of Something\\" therefore \\"Something can not be Nothing\\".  A number of ideas used the phrase \\"apparently something came from nothing\\"  I studied the YouTube video hoping to find better supporting evidence. It too used prosopopeia and anthropomorphology?  Another example was paraphrasing (the first faithfully, self-replicating cells with metabolism, that capture energy from the environment) seemed the the most plausible explanation available.  This completely ignores the Causality notion.  Finally Krauss posits that we shouldn't ask why some thing happens, but rather how it works.  That will explain the why.  Pretty neat way of avoiding that pesky question \\"WHY\\", all children use to learn how things work. Thanks for adding to a good book to my Classroom Resources.n the why.

B004ZY0VHY|3.0|... I could find a relatively short review of this book. I don't have time to read these doctoral theses. Do people *live* on Amazon? Is this competitive reviewing?
1451683405|1.0|At about 10 minutes after noon yesterday, an ineluctable series of causal events that no doubt began before the dawn of humanity compelled me to sit for an hour in a Barnes and Noble reading this predetermined collection of words from someone whose parents had been programmed to name him Sam Harris. I regret that this is the way I ended up spending an hour, though of course it's useless to regret what one could not help but do, and, moreover, the \\"I\\" that I imagine I am is just along for the ride anyway.<br /><br />Being predetermined, I can't choose to say that one part of this collection of words was more worthwhile than any other (a sentiment with which Harris would agree, though \\"agreement\\" itself seems superfluous) but if free will were possible, I would choose footnote 15, on the next to last page of the book, in which biologist Jerry Coyne notes that no possible scientific experiment could test whether any action was free from compulsion by previous events or influences. I believe that to be correct and so believed before the predetermined hour I spent reading Harris's book, which seemed to add nothing to the question but inanity and confusion, both delivered with a rather self-congratulatory air--but then, as Harris pointed out near the end of the book, his choice to type or go drink a beer was all alike, and his book proved it.<br /><br />Why Harris didn't simply point out what was in footnote 15 at the outset and then leave the publisher to bind 80 blank pages together is mysterious to me until I remembered that he couldn't help himself. In his case, unknown influences had caused him to believe that even in the absence of free will, it is still useful, not only to talk about choice but to argue against fatalism because our choices have outcomes. This is trivially true in his framework of mental events, though what \\"choice\\" could signify in such a framework beyond a polite fiction, the vestige of the very illusion Harris thinks he is exploding, is not apparent.<br /><br />Other causal factors moved Harris to mention existentialism once, in which he found little use but which he was caused to congratulate for its emphasis on taking personal responsibility for creating meaning in one's life. It happens that I am predetermined to imagine that I am preferring existentialist thinking (or mental event processing) in this regard to Harris's own thoughts, which strike me as laughably facile. In my predetermined view, we do well to choose, and seek to live by, values that optimize our potential as humans. Such choices may be as simple as taking up walking for fitness and losing 35 pounds, or they may involve something more, such as learning chess or reading \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\\" I suppose Harris would not object to this (indeed, it is hard to see how he could \\"object\\" to anything at all, though he certainly does so) but would simply argue that one cannot take credit for such choices, however fortunate, or suffer blame for them, even if they are criminal.<br /><br />One reason that Harris seems to harp on this so much is that he is predetermined to fear that assigning moral \\"blame\\" leads to a largely punitive and inhumane society; specifically, he claims to be unable to find anything in a religious framework that enables the observer of a criminal act to reflect that he, too, might be capable of similar behavior. Actually, such a remedy exists and would have been discovered by Harris had he ever been predetermined to read the simple Christian reflection \\"There but for the grace of God, go I.\\" In any case, Harris may be vindicated (if \\"vindication\\" even matters) by reflecting (or being caused to reflect) that even the act of reading this review may cause you either to avoid the book or to spend the same time reading it as I did.ent.<br /><br />Other causal factors moved Harris to mention existentialism once, in which he found little use but which he was caused to congratulate for its emphasis on taking personal responsibility for creating meaning in one's life.

B000001ESF|5.0|2112 puts Rush on the map, Caress of Steel and Fly by Night are both great albums but 2112 takes Rush to the next level. The progressive influences show all the way, especially on the 20 minute title track which is one of the greatest songs ever. Neil Peart's drumming is amazing here and some of the best drumming ever recorded. Some people say that the rest is filler but it has some great songs like A Passage To Bangkok, The Twilight Zone and Something for Nothing. The entire album's a masterpiece and arguably the best Rush album right next to Moving Pictures.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Darn... educational games never get better. The graphics are great. Its very realistic and you get to start your own TOWN! And I really love the 'westerner' voice. Best of all - it's FREE!
B003Q6D25K|4.0|Paranormal Activity franchise isn't bad and even a bit underrated. I thought the first one was good but I actually prefer the sequel. Plot wasn't bad and it was entertaining throughout. If you enjoyed the first, you'll probably enjoy the sequel also.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I simply fell In love with the game! The story line is one of a kind and when I bought the free version I didn't put my kindle down!!! Then the game just restarted so I didn't know what to do. Finally, I read some of the reviews and figured that the free version didn't have the whole story. After my brain had regestered that, I went to the store to buy the whole story but it was $5.00!!!! If only it was cheaper I would have rated it a 5 star!!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|liking it so far. it is really tempting to buy more coins but I haven't given in yet. we'll see!
0525478817|5.0|This book is just that good. Once I started reading, I could not put it down again until the book was finished.<br /><br />Hard to put into words exactly what it is that is so enthralling - the author's voice, the great characters, the awareness and rejection of the inherent cheesiness of the \\"sick kid\\" genre - it's all great stuff.<br /><br />Read this book.
B005HESYFM|5.0|While a great story in and of itself, this episode is a parable, a roman a clef, a story where the names, times and locations have been changed in order to tell a story that may not otherwise be  told. It's an old story of betrayal and deception, of the weak and powerless resorting to terrorism while the powerful and connected manipulate and murder to retain their power. As it says in Eclesiastes, there is nothing new under the sun, regardless of what sun it may be.  If only there were men like Picard and organizations like star fleet in the real world...
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I am giving this 1 star for Albert Brooks, it was nice to see him in a movie.  Other than that this movie was so bad!  It's was like pulling teeth waiting for something to happen.  So many long drawn out pauses and stares, like wayyyyyyy drawn out.  Laughable because I couldn't help saying \\"really?\\" at most of the scenes... and not because it was funny. I would not recommend this film to anyone.  Not really sure how it is scoring any 5's?????
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Item was as advertised. Works great with my Nikon Coolpix P7100 and P7000. Can also be used with my D300, but I have the SB-900 for that. Thank you, Amazon.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film, but a friend recommended it to me, so I checked it out; now it's one of my favorites. Given, the acting isn't always the best, and there are parts that I wish had been more elaborated upon; but the overall message of \\"Courageous\\" is wonderful, and it pushed me to rethink the way that I'm treating my own family, as well as people in general. 5 stars.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|I originally wrote a negative review of this album.  Somehow the review didn't get published, and I'm glad because something happened between the time I hated this record to loving it.  I stopped listening to the negative comments and I found myself putting this CD on every day for weeks.  More and more, I felt I was just getting it.  Now I consider this one of my favorite albums in a long time.  It won't appeal to hard rock fans who need to ROCK.  This is a grower, mellower music, that requires a little patience.  If that sounds pretentious to you, like it did to me, then you are not being fair to it.  Give it repeated listens and be open to where it takes you.  Damned if I can make out any of the lyrics, but it doesn't matter.  This is a musical ride, an escape from the norm, something different that you just can't even label.  I firmly believe this record will stand the test of time and become greater through the years.  How many albums can you even consider in such a light?  Highly recommended.
B007MJKOY4|2.0|I wanted to like it. Sorry, I didn't like it. I'm not a fan of the seventies style of film making. We have come so far. The story line was slow. I understand this was a book made into a movie. I think I see why many books are changed to go onto the big screen.

0553801503|2.0|After plowing through the first two books with ease, I reached the third book and I began to realize some of the elements of this author's style really irked me. This only got worse and worse as I reached FfC, book four. The way EVERY meal was described in detail. The perfect way he described the clothing they wore or the inn in which they stayed. The ridiculous number of pages he had to describe a cock. It's all too much.<br /><br />But wait... It gets worse. Many of the characters have one, maybe two dimensions, if they're lucky. Kat is ridiculously annoying in every aspect. Sam is annoying in that he's a huge coward. And all of them have these, once charming phrases, but now really annoying sayings. This author reiterates the same thing over and over and over. We are not stupid. As readers, we are totally capable of grasping the nature of a character after 3 MASSIVE books. You don't have to keep reiterating that Sam is a coward or that Tyrion is ugly multiple times in every single chapter.<br /><br />I really wanted to finish this book and then read book 5; however, it wasn't happening. I could get through 5-10 pages before I found myself drooling all over my shirt.<br /><br />I'd suggest readers abandon this series after book 3. The splitting of FfC and Dance with a multi-year gap and a snails pace plot looks disastrous for readers. At this rate, Martin will likely die before he will be able to finish the series.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love it.But warning don't play to mutch because I believe it has some sort of VIRUS! wish you the best.
B005HSL626|4.0|I am a mom who realizes that in today's society there is NO WAY you can shield your kids from everything. Sorry fellow moms but its tome to realize that now its not about shielding and more about deflecting and explaining. This new generation is part of a super technological informational world where answers are in your pocket and nothing is taboo anymore. This is mainstream America and you can either fight and fall victim or adapt and overcome. I believe the paid versions have no ads if I'm not mistaken. if you cant handle the ads and society's sex sells attitude there is always the amish way... Otherwise good luck with the fight ladies!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Television can put out something of artistic value and still have a wide appeal. Life is gritty. A compelling drama should be equally so and BB meets this challenge head on and in a believable format. Who among us has not wondered about what it would be like to step out of the restraints of an honest living and go for it?  This is an addictive show as is the product portrayed by the efforts of the cast. Give it the first three episodes and you can find out what it's like on the other side without going through rehab or ending in jail.
0142001104|5.0|I loved this book. I read it last year and keep going back to it. The Zanders outline a process to step outside of the world of measurement into a world of possibility. I recommend this book for students, managers, and anyone who has a job or interacts with other human beings.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Television can put out something of artistic value and still have a wide appeal. This was my favorite season due to it providing extreme plot developments, and fulfilling your expectations with each step. If you have always felt that TV dramas were corny, this is the show for you.  This is the finest TV show of all time for a US series.<br /><br />Do not start his show in the middle watch season one first.  It is a requirement to truly appreciate this story, the characters, and the twists.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Ok Ok not an Oscar winner, doesn't have the greatest dialog and some corny scenes.  However, this movie will keep you involved from beginning to end.  Extremely intense and entertaining.  My husband and I loved it and have watched it a few times.  If you are a critical person and expecting perfection, don't get it.  If you're laid back and just looking for a good movie to enjoy on the weekend this is it.
B004EPZ034|4.0|In this movie, the Chipmunks, Chipettes, Dave and Ian, the guy from the first movie that was mean, get stranded on a deserted island.  They find a girl named Zoe who is kind of crazy and who is looking for a treasure.  She makes Jeanette go into a cabe to get the treasure and won't let her come up till it's found, and this was so much like \\"The Rescuers\\" that I laughed.<br /><br />This is my least favorite Chipmunk movie but is still all right and worth watching.  I do like the emphasis on teamwork and the way Alvin learns not to be a brat.

B000EGF0NW|5.0|\\"Lucky\\" is a memoir with guts. From page one, and on the last day of her freshman year of college, it recounts Alice Sebold's brutal rape in three-D clarity. The will to not die during such violence directs everything Alice says and does, and trumps all.<br /><br />Alice does all the right things that night: she's taken to the hospital where rape kit evidence is obtained, and she files a report with the police.<br /><br />The most satisfying thing about the book is Alice's determination to return for her sophomore year. One day when she and the rapist's paths cross, she hurriedly reports his sighting to the police, who place an APB.  When he's picked up, she must jump through hoops to positively identify him. The book details those procedures: methodical affidavits given to police; police line-ups; meetings with attorneys; court hearings, and the actual trial. A book of courage and determination!<br /><br />Constance Richardson, author \\"Swimming Upstream: A Memoir.\\"
B004PP158W|4.0|My favorite episode of Supernatural!  This is a great story of how the Winchester brothers would handle an alternate world where their lives were an actual TV show.  Full of hilarity and action. Suspense is always around each corner.  Great entertainment.

0385535139|5.0|After a long time John Grisham returns to writing a decent legal novel. Thriller it is not, enjoyable it is.<br />David Zinc is a young, bright, and burned-out attorney, working with a large firm that employs thousands of bright and young attorneys like him. David has a meltdown one fine morning, and spends the rest of the day, and afternoon, and evening at a downtown pub, drinking himself beyond drunk. He spends the night at the offices of Finley and Figg, partners at a boutique law firm. Calling it boutique and firm would be a stretch, and calling Finley and Figg laywers an even greater one. These are two past-middle-age lawyers who make their money by handling quickie divorces, DUIs charges, and have a dog's keen ear-sight, shall we call it, for car wrecks. This is where David Zinc, the bright, young, and now burned-out lawyer, decides to work at. While Figg (Wally) pokes around and dscovers a retirement-rich pot of gold jackpot waiting in the form of a cholesterol-reducing drug that may have been causing heart-attacks, David gets involved in trying to get justice for the undocumented immigrant parents of a now mentally-handicapped child, who got exposed to chemicals in the paint on a toy.<br /><br />That, in a nutshell, is the plot of the book. The book is replete with hilarious send-offs of almost everyone in the book - lawyers mostly. The plot is not too complicated or multi-layered to make it a heavy read. The characters are mostly, and transparently so, transparent, shall we say, and in one case, we can see the train wreck coming from a mile away.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|...and I am not disappointed. This is one of the few films that I can go back to the theater and see over and over without any qualms.<br /><br />I won't bother to give a summary since so many already have. I think they made great choices when they altered the story from the original source written 100 years ago to make it more palatable to modern sensibilities and to remove the serial style of writing that the original had used to keep the story going.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film enough if you like action and adventure and even more importantly romance. They so captured the flavor of romance that the books had that even my wife (who I had to drag to see the film) wanted to see it again and can't wait for the DVD release to see it again.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|Okay, first let me dispense with the obvious: this is another 2-CD live Iron Maiden album. There are a great many of these, and most of them are very good to great snapshots of an amazing band. Do you need it? No. Rock in Rio and Flight 666 offer the same sonic weight from the band and energy from the crowd found throughout En Vivo. So why might you buy it? Two reasons, I think. First, you're a huge Maiden fan and you pretty much buy all their stuff, regardless of whether of not you really need yet another live version of Hallowed Be Thy Name. That's me. Or second, you're a Maiden fan and you want to hear some particularly good live recordings you can't get on other CDs, or you're looking for some live versions that are clearly different from those found on other, earlier, works. If you fit this second description, En Vivo would go really well alongside Rock in Rio and F666.<br /><br />For example, Coming Home is a great tune off Final Frontier, and the version on En Vivo is amazing, sonically. It has something of the anthemic power of Blood Brothers or Fear of the Dark, and highlights all members of the band. The Final Frontier and El Dorado are a great opening pair, too, much like Aces High/2 Minutes to Midnight or Wicker Man/Ghost of the Navigator. And you can't get these three songs on other discs.<br /><br />Dance of Death is as good, or better, than what's on Death on the Road - and that's a great version of the song. Fear of the Dark is closer to that on Rock in Rio than F666 (and I think that's a good thing), and yet distinct. Listen to them both and they differ - and are both really good. 'Iron Maiden' offers a slight variation on the main riff, different from F666.<br /><br />When the Wild Wind Blows is actually better live than in the studio - there's another one, along those others I mentioned, that make the album unique. Finally, Running Free's here, which was missing from F666, and I think it's a better live version than what you'll find on Live AfterDeath (I know! Heresy! But the recording/production value is 20+ years newer, and picks up so much more of the song...like Rime of the Ancient Mariner on Live After... vs. the version on F666...the latter blows the older one away). And here's a random note: Adrian has a lot more wah in his solos on this album than others - it offers nice texture you don't hear as readily on RiR or others. I like the difference.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a very solid album that you do not need, and yet will likely enjoy a great deal if you buy it. So Up the Irons and buy it!
B005HSL626|5.0|its a great and fun game that any ages can play all you do is slice the fruits.  you do that by swiping your finger across the screen.  you can unlock different backgrounds and different blades to use to slice the fruit.  I play it like every day.  that's how fun it is!!!!!!
0061726834|4.0|This is one of those titles that had so much buzz around it when it first came out, that I put off reading it as I didn't think it would be able to live up to the hype. I'm glad I put it off, because I think I would have been disappointed if I'd read it amid all of the hoopla. As it is, I came to the story fresh and without any expectations. Well worth the wait!<br /><br />Lena is the main character, who is looking forward to receiving the Cure. Her family has a checkered history of being infected, so Lena has grown up afraid that she might succumb as well. She is counting down the days until she is old enough to be cured, until the unthinkable happens when she least expects it....<br /><br />Lena was a likable enough character, but I didn't really care for her family. I understand her aunt and older sister being standoffish as they had been cured, but her younger cousins seemed a little strange. Really liked her friend Hana though! Was a little surprised at her attitude at times, but she seemed like a good friend.<br /><br />And Alex! If you're going to be infected by the delirium of love, he's a good choice! I thought his history was a little too pat, and he seemed to have it a little easy for being what he was, but all in all he was very likable. And I really liked the ending, as it was believable. Can't wait to read the sequel and see what happens next!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is an excellent app. I love that u can see a 15 day outlook. And it is all just a click away! The temps are quite accurate too
0525423656|3.0|This was the much anticipated sequel to Matched (see my review here). We pick up shortly after the end of Matched, with Cassia determined to find Ky instead of meekly following the path the Society has laid out for her. Have to admit that I liked the first book better, as I was really intrigued by the mysterious Society and how it worked. This one was mostly set outside the Society, and I found myself a little bored at times.<br /><br />Cassia and Ky take turns narrating the story and the chapters are labeled so that there's no confusion. The plot was pretty smooth, despite the different voices. There were a couple of coincidences in the story that I found a little unbelievable, and I didn't really get one plot point and wasn't sure what Condie was aiming for.<br /><br />Have to admit that I'm curious about what will happen next and where Cassia will end up. Xander surprised me a little, so I'm not as sure about him as I was in the first book. I liked this one okay, and will read the next book just because I'm curious how things will turn out. Middle books are tough, and this one was no exception. Gave it a 3/5 as it wasn't as good as the first one, but still okay.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read the complete series and loved it. I am going to reread them again lol. Once you start reading the books its hard for you to put them down because you are whats going to happen next.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this was not bad for a free classic game. it however could use more display options but over all good.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I bought this to watch movies & shows from my iphone 4 on my HD TV. I also purchased a separate HDMI cable to go with this. It works great! Very easy to plug in. No more worrying about skipping DVD's.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I bought this in past December, I'm very happy with this little baby, it runs fast, cool and is very easy to overclock, I paired it with an ASUS P8Z68V-PRO and 16GB Corsair Vengenace Blue. Running at 4.0GHz with stock cooler, no problem so far, no cons on this beast. If you can afford it then go for this. Happy happy happy!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|good game with lots of levels.  you really have to think and plan sometimes.<br />had to use hints several times but I keep playing it
B004N622EY|5.0|Awesome book with an excellent story line that keeps you hooked.  Is not a typical happily ever after book, people die.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Ignore the critics, talk of the cost of the film; director Andrew Stanton shot the story line perfect.  With splendid special effects, you are emerged in the world of John Carter.  Like James Cameron's Avatar, you will follow a broken warrior's journey to self redemption.  John Carter is a drifter after being a cavalry officer in the Civil War.  He no longer finds love in his heart, wandering lost without a purpose.  By accident, he teleports to Mars and discovers new meaning and new purpose.  The world of Mars explodes on screen, creatures, a war that is being fought in front of him, and he is given new powers due to the gravity of Mars.  John Carter could make a difference in this war if he so chooses.<br /><br />  Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote this before Superman, Star Wars, Avatar, Starship Troopers, and Dune.  I read three of the book series by him and have waited 35 years to see a screen adaptation.  I was not dissapointed at all.  Disney, the cast, especially the leads and Willem Dafoe, did a splendid job.  I saw the picture twice on opening weekend, 2D and IMAX 3-D.  Everyone that I know who has seen this picture has liked it.  This film is far better than The Prince of Persia.  I only hope that Disney does a second film from the book series.
0439023521|2.0|I suppose I should be glad that young people and adults are reading anything, but this book sets a new lower bound for poor writing.  The previous sentence uses more commas than in the entire book.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I loved the film and eagerly look forward to the DVD.  I will bow to no one as a fan of Burroughs because I am a third generation reader, having first editions of some of the books from grandparents, and I have passed this love to children and grandchildren.  I have collected a great deal of Edgar Rice Burroughs material, but I hold most dear a letter from him in 1947.  As a kid I had the gall to send him a story idea, something I realized later that few professional authors are happy to receive.  ERB was very gracious and sent me a letter expressing his appreciation and complimented me on my imagination as an eleven year old.  He encouraged me to keep writing which I have in one form or another.<br /><br />I had seen the awful John Carter of Mars film on the SyFy Channel and frankly worried about how this film would be handled.  I need not have worried as Disney did an excellent job.  Not exactly like the original novel, A Princess of Mars, but very close and all my favorite people were there.  We have the great beauty of the planet which I cannot see why some critics felt was boring.  It was an honest depiction of the planet Barsoom which I read about as a kid and later reread.  John Carter is pretty much as I imagined him, \\"the incomparable\\" Dejah Thoris is a beautiful warrior princess, Tars Tarkis and other Tharks are exactly as I envisioned they would be and it was so good to see Woola.  As a kid I wanted a Calot for a pet.  I liked certain things added to  the film not in the book.  Such things as Civil War flashbacks that gave us a picture of why John Carter was the type of person he turned out to be once on Mars.  The story was very well done and the special effects met the visions I had when I read the original books.<br /><br />I have seen the film more than once, and outside of family members who knew details from me, I found that describing certain aspects about Mars in the original books helped make this an enjoyable film for those who had never experienced ERB.  It is also possible that Tarzan films, so often rerun on TV. hurt John Carter  because of expectations.  We do need to advise people that the Tarzan in the films, as much as we loved Johnny W., are definitely not the Tarzan in the books.  Burroughs himself was not that happy with those films, however they were money makers. We think he would have loved this film.  I am critical about the marketing as and feel that Barnes and Noble and other stores should have been able to release the works of ERB much earlier than waiting for the film to come out.  At least that is what happened where I live.  Just as The Hunger Gams wetted the appetite for kids to see the film, which I personally was not that sold on, there would have been a greater desire to see John Carter.  I also believe it would have been wiser to keep the original title, A Princess of Mars.<br /><br />Sadly I have heard that Disney has dropped plans for a sequel.  A real shame as this could have been a series to have rivaled Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Pirates of the Caribbean and even Star Wars.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its probably one of the best apps i'v found on my kindle YET!It's just like NEW Super Mario Bros except you play as a Leprichaun. (I know I probobly spelled leprichaun wrong)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty cool...i like that i can play offline and have several games to choose from and most are easy enough to not frustrate but hard enough to challenge
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I have mixed feelings about the cover. I like the fact that it is easy to put on and it covers most of the kindle. It's light weight. I do not like the fact that when I try to use the cover as a stand it always slips off and does not stay in place all the time. If you are needing it just as a cover it works great. But if you need to use it as a stand, it does not work so well. (I would at another option for a cover).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thought the Downton Abbey series was outstanding.  Beautiful scenery, excellent acting, gorgeous costumes, and the story lines were most appealing.<br /><br />I hope their will be a three and a four in the series at the very least.<br /><br />Although there were topics that were unsavory, they were handled in an unoffensive way.  It makes you want to throw tomatoes at most<br /><br />of the ridiculous shows on T.V. today.<br /><br />Thank you for having them for sale.  Don't stop.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|cannot get past the second level because the game will freeze or crash. played fine on my dinc but completely unplayable now.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I am one of the thousands who read this story in its original incarnation.  I am so proud to have been in on this from the beginning.  As soon as I found the Fifty Shades Trilogy on Amazon, I didn't even question it.  I purchased it immediately.  Christian Gray's intensity is palpaple and Ana's hold over him... The feelings that EL James conjures through her words are overwhelming at times. Watching the journey of these two lovers is an experience not to be missed.  It also needs to be said that the media coverage of Fifty Shades paints a picture that is not altogether accurate.  Yes, there is a lot of sex in this book (as well as the other two of the Trilogy).  The sex plays a very interesting part in the story.  Beyond being erotic in and of itself, the sex between Christian and Ana also serves as a lense through which to guage and follow the evolution of their deeper emotional relationship.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app. Works seamlessy with Amazon digital book store.  Easy on the eyes when reading. Intuitive controllable and settings. A joy to use

0307593312|2.0|Keep in mind, I gave up on this book about 20% of the way through it.  It's entirely possible the final 80% of the book is excellent and I just bailed too early.<br /><br />If you want to read five pages about how a character sips their tea and then three pages describing the pause in a dull conversation, this is the book for you.  The monotony of pages and pages of painfully slow descriptions of meaningless things is occasionally broken up by a bit of porn-lit.  Reading these sections were the only times I didn't feel like beating my head against the wall in hopes I'd find something interesting hidden there, since I was confident I wouldn't find anything interesting hidden in the book.  Maybe I just find 200 word descriptions of someone's nipple less painful than 400 words about nibbling on a cooking.<br /><br />Avoid this book, you would do better just grabbing a random title from the \\"Also Purchased\\" section of a book you like.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am playing this Solitaire Game on my Kindle FIRE.  I really enjoy it and the ease to play on the FIRE.

B007D5DUBG|5.0|I am such a hord core Pretty Reckless fan! I have been following Taylor on youtube before their first EP or cd came out. Hit Me Like A man has only one problem, that it is just an EP and not a new full cd. The three new songs are amazing. Hit Me Like A Man is nearly a perfect song. Great lyrics, awesome music, Under The Water is beautiful and hauting and Cold Blooded has a great tempo! This is a must buy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game have it for both my fire and ipod touch.  get it .I recommend it.  very fun
0670023329|5.0|I read the Kindle version over 2 days and could barely tear myself away from the story. Just one story of an escapee from a North Korean prison camp paints a portrait of an unbelievably brutal, dehumanized society. The seeming indifference of South Koreans to the situation faced by ordinary North Koreans is surprising; it makes me think that reunification would be far more traumatic and difficult than that faced by the two Germanys.<br /><br />This is an important document to build the case against North Korea's corrupt ruling family. Hopefully the story can provide a catalyst for greater awareness and ultimately the overthrow of the evil regime.
031618201X|5.0|Soulless is a graphic novel drawn manga style of the first novel in the parasol protectorate, and I thought the novel was quite good. The characters were attractively portrayed and the storyline entertaining. Unlike the book, I was pleased some of the romantic bits were edited out. I much prefer a well-rounded storyline and Alexia's romance with Lord Maccon isn't my favorite part of the story... It is too argumentative  and predictable for my taste. While some of that is here, it is more well-rounded and de-emphasized, thus allowing the other plot elements to shine through.<br /><br />Artistically I think they portrayed Maccon and Lord Akeldama to perfection. I thought Alexia was a bit off though. I just do not see Alexia going (or any Victorian lady for that matter), with her chest being quite that exposed. And while she was supposed to be large... I just don't see her as that large. It was a bit too much fan service for my tastes. I really do not need to see her falling out of her top quite so often. It gives the story a cheap feel. I also miss Alexia's large nose. She has a dainty little number in this book. Thankfully, she isn't harping about it though.<br /><br />Overall, while I may not like the excessive emphasis on Alexia's d&eacute;colletage, I still really liked the book. I already pre-ordered the sequel.
1416955070|3.0|I've heard such great such things about this book. I've also heard some pretty bad things. It seems like most people either absolutely love this novel or absolutely loath it. I'm one of those people who fall into the middle. While I don't hate this book, I most certainly don't love it.<br /><br />There were many times throughout this book where I contemplated putting it down, but I didn't because a book has to be REALLY bad for me to stop reading it. Don't get me wrong, there were several parts in the novel that were awful. They just weren't terrible enough for me to put down the book.<br /><br />Now onto the characters. My favorite would have to be Simon. I just love the nerdy best friend type! He was just so adorable. I hate to say it, but my least favorite character is probably Jace. I don't know why though. Usually I love cocky guys. Whether they're characters in a book or TV show, or real life people, most of the time I have a massive crush on them. That was not the case with Jace. Something about him truly annoyed me. I honestly don't know what it was, I just found myself skimming through the pages where he had lines. I hope in future books he gets better.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. In this review I have said a lot of negative things about this book. So where's the 3 stars coming from? One word: potential. This novel showed incredible potential towards the end (and I'm not talking about the stupid twist). Because of the promise this book has, and that alone, it received 3 stars. If I didn't feel like the future books would be better, I might have rated it lower. I was seriously considering giving it 2 stars. Then I started getting curious about the next book so I was thinking of giving it 3. But then, that STUPID twist happened, and it went all the way down to 1 star. I went back and forth between 3 and 1 stars for basically an hour after I finished. I guess I just saw of promise for this series so I settled on 3. I don't know why exactly. I guess Ijust felt better giving it 3 stars than 1.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|These books were so amazingly well-written and planned out.  I have to admit, halfway through the first one I wasn't so impressed.  I thought it was very good writing and pretty interesting characters, but found it to be kind of slow.  I didn't see myself purchasing the next one in the series.  It wasn't until well into the book that it started to get exciting.  I eventually found myself getting completely wrapped up in the story.  The main character, Vin, really grabbed my attention; she was so real and so complex.  The second book was actually my favorite of the three, although it too, started out slow.  Most of the action and excitement came in the second half again, when I found myself so enthralled with the story that I completely neglected my house and family to finish it.  There were several huge moments in this book that left me breathless.  Throughout all three books the storyline is deep and complex. Sanderson brilliantly creates a completely believable setting and cast of multi-demensional characters.  This is another set of fantasy books that I think are far better than the current fantasy best seller, Game of Thrones series. Mistborn is deeper, has a better pace, more interesting characters and a more original plot.
0802798225|5.0|Ok. It's official. I'm in love with Alex. He is just so swoon-worthy! Everything about him made me fall in love instantly.<br />I also really like Brittany. I could totally relate to her. She had such a difficult home life, and she was trying (and succeeding) in making everyone think that she was perfect. Since my little sister has Down Syndrome, I have been in some similar situations as her. I think Elkeles did a great job in portraying what it was like to have a sibling that has a mental illness.<br /><br />If I had to find a fault in this book, it would be the end. It just seemed a little far fetched to me. I can easily ignore that though, since it isn't really a big deal.<br /><br />I can't wait until I buy the next book! I'm really interested in reading Carlos' story.

0439023491|4.0|Overall, I really liked the Hunger Games. Although the story lacks a believable explanation of why the games are actually taking place, and how can people bear with it, the book is difficult to put down. I would have loved more history about the rebellion, the capitol, why things are where they are, but overall a good read. I find the writing style pretty simple and at times superficial. The author tried to explore deeply the feelings and fears of the protagonist, but it does come across as a little shallow on the reason of some choices and it does not really go deep on either history or rules of the Capitol. Overall, a good read, not spectacular, but enjoyable enough to make me want to read the next one. I guess this sums it all up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|121 in 1 is a very addicting game series. It is very easy to earn coins to get new games. The games can be hard but I cant put this game down.

0439023513|1.0|I am beyond disappointed with this book. The character development and intriguing story line were so well formulated in the first two books that I had high hopes for this one; sadly, all of those hopes crashed after page 200.<br /><br />The latter half of the book was total chaos and destruction of what could've been an amazing conclusion to the series. The author definitely rushed this one - everything is one dimensional, predictable, and, to be honest, had terrible development. I'm pretty sure a middle school student could weave more dimensional characters into this last book than Collins did.<br /><br />I understand that not everything is rainbows and butterflies, but some of the scenes were unnecessary, as if Collins wanted to just kill off people for the shock value. I am really frustrated with the publisher for producing such a book and even more so the author for allowing this to be the conclusion for Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />Can someone please write an alternative third book? This was the worst.

B005SFR7YE|4.0|I really like this DVD of The Phantom of the Opera.  I usually have some difficulty with live shows for a few reasons:  before the use of individual microphones, I would have difficulty hearing dialog or understanding lyrics; being too far from the stage makes it difficult to appreciate facial expressions and acting.  Also, I tend to feel the mood of music before registering the lyrics.  This DVD remedies these difficulties.  The production itself as well as the performers are excellent.  The camerawork allows for close ups (facial expressions, dialog, acting, details of dance and costume) and the distance views allow for greater appreciation of the corps de ballet and other wider scenes, angles one would not have live.  For the most part, the editing and flow between different camera angles is well done.  Subtitles (or the libretto I saved from my LPs) enhance the storyline by making clear the dialog and lyrics when needed.  One criticism is the uneven volume: the opening fanfare (Universal Studios logo) is very loud; the following dialog is extremely soft, as if individual microphones were not used; the following Overture is loud again and blasted me out of my seat after having turned the volume up for the Prologue.  The first 30 minutes were spent experimenting with settings on my DVD player and TV to get the right balance without having to constantly adjust the volume.  Act II seems to be more even in volume, perhaps because there's less dialog and more continuous music.  (The dialog in the final scene was again inaudible at the lower volume setting.)  (Other DVDs of musicals and this show on PBS did not have this problem.)  It would have been nice to have some production notes included, similar to a Playbill.  I also would like to see this production on a large screen.<br /><br />I recently purchased Les Miserables, the 10th Anniversary DVD (concert style) and previously, Camelot at the Winter Garden (which was filmed for HBO in the 1980s).  I really do like this format.  It's like bringing the show home.  After years of listening to the recordings and closing my eyes to remember the visual, I have both again.  (I hated the movie versions of The Phantom of the Opera and Camelot.)

0553573403|2.0|A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire) by George R. R. Martin is the first book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, starting out with winter is coming. With summers lasting decades and winters lasting lifetimes, it's easy to see why that phrase is so important. With the cold returning, conflict between the seven kingdoms become stronger as lies, betrayals, assassins, and mystery fill the air.<br /><br />I'm not giving this book the highest score, like I see so many others give, but it's still not entirely that bad of a book. I'm not a fan of it too much, but I can see where it's loved.<br /><br />-There were too many characters all at once. I'm all up for different characters, but it felt like I was swimming in an ocean of new characters and some, I don't even remember. I almost felt like it was a character dump. A few chapters into the story, and there's still new characters being introduced. All of it was too much.<br /><br />-POVs. I liked the different POV of the different characters, but some of them I felt wasn't needed at that time. Example, in the beginning, the few couple chapters were in the POV of characters that all within the same family. After a while, it became overwhelming.<br /><br />While I liked the different POVs, I wished there were some in other characters as well. It seemed the POV was more in the \\"good\\" characters or the in between/not sure if they're good or bad. However, the ones that were a bit more \\"evil\\", didn't have a POV.<br /><br />-There are a lot of deaths in here. Some of more of the \\"main\\" characters. There aren't any main characters, just some who are more mentioned than others. I'm all up for the deaths of characters and enjoyed the fact that there were deaths of some characters who were more \\"main\\" than others. If you're not up for that, you might want to skip this book.<br /><br />-There's a good amount of sex and rape mentioned. It's not so detailed that it's not good for teens, but it's not so brushed aside where as it's just \\"they had sex\\". It does have some detail, but not too graphic. It was more honest with the sex and rape. Since this story did have more of a medieval feel to it, there was a need for the rape, sex and even some of the incest, since those things did happen in medieval times. I'm not a fan of the incest part, but it happened.<br /><br />However, what I didn't like, was that it seemed, after a while, an overkill of rape. It was just all over the place and when you read so much of rape going on, it gets to the point where you don't want to read it any longer. It's just too much.<br /><br />-This is a high fantasy novel, which means that it's fantasy that takes place in invented or parallel worlds. Such as Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter. It also has themes of fantasy woven in, such as magic or fantasy creatures and what not. But this... this didn't seem like a high fantasy.<br /><br />I see the high/epic part, of the world building, which I think was excellent, but I didn't see the fantasy part. There was small mention of dragons and hints of magic, but it wasn't strong. The fantasy element was minor, very minor, and it didn't feel like a fantasy to me. It felt more like a high historical fiction, and since George took similarities to War of the Roses, it's easy to see the historical fiction.<br /><br />-The storytelling wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough to keep me going. I tried twice to read it, the first time, I didn't get past the prologue. The second time, it took me six weeks to finish reading it. Six weeks. I can normally finish a book in a day or two, even long books - like this was - can be finished within a couple of days. But this took me six weeks to struggle through it. It wasn't interesting enough to make me want to read it. After a while, I just wanted to skim it and read certain parts or certain characters POV and that was it.<br /><br />I also didn't see much of a conflict going on either. Yes, there was some, but it wasn't strong enough that if this was a stand alone novel, there would be a big conflict that was resolved. By the end of the novel, things started to build up for a conflict, but by that time, it just stopped and you're left waiting to read more in the second book. That was about the time I was a bit more interested in it. And it just stopped.<br /><br />Honestly, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't enough to interest me. I might read the next book, but I'm not motivated to do so right at this moment.t strong enough that if this was a stand alone novel, there would be a big conflict that was resolved.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. I'm never bored because there are so many games to play. I enjoy trying to beat the games so I can unlock new games..
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I love the series, but have comments about the dvd's themselves.  I bought a blu-ray disc of Season 1 here at Amazon.  When I played it, there was no audio through my home theater system.  I tried several things, but nothing worked. I finally put in a different blu-ray disc.  That one worked fine.  The only solution was to re-route the HDMI cable around the receiver and directly into the tv monitor.  That worked, but the only audio we had was through the tv speakers (very unsatisfying).  Amazon replaced it, but that one had the same problem.<br /><br />This week I got Season 2 from the library.  It is not blu-ray.  But it has the same problem.  I had to route around the receiver in order to get any audio.  Since I don't have this problem with other dvd's, it appears to be a problem with the PBS production.<br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions?  I love the soundtrack and would love to hear it as it was meant to be heard.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|really good for kids that are learning to read and kids. learning about baby Jesus. A good book for kids. 10 and older.!!!!!!!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I rented this movie with some trepidation.  I read the book several years ago and it was one of my all-time favorites.  I was afraid (especially with the negative reviews here on Amazon) that it would not only fall below my expectations but it would ruin the beautiful story I remember from the book.  I was so wrong.  This was a great movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was excellent. I couldn't put it down until I finished all five books in a week. I am a huge scifi fan and have been looking for a new author to get into. Found it! Onto the Bern Saga until he comes out with more wool. Soon please!!!
0312944926|1.0|Like several other reviewers, I too have degrees in math and computer science; I studied cryptography and coding theory.<br /><br />Every aspect of computer technology presented in this book are just plain and painfully wrong.  12 gauge printer cable?  Wtf?  Turn off the power and lose all data on the hard drives?  Even a first grader knows that's wrong; even so, NSA doesn't keep backups?!?  How did the so-called e-mail tracer start a new process on the remote machine?  Can't be done with pure e-mail (i.e., data) packets.  Silicon processors light on fire when too hot???  Wow, it must be REALLY hot in Brown's alternate universe, ain't gonna happen on Earth with a 21% O2 atmosphere.  These blatant lies just pile up to build a mountain of BS.<br /><br />Horrible errors make it impossible to recommend to even those who haven't the slightest care about technology.  Do not waste your time or money.<br /><br />In closing, if you do read Digital Fortress, DO NOT repeat any of the content at a cocktail party or the computer savvy guests will think you are a moron.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|been an Angry Birds fan since day one. was all excited for the Space game. every time I play it on my DROID X it boots me off the game after about 5 minutes of gameplay. On top of that, the load time is ridiculously slow! I clocked the startup at 1 min, 15 sec. I've tried removing and re-downloading with the same results. I can't find any info on the web regarding this problem can I be the only one?
1609611543|1.0|At first glance, the book made sense - and maybe its basic premise that modern wheat causes obesity, is actual fact.  I don't know, and I'm not going to bother researching it, because.....<br /><br />The problem is that this author goes way beyond the subject of wheat and starts making expansive and crazy arguments that are contrary to a mountain of accepted science....such as his statement that \\"new studies have exonerated saturated fat as an underlying contributor to heart attack\\" - WHAT NONSENSE!<br /><br />After reading this and other similar outrageous statements, I can only conclude that nothing this book says can be trusted.  My guess is that this is just another wannabe fad diet book.<br /><br />If you really want sound health advice that is backed up by a mountain of scientific evidence, read \\"The Food Revolution\\" by John Robbins or \\"Eat To Live\\" by Dr Joel Fuhrman, or see the movie \\"Forks Over Knives\\".  You don't want to trust your health decisions to unsubstantiated nonsense.
1576875776|5.0|The best book ever. Best pictures ever. I saw it in NYC and I loved it. I hope you enjoy it as much  as I did.

B006ON41FC|5.0|liked it... loved it.  The game is easy to pick up and challenging enough to keep you coming back.  will recommend to friends.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|IIt's super addictive in a weird way. I keep catching myself sneaking off at work to play it! First puzzle game I've played where I wanna keep trying if i get stuck too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, well written.  Makes you want to read the sequels.  Very descriptive and able to picture what is happening.  Had heard from a lot of people that read it with good reviews-I always prefer to watch the movie then read the book because often the detail and story are better in the book.  Haven't seen the movie yet so will see what my thoughts are on it (had a friend that read the book then saw the movie and said movie was nothing like book, but I will see).
B003NX75B8|5.0|It kept you wanting to keep reading and you don't want to put it down. The only complaint I have is that I want more!
B007L5GDGW|5.0|Very fun game with several challenging levels. I really enjoyed the visuals and music from this game and look forward to future updates.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I must admit I haven't read a fantasy novel for some time, but I was completely blown away by this novel.<br /><br />Sweeping, epic, richly detailed and complex, this novel is utterly grounded in the reality of the situations and the characters involved, more so than most contemporary literary fiction.<br /><br />The interplay between loyalty, blood, love, honor and power -- and the limits of each -- creates exquisite tension that unfolds against a fantastical backdrop that feels as real the keyboard I am typing this on.<br /><br />You can't ask for much more in terms of an immersive, contemplative, yet exciting work of such grandeur and scope -- GRRM fully delivers all of that and more.<br /><br />A true landmark.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|This latest edition is certainly the one to have, with one or two reservations.  A couple of new<br />special features have been included but one is missing: the fascinating collection of telegrams,<br />inter-office memos and production notes.  These last appeared on the standard DVD two-disk<br />special edition.  And we have to talk about Blu-ray.  While I understand it is the latest 2012<br />4K quality, there is no wide-screen version, no bookmarking and no BD-Live features available.<br />That said, the full screen 4X3 picture is certainly pristine.  Maybe those  production memos will<br />be included in the 100th Anniversary edition in 2042!
0670023329|5.0|I picked up my copy of Escape from Camp 14 last night after dinner and couldn't put it down. Finished it this morning before I even got out of bed. Riveting. I won't give a summary as some of the other reviews have; even if you know the outline of the Shin's story from news reports or publicity the book has received, the narrative of this book brings home the extremity of North Korea's moral bankruptcy like no news story ever could.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it! I'm stuck on level 14, but it is awesome! I &lt;3 it!!!! My review all summed up get the game!
1451648537|5.0|There's plenty of reviews  here already, so I'll focus in on the bottom line for me: Although this book gives short shrift to certain aspects of Jobs' personal life, and so is really a partial biography in that sense, from a business perspective, it is excellent, and a book anyone in business should read. The insight into how Jobs made decisions, how he pulled off the deals he pulled off, his successes and failures, and how they both shaped Apple, are amazing. His attention to detail, design, and the customer experience, and his merging of intuition, art, and technology, are stunning. It's a good read too - he was a difficult man, with the temperment and sensibility of an artist, not an engineer, which makes for good drama in the narrative of his life.<br /><br />This is also an amazing historical account of the forces that have changed our world in the last 30 years. From the birth of personal computing, through the internet, to mobile devices, the individuals such as Jobs that drove innovation during this time have been the true 'masters of the universe.' The other players that Jobs dealt with - Bill Gates of course, as well as the founders of most of the major technological players of our time - are all featured here, and it makes for a fascinating tale. I was actually quite fascinated, and in the end touched, by the relationship between Gates and Jobs, perhaps the two individuals most responsible for the nature of our world today (one could argue, far more so than any political or social leader during this time, when one considers how technology has transformed world politics as well, in terms of our global connectivity, Twitter, etc.)<br /><br />I would have personally loved more on his personal life. For example, his love of Zen Buddhism (an interest of mine) and how it impacted his design aesthetic is covered, but the exact nature of his practice and the teachers he studied with are not. His marriage and family life are barely covered, although of course by Jobs' own admission, he worked all the time and missed a lot of family life, so perhaps the percentage of space it is given in the book is proportional to the time he gave it in his life. But really, this is a business biography - a record of how he built Apple and Pixar, and all the products they spawned. And Isaacson definitely has a perspective - Jobs saw himself as a visionary at the intersection of the arts and technology, and creator of the most influential company on earth, and Isaacson grants him that legacy.obs' own admission, he worked all the time and missed a lot of family life, so perhaps the percentage of space it is given in the book is proportional to the time he gave it in his life.

B00785P2QC|4.0|This app is fun!<br />It lets you build your own city!<br />You can name it!<br />Also if you need it,it gives you a advice!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Product built in a good quality material, but is too much big compared with the pictures. In my case that I use only two lens (18-55mm and 75-300mm), the bag stay main part of time empty. However, is a very good bag if you need to care more stuffs.

B0073PZU82|4.0|This movie was definitely fun trying to follow.  I actually figured out what was going on about 3/4 of the way through the movie.  That may not be saying a lot for me, but if you like the \\"Haunted House\\" tales with more details then this movie may be for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire.<br />This is a great app. love the Vegas cumulative scoring. It has a good level of difficulty; not too hard not too easy.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|Plain and simple... A classic movie. The Godfather in Blu-Ray turn's it in to a better experience on watching it.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|The journey of Christopher McCandless is sad and beautiful. This book is brilliantly written and does a fantastic job of drawing you into his world. Some may view what he did as crazy and stupid, but it's also a love story between a man and the wilderness. It is very relatable for me, who often feels lost in the world, trying to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. A lot of people go off into the wilderness to find themselves, and Chris just had some tragically bad luck on his journey. I recommend this book to everyone who has ever feels lost, needs inspiration, or is into wilderness survival.
B003ZHVJFA|4.0|Average acting, above average action sequences. The actors chosen for the roles were fairly close to the video game except Kazuya which does not even remotely resemble the video game character.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|great to help me brush up on my game so I can play w/ my son.!!!!!!!!!!!  how much more do I beef to pu
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic read.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and couldn't put it down.  The story draws you in and gradually reveals the many layers behind the characters and unfolding set of events in a way that makes you keep reading on and on.  One of the best novels I have read in a very long time.  Well worth the digital price.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good variety of games - works well on kindle fire. Games cost more as you get into each level and makes it harder to earn more games.
B004I744AS|4.0|Enemy though many of my queries. ended up at Wikipedia I found. This app is good for exploring  content on the net. The games and articles on the main page were a nice touch. Over all a usefull download and fun as well.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was consumed by the book for the two days it took to read it.  Great character development throughout.  I know Newton very well and the details were spot on and I also thought the idylic setting a good choice for this novel.  I do hope we see another book from the author soon.This one was so unique in the questions it made you ask yourself--even days after you finished reading.
0375869026|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Whilst it's a children'/young adult book, this parent also found it very moving and thought provoking.  It's about a boy (Auggie) who was born with terrible facial deformities and who has been homeschooled his entire life.  As he writes: \\"I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid.  I mean, sure, I do ordinary things.  I eat ice cream.  I ride my bike.  I play ball.  I have an XBox.  Stuff like that makes me ordinary.  I guess.  And I feel ordinary.  Inside.  But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds.  I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go.\\"<br /><br />At the age of ten Auggie starts in a regular school and the book is about how he and the people around him adapt to that.  He narrates part of the book, whilst other parts are narrated by his family and friends.  Parts are very amusing and other parts - well, they break your heart.<br /><br />I got this book for my 11 year old son.  He has a disability.  Due to a medical accident when he was very little he has no toes on his left foot, his left foot is \\"stumplike\\" and the lower left leg is withered.  He hates being different and is very self-conscious about kids looking at the ankle/foot orthotic that he has to wear.  For this reason he always insists on wearing trousers, no matter what the temperature is.  He immediately identified with Auggie, and while he hasn't said much to me since finishing book, he voluntarily wore shorts to school the other day.  This is incredibly unlike him and I don't think it's a coincidence.<br /><br />It's a magically wonderful book.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B005KELW26|5.0|Protects the kindle from damage, rain, etc.  There is also an insert for stylus', notes, cash and other items that you may need readily accessible in case you leave your purse at home while going for a stroll.  Awesome.
B000FC2NGM|5.0|Agatha Christie was a genius, if you like \\"cozies.\\"  No car chases, foul language or minute details of crime scenes for Dame Agatha.  She is a gentle writer.  This book features her greatest creation - Hercule Poirot.  As always, the red herrings abound, but she lays out all the clues - no surprises at the end.  We, her readers, just need to use our \\"little grey cells\\" as Hercule does.  This reader, however, is no match for the great detective!  Enjoy.  An aside, if you like Hercule Poirot, check out any (and all) of the television programs starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.  He is terrific.  He has just the right amount of twinkle, the right tilt of the right egg-shaped head.  Aloha, Pam
B005CYLSW8|5.0|It appears that we are all searching for the best set of 9 Beethoven symphonies.  I quit doing that way back when.  I found myself second guessing everything I heard.  The only question now is, did I really enjoy what I heard.  In the Chially case, YES!  I have somewhere around nine sets of these symphonies and I find something pretty fantastic in each one.  Some are faster, some are slower, some are this or that.  I do recommend this set because the sound is great and because Chially does have something a little different to say.  He has a right to bring his level of expertise to the table and it is fun to criticize, however, few of us are true music experts.  I just like classical music and all I can say is that I recommend this release.  But, if you are one who likes to find something wrong with all Beethoven releases maybe this might be construed to be a repeat of what you already have.  I have Karajan, Harnoncourt, Wand, Cluytens, Norrington, Zinman, Haitink, P. Jarvi, Krivine and bits and pieces of others.  I like them all.  Add Chially to the list and what I find is a great deal of enjoyable listening.  I hope your palate for Beethoven will be enhanced a little by this release.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I cannot say why they deem this young adult literature. The story is very adult, the writing is excellent and the characters are compelling.<br /><br />The story of Katniss and how she goes from simply a girl trying to save her sister through the Hunger Games to the role of victor and then on to the symbol of a rebellion is compelling and very human. The commentary on humanity as a whole combined with the human story of Katniss and her struggle to keep her family and friends alive in this post apocolyptic world captures the reader from the very beginning and holds your attention throughout.<br /><br />The author weaves a vet strong tale, a very adult and compelling tale. I read the entire series in a week and have to comment again on the fact that I feel this is not just a 'young adult' series. It is a series that tells a very human tale that the reader can see and feel. Well written, this is a real page turner. The character development is exceedingly well done and allows the reader to become immersed in the world of Panem.<br /><br />In the end, I found this to be an excellent read. Highly recommended.
B004LWZWE2|5.0|I bought ACDC Collector's Edition set as a gift for my son-in-law.  He thought it was totally awesome.  I know ACDC is a favorite of his so I took a chance.  This was a winner for sure.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is a movie that has great symbolism.  Besides that it is a smart action-packed movie that displays great use of slow motion, and the whole \\"matrix\\" special effects that everyone that they needed to use after it came out.  This movie is one of my favorites and I think everyone should watch it at least two times.
1439102732|2.0|I usually really enjoy Picoult's books but this one never gripped me.  I was able to get about 1/2 way through before I finally gave up and moved on.  The beginning was very sad and depressing and it eventually picked up a little but not enough for me.  The subject matter may be a problem for some people as it does deal with lesbian relationships (I was not aware of this before starting in).  Although not a problem for me, it was a surprise.<br /><br />I downloaded the music that is to go with the book which I thought was a great idea.  However, I didn't feel like the music really went with the chapters it recommended and most of the songs sounded the same to me.<br /><br />Overall, not my favorite book by Jodi Picoult.

B004UID2LC|5.0|Instead of downloading videos through your laptop, why not use this app. Great download speeds. I use it all the time. Instead of watching them load on your browser or stream it with youtube, why not do a one-time download instead?? You can replay it again and again* when it's done and use it without wifi connection. The speed will amaze you.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I was so overwhelmed with what this app could do that I jumped right at it, created lots of notebooks and notes. It does the job pretty well so why did I get bored?? This app just lacked color. IT LACKED LIFE. It wasn't visually entertaining. Everything looks dull with the black font. A highlighter could have been useful. Make it stand out more. I found that while I was reading with it, it got pretty boring and dull. Even though I got my notes organized, they all look muddled together. All look the same. Not that exciting anymore. A little color won't  hurt anybody. Just saying.
1400031354|5.0|Other reviews have praised this book, the series, and of course the writer.  I have nothing to ad to that praise but an affirmation of all the good that has already been said.  I have something else to say.<br /><br />What makes this book different? First of all, it tells believable stories about everyday people, a land, and the foibles of humanity. It does that very well, but then a lot of books do that.  There was something else. When I started reading the books there was something different that it took me awhile to figure out.  Then I did figure it out. I noticed when I finished reading a chapter or two, in either one of the books (both the first in the series and then this one), I felt good.  I felt calmly energized, optimistic, and hopeful about life.<br /><br />How many writers can do that?  This is a book that makes the ordinary extraordinary.  I think it takes a great soul to write like this, and having read the first book, and now this one, I look forward to reading the whole series this summer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that I have never reviewd a book and my review covers all three books in the trilogy.  I absolutely love Christian; and Anna is the perfect woman for him.  This is the best love story I have read in years.  Their story is compelling and you are constantly rooting for Christian.  My heart goes out to him.  There is ALOT of sex, hot erotic sex, in this trillogy, but if you normally don't read erotic romace, please reconcider.  I have reccomented these books to everyone I know. Including people I would't admit to reading erotic romace stories to because the story is that good and the characters are so complex. This story is truly a love story at heart. Anyone who is a sucker for a love story will love these books.  Plust it has the perfect title. A must read!!

B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is a fake review. Meaning i have not downloaded or installed this app. It seems like a usefull app though. im just tired of all the crappy one star reviews of people that &quot;dont have a need for this app&quot;. To give it one star purely based on the fact that you dont need it or set the time wrong is biased on the fact that it is user error. People please read all the reviews. You will find that most one star reviews are sent by 12 year old trolls. To quote one troll in this review (Brian) &quot;ya mad yet&quot;.
B002EXGQXQ|4.0|I liked the first movie and this one was a good follow up.  Hellboy's personality makes the movie.  I wonder if they will do a part three.
B006X415GK|5.0|I bought this doll yesterday at Wal-Mart.. Was expecting to pay 11 or 12 dollars but paid $4.13! There were about 12 of her on the shelf! Don't know why the last reviewer seems to think we arw lying about this... ?  Whoever they talked to at Kmart must be clueless, bc no Skull Shores doll retails at $27!  And she is already available..  Anyway, bottom line is this is a neat Frankie Stein doll.. And is my personal favorite from Skull Shores. :). She is limited edition, so snatch her up for her super low price id you find her!
B002M7A79S|5.0|This was a good movie, especially for Firefly fans, we only got 13 episodes so this was a well received addition.  The plot fit right in with the show but could be held on its own.
0439023513|1.0|Very difficult to enjoy a book in witch the main heroine just wallows in self pity and mostly refuses to live her life. Perhaps that is what the author wanted me to feel, but I never did. I't felt like plenty of the other characters were moving on with their lives and indeed I wanted to read more about them that our heroine. But no chapter after chapter of... wallowing.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book during a cross country flight and I could not put it down.<br />When the plane landed, I was not quite finished and did not want to leave my seat.<br />Flying JetBlue so I had plenty of opportunity for distraction but did not matter as I was enthralled with the book.<br /><br />Can not wait to read the remaining trilogy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before. Wool FORCED me to change that.  I often give star ratings in my mind though and five stars are far and few between. Wool deserves that and more.<br /><br />To me, the greatest compliment I can give a book is to tell others that they have got to read it. I have been relentless in suggesting this book to all of my friends that are avid readers. I haven't been this impressed by a book in a long, long, LONG time.<br /><br />Please Mr Howey, write more. You have a life long fan in me!
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|Excellent video, true to the Autobot story. I missed Megan Fox but her replacement was a great Actress and easy on the eyes! I hope the series doesn't loose steam and die!
B003EYVXVE|5.0|The goods:<br />Story: breathtaking<br />Picture: outstanding<br />Acting: unforgettable (esp. Jennifer Lawrence on Rue's last moment scene)<br />Costumes: colorful (my wife is a fashion designer and she LOVES them)<br /><br />The bad:<br />Not enough development for the antagonists... Time to read the books...<br /><br />I'm still giving this 5 star.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  its fun,  &amp; entertaining. it has so many differant chooses of games in one &amp; to me, that is freakin' beast! (:
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm so glad I got the trilogy, because I flew through the first book and can't imagine having to wait to start the next one.
B005PK58TI|5.0|Good quality, recommend. Easy to download, access and watch. Plugged the laptop right into the TV and watched, just like watching on TV.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's actually a pretty good set of games. as you unlock more games, the games become better and evolve to be more challenging than the initial arcade games that you are given.
B007C94XG4|2.0|I think this latest movie starring the adorable Alvin & The Chipmunks was horrendous. I'm no stranger to corny movies but Chipwrecked was almost unbearable. In the first 10 minutes I was wanting to turn it off, but Jordan (my 3 year old) was insisting on watching it.<br /><br />It's always cute seeing chipmunks strut around dancing and singing popular songs, but the acting from Jason Lee (My Name is Earl) was killing me! I mean, I know it's probably not easy acting alone since the chipmunks are added later, but come on...<br /><br />That being said, I might be a little harsh when it comes to reviewing movies like this. While I literally despised this movie, my son Jordan loved it! He has his DVD player on repeat and hasn't watched anything but Chipwrecked since Friday. He's even running around the house constantly saying the funniest part of the movie, where Alvin slams into a tree and says in a strained voice, \\"Oh, my acorns...\\"<br /><br />Definite favorite of children 5 and under but I wouldn't force it on anyone over that age.
B0077ATSZE|1.0|I suppose it is blasphemous to be critical of a movie with Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and Max von Sydow, but I found the script pretentious and the acting over the top.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I don't think George Clooney is ever going to get old. He's been that handsome distinguished fellow since I was a little girl and he still looks the exact same.<br /><br />I don't think there's been one movie that he played in that I didn't like. I knew when I put in The Descendants that it was a drama and I wasn't sure if neither I or my husband would be able to make it through the movie since we consider our favorite genre to be action movies, but we were both pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The words said at the beginning of the movie, is what captured me. (paraphrasing) \\"People think Hawaii is a paradise. What they don't realize is that the people there are not on a perpetual vacation. They have lives too with just as much hurt and pain as you.\\"<br /><br />Alex (played by Shailene Woodley) reminded me a lot of myself at that age. My 'Let's Face It' attitude and 'Believe No Bull' personality got me in a lot of trouble as a teenager. I just wish I had a friend like Sid (Nick Krause) to watch him get punched in the face. That part was funny. =)<br /><br />If you get teary eyed while watching emotional films, then be prepared with tissues in hand before sitting down to watch The Descendants.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|In this flashback novel, MP Major Jack Reacher investigates the murder of a civilian woman in a small Mississippi town next to an Army base.<br /><br />A prequel to the entire Reacher series, it's not necessary to have read the other books prior to jumping into THE AFFAIR.  It stands alone.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to put down.  The characters jump off the pages.  The story hums along believably.  Strangely, though, it seems to lack real suspense.  The plot, which compels the reader ahead in search of the solution, doesn't exactly get the pulse racing.  The climactic scene feels forced.<br /><br />Lee Child is a true master, and it's easy to recommend this novel, but it does feel bloodless in places.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|I've had this movie in my collection for a while but I hadn't been in the mood to watch it. I don't know what the hell my problem was... This was a very good movie! I've liked both Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway in every movie I've seen them in, but I never considered them my favorites until Love & Other Drugs.<br /><br />I have to address the issue of the nudity in this movie. I can't say that I wasn't shocked to see Anne Hathaway (Princess Diaries) pull out her boob and flaunt around naked as a jay bird throughout a good portion of the movie. I even made the comment that I felt like I was watching soft core porn at times. But the story line was great and seeing Jake Gyllenhaal's perfectly sculpted butt was definitely a bonus.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is an amazing book. I could not put it down.  It is fascinating, horrifying, inspiring, and surprising all at once.  It is written like a novel, but the stories are true.  I hope that some day I can do my part to help alleviate the suffering of the North Korean people.
6305897786|5.0|I happen to be a fan of Sir Roman Polanski, his earlier works like 'Rosemary's baby and 'Death and the maiden' has impressed me a lot and without a doubt 'Ninth Gate' is a gem as well. Lot of reasons makes the film worthwhile, one of the reasons being, a brilliant performance from the protagonist 'Dean Curso' played with perfection by Johnny Depp. Depp not only easily steps into Curso's shoes but also breathes a lot of life into the character, you can almost read his mind every time and every moment. A similarly stunning performance from Emmanuelle Seigner and Frank Langella who support Depp completely in making this film worth watching more than just once. Watch out for Lena Olin in a brief but an impressive appearance. The film begins in a slow pace but will make you grow more and more curious every moment as the story suddenly takes on a rapid pace and surprises start to come in. In other words 'Ninth Gate' is not a horror film, there is no special effects or monsters rising around, it is a film that will psychologically influence you and make you think. Watch it, it's one of helluva ride and you are sure to enjoy it.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Yes, it's 3 CD's worth of music, but it's worth the price and the worth the effort to listen to it all the way through ... again and again and again. Sheer pop genius: a blissful. orgasmic kaleidoscope of mesmerizing pop-rock. Some quirky songs, some mainstream fare, some tunes so good they run rings around your brain and threaten to never leave. Stephin Merritt has assembled yet another impressive cast of kindred musicians who help to make these songs burst with energy and harmony. A wild, audacious album that still inspires with every listen.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />So what is a \\"Chimera\\" movie?  Well, in Greek mythology a Chimera is a fire-breathing monster composed of a lion's forequarters, a goat's hindquarters, and a snake for a tail.  If you prefer, it's an outlandish \\"Frankenstein monster\\" creature, made of wildly different parts.  Therefore, I define a \\"Chimera\\" movie as one created from wildly different but familiar movies. Boston Globe movie critic Ty Burr reflects this sentiment in his \\"Hunger Games\\" review, where he states:<br /><br />  \\"(If you want to count off this movie's obvious inspirations, by the way, you'll run out of fingers and  toes. \\"Truman Show'' and \\"Wizard of Oz'' are joined by \\"Logan's Run,'' \\"The Running Man,'' \\"The Most Dangerous Game,'' \\"The 10th Victim,'' \\"1984,'' \\"Big Brother,'' \\"Red Dawn,'' and countless other influences, and there's an angry online contingent of \\"Battle Royale'' fans that want their 2000 drive-in Japanese classic left in peace.\\"<br /><br />I'll add to this laundry list by mentioning other movie and literature references: Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\", \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\", \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Spartacus\\" and other Roman Empire spectacle movies, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" (Elizabeth Banks's character Effie Trinket reminded me of Helen Bonham Carter's Queen of Hearts), \\"Robin Hood\\", and \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (especially toward the end of the movie when game contestants and \\"star-crossed lovers\\" Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) consider eating some berries).<br /><br />Okay enough of that.  In the same review, Burr continues:  \\"All of which proves that it's never about where you get a story from, but what you do with it that counts.\\"  So, does \\"The Hunger Games\\" (hereafter THG) utilize its myriad movie parts wisely and effectively?  I believe it does, and that it does so due to Lawrence's fairly nuanced and commanding portrayal as Katniss.<br /><br />Without repeating too much of the plot (I hope) since other posters have done that quite efficiently, I felt that Katniss exhibited the proper mixture of tension, resourcefulness, courage, and resoluteness to make THG's portrayal of a sadistic, decadent United States of Dystopia more than halfway believable.  We get a glimpse of her pre-Games struggle to keep her and her impoverished mother and younger sister Primrose (Willow Shields) fed and alive with her archery skills.  We appreciate her desperate but noble and prudent gesture to volunteer to take Primrose's place in the Games (because we suspect the fragile, terrified Prim would easily have been eliminated). We understand her brusque, standoffish demeanor as she negotiates the pre-Game trials and trainings and subtly introduces us to this bizarre world of the garish elite that control the human sacrifice games.  We get hints of her sly intelligence and tenacious will to live as, despite her fiery pride, she does listen to former Hunger Games champion and dissolute current sponsor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to curry favor with these grotesque aristocrats in order to improve her odds.  She does the same with fellow District 12 contestant Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) with whom she shares an ambiguous supportive and dismissive relationship; in other words, are they just acquaintances forced to be uncertain allies under cruel circumstances, or are they becoming friends or something even more?  Does Katniss have a plan to defy Panem's masters (her shooting the apple from the roasted pig's mouth during training and her three finger salute to the districts watching the Games sure seem like it) or is she trying to get the odds of her survival more in her favor? Katniss's tantalizingly elusive performance sells us on the seriousness of her strange predicament, and so we become invested in the workings of THG's deliberate, patchwork plot, and the fates of its characters, primarily Katniss's.<br /><br />Without Katniss to guide us, I'm afraid thatTHG might have become more sluggish under the weight of its movie and literature borrowings.  With the possible exception of Peeta, the rest of THG's characters, I feel, get scant time to develop their motivations and goals.  The other Games contestants (except maybe the crafty but soulful Rue (Amanida Stenberg)) are simply one-dimensional, sketchy victims. How about learning a little more about them?  Lenny Kravitz's sympathetic sponsor Cinna has only about a couple of meaningful interactions with Katniss as he helps her overcome her insecurities and doubts.  Banks' Effie gives us just a fleeting taste of the flaky, superficial decadence of Panem's (is that short for Pan-Empire, or All-Empire?) elite.  Regarding our introduction to the destitute District denizens, besides Katniss and her soul-sapped family, we barely meet Katniss's handsome beau(?) and fellow hunter Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who seems to be introduced mainly for a potential menage a trois with Katniss and Peeta.  As for Panem president Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), he is genteelly, quietly menacing and inscrutable, which is okay, but it would have been nice to have at least a couple more scenes to establish a little bit more about his character.<br /><br />THG also seems to have logical inconsistencies.  The main objective of the Games is straightforward enough (be the sole survivor), but the rules are certainly arbitrary and changeable from moment to moment.  Furthermore, the Game creaters are omniscient controllers.  Even if a winner emerges and the populace is entertained, the President could arrange to have the winner executed sometime later.  Some \\"hope\\"! So why participate? Personally, if I'm a contestant and likely to die anyway, I would defy this rigged deathtrap and die on my own terms.  I am surpised that Peeta didn't share that sentiment.<br /><br />It doesn't really matter. THG is a sturdy, involving movie that combines adventure, romance, danger, and social commentary in an agreeable, palatable, almost unsettlingly innocuous way.  Without Lawrence's Katniss, I would have rated THG 3 stars.  With Katniss's complex but commanding character, THG deserves 4 stars.  She manages to make us squirm a little about our ironic enjoyment of kids being compelled to kill each other for the pleasure of a corrupt administration, and to make us reflect a little (though not as much as it could have) about the savage, violent inequalities of our present governments and societies.THG might have become more sluggish under the weight of its movie and literature borrowings.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was an amazing book I couldn't put it down! Very interesting to think of<br />what might have transpired if history was changed.Don't let the size of this book scare you<br />it's a quick read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love the choice for a winning hand. let's face it, sometimes you just wanna play something and win and not think too hard :)
B001993Y2C|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a BSG fan. Don't buy this for someone that isn't already into the show, it's not for everyone. If it is for you, this show has lots of stunning special effects that are well woth seeing in HD. Most HD is a waste of money since FX are limited, not so here: They really splurged on beautiful scenes that need to be in HD to be properly appreciated
B000004166|5.0|The CDs have recrodings from 1962, 1965, and 1967.  Honestly, if you closed your eyes and listen to the music, you wouldn't be able to tell if they were recorded today or almost 50 years ago.  This bargain price CDs are not only affordable, they are actually amazing.  Just buy them.
0525478817|4.0|A beautiful work of literature that conjures long lost emotions. An easy fast paced read, gratifies the mind and heart.
B000001GQ1|4.0|Although this CD was recorded back in 1965 (47 years ago), it doesn't show its age as it had 'original - image bit - processing'.  Anyone who is a collection or Beethoven piano sonatas CDs should go out and buy this CD or just borrow one and listen to it at least once in your life.  It will be worth 80 minutes of your life.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Love this app comes in really handy...Very accurate has never been wrong. Great for all farmers & gardeners. Hope this is helpful to everyone.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I live in Hawaii. so everyone is on other time zones. family,friends,buisnesses,even Tv shows. so this app will be used multiple times a day for me its great I don't have to do the math and worry about daylight savings either. plus it lists the time of sunrise and sunset which will come in handy since I try catching at least one sunset a week
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I bought this season of Big Bang Theory for $14.00 on DVD. I wanted it on Instant Video, cheaper for them I would think, but they wanted to charge me $28.00 for Instant Video. Is that because I now have a Kindle Fire and they just want to soak me?
B004VAFEE2|4.0|In all honesty when I was about 50 pages into this book, I thought that I might put it down and not finish it. I was bored and didn't feel a compulsive need to read on. Nicholas Sparks books usually grab my interest right away and i'm usually completed invested in the story and characters within a few pages, this book took me a little while longer to get invested into, but when I did I found that I really enjoyed the story.<br /><br />I loved the characters of this story, I loved Logan and his passionate, care-free ways and also his past with the marines. I loved Elizabeths' strength and how good of a mother she was, and I also loved her son, Ben. Even Logans' dog, Zeus was a loveable character, he was so smart and attentive.<br /><br />In true Nicholas Sparks form the end of the book held a nice twist of events, that lead me to rate this book 4 instead of the 3 stars I had planned on giving it pretty much all throughout the book. This wasn't my favorite Nicholas Sparks book by a long shot, but I still really enjoyed it and found that it was a nice break from the YA and fantasy books i've been reading a lot of lately. You need a good Nichola's Sparks romance book every once in a while, and this one was no exception.
0439023513|3.0|It is the first book/movie that takes a realistic depiction of violence and its effects on a person. If you want a great adventure and a happy ending, this book is not for you. This book is a real life depicition of survival, violence and the effects that it has on a person's soul. Most characters are either tortured souls, violent agressors, or are unable to sympathisize with others due to their status. There are some that do sacerfice their lives but that is even questioned after so much life is lost.  I found myself really wanting it to be different/really wanting some characters to live but this book mimics real life...not always a happy ending.
B0002UUO9K|4.0|As a child I had watched on live television. I watched again after almost 30 years. full of nostalgia. (note: this product is 4:3 format. not 16:9 version)
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book is not exactly like the Movie made from its idea.  Though, it too is a very moving story about the importance of a young child's need for friends of his own age.  It is also a story about the holocaust and an example of its tremendous costs to humanity.  Deeper, it is a story about what happens to disobedient boys and parents who \\"reap shat they sow\\".  It is a story so captivating that it seems to be true or real, when it is actually fiction, except for its global setting in WWII[[ASIN:8498382548 El nino con el pijama de rayas/ The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (Letras De Bolsillo/ Pocket Letters) (Spanish Edition)]].
B002M5E2DW|1.0|this author is trying to take credit of other famous people thinking, calling it \\"her great secret\\", which of course is nothing new, everybody already knows that been possitive is healthy. the rest of the book is just garbage, not recomended at all, it may work for religion fanatics.
B004LZF2LW|1.0|Why would a clock need to know your location? Last time I checked, my phone changes time zones as I enter a new one. Second, time zones don't change, therefore they shouldn't need to know where I am, but you should know where you are and where you are going. For example, if I am in CA. I know that family in CO are 1 hr ahead of me and the clock (already on your phone) already does this feature.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|For me this was free app of tbe day.<br />Not anything I personally need to use but for those who need a world clock, this should be the one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app very accurate!  I would recommend this app to everyone.,  very easy to read and understand!  a must gave
B004LZF2LW|1.0|The Creation of this app is a failure to all android users around the globe! For anyone who owns a kindle fire like me, should know that the time is shown at least twice when turning the device on. The alarm clock system is just horrible. (since there's only about 5 sounds to wake up too) Last is showing the position of where your located at, Which is just pointless. To all 5 star Moro:Ns who rated this because it has a nice interface setup menu, there's something wrong with you, This app deserves a 1 star :D (mad yet?)
B004VMUS9G|4.0|great app, worked well until update. now I can't turn it off in the morning,  no snooze screen... please fix!  htc evo
B004LZF2LW|4.0|This application appears to have all that I need to manage things between the six timezones that I'll be working in over the coming months. Yet to see how battery is affected, but the neat inclusion of automatically changing the timezone of the phone based on location may come in very handy. Will endeavour to remember to update the review once I've given it a good workout.
0060873027|5.0|It's really a pity Michael Crichton is gone, because he wrote science-based thrillers like no one else.<br /><br />Crichton took scientific leaps already on the drawing boards. He showed them as done deals, fascinated us with possibilities and dramatized what could go wrong if the technology or its owners spun out of control. In books like &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; and &#34;Next&#34; his plots drew on science so timely I'd read about it in the newspapers over the next few years.<br /><br />The other side of his gift was layering so much factual science into his stories. That's what gives them their realistic feel. And you learn as much science from a Crichton book as you do history from a good historical novel.<br /><br />However much work Richard Preston did to finish this manuscript, he succeeded in making the finished product true to Crichton's style.<br /><br />A high-tech company called Nanigen perfects extreme miniaturization created by strong magnetism. That miniaturization works for people, not just objects. and scientists have been shrunk to better explore the teeming world of life at the tiny and microscopic levels in Hawaii's rain forest, where untold numbers of plants and insects, many as yet undiscovered, hold valuable medical secrets.<br /><br />Humans can't stay tiny forever. Their bodies start to break down after a few days if they are not returned to normal size. They've learned how to get along in the microworld, a dangerous and Darwinian place where organisms have evolved countless ways to kill or to defend against being turned into something else's protein source.<br /><br />Nanigen interviews a group of young grad students for work on the project. Unknown to them, company founder Vin Drake has secretly begun developing microbots as weapons. When plans start to leak and a company executive, the brother of one of the students, suspiciously disappears, Drake decides the students, visiting in Hawaii, may already know too much and need to be taken out. He shrinks them and has them released them into the jungle where they'll almost certainly be killed.<br /><br />What's great here is Crichton's depiction of the microscopic world, with great detail particularly about insects. The grad students find themselves in a land teeming and writhing with mites and other tiny life. Every minute shows them new wonders and dangers. They encounter bugs as terrifying monsters, and must tap their own formidable knowledge to defend themselves. And they must suddenly coped with a new world, where they've been thrown without supplies, where small distances seem enormous to them but where they meanwhile have greater strength and speed. They have to cope with their own nasty-nerd fractiousness. Drake, meanwhile, learns they're not dead and starts to track them down.<br /><br />Even the grisly detail when this or that character gets it, is good. Crichton wants the reader to see exactly how things work down there: how an insect  kills and eats its prey, how organisms are broken down, how it feeds its young. He does a great service to entomologists by dramatizing a fascinating world few lay readers even realize exists. Science's knowledge of insects has exploded in recent years and Crichton gives us a taste of it here. I imagine at least one young person somewhere will go into entomology as a result of reading this book.<br /><br />Here's a passage Preston probably had something to do with, in which a bad guy gets killed by a spider:<br /><br />&#34;His body swelled up as the venom pressurized it, until his (body) armor began to make popping sounds, and blood mixed with venom began squirtiing out of the cracks in the armor. As the venom went to work, his spine curved backward and his head whipped back and forth. Neurotoxins in the venom set off a firestorm in his central nervous system. He began to writhe, and went into convulsions, a grand mal seizure. As he seized, his eyes rolled up into head until only the whites showed. Then, abruptly, the whites turned hot-red. Blood vessels had burst in his eyes, as they were rupturing everywhere in his body, for the venom contained digestive enzymes that liquefy flesh. Internal hemorrhages flooded the man's body, until his heart stopped.<br /><br />&#34;The spider venom was Ebola in thirty seconds.&#34;<br /><br />Nice metaphor. And as it so happens, Preston's book &#34;The Hot Zone&#34; chronicled the very scary true story of an Ebola virus outbreak among monkeys in a laboratory.<br /><br />Good read, and about the only sign that it was written before Crichton's death in 2008 is that none of the students have IPhones.<br /><br />Like a lot of Crichton books, the plot isn't that important. The science is the thing.in his body, for the venom contained digestive enzymes that liquefy flesh. Internal hemorrhages flooded the man's body, until his heart stopped.  &#34;The spider venom was Ebola in thirty seconds.&#34;  Nice metaphor. And as it so happens, Preston's book &#34;The Hot Zone&#34; chronicled the very scary true story of an Ebola virus outbreak among monkeys in a laboratory.

The science is the thing.
B000O178BY|5.0|Trent has definitely done it again with this concept album for the end of civilization. Overall, the album is as intellectually stimulating as it is musically stimulating. The jacket itself is rather gorgeous, the lyrics are hard-hitting, and the music is rough and raw. I love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed these books! The writing is wonderful, the storyline and characters make you want to keep reading to find out what will happen to them and their sheltered world. I don't want this story to end....hopefully Wool 6 is in the works! Hugh Howey is my new favorite author!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Enjoyableand long lasting play.  I hope all of G5 's games are this good.  Really loved the adventure portion as well as getting badges and regular play.  Great job, thanks so much.

0545405777|5.0|Epic.  Yes, I described The Hunger Games in one word.  This is one of a handful of books I wish I would have read when it was recommended many moons ago.  My first reading happened in December of 2011 and even that wasn't soon enough.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is smart, strong, and fierce.  It is not just because of her history that she is all of these things, but her insistence to ignore the rules to provide for her mother and sister.  Gale Hawthorne is her best friend.  The boy she began hunting with when her father died.  The boy who knows her secrets.  Peeta Mellark is the boy with the bread.  She doesn't know him very well, but she will soon enough.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading The Hunger Games.  My first time through, I was sitting on the edge of my seat dying to know what would happen next.  I actually purchased all three books and read them in two days.  That is how hooked I was the first time.  The second time around I knew what would happen, but there was still that thrill of not fully remembering the details, but still knowing what was coming.<br /><br />What I really liked was how Katniss could never figure out Peeta's true intentions until the end.  However, I didn't like that she took a lot of things for granted.  Yes she is in a really crappy situation, but I didn't like that she couldn't figure out her feelings.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the thrill of this book.  It has opened my eyes to dystopian novels and I will forever be thankful for that.  I highly recommend this book!

0545405777|5.0|From my wife Sarah: Others have written about the story line so I'll just get right to it. I had read that this was a book designed for teens so I stayed away from it until I saw the movie. I was curious and got the first book. It was amazing, so I got the other two. This is definitely a book for adults too.<br /><br />I can't remember when I've been so moved by a fiction book. The writing in the series was genius, making the characters so alive, real, honest and easy to relate to. The story lines in all three books were absolutely unpredictable and so compelling that I read the trilogy in 4 days, and I'm not a particularly fast reader.<br /><br />As a Scifi fan, I found that the Scifi element was totally satisfying to me. It was so imaginative and new. The author created an entire new earth, designing everything from various cultures to politics, medicine, technology, fashion and more.<br /><br />And ultimately I'd say there was a very deep message that was being communicated. I'll let you experience it for yourself, but it was so well done.<br /><br />The books were exciting though violent and deeply sad at times. It wasn't your typical story where everyone you care about ends up happily ever after. But that's part of what makes it so powerful and worth reading.<br /><br />I would say that parents who have a say in what their kids read should read it first and then decide if it's okay for them.<br /><br />Late teens and adults, these are the best fiction books I've read in a long time, and I highly recommend them.
1440503257|5.0|Bought this on a whim just to see if any of the stuff I read about in the novels would be worth eating. I am pleased to say that almost everything in here is very easy to make and great fun as well. It would be great for a Halloween or Harry Potter themed party.
0321344758|5.0|Steve Krug wrote an excellent book about web usability especially to readers who have little to no experience in web usability. The book was clearly written and easy to understand. Krug also provided the reader with visual illustrations to help the visual learners understand web usability. Having very little web publishing experience, this book helped me a lot.
B007KUFDBY|4.0|Like many films in the Disney library, Treasure Planet was not the financial success Disney expected. And like so many financially unsuccessful Disney films, this one had the potential of spawning a series continuation. The setting, the characters, they're all very nice and memorable. We all remember Long John Silver (a.k.a. Cyborg), Morph, Jim Hawkins, and a few others so I think either sequels or a TV series should have come out of this. The story of Jim Hawkins looking for treasure is well known to us all. Especially those of us who watched Muppet Treasure Island a million times. (\\"We're gonna be rich!\\" \\"We're gonna be dead...\\")<br /><br />But anyway, Treasure Planet is an underrated movie plagued by a difficult production cycle. It was simply too expensive and too difficult to make when the director initially intended to make it so he patiently waited while not-so-subtly whispering into Disney's ear saying \\"Can I make the movie yet? Huh? Huh? Can I? Can I?\\" And so like a child who REALLY wanted the cookie, Disney ultimately decided to make Treasure Planet be they're next feature film at the time. Starring actors that, well, never heard of, except for one that I wouldn't know until YEARS later. Anyone else know that Jim Hawkins in this movie is played by Joseph Gordon Levitt? Yeah, Arthur from Inception anyone? How cool is that? Hey I guess you gotta start somewhere right? So anyway, Disney eventually took the James Cameron's Avatar route and waiting like 10 and finally made Treasure Planet. Which couldn't be made before due to the director's heavy want of mixing 2D animation with 3D environments. Did it succeed? Yeah I'd say they do for the most part. Occasionally it's distracting but ultimately I'd say they did an okay job.<br /><br />While I love Treasure Planet as \\"That Movie I Watched a Hundred Times on VHS\\" it's not without it's fair share of problems. For the record, I never understood why everyone could breathe in space. The aliens I could understand butJim, Silver, and others can just go into space, and just go about their business. Wow those astronauts at NASA are spending too much time and money on equipment because apparently we could breathe in space all this time! Martin Short as Ben overstays his welcome A LOT but he does make the ending scene with the planet about to explode fairly more epic with his worried yelling and screaming. And when they finally open the portal and walk inside the Treasure Room inside the planet? Looking back now, there is an enormous fact that eluded me for years. When they walk through the portal, Flint's only security method of protecting the treasure... was a laser trip wire. Um, oh wow. So you're telling me that in this alternate future, the most creative set-up Flint could think up to protect his treasure, was something you'd see protecting a supermarket or Best Buy? And it's not like the laser was hard to see, it was bright red and everything. So just because they didn't look down, they set off the booby trap. So that whole final act of the treasure falling to the core and the planet blowing up could have ALL been avoided if they looked down, and stepped over the laser. They could have taken the treasure and everyone'd be happy. Major flaw.<br /><br />But I digress, do I still love this movie? Of course I do. Granted it's not the perfect Disney film nor would it be the first I'd show my kids, but there's enough eye-candy, likeable characters, story, and special effects for me to recommend this movie and I really am excited to see it's release on Blu-ray. My family has a 60\\" Samsung HDTV with Surround Sound and a movie like this would really shine. I never expected this movie to come to Blu-ray, and I'm really excited it is. Maybe now we'll see some other underrated movies like Atlantis: The Lost Empire come to Blu-ray. Shame it doesn't come with a Digital Copy though but that's okay. I already bought it on iTunes so anyone who wants this movie on the go can look there. I'm really looking forward to this release and like a good ol' cyborg said, \\"It's got the making of greatness!\\"
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game. can't put it down. play it all the time. very easy to install. love that it's available offline.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|Great quality, unforgettable musics. Really very good. Nobody will be disapointed. Kind of sad to know that is the end of a band. A DVD to collect. I do recommend.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love itw woerks well. I reccomend this. download without worry. thanks. have a nice day.<br /> get this app. works very good
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Taking the birds to space was the next step this game needed.  I love the idea of using gravity to solve the levels.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a fabulous app.  The crashing has been fixed in the latest update. I have played over 100 games and not one problem.  If you previously tried the app and had problems with abrubt crashes often - you should give it another try. The developers of the app have been very responsive
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this because many of the games are quick and easy...nice time wasters. The controls are a little rough on some of the games but I just skip those once I win them.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I would like this app a ton more if only it worked offline. Other than that it's okay. I like that it's free, so I cannot complain.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|idk why a few people posted 1star ratings because this is the best Bible app out there! Don't bother paying for the Bible ebook for Kindle fire when you can get this. I love how you can search the Bible verse you are looking for, then read from there! That feature is EXTREMELY helpful when I am asked to read during my lifegroup. I don't have to flip through pages anymore, because I have this app!<br />  ~M.DiProfio
B0039PPW60|1.0|This mixer seemed like a really good deal, but I have decided to return it after having it for only a few days. The preamps, at least on the specific mixer I bought, are garbage. I had to turn the gain all the way up before anything would even register on the V/U meter. I have tried it with a variety of mics with the same results. I have also read many reviews by people with the same problem. Seems like buying this mixer is a gamble.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been working in data processing since the days of hole punch cards and this is the first time in a long time something has made me go WOW!!  I can use my tablet anywhere and it's like sitting in front of my desktop!  It's portability without a laptop!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|poor writing and frightening premise...you may recognize more than a hint of Twilight. But here there is no gentlemanly, old fashioned sparkly vampire. Here the heroine is enthralled by a controlling, damaged abuser...the kind of man that one thought young women knew to avoid. Be forewarned;  don't believe the hype. and if your daughter expresses an interest in finding a man like this, talk to her. Women are better than this.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I have no disrespect for anyone who dearly loves this show but I just don't happen to be one of them.  My husband loves Firefly and I thought I would give it a shot and watch it and after only 4 episodes I am truly hoping the show gets better and I don't wind up giving up and never seeing it through to the end as it seems a bit tedious at this point.  And yes, I have seen all the episodes of Buffy TVS and Angel and enjoyed them but I can't wait for the show to be over when I watch Firefly.  I dunno what it is ? The dialogue is alright but the Chinese insertions are a bit irritating at times and River seeming to go thru every emotion in a 45 minute episode is a bit much....  Maybe I am jumping the gun or 'ship' after only 4 episodes but I must press on to the end and hopefully it will be worth it.  My husband also has the Serenity movie which I hope is lots better...  So far my favorite characters are Jayne and Wash and Zoe.  Sorry and NO OFFENSE to the MASSIVE adoring fans of this show.  I apologize and will try to press on until the end. Wish me luck!
B0064MT1SA|5.0|Well shot, beautifully acted and overall a wonderful account of an artists life on film. This is how a biography should be done on film. A solid celebration of an artists life.
0385737955|5.0|I am obsessed with books. I go to these Scholastic book fairs that they have and just buy everything and anything. So needless to say I have many many books. Well my 16 year old son picked this one up and started reading it, I was thrilled and very intrigued. He isn't known to read books for pleasure.<br />When he asked me to buy the 2nd and 3rd books in this trilogy, I was ecstatic! Now I am reading this book. It is awesome! Its one of those books that don't make you sleppy at night. You want to keep reading it to find out what happens next but at the same time you don't want it to end. Last time I felt this way was with the Hunger Games. LOVE IT so far......My son finished all 3 of the books in the Maze Runner Trilogy in a week. Its THAT good!
B006PTL1GC|2.0|I wantd this to be better, the cast  was amazing...and yet such an interesting subject was presented in such a boring way, it felt like a T.V. movie. Very uninspired and overall a shame. The few scenes where there was actual sex involved were far and few, and felt staged. Not much more to say other than its  renter at best. Again, I love all three actors...but they were given nothing to do.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Does as it's stated great app and people stop your wining. Shows the correct time where I'm at looks great very user friendly. Everyone that has issues with permissions honestly you have no clue and take word of mouth before investigating for yourself what they really do. Stay away trolls.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This box set is beautiful...the blue ray transfer top notch and overall a great product. I love everything about this show...it's extreme violence, its in your face nudity and its beautiful to look at. This is a period show done right...I only wish season two was available right now.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A real eye opener. One learns so much. A story of faith and survival.  Thank you so much for sharing the story!
B006W0QOF2|1.0|The movie seemed to have a good theme but the lack of dialogue tanked it. For perhaps 15 minutes of the start of the movie, the main characters only line is \\"what floor\\". How the hell do you develop a character, to where people will like them, doing that? The chase scenes were great and some of the violent scenes of shootings and fights were pretty good but NOTHING tied it together. A better time would be had watching \\"epic fail\\" videos on the internet. One of your typical movies where the writers/director/producers try and get out of the box and fail to buy a box cutter. Here is a clue, people want to see the good guy prevail (unless your bad guy is Darth Maul), they want to see the good guy get the girl, they want to see the good guy get rich or do something with the money they gained. They want away from the reality of having a spouse they hate, bills they can't pay, and a boring life. They want to smile and laugh, not think...\\"yeah that guy has the same luck as me\\", when the credits roll.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|American Horror Story is the show that makes your mind keep turning even after the episode is over. It keeps you hooked and compels you to keep watching. It has all the elements you would look for in a good horror story and even beats most horror movies I've seen these days. I love the tone of the show, the Gothic realistic feel of it. The characters are very well rounded out, the parents facing the issues of cheating and loss, as well as their daughter facing her teenage angst. I frankly can't wait for a second season despite the change of characters and location, i am still really amazed at how well the first season was. The show kept you wondering and guessing all the way to the end. i won't lie, there were a few things i thought they could have wrapped up better, or even wrapped up at all, that they didn't but that didn't detract from the overall show. I will be watching season 2!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good game but could have a better variety of different types of games likes sports or puzzle type games overall it good
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I love  Angry Birds as much as the next guy, but the creativity of the levels in CTR and CTR: Experiments is really enjoyable. I may change my tune (I'm about halfway through Experiments), but sometimes I wish it was a little more challenging, with more multi-step solutions. That said, this remains my favorite Android game series.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Recently held a surprise \\"50th\\" birthday for my sister...played \\"Adele 21\\" and everyone enjoyed it, even grandma.  Hope she has a fantastic career with many more popular CD's.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great series of books. Hard to put down once you start the series so be prepared. Wish there was less sexual content. Not needed in these books. Can be confusing with all the characters at first, but hang in there!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This whole experience was great! The product was packaged well, the price was wonderful and well worth it, and it got to me in a timely manner. The disk were all in great shape. I had a great experience with this seller. Really couldn't ask for much more.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I had heard of Anita Moorjani's NDE and read everything about it on the website. However, i had no intention of buying the book as i felt it would be the same story repeating again. Then a few days just before her book release i read an interview from Wayne Dyer where he had mentioned the book and that's when i got up and took notice. I looked it up on Amazon and the book hadn't been released yet, it would be another few days; after it's release i called all our local bookstores and they didn't have it yet. To order on Amazon would mean to have to wait another 10 days. Then i noticed that it was available on Kindle. I downloaded the App on my Macbook and finally read the book.<br />It was such a beautiful read, i specially loved the part where she says that her disease wasn't because of her karmas but because of her fears. That part really resonated with me, i felt her story very close to my heart as i had been feeling the same fears of judgement myself. It carries a beautiful message to the world to simply follow your hearts and not be waylaid by societal pressures. I'm waiting for the physical book to be available here so i can gift a few friends.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well yea this game is fun but they should give you more games to start off with. at least twelve games to start off with
1612130283|5.0|Love, love, love this book!! It was actually my first erotica book so I was a bit unsure in the beginning. I was completely hooked! I read all 3 books in 4 days. I could not put them down! I am currently reading them again. You will fall in love with Christian!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit that when I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I was a bit hesitant to buy this book. Now, here I am writing one more to be added to the pile of 5 stars.<br /><br />The story describes a colony of persons who live in a post-apocalyptic future in an underground silo. The silo has strict rules of governing those who live within the walls, discouraging any thoughts of the poisonous world outside. Though a woman named Juliette becomes the main focus, I think the main character is really humanity and the natural desire to explore, to dream, to find truth and understanding.<br /><br />I'd love to share more, but I fear it would ruin the story. Now, stop reading reviews and go buy the damn book. Seriously, it'll be the best $4.99 you've ever spent on an ebook.
B000I8ERVM|5.0|This is a good movie based on fact... yes the story is true, and adapted well for the screen. If you read Father Amorths book<br />\\"An Exorcist Tells His Story\\" you might well be shocked and look at this in a different light.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a very compact little sharpener from Smith's.  For the price it is great, some inexpensive little products end up being just junk, but this is a well made worthwile item to have.  It is the only sharpener I need when I am on the go or on a trip, hike, etc.  It gets the ol' A+ from me!
B0060AY6FO|2.0|Even a good mystery writer such as P.D. James can run astray in taking the characters and background from the most famous Austin book<br />and trying to use them in a mystery story. ELIZABET BENNET  is dull and her great love and now husband offers litle of charm or intellect. Talking of events that occurred in the original P&P forces the reader to compare styles.  Guess who wins? I forced mysef to finish the book.
0545405777|4.0|It's a fun book...but mostly for kids.  And that's exactly for whom these books were written.  For adults who think it's deeper than it is, you need to go read actual books written for actual adults.  This is not that.  It's fun and it's interesting and it's a great page-turner.  But it's NOT brilliant adult literature.  If you have a friend over 15 who says otherwise, they need to read more.  This is a fun book.  VERY enjoyable.  You'll tear through it in a day or two.  Ditto for the other two books.  But if you're looking for deep, meaningful reading?  Go elsewhere.  This is a fun action book and has a strong female lead.  Give this to your kids instead of \\"Twilight\\" and you'll be happy.  In fact, if you read it at the same time as your kids, you can bond.  There are far worse things your kids could be reading.  And, honestly, adults could do far worse, too.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|You immediately get a taste of the difference between the original and American versions in the opening credits which were typical American overbearing with it's dramatic CGI and accompanying music. Within the movie itself viewers of the original are most apt to be put off by other differences such as the  exaggerated tats, piercings and makeup as well as the exaggerated robotic emotional portrayals. The difference is analogous to seeing entertainment oriented fake wrestling vs. the real wrestling. The editing was disjointed as our characters seemed to jump from scene to scene despite the distances. The acting was a little too stiff. Lisbeth's and Mikael's computer skills seemed like what an older, computer illiterate person might engage in while doing a goog search. The sex scenes seemed to be added solely to gain market share and just didn't add to the story. Lisbeth's and Mikael's problem solving research were a far-fetched not believable. Their physical actions seemed dumb e.g. Lisbeth sneaking up on someone in loud clunking shoes on marble floors was just a \\"sure you are\\" or Mikael sneaking around and out of the house only to get caught. A \\"dummy\\" of a supposedly smart investigator. You didn't feel as if she was the one riding the motorcycle. Just a roller coaster, uneven ride of a movie.
0062119044|2.0|Every time someone tells me how much they love this book, it's typically one of my pretentious friends who thinks he is smarter than he actually is.<br /><br />The book is dreadful, and in many ways.  The characters are unrealistic.  The plot is silly.  The way the title character goes about his \\"school shooting\\" is laughable.  SPOILER ALERT: Do you really think that, in today's day and age, a kid could go on a mass killing spree with a BOW AND ARROW?  The author obviously knows nothing about archery or the logistics of bows and arrows.<br /><br />The narrator is an idiot who speaks as if she is teaching a university grammar course at all times.  Her husband is an ignoramus who doesn't see the sun before his eyes.  And the worst part is that the titular character is so stupidly unrealistic that the serious tone of the book is lost in the ridiculous Hannibal Lechter parody that he becomes.  Oh, kids are \\"Born\\" evil?  I didn't realize that this was a silly horror book.  The author has always stated that it was a serious character study.  Sure.  And snore.<br /><br />But none of that matters.  It's not really a book so much as it's a big, long showpiece for the author to show all of the readers how great she is with verbiage.  She owns a thesaurus and wants you to know she used it.  Characters speak in ways that people simply do not speak.  The narrator is not a person so much as a fictional novel narrator, which is jarringly clear all throughout the book.  People simply don't speak this way.  And, if you meet people who say they do (or comment on this review by saying they do), they'll be those pretentious people who want to tell you how smart they know they are.  Well, just like Lionel Shriver is not nearly as clever as she thinks, people who love this book aren't nearly as smart as they believe they are, either.  So, when you see someone comment on this review about how intelligent they are, just know that they are not.<br /><br />It's not a good book.  Slow, overlong, plodding, and just plain...well...stupid.<br /><br />Shriver recently said she likes to write \\"unlikable\\" characters.  It's not that.  She just writes awful books.  With characters that don't really exist in the real world.  Go read \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and you'll find more realistic characters than you'll find in this book.  In fact, go read \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" and you'll still be more successful.<br /><br />I only give it two stars because the idea is clever.  Without a doubt, I'll give her props for the story.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Kudos to the motion capture personnel, modelers, compositors, animators, script writers, texture programmers, voicing actors, directors and producers of course and anyone else left out. Snowy (Milou) was great in his mannerisms, activities such as digging up and carrying about a dinosaur bone and in his nuanced doggy sounds. The burning ship and the sea to sand transition were visually fantastic. The attention to detail (always a sign of quality) as represented by the views through the magnifying glass and the breaking bottles were beyond the call of duty. Creative storytelling that flowed easily between scenes. Action that never seemed to stop.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Wow, just an awesome read, watched the tv show first then decided to read the books and I'm so glad I did. So many things going on, so many great stories and characters it's like Dallas set in middle earth with all the drama, whee lings and dealings, back stabbings, sex and blatant rawness to the narrative. I can't wait to start reading the rest of the series now. Just an  awesome book.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is a cool app for those who must communicate with people all over the world or those who travel a lot. As I routinely communicate with people in Europe, India and the Far East this gives me an easy way to check what the time is in their location all on one screen.
B003PPDIC4|5.0|Maybe one of the greatest sci fi books ever written, simple to read and relate too, obviously not set in a fantasy galaxy far far away, but much more closer to home and where we are at now in human technology. This book is so much more better than  the movie and I can't wait to start reading the next books. Couldn't put it down once I started reading and pretty much read it in one sitting.
B004LZF2LW|3.0|ok app but I would like to see only my local time and swipe on widget to see others. also like that I can touch location and see seconds but NEED that option in standard view.  please add this! then I will increase re jewelry stars...

B004FOA84A|4.0|this game was challenging.it had awesome hidden clues that were kinda hard to find. my only. probelom was how I couldent see wat was right in front of me. I love challenging games for my kindle fire.
0439023483|4.0|I came to this book a wary of all the buzz surrounding it -- the last time I read something my sister recommended me it was Twilight, and that was a disaster...<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Suzanne Collins's \\"Hunger Games\\" delves into more realistic themes and issues than other popular teen reads (Harry Potter, Twilight). Whereas Harry Potter and Twilight deal mostly with personal issues -- making friends, finding love, gaining confidence -- Katniss, the main character, begins with her strong personality already formed. Katniss's strength despite harsh conditions reminded me of the characters in Margaret Peterson Haddix's Shadow Children series, who lived in a world where every third child was supposed to be executed because of overpopulation. Katniss was a solid character, but her relationship with Peeta felt very forced, even knowing that it was a ruse to begin with, which I think was the major weakness of the novel. It felt like it was just thrown in there to appease teen readers, which was a little disappointing but what can you expect? *sigh*<br /><br />What impressed me was Hunger Games's critique of the vanity, selfishness, and wastefulness of modern existence. Katniss comes from one of the least wealthy districts and is forced to fight for her life in order to entertain people with higher social positions and more money. The districts are stratified by industry. Katniss's district (the lowest) is mining, and the others in ascending order are: agriculture, livestock, textiles, lumber, transportation, power, fishing, electronics, heavy industry, and the Capitol produces luxuries. The basic idea here is that the people in the least essential industries hold the most power. Doesn't this seem familiar? It seems to reflect the way football players and actors are given high salaries while the proletariat are given no respect and very few opportunities for advancement (sure, you can argue that education up to grade 12 is free, but whatcan you do without a college degree anymore?).<br /><br />I applaud this book for preparing young (and old) people to recognize and cope with the problems that the wealth gap creates in society, and for rightly portraying as disgusting people who spend all their time trying to make themselves look beautiful and keep themselves entertained while the world goes to s***. I think we're on the edge of a real change in the way people become more aware of the ways they are inadvertently exploiting others, as books like this, movements like Occupy, and initiatives like Fair Trade bring the struggles of the lower classes into mass consciousness. Basically, the new ethics that is emerging is the ethics of not consuming more than you need, and finding a way to share the bounty with those that are less fortunate (okay, well, it's not exactly new, but it's becoming more important as we start to realize that consuming to excess is both physically and mentally degrading to ourselves -- think obesity and Kardashians).<br /><br />Being socially conscious isn't an easy thing to do (because it involves breaking habits that we love to indulge), but it's a healthy thing to aspire to both at an individual and societal level.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book is Amazing. It's the kind if book you don't wanna put down until you are done with the whole thing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My 21 year old daughter pressed me to read the series. I thought it sounded like it was trying to be Twilight (which she also talked me into reading). I LOVED the series. I don't see what the media can criticize. I love every character actor, a vey rare occurrence. Perfect fits.  Read it, see it.
1466401885|2.0|This book seemed to have generally good reviews, so I ordered it.  In the beginning, I was very engrossed.  But once the \\"star-crossed\\" lovers got together, it started going downhill and became extremely repetitive, dull and dragging. I'm an adult, so I can read this and not be influenced by it.  But I agree with other readers who say this encourages unhealthy relationships for young women.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you like the books this is the best book to film I have ever seen. For nonreaders, if you like this pick up a book!
B003N5VOUO|2.0|Totally improbable plot that goes for easy emotional release.  Preaches to the converted, we all know that not all muslims are terrorists and we all know that in every society there is a fringe that is still tribal and takes any excuse to harass the different in this case the muslims are easy targets but U.S. society should not be condemned as a whole for the actions of a tiny minority of bigots and miscreants.  The center piece of the story is the killing of the stepson of our hero by a group of playground bullies, but we know bullies take any excuse and if the kid was gay, mexican, muslim, or just weird he would have given them an excuse to be attacked, so the film overblows an incident that even though is very condemnable it is still commonplace in any society not beacuse of racism but because there are bullies.  I found the central character or \\"hero\\" to be annoying, kind of a Indian-Muslim Forrest Gump and I was not a fan of the original Forrest Gump which is a character of irony while in this movie is just preachy.  The only rescuable aspect was the mosque scene in which Khan confronts the islam radical preacher and tells him that islam is in reality a religion of peace which as all religions I believe it is.  In this scene we see the real reason for extremism is not a sense of moral outrage or religious introspection but simply machismo, this is the macho muslims are comfronted and in their minds treated with contempt by the rest of society being Jews, Christians, savage Hindus, etc. and they have to retalliate to alliviate their sense of hurt pride and diminished manhood.  To be honest those are the same reasons people become Communists, Radical Islamists, Radical White Power, etc. just a sense of intollerance brought about by resentment and envy of people that in their concept have a better position in life without deserving it and that is called Social Resentment. The movie does not offer new insights and the characters are annoying, I do ot recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the game has good graphics and customization. there are no errors or random crashing. the ads are unobtrusive. great free app.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|I've had this case on my phone for a few days now and i'm not really impressed.  There are a lot of rough edges on this case.  I was hoping the edges would be a bit more rounded but everything seems to come to a point.  However, the case does feel mighty sturdy and looks like it might just protect the phone in case of an accidental dropping.
B004LZF2LW|1.0|mazing how so many 5 star reviews show up the day it goes free from people who have supposedly been using it for ages and love it....
0062082353|5.0|Fascinating but intense read<br /><br />Chris Kyle does an excellent job of relating his early years growing up in Texas, his training as a SEAL, his experiences as a sniper in four deployments in Iraq, his interrelationships with his wife Taya, his relationship with his children, and finally how he deals with the stresses and demands of his job. When reading this you find out how the government identifies through training those people who have the mental toughness to rationalize killing other humans. By using intimidation and psychological  methods the military turns men into people who believe that the enemy is completely evil, therefore when they kill it is justified because they are saving the lives of their team members and fellow soldiers. Throughout the book Chris states he is a Christian, and feels no remorse when he kills insurgents.  In fact, he is in competition with his fellow snipers to see who can tally the most scores. War, it seems to me, is hell, and in this book Kyle does a good job of  indicting it. Through reading his personal account you find out how the military turns a decent man into someone who kills with satisfaction.  It is a chilling, but fascinating read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I continue to be in awe of this man and his 50 shades, as I was in book 1. Both Ana and Christian have captured my attention and my heart.  I feel drained as I read because the writer has kept me on the edge of my seat with both the intimacy of their relationship and the overall tone of the book.  I will not soon forget this couple, and I am onto book 3. And am starting to feel sad that there may be no more after that. WONDERFU!!!!
0307454568|4.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the final installment of the Millenium crime series by Stieg Larsson. The book can't stand alone and knowledge of the first two is a necessity. The book pick ups where The Girl Who Played with Fire left off; Salendar is alive, and in Sahlgrenska Hospital<br /><br />The stakes are a lot higher this book. People of significant power don't want Blomkvist or Salendar to get information to the public. As usual, Blomkvist is clever and finds ways to out maneuver his opposition. There are constant diversions and twists that at times make the book more emotional than the first two Millenium novels.<br /><br />The novel is bloated with characters, towns, and various names. Although about the same length as the first two novels in the series, readers may find the book mentally taxing. Larsson goes on and on into reports and information that is overly detailed. The story often oscillates between intense action sequences and long bouts of research.<br /><br />Although Larsson originally planned to write 10 novels, this was the last full novel he wrote. His partner, Eva Gabrielsson, claims to have the coveted fourth novel in the series (which she does not plan to release). Whether anyone will take over the series, remains fittingly, a mystery.<br /><br />Sony intends on filming The Girl Who Played with Fire and Hornet's Nest together. The scheduled release is late 2013.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I will be brief just saying I have never read a book as  riveting and exhaustingly hot.  Cristian Grey is without a doubt the most intriguing and hottest male character I have ever had the pleasure of spending time with.  He is absolutely 50 Shades and you can't help but fall in love with him just as Ana does.  She is magnificent as well. Ana is one brave, beautiful and intelligent woman and when she sticks it out trying to get thru all of Christian's 50 Shades, we are rewarded with a totally engaging and captivating read.  I guarantee you won't be able to put it down and you will be equally anxious to read the rest of the Trilogy.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|this is a great game,  but after a couple of levels it gets harder.especial when everything becomes bigger than it should be
B003PIUC02|5.0|If you like movies like 300, Troy, and Gladiator, then by all means buy this show, it sucked me in after the first episode and I'm now going to buy the 2 newer seasons that are out.  This show was worth every dollar I spent and I can't say enough good things about it.  (There is alot of nudity of both genders in it, so if that bothers you then you won't want to watch this)
B0055SWM08|5.0|By far the best puzzle game for android!  There is nothing like it, its relaxing, yet frustrating at the same time.
1612130283|5.0|Loved this book. It was the first of its kind that I'd read, and loved it.  I immediately bought books 2 and 3 and finished them in a few days.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It only took me two weeks to read all three books from this series and I am not a fast reader. I couldn't put this book down! I actually saw this book being reviewed on the Today Show by a bunch of late 30 to early 40 something women in the same book group. I looked it up online and one reviewer wrote that it was \\"S&M light\\". I wasn't familiar with the term, but I gave it a try. I am so glad I did. I really enjoyed the character development and how that related back to the story line development. Fifty Shades of Grey was my favorite book out of the three, hands down.<br /><br />I found it hard to believe that Ana was literally clueless about sex in the beginning, but it did lend to making Christian's deviant behavior more shocking to see it through her eyes. The sex scenes were hot and totally got me thinking!<br /><br />Will this end up being a classic like Wuthering Heights? Probably not, but that's not to say that it's not a fantastic book. If you're looking for literary depth and dimension, you're not going to find it here. That's what I don't understand about the negative reviews. If you don't like this genre of books, don't read it. You know it's not for you. Personally, I prefer books that don't have hidden meanings.<br /><br />In the end, I would totally recommend this book to all of my friends. I actually want to recommend it to my book group, but I think it's only available in e-reader format. I can't wait to see the movie too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app. easy to use. nice for filling time. very clear instructions. having a great time playing. would recommend to my friends.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Started slow, but once it gained steam, it was a good read.  Grim and depressing at times, but realistic and edgy.  Will be very interesting to see how Lionsgate converts this book to the screen.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Great graphics with really good gameplay where you really have to think about the solution without being to difficult.There were a couple of scenarios that I had to run through more than a couple of times to finish them but I never felt frustrated instead I wanted to finish them more than ever.Overall fantastic game that I would highly recommend to anyone.Take care.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|This novel is tense, and exciting. You will not be able to figure out anything beforehand which is the problem with most thrillers.<br />The characters are well thought out, and you will marvel at the many layers of deception that these characters have made for themselves.<br />Not only one of the better thrillers I've read in years, but quite possibly one of the better 'spy' novels ever written.<br /><br />Excellent. Do yourself a favor and read it, you won't be sorry. I am looking forward to this authors next novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is like wow no body would think a game could be this awsome. you should buy it really.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|At a minimum this film is as good as Annie Hall.  I think it is better.  All the other reviews here give enough detail, so I won't repeat.  I have been a Woody Allen fan for over 30 years and I think he should be declared a national treasure for both the U.S. and Paris!  Good job Woody!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Worth every penny &amp; then some!!Angry Birds FTW!You have to try this you'll fall in love or I should say lust.Who doesn't love angry birds?
1451627289|5.0|This is the first Stephen King novel I've read and it makes me feel like I've missed a lot.<br /><br />The content is difficult, but King is a master. He's recreated the late 50's and early 60's... Even if it were not centered on a history changing event, the book is worth reading for its encapulation of the time period. King desribes the country of this time through the people, their dialog, their outlook, what they did and how they interacted.<br /><br />The story goes apace, and there are no clues as to how this will work out.  Even though some parts are wordy, the 800+ pages read quickly.  Some parts are page turners and the climax will have you on edge.<br /><br />I believe the interpretation of Oswald and his daily life is spot on.<br /><br />At the end, there is an all too short summation on Stephen King's view of the conspiracy theories and his take on a future had Kennedy lived.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun especially since you do other games to unlock the rest of how Many other games you have to unlock.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Let's see, no character development, zero acting, no chemistry between the principle characters, long, awkward stares in place of dialogue (that's artistic, that is!), a plot stolen from \\"The Transporter\\" and achingly slow plot development. And, just like in an M. Night Shayamalan movie, you can count the number of times anyone blinks on one hand. But, of course, someone will slap an \\"art\\" label on it and rave about how artistic it is.<br /><br />What a load of crap. Don't waste your time on this piece of crap film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and cool!!! so neat&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl; its so cool and great and funny<br />please make more!!!!!!!!! :) I just love it
B005K17RU0|5.0|This application is great. It is also pretty dang accurate at least for my area. I have had no negative issues with this app.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|Es un film que pone en escena 4 personalidades, en donde cada una presenta sus 2 extremos: lo tolerante a lo violento, lo gracioso a lo depresivo etc.<br /><br />Excelente Film.
0553386794|5.0|This series, along with The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, are more than just swords and sorcery, hero rescues the girl and kills the dragon kind of fantasy.  This book is a realistic look into a fantasy style world.  The complexity of character and interweaving of the stories is so compelling that when I picked it up 10 years ago I thought if I ever get to pitch to HBO I am pitching this.  Well it is a TV series on HBO now and I do not begrudge them for doing it without me because the adaptation is fantastic.<br /><br />Here is a little blog post I wrote on my favorite mystery of the series:  Who is Jon Snow's mother?<br /><br />[...]

I was happy the day i got from radiant I was in the first 100 to order and got it with Neal and Mikes autographs. So i popped it right in and listened straight thru. and to be honest i wasn't real impressed . i guess i was expecting a full out  progrock record.its not that. so I listened, really listened the next time and i found  it better than an all out progrock record and after the third this is a real good record .i saw someone say its like a beard recording not one i ever herd and i have them all.and it NOT Transatlantic or adrenalin mob what it is in my opinion, is a very good flying colors  CD.every song is tight and streamlined and very well played.after the third listen i ripped it onto my computer so i can listen to  it when I'm working in my office burned it so i cad keep a copy in the car for my business trips.this is a great work in every way .So My advice get it listen and im sure you will be looking forward to the next as i am.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|Highly recommend it for camping and for flashlight enthusiasts, very bright and can light up well over one hundred yard, good spill and focus, the material is durable, good improvement from the Fenix TK40 don't have to cycle through alot of modes with just one button, having the buttons placed at throat of the light helps prevent unintentional activation of the light which was kind of the problem I had with TK40 working as a security guard, not to mention runs on inexpensive AA batteries, I would recommend rechargeable bats as it will save you money.<br />Must have and worth every dime for those who love flashlights and tactical stuff!
B004LZF2LW|1.0|Look, yesterdays faotd was okay, but not great. now your giving us a clock when we already have one on our phones and kindle fires. I know you can do better. why not do angry birds space or some thing that would have a whole lot of good reviews. Not a clock, not a painting app, and not any thing that kids and adults think deserve a one star. some good apps to put up for faotd is bird jerk, angry birds space, cataline, and any other good game. Another thing, I don't really don't care about knowing the time in other country's. so its just plain use less for me.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|\\"Puss in Boots\\" is a wild and wonderful romp through Fairy Tale land. Puss must clear his past in his old town after a falling out with an ex-friend named Humpty Dumpty. When he encounters Kitty Softpaws, he finds she is his equal both in dancing and in other skills.He also finds his ex-friend is seeking his help in obtaining the Key to reaching the Golden Goose from two nefarious characters, Jack and Jill, who live in a wagon driven by wild boars. When they do get the key,they find the Golden Goose, but unleash a monster that threatens the town where Puss grows up. In the style of Shrek,this is hardly traditional, but very funny.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Before reading the book I was told that the first half of the book was boring and hard to understand.  I read it and quite frankly, I didn't find it hard to follow (this could be a result of me reading, 'The Girl Who Played with Fire' and 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest', before having read this one.<br /><br />The story/plot was well executed, the characters all played an important role - they were never boring.<br /><br />With that said, after having read the book I can not understand why there was so much excitement over, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.  Yes, it is a good book but certainly not worth the hysteria the came with it.  For me, the last 2 books were much better.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|it is an ok game. but l whenever you run out of coins/gems adds pop up and ask you to pay for Thekla's for $100.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so so awesome. I love it. it teaches anyone to cook. my favorite recipe is the carrot cake.

B0071QIN00|5.0|This app is a bit gruesome,there is never any blood but after the rider dies there is a little twitching but no screaming. It is very challenging,fun for all ages. Boys and girls could enjoy it. You do not get to choose your own bike or rider just your level. You can not skip a level,you have to complete one to get to another. You can earn up to three stars by getting them on high jumps and things. Your stars do not effect how fast you make it to the next level,you just hage to complete it. When the bike crashes, the game is over. Sometimes it will let you start over from a checkpoint if yo uhage made it far enougu. It is very fun and challenging.
1400034205|3.0|While I have never been an avid reader, I read a fair amount.  Perhaps a book a month.  Yet, somehow I got through high school and college without ever having read Somerset Maugham.  Recently, at the ripe old age of 62, I happened to see the old film version (starring Tyrone Power) of the novel, and walked away quite disappointed.  The crux of the story, it seemed to me, was the character Larry spending time in \\"the East\\" and becoming...well something akin to enlightened.  Yet, in the film, that segment of the story hardly took up 10 minutes, but perhaps that was the 1940s...a time when talking about enlightenment wasn't looked up too favorably in American pop cinema.  Although disappointed in the film, I found the story intriguing, so I came to Amazon to find the book, expecting it to be fulfilling...after all, Maugham is one of the great writers...isn't he?<br /><br />I must admit that I now walk away from the reading the novel equally disappointed, though for different reasons.<br /><br />First, it seems to me that there are really two stories here.  The story of the vainglorious Elliot, who nevertheless has a heart of gold...for people of the right class.  The story of Elliot was portrayed rather well in the film, with Clifton Webb playing the park.  In the book, Maugham richly fills in so much more about Elliot.  It's good reading.  I enjoyed this part of the book immensely.  The second story centers around Larry, a young man who is dissatisfied with life, and seeks...well perhaps he isn't actively seeking enlightenment...but he is seeking something more, and it sets him slightly apart from other people.  And here's one of my key problems with this book -- while both story lines involve mostly the same characters, to me they should have been two separate books or at least short stories.  I don't see an emotional bonding between the two stories.<br /><br />Second, and this is my fault, this is very old-fashioned writing.  If you like Baldacci and Grishom, then you probably won't like this style of writing.  It took me quite a while to get more into it.<br /><br />Third, here Maugham fills in all the mystery about Larry becoming enlightened.  But, he doesn't do it until the very end of the book.  Since that part of the story was the real reason I read the book, I found this rather frustrating, particularly as I had come to the conclusion that the book wasn't going to deal with it anymore than did the film.  But what I dislike about how Maugham handled it, was that he worked around through almost the entire book, then telling that part of the story in flashback.  The use of flashbacks in films is a technique I find far overused.  Occasionally it's effective, but usually it's better unused.  In a book, where you are slowly working your way through a story, it's even more deadly.  Let's put it this way...there was a temptation to toss the book.<br /><br />To me, Maugham missed the boat here.  He had a really great story line...perhaps two independent story lines...but he told his story badly.<br /><br />Well, Maugham will get another chance with me.  I also ordered \\"The Painted Veil\\".  Perhaps he will redeem himself in my eyes.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|the graphite carrying case is excellent. i like th protective lining, for one. the zipper works smoothly, without jamming-up. the exterior is both rugged and nice looking. i get a lot of compliments on the case.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy. I was a little unsure as it was an author I was unfamiliar with and the lure of the great deal I got on it was enough to persuade me to purchase it. I am not sorry! The writing level and story line were captivating. I could not put it down and read the entire thing straight through. There was definitely lack of sleep involved! Kudos to the author for an excellent series. I cried almost non stop and that is unusual for me. I felt a range of emotions that I have not experienced with a writer in years. I cannot say enough about the skill of this writer! Thank you!!
B004FQX59I|5.0|This version - \\"Directors Cut\\" is the same as the extended VHS release in the mid 90's. Whether one believes the \\"Lone Gunmen Theory\\" or not, this movie is great entertainment. I normally do not watch Kevin Costner's movies; but he totally absorbes the persona of Jim Garrison; which adds to the credibilty of Oliver Stone's storyline. JFK won the Oscar for Film Editing; and Cinematography, the expertise of these two departments allowed Stone to flawlessly blend fact with fiction. Another treat is the short screen time of Donald Sutherland portraying \\"X\\"; these few moments go a long way in helping to shape his perception of the events in Dallas.
B0041B785Y|5.0|Djent.<br />You're either new to it or you're not.<br />I'm a newbie I'll admit.<br />My intro to Djent was Born of Osiris' \\"Discovery\\" then followed by the amazing Vildhjarta.<br />I decided to check out the originators Meshuggah.<br />Sadly, this is another band that has managed to fly under my metal radar since 1991.<br />\\"Bleed\\" got my attention a while back so I decided to finally take the plunge with their new album.<br />Simply amazing musicianship, vocals, production.<br />Booming, amazing riffs.<br />Stand out tracks...<br />All of them lol, and that's saying a lot considering that with 99% of cd's you're lucky to get one or two decent songs.<br />The title track is a sludgy destroyer.<br />I love \\"Demon's Name\\"...a lot like \\"Bleed\\".<br />\\"Do Not Look Down\\" is brutally groovy with an amazing lead.<br />\\"Sun\\"....total doom.<br />\\"Hurt\\" just the opposite of \\"Sun\\"...mega thrash attack.<br />\\"Marrow\\" a mid-paced chunker with another spectacular lead.<br />\\"Bones\\" awesome intro and a title that reminds me of old Carcass songs.<br />\\"Swarm\\" another thrashy track with strange dynamics.<br />\\"Demiurge\\" has a groovy head bangable riff.<br />\\"Vigil\\" kind of a strange way to end the disc. An instrumental that is good to lose yourself in.<br />What I really enjoy about Djent is the fact that it's still tech death without being so overwhelming that you can't listen to it.<br />Some bands simply overpower the listener with time shifts and different dynamics without letting an actual song come through.<br />Meshuggah manages to appease my ADD side without losing me in a sea of meaningless riffs.<br />Incredible album.<br />Recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I know this book is getting a lot of mixed reviews but I personally enjoyed it a lot. It's kind of a messed up \\"love\\" story. There is a lot of sex, so if you get uneasy while reading about sex this is not the book for you.<br /><br />I absolutely loved everything about the book though. Ana's personality is so opposite to my own so I thoroughly enjoyed reading about someone who is so different.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down, honestly. I read it in a few days! Already half way through the second one.
0553801473|5.0|A lot of plot progressing.  Mostly great.  Partly amazing. Not as great as the previous ones in the series. Definitely worth the wait!
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This app is very handy for people who travel on vacation and need a quick glance at the time when calling back home. It also can be very useful for people who cruise since you tend to enter different time zones within the span of 1 week. The app seems very fluid and works well on ICS Galaxy Nexus. It is also very sleek looking.

1118026470|5.0|Somebody recommended me this book and mentioned that the book is worth every penny... and he was right. It is well written and it is a great reference book for anybody interested in information security, especially in the attack and pentest area. I'll recommend it just because of the content provided in chapter 21, \\"A Web Application Hacker's Methodology\\". It is a very comprehensive methodology that can be used as guidance to perform attack & pen to a web application.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Metallica and Megadeth. The two bands have been linked since their inception. They went their own ways, there can be no doubt about that, with the differences becoming more glaring after Metallica released '. . . And Justice for All.' While Metallica seems more open to outside influences from producers and music trends, and trying to cater their sound in what seems like an attempt to apeal to more people, Megadeth is, well, Megadeth. Almost 30 years after Megadeth's first recordings, they have released an album that is pure and unadulterated Megadeth. No BS, no comprimise.<br /><br />If you have been a fan of theirs from the beginning, like I am, TH1RT3EN rules. It is like finding an old friend from high school and picking up where you left off at as though a day has not passed, and like any great band, from the first notes you can tell by the sound who you are listening to. For those new to Megadeth and don't want your grandfather's 'Peace Sells,' 13 is a good example of what you are missing.  Topical and with wisdom that has really always been there in the lyrics, 13 deserves to be in every metal fan's collection. It is an awesome album. Period.

B004LZF2LW|5.0|I bought this app last year and use daily.  great when I have to schedule meetings for a global organization.  I paid 2.99 for it and would gladly have paid double that.  the time sliding feature is great and goes beyond a travelers clock.

0545405777|5.0|I first read the Hunger Games after it was recommended to my by one of my friends. I had heard that there was going to be a movie in a couple months and decided to give it a try - what did I have to lose? A couple of my friends had read it and liked it, and it seemed good to try something new. I figured I would probably at least find it entertaining.<br /><br />I was blown away.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is compelling, captivating, pulse pounding novel with cliff hangers at the end of every chapter. From the beginning I was hooked and never wanted to put it down. Katniss Everdeen is a strong and solid heroine, something fresh and new in the midst of the flimsy and needy girls of many books today. She is calculative, intelligent, and it's nice to see inside her head and her thoughts as her life is turned upside down. She volunteers for her little sister, Prim, in the annual Hunger Games, a gory fight to the death that she must participate in. The cruel entertainment was devised by the Capitol, the ruler of Panem (a desecrated country set into the future in which Katniss lives) and serves as a reminder for the districts to stay in line after their previous rebellion. As the book progresses, Katniss learns to fend for herself and stay strong in the face of adversity and unfamiliarity. This book will always be in my top 10 favorites and I recommend it highly!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so fun I can just sit and play for hours and hours!! I love sushie the best its so cool
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is unbelievably the best book I have read in a very long time. I am not an avid reader and have never been into \\"Romance\\" books but this one takes the cake. The author is incredibly good at what she does. Her descriptions of everything put you right there with the main character Ana. You are dragged in before you even realize it. If you want an excellent read then definitively this is the book for you. But fair warning if you read the first you will definitively want the second and third so go ahead and get all three. I have read them all twice and I am not sure if I am done with them yet or not.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy!! I know I did several times.
1594203334|5.0|I am not sure why this book has been deemed so controversial, I thought it was very informative and interesting. As Americans we tend to believe that our way is always the best way, but I personally really liked learning about the French way of parenting, and am actually very envious of them being able to sleep, eat dinner out, and enjoy parenting more than I sometimes do (I have a 2 year old son and another child on the way). I would recommend to anyone who is pregnant or with a young child!
B0063IH60K|4.0|good easy to use solitaire app. Gives the option of a random draw or a winning draw. The sounds are not obnoxious.
B0015DROBO|1.0|So i thought this book would be great right? Oh how i was wrong. I convenced my boyfriend to get it because i tend to enjoy books that they make into movies more then the accutal movie. Yeah big mistake on that. You have to understand i will read just about anything i can get my hands on. I go though over 300 dollers worth of e-books every 2 months and yet i decided to get this book in paper form... it was so bad that after 2 weeks of trying to get past how boring it was my boyfriend donated it so i wouldent try to struggle though it. Honestly if u are gonna try and read this book do urself a favor and skop the first 4 or 5 chapters. They have nothing to do with the book. I wounder who in the world translated this because it dosent even diserve to be published let alone cost 8 dollers  (14 if u get the paper copy)

But do yourself a favor and go to you tube and watch these 2 rock and when you get the CD you'll thank yourself and wish as i do to be able to catch these guy's somewhere on the road.

B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Yes, this hood is hideously overpriced.  However, it does a fine job of preventing flare without any vignetting at any focal length in the lens's range, it fits perfectly, it reverses for storage, and it doesn't fall off.  What more could I ask for in a lens hood, after all.
B007MJSYF0|5.0|It's taken a couple of days to really assess what I feel about the film which is usually a sign that's there much more going on and it takes some time to digest. Battle Royale is the best version of the \\"making people fight to the death\\" genre I've seen, easily trumping The Running Man and adding significantly more layers of complexity than The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Many people are going to hate this film but it pays to look at the cultural legacy of the country it came from and the relationship between the older and younger generations in Japan. It speaks volumes that the Japanese government expected riots as a result of the film and several countries banned its release. In many ways it delivers the same cocktail of dystopian social commentary and extreme violence as films such as A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />It's very low budget so don't expect flawless effects or production but do expect solid pacing, a gory gusto and one of the finest ensemble performances you'll see from such a young cast. Battle Royale skates into taboo areas and shocks the audience with visceral moral situations but despite the violence and bleak outcome for most of the cast, it's a haunting film that would simply never be made in the USA.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Rarely do I read a book right when the hype around it is still going on.  After seeing this on NetGalley I just had to pick it up and read it.  And I am so thankful I did.  A book that is more than a criminal case, it is about the family that is at the heart of the case.  A small family unit that is solely made up of mother, father and son that takes quite a hit when a classmate at school is found dead in a local park.<br /><br />The reader is taken behind the scenes and out of the courtroom to their  home between the days of the case when it is hard to continue on.  I fell in love with this family and was intrigued by the struggle they faced trying to first determine in their own minds if their son was innocent and then defending him to the end.  The reader is in the middle of the journey trying to decide if they believe that Jacob is innocent or not.<br /><br />Just when you thought the book was coming to close there were four more chapters that took this story to a whole different level.  As I always do, I will not share about the twist ending that takes you completely by surprise and is almost a sucker punch to the gut.  Because of this twist ending, this book is a terrific ride to the very last page.

0439023521|4.0|It was a wonderful book, I read it in two days flat. When I wasn't reading, I was thinking about it.<br /><br />Now, is it just me or are there a lot of sentence fragments in this book? I don't know if it's the style of writing (like in \\"The Things They Carried\\") but it's kind of weird. Some of the science fiction aspect of it is kind of hard for me to visualize, such as the \\"wolves\\" at the end of the book. Maybe it's because I don't really read science fiction, but I don't know.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I heard the reviews for Game of Thrones, yet originally dismissed the miniseries based upon several misconceptions.  True, this is not overtly centered around fantasy elements despite being part of the genre; and yes, there is an abundance of political drama.  However,  HBO and George R.R. Martin have succeeded in creating some of the most riveting characters and suspenseful narration ever witnessed in film.  If you have even a remote interest in dark fantasy, Game of Thrones is the best miniseries ever created.<br /><br />Acting is phenomenal across the board. Recognizable actors/actresses and newcomers alike never miss their mark.  From children to adults, not a single line is delivered without conviction.  The intensity with which you will come to love, or loathe each character is testament to the writing and skillful acting that brings each character to life.  Brace yourself for a rollercoaster of emotions.<br /><br />This is truly an adult series, and if you shy away from extreme violence or blunt sexuality and nudity - you will not enjoy Game of Thrones.  Yet for those who are not put off, I can say that nothing feels forced.  Instead, it feels like a much grittier, natural depiction of the time period and setting.<br /><br />I will not delve into specific episodes, because I honestly enjoyed each of the (10) 50-54 min long episodes equally.  However, there is something to be said about a 10 hour miniseries that is consistent throughout.  In fact, it was difficult to watch less than 3-4 episodes at a time.  Witnessing several stories unravel at once akin to Lord of the Rings was deeply engaging.  George R.R. Martin stated in several interviews he was influenced by J.R.R Tolkien and H.P. Lovecraft, and it shows.  The ghastly White Walkers invoke an almost preternatural fear from their domain behind the Wall, and the characters and backstories are dynamic and unique.<br /><br />Regarding bluray player playback - I also own an Oppo BDP-83, which a few reviewers claim has issues playing the bluray version of Game of Thrones.  I did have to shut off the system and turn it back on several times.  However, once it registered the disc I only had to wait about 15 sec.  Such a minor inconvenience is not even noteworthy considering how revolutionary this series is, and how FANTASTIC it looks and sounds on bluray.  This is nothing new either.  As bluray discs are compressed more, it is inevitable that the players will need additional software updates.  You can't blame HBO for releasing the bluray with better visual and sound quality.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin has said there will be 7 books in the series, and is currently writing the 6th.  I can say, without a doubt, that if HBO continues to live up to its own standards - this will be a collection for the ages.  More than Harry Potter, or any other series - I will look forward to the next installment.<br /><br />Game of Thrones should be placed next to the word EPIC in the dictionary. These four letters can sum up my entire review.<br /><br />HBO, thank you.

Ana bites her lip so much it must be a bloody pulp by the middle of the book, she blushes on every page her inner goddess all the Oh My holy.... crap double crap. This book reads like it was written by a teenage girl. Like many others have said a 21 year old virgin never been kissed she is a college student  and didn't own a phone or computer come on now.She is weak and pathetic  with no back bone. Grey  is a psychotic  controlling stalker he sickend me I found him  creepy and repulsive. Its just mind boggling how women think this book is so hot squee fangirls love it.

B0041T4ML4|1.0|This story is tedious with little draw to pull you in and keep you going.  It is interesting at times and generally inventive and different from other fiction, but difficult to slog through.<br />I liked the concept and wanted to like the story, but it was work to keep going and eventually there was no joy in continuing.  I stopped reading about 3/4 through and simply have no interest in knowing how it ends.  All the favorable reviews are surprising.  Its certainly a novel storyline and concept, but there are many many better books out there.<br />For comparison, its tedious the way Tolkien, Martin, or Asimov can be, but without the draw of the characters and setting to make you want to work for it.

I just kept reading, hoping it would improve, but it kept getting worse. This is atrocious. The writing is bad, the characters are....bizarre, and the use of British terminology was distracting in American characters. Save your money -- try the Kindle sample if you feel you must.

1439192812|4.0|Using simple and clear language (often in a playful way) and creative illustrations, Dawkins' words and McKean's art work contrast the simple and elegant beauty of what science has to say about natural phenomena with the murk and confusion of invoking the supernatural.<br /><br />Adults with a solid science education will not find much new in The Magic of Reality.  I didn't.  But what I can say with complete candor is that had I read this in middle school or high school, it would have chopped a good fifteen years off of the confusion I endured while trying to mesh my religious faith with my hunger for scientific explanations of natural phenomena.  My wife is a middle school teacher, and she covers much of the ground in this book with her sixth graders.  For young men and women who lack, as did I, school teachers as science oriented as my wife, this book offers a whoppingly good shortcut to achieving a science-based world view.<br /><br />As one would expect from a scientist of Dawkin's stature, the information presented is impeccably vetted.  But is it readable? Is it fun?  Brief story that gives a hint of an answer:  Noticing that I had my ADHD nose buried in this book for an uncharacteristically long time, my wife asked to see what I was reading.  When I tilted the book toward her to show it, she was intrigued by the illustrations, and took it from me.  She wouldn't give it back.  I had to choose between marital accord and other reading material.  I picked up my April issue of Scientific American. The next morning, before she was awake, I reclaimed my prize.<br /><br />The Magic of Reality is a serious and solid attempt to show that elegant scientific explanations of the phenomena that we experience every day are more beautiful, and more awe-inspiring, than the legends, myths, and religious explanations that are often substituted for more rational explanations.  Dawkins is a better scientist than he is a writer, and his prose lacks the dazzling punch of the selected articles in [[ASIN:0547350635 The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2011]].  Nevertheless, the finished product is a wonderful accomplishment and a marvelous gift to young minds, or to older minds that retain a strong spark of youthful curiosity and a persistent bent toward inquiry.  Would that I could have read this when I was sixteen, instead of sixty!ed articles in [[ASIN:0547350635 The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2011]].

B002AF4Y96|5.0|I have seen some negative reviews about Natural Born Killers (Unrated Director's Cut) Blu-ray and wanted to share my own experience. I received it on Friday March 30, and I have not noticed any camera shake up and down as some other reviewers have stated.<br /><br />I am very picky about Blu-ray quality and I own probably about hundred titles and I can honestly say that both video and audio quality are excellent. Some parts of the film are grainy but this is intentional. Oliver Stone used different formats, some parts are black and white and some other parts are quite  grainy but this is all to stylize the film. Those parts are not supposed to look crystal clear.<br /><br />My guess is there may be a defected batch of this product or maybe it has something to do with the Blu-ray player or firmware update or something.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|I knew next to nothing about Black Swan before viewing it today and that kept my mind clear and impartial.  It's nothing short of interesting and I think, very well done.  Surprise after surprise greets the viewers and in a short time you realize this is something far more than a story about ballet.  A woman caught in the void, our lead character carries us through a tortured existence in her quest to make it big in the world of classical dance.  I can't say much more without ruining the story, but suffice to say, if you keep an open mind, Black Swan will reward.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|PSYCHO<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock's milestone film Psycho represents a unique turn in the history of the horror film.  It was the first major film not to use a monster or supernatural theme to deliver its shocks, but instead presented us with the carefully detailed mind of a deranged psychotic.  In this way, Psycho is a very different horror film that uses a realistic approach with apparently normal characters and settings to tell a dark story of murder and mental illness.<br /><br />Most folks have seen Psycho, but if you have not, this review will spoil certain elements of the movie.  The plot involves a young woman--Marion Crane--who steals $50,000 from her boss and flees to California.  The flight is tenuous and caught in a terrible rainstorm, Marion stops at the lonely Bates Motel.  Ironically, Marion finds perhaps her first moments of solace at the creepy motel in the company of its operator, Norman Bates.  Norman is a shy, retiring man who is the complete opposite of the men Marion has confronted so far.  His non-threatening manners get her to open up and rethink her decision but fate intervenes and Marion is murdered in one of the most recognizable murder scenes ever--the infamous shower scene!<br /><br />There are lots of things that make Psycho interesting, but I think Norman Bates as played by Anthony Perkins is the main attraction.  The viewer is led till the end to believe that it was Norman's mother who is the killer, which is itself a great notion for a movie, but when we realize Norman is the real killer, the film takes a giant step from common murder-mystery to horror thriller.  Norman's image is transformed with that fact.  He is able to lull Marion into complete confidence, and rightly so.  He's just a weak, harmless man.  He plays the part so well because in his own mind, he is not the killer, and this is what makes him such a dangerous person.  You can spend hours mulling over the Bates character and all the various dimensions that make it up.<br /><br />The shower scene is another start attraction of the film.  Not many murder scenes are so memorable, but this is such an expertly assembled scene.  It's terrifically played out--Marion's vulnerability while nude in the shower, enjoying the refreshing water is balanced by the fact that we suspect she is a fly caught in a spider's web.  When attacked by a shadowy figure in a long dress, we are caught by surprise that an anonymous woman rather than Norman attacks Marion.  The way Hitchcock shoots the penetrating knife blade without showing any direct violence makes the attack all the more vicious.<br /><br />Psycho could have been just another story of murder if it weren't for the thrilling manner Hitchcock created the film.  There is nothing casual or normal about the details of the situation.  There is a great emphasis on facades that create terrible feelings of despair because we know that behind all those seemingly friendly people and images there is really evil and death.  Various images in the film imply this lurking truth as the characters go about their normal, everyday tasks.  It's a common Hitchcock motif--evil hides not in the depths of caves and darkness, but right out in the open with open arms and smiling faces.  This creates a great deal of suspense because once the veil has been lifted, we can genuinely fear for each and every characters safety.<br /><br />Aside from the fantastic story, Psycho is wonderfully filmed.  The settings are fantastic, especially the nearly deserted Bates Motel.  The place is really creepy looking with the large, imposing house up on the hill.  Music is another strong facet, the jarring violin complements the events perfectly is in nearly as terrifying as any of the visuals present.  Added to this is some of the finest camera work and use of angles to create a myriad of moods and points of view to the action as it unfolds.<br /><br />Psycho is a fascinating story of mental illness and murder.  It never gets tiring and is the sort of movie that needs multiple viewings to fully understand each aspect.  There are many things you could talk about with this film, but the simple fact is it's an expertly told story, a believable tale about an unbelievable situation.  It is interesting and creepy and with a great surprise ending, it's engaging and memorable.d is the sort of movie that needs multiple viewings to fully understand each aspect.

0062082353|5.0|I have seen a lot of reviews criticizing the book saying that Chris is an egomaniac or bragging. The man has the record for most kills as a sniper. He was asked to write a book about it, so he did so. Telling the story of how he did that is hard to do without sounding egotistical. He says several times throughout the book, he is no braver than a Marine, no more courageous than an Army soldier, and not even close to the best shot. Other reviews have said that the book is random events with little detail. There is however, a story line, and it isn't really that hard to follow. He goes from BUD/S, to joining an actual team, from there he tells about each of his 4 deployments, in order. It's isn't a tough book to keep up with. Second, he is a Navy SEAL, performing top secret missions during the war. Obviously he can't go into a TON of detail. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the amount of detail he was able to give. This is a very interesting book, a very good read, and it really isn't confusing, despite what these other reviews say.
0439023521|5.0|Unless you live under a rock, you've heard about \\"The Hunger Games\\" and its two sequels. At the time of my writing this review, a little over 5,800 people have also posted on Amazon's site their take on the book. Overwhelmingly, adults and teens rate this baby within the four-and-five star category. It's pretty likely you'll enjoy the story. The movie is also into its second week of release and is justifiably doing gangbusters at the box office. I also just saw the film. It was well acted and keeps pretty close to the book with a few necessary embellishments for clarification and to keep the two-hour film moving along.<br /><br />Ms. Collins' \\"The Hunger Games\\" is written in the first-person narrative. The main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, conveys the right amount of fear, distrust, determination, confusion, anger et al on how a self-sufficent sixteen year old might react to being placed in such a horrible, bloody situation. Because you are witnessing the story through her eyes, you are just as lost and confused as Katniss is about certain events. The author has written a fast-paced, exciting story about survival and how people in power or oppressive governments can not only rationalize doing horrible things to weaker people but be entertained by such doings. This is not too far stretch from our current, need-to-be-entertained, superficial society who love such reality shows as Survivor, Big Brother, or Fear Factor. Look, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a fun read. Its unlikely the book will be given out by a college professor as a reading assignment and that's okay. It's a well-written adventure that certainly left me hanging at the end and wanting to see how the relationships and danger evolves. Enjoy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War by Max Brooks reads like an actual documentary. The tale is told in third person and the writer shares his interviews with survivors. He interviewed hundreds of people from across the globe. The testimonies of these men, woman and children offer a glimpse into the horror that occurred. We learn how military and government agencies all over the world handled this epidemic/war. How powerful governments with ultra cool weaponry found these devices useless against the enemy. He takes us into the lives of civilians and their harrowing account of survival. How ill equipped we really were.  We read soldiers accounts and learn about the aftermath and rebuilding. They share first hand accounts of where the first outbreak began and how individual governments covered these outbreaks up. How greed spread the epidemic. These accounts will have you sleeping with the lights on.<br />World War Z isn't the type of novel you read in one sitting. It is broken up into individual interviews. Some are a few paragraphs and others several pages long. I would read a few testimonies and then set it down to reflect. While the beginning was a little shaky for me (felt dry like a history book) stick with it, because you will not regret it, in fact you will probably re-read this.  It makes you question everything about what would occur if such an epidemic broke out today. Would I be equipped to survive? Would the government consider me expendable? How would I feed my family? How far would I go to protect them? *shivers* Could I sacrifice a 100 people to save 500?<br /><br />Brooks is a powerful writer with a wickedly good imagination, a knowledge of war, and the talent to give each witness a unique voice and personality. The images he brought to life with his pen equally amazed me and horrified me. The testimonies were so believable, the emotions so genuine, that I had to remind myself that it wasn't real...or at least not yet. Parts of this novel can be graphic, but war is never pretty. These zombies aren't cute, and there is no love triangle, but you will see plenty of bone-chilling, zombie stomping, action!an be graphic, but war is never pretty.

B003O86FMW|5.0|We pick up about six months after the last games. Katniss and her family are living in a posh townhouse, near Haymitch and Peeta.  She still goes hunting but only on Sundays and sadly she doesn't see Gale nearly enough.  As a winner of the Hunger Games, she now has obligations to the capitol, and one is to make appearances. Before one such event, she heads home for a make-over from Cianna and the troops, only to find President Coriolanus Snow sitting in the parlor. He gives her a warning about her impact on the districts and makes a threat. Katniss is terrified by it, but will protect her family and Gale at all costs to herself. As she and Peeta tour the districts, the discontent of the people is evident. Despite her intentions to heed Snow's warning she is unable to change things.  After their return to District Twelve, there is a mandatory announcement. This year to celebrate the Quell or the seventy-five anniversary of the Hunger Games the reaping will be different. The tale that unfolds is riveting and the ending left me screaming for more.<br /><br />We see some growth in the characters, and meet new players. Hints are dropped, and key elements are set into place for the final novel Mockingjay. Katniss begins to question things, and looks beyond her family and personal dilemmas to see the bigger picture. The events in the game had me glued to the pages, as one thing after the other happens at a maddening pace. The secondary characters were fascinating and had depth. We begin to see characters both in the capitol and the districts seek an end to the reaping and the suppression of the districts.<br /><br />Collins world-building is amazing, and I loved the glimpses into the districts, the bearing down of the government and the glaring contrast between the districts and the capitol. Whether intentional or not Collins presents food for thought. The similarity between this dystopian and ours, causes the reader to take pause, and think about the wastefulness of the wealthy. Individuals and nations waste without thought as some go hungry or do without.  The capitol represents greed, and its people love everything in excess. The districts are little more than slaves. She reveals the human spirit in all its glory, its will to survive and the power of hope. I love the depth she brings to her characters whether they are exorbitant and flashy or quite and thoughtful. Every character is fleshed out and it makes the tale powerful.ealthy. Individuals and nations waste without thought as some go hungry or do without.

B001EN71CW|2.0|My Blu Ray case arrived broken down the side of case. Where the case be ds is was broken all the way down. You can't open my case without it dropping all of the discs out. I looked into getting a replacement, but I'd only get my money back and have to repurchase the product. It would have been about $10 more. I love the show and am just keeping it with the case broken. I just wish I could have exchanged my product is all.

B00371V918|5.0|Thank you! This book was by no doubt the best of your work that I have read in a very long time. I loved it. The love that John and Savannah shared was written in a way that made me feel as if I was part of it all. I laughed, I smiled, I cried. I felt everything that the characters were feeling, as if I was on the journey with them. Such a touching and beautiful story that I had my nose buried in for two days non stop. Absolutely loved it!
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|I have been a KoRn fan since 1998 (I know I came in late, but you must forgive me I was 7 when their first album came out). What I loved about KoRn, Life is Peachy, Follow the Leader, and Issues is that they were very unique and extremely good it has taken them a long time to get back to something with both traits. The past few haven't been their best, mainly a few singles and ignore the rest type albums.<br /><br />I must say that I hadn't even listened to this all of the way through and I was already in love again. The dubstep artists input gave KoRn back a vibe that has been missing for so long. Some people say that it lacks Jonathan Davis's aggression in the past, I somewhat agree, but also I recognize that when it was scaled back a bit they found a new blend. The new blend feels sooooo AMAZING, Dubstep has an interesting flow that fits the KoRn personality perfectly. The marriage is beautiful and the integration feels so natural, like they belong together. This makes Dubmetal the second genre that KoRn has had a hand in bringing about (as bad as some of the nu-metal bands are it has been overall a good experience) I pray dubmetal takes off, because it has such a good feel.<br /><br />If KoRn does another album that gives goosebumps (this one did) I will bust out my old Follow The Leader 1999 tour shirt and wear it twice a week like I did back in 8th grade :)
B00371V6SE|3.0|The story follows U.S. Marine, Logan Thibault who finds a photograph of a woman buried in the sand during his third tour of Iraq. After failing to find the owner of the photograph, Logan finds himself always carrying it in his pocket. Incidentally Thibault starts to experience a streak of luck that has him winning poker games and surviving combat on various occasions when many others perished, including two of his closest friends. At the end of his five year service as a marine, Logan finds that he is unsure what direction to take next. So he takes on the advice of a friend who encourages him to find the woman in the photograph and thank her, as he owes her his life.<br />Believing that finding this lucky-charm was somehow his destiny, Logan set out to find the mystery woman. After some time researching the photo and its location, he decides to casually walk across the country with his dog Zeus. Once arriving in Hampton, North Carolina - after a very long walk from Colorado - Thibault finds that the woman in the photo. Beth is a sensitive and kind hearted, divorced single mother of a ten year old boy named Ben. She is stunningly beautiful and apparently at age twenty-eight is more gorgeous than ever. Since losing her parents at a young age, she has lived with her strangely omniscient grandmother who speaks in riddles and runs a kennel on their property. A victim of a stroke, Nana can no longer run the kennel as well as she once did and has been looking to hire someone to help her. When they first meet, struck by Beth's incredible beauty, Logan neglects to tell her about the photo and instead takes the job at the kennel.<br /><br />In traditional Sparks style the book follows the couple's journey from strangers, to friends and finally to lovers, whilst throwing a few spanners in the works such as Beth's crazy ex-husband, wild weather and Logan neglecting to mention his slightly creepy obsession with the photo.<br /><br />Although I found the book an enjoyable read, it was hard to get drawn in. Sparks spent the majority of the book developing his characters that seemed so stereotypical and unrealistic that they seemed to be caricatures, as opposed to real people.<br /><br />The 2010 blockbuster 'The Last Song' was the first of Sparks' stories to be written as a screenplay first, novel second. But it's hard not to wonder if after so much success in Hollywood that Sparks is becoming a screenwriter first and novelist second.<br />Overall it seems that this novel could very easily be translated into a movie. Aided by theatrical music, attractive actors, gun shots and North Carolina scenery the first part of the book would make a fantastic cutesy love story. This paired with the melodramatic ending that seemed to be describing various camera shots on a story board, will create the perfect chick flick.<br /><br />In conclusion; I'd recommend reading this book if you're looking for a relaxing and easy read. However if you're more a fan of chick lit than reading a chick flick, I would suggest you think twice before purchasing this book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Take the movie \\"Pretty Woman\\" and make the girl less interesting and the guy twisted and you got \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". I bought this for my kindle because it was a best seller, even though it had some pretty bad reviews, I thought, \\"well sometimes I like books that have bad reviews\\". Big risk that didn't pay off. I was only able to get to 25% before I decided the $9.99 that I paid wasn't worth torturing myself.<br />The story is boring and doesn't make sense. The sex scenes uncomfortable.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book in the Fifty Shades trilogy drew me in and kept me captivated just as well as the first.  James is such a great storyteller; she weaves a tale that sucks you in and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />The story picks up right where the first book left off.  Christian and Ana have been apart for a few days, and both are miserable.  I hated (and loved) watching them struggle so much to be together and stay together.  There are so many layers to their relationship, it was heart wrenching to watch them try to pick through them all.  Where the first book focused on the more playful side of their relationship, Fifty Shades Darker focused more on them getting to know each other and struggling to work out their differences, mainly Christian's overwhelming need to control and Ana's struggle to keep her independence.<br /><br />I love Christian and Ana so much.  They are my new favorite couple.  Their relationship is undoubtably flawed, but maybe that's why it's so irresistible.  In Fifty Shades Darker, Ana struggles to handle her overwhelming feelings for Christian while trying to learn more about his past and why he is the way he is, helping him as he struggles to come to term with emotions and feelings he's always been able to control by simply burying before.<br /><br />There is so much going on between Ana and Christian.  There is so much more than just their steamy, hot sex.  The romance weaved through the story is amazing.  You can see how much Christian loves Ana even through his completely messed up mind.  I loved in this book we got to see so much more of Christian than just his controlling, overbearing self.  We got to see more of his romantic, boyish side, and I absolutely fell in love with him (all over again).  Just like the first book, I loved the witty back and forth batter between Ana and Christian.  Their conversations and emails flow so easily and are fun to read.<br /><br />My only real complaint (as with the first book) was that I did get tired of hearing how not good enough Ana thought she was.  Christian had problems and was understandably messed up, but Ana was just annoying with her repetitive thoughts of self-worthlessness and doubt.<br /><br />These books are very well written.  The whole story flows easily and is easy to read.  There is so much emotion to the story, you feel like you're on a rollercoaster, and the author does a great job bringing that to the pages through the description of the character's facial expressions and body language.tired of hearing how not good enough Ana thought she was.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I had the great privilege of seeing this musical during it's theatrical release; it is absolutely beautiful, everything I could have ever wanted.<br /><br />The story, sets, costumes, peformers were all top notch, and the music is just out of this world!<br /><br />This is the best score Webber has written in years, probably his best since Phantom. The changes that have been made since the London Show have improved the plot immensely, Australia has turned LND into a stunning piece of musical theater and everything just flows so much better.<br /><br />The characters have all grown and evolved, Christine, The Phantom, and Raoul are more human then ever before.  And the chemistry between Ben and Anna just sizzles, they are amazing actors and they bring The Phantom and Christine to life brilliantly.<br /><br />Love Never Dies should not be compared to Phantom of the Opera, it is its own story and deserves to be judged on it's own merits. Leave your bias at the door and you will no doubt be blown away by it, like I was.<br /><br />One of the greatest musicals I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|The app has a nice looking interface. After install it automatically pulled up my local time and a graphic of when daylight of tomorrow morning is set to creep in. There are several customization options for the alarm function, including a calendar feature to set which time zone you will be using on a particular date.<br /><br />The coolest thing about the app is the interactive the map and globe features at the bottom of the display that show which clock you've selected on either a two dimensional map or a three dimensional globe.<br /><br />The widgets are also worth noting. You can display two clocks at once on your shortcut screen in either analog or digital mode. I can see this coming in handy for when I am traveling to remind me to check the time back at home before I call to make sure I'm not waking someone up at 3am (sometimes I forget to do my \\"time zone math\\").<br /><br />This probably won't replace my stock clock app with which I have grown accustomed, but I definitely plan to use the widget next time I travel out of the country.

0143119680|1.0|By chapter 20, I realized that this was the typical romance.  My reading interest normally falls into horror, fantasy, mystery, and some drama.  Throughout the year, I have been tricked by certain authors whose readers, mostly sheltered, claim that their work is considered horror and I, like the fool I am, run for their suggestions with the hopes of discovering a new horror/suspense/fantasy author.  Sadly, I have been fooled by titles such as A Discovery of Witches, Angelology, The Historian and The Passage.  All of these books are about one to two hundred pages too long.  Don't get me wrong, the authors have established themselves well as being able to write and prove they have researched their subjects, however, a reader can only read for so long without any action.<br /><br />Now that I'm done griping about how long and drawn out the above books are I have to state that many authors are seeing where witches, vampires, and werewolves are making a comeback, therefore we have authors such as Mrs. Harkness who are typically romance authors or dramatic authors who ask themselves, \\"Now I want to write romance and typical romance isn't selling, so what can I do to gain attention of a large crowd?\\" Then ureka, \\"I will add a vampire and a witch and call it paranormal romance!\\" Although, I'm sure there is a crowd for this, I'm not the demographic for this crowd.<br /><br />When I read a book like, A Discovery of Witches, it makes me think that a romance novel was the first idea and was likely the first manuscript written.  Somewhere along the way either Mrs. Harkness or her editor or publisher said, \\"It's the typical romance, lets make Matt a vampire and Diana a witch.\\"  And here we have it, a book that excludes action, suspense, and any type of creepy detail... it is nothing more than a romance novel that is using paranormal elements as a crutch.<br /><br />If you have found yourself reading this and you are dying for books that have monsters in them with romantic or dramatic elements read almost any book by Anne Rice or John Ajvide Lindqvist.  If you simply want a romance novel or a book that is for those who are looking for extremely tame entertainment check out A Discovery of Witches, Angelology, The Historian, and The Passage.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am not trying to offend lovers of this book. I understand this title has gained quite a few positive ratings, however, this book has also gained an equal amount of negative and mediocre reviews. Sadly, I regret that I had to be a part of the negatives vs the positives.atic elements read almost any book by Anne Rice or John Ajvide Lindqvist.

B00782O7IY|5.0|With every change in technology and popular tastes, there are those who are left by the wayside when they are unable or unwilling to adapt. And, in contrast, there are those who quickly find themselves better off than they were before. We, of course, know what happens to the latter, but what of the former?<br /><br />  On his way into the theater for the premiere of his latest film, silent movie star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) encounters young aspiring starlet Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) and the two are photographed by the many reporters by the entrance. By the next day, Miller (Bejo) is on the cover of Variety with the headline \\"Who's That Girl?\\" Valentin's spouse, Doris (played by Penelope Ann Miller) is annoyed while Peppy (Bejo) is ecstatic. When she auditions for a role in Valentin's next movie, the studio is hesitant while Valentin is insistent. Over time, Miller's popularity increases to the point where she no longer needs Valentin's patronage. In the same amount of time, Al Zimmer (played by John Goodman), the head of the studio holding Valentin's contract, announces they will be halting production on silent films in favor of sound. Valentin believes sound is a fad and decides to produce his next silent film without the studio. Only to have the opening go unnoticed thanks to Peppy Miller's latest offering being released on the same day.<br /><br />  I haven't seen any of Dujardin's or Bejo's previous films. And, while I recognized members of the supporting cast, their roles were much less significant. Also, given that the majority of the film is silent, it was an unusual experience. I was tempted to switch on my iPod at times, but somehow I didn't think AC/DC was compatible with the tone the film was trying to set. Leaving all that aside, this is a brilliant film and I enjoyed it immensely. Though I would hope it's not the beginning of a trend as silent films could be disastrous in the hands of less competent professionals. See this movie.movie.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I purchased the Hyper 212 as a replacement for that horrendous stock heatsink that comes with the Core i7 2700k processor (sorry intel, but that thing is useless), and I'm already very pleased at my results. My CPU stays around a comfortable 22-28 Celcius and maxes out at around 40-45 Celcius while under a heavy work load (gaming on ultra ftw). Of course, this will never substitute for a well designed liquid cooling solution for all you overclockers, but for regular users and light gamers, this heatsink is a sure bet.<br /><br />On a side note, you'll definitely need to make sure your Memory will fit under the fan and that your case is deep enough to fully seat the heatsink. I'd recommend getting at least a mid tower case. I also use 8GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM, but luckily my Asus P8Z68-V motherboard suggests using channels 2 and 4 for the first two memory sticks. If I wanted to upgrade to 16GB I would have to switch out to a liquid cooling system, but I don't see myself needing more than 8GBs of RAM in the near future.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I finished the series today and to be honest I didn't think I would. I did read the Amazon reviews and the spoiler alerts in the hopes it would get better. Well it did improve and I am glad I completed the books. Books one and three were on Kindle, book two in print; I do wish I had bought the whole Kindle series for re-reading. She is quite an author. These books are written for everyone so sit back and enjoy a great read.<br />My final word is these are the saddest books I have ever read. Saw the movie recently and it was true to the book; glad to see she helped pen that, too.

Tora Tora Tora! actually tries to make sense of the event and look at it from the Japanese point of view as well. How different to the post 9/11 \\"Pearl Harbour\\" where the Japanese are dehumanised and presented as heartless villains. It shows how far back into paranoia, zenophobia and flag - waving America slipped after 9/11. Throw the later version away and buy \\"Tora Tora Tora!\\" if you want a balanced treatment of the most successful surprise attack in military history.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I spent 15 years as a professional recording engineer and recently sold much of my gear including my 24 track recorder and large console. I just wanted a simple interface for my Mac at home. I bought this last week and am quite impressed with the build quality and sound. The unit has very low noise from the preamps, not really any color to speak of (as expected at this price point) but very clean. Definitely better sound quality than the MBox.  It can also handle high end Microphones with the built in Phantom. Some of the interfaces I tested had issues delivering enough current. I used this one with a Neumann TLM-170 for several hours last week without issue.<br /><br />The couple of cons I would list with this are:<br /><br />1. Powered only via USB. This is more of a nuisance issue as my Mac seems to drop power and restore it randomly when I leave the computer idle so I have started turning off my active monitors when stepping away.<br /><br />2. I am not a huge fan of the included Ableton SW and the fact that it limits you to 4 active plug-ins.  This is not really an issue for me since I had always planned to use this with Pro Tools 10, but I think this limitation should be considered for beginners looking at this as a sole solution.<br /><br />Having used the Focusrite high end analog gear for years, overall I am very impressed with what they have done here for less than $150. The plug-ins alone are worth that much so getting a clean interface bundled with the plug-ins is a great bargain.

I purchased this book as a birthday present for my grandson who already loves books and is turning 2.  I think he'll love the idea that what he does seems to  make something happen on the next page.  Can't wait to hear his reaction!  This is really a great book for children-probably age 6 or 7 or younger.
0670023329|5.0|I wrote my Independent Study senior year of college about Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's writings. One of the things I read was his Gulag Archipelago. For some reason, which I really don't want to consider too much (this may have something to do with my love for dystopias too), I have always been fascinated with books about the concentration camps and the gulag system. When I read in the blurbs sent to me by Penguin that the North Korean camps make those pale in comparison, I knew that I had to read this book.<br /><br />The scale of the camps is simply staggering. Shin attended a rudimentary school with approximately 1,000 other children. This is mindboggling, considering that only the children of camp marriages were allowed any form of education within the camp. Marriages were used as a reward for the hardest workers, so just imagine how many people might be in this one camp, of which there were many more. And of all of those people, Shin is still the only person known to have escaped and survived.<br /><br />Perhaps even more startling are all of the other facts about North Korea. It seems as though, horrendous as life can be in the camps, it's not actually that much better on the outside. In some instances, there may be more reliable food in the camps.<br /><br />Harden did a great job with this. He includes a lot of details about North Korea in general, whatever he's managed to learn, that add context to Shin's story. Personally, I knew practically nothing about North Korea beforehand; apparently, there's only so much to know, because the North Koreans really don't want anyone else to know anything. Plus, he emphasizes the limits of our knowledge of North Korea and of Shin. There is often no way to corroborate Shin's tale, because he is the only one known to have escaped from a no-release camp.<br /><br />[Random comment, but I really will never understand why photo inserts in history books/biographys are always put in the middle of a chapter. Hundreds of pages, between any of which the photos could go, but they always put them in the middle of a chapter (actually, usually a sentence), necessitating a back and forth shuffle through the pages. Why not just put them after a chapter and let me flip through the book the way I usually do?]<br /><br />Although Escape from Camp 14 is a brief book, it packs a punch. For those with an interest in history or contemporary politics, this is a must-read.een any of which the photos could go, but they always put them in the middle of a chapter (actually, usually a sentence), necessitating a back and forth shuffle through the pages.

B002KCYIEA|5.0|The movie opens with a successful, classy black couple reaping the rewards of their hard-work...settling in to their new home.  Idris Elba charms the entire film with his calm, cool-natured approach. Soft, natural lighting and crisp clean lines accentuate his character and was a welcome addition to the landscape of the film. Ali Larter, impresses immediately as a smart, sharp-witted business professional.  She has a keen sensibility to the dynamic of men, and initially succeeds with appearing as relatable.  Beyonce is at her best.  She is an attentive and very active mother, yet does not ignore the world outside of playdates.  Her acting is poised and simple.  It is not overdone.  The gay assistant at work is super sweet and funny and the fantastic chemistry between him and Ali was fun to watch.  The film plot does mirror other works, but for me it is refreshingly simple, classic and to the point.  Its a winner!  Watching it now :-)
1451627289|4.0|Alternate history has always intrigued me. A book that starts at a pivotal point of our<br />history, the assassination of JFK was irresistible. I have vivid memories of that day, and the<br />days after. I have never stopped wondering what if?<br /><br />This book did not disappoint. The history is much like I remember. The years just prior to 1963 had a different flavor than the years just after. . . and since. Less bitter, more innocent. Or maybe that's just me? Me being bitter.. without innocence.<br /><br />Stephen King is a storyteller. This is a bit different from his usual fare, but the storytelling is<br />still there. This book has everything.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|For me, anyway, Revolver is the best album ever made.  The Beatles had already turned albums into an art form from the time of \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\"  \\"Rubber Soul\\" had been the most sophisticated Pop/Rock album to its time and \\"Revolver\\" shattered the envelope.  The album in its original form, hidden from American fans for a long time (I bought the British import in the early 80's), was not only a triumph for both John Lennon and Paul McCartney--it was also a triumph for George Harrison.  On most Beatles albums either John or Paul outshines the other.  Lennon has his landmarks  on \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"Help,\\" \\"Rubber Soul,\\" and \\"The Beatles\\" (the White Album).  McCartney outshines Lennon on \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Let It Be.\\" But \\"Revolver\\" was a masterpiece for both.  Lennon's songs include the psychidelically fleshed-out \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" \\"She Said She Said,\\" \\"Dr. Robert,\\" (the infamous song about John and George's first LSD trip).  (\\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" \\"Dr. Robert,\\" and \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" were all left off of the original American edition and instead placed on \\"Yesterday and Today.\\" And they're excellent songs.)<br /><br />McCartney's contributions include \\"Elanor Rigby,\\" the gorgeous \\"Here, There and Everywhere,\\" the brassy \\"Got To Get You Into My Life,\\" and the haunting \\"For No One.\\"<br /><br />But it was also a great album for George Harrison.  He actually wrote 3 songs for this album.  \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" is not a great song.  But \\"Taxman,\\" and \\"Love You To,\\" are great songs.  George had introduced the sitar on \\"Norwegian Wood.\\"  \\"Love You To\\" was his first realized sitar based song.  He used Indian musicians and also inserted an electric gutiar.  It had a distinctly Indian sound and I remember my jaw dropping when I head the opening strum on the sitar. \\"Taxman,\\" of course, is one of George's most famous songs and earned him the first spot on the album.<br /><br />The single from the sessions was also the most advanced thing on AM radio at the time: \\"Rain\\" (featuring the first backward recording on Lennon's fade-out vocal) and the rocking \\"Paperback Writer.\\"  Neither song was a love song, a thing unprecedented. And lest we forget that Revolver was where Ringo debuted \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"<br /><br />The album had orchestration, experimentation and flat out madness, and it showed where things were going for the next 18 months until the White Album brought the Beatles back to a more rock oriented sound.  And it is THE best collection of songwriting from John, Paul AND George.<br /><br />--Will Hemmings
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually didn't realize that there was a book, \\"The Hunger Games\\" for a while. I decided that I wanted to find out if there was a book about this moving that had peaked my interest a month or so before it hit the theaters. To my surprise, there was not only one book, but a trilogy. I read through \\"The Hunger Games\\" in a period of about 30 hours (obviously not 30 hours straight). It was a book that was easy to read, easy to understand and it painted a vibrant picture in my mind as I read it. Suzanne Collins did not waste so much time on the tiniest details, which make some book extremely hard to get through, instead she left a great deal to the reader's imagination. I really like that aspect of these books. I think it is a wonderful book, and trilogy, for today's young adults. I look forward to reading more by this author.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|LOVED book 1, Book 2 was ooooookaaaaay, Book 3 got on my nerves and I was more than ready for it to end. It just started dragging and never really seemed to peak again...ANYWHERE. That bond that you develop with Katniss in book 1...I definitely lost it by the end of book 3. I mean okay...she went through a lot, and its not like I wanted/expected everything to be peaches & cream in the end... IDK...maybe it was just execution...? The Twilight Saga still has my vote on writing style, story telling, execution, and overall character portrayal. Sorry to all the die hard Hunger Game Fames out there :) It was jut okay. 5 stars to Suzanne Collins for the unbelievable success these books have found. 3 stars overall for this reader's perspective. Will I see the movie...? Sure...it's something to do.

B005FITIK0|1.0|I hated this movie. I..hated...this movie. I would rather watch rust...rusting than to watch this movie. As a matter of fact I turned it off after only twenty minutes of watching it. It's a good thing that I only spent a dollar at Red Box. I wouldn't waste my money on this if I was you. Charlize Theron could do better than this. Highly disappointed.

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I really wanted to read Crossed because I had read Matched and just couldn't leave Ky and Cassia's story hanging like that. I have to say that I was a little disappointed with Crossed because I was expecting something as good or better than Matched. I found myself sort of forcing myself to read it so I could just find out what happens and then return it to the library. It was almost like it was dragging on for me. I don't think that it was as interesting or suspenseful as Matched.<br />I did really like that the point of view kept switching between Cassia and Ky though. It was gave more perspective, even though once or twice I got confused because I forgot who's point of view I was reading :P<br />Having said that, I don't think Crossed was a terrible book, but I definitely don't think that it was as good as Matched.

0439023491|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  While not quite as gripping as the first one, it continues the story of the Hunger Games without skipping a beat.  A quick, fast read that provides a good amount of suspense and surprises.  Looking forward to reading the third.<br />Make sure you read the first one [[ASIN:0545425115 The Hunger Games: Movie Tie-in Edition]] prior to reading this one.  Also, don't read it at night since it's very difficult to put down!
0385341008|5.0|I listened to this book recently and was enchanted.  The audio version is well done, with different narrators taking on the different charachters.  The book is written in a series of letters, with the correspondence creating the entire narrative.  It is a fun and unique way to learn about the charachters and the author has done a good job of giving each charachter a different voice.  I was entertained and touched by the people of the Potato Peel Pie Society.  Not too predictable or sappy, but a very pleasant ending all the same.

1250004217|5.0|An excellent book which introduces the reader to a shameful and little-known part of France's history.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Fast and easy reading.  The author writes very well.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't care for was in the early chapters when Sarah kept asking herself questions--why, where are we going, when are we going home, etc?  It was tiresome, and I think the reader could sense the child's confusion without all those questions.

B0009W5JR8|5.0|From the director of Die Another Day and the first XXX comes the sequel XXX State of the Union. The movie had more action than the first one did. Ice Cube played the new XXX who has to stop a threat on the U.S. Government itself. Samuel L. Jackson returns recruiting Ice Cube's character to help him to stop this new threat. There are plenty of surprises and twists in this movie the good guys aren't always good. Things are also not as they seem at first. Lots of explosion, running things down and also the first ever jacking of a tank. If wanting something with action, guns, things blowing up and want to see Samuel L. Jackson, Ice Cube and Scott Freedom then this movie is for you. Being Double crossed comes a lot in this movie it makes it better because you do not know who to trust. Special features  are Filmmakers' Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Visual Effects Commentary Documentary \\"From Convict to Hero: The Making of `XXX: State of the Union'\\", Top Secret Military Warehouse XXX: According to Ice cube and Bullet Train Breakdown.

B003M8NG94|5.0|Never before had we encountered a DVD with a soundtrack-only isolated audio track. And the fact that it's the default setting makes it all the more baffling. But yes, the movie has sound -- English, French, Spanish, Martian, and Soundtrack are the choices. We considered going with Martian, but since it was our first time viewing, thought maybe English would be a good starting point.<br /><br />Good fun!

B006GHA9VQ|1.0|I am a huge fan of the original Phantom.  I remember receiving the original London cast recording (LP) for Christmas before the show opened on Broadway.  I was blown away by it, just listening to it you could picture what was happening on stage. I thought the score was gorgeous with almost every song memorable.  When I bought the Love Never Dies CD I was very disappointed, hard to follow with a very mediocre score.  When I heard the show had been revised for Australia I decided to go see it when it played on movie screens last month.  The staging may be a little different but this show is still a mess.  The best song in the show, Till I Hear You Sing Again, has been moved to the prologue, the idea of the Phantom having a theatre at Coney Island and being known as Mister Y (get it?) just seems silly.  As for Christine and the Phantom having a child together I'm reminded of a line in the original when the Phantom says to Christine \\"that fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood has also denied me the joys of the flesh...\\".  Doesn't that mean he hasn't had sex?  So how can they have a child together.  The changes in the characters (Raoul, Madame Giry, and Meg Giry) just seemed to have been made to move this silly plot along.  Another thing that irritated me about this show is the fact that ALW has used the tune to the title song twice before, on The Heart is Slow to Learn (watch Kiri te Kanawa sing it on You Tube) and Our Kind of Love from The Beautiful Game.  Can't he come up with an original title song?  My advice to you is to ignore this show and go watch the 25 anniversary of the Phantom dvd.  Don't let this show tarnish your memories of the original.
B005RUV0NY|3.0|Ok to watch, but not near as good as season 1.  People don't behave in normal ways.  Why dont they start building fences and safe zones?  The \\"walkers\\" are so stupid that it would be easy to hold up in a safe place and build a community.  Instead, they camp out in the middle of nowhere, walk around and pretty much do nothing.  Also, the budget must have been cut way down, as there are few apocalyptic scenes, not near as many zombie extras, and almost no action,  just a lot of talking.  Lame.  I'll stick with Breaking Bad.

B006T5G73Y|5.0|I first watched this in the theatre. I thought it was fascinating<br />which is why I purchased the blu ray dvd of this movie.<br />The fact that J Edgar Hoover came up with the card catalog system in<br />the Library of Congress was interesting. Before the internet and computers,<br />that saved countless minutes for millions of students searching for a book to<br />research on in the future.  This was used in every library in every State. Everyone<br />should be grateful for that. The movie showed why he was fearful and strict<br />when it came to enforcing the law. Anarchists and communists were thought<br />to be a threat to the country. In the case of the anarchists in the early 1900s,<br />they were a major part of history that has been virtually forgotten. The bombings<br />and threats to those in power can be seen clearly in the movie because of the anarchists.<br />The shooting of the veterans parade and killing of World War I soldiers by anarchists hidden<br />on top of buildings, should be a parable on todays world.<br />Nothing really changes, it just comes and goes, sometimes<br />in circles. The idea of the movie is that he took it too far. A case can be made that<br />he didn't. The Bay of Pigs is overlooked in the movie and the wars in Korea and Southeast Asia.  Not<br />to mention the countless interventions in middle and south america or latin america.<br />Clearly the government and the citizens also took the threats seriously. Yet, the movie<br />doesn't seem to go into this subject and seems to focus solely on the actions of one man,<br />clearly taken out of context in the movie.  I'm not sure if they were trying to make him look bad or what.<br />They could have showed more of his accomplishments in the later years I believe.  J Edgar Hoover had nothing to do with these types<br />of wars or interventions during the 1950s up to the early 1970s. He just secured the country from within, which<br />is what the FBI was suppose to do. So what exactly has<br />changed you may ask. Other than it seems to have gotten more bloated and powerful<br />in regards to the law than it has ever been, with each new threat towards us from any country or any one person.<br />Maybe we can look upon this movie and not<br />conjure up these thoughts but to look at it from the perspective of J Egar Hoover. To understand<br />that he did the right thing during the time he was living. Whatever faults he had and whatever<br />he could not reveal about his personal life at the time is revealed in the movie, but we should<br />keep in mind the good that he brought out.
0385535139|4.0|Early in his career, John Grisham wrote novels that whacked a home run every time.  But even Babe Ruth couldn't do that every time.  This book is workman-like, perhaps a double.  But then, if you can do even this often enough, you're an All Star.  And John Grisham certainly is that.<br /><br />The story is extremely contrived, with sort of caricatures for characters.  It might have been more fun if they were less predictable and more cartoonish, if that's  possible. Attorney David Zinc belongs more in a soap opera than a legal novel.  His two partners, Finley & Figg, are even more unbelievable, other characters even more wooden.<br /><br />But all this criticism doesn't negate the fact that Grisham can still write an entertaining novel, albeit somewhat stilted and predictable.  About the only interesting character in the book is a 90-yer-old Federal judge, presiding over a comical case.  So, despite all this negativism, the novel is recommended with caveats.
0515149489|5.0|This is the best novel I've read in a very long time.  I am an avid reader.  I can't remember the last time a book kept me up that late or made me laugh so much.  Just wonderful!
B0054U53WG|4.0|Good history (thus far) of Google, covering up through the controversy surrounding Google Books. Like Levy's earlier book \\"Hackers,\\" it examines a brainy subculture intent on doing things differently. Of course here it's all for profit, but it would be difficult to deny the brilliance of their search technology, and the amazing data infrastructure they've built to support their service. And savvy use of Firefox plug-ins means you'll never even see the ads. :-)<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the section on Google's entry into and retreat from China, even though I think Google's management was more naive than they should have been. Especially when they had one of their executives spend almost a year examining the opportunity, and he TOLD them not to do it.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed by the epilogue, which described Google's attempts to catch up in the social networking area. Not because of the writing (which is fine), but only because it gives the impression that Facebook is the Google of this decade. Which would be sad if true, because Facebook isn't anywhere close to that level of significance.

B000X107GI|4.0|After looking at various CR-2032 multi-packs in the $3-$5 range, I settled on Maxell's 5-pack. Sure, the packaging isn't designed for retail, but they work really well so far. We bought them for our bathroom scale, then were delighted to discover they work in our car remote fob. Such a great deal! I scored them a \\"4\\" only because I haven't seen yet how well they actually hold up. I'll update my post if they die early.

0439023521|5.0|I adored this book. A fun, clever, intelligent read. For those of you who may have been turned off from the young-adult (YA) genre thanks to Twilight, have no fear. This book couldn't be any more different or better written. Katniss is a true, brave heroine for young girls and older women alike. It took me only a day to read the first book in the series, so guess what I'm reading next? Book 2!
B00004SVIK|5.0|This book and CD set is perfect. I bought it as a gift for a long time fan and it was a hit. If you truly appreciate Pink Floyd, then this is a must. You'll treasure it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I finally broke down and read this because of all of the hype that has been going around the media. I had heard so many conflicting viewpoints on this regarding its storyline, genre, etc. so I felt that I needed to see for myself.<br /><br />I did actually like it and kep tme interested enough to finish the trilogy. As for BDSM, yes its in there, but its minor to what the plot is about (and also the instances of its use is rather limited). You have the same amount (and some times more) steamy sex scenes in a trashy romance novel. Even J.R. Ward in her Black Dagger Brotherhood has touched on BDSM in a few of her characters and it did not get this much hype for its use.<br /><br />The characters are likable and you want to see them become a unit. Although I did not have a personal, emotional connection to either one of the main characters, I could feel a level of empathy as I would for any human being. Especially because the novel isn't about \\"kinky sex\\", but the understanding of  a man and why he is the man he is when Ana meets him.<br /><br />I was frustrated by the fact that we only found out so much about him (just as much as Ana), but I think that was deliberate so that the reader could go on this journey of discovery with Ana. If the author gave it all up in the beginning, what would the point be of reading the rest of the novels in the trilogy?<br /><br />In addition, it is also Ana trying to figure out who she is especially since she is so young. Like most young people who are just out of college, they have no idea who they are or what they want to be. Ana is just exploring this in a relationship that is different than mainstream. It is a story of \\"Beauty\\" taming the \\"Beast\\" - or I hope so by the end of the trilogy. :)

B00009ATIX|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />This thought provoking Sci-Fi film, is not for the person who wants a fast moving shallow story, but for the person who likes a movie deeper than the average water puddle. A film to reflect on. A film that rewards the viewer with enlightenment with each consecutive viewing.<br /><br />If your looking for \\"Star Wars\\" (I love \\"Star Wars\\"), then this is not your space ship, but if your looking for a deep story about the inner workings of a man's mind, & possibly, the beyond, then this is your passport for thought.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this film, for which I had few expectations (I certainly enjoyed Marilyn Monroe in \\"Some Like It Hot\\" and \\"All About Eve\\", but I would never have called myself one of her fans). The photogenic Michelle Williams's seemingly unstudied portrayal of Marilyn certainly measures up to Academy standards, and British A-list actors Kenneth Brannagh, Judy Dench, and Michael Kitchen are top-drawer, as one might expect.  Zoë Wanamaker is terrific as Paula Strasberg, whose sycophantic solution seems to be part of Marilyn's problem; and Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne are very pleasant in their roles.<br /><br />The spectacular English countryside, with the camera's visits to Eton and Windsor Castle, is well worth the price of the DVD. And Alexander Desplat's musical score, realised by Lang Lang's singular artistry at the piano, contributes to the tissue-thin ambience of the film's what-might-have-been scenario. For me, the only sour note is Julia Ormonde's portrayal of Vivien Leigh, whom I remember as being just as vulnerable, troubled, and lovely--even in her 40s--as Monroe was in her 30s. It seems to me that the director could have made a far more interesting film if he had compared and contrasted the two women and what their effect must have been on Olivier's psyche during the months of filming; but that possibility was overlooked in the casting of Ormond, whose characterisation of Olivier's unhappy wife is as hard as nails.<br /><br />I found the most fascinating aspect of \\"Marilyn\\" to be in the recreation of the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl.\\" No, Michelle Williams is not the spit and image of Marilyn Monroe, but, for me she suggests her essence. Nor does Kenneth Brannagh resemble Lawrence Olivier, but his performance and hers certainly create a reasonable facsimile of what might have happened during the confrontation between Olivier, the immovable object, and Monroe, the irresistible force.<br /><br />After all, who could hope to capture the exact reproduction of a cultural icon?ure the exact reproduction of a cultural icon?

B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is nothing sexy about a man who wants to punish you.  There is nothing sexy about a man who stalks you.  There is nothing sexy about a man whose permission you need to drive your car or wear a certain outfit.  And this is why I am so deeply troubled that women are falling in love with Christian Grey.<br /><br />This book takes emotional (and sometimes physical) abuse and idealizes it.  \\"Oh, my controlling megalomaniac boyfriend,\\" is used as an endearment throughout and I simply cannot wrap my head around the fact that women are drawn to him as a character.<br /><br />I was very disturbed but felt the need to read all three so that I could speak knowledgeably about this issue and by the end of the series I wanted to throw up.  I found myself stressed, wanting to cry.  They fight, they make up.  They fight, they make up.  Do you know what emotionally abusive husbands do?  They control, insult and punish....  and then they are quite charming.  That's the point.  That is why it's hard for women to leave.<br /><br />In these books Ana has to ask permission to drive a jet ski, wear certain outfits, go out with friends.  He controls their every move and if she strays, he wants to punish her.  The words \\"You're mine,\\" are used throughout the books as an expression of love.<br /><br />Being owned is not being loved.  Being controlled is not being loved.  I am so saddened that women have fallen in love with Christian Grey.  He's a jerk.  Having your own mental health issues to work out doesn't give you free reign to mentally abuse somebody else.<br /><br />Ugh.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered this dvd because I HATE working out and when I read that it's only \\"20 minutes\\" I thought, hey, I can do that.  It's actually closer to 30ish minutes but it goes really fast.  I completed the 3 levels of the 30 day shred in 34 days (took just a day off here and there but mainly did it every day).  I was worried about my knees at first, but was very careful with my form (listening to Jillian) and had no problems (I am 46 so the last thing I need is to blow a knee!)  With only about 10 lbs to lose, I didn't expect much weight loss (and only lost a total of 3 lbs).  But the toning is outstanding.  I lost more than an inch of my waist and my belly (high waist and low waist), my muffin top is gone and I feel stronger all around.  I feel more toned in the arms and legs too but it's the core that is most noticible to me.  Level 1 isn't too difficult (although you will be sore the first couple of days), level 2 is a killer and level 3 is awesome.  As a person who HATED working out this dvd is perfect and has even inspired me to add more to my daily workout (I moved on to ripped in 30 and banish fat boost metabolism).  Now I look forward to working out...because I'm seeing such amazing results and starting to feel as fit as I was in my 20s.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book is even more insufferable than the first. Ana is a whiny character -  petulant and pathetic. Christian is domineering and insufferable. Their conversations are repetitive and predictable and since there aren't many characters in the book be prepared to relive the same annoying conversations again and again. The characters aren't likeable and  I never cared about them. I actually hoped they would get killed off.  The sex scenes are not hot and become Increasingly silly. They do it at least 3 times a chapter resulting in serious overuse of the descriptive words: delicious, explosion, fullness.<br /><br />Kill me now.
B005OLUOVA|4.0|Ordered this product with trepidation after some poor reviews regarding incorrect contents and poor presentation - happily this purchase was not the case. All CDs and DVDs are present and correct and play beautifully. Prsentation is good, but could have been outstanding with a little more thought. The beautifully conceived photo book comes housed in its own metal sheath, but it could have been improved had it been made to fit snugly inside the outer presentation box. Had this been the case, the book sheath would not have slid around inside the outer box and worn some of the lettering off. It is a minor quibble, but one that could have been easily avoided in the production stage. And yes, the outer box does rust. Being a huge Rammstein fan, purchasing this set was a no-brainer. It is a fabulous set, not quite on par with other Rammstein offerings, but very worthwhile never the less.
B001U7B4T8|1.0|Unbelievable. \\"My back pages\\" is not included? I wonder who was the brainless person that cut this masterpiece and published only pieces of it...
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I never write reviews but I felt like if there were more honest reviews I would not have bought Fifty Shades. I am so sad that I believed the hype. I really would like to get my $9.99 back. I gave it two stars because I finished the darn thing. If you must read it, please wait until there is a price cut on this book.  No plot line. Repeated words over and over and over again. Not the fun, easy read that I was expecting. Take my word for it or not, this book was terrible :-(

006117758X|5.0|Women was my first soiree into Charles Bukowski and the easy reading divine slum prose left me wanting more. I bought Ham on Rye and Post Office in one hit thinking they were chronologically ordered but I was wrong. Ham on Rye is the early life of Henry Chinaski and it was thrilling to discover how our enigmatic hero was shaped into the womanising legend I had read about in Women. What sort of demented upbringing led him to writing, womanising and more importantly alcoholism? As usual Bukowski writes in a style that rolls off the tongue and its a good relaxing read. Post Office was next but I found it dull compared to Ham on rye. Still a pleasure to read but i'm off to read Factotum - apparently the post-adolescent successor to Ham on Rye. 5 bloody stars.

B000S81MHY|5.0|Well designed product.  Functions as advertized; no surprises.<br />Only adjustment required was a slight tightening of one setscrew to take up slack in slide travel.<br />Everything else was solid with almost no slop or play.  Zero backlash.<br />Mounted on drill press to act as milling machine.  Used to cut small copper and aluminum pieces.<br />Worked beautifully.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I purchased this item because I wanted something that would protect my Kindle Fire but at the same time I did not want to carry around something as heavy as a laptop. This is perfect. It covers my Kindle to prevent it from getting scratched from everyday use and it also creates a nice little stand for you to stream your favorite movies or TV shows from Amazon Prime. The stand is a simple design and very easy to set up.It is nice and slim and feels soft and rubbery in your hands. You can easily slip it into a backpack or purse and take it with you everywhere you go and not worry that you may scratch your Kindle Fire. Another nice product from Amazon.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|First, I must say I'd give it SIX Stars if that were possible!  I'd bet most negative comments come from squirts who don't even know who ERB was! This movie covered the first three books of the Barsoom series.  I agree with the name change because \\"John Carter Of Mars\\" is actually the name of the 11th book.<br /><br />I too was afraid that the 100 years old view of Mars would not translate well to our 21st century scientific knowledge.  Not true.....even if the blue \\"9th RAY of Barsoom\\" did cover a lot of new functions, transporting, weaponry etc.<br /><br />Things happened considerably out of sequence when compared to Burroughs' original manuscript, but the plot flowed very well.  I found no boring stretches in the film at all.(film? do they still actually use film?)<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is that the two moons of Mars were always shown in the same relative position to each other.  Everyone KNOWS that Phobos and Diemos travel at very different orbital speeds and are constantly changing position in the Martian (Barsoomian) sky!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app! For what it does, it could very easily be a paid app, IMO. Works great on the Kindle Fire. Great job!
B0072OFOM6|4.0|First, for those that may not have seen Spartacus on Starz and are looking to get into the series via DVD based on its popularity, Spartacus: Vengeance is season 2 of the show but technically the third season. After the excellent 2010 5-star season premier under the title [[ASIN:B003PIUC02 Spartacus: Blood and Sand]], Andy Whitfield who played the lead role of Spartacus tragically died of cancer. Whitfield embodied Spartacus; he was a believable, imposing, rough, tough character that made viewers feel like they were watching the real guy from circa 70 BC. His untimely illness left the studio scrambling to decide how to or if the series would continue. Ultimately the studio decided to produce a prequel that ideally would give Whitfield time to recover after treatment, but sadly Whitfield relapsed and passed shortly after production of the prequel.<br /><br />The prequel was called [[ASIN:B004HW7JMY Gods of the Arena]] and it was excellent. But there was something missing from Gods that made Blood & Sand the 5-Star series that it was: Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character. So for season 2 we get Spartacus back, but was Whitfield really replaceable? Starz took a chance and went for the Whitfield look-alike with Liam McIntyre versus finding another imposing force that could also act. Yes, McIntyre does look quite a bit like Whitfield, but there is something just a little less imposing, less rough and less tough about the guy; he's a kinder, warmer Spartacus that smiled too much (and a bit smaller; he had to look up to most of his warrior co-stars). And that took away some of the believability from season 2 for me....Especially when Spartacus would break into one of his many inspirational and emotional speeches to his group of freedom fighters. It was the non-battle scenes that I was often struck by the notion that 'the real' Spartacus is gone.<br /><br />So was season 2 good? Was it maybe even great? It had some great moments for sure, but had some very big shoes to fill after season 1's finale. Some of the season 2 supporting characters were certainly not as strong as season 1's. The unexpected return of Lucy Lawless definitely helped, but as good as it made the final episode of season 1, I think that the studio was ultimately kicking itself for killing off John Hannah who carried all of Gods of the Arena and co-starred more than he supported many of the Blood and Sand season episodes. (Don't worry: If you're new to the series and you watch the shows in time chronologically with Gods of the Arena first, that tidbit of info about killing off John Hannah is spoiled in the first few moments of episode 1 of Gods even though Hannah stars throughout; so thank the studio for that, not me.)<br /><br />Similar to its series predecessors, Spartacus Vengeance leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period: love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory. The events of Spartacus Vengeance take place after Spartacus' gang of gladiators escape slavery and form a large rebellion to strike down Roman slavery altogether.<br /><br />I was still very entertained by Spartacus: Vengeance. I'm a fan, but Andy in my opinion is sorely missed. I think I'll keep watching, and according to a November 7, 2011, Entertainment Weekly article, a third season has been picked up.<br /><br />Blood and Sand: 5 stars<br />Gods of the Arena: 4 stars<br />Vengeance: 3½ starso fill after season 1's finale.

B007BVOF8E|1.0|What a worthless movie. It starts out with a shooting by an incompetent and goes down hill from there. Maybe if you have read the book this might make sense. I am angry with myself for listening to my neighbor. I thought he was my friend. This movie is about old spies so when you see them walk up stairs it takes quite a bit of time and for some reason there are a lot of scenes where there are old people walking and not adding to the content of the movie. The movie has an elusuision which I can not explain. It make the 2 hour 6 minute movie and makes it seem seem like six hours. The characters are not well defined. I defy anyone to describe what the jobs are with the exception of the guy  looking for the mole. Five people make up the group and they know one is a Russian mole .... solution - replace them all until you figure out who the bad guy is.

B003CR9BYE|5.0|Bringing these two musical icons together is,without question, an International Winner! Yes, I am a huge Frank fan but I have an equally great appreciation for Antonio!This album was produced many years prior to anyones \\"Duet\\" pressings. The blending of New Jersy's favorite son and the King of Brasilian Music established that which we enjoy today. We all knew what a 'mellow fellow' Francis could be but when blended with the smoothness of ACJ it becomes an outstanding musical vintage comparble to the blending of two outstanding wines that are guaranteed to expand your listening pallette.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story line was gripping and once i started i just couldn't put it down.  Author does a nice job describing the many facts of war and the impactions on people and civilization in general.
0385738773|4.0|I have to start out by letting you know I loved the first two books. This one... not so much. I still enjoyed it. It was almost as fast paced as the first two but not quite. I did struggle with picking it up at times. It delves more on the outside world and what is going on in the cities and such. I found that to be interesting. I guess the biggest downfall for me was when it ended I really didn't feel any closure. A big portion of the group got their memories back. That, to me, should have been a good amount of the book. There was something so terrifying about getting them back that they struggled with it. If you got stung by a Griever in the first book the memories made you mad. But after they got their memories back it was... nothing. We also never seem to learn much about Thomas's past. Why was he so gung-ho for WICKED in the beginning? Did he know something important then that he doesn't know now? Most of the explanation for everything that happened since the sun flares seemed to be summed up in the 2 page epilogue. Not enough for me. I personally wanted more. I think this book should have spent more time explaining things than all the action and running from here to there. Other than that it was a good book and look forward to more books by Dashner.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What started out for me as morbid curiousity (based on my co-workers reaction to book 1) I started reading the trilogy.  While Book 1 was definitely shockingly descript, by the end I was hooked on the Characters - Ana and Christian and their love story.  The characters are well written, described so deeply that you understand their innermost secrets.  Book 3 bridged all that was Book 1 and 2 and it ended being a beautiful love story about the fate of 2 people that ultimately needed each other and who helped each other create an unexpected, beautiful life together.  One of the best stories I've read in a long time.... can't wait for the movie!!
0756405890|5.0|I was given this book for a birthday present a very long time ago (i've got a first print with the green man on the front). The cover confused me but i opened it and dove right in. I finished the massive book in less than a week and decided that I am a huge fan. This guy knows how to write a book. The imagery is astounding. When i was trying to convince my friend to read it and he asked what the magic was like i explained it as \\"how magic would be if it really existed\\". The magic is fantastic, but also feels grounded in logic. Again, i'm glad that this book was dropped in my lap because now i can be a part of a very special story.
1612130283|5.0|What a great trilogy.  I am at the end of the 3rd book and don't want it to end.  I am not a big reader, but when I heard of these books, I downloaded them immediately to my iPad and read them in about 3 weeks.  A feat for me.  I loved them so much, I pre-ordered them in hard copy so I can have them when ever I want to go back and re-read, which I know I will do.  A great fantasy...takes you away from real life for a while!!!
0439023491|4.0|My son is 17 and generally plays sports and video games --- I have tried my whole life to encourage him to read for pleasure...but he just doesn't. Imagine my surprise when he couldn't put down The Hunger Games, and wanted to buy the whole set.  It inspired me to read it also.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book very much - it's definitely written for a younger set, and I felt as a Stephen King fan there were an awful lot of similarities to The Running Man, and a few with The Long Walk.  But a good book - I admit I read it from cover to cover and spent my entire Sunday reading...It is a bit predictable, but the characters are good and you do want to root for them.  I will admit that I was a bit surprised at the very end - it did not fit the formula that I anticipated, and I was disappointed that it didn't!<br /><br />A good book, very engaging, and it even got my son to read just for the sake of reading --- that's high praise!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Karen Marie Moning has done it again! I just could not bring myself to put this book down for more than 5 minutes at a time. It was so worth the wait and a shame to see it end!<br />The characters and plots continue to amaze and keep you on your toes up until the very end. So many twists, turns and exciting jumps you get whiplash (but in a pleasant way). I plan to reread again and again. I guarantee you will enjoy Shadowfever!!

B000024Y9L|3.0|I am a huge Maiden fan and the one thing that makes me like Virtual XI a bit less than the others was not Blaze's voice, but the constant chorus repetition on a few of the songs (Like the Angel and the Gambler).  I had steered clear of Blaze for decades, but finally decided to give him a try and to be honest, I like what he did with this group and now feel bad for thinking ill of him for so many years (sorry bro, I was a loyal Di'Anno & Dickenson fan).  I weighed this album primarily against X Factor because that album was Blaze's masterpiece IMHO (so dark and thought provoking...if you do not own X Factor, pick it up!).  That said; Virtual XI is still a good piece of Iron that is much more up-tempo (especially `Futureal' and the iconic `Clansman') and should be included towards every Maiden repertoire.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This is the very insideful book and very well sequences of the situation. After reading this book, you will know your own risk management and careful about stock market. There are some bad guy who are ready to rip you off.
1849903670|5.0|Although the stories are public domain, I adored this publication of the well-known Sherlock Holmes stories. I recently began watching the BBC series, Sherlock, and instantly was captivated by it. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman convincingly and magnificently portrayed Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, and the writing of the show was equally impressive. Once I had finished season 1, which didn't take long as most Sherlockians know, I turned to the original Sherlock Holmes book series, to bide my time waiting for season 2 to air in America. I downloaded this copy of \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" on to my iPad, only because of the cover. The stories are incredible. Captivating and interesting, I could barely put the book down, unfortunately enough for my grades! At the end of the book, I found I had a better appreciation for the work Moffat and Gatiss put into the new series and for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories.<br />Whether you have already seen the series or are simply looking for a good mystery, these stories are well worth the money. And if you are a Sherlockian as I am, this book is well worth the extra dollars if only for the introduction and cover.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show is great, the only problem we had was that watching digitally sometimes has buffering issues. Espisode 3 was like the old Rhapsody players, always stopping the show and buffering. If you like realistically acted shows with high quality research and sets, you will love this show. It's not for the Jersey Shore set, you actually have to have a brain untainted by spray tan to understand some of what is happening, but if you give it a chance,you'll be hooked.
0307474275|3.0|A well-crafted, suspenseful novel with decidedly anti-Catholic and anti-Christian leanings. Nevertheless it is well-written and delivers quite a \\"punch;\\" the author is great at building suspense and keeping the reader turning pages.<br /><br />It is difficult to tell when he goes from quoting true history to making it up, but by the time he gets to Chapter 55 it is pure fantasy. Really aimed at New-Agers, Ulta-Feminists, Wiccan's and the UFO crowd. Lots of conspiracy content. I got kind of tired of the endless symbolism being translated and the \\"this means that\\" and \\"that means this\\" that went on and on. Not for people who want to know more about Jesus who was certainly not the head of a big bureaucracy. The author forgot that Jesus came from a lowly background and his movement was grassroots for centuries.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that there is a kind of \\"Jesus-had-a-wife-and-family\\" sub-genre of story telling. Several people accused Dan Brown of plagiarizing their work. See the book \\"Daughter of God\\" by Lewis Perdue; Perdue accused Brown of plagiarizing his work and the case went all the way to the U. S. Supreme Court. See \\"Word Crime\\" by Ollson for some of the details. Now that is a \\"this means that\\" and \\"that means this\\" read based on some fact.
1468161660|4.0|How does one convey the emotion of a book like Slammed in words?  How does one begin to inspire others to read a book tackling heavy subjects while remaining light and endearing? How does one walk away from a book you know you'll think about long after it's completion?  The answer, simply, is you don't.  My review won't begin to scratch the surface of Hoover's work, so you'll just have to trust me and read if for yourself.  I can't begin to describe all the subjects covered without giving away too much of the story, so I won't.  And the message of this read along with its characters will remain in my heart for a lifetime, so I refuse to say goodbye to them.<br /><br />Having enjoyed slam poetry when I've had opportunities to see it performed, I jumped at the chance to read a book including such subject matter.  Little did I know this gem of a freebie (at the time I \\"purchased\\") would take me on a whirlwind of emotions from flirt to romance, anger to grief, desire to inspiration... There are true characters facing real life with all it's unrehearsed moments and unprepared for disasters while embracing the highs of joy alongside the rawness of pain and a romance which will leave you aching.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from a five start rating, for me, were parts that seemed rushed (characters connecting at deep levels in a very short time span) and places where I think it could have been expanded (mother/daughter relationship).  The beautiful \\"slams\\" worked into the read, though, more than make up for the few parts I wanted to be deeper and longer.  Hoover is certainly talented in her creation of characters (primary and secondary), plot (including unexpected veers), emotion (which seeped from the pages into my soul), and - of course - her poetry.  I look forward to experiencing more works by this author.

B00377V6J2|5.0|\\"In session...\\" is really two masters jamming away in an informal session and creating blues magic. Outstanding performance, and pretty good recording to boot. I have a few hundred CDs, but only about a tenth of them sound good on my audiophile system; this is one of them. I never tire of this CD. The DVD content is very good, too. And I can't conclude my review without commenting on what an incredible value this CD+DVD combo is. A must-have for any blues fan!
B007C3TVNA|4.0|Going into \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" (110 min.), I knew very generally what the theme of the movie was (Kevin is a troubled kid and he is going to do something horrible) but purposefully I did not know any of the plot details as I wanted to movie to surprise me. Boy, did the movie surprise me!<br /><br />The first 20-25 min. of the movie are absolutely transfixing, as there is hardly any conversation, and there are miltiple story lines going on at the same time. The picture that eventually emerges is one where Eva (Kevin's mom) is dealing with the traumas of whatever Kevin has done (we don't know until much later in the movie what that is), and also, in flashbacks, reflecting on how Kevin grew up (and why he turned out the way he did, and of course where there was anything she could've done better or differently). The acting in the movie is mostly outstanding, with Tilda Swinton as Eva, but the 3 actors who portray Kevin are equally effective, none more so in my opition than Jasper Newell as six to eight year old Kevin.<br /><br />This is a chilly and devastating movie, but oh-so-good. I was literally frozen into my chair as I watched this movie unfold. Given the general premise of the movie, and the fact that there really isn't a single uplifting moment in it, it is amazing that this movie even got made at all (and not so amazing that a good part of the funding came from BBC Films, apparently). Also a special mention that the music score was done by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. In all, if you like off-center movies that are not your typical Hollywood main fare with happy ending, by all means, check this movie out. \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ok so you people complaining about the update reviews are for people looking to get the game not look at complainers it is a great game with tons of levels put an ad free paid version and I would easily buy it
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A DA is called to a murder scene of a 14 yearold classmate of the DA's son. In the course of the investigation, the DA's son becomes the prime suspect. This is an engaging mystery which also actually rather successfully delves into family relationships and to a lesser sense the \\"science\\" of genetics. For the most part it is well written and engaging. The ending is totally unexpected. I would recommend this book rather highly.
B0077ATSU4|2.0|In \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,\\" 9-year-old Oskar (Thomas Horn) faces life without his father, Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks), who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, a time Oskar refers to as \\"The Worst Day.\\"  Oskar happens upon an envelope among his father's possessions.  The envelope is labeled \\"Black\\" and inside is a key.  Oskar enjoyed the treasure hunt and riddle games his dad was always inventing for them, and figures this key might be one last game his dad left for him.  Surmising that Black is someone's name, Oskar determines to visit everyone in New York City with that name to find out what the key opens.<br /><br />A socially awkward kid who was tested for Asperger's syndrome, Oskar devises a methodical plan to visit each and every Black on his list, borough by borough, neighborhood by neighborhood.  Because he has psychological issues with the subway and buses, he sets out on foot to pursue his quest on foot during the weekends, carrying a tambourine to calm his nerves, as his mother (Sandra Bullock), caught up in her own grief, passively watches. Oskar is assisted in his journey by an elderly man (Max von Sydow), a mute who rents a room in his grandmother's (Zoe Caldwell) apartment.<br /><br />Tom Hanks appears briefly at the beginning of the film and intermittently later on in flashback to illustrate the strong bond between father and son.  The elder Schell was fond of creating mind problems and engaging Oskar to figure them out.  They would involve putting clues together and allowing Oskar to unravel them with minimal assistance.  With his father gone, a huge void is left in Oskar's life and he creates a kind of secret shrine to his dad, which includes the answering machine containing the last words spoken by his father on The Worst Day -- recordings even his mother hasn't heard.<br /><br />Young Mr. Horn is clearly the focus of the movie.  His Oskar is bright, determined, unconcerned with his own limitations, and consumed with hisquest.  Because his Oskar is somewhat off -- not the typical kid you'll find next door -- it's tough to identify with him.  We feel for his loss on a non-emotional level because it's what anyone would feel about a kid who's lost his dad.  This is not to disparage Mr. Horn, who delivers what is asked of him.  But because his Oskar skews from the norm, he has some resistance to overcome to get the audience engaged.<br /><br />Mr. Horn is not terrific at eliciting instant empathy.  Because he doesn't approach his grief in traditional fashion -- crying, moodiness, withdrawal -- he is an oddity.  This creates an emotional distance between character and viewer.  We are interested up to a point, but then start wondering.  Shouldn't this kid be in therapy?  Is it safe for a young boy to be traveling the boroughs alone?  Isn't it the responsibility of an adult in his life to explain the folly of his goal and keep him safe?<br /><br />Director Stephen Daldry and writer Eric Roth have put together an excessively sentimental tale about loss, healing, and acceptance with little attempt at subtlety or restraint.  Under Daldry's direction, Mr. Horn must carry the picture, and though he gives it a Herculean try, he can't salvage a flawed script.<br /><br />There are several additional problems.  First, many of the characters remain sketchy.  Oskar's mom, his grandmother, a certain Mr. and Mrs. Black (Jeffrey Wright, Viola Davis) and especially the elderly renter are curiously underdeveloped.  Because the relationship Oskar forms with the elderly man is the boy's first real bond with another human being since the death of his father, it approaches poignancy, but Daldry simply uses the character as an interesting footnote rather than as someone who has a lasting effect on the youngster and his search for the impossible.<br /><br />Jonathan Safran Foer, the author of the novel on which the film is based, incorporated information about the effect of the Allied bombings of the German city of Dresden on the Schell family and contained ruminations on terrorism, war, and personal lives thrown into chaos by politics.  These are absent from the movie, leaving it more about communal healing than about national trauma but not making us feel an emotional investment in its characters.<br /><br />Sentiment is fine in a Lassie movie or in measured doses in mainstream films.  What feels wrong in \\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\" is its obvious manipulation.  Director Daldry uses a child in an emotional tailspin in a blatant attempt to win our hearts but keeps us at arm's length, never quite succeeding in embracing us.  We start as spectators and remain so.<br /><br />The film has a rambling nature until the elderly renter joins Oskar in his trek around the city.  There is great chemistry between the two, and von Sydow's exceptional performance elevates the movie considerably.<br /><br />Rated PG-13, \\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\" plays as a mystery predicated upon a young boy's desperation to solve his father's unintended final riddle.  As a picture about grief, it shows that the loss of a loved one takes different tolls on different people and each bereaved person must get over it in his own way.  Actual images of the 9/11 tragedy are fleeting, fortunately, and serve mostly to express the horror of the day. Ultimately, the movie never fully involves the viewer.  The fine performances far surpass the caliber of the script.

B0050PYNN0|5.0|Even though this has got to.be one of the worst movies ever made in most People's opinions, my husband and I love it! We find the humour very funny and the effects to be excellent. If you like bad language and sick jokes, this is for you.
0439023513|1.0|Just so you know, THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.<br /><br />The fatal flaw is the main character. I have heard her described as strong and resourceful, but really I see little more than a girl with a pretty face who knows how to hunt. Here's why:<br /><br />1. She is mainly a reactive character. There are few choices she makes on her own. Most of the time, she only acts because she has no choice. She doesn't take initiative. For example, in Catching Fire, she decides she wants to start an uprising. She tells one person about this and he thinks it's not possible. So she never does anything about it. She never tries to convince anyone in District 12, she doesn't make plans for how it would work. She just talks about how they should have an uprising. So now in Mockingjay, when she is thrust into the middle of the rebels what does she do? Does she train and prepare and give ideas for how to proceed and fight? Nope. She hides in broom closets and mopes. Only when she is denied the ability to go into battle does she train and prepare to fight.<br /><br />2. She is manipulated by everyone. From the time she goes to the Games in book one, people take advantage of her and use her and she just allows it to happen. She is fine being everyone's mascot without knowing any details. I can understand why she tried to appease Snow in Catching Fire on the victory tour, the lives of her loved ones were at stake, but what about Coin? It is obvious that District 13 is just as controlling as the Capitol. Yet she just accepts that they must be good because they aren't outwardly violent. So she is fine doing propaganda for them without knowing exactly what she is going to be telling everyone with her actions.<br /><br />Ultimately, the main character of this book made me furious. I am a woman. I want a female main character who is brave and strong and intelligent. Instead we get characters like Katniss, who are resourceful and capable, but lack conviction. We are told by Peeta several times thatthere is something about her that makes people want to protect her. How are we supposed to see her as strong? A strong female is one we want to protect? That makes no sense. If he had said there's something about her that makes people want to be better or stronger or there's something about her that makes people rely on her, that would be a strong female. What are we teaching young adult women when we idolize women who should be taken care of?<br /><br />In reality, the reason why people think she is a strong character is because she is a girl. If Katniss had been a male and acted the same way, people wouldn't call him strong, he would be mediocre. I don't want a female main character who is \\"strong for being a girl,\\" I want a female main character who is strong. Period.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|I love the movie, I' am a huge fan of the entire series so a little biased in that sense.  The DVD is a bit dark is some scenes, looks a lot better in blue ray.  one thing I hated was the UltraViolet Digital copy, I didn't realize it was not a digital copy I could download to my Ipad.  You're forced to watch it on your computer or Kindle, and the video is not permanent, it actually expires.  Totally lame

0307592731|4.0|WILD is a new memoir by Cheryl Strayed that recounts the months the author spent hiking alone on the Pacific Coast Trail (PCT), from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon, all the way to Washington State, following her divorce and the death of her mother.<br /><br />I was incredibly excited to read this book after reading an excerpt in the March issue of Vogue the the subsequent news that Reese Witherspoon had optioned the film rights for the book. I couldn't even wait for my 2-day delivery for this one - I picked it up at the bookstore the day it came out.<br /><br />The stories from the trail are absolutely riveting, beginning with Strayed making rookie mistakes like not trying on her pack until the day she sets out on her journey and including encounters with bears, dangerous men, and unpredictable weather. I have never been on a hike and the idea of me camping would send anyone who knows me into fits of uncontrollable giggles, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading about everything Strayed encountered on the PCT -- from mishaps like losing a boot and needing to create booties out of duct tape to the overwhelming kindness of strangers along the way.<br /><br />The author chooses to interweave stories from her past along with her account of her time on the PCT, and I definitely enjoyed the tale of the trail more than the stories from her younger years, which include bad relationships, heroin use, casual sex, and more. That said, it was an undeniably effective tool for helping the reader understand why a 26-year-old woman would choose to hike solo through 1,100 miles of wilderness for several months, and her transformation following her time on the PCT has that much more of an impact.<br /><br />Truthfully, it has taken me some time to review this book because I was somewhat torn about my feelings about it. Strayed doesn't shy away from portraying herself negatively or acknowledging her shortcomings, and it's clear that she was damaged, bruised, and broken longbefore she took her first step on the trail in her too-tight hiking books. Some of the stories are difficult to read, and the author's brutal honesty is shocking in a way that makes me wonder if it's only there to shock me. I was also expecting a \\"woman vs wild\\" story about the experience of an inexperienced hiker, traveling more than 1,000 miles alone through the woods, and was surprised to see that the tone is more along the lines of \\"woman vs self,\\" touching on themes of grief, loss, abandonment, and reinvention in the life of a self-destructive young woman.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, I enjoyed the book and would absolutely recommend it. It's very well-written, and the author's voice is lively, entertaining, and engaging.
B0041SGYVQ|5.0|Being an avid Jane Austen fan, I have watched every single adaptation of Emma (as well as Austen's other works). The older 1972 BBC adaptation, Emma (BBC, 1972) was quite tepid and the lead actress was not very inspiring in her role, lacking the upbeat, and sunny disposition that one associates with Austen's character. Then there was the A&E version starring Kate Beckinsale in the title role, in Emma (A&E, 1997) which though much better than the 1972 version (which also suffered from inferior production qualities), was still not the best adaptation. Finally, there was the movie version of \\"Emma\\" starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and until this current adaptation, this was actually my personal favorite (even though I personally found Paltrow's accent rather stilted)- it was a gorgeous movie with beautiful cinematography and the chemistry between Emma (Paltrow) and Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) was simply wonderful and altogether credible.<br /><br />This is truly a stellar production in terms of casting, and production qualities. The title role of Emma is credibly portrayed by Romola Garai, who has also been in other notable productions such as I Capture the Castle,and Daniel Deronda. She is perfectly cast - luminously beautiful, snooty, a busybody matchmaker wannabe who feels self-justified in her quest to pair off couples regardless of their own wishes, and yet possessing of a warm and sunny disposition. Romola Garai convincingly portrays all of Emma's characteristics - both her lovable and annoying qualities, her immaturity and impetuousness, and also shows her ability to transform from a self-centered immature young girl into a mature woman who realizes her flaws.<br /><br />The other lead is of course Mr. Knightley, and he is also convincingly portrayed by Johnny Lee Miller, who had portrayed Edmund Bertram in the 1999 movie adaptation of \\"Mansfield Park\\"Mansfield Park (1999) which was rather reviled by critics and purists alike for its liberal adaptation of Austen's classic. Miller was also excellent as Lord Byron in Byron.I was quite concerned initially because I had always thought Jeremy Northam's portrayal of Knightley to be the best thus far, but Miller comes close, and in fact brings a new interpretation to the character that I really appreciated. There is this one scene in the series where Emma invites Knightley to dance, and as they dance...viewers get the sense that these are two individuals who are gradually realizing their real chemistry, not just as childhood friends and relatives-in-law, but as true soulmates. It is definitely one of the most romantic parts of the series and a highlight!<br /><br />The other characters are also generally well-cast - Mr. Woodhouse is played to delightful effect by Michael Gambon (aka Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movie franchise); Harriet Smith is portrayed by Louise Dylan (though I still prefer Toni Collette's portrayal of Harriet in the movie version); the talented Jodhi May plays Emma's governess turned Mrs Weston (Jodhi May is a veteran of BBC productions and Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, The Other Boleyn Girl (2003 BBC Version), as well as others, including the coincidence that she was also in Daniel Deronda cast as the Jewess Mirah Lapidoth who attracts the attentions of Daniel Deronda, showcase her diverse acting talent); Frank Churchill is portrayed by Rupert Evans and I must say this particular adaptation portrays Frank Churchill in a thoroughly unflattering light - the man is simply infuriating, and gives Mr. Elton a run for his money! Mr. Elton is played by Blake Ritson who recently portrayed Edmund Bertram in Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, capturing the beauty of the lush English countryside through the seasons, and the score is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!). The costumes are gorgeous - simple in their beauty, yet detailed and period-accurate, and the other production qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).<br /><br />Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of \\"Emma\\" thus far!duction qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).<br /><br />Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of \\"Emma\\" thus far!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great AP. I like that I don't have to wake up to a really irritating buzzer or ringing alarm, there are several more subtle options. Additional features, like making you do simple math problems before you can hit snooze, is a evil but great way to get you to wake up faster.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|I was mostly interested to see this movie for 2 things:  1) Gary Oldman's nominated role and 2)the always amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. I hadn't read the book or seen the Alec Guinness version or anything.  All I knew it was going to be a slow, measured British spy drama and not to expect it to be all Bond-esque.  I personally enjoy a good plotty drama as much as anything with car chases and explosions, so I figured I'd enjoy it.  Unfortunately I come away from this movie with a resounding Meh.  It took me 3 different settings to finally get thru the whole thing because I kept wondering when something, ANYTHING interesting was going to happen.<br /><br />Overall it brought to mind the Eddie Izzard bit from Dressed to Kill about British film:  \\"But we've got known in Britain for making the smaller films, you know.... they're kind of \\"a room with a view with a staircase and a pond\\"-type movies. Films with very fine acting, but the drama is rather sort of subsued and - subsumed or - a word like that. Sub- something or another. You know, just folded in and everything's people opening doors.<br /><br />\\"Oh, I'm - oh, what? Well, I've - oh.\\"<br /><br />\\"What is it, Sebastian? I'm arranging matches.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, I - I thought you - ... I'd better go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, I think you'd better had.\\" ( sings morose melody )<br /><br />And you can't eat popcorn to that! You're going ( mimes trying to eat popcorn but getting frustrated and sighs.)\\"<br /><br />This movie fits that description nearly to a T.  Fine acting but boring drama.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|I had the vinyl of this when it first came out. I don't remember it sounding this good. I had a cheap record player (all I could afford) but I knew it was special. Especially considering where these fellows came from, and how young they were. I didn't like Stewart's version of the blues at first but it grew on me. I had a lot of Ray Charles, Muddy Waters and other American blues masters and this seemed so alien at first. Zep hit not too long after this and all of it took off with the public in a big way. You know the story. This is on fire, well played and still sounds terrific. Every song is good. Stewart always liked to add a folk tune or two to all of his early albums. The apocalyptic \\"Morning Dew\\" is the Standout folk tune here. Beck does a great \\"Greensleeves\\" also.<br /><br />Beck and Stewart were a great team.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I like this app alot.  You can pick and choose your ab workout or randomize it, it even has the length of time to workout
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Apparently, this story was originally a Twilight fanfiction. Well, it certainly reads like fanfiction. The writing is awful. Clearly, the author has had no formal writing experience. If I had to read the phrase \\"Oh my\\" one more time. I could only get through 1/3rd of the book before I realized I couldn't finish it. The English Lit major in me could not stomach it anymore.<br /><br />On top of the low quality writing and characterization, I felt a real depression come over me while reading this book. I have no other way of describing it but depressing. I guess it's not called 50 Shades of Grey for nothing. The book is grey and melancholy. Are we really supposed to want to be Ana? Really? Because to me, it was an abusive relationship that she had no control over. I guess a guy can do anything he wants if he's good looking enough. He must be trustworthy if he's hot. That's the kind of thinking that lead Ted Bundy to kill all those women. Frankly, it's sad that this book has become so popular. Must be alot of masochistic women out there. Sorry, I'm not one of them.

Catching Fire is the best book in the series, so dont delay buying it!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm a senior and had not intended to read these books, but my oldest daughter suggested I might like them. Loved them!! I could not put the books down and when I finished, I wanted more. Well written and I hope she writes more on this same level! This was another Kindle purchase for me...
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|I can't believe others didn't like this movie! I thought it really kicked ass! MMA Pro Gina Carano is the next action star. She was phenomenal! Her acting will undoubtedly improve with practice and although it wasn't Oscar worthy this time; this being her first major role she still managed to captivate. She was cold and ruthless and was absolutely believable in the role and vital to the scenes. Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, and Channing Tatum had great supporting roles. This really reminded me of the bourne movies im certain ways. I highly recommend watching for some great action scenes. Move over Jason Bourne. Mallory Kane has arrived.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I loved this movie. It may be not as magnificent as other Spielberg and Kubrick works, but it is still a great moment of cinema. I watched it with a great emotion and I was afraid for the little hero (or rather two little heroes - let's not forget Teddy...) from the beginning to the end. It made me cry twice, no matter how much I tried not to. It really reached deep into my heart as no other movie managed to do in years... So, there is no other possibility - five stars.<br /><br />I agree however that AI is clearly a patchwork of ideas rather than one project. It is because this story was worked in all successively by four very talented but very different men. It began as a short story (&#34;Supertoys last all summer&#34;) by Brian Aldiss, a great name of British SF, known mostly for his magnificent &#34;Hothouse&#34; novel. As most of SF writers from 60s and 70s Aldiss was very pesimistic and his writings are usually rather sad and gloomy. His mark is clearly visible in the movie.<br /><br />The short story was rewritten in a scenario by another great name of SF, Ian Watson, who of course left his own personal inprint. The person who had the idea of making a movie about a modern SF version of &#34;Pinocchio&#34; was the great Stanley Kubrick. He never realised it however and when he died, according to his last will, the project went to Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Spielberg inherited a very sad, depressing and dark tale of suffering and despair and he simply couldn't realise it like it was. He changed the story, mainly removing the &#34;horrible bad ending&#34; and replaced it with a kinder &#34;not so happy end&#34; which so many reviewers didn't like. Well, me for one I think he was right because ending AI differently would give a movie that only a really bad person (and by saying this I really mean &#34;a sadistic sociopath&#34;) could like...<br /><br />You probably already know what this story is about - a robot child, who was programmed to love his foster parents and who wants just to be their child, nothing else... but even that little will prove to be too much to ask... No other spoilers. Haley Joel Osment gives here a performance as brilliant as the one he gave in &#34;Sixth sense&#34;. Jude Law and William Hurt are good in second roles. A great &#34;star&#34; of this movie is Teddy, a little teddy-bear robot, once a very expensive and cool toy, now obsolescent and falling in pieces... The scenes in which he is fixing himself with a needle and some yarn will probably touch the coldest hearts.<br /><br />This is NOT a movie for children! I strongly warn you against watching it with them, unless they are at least 12. Some of the scenes are very disturbing (like the execution of &#34;strays&#34;, robots which were abandoned or chased away by the owners) and even after the little Spielberg touch, this movie is still terribly sad....<br /><br />All in all, I believe you should watch this movie, at least once - you will not regret it. And you can also use &#34;A.I.&#34; as a medical test - if the final scene doesn't have any effect on you, you should see a doctor...ents and who wants just to be their child, nothing else... but even that little will prove to be too much to ask...

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I liked this film a lot, mostly because it is SO DIFFERENT from most of the Hollywood recent offerings in adventure/survival category. This difference must however remain a surprise, therefore I simply can not elaborate, to avoid the spoilers.<br /><br />The one thing probably everybody already knows is that this is a film about a group of people stranded in northern Alaska in the middle of nowhere, during a winter harsh even by local standards. The way they arrive to the place of departure of their ordeal is VERY well described! The group counts initially eight members - but without providing any real spoilers, I can say that of course not all will make it until the final credits. Another thing I can reveal is that guessing the exact identity of all those who will survive is not an easy task - I for one completely failed...<br /><br />Another thing probably known to anybody interested in this film, is that some wolves are involved. Here, the only thing that I can say, is that this film avoids both typical \\"wolf movie\\" wolf traps. First, there is absolutely NO fantastic elements - the wolves are simply a bunch of very pragmatic and down to earth (or rather snow) hungry fellows, who just happen to be well skilled in their trade... Second, there is no New Age/ecologist wolf worshipping - wolves are animals with all the wonderful and nasty things that it implies. And wolves will be wolves. Period.<br /><br />Alaskan winter wilderness is shown in an incredible way, in its full majestic, cruel and merciless beauty. Visually, this film is breathtaking and for that reason I advise to buy it in Blu-Ray rather than in classical DVD, as here every pixel counts.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is GREAT! There is simply no other way to describe his performance. His character is very believable and I found it really likeable. Without revealing too much I can also say that I felt for him a lot, as he is a man in lots of pain, from the beginning of film, as it is shown in the two first minutes - and nothing more will be said...<br /><br />Other characters are also rather well developped and actors play them well. Most of actors were completely unknown to me, with the exception of Dermot Mulroney, who clearly went a long way since his beginnings in romantic comedies in the 90s...<br /><br />You should not expect any \\"Rambo\\" or other \\"Great White Hunter\\" moments. The film is very realistic and all the \\"heroes\\" are just ordinary people, who found themselves in a very extraordinary situation. They begin their trek for survival already under big shock and are most of the time very tired, very cold and very very scared - and that means that they make mistakes, which people comfortably sitting in a warm cinema and having all the time of reflexion they want, would probably avoid... I found this vulnerability of all the characters, including the one who is in principle the most skilled in survival, a very realistic touch.<br /><br />But the thing that is the most impressive is the study of the approach of those people to their very possible future death. In the immediate proximity of death people start to see the world differently and understand things which remained for them a mystery previously. Now, there is no preaching in this film - here, there is no better or worse way to deal with the sound of approaching steps of the Grim (or here rather Grey) Reaper. But there are many different ways. And as far as I am concerned, that was for me the main point of \\"The Grey\\" - how scared, exhausted and suffering people face the high probability of a horrible death, when in the same time struggling with all their forces to live another day.<br /><br />Bottom line, I found this film a very excellent thing, I spend a very good cinema moment and I am going to buy the Blu-Ray as soon as it is available.utes - and nothing more will be said...<br /><br />Other characters are also rather well developped and actors play them well.

B003DZX44I|5.0|This movie is just as fantastic now as it was 20 years ago when it was first released! This new release has a few extra scenes if you watch the extended edition which add a new flare to the original film...but the original one is still wonderful. Seeing it on Blu-ray brings back the magic from your childhood when you saw it for the first time and dreamed of being Belle or the Beast that she falls in love with. You won't be disappointed.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|I just watched this movie last night, and I really enjoyed it. I really wasn't sure what to expect, but I was hoping for something along the lines of [[ASIN:B002BI6SMI Taken]]. While this movie wasn't much like that one, it was on par with that movie in terms of quality and intrigue. This movie isn't an all-out action movie, but there are a few action-packed scenes when it makes sense to have them. What I liked best about the movie was that it wasn't predictable. The story moves along at a good pace, and as Liam's character tries to unravel the mystery of who he really is, you are right there with him, picking up the clues and revelations at the same time. The older I get, the less I like predictable movies, and this one WASN'T PREDICTABLE. It was just a good movie mystery, and favorable to watch with teenagers. A bit of swearing, a few non-graphic shower scenes, and a few explosions and gun-shots are what earns it the PG-13 rating. Overall, I was pretty pleased with this movie.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|If you enjoyed season 1 of Sherlock, you will be blown away by season 2! Superb cinematography, acting, and writing. The storytelling in the final episode was especially amazing. I immediately wanted to watch it again and pick up on little details previously missed. Each episode is like an excellent movie. Can't wait to finally own the DVD, and for season 3 to be released!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games had by far surpassed all expectations I had for the book. I was really expecting it to be a bit dry as it is intended for teen readers. I could not have been more wrong. It is the first book in a long time that I could not put down. I wanted to keep turning the pages and see what happened next to some of my favorite characters in a book since I read Wizard's First Rule.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. very easily accessed. my little boy loves to play these games. very kid friendly. able to be enjoyed
B004Q7CIFI|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I guess I have read to many GOOD books lately.  There were a few pages and events of interest, but the book was way to long for the outcome to have made this a good read.  I also think I really over paid for it and I am glad I did not purchase the hard cover version.  Sorry Stehpen, this was not your best work.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|It's really hard to beat this processor for its price! I mean really something that can go all the way to 4Ghz with stock cooling in a matter of a few BIOS changes and for $320 worth it. Don't save a little money by going with the 2600.\<br /><br />Fast gaming Fast editing Fast chip No complaints!!
B004ZJZQH4|4.0|Alright, this film is a classic. Some of my best childhood memories involved me watching this with my dad, it sparked a life-long interest in space and me to become a science major. Whenever I go to the air and space museum, I can't help buy smile like a little kid when I see Gene Kranz's vest in a display case. The special effects have aged well. The educational and entertainment value of this movie are marvelous and I will probably end up buying another release in a few years to show my kids should I ever have them.<br /><br />Now the blu-ray release:<br />All I cared about was picture quality, and in that sense, the release delivers flawlessly. It is not a lousy blu-ray port unlike some I've had to deal with. I had not bothered upgrading from the VHS release because the picture was so crisp for a tape (and was better than some early DVD releases). I held out for a release that had something that made it worth the double dip.<br /><br />Problems with the BD release:<br />Ok, so in order to make the blu-ray look \\"fancy\\", universal has added a bunch of silly junk. You can't really pause the film: it only stays paused for about a minute and then turns to a Universal logo screen saver. You can return to the film eventually.<br />There is also a bunch of superfluous functionality that I haven't bothered messing with because I don't care. I just want the movie in higher quality and that's what I got, so I'm ok.<br />The trailers are a non-issue if your player is not connected to the internet.
1612130283|1.0|This is one of the most horribly written books I have ever read. There is such an obscene amount of repetitive descriptions used I wanted to throw my kindle at the wall. If Ana bit her lip, blushed, or said \\"oh crap\\" to herself one more time, I was going to scream. DON'T BUY THIS.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|How this book became a \\"hit\\" is beyond me.  Based on reviews and word-of-mouth from other moms (like me) it sounded very intriguing and a bit naughty (tsk, tsk) so I figured I'd give it a read.  Well, I have to say that by 75% I was so fed up that I had to stop reading.  I finally had to admit to myself that I couldn't stand the heroine, Anastasia, any longer.  The way she thinks, what she says and does...nope.  And the writing -- suffice it to say that my 13 year old could write better than this.  Broken lines and thoughts and just the silly things that she says just didn't work for me.  Maybe this is why I wasn't a \\"Twilight\\" fan, Bella worked my every last nerve, too.<br /><br />A lot of people say \\"well, certainly the sex kept you interested, right?\\"  Yeah, not so much either.  She was SO uninitiated, and SO out-there acting that it just kind of killed it for me.  I'm sorry, I just can't see any dom who's well into his practice going for a sub like this.  With the kind of money and power that Christian has it was very unbelievable to me that he would want to take this girl under his whip and chains and train her.  Yes, it was hot for a while, then it just became boring to me.
B003F9G8B8|1.0|This movie was a bad attempt at a tribute to Nelson Mandella. Or maybe rugby, it isn't really clear. It lacked any sort of involvement or connection with any of the characters, so that it ended up being a string of one liners delivered by Freeman.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I rarely play games like this, but the food theme really does it for me.  I am still not super keen on the buy with real cash model here, but the game is playable without an actual expenditure.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game is a fun, creative, and an addictive version of a tower defense game. However, it doesn't scale so well on tablets and can stutter sometimes. I wish it could be optimized for the Tegra and incorporate some of the features found on the pc and ipod. Hopefully an update will address this.
0061733199|5.0|Lofty covers a little of everything in his survival manual. This book is a very interesting read (for me anyways) and could potentially save a life. Always a good book for a rainy day..

B001EYU1VO|1.0|Right out of the box, the lower hat directions failed to work.  In addition, the 2 and 5 buttons were dead.<br /><br />Seems junky, but I'll give another one a try as long as shipping is free.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I work night shifts and have found this app to be very reliable for breaks and other tasks. I like the ability to set multiple timers and switch them on or off with a simple checkbox. Plus I can keep multiple timers available and...AND I can tweak each one with custom ringers, length of time and intensity of snooze alarms. You really can't beat it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|ok i have yet to buy the game but seriously? people are complaining that it doesnt have enough levels. but the game was just put out recently. you have to give them time to create more levels. just like angry birds rio
B004LZF2LW|5.0|well I have not tried it yet but it looks really cool.I love to mess around with time including that its time around the world
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I really liked the movie.  Michael Shannon is a quirky actor that always plays odd characters.  He was great in the show Boardwalk Empire and he really shines in this movie.  He is intense and pulled this character off perfectly.  Awesome performance!  Its just my opinion, but i give this movie the thumbs up!
B0055SWM08|5.0|what a great game! lots of relaxing fun and a great way to unwind after a long dayof work or school.
B004LWZW42|5.0|A movie that wasn't supposed to be good. I was getting tired of the X-Men movies, especially after Wolverine, and I knew this was going to suck big time. How wrong I was. This is the best X-Men movie in my opinion and a darn good movie in general. Excellent acting, action, effects and story. This actually felt more grounded than it was supposed to feel and ranks, for me, up there with Nolan's gritty Batman films. Among 2011's comic films, this stole the show. Wasn't supposed to happen but it did. Who knew a simple coin would leave such an impression.
B005L3HKTU|1.0|I could really like this album but whoever put this CD together really did a number to ruin it.<br /><br />Quite possibly this happened as someone tried to jack up the volume levels.<br />The guitars seem especially messed up.<br /><br />I cannot listen to this anymore. This is the kind of rubbish that makes people think mp3s are no worse than CDs. And in this case they will be right.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game so much! This game is very addictive, and it is my first &quot;story&quot; game. Also they don't force you to.spend money on this game. To get gems you just need work hard and get tons of coins from then you can convert your coins to gems.
B005HP2J66|4.0|I know Werner Herzog since Kasper Hauser and his movies with Klaus Kinski. He was by far the most mysterious German filmmaker from his generation. Herzog was quiet for a few years when he came back making documentaries and movies in English. Apparently he became even more embedded in the American movies than Wim Wenders.<br /><br />I revived my interest in Herzog with \\"Grizzly Man\\". It was unknown to me that Herzog has been a documentarist in Germany since the late 60s.  With \\"Grizzly Man\\" I realized that Herzog was a true poet and started to understand his soul. It was very interesting how he confronted the young idealistic who tried to find beauty in nature with the chaos that nature really is.<br /><br />\\"Encounters at the End of the World\\" was less successful. Beside the volcano at the end, that movie was pretty much hollow. I took that as a deliberate attempt. The North Pole is after all a huge quiet desert. Nevertheless I found that movie pretentious.<br /><br />\\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\" is in between.  Sometimes it felt it was a NOVA documentary or I was inside a tour of a major tourist attraction in Europe. But he had some punches here and there. His association between the landscape around the cave and Wager was worthy. The music also complemented. I should add that I watched the movie at home, not in the 3D theater, where the whole experience would have been probably quite different. At the same time, I am over 3D. But with Herzog, we never know...
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is a classic which deserves a space in my bluray rack. I got it on a bluray deal 2 weeks ago. It was awesome. Watched twice since i got it. The preservation is superb, the details are great. Thanks to those who made this possible. Now we can enjoy classic tales in modern video format. A lot of dedication was poured into this box set which  was overflowing with items that really a joy when you see it at first after opening the box. A letter / certificate welcomes you inside the box, a photo album which tells you the history of the movie and a pamplet which was rerinted from the orginal thatwas made 45 years ago, and post crads and a musical box which played the music, \\"My favotire things\\". I recoomend this for everyone who loves music and movies. This one is worth every penny you payed for.

0142410373|5.0|Roald Dahl creates an exciting new tale for all ages to enjoy! Our beloved author is able to create a perfect blend of magic, mayhem, and mystery all in one novel again! Our friend, Mr. Dahl, is an expert at creating a sense of magic in his stories without detracting too much from the main plot, and this story is no different. He has also perfected the craft of creating charming, interesting, and developed characters, even as he presents them for children.<br /><br />The story begins with the explanation of Matilda being born into rather degenerate parents, and they are quite degenerate in many aspects. It is an interesting twist on the trope of children always being lumped with guardians which have less or no blood relation to them, such as the \\"evil step-parent\\" syndrome presented more often than not in stories. No! These are her actual parents! How upsetting! Little Matilda exerts traits of brilliance, but sadly they are stifled by her parents ideals of the important aspects of life in their eyes. \\"Who needs books when you have television?\\" If you thought her parents were atrocious, feast your eyes upon the terrifying Trunchbull.<br /><br />Trunchbull seems as if it were some sort of monster, right? Spot on! She is the headmaster of Matilda's school, and a powerhouse as well, but not in a good sense in the slightest. When she is not practicing her shot-put, she flings around little girls by their pigtails. When she is not belittling heavy-set children for their eating habits, she puts Matilda's worth of a person under a calculator! How horrific! How will Matilda combat against all these evils? Roald Dahl has discovered a clever way that will keep children believing that someday they will accomplish the same as Matilda does!<br /><br />As I read this when I am older, this book brings into light more aspects about it which I had not seen when I was younger. It is incredibly interesting how Matilda settles her conflicts and how the use of magic is applied in this story. The use of magic is unlike other stories of which I am familiar. To keep myself from spoiling, it is incredibly interesting how the conflicts are settled in quite non-violent fashions. These methods are fantastic messages to convey to children as many of them would believe that violence could settle most problems, and especially so with the types of antagonists presented in the story. In a way, the antagonists are also presented in such a fashion that one cannot help but feel sympathy towards them, and this is simply because of how void of compassion and intelligence they can be.<br /><br />Compared to Dahl's other works, this story is one of the more realistic ones. Magic is apparent, but it is not a terribly powerful force nor is it common in Matilda's world. With this realistic setting, this story can allow children to connect with it and feel quite immersed. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age. The story presents itself in such a fashion where children who read for entertainment and literary scholars can enjoy it alike.

1451683405|3.0|I went into this book knowing that Sam Harris concludes that we have no free will, so I wanted to see if he has any compelling new arguments to offer.  Unfortunately, he doesn't.  He pretty much just restates standard arguments, and doesn't do justice to the well-established counterarguments.  Thus, this book isn't a comprehensive or balanced treatment of the topic, but rather just one person's opinion.<br /><br />For example, the experiments he cites don't 'prove' that free will doesn't exist, and their interpretation is much debated.  All we can really reliably conclude from the experiments is that the relationship between consciousness and making choices may be more complicated than is ordinarily supposed.  In addition, the generalizability of these experiments is questionable.<br /><br />Moreover, the book is ultimately self-undermining, because Harris still winds up talking as though we can make choices (eg, with regard to public policy), which presumes that we have at least some freedom of will.  Harris doesn't seem to realize that, in his entirely deterministic universe, the course of the entire future is entirely set and things will just happen as they must - every thought, action, word in his book, word in my review, etc.  And adding an element of randomness doesn't really change anything, since randomness provides no opening for free will to enter.<br /><br />All of this said, Harris does offer some valid insights, so I'm not saying that the book is worthless.  It's just that he goes off the rails too many times, and ultimately winds up in a ditch.  I've personally explored the free will question in some depth, and here are my own thoughts on the topic, some in agreement with Harris and some not:<br /><br />(1) There's no doubt that the universe is at least partially determined. Otherwise, there would be no order, no predictability, no science, no life, and indeed perhaps no universe at all.<br /><br />(2) The strongest arguments for determinism only being partial are that it feels like we have free will, our sense of moral responsibility is consistent with (and requires) free will, and the unpredictability of complex systems makes it possible that they're not entirely determined. Partial determinism thus means that various factors can influence outcomes to various degrees, but no factor or set of factors completely specifies a particular outcome - outcomes are still 'open' to some extent.<br /><br />(3) Partial determinism isn't limited to mathematically-strict physical determinism of the Newtonian/Laplacian kind. It also includes 'looser' forms of determinism such as genetic, biological, evolutionary, psychological, sociocultural, and historical determinism.<br /><br />(4) Fate, predestination, and karma are particular types of partial determinism. There's limited evidence for them, but they're nonetheless interesting possibilities which can't be ruled out, and they need not apply only to individuals - predestination might even apply to the entire universe (eg, Hegel's dialectic unfolding). Accordingly, determinism could be based on 'rational' principles, maybe even some sort of 'grand plan', but it could also be arbitrary (but then what's its origin?).<br /><br />(5) While randomness may be used as a model to deal with our ignorance, it's not clear that randomness can be an intrinsic feature of reality, since we can't imagine what a 'random mechanism' could be like (the word 'mechanism' itself implies determinism, and indeed 'random number generators' are deterministic). Quantum mechanics is perhaps the strongest known candidate for intrinsic natural randomness, but the theory is still silent on a mechanism for the randomness; it's possible that there's a deterministic process underlying the apparent randomness, but that process may be forever hidden from us.<br /><br />(6) With free will, we're proposing that there's an aspect of us, possibly immaterial (consciousness, soul, self, etc.), which is a 'first cause'in the sense of being able to influence our mental experience and physical behavior, without itself being determined by anything else, and without being random either (does that make us demigods?). I suspect that something like this exists, but I have no idea how it could work, and apparently no one else does either. Moreover, difficult questions immediately arise: to what extent do other species have free will (chimps, cats, worms, bacteria, etc.), and how does free will arise during human development starting from conception (eg, an embryo at three weeks)?<br /><br />(7) It's well established observationally and experimentally that our mental experience (including decisions) and physical behavior are at least partially determined by unconscious processes, and moreover these unconscious processes are partially determined by external factors without our conscious awareness. Thus, if our will is associated with our minds, our will is at least partially determined and can't be completely free - at most, our will is partially free. Along the same lines, mental abnormality or illness can also further reduce freedom of the will.<br /><br />(8) Even if the freedom of our will is very limited, belief in free will may be important for the sake of morality, social stability, productivity, meaning, etc. At the same time, recognizing that our will is only partially free can foster tolerance, compassion, forgiveness of ourselves and others, appreciation for fortunate circumstances, acceptance of outcomes falling short of hopes, etc.<br /><br />(9) Our moral values are influenced by emotions and an instinct for justice (likely with an evolutionary basis), and the morality of behavior can be judged in terms of duties/intentions, consequences, or both. Complicating things further, when looking at consequences, we have to consider who's consequences we give importance to, and we also have to consider both the short term and long term. But regardless of how morality is judged, moral judgment can be validly rendered only to the extent that we have freedom of will. And if we have little or no freedom of will, we can still punish people for the sake of quarantining, deterrence, and rehabilitation, but then the decision to punish is itself largely determined rather than free.<br /><br />In short, it seems that we do have a will with an immaterial aspect, and this will is partially free, but not fully free. We can't explain the basis for this freedom of will, but we also can't resist believing that it exists. Thus there is also a basis for moral judgments, but only to the limited extent that a particular individual's will is more or less free.  It seems to me that all of this is close to what most people tacitly believe in everyday life, so the ultimate outcome of these philosophical reflections and analyses may just be a common-sense conclusion. How anti-climactic!in the sense of being able to influence our mental experience and physical behavior, without itself being determined by anything else, and without being random either (does that make us demigods?).

B005LAIGQ4|4.0|My wife and I were living in Barrow back in 1988 when the three California Gray Whales got stuck in the ice near Point Barrow. It was an exciting time and we were eagerly waiting to see the movie --how Hollywood would tell the story.  When the whales were first discovered, I had just started working as the newsperson for local radio station KBRW. Got busy very quickly!<br /><br />It was great to see some places there again, like the Mexican Restaurant ---really named Pepes.<br />And young Ahmaogak Sweeney in the role of Nathan, who learns about the Inupiat Eskimos and their relationships with whales from his Appa, or Grandfather. Nathan also figures out a way to supplement his allowance when some 200 outside Media folks arrived in Barrow and wanted to get out to the Arctic Ocean ice where the whales were trapped.<br />He gathers up some cardboard and sells it to the reporters so their feet won't get cold standing on the ice.<br />I was out there on the ice and don't remember such a thing, but it might have been a good idea.<br /><br />The movie is listed as \\"Inspired by a True Story.\\"  So we were prepared for Hollywood to stretch and substitute.<br /><br />Two major ones:  It was an Inupiat Eskimo hunter, Roy Ahmaogak, who first discovered the stranded whales, not a  newsman.<br />And second ---the Barrow whalers do not hunt the California Gray Whales. They hunt the larger Bowhead whales.<br />The movie includes arguments that a quick rescue was needed so the Native crews would not hunt them.<br />The Whaling captains held their meeting early on, before most media arrived, and said they would do all they could to rescue the whales.<br /><br />One of the movie's strong points is recreating the whales, barnacles and all. And correctly showing how local people and visitors wanted to touch the whales, and sometimes encourage them to hang on.<br />As two of my friends who were wildlife biologists said, it provided a rare opportunity to see such whales close up.<br /><br />The movie also shows how the key to the apparent rescue was low-tech ----the Natives cutting out a series of breathing holes with chain saws and then the water circulators from two caring men from Minnesota which kept the beathing holes open.  And finally the Russian Icebreaker which breaks through a pressure ridge standing between the whales and open water in leads.<br /><br />Did the whales actually make it out and all the way down to their feeding areas off of California and Mexico?<br />The Federal official in charge declared that the survivors did. But they were not fitted with little transmitters. I'd like to think that they did. See the movie for yourself and see what you think<br />Earl/>The movie also shows how the key to the apparent rescue was low-tech ----the Natives cutting out a series of breathing holes with chain saws and then the water circulators from two caring men from Minnesota which kept the beathing holes open.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This product is FANTASTIC!! I loved the series and think Sorkin is brilliant. I paid about $150 including tax & shipping, that's an incredible value for the entire series, I think. The packaging is pretty cool and the DVD's are chalked full of extras that are very interesting and insightful. I bought this one for my parents (since they complain there's nothing good on TV) and have already ordered another for myself. As I said, FANTASTIC, highly recommended.<br /><br />As far as the 2nd West Wing Box Set (the 1 I purchased for myself) I went ahead and purchased a used copy (the original purchase a new copy since if was a gift). As far as the copy for myself being used, all discs functioned perfectly, the booklets included inside, and the outside casing of the box set were all in fantastic condition, practically brand new and certainly could've passed for brand new had they wanted to package it that way. I ended up paying $86 including shipping for this used set that appears brand new which is a heck of a deal for a 7 Season, 45 disc set that had all the extras you could hope for- and useful, informative extras, not those crappy ones that only allow for higher pricing or labeling the product a special edition.  Sorkin's best work in my opinion,  and again, 5 Stars or better for the company in the customer service category, living up to their product description, the speed of their shipping, and the value for the price which again was MORE than reasonable--  used or not $86 including shipping is fantastic, especially for a product that appears and performs as if it was brand new. Fantastic job by the seller! Once again, I'm wonderfully satisfied with a product, seller, and price from a Seller associated with Amazon. I don't know their screening process, my own personal screening from Amazon Sellers is to only use sellers with a 95% seller profile or higher and that has been successful- I've NEVER been disappointed by something done through Anazon, so 5 Stars again, across the board!! The West Wing DVD Box Set Complete Series is a fantastic product and I'd of paid 2 or 3 times the $86, I did pay.  Amazon & you're sellers, you've done it again, another 5+ star rating and satisfied customer leaving my satisfaction record with Amazon at a perfect 100% so thanks again!

0741470314|5.0|This book will give the reader a deeper understanding of who Michael Jackson really was and what he had to deal with. It is breath taking to read about his committment to make the world a better place and to help children in need. And it is heart breaking to read what he simuntanouesly had to deal with, i.e. false allegations, false friends and more. Therefore it is of importance that this book will find its way to the non-fans also, to those who still believe in the picture of Michael Jackson created by the media. Dr Karen Moriarty has done a huge effort in researching and in putting all those facts together in a book for us all to take part of.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|The story line for this movie was horrible at best.  The graphics saved the movie.  Immortals was a dissappointment from my perspective.
B000VECADA|4.0|it's huge box when this stuff has coming. A lot suprises because i don't see dvd. I see a big figure in box and dvd was on sculpture. Why i buy this edition because i like this figure. Picture quality 4/5 and have 2 disc at this edition. of course if you want to compare the blu-ray version of the audio specs are very different. Blu-ray audio is uncompressed audio compared to dvd. If u like this figure u can buy if cheap. but if u like picture and highly audio u can choose blu-ray version
B0049P1VHS|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />After watching these 2 DVDs, I could not believe what I had found. This is a TV SHOW that is MUCH MORE SUSPENSEFUL & GRIPPING than many other horror movies. Not only it contains horror but it also cleverly deals with some psychological matters. For example, it reveals troubles in friendship, and marriage. On top of that, it emphasizes parental love. There are many scenes that emotionally tortured me. For example, some of them forced me to answer the question \\"What would you do if your close friend betrayed you?\\"<br /><br />This is one of the few TV SHOWS that are so entertaining and yet so unsettling at the same time. It's ONE of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in  terms of horror and suspense.

0553106635|5.0|WIth over 900 reviews written of the third book in George R .R. Martin's series, there is little I can add in terms of plot points, therefore I will be brief.  Following [[ASIN:B000FC1HBY A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two]], the civil war between the various contenders continues, the principle characters evolving, readers given glimpses of events before the ascention of Robert Baratheon.  As in his previous books, a several significant characters are eliminated, the story ending with a climax, feeling somewhat like a cliff-hanger ending of a television serial.<br /><br />Of the three books so far, I like this rather more than the previous two.  While there is less action (in terms of battle and combat), there is much more intrigue and attention given to character development and filling in the back story, which I enjoyed tremendously.  I also enjoyed Martin's nuance in terms of his characters: those who have been the \\"bad guys\\" are given complexity that, if not softening them, at least makes them more human.  Likewise, the ruthlessness with which Martin treats his characters was refreshing. While I was suprised and saddened with the passing of some of the characters, the unpredictability, randomness and rawness of the violence makes the story more compelling, I think.  So far, a recommended series.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have been using a Polar heart rate monitor for about 6 years.  It still works, but I was interested in a monitor that could track my heart rate and display a record during my workout.  My usual workout is built around weight lifting, done at a pace so that it doubles as a cardio workout.  I also started jogging again, for variety and to gauge the effectiveness of the weight training in maintaining cardo fitness.  The GPS feature was appealing for my once a week runs.<br /><br />After poring over the reviews of this model and the 110 (including the one-star reviews, which I always read), I chose the 405CX.  I have had it for about 10 days now, so I don't know how durable and reliable it will be.  I do know that it has far exceeded my expectations in its usefulness.<br /><br />This arrived on a Friday and I spent about an hour or so on Saturday morning setting it up and then went out for a run.  I had the pace set to be measured every mile.  I ran on a course that I had run 20+ years ago, which was 1.5 miles in length and had landmarks every 1/2 mile (or so I thought).  I found out that I was a little off in my measurements, not by a lot but maybe 4-5%.  I also found out that one of the beauties of this device is that you don't have to use a set course - you just run.  Instead of going around the same loop 2 and 2/3 times to get to 4 miles in total, I reversed course to run on the other side of the road.  This changed the impacts on my legs as I switched the leg facing the crown of the road.  This would be very useful in running in unfamiliar locations, say out in the woods.<br /><br />The Auto Lap feature was great for giving you periodic assessments of your speed.  I think the one mile setting is great - you could use  a smaller increment to get closer to an instantaneous measure. You can also set it as you go along.  The really neat thing was when I got home and downloaded the data, I had a chart of speed, distance and heart rate, measured every 5 seconds.  I canreview how my body reacted to increased effort and how I did against my maximum heart rate.  When I go to my usual weight workouts, I turn off the GPS and just measure heart rate.  This gives me a pretty good idea of my intensity and pace.  Needless to say, the heart rate is much more variable between sets and exercises when I switch, compared to the constant effort in running.  I can also see much more effort (higher heart rate) when I work on my legs versus the upper body.<br /><br />I look forward to building up more data over the months (and years?) to gauge my fitness and also to use this for running (or walking) over unknown terrain and courses.  Oh, it also shows your elevation as a function of time; I can see my heart rate go up as I run up a grade.<br /><br />Finally, I notice that a number of the 1 star reviews felt that the lack of an instant pace measure is a fatal omission. I think the Virtual Partner feature (which I have not used, but plan to soon) would be an excellent substitute.  You can set your target pace and the watch will tell you how far ahead or behind of the target you are.  This is really even better than a display of instant pace, in my HO.<br /><br />This HRM is a bit complicated, but the complications are worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE-<br /><br />I finally used the Virtual Partner and I think it's even more useful than a display of instant pace.  The VP display shows you how far behind or ahead your are relative to your target pace; when you are behind there is a dark background and a clear background when you are ahead.  This is very helpful when you want to avoid going too hard at first (and slowing down later) or when you have a goal pace you aspire to.  With the auto scroll, the watch shows time and distance, then heart rate, then your pace relative to target.  With this setup, there's no need to touch the watch other than to start it, stop it, or set a lap.<br /><br />The menus can be a little confusing and the bezel can be a bit quirky in response, but I have gotten more used to it in the 3 weeks + I have used this watch.  Still very pleased with it and the battery seems to last longer than I anticipated.  The download to Garmin Connect is great; the ANT+ receiver has detected the watch when I was upstairs and the computer is downstairs.

1451627289|3.0|I can't understand why people, especially reviewers, are going ga-ga over this book. It begins quite well, but slides into sloppy cliches and unrealistic reactions to situations (am I the only one who thinks that King's characters crack jokes at times when no one would ever crack a joke?). The ending is just terrible. Without spoiling, let me just say that King could have created an interesting and subtle ending if the main character had returned to the present and slowly discovered what had been changed. Instead, we get bullet points and, for some unknown reason, earthquakes. Not to mention that this novel really needed an editor's pen...I found myself laughing out loud at some of the sentence gaffs.  The novel was also way too long.  Is King now so famous that no one bothers to fix his mistakes?<br /><br />I wanted to like this novel; I really did. There were a few great moments: especially the joke about killing your grandfather and the idea of the past resisting change, sort of like gravity resisting flight or someone doing the high jump.  But in the end, it collapsed into the kind of ending that sixth graders write. Disappointing.<br /><br />Of course, it will be a best-seller. And it will probably get made into a movie. My advice is to sav

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to admit, the premise of this book sounded very childish and plain stupid to me initially.  It sounded much more boring than it really is.  I imagined it being like a gladiator tournament, but there's much more to it than that.  Because of the countless rave reviews and my friends who've never not recommended it, I finally decided to read it.  I'm a relatively slow reader even with books I'm thoroughly enjoying, but I blazed through this.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins writing is utterly phenomenal.  She writes characters in such a way that we see their flaws and qualities without being beaten over the head with them.  She writes every character in the book with their own distinct personalities and I ended up feeling like I understood each character on numerous levels.<br /><br />Collins' biggest quality as a writer is her ability to explain details.  She gives vivid details on the setting, facial expressions, body language, etc.  Often I've read novels that while I'm enjoying the plot, I have a difficult time imagining what the author is trying to describe.  Or sometimes I see an author is describing too much making the pace very slow.  Collins finds a perfect balance that had me reading this novel in a matter of days (which I usually take extended breaks from novels).<br /><br />This is one of a few books I've ever read that had me leaning in while reading to see what's going to happen.  I was anxious to get back to the book after a day or so.  Can't recommend this enough.

B005LAIGN2|2.0|The story of Negro soldiers in the Civil War was ably told in the film \\"Glory\\".  I was hoping for a movie of that quality about the Tuskegee Airmen, but was disappointed. Lucas ended up making a heroic story a rather ordinary war movie with all of the stock war movie characters:  the rebellious hot-shot who doesn't like to follow orders, the straight-as-an-arrow flight leader dealing with his own inner demons, the baby-faced youngster, and the strummin' jokester, who seemed to me to be a jarring racial stereotype.  There is also the sinister, Darth Vader-like, Nazi pilot and a lame love story.  I don't think Lucas displays an original idea throughout this entire film.  The story of the Tuskegee flyers cries out for a treatment like HBO's \\"Band of Brothers\\" mini-series.  The CGI, however, is the most amazing I have ever seen.  Perhaps that, for WW2 aviation buffs, makes it worth the price of admission.

B005TBN3EU|1.0|*1/2<br /><br />There's barely a laugh to be had in \\"The Hangover - Part 2,\\" a dreadful sequel to the original box office smash from 2009.<br /><br />This time the boys - and I do mean \\"boys\\" - are trapped in Thailand, where they've gone to celebrate Stu's nuptials and where they immediately fall into a series of misadventures after a riotous night of bachelor party celebration in Bangkok, all of which has been mysteriously erased from their collective memory.<br /><br />I wish I could say that, from all this, hilarity ensues. But I would be lying.  As with most big-budget studio comedies these days, the tone and the performances are pitched so over-the-top that the audience winds up feeling assaulted rather than entertained long before the closing credits come rolling by.  To that end, the  screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin and director Todd Phillips is filled with wheezy plot mechanics, overwrought action sequences, mind-numbing slapstick, and jokes that fall consistently flat.<br /><br />The buddies are once again played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis and a much under-used Justin Bartha (who may have been the only one career-conscious and savvy enough to ask to be left out of most of the proceedings), while Paul Giamatti and Ken Jeong - who is much funnier on TV's \\"Community\\" - have been added to the cast.<br /><br />By any standard but the most crassly commercial - the movie garnered an impressive quarter of a billion dollars in domestic box office receipts - \\"The Hangover - Part2\\" is a colossal bomb.

Can she survive this time? What about Peeta? Is it all a plot by the Capitol to put an end to her life to teach the Districts a lesson?<br /><br />I read it straight through in one weekend.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Looking back on this singer after so many years we put the cd on and what image comes to mind of her. I do form an image! The would be movie star of a league of her own(1982)a good baseball movie but disappointing with sean penn in<br />shanghai  surprise. The movie career never showed her at her best. The book which made a splash across the world of all those revealing photos!I recall that book and the fuss it made. All those concerts,with the young in attendance but not all taking a liking to the image she put out...she was always front and center. Very often actually even she found support,from religious authors finding her religosity animating discussion,to many other quarters realizing after all she was a performer,what is the reality and the image? Of course we bought into the image,and of course there were those adoptions. The videos...those old videos on tv,the marilyn impressions,the spanish song,and the many others sometimes campy but essentially erotic and the songs very good and voice performance. The performance in everything she did was there...so i look back when i listen to her cd's,and i listened to her from her onset,and there really wasnt much really bad about her,just about her erotic image and the effect it had on youth,but out of the studio clothes and away from the<br />image in interviews she was plain and simple,a good singer and showgirl. So I was late in playing this cd,and the image is all set and just the songs flow again,and i need not talk of that,they are interesting and good as always,she still has that great voice,sounds just like when she first started out and the spanish tune and the songs of finding love ring closest to the heart...i just bought her new cd and she became probably the greatest singer and image maker<br />in modern music

B003EYVXVE|4.0|The concepts and themes in \\"The Hunger Games\\" are nothing new. It is basically an amalgam of \\"The Running Man\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", a Japanese movie that was banned in the United States until just recently called, \\"Battle Royale\\" and the television show \\"Survivor.\\" \\"Hunger Games\\" may have borrowed its concepts, but it certainly made the most of them.<br /><br />\\"Hunger Games\\" started as a novel in 2008 written by Suzanne Collins. In the not-too-distant future, North America has collapsed and it has been divided into 12 districts. A law was passed after the 12 districts rose up against their government and failed.  The law was that in order to keep the peace the districts would randomly select a boy and a girl to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a brutal, televised, survival fight to the death in which only one participant would emerge the victor.<br /><br />It is a touchy concept pitting children against each other in a fight to the death. It was touchy enough of a concept that Japan's version of putting children against each other in the fight to the death, \\"Battle Royale\\" was only just now released in the United States despite its release in 2000. Although \\"Battle Royale\\" chose a more gory route and chose to emphasize the violence, \\"Hunger Games\\" chose to emphasize the personality of its main character, Katniss Everdeen, and the humanity inside her despite her surroundings.<br /><br />\\"Hunger Games\\" may on the surface seem like an ugly and depressing film and it can be, but it also is a challenging and thought provoking film about government control and not letting the world around you define who you are. Jennifer Lawrence (X:Men First Class & Winters Bone) plays the main character Katniss, a girl who has learned to live off the land, hunt and survive. Her experience with a bow and surviving in the woods gives her a leg up for the toughest part of the game, surviving in difficult environments. Yet, that didn't train her for the other part of the game, having to take another human's life.<br /><br />\\"Hunger Games\\" never once falters in keeping its audiences interest. It is from beginning to end, a suspense thriller that has you hooked into the characters lives and the dire situation they are facing. Some of its authenticity is lost in the studio making a financial decision to make sure they got a PG-13, but only enough to make what could have been a great film into just a good one.<br /><br />There are two more books in the \\"Hunger Games\\" series, \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\", and I for one will be waiting with great anticipation for the release of those movies as well.ng to take another human's life.<br /><br />\\"Hunger Games\\" never once falters in keeping its audiences interest.

0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain's book is brilliant. It displays many scientists theories on the behavior of the human brain. This allows the reader to draw conclusions about the research as a whole. We follow Susan to Tony Robins seminars, Saddleback Church, and seminars to teach introverts how to defy the odds and master public speaking. We are shown how the creative population is mostly introverted and see how sharing our ideas can benefit everyone.<br /><br />For me personally, this book was a breath of fresh air. You see that introverted people view the world on amuch deeper plain than their extroverted counterparts. They are thoughtful and intuitive where the extraverts seem bold as well as superficial. Introverts crave deep conversation and tend to not understand people who can talk about nothing. A current social ideology is laid out that extroversion is better, but it is unbalanced. Introverts are brilliant, creative, and aware of danger. There is a great need for them in society. Solitude and carefully processed thoughts are beneficial to all of society. The book is full of details and scientific facts, but Susan Cain is an excellent writer that carried these points within her story. Quiet also helped me to understand extroverts. Great read.

B005LAII0S|3.0|\\"Mirror Mirror\\" is \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" in an alternate universe. The creators have taken many liberties with the story that we all grew up with and are familiar with. Snow White (Lily Collins) lives in the castle with the Queen (Julia Roberts) because her father, the King, has disappeared in the woods and has been gone for years. There is a mirror and there is an apple and there are seven dwarfs, but the story isn't the same and most notably, the Dwarfs aren't named Dopey, Doc, Sleepy etc. etc. They are given new names like Napoleon, Half Pint, Grub, Butcher, Chuckles, Grimm and Wolf.<br /><br />\\"Mirror Mirror\\" is a light-hearted movie that can be enjoyed by all members of the family and that is the best part about it. While Julia Roberts' Evil Queen is certainly evil, vain, self-centered and short sighted, she does so with wit and charm that is more like a pampered New York Socialite than the devilish queen we're familiar with. Snow White is the subject of that thing that happens once or twice a year where dueling movie studios both had the same idea and see who's film does better. For a more twisted and devilish taste of Snow White, you'll have to wait for \\"Snow White and the Huntsmen\\" slated for June with Twilight's Kristen Stewart.<br /><br />This version is creative and refreshing but unfortunately hampered with comedy that doesn't really make you laugh all that much, although the dwarves did make me laugh a few times. The story is creative but really doesn't have a whole lot of meat to it or make you feel like there is anything vital at stake. The Queen's stranglehold on the community around her isn't felt enough. Snow White's relationship with the dwarves grows too quickly and we never get a chance to feel it.<br /><br />Ultimately, despite all the big name stars in the film, the production seemed sort of cheap and the script lacked flair. The movie is mostly a combination of \\"The Princess Bride\\" and \\"Ella Enchanted\\" but doesn't capture either one of those films magic. It tries to and it definitely has its moments, but \\"Mirror Mirror\\" sort of falls flat. The only magic is that they managed to cast the perfect people, but still weren't able to gel the story into something that made you feel anything about what was happening on screen.ne of those films magic.

B003Y5H5BA|4.0|\\"21 Jump Street\\" is only loosely based on the original television show that starred mega star Johnny Depp. The only real reason for comparison is the premise of police officers given orders to return to high school and pose as teenagers. They are instructed to infiltrate and bring down a synthetic drug manufacturing and distribution ring. Jonah Hill (Moneyball) plays Schmidt, a former high school nerd and current police officer newbie with skills of the brain, but no physical skills. Channing Tatum (The Vow) plays Jenko, who is just the opposite. Together, they are a perfect fit and a disaster waiting to happen.<br /><br />\\"21 Jump Street\\" is a lot of fun and always entertaining. The movie introduces you to the characters and their personalities. You know them and you relate to them. The story is even fairly intriguing, which isn't always the case in movies like these. As Schmidt finds himself getting over all the things that plagued him in high school, you find yourself rooting for him.<br /><br />There are constant jokes and laughs throughout the movie. Although, I did notice that many of the best laughs were spoiled by previously released promotional materials. Thankfully there are plenty of laughs to go around. The movie never lets up and is always interesting, funny and strangely endearing. It is also hilarious watching the two cops return to high school and finding the ways of the past to be just that. Jenko blames the phenomenon simply on the television show, \\"Glee\\".<br /><br />Sure the movie is offensive at times, but the chemistry between Tatum and Hill is authentic and fun to watch. You get invested in their characters personalities early on and you are with them to the end.
B000TETIJ6|1.0|Meatloaf, redact this crap.  Go back to the drawing board and include Steinman this time.  How could you tarnish the Bat out of Hell brand with this crap?
B0063IH60K|4.0|A fun game!  Easy to play and includes several options to keep it interesting.  The graphics are sharp and clear.  Very nice!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I first played this game I was hooked. I would spend hours just to defeat those pigs. My kids are even hooked on this game.
B000MGVCFO|5.0|Well, I have bought two of these now from different sellers and neither one of them will work at all. Not in 5.1 sacd, sacd cd or cd stereo (red book). It looks like a bad batch is going through. I would give the music 5 stars but can't since the cd's won't work. I also have the rest of the Moody Blues sacd series and they all work fine.<br /><br />4-16-12<br />I just received a used copy from the EU in like new condition and it works just fine! Found it used on Amazon for $18.50. Third time is a charm!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|FUN!  sooo additive!  worth buying!  I could play all day!<br /> Differently worth the purchase!! still waiting for the other planet to open though
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just getting to know my new Kindle.  Defending Jacob was one of the first books recommended to read...so I ordered it!  Having 7ish books on my Kindle to choose to read at any given time I could not pull away from seeing what was happening with Jacob and his family.  It's a situation any family could end up in in our culture today!  The dynamics were real.....Great book.
B00417HUV0|5.0|I LOVED THIS ALBUM WHEN IT WAS ON CASSETTE AND KEPT LOOKING FOR IT ON CD.  THESE ARE SUCH A GREAT ROCK SONGS.  I ALWAYS DANCE IN THE HOUSE, IN THE CAR AND AM SINGING AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS.  WAY TO GO TWISTED SISTER.  VERY EXCELLENT!!
B0076794IO|5.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this book, however you have to concentrate so that you do not miss anything. This is the best thriller that I have read to date. Excellent
B002VX0A40|4.0|A coworker told me the importance of getting married or having a baby in the year of a dragon. I ordered 4 of these for myself and 3 friends who are also pregnant. They are very well made and even though the dragon is pink it's good for a boy baby too...
B006JSXYPA|5.0|The vendor mailed the movie quickly and it was new and the movie was great. Will order other movies from vendor.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|This film is a disaster. I kept waiting for it to bait me but it never did. The film moved along to fast.<br /> I still prefer the Swedish version of this movie. It creeps up on you slowly and uncoils like a snake. It had that \\"Ah Hah\\" moment that I did not get from the American Version.<br />  I just wanted to remove the disc from DVD player and watch the Swedish version again....<br />  I thought Rooney Mara was horrible as Salander(And everyone has their own opinion). The locations were nice in this film. As they were in the Swedish version also.<br />  And I have read the books. I have enjoyed all three. And I also understand that the American movie version is closer to the book. But I still would recommend for folks to watch the Swedish version of this movie........
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Absolutely fun and addicting game.  Anyone can play this (even my 5 and 6 year old get it), it's so easy... just try it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best biblical app ive tried ever!! absolutely wonderful read...love all the extra options it has...the plan options are great! the sharing option...awesome!! what can I say...this app is truely sent from above:-) I recommend it to anyone who is really serious about getting right with GOD!!! thoughts &amp; prayers r with anyone who reads this review!!!
1594203334|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought it could give new mothers a different option in how to bring up their children. I especially liked how she explained that French women didn't give up their identities to become just \\"Mom,\\" but kept active in their work and interests.
B005IZLPME|5.0|I received the movie quickly from the vendor. The movie was Great!! I will order more movies from this vendor.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was a page turner, but I found myself growing increasingly irritated with the author's use of words. Holy crap, holy hell, holy s**t, oh my, inner goddess, my subconscious; the list goes on and on. I would cringe every time I read about Ana's inner goddess. The writing is sophomoric at best.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these characters, but \\"flushing\\"(she flushes ever couple of paragraphs!) Ana is beyond frustrating, and Christian is a major a-hole. I cannot fathom how a smart girl would choose this man for her very first relationship. The emotion evoked most was anger towards these two idiots. She sees all the reasons why she shouldn't be with him, yet she cannot help herself. She has the classic beaten-woman's way of thinking, \\"I can change this guy.\\"<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this one star was because I did find myself captivated, hoping that this girl would wisen up and run for the hills. ***SPOILER*** Unfortunately, I have started to read the second book and within just a few pages it is clear Ana is going to continue to get spanked and punished for simply rolling her eyes and effed for biting her lip. I cannot honestly say that I will make it all the way through this one. The repetitiveness of the author's words is despicable. I cannot believe they are planning on making this a movie. Any sensible actor would pass on these rolls.
0062124293|3.0|Parts of this, I loved. I laughed so hard, it was hard to contain myself. Moments such as: \\"I don't want children anyway,\\" Caz says. \\"So I am getting nothing out this whatsoever (her period). I want my entire reproductive system taken out and replaced with spare lungs, for when I start smoking.\\"<br /><br />At other times, it seems the author pontificates endlessly. I think pube hairs can be summed up in three pages or less. I didn't need an entire chapter. I also didn't care for all the masturbating, but that's just me.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Non stop problems with this game.  It crashed over and over! Froze up about 199 times. It was an all around waste.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|Though I am tempted, I'm not going to spend hours writing a HUGE review...not that this album doesn't deserve it, but in the interest of time, and to avoid repeating what others have already said, I'll try my best to keep this short and sweet. Like others, prior to FC's realease, I was intimately familiar with every member's catalog, save for McPherson. Regardless, I honestly didn't know what to expect. I just figured it would be good. Was I right? Not even close...it's f'ng amazing!!! There is SO much great music packed into FC's 47 minutes. True, there are hints of so many great bands behind what must have inspired their writing (Yes, Beatles, Queen, Genesis, Dregs, et. al.), but none more so than others and no blatant rip-offs.  Ok, Brian May MIGHT do a double take if/when he hears the solo on \\"Love Is What I'm Waiting For\\", but other than that...;-). Each song inspires different emotions...hope, fear, love, sorrow, happiness, and regret...to name a few. Very impressive. Another pleasant surprise was how restrained Steve, Dave, and Mike were...or more accurately, how well they tailored their talents to bring something amazing, yet appropriate, to each song. Let's face it, these guys have the chops to blow the roof of the joint, but they never let that interfere with any of their contributions to each of FC's songs. And what a find Casey McPherson was. I can't believe I hadn't heard of him before, but I'm looking forward to hearing more of him. His tone and range fit FC's songs perfectly. Bottom line, FC delivers an amazing variety of powerful, emotional, impactful, well written songs that a wide range of listeners will enjoy. Great stuff guys! I hope to catch one of your shows in the not too distant future!
0792164903|4.0|Last night's movie was \\"Sleepy Hollow.\\" We bought it off the DVD bargain rack and I'm surprised to find it there. In a lot of ways, it's a really excellent movie. First, the filming is just wonderful and fit's the story so well. Those dark gloomy woods are wonderful and the film sites within the woods are just marvelous. A lot of efforts went into these sets, believe me. Costumes too. It's just a well done movie! And the accompanying music by Danny Elfman suits the background and story so well and is a pleasure to listen to in itself. While watching the film, I wondered if there was an available soundtrack. I checked and there is. It figures. I haven't checked, but I could easily imagine this movie gathering in a bunch of Academy Award nominations or other awards of that type. It's that good!<br /><br />Okay, so what do I think of the story? It's drivel. Anytime there's a lot of superstitions, rotting bodies, ghosts, a headless guy riding a black horse at night and looking for his head, well, my mind just goes blank. It's a pile of supernatural stuff and my mind just doesn't understand. I'm a realist. This movie is unmitigated gibberish. I have the same problem with religion. Give me a lot of supernatural hocus-pocus and my mind just turns off. I can't help it. But, it's a reconstruction of a highly acclaimed work of literature. It's been a classic fiction story way back from when I was an undergraduate fifty years ago. So, it's highly acclaimed drivel. It's still drivel. But, people love the story and just look at all the high ratings. Well, to each his or her own. I enjoy Star Trek and that's drivel too, but it's tongue-in-cheek drivel. This is serious drivel. What can I say? I'm sure the majority of people wound love this movie and it's so well done. My advice would be to see it and decide for yourselves. You may well enjoy it, even immensely.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So convenient.  I love it.  It definitely helps me stay on top of my weekly studies.  I even plan to use it while I'm in church.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I am a super hero/comic junkie. this movie was fantastic I don't know why it was getting bad reviews especially the reviews \\"its a super hero movie so its bad\\" if you don't like super hero or comic movies why are you buying it and then complaining. ryan reynolds did a great job and I was skeptical of it when I heard he was playing  green lantern but he did a wonderful job. I hope they make a sequel! great movie
B00689J512|5.0|Great value! I have been dancing around ever since I bought it. It has some good collaborations on it as well!
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Nice looking interface &amp; options to change fonts &amp; the look of it. I added 3 clocks for the different parts of the world my family is. its nice yo know the exact time they are now. I like the ICS font, the fact that is easy to use &amp; that it gives the user options to choose from. great work!
B002ZG999U|1.0|This movie just basically piled up all the cliches from 80s action movies and delivered them in one piece starring some top notch action movie veterans. The thing is, back then they were all really great because what they said was sincere. That is how people spoke in the 80s and how scripts were written. It wasnt meant to be cheesy in the 80s, which is what makes them so fun to watch now. The \\"unintentionality\\" of it all. But now it is being done intentionally to be cheesy and it is really out of time so it is just not funny anymore or appealing. The characters are all cliches and one dimensional with no discerning personalities and in fact the only thing that distinguishes them is the method with which they prefer to kill. It is like X men for non mutants.<br /><br />The story itself was boring and drab and told a dozen times before. In fact the story served to merely move the action along. Whether you got it or not, or paid attention or not, it would not have made a difference and doesnt matter.<br /><br />The actors also felt out of time. Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren and Mickey Rourke were just not believable as tough guys of a secret assassin squad. In fact, it was embarrassing. Stallone looked like he was constipated and he had that bloat and just overall leathery stiffness. He was barely inhabiting his role and there just wasnt any passion or even personality in his character. He also looked tired. They all did, except for the younger actors. I could go non but suffice it so say, it's a bad movie that will probably only appeal to the simple minded with poor taste. These actors were great in their own time, but now they just feel like some old guys going through a hippie revival.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am usually very tentative about getting involved in book series that get made into movies. I read Harry Potter, but refused and still refuse to take part in Twilight. But every time I saw the trailer for this movie, I wanted to know more about the story. This book was an easy and hard to put down read. It had showed humanity at it's worst and at the same time, showed how strong community can be and how having a little courage can get you far in life. I won't talk about the plot, cause I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but it's definitely worth buying the trilogy and not just the first book to see how it all unfolds and comes full circle.<br /><br />Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I have never played this version of the game before, but I don't get why it is free 4 the aneroid and 2.99 4. the kindle fire. In my opinion, that is not fair!
0743424425|3.0|In his own intro. Stephen King said his goal at the time was to write 3,000 words per day. It shows. To me, this book felt wordy. And yet somehow the themes seem only partially developed. Are the \\"ghosts\\" metaphors for our parents? Are the \\"ghosts\\" metaphors for corrupt and evil amongst rich and respectable people that gets swept under the rug only to resurface? None of the above? But if none of the above, why even put in the back story of Jack's father and Horace Derwent?<br /><br />And why is Jack allowed to be seen as such a victim? The poor guy is driven by his abusive father, or maybe it's his alcoholism, or maybe it's the ghosts in the hotel. It's all so softened in the end after King gets off to such a good start in suggesting maybe Jack enjoys hurting people for the sake of hurting them--whether it's Danny or his \\"stuttering\\" student or his friend Al or his wife Wendy. Maybe King felt Jack was a bit too much like him so he had to design all kinds of rationalizations for him? What starts out feeling like a confessional morphs into an argument against free will and responsibility.<br /><br />The juxtaposing a party for socialites with horrific violence works beautifully--right out of something like Gravity's Rainbow although I don't know if King ever read that.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|After being dumped for the nineteenth time by a Katherine (no, not one girl playing with his heart -  nineteen separate individuals named Katherine), Colin realizes it's now or never: this summer (the summer after high school graduation) is his last chance to go from child prodigy to adult genius.<br /><br />Colin allows his high-octane friend Hassan (who is all sorts of awesome) to talk him into going on a road trip. They'll both get what they want: Hassan avoids college for another year, while Colin works on a math theorem for predicting whether a relationship is going to end and who is going to end it. And yes, there is math in the book. But this is math about relationships. Math with real-world applications. The sort of thing we WISH we'd been learning in Algebra II.<br /><br />I love this book so much it's impossible to review with any real coherence. Wit, humor, brilliant-but-insecure kid, awesome best friend, adventure...
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its fun if you're a fan of simulated games such as The Sims or Sim City! It's a little tricky with the controls, but once you get the hang of it, its a breeze
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My book club chose to read The Hunger Games in hopes of seeing the movie together.  When I went on the search for the book I found the trilogy for less so I got it.  I am so glad I did because I will definitely be reading all three!
B005K2XM94|5.0|Perfect fit and protects Kindle nicely.  Well made..would recommend this product to keep your Kindle safe when not in use.
B0018CENUC|5.0|I'm a huge country fan and Toby Keith's Biggest hits is a definite must have. Doesn't include Wayman's Song or Red Solo cup since they are a little too new but well worth the money otherwise.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I purchased the triology for my iPad and I couldn't put it down!  All three of these books were great.  I finished all of them within a week. Each of the books draws you in and you want to know what happens. Worth every penny.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Needed this to convert my TV audio out to a pair of wireless headphones. Easy to install, works great. Best priced unit on the market
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Like I keep repeating, I buy these movies because I love them<br />I've already watched it, 3 times and it's in perfect condition, no bugging or freezing!<br />Thanks
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can I say? It's solitaire. If you like the card game, you'll love it. Best thing about it? You can customize the look using your own photos.
B00288KNLS|4.0|I have to admit I'm a little disappointed in the fact that this DVD uses the \\"colored\\" style glasses that come with the DVD instead of the \\"sunglasses\\" type I already have with my LG 3-D set.  Since my daughters and I all wear glasses, the \\"sunglasses\\" style fits better over our  own glasses.
0671027344|5.0|I have read a lot of books in my short 31 Years of life. I've actually read more classics than any other person I know including my best friend, a literature professor in major university in Florida.... and i have to say, this book is in my TOP 5 of all time favorites.<br /><br />It astonishes me how brutally honest this book is... how it pulls you back to that time, when everything was \\"simpler\\" but yet so much more complicated.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, please do. It is well worth it. If you have children, let me read it, they will identify.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|If you're a fan of Robert Downy Jr. you'll love this movie. Tom Cruise should also play more parts like this. Two thumbs up.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|It always always says 403 forbiden (rate limit exeded) HELP.If you don't know how to deal with this PLZ don't get.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I waited so long for this book to come out because I love \\"The Name of the Wind.\\"  I recommended the book to everyone I know.  \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" is a big let down from the first installment.  I hate to say it because I wanted to love this book.  The author is a great writer; he has a really good grasp on the english language.  His wording and his phrasing are great.  The problem is the direction of the story.  I love stories about the coming of age of a great character.  This part of Kvothe's life is just bizarre.  Did Mr. Rothfuss needed to include Kvothe's pubescent escapades that are dictated by the male hormone?  Kvothe = Casanova?  That threw me off and just made it so...odd and uncharacteristic of the author's style.  It is unfortunate.  It doesn't live up to \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" but it's not bad, just not a wow for me.  I'm a fan of this author so I will probably read the third installment to see what happens to Kvothe.  I really do hope that it retains the coolness of the first book in the next installment.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I was having some really high hopes for \\" Tinker Tailor..\\", because A) I am a fan of Garry Oldman who has an Oscar nomination for his role here, B) I like spy based films, and C) it had what it seems to be a solid cast<br />but I was hugely disappointed with this film.<br />now i knew before hand that it was a drama and had no action scenes, and that it was nothing like James Bond movies, and i had no problems with that because I really do enjoy most movies, even ones that moves in slow pace.<br />I just recently finished watching [[ASIN:B005TJ7EFG Melancholia]] which was not a Spy film, but was very slow paced like Tinker Tailor and more of an artistic film which is not for everyone to appreciate, but i found it very enjoyable.<br /><br />Sadly, Tinker Tailor was really really boring, it was slow paced and its major problem was that it was confusing and difficult to follow, I didn't know what was going on half the time, and nor how Smiley found the russian mole !<br />scenes were jumping from one place to another, and flashbacks were suddenly dropped within current events in the film adding much to the confusion,<br />I didn't read the book nor watch the TV series, which might have helped, but, if someone had to read the book to understand the movie, then the movie is a failure !<br /><br />Now Gary Oldman deserves the nomination, his acting was top notch, and i also found the 70s feel to the film quite impressive, but the script really ruined the whole film for me despite these positive points.<br /><br />the other main characters, including the ones played by Colin Firth, John Hurt and Mark Strong were poorly developed and seemed empty, i got lost between them,<br /><br />there is a fine line between an intelligent film and a confusing one, and while Tinker Tailor tried to be some what intelligent, it fell short and ended up being a pile of muddiness,<br />don't get me wrong, i like films that tries to make you think and don't spell all the story out for you, butthis one makes you dull rather than thinking because of its unclear confusing plot.<br />avoid it
B007N6NGYG|3.0|This review is written on a Samsung Epic 4G, rooted, with CyanogenMod 7.2 RC0.  The game works, but for reasons that are not clear to me, it makes my smartphone completely unstable.<br /><br />The 3D graphics are based on Unity 3D and you have to steer the trains by switching the tracks around so that the appropriate color train goes into the correct station.  I played the first 4 levels and the game gets difficult very quickly, but the graphics and sound are excellent and if I didn't have the stability issues, I would rate this as 4 stars without hesitation.  Cyanogenmod 7.2 made my Epic 4G rock solid, so and when I removed the game from my smartphone, my smartphone no longer randomly crashes.  Too bad.<br /><br />UPDATE for 4/16/2012.  I removed several other applications on my phone that I don't use and uninstalled and reloaded this game after several reboots and this application doesn't seem to be forcing my phone to reboot anymore.  This is the second application I have had that initially caused my phone to reboot, so I'm going to give this a 3/5 stars.  If several months go by from this date without issues, I will consider giving this application 4 stars because ignoring the reboot issue, the game is generally good, ignoring the knuckleheads that chose to rate this comment as unhelpful.<br /><br />UPDATE for 6/23/2012.  I later completely reformatted my micro SD Card (SanDisk 32 GB) and reinstalled most applications one by one and the application seems to run flawlessly, so something triggered all that crashing that hasn't been seen since.  I have read on various forums that some people do have mysterious micro SD card problems with some Android phones, so maybe that has something to do with this.  My older daughter likes this game too.  I'm planning on getting the Asus Transformer Infininty later this year and if the game looks good on that tablet, I'll give the application 4 stars if it runs without the same original installation issues I had with my SamsungEpic 4G CyanogenMod 7.2 RC0 phone.  If the developer adds the other two advertised levels, I'll re-rate this at 4 stars automatically then.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This is one of few albums I was anxiously awaiting to be released. It's a great recording-I have my favorites, but it's definately an album you can listen to from start to finish with complete satisfaction. It's nice for a band to consistently deliver great music and not dissapoint-can't wait to see them live.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|I only really like 3 TV shows on TV that I will not miss an episode of that is Suits, Burn Notice and Fringe. These 3 shows are so different and refreshing from anything else on TV I'm addicted.<br />I Love Suits this is one show that I can not take it or leave it like so many other shows.<br />Harvey and Mike make a great team together. This show is so different from any other Legal show that has ever been on TV I think anyone who watches it will be pleasantly surprised. This show makes you think and I can't get enough of it. I wish it was on all year because I'm tired of reruns I want to see the new stuff now.Harvey keeps saying he doesn't care about anyone but himself, but it is obvious that is not true.Mike already looks like he may end up being a better lawyer then Harvey and Harvey already  is a top flight Attorney in New York City.
