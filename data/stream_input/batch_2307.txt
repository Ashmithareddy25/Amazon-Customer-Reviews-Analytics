B007THA4FI|4.0|Don't look for an uplifting yarn and a triumph of good over evil.  Set in the small middle class village of Pagford and the nearby Fields public housing estate, this is a gritty exploration of the tensions between classes, generations, and neighbors.  Throw in some mental illness, family dysfunction, and drug addiction and...  well... you get the picture.  The character studies are brilliant.  I found myself rooting for some of the most flawed and broken personalities.  But these are generally people I am happy were confined to the book.  I'm not sure I'd want to invite any of them -- from Pagford or the Fields -- to dinner.  Perhaps that's the reaction and the attendant guilt Rowling is trying to trigger.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Daft Punk is so creative and this soundtrack is a great example about how expansive their skills are within music. It draws in more classical music in a trendy way that is lifted up by various techno sound effects. There are very few lyrics, so it's mainly one of those CDs you can daydream too and create your own personal imagery. Even if the CD gets scratched I will buy another one!

0547848412|5.0|This book is more macabre than I'd expected, yet I loved it.  Martel's writing is startling and enchanting, evoking both unsettling and wonderful images; and although the protagonist is a deeply spiritual animal lover, he is not without a certain amount of dark, refreshing humor.  I'm sad now, though, to have finished this book because I really miss the tiger.  Whether Richard Parker is actual or metaphorical, to be in the company of the 450-pound Bengal tiger whom Martel has brought to life is utterly enthralling!

B007N5YIUS|5.0|We love all Angry Birds' products in our house - and Angry Birds Space is no exception.  We did also pay up for the full version later, but this was a good start.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Me encanta como escribe Paulo Coelho y El Alquimista es uno de mis libros favoritos!  Lo recomendo para todos interesados en el significado de la vida.
1451627297|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but wanted to love it more than I did.  I have genuinely loved King's books, and my favorite all-time book is the original version of The Stand.  (later version with added pages was too bloated and overlong - yay, editors!)  But...... while the story is gripping and will hold your attention, the odd thing is that I expected this to be a different book than it was.  I never read the liner notes when I know I'm going to read a book no matter what, and in this case, I didn't.  But the book cover led me to believe that there would be more historical focus.  SPOILER/SPOILER/SPOILER:<br /><br />To cover the alternate history in a few paragraphs was a rip-off.  I knew from the beginning that the alternate history was going to be a disaster, and that the reboot would absolutely happen, wiping out the machinations of the entire book.  Still, I didn't expect such a short summary, given that the book cover made it seem like the alternate history would be more of a focus.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the book.  It just wasn't the book I thought it was.  The scenes with Sadie at the end were lovely.  I do recommend reading, but would change the book cover if I could.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love downton abbey! Cannot wait to watch third season! One of the best shows on tv!  Wish amazon had it already.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|and great customer service... easily addictive ...<br />and the sync with facebook is a plus<br />so you can share hi scores and trash talk
B002OSY2T6|3.0|I purchased this because of the great reviews I read. My son does seem to like it; however, it does not work as I expected. I thought it would move across the floor by itself, but it must be pushed by either parent or child. If you have carpet, it hardly moves at all, even after a good push. It is cute though. My son does like it but I expected a little more for the price.
B00821OX98|5.0|I watched episode 1 with skepticism.  &#34; War of the Worlds meets Independence Day&#34; is what I called it. As I watched the rest of the episodes, I found I was wrong. I like the post-apocalyptic/disaster journey sorts of tales and this one does a great job.The only other shows I can compare this too are &#34;The Stand&#34; and &#34;Jeremiah&#34;.  It's not really either, but some of the feel is there.  I love the cast--they all suit their parts so well. I have watched both seasons (and will rewatch them) and can't wait for Season 3.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever and one I watch every year during Holy Week.  I was worried that it might not arrive on time - but it did, and in excellent condition.  No problems!
B0035JRUZQ|4.0|Growing up in the 1950s and 60s, John Wayne was &#34;king&#34; of the male movie stars.  In El Dorado, he is teamed with another giant of the era, Robert Mitchum, the up-and-coming young actor James Caan, and character actors Arthur Honeycutt and Ed Asner, to produce a fun movie.  While the plot is typical (good guys vs bad guys) and very much like a previous Wayne classic, Rio Bravo, El Dorado is entertaining and fun to watch.  Over the past 40 years, we have been so bombarded by profanity and sexual situations on the big screen, it is fun to watch a movie where there is none of either.  You can watch it in complete comfort whether watching with your kids or your mother.  Is El Dorado the best film The Duke ever made?  No...but the mix of characters and a good plot combine to produce, what I like to call, &#34;a fun movie with a predictable outcome.&#34;  I would watch this movie anytime compared with the majority of junk that Hollywood produces today.
030758836X|1.0|The only winner here is the writer who thanks to all of us is making a fortune! Even though I read so many bad reviews I still read this book out of curiosity. It kept me interested, but the story is unbelievable and I mean it. And it is not only the end that is bad. After reading this book I feel disgusted. Please don't give any more money to this author. I will make sure I never read one of her books again. If this kind of book can do so well I will start writing myself!
0321714113|5.0|one of the best, clear statement, same as the old version  except  about some new features of c + +
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Realistic portrayal of an unassuming spouse as to her husband's true nature of deceit.<br />Quick court pace and cutting dialog excellently  written only furthers to enhance The Good Wife's appeal.<br />As well as somewhat scandalous relationships evolving amongst the cast make for a thrilling season.<br />A must see and refreshingly realistic.<br />A bold departure from typical prime time tv.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|Rose can get annoying but the show is fantastic. The special effects are perfectly cheesy and it's appropriate for most ages.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Using the Pro app on my iPhone and it works just fine.  However, it is pretty annoying process of their commercial breaks.  Cutting into the program, or air gaps.  But what is the biggest pain is listening to the same two commercials alternate as many as 10 times per hour.  I guess it would be okay if they were funny or talented spots, but they are just awful.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|A FUN little game, but harder than it looks.  I like that you can change the way you steer the buggy.  My kids really enjoy it.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Having been in the military for 23 years was very familiar with Seal Snipers and Special Operations Groups.  This book tells the story as it is. Sorry that Chris is gone, he was one of the good guys.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is as good as the original Percy Jackson series and a prefect continuation. I love how he switches point of view and the new character are a prefect addition to the series.
B007HGPBRC|2.0|the same kind my dad had....the reason for reading is... not very good - didn't learn anything i didn't know already.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It is a great book. Riordan is nothing short of brilliant. He draws you in with his quirky humor and gives you an adventure that rivals Harry Potter.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|enjoyed the characters, the town and the mystery surrounding the story.  got a little bored towards the end however...ending took too long.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the Percy Jackson series so when I heard that Rick Riordan was writing a sequel series I naturally had to check it out and WOW. it was awesome! I ended reading the first three books of The Heroes of Olympus series because I couldn't put them down in less than a week. Now I am patiently waiting for the fourth book to come out.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|enjoy this novel, I did.  I wish Amazon would bookmark where the end of the &#34;try a sample&#34; is, when you end up buying the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show.  I like that they are not afraid to kill off main characters in the series.  Other shows tend not till kill off characters so there is less suspense; you know they will come out okay no matter what.  Not in the Walking Dead!  Plus new characters keep it fresh.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|Not one I liked to young minded for me.  Thanks for lertting me try it.  Yours truely, Sheila A A

B005LAIII0|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this movie! Brilliant special effects and a compelling storyline make this a must have for any movie collector.  Ang Lee certainly deserved his Oscar for Directing this beautiful movie!
B005T87QCI|1.0|This is the single worst pile of crap I've ever seen call itself a game. I wish I could give it zero stars. This is a ripoff. Terrible graphics, moving and punching don't work, hundreds of bugs with the animations, and in-app purchases for EVERYTHING.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this movie! Brilliant, Broadway worthy acting and a compelling story line make this a must have for any movie collector.

B000PC0U1W|5.0|I very much appreciate this movie in several ways.<br /><br />The actors do a very nice job and I really like the story line.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I read the book several years ago, and the movie stayed close to the book.  The acting is exceptional and keeps your attention throughout the movie.  Only problem I had was the stage play cut-outs; it made the viewer feel as if he is sitting in a theatre.  This portrayal of theatre scenes confused me.  Maybe there is something I do not understand about the way the director wanted the viewer to see the film.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|This is the season of ST:TNG when it all came together. Season two had some bucking and kicking, but in season three TNG went full throttle, became the best show on television, and never looked back.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|I loved this movie just as much as my kids. It has a good \\"moral to the story\\" all throughout it. Just really loved it. :)
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game has really good graphics for a $2 app. We have enjoyed playing this game. I'm not sure how many levels are avalible.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love these videos!  Each one shows a different aspect of life on this earth.  David Attenborough does a better job with the narration than Susan Sarandon because her voice is more monotone.  After each video (there are 3 per CD), be sure to watch the Planet Earth Diaries.  They show how the photographers got the incredible

0345803485|2.0|The sex scenes were well-written, I'll give her that. But the rest of the story is poorly written with very little imagination. She keeps using the same lines and descriptions over and over, ad nauseum. You could seriously have a drinking game over the line: &#34;His lips pressed into a hard line...&#34; (Take a drink everytime you read that line and you'll be drunk by the end of one chapter) Was it worth wading through all of that repetition for a handful of well-written sex scenes? Barely...<br />Wouldn't it be nice to read a book where both the story and the sex scenes were well-written?

B003O86FMW|4.0|Very good follow up to Hunger Games. Sets up the final book in the series very well. I can't wait to read Mockingjays.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|this was for my nook and i have always wanted to read the novel.  i didn't want to base my knowledge on the 20th& 21st century movies.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is by far the best tv adaptation of a book series I have ever seen.  The characters are so well done and expertly cast (especially Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister!), the special effects are tasteful and not cheesy, and even the scene transitions match the mood and setup of the books.  Way to go, George R. R. Martin and HBO!!!  Can't wait for Season 3!!<br /><br />Also, the special features on the Blu-ray set are the most intuitive and helpful I've ever seen.  Having an interactive sidebar where you can pause the show at any moment and get a reminder of who the characters are in this scene, where it takes place and especially the little extra scenes you can listen to giving more background information on the locations and characters if you choose, is extraordinary!  What a great idea to add to this series in particular, which has so many characters and locations that it is difficult to keep track.  Genius.<br /><br />I can't believe I got the blu-ray, DVD, *and* the Digital Download copy for such a great price!  1/3 of what I would have paid anywhere else for just one of those things.  Amazon, you rock.  I don't know why I ever shopped anywhere else.  Also, great shipping times!
0525953728|5.0|Great Book!  Give a very detailed description of the mission and mission planning.  If you are looking for a detailed read of how a SEAL progresses through his career all the way to ST-6 then this is a good read.  I can highly recommend this as a retired 22yr Special Operator!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented this movie to see if it was any good ,before I would consider buying it.  My family and I enjoyed it very much.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was an excellent read with the novel approach and the 'can't put it down' content.  It is one of my favorite books this year.  I have recommended it to a lot of people.
B0098VXMNE|3.0|The second season of Spartacus doesn't live up to the standards of season one.  Not as good without Andy Whitfield.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly is an excellent writer.  Not as good on this one as some of his stories.  I like the hint that Bosch will get romantically involved in a future book.  Having lived for 30 years in the LA area makes the reference to landmarks a good tie in for me,<br /><br />Wambaugh is another LA writer that I particularly enjoy.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Excelente producto estoy muy contento con el resultado. no tengo ninguna queja perfectas condiciones y buen desempeño. recomiendo éste artículo
B009U9S6FI|4.0|I would have loved it if I could understand more of it.  It makes you want to find someone to discuss almost every page.  There are an unlimited number of questions and answers in each part of the book. Not an easy read but got engrossed in every part.<br /><br />Frankl was an amazing man and I'm going to see if I can find some one who speaks Logotherapy.<br /><br />One of my all time favorite books is &#34;The Last Freedom&#34; by Mike Ryan.  We were fortunate to have Mr. Ryan to sit in our discussion of Mike's book.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|An excelllent and suspensful read. This book provided fascinating insight into fear, domestic violence and OCD. I haven't read a book this fast in a very long time.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good syfy . A little over simplified but fun. Worth reading good plot turns. I would like to see the series continued.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This is one of the cuter movies that Hollywood has come out with for kids in a while, my whole family loves it!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Its a great app. You can download from standard definition to 1080p.<br /><br />Only one complaint. When I'm using the stock YouTube app and I hit share and press tune mate icon why can't it just use a pop up window for download quality's instead of launching the app? Just wish I can download the video straight from the YouTube app instead of having to have to open Tubemate to do it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you  missed this in theaters, then I feel bad for you. However, this is still fantastic even on the &#34;small screen&#34;. I think one of the things that I love so much about this is that because Peter Jackson is the director (I panicked for a bit there when he supposedly wasn't going to do it) the feel of the movie is consistent with the LOTR trilogy he did. Beautiful scenery, great actors, and all that good stuff abound. Definitely worth a watch.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Overall good movie. Just didn't understand the concept. They say even though drunk & high no one could of landed that plane the way he did. Not sure what he even did wrong cause they never showed that he did anything wrong. They even found faults with plane. So not sure what they were trying to deliver in their message
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was just little. Full of fantasy, comedy, romance and action, there's a little something for everyone. If you haven't seen, I recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show.... good price... downloaded right to the kindle would definitely grab seasons for the kindle again for other series as well.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I enjoyed this movie . It is a good get away from it all movie Milla dose it for me ,style wise
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I expected this to be your average romance. The one where the girl falls in love  with a guy and they live happily ever after. This may be a romance but there is so much more to it. I didn't even expect this!! Colleen Hoover is a great author.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie I am a bond fan , so I was please with the blue ray edition . Clear  showing and great sound

B007ZGBZHE|2.0|First, if you're not a fan of the Pendergast novels, don't even think of buying this; you have no chance of following it.<br /><br />If you are, you're in for another dose of mediocre writing, only now the plotting has reached unfathomable extremes, as Pendergast morphs from an extremely knowledgable and clever Holmsian detective into a near comic book superhero who, as such heroes are these day, seems to have both extraordinary powers and bouts of depression.  Graves and Preston also weave in subplots concerning two other recurring characters, neither of which seem to have much to do with what's going on with Agent Pendergast.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was like a better version of Bring It On. Being in high school choir competitions made this really relateable.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Hardly a boring moment a great Science Fiction show. The writers are very creative and what will they think of next!
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Every high school coach needs to read this.  I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did, but the author gave life to a fascinating view of baseball and it's players and management. Some were things I had heard my husband say over the years, a true lover of baseball strategy, as well as a player through college.  You have to admire Mr. Beane for his vision and persistence in achieving so much with so few monetary resources when compared to many teams in MLB.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|A great story that is very well done as a movie. I thought there would be more action and suspense; however, what was there was well done and kept me interested through the end.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The singing is fantastic.  I love the story.  Cher and Christina were terrific in this movie.  This is one I will watch many times.
B00AO686L0|5.0|two of my favorite actors..Al Pacino and Russell Crowe in fine form....an adult type movie in more about substance and story than explosions,car chases and special effects
B005DJRD80|1.0|Freeks and Geeks was much more entertaining than this trashy series. Is this typical of H.S. behavior, yeah right.  Only in some 40+ year old writer's head. Shame on them for trying to live out their unfulfilled H.S. fantasies in this series. It's moronic, trashy, and trashy.  Oh, did I say trashy yet? It's trashy.<br /><br />Bring back shows like Freeks and Geeks.  Now that is more like H.S. than this dumb show.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is awesome! I absolutely love the campaign and the multiplayer. The main problem that I have with it is that sometimes my money, xp, and attachments won't save. But other than that, this game is definately worth the money.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This movie very predictable. I thought it was boring, there were no surprises, no twists, nothing that kept one on edge. The movie is as Simon would say &#34;forgettable&#34;. If anyone in a year will talk about this movie to me, I won't remember it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|A collection of movies that cover a history of  one most famous fictional families in U.S. crime history. A worthy set of movies for anyone's collection of some of the highest rated movies in Hollywood history.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|awesome movie on blu-ray great cost but would have much prefered the director's  uncut versin on blu-ray . soud quality excellent.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I loved the story. It was first and foremost a romance, and what a treat it was to find such a thoroughly likable heroine. Honoria was everything a heroine should be: strong, smart, resourceful, courageous and loyal. The hero Blade was my favorite sort; his rogue blue blood status placed him firmly in gamma hero territory and it didn't hurt that he was just the right amount of menacing, jealous and possessive. But then like a breath of fresh air, it turns out he is also emotionally stable - well accept for when the bloodlust flares up and his eyes turn black; but other than that he's in touch with his emotions and able to express them appropriately. He's also incredibly decent. The paranormal elements add an interesting story to the mix, and the take on vampirism is quite original. I've never read any steampunk before; but here it doesn't seem to serve any purpose other than lending a little extra atmosphere to the backdrop for the story. I loved it so much that I will probably read the sequel even though I'm not overly interested in Will and Lena's story
B0024F08UG|5.0|this is Great movie for those who like irwin alllen movies nice collectable great effects for its time. old school fire fighting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love how original this book is. It its wonderfully written and a overall excellent story. I've read it four times and every time it blows me away. Katniss Everdeen is the perfect heroine. I don't think I'll ever be able to get enough of this book or the series.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small and light but gets the job done on my smooth and serrated knives. I would definitely recommend. Good job Smith's!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this book. It is amazing. As soon as I finished it, i was kinda sad because I knew it was the end of the series, but happy because it was truly a work of art. Suzanne Collins made a heck of a book and it was a perfect way to end the Hunger Games series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app does exactly what I need. It is an alarm clock that actually works. You can set alarms for multiple times, on different schedules, etc. I currently set my alarm according to my work week and set a separate alarm for my weekend activities.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|_this game is super cute its a little glitchy but all in all its fun.u should definently get this app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my kids like to play it a lot and where very excited when we downloaded it on our tablets.  it had been about a month and are still going strong with it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a great book that really makes the reader ponder the differences amongst people. It should be required reading for every middle school student. Because it is told from various perspectives, the reader gains insight into many different characters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Nicholas Sparks will not be happy till he makes you cry. Haha. Definitely read it before you see the movie.
0316044695|5.0|This author can place you there in the situation.  You will feel like you are there right with him in all he does.
B006WQLH7G|2.0|In order to download this application you have to jailbreak your kindle which messes up your warranty so I was not going to take that chance and couldn't use it.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love PINK! She is such a great artist. Love love love love love love love love love her so much!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I got hooked on this show again after watching the first season. Still enjoy it and have watched all seasons now. Helps that you watch them all together without commercial interruptions and a six month wait between seasons.
B008J34466|5.0|I love this album. Great songs, great lyrics and Pink well amazingly talented and someone who takes no guff from anyone!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Awesome it is a great book and has some bad words but it still rocks and has none-stop action that will make your shackles rise
B004GXHOGK|5.0|This is one of my favorite animals in the collection and the fox is nicely detailed and posed pretty realistically.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the most frightening game ever. The day I got it I couldn't stop playing even though I almost cried when he came around one of the trucks with his tentacles and scared me to death. GET THIS GAME. It's awesome, scary and just plain fun. There are two maps right now the farm and road. Just saying don't put the fog on you'll regret it.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|I love the series ... First book is the best as usual ... But the story is exciting and you just can't stop reading
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Some graphic scenes dealing with torture, but extremely well acted and the story, even though we all know the ending is good.  It should be noted that the scenes I didn't like, as a woman, my male colleagues loved.  So there is something for everyone.
B001KR9AP8|5.0|Absolutely Love It, would recommend it to anyone that loves R&B and great diva voices!  Please go and buy it!
1613823649|1.0|I approached this book with high hopes.  I love good apologetics and was hoping for some reason, faith, and spirituality.  This is my first exposure to Chesterton.  I'm sure he's a fine writer.  But for this particular book the writing is undisciplined and meandering.  It reads like it was written in a late night caffeine binge and submitted without the benefit of an editor.  I don't doubt Chesterton's genius; this book is not an example.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I loved both snarkbusters from this developer so I had no problem purchasing the full version. excellent amount of game time!!! so worth it! the graphics puzzles ho and adventure are all awesome and work fine on my kindle fire. kudos for alawar
B00BF11STU|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but somewhat disappointed in how the story was told.  Seemed tedious when it wasn't needed and brief when more background information was needed.  I was extremely disappointed in the raid scences that were so dark you couldn't tell what was going on.  Maybe in a theatre the images would have been more clear but there were times in the movie when I had no clue what they were doing just because I couldn't see anything in the darkness - maybe that is more realistic to what really happens but it's a movie - a visual medium - you need to see what is going on.  Glad I rented rather than purchase
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Playing as one player,against the computer, is very challenging.  Putting the &#34;computer&#34; into check is AWESOME !!  ...it doesn't last long and I haven't won a game yet but I keep coming back for more !
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|I just converted 13 wma files to Mp 3 for use on my Kindle Fire HP. Conversion went fairly fast but would appreciate app remembering source folder.
B00BLGZN1S|1.0|I am extremely disatisfied with Amazon prime because it will not allow me to show movies on my TV.<br />I would like to cancel Amazon Prime and recieve a refund.
B008D36INE|3.0|You won't be surprised by anything or any character . Rachel Weisz does a good job at playing distraught wife and lover

B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I don't buy a lot of CDs anymore ... will always by Boz's new releases. I am always happy when I'm listening to Boz Scaggs.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I so loved this book!!! I seriously could not but it down.  I would  absolutely recommend this book to anyone.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|\\"Plodding\\" is how I'd describe book 5. Totally lacking the pace an  punch of the initial book. Still, couldn't put it down since I'm so invested in his brilliant characters.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This Movie was very cute.  I watched it with my 4 & 6 year olds and we all loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love. this. show.<br />scares the crap out of my gal, but we're both still addicted.<br />with all the twists and turns, I'm sure it will get lost at some point, but so far, it just keeps you guessing.<br />they are definitely not afraid to kill of major characters and introduce vast new plot lines.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Hard work, diligence and love of what you do pays off, and this album is stunningly beautiful.  I found these guys while watching some Lindsey Stirling videos on YouTube and watched and listened to all that they have online.  I was amazed at their talent and the joy just watching them perform for they were having great fun performing. The videos are amazing but their music is really dynamic.  The mix of classical with pop and the unusual mix of piano. cello and acoustics is full of beauty. The way the young talent is mixing different music genres is terrific.  Gentlemen, keep on bringing the music in album form and video.  How about doing some concerts in the Nations Capital area..........
0307887960|4.0|The book was written so that you don't need to read the entire book to start the diet.  Also, you can easily find the section of the diet that pertains to you.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I first saw her on America's got Talent and she was stunning.  What she has done and where she has gone since AGT is just amazing.  This young woman is so talented there are not enough words to express.  Her command of her violin and what she can do with it is dynamic. I heard her again on Pandora and on YouTube--her videos are superb. quirky and beautiful. a mix of ethereal beauty. I love her style and I love her music and interpretation. Looking forward to more and more from her.  I also came upon The Piano Guys on YouTube and got their album-they are something really special as a team and separately and they do amazing things with sound and traditional classical instruments. Then, I found David Garrett on Pandora and between Lindsay, Piano Guys and David Garrett I really have heaven on earth. David Garrett of course is the ultimate classical violinist and is a virtuoso. All these young talented people are classical violinsts. pianist and cellist, but what they can do with their instruments is magnicent. I love classical music and opera and love to hear David Garrett do strictly classical, and would love to hear Lindsay do some straight classical.
0307744434|4.0|Once my rational self stopped trying to place everything in its logical corner, I was able to relax into the murky swirling magic this book had to offer. The premise was fabulous. Otherworldly people (with a mystical, competitive agenda that drove the plot)entertaining ordinary people in a black and white, peculiar-but-enchanting circus milieu. A circus appears out of nowhere, over and over, place after place,and always draws a throng. No advertising necessary. Deliciously creepy. I wanted to read more.
B002ZG97RY|5.0|Got this item super quick Im very satisfied with the product.would recomend this to anyone.  Great packaging also good work
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I had 48 hrs to watch this movie and the sequel. But for some reason it kept pausing and pausing and it got stuck and it was long pauses like 5 minutes and then it would start and pause after a few minutes. If I can figure out I would like to get a refund or a re rental. Other than that the movie was very graphic as far the joker but the concept was good.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I often need to check work emails while I am away from my home...and this lets me check proofs etc.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It took me two days to be able to watch it because it kept pausing.  I would like a refund or a re rental.  I finally made it to the ending but it took several tries so i am not sure how it really ended.  Overall i did like it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I think I had high expectations but upon review of that statement, really not sure what \\"high\\" meant!!! Of course: Lewis, Lincoln, Speilberg, +, +. And all the acting is superb. And the settings, rich, detailed. And the story movies along, well paced, even, BUT for some reason, \\"ho hum\\"???? I am not sure why!! Lewis does a good job but his character in some many others (Gangs of New York, There Will Be Blood...) were all superior to his effort in this one. I am not saying it a terrible film, just not the best of the best!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I have been converted to a S.O.A. fan. Great show so far(I'm in the middle of 2nd season). Great characters, lots of storylines to keep you hooked. People have been 'pushing' me to watch this for years, and I resisted. Finally got PRIME for Christmas and thought 'what the heck'. I am under 'Charming's' spell and a 'lifer'(show references, sorry). Highly recommend if you are fans of 'The Shield', '24', 'Homeland', or even 'True Blood' and 'G.O.T.' It has plenty of twists, shocking revelations, and as much language and T&A that FX could get away with(can't imagine what this would have looked and sounded like on HBO or Showtime!)<br />Anyway, check it out for yourself if you have not already and get ready for a 'Patchover'(you'll see).
B0015XASFS|3.0|I have other CDs by Josh Grogan that I like much better - this one was a bit of a dissapointment.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I'm doing this review for my wife(she just doesn't like reviewing things). The show is not quite my speed, but my wife is absolutely hooked. She is the biggest 'X-Files' fan you'll ever meet(she has the complete series, movies, action figures, autographs ...) Anyway, the point is I have not seen her this hooked on a show since then, and she is totally hooked on 'Fringe'. She even has my 12yr. old son watching it now! that's how I know it's good. I have to confess I have only seen a couple of episodes myself, but they seem very well written, acted, directed, and 'special effects' are excellent. My wife has watched all 4 seasons on Prime and is considering purchasing the 5th because she has no patience(Amazon please release 5th season soon!). I think I have convinced her to 're-watch' all 4 seasons in order again, but I don't know how much longer that will last. Hope this review helped in the slightest. Bottom line: Most X-Files fans and Sci-Fi fans in general will get a kick out of FRINGE. Enjoy!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is the B-E-S-T! OMG! I just can't stop playing this game, it work well on my kindle.<br />I had no problems downloading it!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Similar to reading &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34;, a disturbing read about a very dysfunctional family. Perhaps the movie is better.  I had to force myself to finish it.  I did not recommend to my friends.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This movie is a powerful and beautiful work of art. The music and acting make this so believable and passionate. The work put in by the actors is obvious and the classic story make the length of this movie go practically unnoticed. Pay attention! It is easy to lose track of the story if you miss anything. You can read other product reviews by me on my blog at [...].
B001LX2J22|5.0|Not for everyone but certainly for the likes of me and mine. Tens for writing, directing acting and cardiac response.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game for the price! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing hidden object games. Graphics are good as well &amp; like the zoom option
B0091REZMW|5.0|Wonderful gave I love it.  It has so many different quests to keep you interested and continually gives you new things.  After playing game for 1&amp; half yrs I truelly enjoy it. What I don't is all the problems I have had with the game loading and freezing and the help you don't receive from GI. To add to that gi has recently helped me restore my game, even tho it was their issues that caused it to be deleted.
0142418471|5.0|I bought Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green and David Leviathan and, I am writing an honest review.<br /><br />Before opening this book I was a bit confused as to what the story was actually about, now that I'm finished I'm still kind of confused as to what the story was about because there seemed to be a few meanings to it, but either way I loved it! In the first two chapters we meet Will Grayson and will grayson, two very different guys living in two very different worlds. The book is basically about a certain time in both boys lives I guess you would say and we get to learn quite a bit about them, and see some struggles they go through.<br /><br />First we meet Will Grayson and his best friend Tiny (whom is the best gay person I've ever met! That's not a spoiler don't worry.) The thing about Will, and Tiny is that they have been friends since they were little but they seem to be the kind of best friends (at times) that are drifting apart when they are older. Will is a great character even though he is one of those people who aren't very proactive he doesn't stick up for himself, and basically lets people especially his friends sort of walk all over him. Tiny is the complete opposite he's the kind of guy who doesn't care what people think of him he's always talking and always very cheerful which is one of the things that made me love him!<br /><br />Then we meet will grayson and his friend Maura. These were the chapters that were depressing so it kind of balanced out the book. You went from happy cheerful chapters to the depressing I don't know what to do with myself chapters. will grayson is a very depressed person from the very beginning we find out that he himself is gay and I do think that this has to do with his being so depressed, at first I don't really think he wants people to look at him differently. Now on to his \\"friend\\" Maura, when we first meet her I didn't have an issue with her she seemed like an okay friend that was treated like crap by her best friend. I can't say too much because there will be major spoilers so all I can say is she didn't turn out the way I pictured.<br /><br />One thing I didn't completely enjoy about the book was that I honestly in the end don't know what the book was about. Yes there were a few lessons learned and things like that but I still am not clear on what it was about maybe that was the point? Overall though the book gets a 5 out of 5 stars because it was still AMAZING!est friend.

B006RXQ3T6|3.0|Full of classic, quoteable cartoony moments. Interesting concept. Moves a little slow for me. My spouse thinks its a five star.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|it have been around 17 yrs when my mom and I watched this move she was up already i joined her we started watching a old movie and loved every minute of it by the end we knew we wanted to own it and since then i had been looking for it toughest part was that we didnt know the name of the movie, but it was well worth the wait and memories just flowed when we watched it again<br />A BIG THANK YOU from my mom and I
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Transforms the viewer back in time when civil rights were still evolving. The actresses deserve much credit for their passionate depiction.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|A lot of work but its worth the wait and fun.Right.  people?  I play all  it day.That's how fun it is!
B006R1T40I|3.0|I purchased this CD based on reviews of others and was a little disappointed.  I wouldn't say it was her best.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best dramas that really knows how to constantly raise the stakes and keep the viewer engaged. Watch it!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Unfortunately I found the majority of it all sounded the same. Next time, I would consider just ordering one song instead of the whole compilation.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I am a special education teacher.  I appreciate Daniel Pink dedicating attention to the Ed-Med.  My wife is a nurse.  I have read all his books and have incorporated them in both my professional and personal life.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I love this CD.  Unfortunately the radio has overplayed some of the tunes.  Overall, it is a great piece of work and nice to listen to as a whole.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|dont get me wrong I love the game but hate the launch the game is fun but launch is super super slow
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An amazing book about love and brutality brought on by the capital.<br />If your looking for a good book this is it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Awesome game. took forever to download but worth it! I don't think I'll ever get tired of playing it and you don't have to spend money ifyou don't want to.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have read other novels by Sparks and have always liked his style.  He is easy to read and keeps you glued to his subject.  I didn't realize it was going to be about a battered woman.  Appears this is a new hot spot in storylines.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Perfect Sci-Fi action movie with a lot of heart. I've always been a fan of Bruce Willis. And now Joseph Gordon-Levitt is newly added to my list. Emily Blunt adds the finishing touch along with Pierce Gagnon who plays her son. The conflicts of past and future self presented by Bruce and Joseph and the moral undertones apparent in their interactions with Emily and Pierce make this a philosophical tale of the human condition as well as a great time travel Sci-Fi movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|It took a little while to get through all three books, but I am now finished and loved the way it all turned out!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have managed to complete all 3 seasons in about 2 weeks. Totally addicting, wonderfully written, and brilliantly done by all involved!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The story was very interesting and the personal relationship between his wife and him sounded true to life.  The battle field scenes were exciting.  The book was impersonal and have been real.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|In the Kindle version of this book, it'd be nice to have quick links to each of the exercises for reference during workouts.<br /><br />From your level of strength to getting much stronger, the knowledge given and the routines show definitely help in strengthening your muscles. The science and medicine behind the techniques is important to me. The author didn't skimp on those. After reading the book for the how and why, going back to it for continued training reference is quite useful.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I wanted to see this because of the brilliant cinematography. And it was!  I highly recommend this movie to all.
B0018RC7QE|3.0|The acting in this movie is not the best; I have seen Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro perform much better.
B004XISI4A|5.0|What can one say about this series...  when will the next book come out!<br /><br />Action packed, family blood feuds, fantasy it's got it all. Never a dull moment with this series.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely the best show I have watched in years.  Take time to catch up on the older seasons before season 4 airs later this year/next year.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I downloaded the whole series 7 books so far cannot wait for the next to come out! Took me months to read but worth it! Hung on every word and every adventure the story lead me into!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I received it in good  time, was shipped in good packaging, was great quality, my son loved it, I recommend this site again for ordering.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|Love Garth's music. Some songs are obviously fill ins, but overall a very good CD. I would recommend this to my friends.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Every episode and every season just keeps adding to the greatness and quality.  It is such an epic and marvelous journey that you never want it to end.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is my favorite author. I have read most of his books and have never been disappointed. He puts a twist on the world of law and lawyers that no one else can.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This show always get me.  They always have amazing plots,worlds, creatures and wildlife that add such a vibrant dimension to the already amazing stories.
B008BD9SI8|2.0|Joe Abercrombie frustrates me: he is definitely a great writer who can not only draw up a new fantasy universe that is quite close to humanity's own history, he is also very good in connecting it to various individual fates to make the reader care.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, a couple of books ago, he started to overdo descriptions of the bleakness and grittiness of his scenarios. Every single character is angry and beaten down by fate. Every sentence that is being uttered by one of the characters is followed by some depressing one-liner that puts them down. Every 'hero' in the story is the kind of person who is extremely torn up by what has happened to them... and that is not only repeated from person to person, but also from fight to fight. When put together, this makes for very repetitive and therefore boring reading. After about 50 pages, I caught myself jumping sentences of self-pity and regret, and after 100 pages, I was already jumping whole paragraphs. It's almost as if at some point an editor told the author \\"Your readers love it when you put down your heroes, so write more of that\\" and so he made that the centrepiece of his books.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Red Country\\" is pretty weak - it's a standard yarn of revenge, finding the ones who did something bad and then kill everybody who gets in the way. A few well-known characters from former books have their cameos, but once again, I was left feeling that they were much better in the first few books than they were now.<br /><br />I know that Joe Abercrombie fans will buy this book, no matter what I say. However, if you were undecided about it, I would say leave this one out, it's pretty forgettable. And I personally can only hope that Abercrombie puts a little more effort into the next one.<br /><br />Oh, and some Kindle-specific feedback: the formatting of this one is terribly done. Sentences and paragraphs end all over the place, it's really annoying, probably the worst job I've seen so far turning a book intoan epub.
B006C1DH92|3.0|This game is a bit difficult for my 4-year-olds to get, and there really is no point to it other than to slash fruit (seems a bit violent at that), however I enjoy playing it for a minute, but really no longer than that.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is so much fun I can't put it down. I don't know if it's more fun because I don't drive or because I can crash and not get hurt. But either way I'm hooked.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better.  The ending.....never saw it coming!!!  Great story line, great acting, wonderful deep characters.....love every second of it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a great game - my daughter plays it all the time. she likes to collect all the pets and feed them
B001D0BLTA|4.0|I am probably alone in liking \\"Pretty in Pink\\" better than \\"Sixteen Candles\\" or \\"The Breakfast Club\\".  I liked the characters a great deal, and thought the cast was superb.  It's hard for me to pick out my favorite performance in this ensemble cast -- they all work so well together, and some of the supporting roles are better than the two headliners, Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy.  The other main character, Jon Cryer as the doormat boyfriend-wannabe Duckie, is charming, funny, and for me, a total heart-melter.<br /><br />Andi (Molly Ringwald) falls for Blaine (\\"That's not a name, that's a major appliance,\\" says Duckie in one of many memorable one-liners), played charmingly by Andrew McCarthy.  It's the classic tale of the rich guy/girl and poor guy/girl falling in love and finding more obstacles against their relationship than they could have even imagined.  Nothing new here, but again, the performances, the music, the great 80's fashions, and the catchy dialogue make it far more interesting than it could have been.<br /><br />James Spader is deliciously detestable as McCarthy's best rich pal/enemy (how could Blaine not have seen what was driving his venom?), Harry Dean Stanton gives nuance as Andi's hopelessly heartbroken father, and Annie Potts just about steals the show as Andi's pretty older co-worker, wisecracking friend.  I was enjoying the movie shamelessly, then was so disappointed in the predictably easy, feel-good ending.  The writers, producers, and director all took the easy way out, and who can blame them?  They are in it to make money, not art.  It would have been better as a thoughtful indie movie with a more realistic ending, but then they probably couldn't have gotten all those A-list brat pack actors.  Such is life, and Hollywood.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm not going to repeat what a whole bunch of people have already written about this mouse.<br />I'm breaking mine in on Crysis 3 and for those of you who are familiar with all of the on-the-fly<br />combat option in that game, let me just say this mouse is up to the task.  Buy it.  No other mouse<br />comes close at that price point.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I found the plot shallow, the acting only somewhat better, and the exposition and pacing to be rushed and jarring. I don't care for purposefully confusing scenes like the opening scene which is not explained until later. I didn't think the villain was particularly all that interesting although Daniel Craig does grow on you as Bond after a while and Judi Dench, while maybe not as great as she was in Pierce Brosnan's films, was also good.<br /><br />While this is better than his last outing, I think this Bond ranks down there with View to a Kill, Die Another Day, The World is Not Enough, and Diamonds are Forever.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I purchased the CD Some Nights by Fun, for just the title track -love that song -  and was pleasantly surprised at all the great songs on it! Buy it its gonna be a favorite of yours too!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a fast mahjong. I can play it anywhere, anytime. Easy to see. No irritating music. I play it clear my mind.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Lots of fun, great graphics and feel.  Very addictive to play.  Definitely try this one especially since it is free.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|What can you say about a dictionary. It comes in handy when I play word games and need to spell. So get this app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is worth the read.<br />Well paced, well written, challenging and not predictable!<br />It was hard to put down after getting into it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Good alarm clock app. Several customizable features. I like the ease of using multiple alarms. At first I thought the music with fade option too quiet but I love it now. I am now used to it and wake up without being startled at a low enough volume no one elsr wakes up.
1932100660|5.0|I am reading this book and it is changing my whole way of thinking!!  I am already a pescetarian and now I am considering becoming a vegan!  If more Americans read this, we wouldn't be the fattest nation in the world!!!
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|Been a fan since I was 8 years old.  Seen them in concert 12 times.  I love every album.  Simply awesome.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This was a happy accident for me.  Although not my typical genre choice I ended up loving this series. The writing and acting are solid.  I love that the writers do not take the easy way out, and there are plenty twists and turns that make the story engrossing.
B005DJREJS|3.0|I really like the show, but it was interrupted at least once an episode, and sometimes the connection was crap. It was okay.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I love this series. It is very entertaining and the development of the characters has me addicted. thanks Amazon, for having this available on Prime.
B00BF11STU|3.0|overrated expected more, the movie was a great story but too slow at points, worth watching but don't expect it to be great
B0098VXDDS|4.0|The second series is as great as the first. Again the men are gorgeous (women too). Can't  wait for the next series. I'm spellbound.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a fun game.... I have played it now for three days, but I can see it getting boring soon. Have fun...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good surprises this season and lots of the same old witty humor and lovable characters. Worth the money to own it.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|He is such a talented person. Love this album.  Great variety. My favorite song is mirrors. I would highly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Simply my favorite book in the entire world. Perfect for people ages 10 and up. I only recommend this book to people who can handle extreme and intense situations.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|awesome and great game. loved the movie and now I like the game. I recommend it all those who liked the movie and who like dinosaurs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A truly extraordinary book with strong power and emotions. Perfectly written. My thanks to Suzanne Collins for writing it. It ties the entire trilogy together.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great case for an iphone. Put on the screen protector and the case and your phone is protected. The case sticks out a tiny bit in the front so if you drop it and it lands on the front, the screen isn't really touching the ground. I've dropped my phone a few times and nothing was damaged. I like that you can see the Apple symbol in the center of the circles. It's cute.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|I have not used this app so I can not really review it well till I play it more than zero
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|This movie was terrible it was all over the place. They just kept repeating lines over and over. I love all the other die hards but this one sucked and i do not want to watch it again. It could of been alot better the last one was way better. All i kept hearing was that he was on vacation and that he has a son and he is the father over and over. Watch the other die hards instead.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is just like what I have on my wifes laptop and it rules when I want to know the weather I go there
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Interesting plot and character development, and the topic is<br />timely as we come more frequently into contact with so many<br />suddenly less-abled people. I can't argue with<br />the protagonist's decision, though I suspect others might feel<br />differently.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have all kinds of problems with app on my tablet not sure if it is/something I did or not
B002RUA54W|3.0|This was read by a character in another book I read that liked a lot<br />so decided to give it a try. Well-written, but all the characters seem<br />so shallow.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game very fun and addicting, I've got my whole family playing it :)<br />I really think its worth the money!
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Interesting depiction of real-life occupants of North Korea and<br />their often difficult transition to democratic existence in the South.<br />The leadership is cult-like.
0345803507|4.0|Like my other books - got started, then sidetracked and haven't completed even the 1st book yet - but plan to. Got it based on the attention book received, interesting read.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I love this movie version of Pride and Prejudice adapted from the Jane Austin novel. The acting is superb and the scenes are absolutely breathtaking! Recommended for the whole family!
B000002O4X|5.0|This was well worth the price, as it is an incredible musical portrayal of a world long gone. Africa in the 20s and 30s was as different as the moon. And yet the europeans came and lived there.<br /><br />torn apart by expansions of wars that were not theirs, and a nationalism that was too long submerged, these places and days will never be seen again.<br /><br />It was wonderful to see the images once.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This was a perfect adaption of the Jane Austin story. Beautiful cinematography and wonderfully portrayed! I would reccomend this whole family viewing...nothing inappropriate for young viewers.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Fast paced action story. Enjoyed the characters. A typical Lee Childs read. Left me looking forward to reading the next in the series.
B003B02O14|5.0|This story pulls the reader in from the opening paragraph and gradually unfolds layers upon layers of meticulous details and twists
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so much fun to play with. It is so addicting and easy to lose track time. New most played game.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Like many of you, when I listened to the first single, \\"Heaven\\", I was underwhelmed.  Thankfully, there are much better tracks on Delta Machine, and \\"Heaven\\" gets better when put in context with the rest of the album.  I wouldn't file this with \\"Exciter\\", but its hard for me rank it alongside any of their other pre-2000 albums.  I rank it above \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" because it is a more cohesive album, with a consistent mood and thematic material (SOU was good but all over the place, like a sampler plate).  I would rank it at or maybe higher than all of DM\\"s post 2000 material, but I won't even compare it to SOFAD, Ultra, Violator, Black Celebration, or MFTM because those are all classics that can never be touched by anything.  So in conclusion, it feels more like an album and less like an experiment for the first time since Ultra, but PTA had so many great singles its hard to put it much above that...you get the idea, get it if you're a DM fan.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I cannot play past world two!  The start of the first level of word three has a glitch and automatically drops the guy off a cliff.  There is nothing you can do to proceed from there!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It is a lot of fun, but be careful.  You can easily spend more time playing than you mean to do.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Received as ordered and quickly. I love the Moody Blues and was thrilled to have a new CD by Justin. Thank you
B0063GORYU|2.0|It has too many advertisements!  You have to stop and get out of the advertisements every time you start a new round.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|We loved this movie so much, we watched it twice already!  Great story and fun for the whole family to watch together.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Several times it freezes up during a round.  I loose my bingos and have to exit out.  I do not like how it will not let you earn additional coins unless you want to bug everyone and send requests
1400067820|2.0|I have read so many good books recommended by Amazon that I did not bother to investigate<br />whether or not I would appreciate Antifragile. The title intrigued me, and I assumed<br />I was purchasing an interesting scientific read that would offer insight and coverage into a new paradigm.<br />And to a slight extent, this book did deliver on my expectations, but those parts where I felt I was being engaged in<br />learning something new and groundbreaking comprised perhaps 20% of the book. Unfortunately, this 20% is scattered through<br />several chapters that read more like unfocused essays. Throughout, the author does make some interesting points and insights, but<br />unfortunately these are outweighed by an overall negative \\"I'm way cool and OK, and they are not\\" attitude that is mixed with superficial half-truths on just about anything that pique's his fancy when he feels those moments of inspiration to write.<br /><br />Perhaps the only part of the book that came close to meeting my expectations occurred in a later chapter where he explains<br />Jensen's Inequality, which states that, for a convex function f and random variable T, f(E[T]) &lt;= E[f(T)]. For example (and<br />this is my example, which I find more realistic than what the author offered since I've actually experienced it)<br />suppose that each day you arrive at a bus stop 10 minutes before the hour, in order to catch a bus that arrives on the hour.<br />If the bus arrives early, then your level of happiness is high, since you'll get to work early. On the other hand,<br />should the bus arrive late, it gives you a chance to talk with your best friend who happens to pass the stop a few minutes<br />after the hour on his daily walk. These talks always boost your morning happiness. Letting f measure your happiness as a function<br />of the time when the bus arrives, we see that f is convex, since its graph has a happy-face shape. Hence we would call you<br />\\"anti-fragile\\" with respect to the time at which your bus arrives. Indeed, the average arrival time T for the bus is on<br />the hour, a time that brings you the least happiness (you don't get to talk with your friend, and you may or may not arrive to work on time). But by Jensen's Inequality, we have E[f(T)] >= f(E[T]), which is<br />to say that your expected happiness under changes (i.e. disorder) will exceed the happiness you would expect under no disorder<br />(say if the bus arrived on time each day).<br /><br />The above paragraph reflects the only passage of the book that I found to represent \\"knowledge\\". Certainly, the amount of<br />grandstanding, peacocking, and \\"I'm OK they're not OK\\" ranting far outweighs the knowledge content.<br /><br />The author calls Jensen's Inequality his \\"Philosopher's Stone\\". I don't quite agree with that, but I do like the idea of trying to see the good in the inevitable changes that take place in our lives, regardless of cause. And yes, today I feel very happy about the non-random event of changing from this book to another!which your bus arrives.

0143119680|5.0|Loved this book. I really liked all the unique qualities about it. I loved Diana and Matthew. So intelligent as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game has great graphics and is pretty realistic. It also gives you the option to buy your horse sets of tacks and buy more than one horse.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|An Awesome CD, good beats, great use of instruments and sound machines. No crusing great cd for the whole family.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Bought this because of the title, and thoroughly enjoyed the story.  Hurray for the misremembered man!  Another book on these characters please.
0061906220|5.0|My girlfriend read this to her class of toddlers and told me about it. As someone who is in their early 20's, even I find this book very catchy! If you can catch the attention of an adult, then you got my vote! I love the song Pete sings. It has a wonderful moral to the song and I will try to buy all the other Pete the Cat books so when I have kids, they will never miss out! This is a must-buy for anyone!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow i feel like a kid. Nothing much happens but i can't stop playing. My co-workers are sick of hearing about my horse. Need support group.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|Excellent performance by two outstanding young singers.  These two have a bright future.  I am really looking  formward to their next effort.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Not a bad little thriller. Has some really scary moments. Unusual twist on the exocism ritual, this one based on Hebrew ritual.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I love this movie.  It's a cartoon for thinking adults, with a great message, told in a funny and very touching way.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|What a snoozer!!!! Christiam Bale needs to take some voice lessons. What did he say??? Too Long Too Boring and  too dark, not the story, the production quality. And what's with that motorcycle, using catwoman's posterior as a rudder...
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|My kids have wanted to see this for a long time so I finally bought it and downloaded it on my kindle.  Its s amazing.  The kids are quiet when we are out - even the 2yr old  (I have 4 kids)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|All my gear fit perfectly in this bag with room to spare.  Very pleased with the interior padding.  Shoulder straps and back are well padded for comfort.  but the bag is smaller than it appears in the images, but still very satisfied.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was the best book by Sparks that I have read so far. The suspense was intense and the storyline is wonderful. I love Sparks` descriptive writing, it brings my imagination to life. LOVED THIS BOOK.
B00138GYXU|5.0|I'm a big Bruce Springsteen fan and loved all of his other albums. I owned and listened to most of the others, then I dug through his discography for The River and started streaming. I love it so much that I just wanted to buy it so I could listen to it any time. It's just such a great record. Some of my favorite tracks are &#34;Independence Day&#34;, &#34;Hungry Heart&#34;, &#34;The River&#34;, &#34;Point Blank&#34;, and &#34;Cadillac Ranch.&#34;
B004V6X90W|4.0|A friend of mine saw this movie and suggested that I watch it and I am glad I did as I enjoyed it very much.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Bought this to share with my 11 year old... Hit!!!!<br /><br />He watched it for days!!!!  Even for today's kids, don't hesitate!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is wonderful. It is almost impossible to put it down once you pick it up. Ready to read the third one.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Saw the special on PBS, and the rest is history.  Hooked on Hansgaard and Irglova - a must buy because of the originality and compositions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this a good calculator because it will give you the right answer all the time it is a awesome calculator
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The dialogue between the two competition hosts is the best part of the movie. The singing is good, but it is of course over the top as you would expect a movie directed mostly at teens would be. The cup song scene has already become a pop culture phenomenon, as it deserves to be. Not sure why they picked the lead actor- he seems way overshadowed by the female cast members.
B00985E3UG|1.0|How an industry can decay a country just by feeding them Salt Sugar Fat.<br />We as a nation have become hugh fans of these three items.  Now to figure out a way to undo it.<br />Amazing.....This book really brings out how we have become depended  on lies and test that move us<br />to eat and want more of these food.  This book was so interesting.<br />I enjoy my Kindle to be able to bring these book instantly.
B004CEUEWE|3.0|It wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I didn't like the action in it or the ending.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The grand kids really seem to enjoy this game. They love the dinosaurs and building their own park and seem to really like it
B0013F1D02|5.0|Just loved this movie and would watch it over and over again. It is a great family movie that I would really recommend to others.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This is a very long story with a great many side trips. The story is interesting and has a grand ending (which I reread several times).
B000SEGHT6|5.0|A wonderful combination of tragedy and humor. Real, touching, funny. A great read about an awful time in our history.
030758836X|5.0|Kept me guessing through out! The writing is very good inspiring great passion towards the characters. Book arrived right away.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas since he is a huge fan of gangster films. I never saw it in its entirety and I have to say it is a great movie!! It depicts the excess of the '80s and the drug trade of that time. Watching Tony Montana start as a person in search of the American Dream and then turning into a corrupt drug trafficker whose thirst for power and money leads him to a violent end. It is one of Al Pacino's best next to the Godfather. I recommend it for lovers of the gangster movie genre.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such an amazing book, it keeps you on the edge of your seat each and every chapter wondering what's going to happen next!! I absolutely loved it from start to finish!!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|This game is fun to play but it resets after you progress in it. It's very frustrating to devote hours to a game then to lose your progress.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|It's not even debatable, just buy it. All music lovers, no matter the genre, will like this. It's just plain excellent.
0307346617|4.0|This is the first Zombie book I have read and must say I was pleasantly surprised by the stories.  I was more impressed with the author's ability to create stories covering the world during pre, current and after the war.  The technical aspects covered in some of the descriptions were unbelievable and kept the reader's attention (at least mine).  This is not like other stories where you build some sort of connection toward a character since they were so many, but it is a book worth reading.  Kudos to the author and his imagination.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The ending was a total surprise.  The courtroom was not as boring as I thought it would be. Enjoyed it
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Loved it! And how could one not love little hairy footed heroes blowing smoke rings and scurrying for their lives while being chased my mongrel goblin men? How? MY childhood on the silver-screen! So, there's at least two more movies and one would hope they get the nerve up to make The Children of Hurin into a movie. If not that, I'd like to see Wheel of Time made into some kind of film. Just putting those out there for someone to pick them up and run. I'll be waiting.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Love Jennifer Lawrence!  The story line had me guessing the entire time!!!  That's what I like about these types of horror movies is when u finally find out stuff at the end of the movie!  I highly recommend this movie...if u like thrillers you should watch this one!  Very intense!
B009H2PCNC|4.0|[[VIDEOID:moTJJ8HFZ930VK]]Brian Eno is a genius. Some of his ambient music is more accessible than others - this is not for casual consumption - It is Life in Slow Motion. You must be patient. It is not, however, good background music. I tried playing it in my car and found it irritating. Wrong domain. This ambient music project was conceived as an art installation - so what's missing from the experience on CD or download is the visual component - that would add a lot to the piece(s) as a whole. As an exercise, I created a short video using the artwork from the CD, and I'll experiment with looping it and slowing down the transitions while playing the accompanying music. I'm already enjoying it more! (hope Brian doesn't mind). In summary, this is a worthy addition to the pantheon of Eno Ambience, with flawless sound as one would expect, but if you are new to this genre, you might want to start elsewhere, such as Music for Airports or Thursday Afternoon.
B0042MEQVG|3.0|Better than than first 2, not as good as  Breaking Dawn 1& 2. Guys will like the fight seen between The Cullens/Wolves and the New Born Army of Vampires.
B005K17RU0|5.0|ACCUWEATHER- the best and most accurate weather app I`'ve used. I especially love how you get a 2 week predictions.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|So the best of the series....can't wait for the finale in Breaking Dawn 2. Great visual effects on Bella's deteriation during her pregnancy.
1451695195|5.0|I'm not a big reader, but I got through this book very quickly.<br />The story is awesome. Dr. Alexander did a wonderful job of detailing his experience.<br />It is beautiful.
0385536828|3.0|I've really loved some (not all) of McEwan's work. I thought \\"On Chesil Beach\\" was brilliant, devastating. Reading through a lot of these 1,2,3-star reviews I had to chuckle, because they described my own experience with this one. About 3/4 of the way through, I said to my wife, \\"I'm glad this is almost over, because I've almost given up finding anything or anybody to really care about.\\" (Who is this supposedly independant, liberated, educated woman who falls in love with and sleeps with every man she meets? I couldn't make sense of her.) Well, things picked up at about that point, and moved along briskly to what I have to admit I found (unlike others here) to be an appealing surprise at the end. In the last 1/4, there is finally some \\"intrigue.\\" It's a book I might recommend, but not with any great enthusiasm, and with the warning that McEwan takes a loooong time in it getting to the meat of it all.
B0081336FO|5.0|wonderfully written, wonderfully acted, wonderfully produced with high values----not predictable.  great character development.  Only regret is that there are not more episodes...........
B00004TT89|1.0|I would never recommend this product to anyone. It doesn't even work. I waited so long for it to come, and when it finally did it wouldnt even work. I am very upset.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Loved this movie!  The scope of it was purely magical in it's cinematography!  Fantastic in every move, every gesture, every word.  There were no mistakes made in this film!  Will take it's proud place next to it's predesessor, Lord of the Rings!  And long may it's trilogy reign!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This is a great app to keep young to teen kids busy while you're trying to get things done around the house. Also helps to teach the young ones about colors and numbers.
B008220DIC|5.0|A great film. But who is to rate what? Haven't got all the answers but this film is better than many movies for it's script, shooting, and amazing acting. Chances are one may not understand it the first time through, if so, watch it again. It is definitely worth attention, at least, for those that consider themselves 'into' film. (A close comparison, for the depth of this movie, might be The Thin Red Line. Although, i rate The Thin Red Line as better but they are in the same field of excellent movies.)
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is a great app for middle school students to have for doing any kind of homework. It is easy to use and easy to read.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I keep buying his novels because of the past, but it's just the same old story now, no new or inventive plot twists or mystery to his stories...
B005K17RU0|1.0|The screens were always off centered, and not able to customize as other weather apps on the market. At least it was free.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|This movie no doubt reminds me of Total Recall but in a contemporary settings. I like it very much about how the characters have evolved and the way plot has developed.
B00136Q1I0|5.0|I  needed a replacement disc after losing the CD years ago. It was on sale, downloadable. Couldn't be happier. It has songs from 70s til more recent. Like the mix
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It is impressively written, but be ready to be shocked with the vivid and disturbing descriptions!  It adds to the mysteries of the story!!  Loved it!!
B003C1QIO6|5.0|Since hearing Jack Johnson while stationed in DC, we've been collecting his work.<br />Each CD has been a bit of the same but yet different. Something about the words and how Jack sings them makes it easy to listen to the whole CD. To the Sea is no different.<br />as soon as it arrived I ripped it to our iTunes collection and we grabbed a bottle of wine that night and listened to the whole CD.<br />Really enjoyed it. It is part of our party background music now. Easy listening and not too load. People ask us &#34;who is that&#34; so we just pop open the iTunes list playing and show them. Our Florida Neighbors ending up getting this CD and a few of his earlier works.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book only because one my sons recommended it. I was pleasantly surprised. The premise is so outlandishly futuristic that the author had a totally free hand to spin a great yarn.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I have most of Norah's work. I don't listen to it everyday but when i want something soothing and easy listening I pop in Norah. This CD adds to our collection and is as good or better than the last one we got.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this app.....so much fun and way cooler than the first edition especially with the  better graphics..this app is a must have.
B003D5FFY0|4.0|I only had Paul's Wings greatest hits and few iTunes singles i purchased. this was onsale and gave us a chance to have some of the music of youth and fill out the collection.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great series! Really loved \\" The Lost Boy\\"! C E is a great Doctor. Wish he did more than one season.
B000FA675C|4.0|free - had read the book years past and wanted to reread w/o buying a new copy. just starting out w/ kindle. this was a good one to start with.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly  does his usual great job, but now adds the daughter living with Harry. It has given Harry a more thoughtful persona, but never the less, it has not diminished his dedication to honoring the dead by solving the crime. Just a very excellent book and a great way to extend the life of one of my favorite detectives!
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie can sing. other here get into the depth of the CD and why each song. Us we just like hearing her sing and thus buy the CD.<br />especially if i can time it on sale.<br />this disc is great.
B00BOLFRKW|3.0|Alot of GREAT Actors n Actresses, Thats why i bought it, but, It shows how corrupt even that time how political officals were bartered with and paid off for votes.wouldnt recommend it, relates to todays times on how corrupt. my opinion
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Surprised us how good this was. especially when I was able to get it on sale. a wide range of songs and genre. she can sing and we especially like Kelly in the duets.
B00AE2J1PE|5.0|Great Movie, Good Actors, Shows how in the toughest times how folks struggle to get out. would highly reccomend it
B0086HGW42|4.0|Saw Ed on a view shows. Great voice, good songs and the disc is fun of music we like to hear while driving.
B00BF124PC|4.0|I like true life events. This movie went into details on how we really are.I would highly recommend this movie
B0018AM1YY|4.0|Neil Young playing brings back old old memories. Since my albums disappeared in one of my 20 moves many years ago. needed a replacement. So good to have it back in my collection.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Too much back and forth \\"who done it\\". No ending after all that teasing! Did not like it. I would not recommend it.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Taylor can tell a story. Got this cheap. watched for the Amazon sell and got hit that day. still pricier than the past, but now she's a bigger star. wife likes her so much we have all the CDs.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Almost every character in the show faces the delima of being good or bad. The decisions they make will determine on which side of that fine line they will end up on.  One seemingly simple choice can lead to life or death, safety or peril. The series has been very good so far.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|Good background music for those lazy sundays after church. I would not have purchased this if my wife wasn't a fan. but after hearing enya play... was worth the purchase. She likes it and it gets a fair amount of airtime in our house now.
B005NPCUC8|1.0|I thought Pink Floyd was supposed to be a great group. This album was on sale, so I bought my first album from them expecting something good. What I got was far from it. If I had been intoxicated or high on some form of drugs then I might have thought this was ok. Sadly I was extremely sober when I listened to this bunch of noise, and felt sore about wasting $3. Avoid. Can I have my money back Amazon?!
B001BKM3MQ|5.0|we like listening to John Mayer almost as much as Jack Johnson. Easy listening, solid CD and adds to our John Mayer collection.<br />way better than the sappy music you hear from others. there are stories here.
9889979942|5.0|Tom's work is absolutely phenomenal.  I've never wanted to visit a place so badly as I have wanted to visit China while reading this book.  What an amazing talent.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|we got this for a cheap, surprised us how good they sounded. impressed enough to get other ones too. good buy
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is boss to the max. I recommend it greatly. You can not turn off blood mode. That's the only bad thing.
B000ZMCVRI|4.0|we needed some island music for a party. there is none better than the master himself. especially on sale. a wide variety of his collection all right here.
0789310627|5.0|My kids love these books and they're educational too. We have four of them and we go from one to the next.
B001BKAEHW|5.0|we like listening to John Mayer almost as much as Jack Johnson. Easy listening, solid CD and adds to our John Mayer collection.<br />way better than the sappy music you hear from others. there are stories here.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great game. enjoy it very much. Color and graphics are wonderful. easy to understand and follow. cant wait for part two.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|And it's a bad joke. The story is not a good one but if the director know how to tell story, he can make it a bit more convincing.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I don't generally watch a whole lot of television, but definitely love this show. I am hooked and will be anxiously awaiting the new season.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Such a great movie for the bucks. The 3D effects look really nice on my 50'' Plasma Panasonic. I am sure will watch the movie again and again.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to download this game since I got it mid-February.  It would download to my Kindle Fire HD, then when I would try to play it, it wouldn't because it had to download MORE game data.  It kept going on and on, starting to download--then stopping-- then starting all over again, and so on and so on.  No success at all.  Same problems with other G5 games.  Needless to say, this will be the LAST G5 item I purchase or try.  A total waste of time and very disappointing!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Wife loved it...Valentines day present. She playes them in her car constantly rotating one to another and I don't know what else to say.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I think this is a very fun and addictive app once you get use to it. My son loves it...
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Fast entertaining read. Characters were interesting. Ending seemed a little rushed. Recommend borrowing the book from your local library instead of purchasing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous acting and character development. Gripping and intruiging to watch. It is entertaining and transforms to another time and space.
B0000024YL|5.0|This album is a collection of all the wonderful songs that Simon and Garfunkel wrote and performed and each brings fond memories of long ago..
B001974DG0|4.0|I simply enjoy Dean Koontz' books.  They are involved, yet easy to follow.  Most of them are suspenseful; some are gorry; all are good mysteries.  This one is no different; some of each aspect.  Keeps you wanting to move onward.
B009G9Z08S|5.0|The team who brought Frank Miller's vision to the screen did a wonderful job of adapting this gritty, classic tale. The voice acting is superb, the story flows smoothly and every decision made in the adaptation makes the film more enjoyable.<br />Kevin Conroy has always been the voice of Batman to me, but Peter is absolutely top-notch and creates a tone that seems to fit this series perfectly.  Absolutely a must-see film if you have any love of the dark knight of gotham.
B000001BZT|5.0|I been looking for this cd forever nd found it on here. It works great. I'm glad i found it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really didn't care for it at all its not that much fun to me other people might like it but i Don't it stinks so i give it three stars.sorry
B0091REZMW|3.0|ok.. until u run out of diamonds then its very very hard and almost useless and it takes 4 ever to reach another level the people who have given it 5 stars r idiots
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting presentation of the main characters and their actions and thoughts. It kept me in suspense about what was going to happen. Good insights into inter personal relationships.
B005K17RU0|4.0|When I started the app I expected a location services button but it wasn't there.When I entered my location details and I admit it did very well(and it's free:).
0307891402|5.0|A very good guide to use in Skyrim PC play. While some of the play advice was not accurate, these would only be quibbles for me and not subject to any deductions.<br />This in spite of the fact that I could not finish the Companions and the Thieves Guild Quests on my PC.This was not the fault of the book, but a serious problem Bethesda for releasing an incomplete product, in my opinion.<br />This guide is highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Its very sweet and entertaining. Its nice to have something to take care of when you dont have a pet of your own at home. Plus the graphics are pretty good for a free game.
B008742O32|5.0|Very useful to be able to use your P.C to see and control the info on the tablet(PC has larger screen)
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I prefer action movies to gushy, so this was right up my alley.  A lot of action and the required humor to keep me entertained.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|Gave this as a gift to a fan last Christmas, and it was a very nice set.  Case and all were quite impressive to the recipient and surprised it was out there for the asking.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is like watching short story after short story. I tell all my friends how entertaining they are. Watch out you will be addicted to The Good Wife.  :)
B008P9M614|5.0|Best series I have ever seen! Great mix of serious medical issues with a little bit of comedy. You can't go wrong with House!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Same as above.  So witty, and the characters are wonderful.  The acting, especially for the Spencer character ,is awesome. Hope it lasts for many seasons
B008C20TDG|5.0|So interesting- and yet not boring at all as it spews science and nutritional facts about foods and the digestion process. Love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An excellent story with some great characters. Nice to have an engineer in the forefront once in a while.<br />Once you get into this book (the series), it's very hard to put it down. I have not been able to say that about a book since I read The Martian by Andy Weir. The characters in this story go through some very tough times - and certainly not all have happy endings. The whole concept of where these people are and why they live there is very interesting. I found my opinions of the situation changing as I learned more details. Don't want to say much more as I'll end up spoiling some part and that would be a shame.<br />Cost: negligible. Value: Priceless. I'll be reading more Of Hugh Howey's work.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Not at all what I expected, which is GREAT for hollywood.  Really enjoyed the movie and highly recommend! Great acting!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use the alarm  for many different times everyday and love that it goes off even when it's in standby mode. Wonder app!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Same problem as with all free apps -- too many ads!  Annoyance of repeated ads eliminates any fun in playing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is one of the best apps I have ever had!!!Subway Surfers is a lot better than temple run.This app entertains me for hours! Who ever made this app is genius!!!!!!
B008FH6SUQ|5.0|Love using mp3 cloud player. Digital downloading music is so much better than buying cds i always manage to scratch them. Now i always have a copy and a back up with out having to rip it to my computer.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card really uses the 3rd person point of veiw to make you feel like Ender and really understand Ender's thoughts. And to believe I thought The Maze Runner Trilogy did that!!! (No offense to James Dashner his books rock! I Actually bought Ender's game while I was looking for the prequel to The Maze Runner called The Kill Order.)
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Love using mp3 cloud player. Digital downloading music is so much better than buying cds i always manage to scratch them. Now i always have a copy and a back up with out having to rip it to my computer. So much easier and faster than having to deal with cds cases sitting around.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson loves it., he's 14. Played it from a fully charged<br />battery to a dead one, so plug in cuz they'll want to play for<br />hours. Great graphics.!!
B00BUL0IHI|5.0|Download very fast and easy. Like downloads better than cds because i don't have to worry about scratching my cd. I can add it to all my devices a lot easier to.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My grandson loved it so much so that I had to get him<br />the full version. So therefor 4 stars, like I said great teased.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|The smurf case and movie was excellent shape. It played great box and sleeve protector were in alot better condition than discretion. Yes i would recommend the smurfs.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|It's difficult to find the outlet stores and fashion event sales on this app.  Everything else works fine, it's easy to view your account and search for items.
B003F48E4W|5.0|This is a lighthearted vampire movie with an emphasis on family, courage, and basic human decency.  Delicious sardonic humor.  I can watch this again with kids and not squirm.  Grandpa always cracks me up at the end.  Old guys rule!
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Barbra never ceases to amaze me. Her sincere presentation of her music is magical and truly divine. I love this album.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Very good movie. The romance was classic and tragic. The action was edge of your seat. And a great lead in to the Avengers movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a facinating read, even if the concept of a corrupt government abusing it's control over its citizens has been done in simliar ways before, this book is certainly the most detailed and memerable one of the lot.<br />Katniss is a warrior even if she refuses to acknowledge this fact in herself. She has qualities most of the other tributes lack, her compassion being the biggest difference there is.<br />The things the tributes have to endure and do are horriying in our world. None of can imagine the fear and heartache of having to pit our children against each other to the death for the amusement of a bunch sobbish rich people.<br />Personally I think Katniss teaming up with Rue was a good thing. And regardless of the reasoning behind it, it was very strategic on both their parts. Both girls can move quickly and silently, and both accompany each other nicely in terms of food.<br />The Careers' trap is simple ingenious really. what better way to eliminate the competition? They however didn't factor in how cunning Katniss is, too bad for them really.<br />Katniss' closeness to the little girl Rue really made me cry. In my opinion a child that young should no way have been forced to compete with kids much bigger than she was. I like and respect Katniss for how she not only friended the little girl but honored her as well.<br />The gesture in District 11, when they gave Katniss the loaf of fresh bread after what she'd done for Rue doesn't go unnoticed by Katniss, and certainly by the reader either. I assure you my heart broke a second time in that small gesture of gratitude from the struggling district.<br />I'm unsure how believable Peeta still being alive when Katniss finds him is. Then again, like the tributes, the reader loses track of the days as well. What seemed like two or three weeks of events could very well have only been a few days.<br />Katniss overcoming her fears and distaste for playing the role of healer is remarkable, though I don't understand how Peeta had received no gifts from the sponsors while Katniss did.<br />Peeta and Katniss play the role of lovers almost flawlessly, though how Katniss can still think that Peeta is playing a role is beyond me.<br />I was sad at Foxface's fate. That girl was truly as clever as a fox. I think the biggest shocker for me were the Muttations. That totally blew me away and broke my heart all at the same time!<br />The last few chapters of the book were totally new for me. I've seen the movie and these chapters were surprisingly absent from the film. I look forward to getting my hands on book two<br />I give this book 5 of 5derstand how Peeta had received no gifts from the sponsors while Katniss did.<br />Peeta and Katniss play the role of lovers almost flawlessly, though how Katniss can still think that Peeta is playing a role is beyond me.<br />I was sad at Foxface's fate.

B00979CS50|4.0|Most of the tracks are exceptionally good.  A couple could have been left off.  The guitar work on the extended tracks is fantastic.
B001AR0DS6|5.0|I first heard \\"Frank\\" back in 2005.  I was instantly in love.  Amy Winehouse has a way of making music that is all her own.  She is truly a gem to the modern day blues sound.  I did find Back To Black enjoyable upon its release, but nothing could top Frank.  She mixes her old school blues voice with a little bit of urban funk, and in a song or two, adding a little bit of hiphop.  Amy does an amazing job with \\"There Is No Greater Love\\", keeping up with the such greats as Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington and Miles Davis. I  recently made the easy choice of buying both, Frank and Back To Black, on vinyl.  Both records bring no disappointment.  Amy defines urban blues.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I had a tape from the 70's and it wore out.  Being able to listen to it on CD is amazing.  If you love Dylan, you will love this - and he CAN sing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great for what it is I love the fact that I know How much battery I've used and when I need to recharge. Awesome app, no issues!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What a great piece of US History. The CIA at its best and worst. It admits that the US (read CIA) overthrew Iran's Democratic leader, Mossadegh for nationalizing the oil industry to divert the oil wealth to the masses, (which sounds good to most non-oil well owning poor people) which led to the Shah of Iran, a US puppet leader, abusing the country, leading to hatred of US by the Muslim Clerics who overthrew the Shah, and the resulting danger to our Embassy people. Then the CIA showed tremendous courage in saving four Embassy personnel hidden by the brave Canadians. Of course if we hadn't overthrown that pesky democratically elected leader in the first place, they would have been our modern friends in the Muslim world all along. Despite all this, still a great film.
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|The story is great and the video and sound quality are excellent, but why an aspect ration of 1:33 to 1?  Disappointing.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|I am absolutely hooked on Fringe. Everything possible that can be imagined they put on the screen and make it come to life. Makes you wonder.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! A must see!  I highly recommend this movie to everyone!  Daniel Day Lewis is outstanding!
B002N2LEVM|5.0|I only gave season 1 of Dollhouse four stars. This second season gets five. It was a brilliant original concept from Joss Whedon, left hanging due to the need of more than one season to tell the story. Like Firefly before it, it could have been so much more had it been allowed to play out at its own pace. In this case he was given another season to finish the story, and finish it he did, and in high style.<br /><br />What was complex before now becomes downright unexpected. Who is who and why and how they got that way is a real rollercoaster ride. No one is quite what you thought, and none of them stays that way. People you liked are suddenly a little less likeable, and people you hated suddenly do something good. The best part is that all their motives, when revealed, are believable. Real people turn out to be dolls and dolls turn into real people. The ethical questions from the first season become deep moral dilemmas. The first season covered the question of whether it was ethical to remove a person's personality, even if only for a time, and replace it with another person needed to do a particular job. Now there's a new problem: If a doll can develop a new personlity of its own is it morally justifiable to &#34;kill&#34; that personality by replacing it with the original.<br /><br />Most intriguing is the central character of Echo, wonderfully played by Eliza Dushku, who sits at the center of all this. She is much better than some people give her credit for. She's not alone, though. The rest of the ensemble cast shines just as brightly. Favorite actors from other Whedon shows play a part, and they play characters far different from what they've done before.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Dollhouse is well worth watching.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I hope this will be available on DVD for Sale. Love the show and its nice to see it deals with another culture than the Romans or Greeks.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like thinking, logic games...this is a good one.  Don't be fooled by the start..some easy levels. It gets more challenging and provides some good problems requiring logical thinking.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|We love this series. I have all boys and we really enjoy watching this together. A must-watch series for those that love Science Fiction.
030759565X|4.0|A beautiful book to add to your cook-book collection. Great pictures and good recipe variety. Like the blog many of the recipes seem to depend a lot on seasonal items but that's fine. Only reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me is because I still use the blog more than the book since I've gotten it. If you really want to know more about this book before buying just head on over there and browse/read.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've been wearing this watch everyday for about a week now and I'm very impressed with it so far.  Here is my own breakdown of the watch, in no particular order:<br /><br />Size:<br />I have a 7 inch wrist and this watch fits me very nicely.  It's such a relief to find an affordable, reasonably-sized, automatic watch these days when every new watch design coming out seems to be 40mm in diameter or larger.  I would consider this a &#34;mid-sized&#34; watch for anyone with a medium to small wrist.  Also, in case anyone is interested, the width of the lugs and strap for this watch is 18mm.<br /><br />Fit and Finish:<br />The quality and craftsmanship of this watch is pretty outstanding considering it only cost $60.  The dial is sharp and the lume is totally useable.  Make no mistake, this watch was most likely assembled entirely by robots, but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing (they did a pretty good job on mine).  The watch strap leaves a little to be desired, feeling a bit coarse on the skin; I'll probably replace it eventually, but for now, it's doing just fine.<br /><br />Accuracy:<br />I've been keeping track of my watch's accuracy compared to the US atomic clock for the last week and I have to say I'm impressed.  It's been consistently 2-4 seconds fast per day, which is even more accurate than its officially stated specifications.  In other words, it's overachieving in a big way.  To get more accurate than this you are going to have to shell out at least 5 times the cash.<br /><br />Automatic Mechanism:<br />This watch employs a Seiko 7S26C movement, which, in my humble opinion, is an absolute marvel of modern engineering.  It is rumored that this mechanism costs all of $10 to produce, which, if true, is simply amazing.  It's extremely efficient in winding the mainspring and is reported to be very durable, shock-resistant, and extremely low-maintenance in the long-term.  You couldn't really ask for much more from such an inexpensive movement.  I will say, the rotor does &#34;rattle&#34; ever so slightly when the watch is jerked around suddenly, but this is nothing that you can hear unless you have it close to your ear.  It hasn't bothered me at all and doesn't seem to have any impact on the function of the watch.  Lastly, this movement is not officially &#34;hackable&#34; but you can actual manually force it to hack by turning the crown slightly against its normal rotation direction while in the second position... this effectively stops the seconds hand.  If you turn it back to normal then the second hand starts back up again.  Hack achieved!  Now just set the hour and minutes and you're good to go.<br /><br />Water Resistance:<br />This watch has a stated water-resistance of 30 meters (or 3 ATM).  I haven't really tested this, but I have washed the watch in a sink without any incident.  Personally, I won't hesitate to swim in this watch even though the manufacturer guidelines tell you not to swim in a 30m WR watch (the manufacturers are just covering their own skin, in my opinion, but your opinion might vary).  I'm betting that this watch will most likely keep a seal while the gaskets and O-rings are relatively new, and besides, it's only a $60 watch anyway... not worth losing sleep over.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Compared to many of the more expensive automatic watches out there, this watch basically gives you 80% of the functionality for 20% of the cost (or less!).  I'd say that's a steal any way you look at it!y, the rotor does &#34;rattle&#34; ever so slightly when the watch is jerked around suddenly, but this is nothing that you can hear unless you have it close to your ear.

B008N1LL42|2.0|The first bit of the movie is pretty funny, especially the store videocam of Alex's attempts to get the chicken burrito.  The rest of it can best be described in this way:  some directors should be turned loose with CGI, some should not.  Number Peter Berg among the latter.<br /><br />I do have a question:  what's \\"Fortunate Son\\" doing running over the end credits?
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Even for non car racers.  You will get hours of fun.  Can't wait to earn more coins to get more upgrades.<br />Adults and kids should enjoy this application.
0385338910|4.0|Boy, would I love to live in Westchester.  You see, based on Tropper's portrayal, it's the land of beautiful women.  The protagonist's former wife was beautiful, his twin sister is beautiful, his younger sister is beautiful, Angie is beautiful, Brooke is beautiful, Laney Potter is beautiful ...<br /><br />But wait.<br /><br />There's a danger. The men of Westchester can't control their tempers.  Jim can become crazed, and Stephen can become crazed, and Russ can become crazed, and Dave Potter can become crazed, and even our friendly protagonist, Doug, can become crazed.<br /><br />But ... get past -- or gloss over -- these redundancies, and you can enjoy a somewhat-humorous, absorbing, action-driven tale. As in his other novels (the two I've read), Tropper nails his characters with keen, interesting and believable insights.  And peppers the plot with a nice touch of intrigue.  And makes it hard for the reader (at least this reader) to put the book down.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It has a lot of mini games which I like, but I played the whole thing in a couple of hours. The game gets you hooked and then you have to pay. I only paid 99&cent; when I did it though. For a dollar it was a night of entertainment.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Very emotional. The dog really did it for me. As a dog owner the loyalty is amazing. I highly recommend all to see it

B00886XQO0|5.0|I was using a wired headset before and the Tango is such an improvement. I might not use all the bells and whistles on the headset but the wireless range helps reduce interference from my wireless router, the sound is great and I can chat wirelessly on xbox. What else could you ask for.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|And he is nasty, and I don't believe an iota of his performance.  Not believable.  I like Diane Keaton in almost everything she does and am glad her wrinkles were not airbrushed.  Rachel Mc Adams is too beautiful and too smart, and just too much to be real here.  Not particularly good film.  Not believable and as I said, i don't think I have ever seen Mr. Ford  in a less likable role.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|this keyboard takes Android to the next degree! I'm typing everything much faster without having to do much more work! highly recommended for all Android users

B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone. 9 year old done played for hours yesterday and told me thank you for downloading
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The story is great however the editing is terrible and it is badly written.  The names are spelt one way and then another a few paragraphs on.  The writer writes about one character and uses another characters name.  Terrible editing, badly written but great story. The series could be one or 2 books.
B001QWBM62|3.0|It is way too complicate to use. I wanted an excellent recorder, but to record meetings only . I have trouble getting it to record, when I do it turns off automatically, or the volume is way too low, etc. I am sure once it was used properly it would be  Fine. Again much too complicated for our use.

B004H6G0TI|5.0|I really enjoyed this side-scrolling flight game. MiniSquadron brings back memories of the 16-bit era when games where about one thing and one thing only - fun. Not hyper-realistic graphics or realistic physics but just pure,simple fun. MiniSquadron is an entertaining and challenging flight game that I highly recommend.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I like it, but with just a few refinements it would be great.  The tabs that hold the Kindle upright do not engage solidly, and the magnetic sleeper in the cover only engages if you press directly on the cover after closing it.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|I'm going to have to go back and watch the movie now. This book is just so in depth into all the descriptions of the religion (Mercerism) and the scenery, etc. really immersive.
0307279189|4.0|I bought this book because I read an article somewhere by some famous runner who listed his favourite 10 running books and said of this book \\"but you have this book already\\", so I thought it must be good.<br /><br />Actually it's a fun book and it did make me want to get fit and just go for a run.  I'd never heard of the Tarahumara (I thought all the great runners were from East Africa).  I also knew little about the UltraMarathon scene, so it was interesting, and written in an entertaining way, much in the mould of Ben Mezrich (bringing down the house, etc).<br /><br />Two things kind of annoyed me though.  Part way through the book it detours into a discourse about barefoot running and how the shady shoe companies were making us all get injured.  Although thought-provoking, I found this to be rather one-sided.  The premise as McDougall put it is that modern running shoes are meant to make you run better, but all they do is make you run on your heels, and get you injured.  He may well have a point.  However, he ignores a lot of contradictory facts such as the cushioning effect of shoes (running in non-cushioned shoes makes your feet hurt!).  Also, if barefoot running is so effective, how many olympic runners raced barefoot in the last Olympics?  Although it was an interesting aside, it verged upon evangelsing, and I think he laboured the point.  I actually think Nike could probably have sued him for some of the accusations to be honest.  He really didn't need to name names to get his point across.<br /><br />The other thing was that the characters seemed completely over the top.  I really hope for their sake that they are not the 'wild and crazy guys' that he portrayed them as.  If I was running with one of the characters and they really were as outrageous as he made out, well i'd just think they were all obnoxious jerks, regardless of how fast they can run.<br /><br />These two criticisms aside, I would recommend this book to anyone feeling a bit out of shape andwanting to get back into running.  I think it will inspire you to get out there and do it.
B005NPCUC8|4.0|It's really a work of genius and also represents a high degree of attainment in the areas of engineering and recording.  Two things bother me about the album which - in balance I think were common and partial to the experimental period in which it was created.  First of all the strange vocalizations of the female singer were in some places- hideous and contribute nothing.  Also - I find the use of medley distracting- perhaps it is just me, but having a song with it's own discrete identity actually makes the songs more powerful.  Additionally it makes them of course more easy to appreciate as unique entities.  The wall does this with the medleys a lot too yet I can forgive it to a greater extent there because the wall feels like it has a monolithic and opera-like purpose which is to a greater extent more realized and more justified with respect to the medleys.  These are just my personal impressions though.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Nothing new with the movie, but 3d is good...the fighter scenes are the best..and of course, the boys playing volley ball will never be a bad scene :)
B004TI5N38|4.0|This is the second book from the author with the John Puller character that I have read. Before reading &#34;Zero Day&#34; i read &#34;The Forgotten&#34; That story got me hooked to &#34;Puller&#34; and some of the characters here were developed in &#34;Zero Day&#34;.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Even though Bond is older, he's still the best at everything he does best. Always action packed, great ending. You've gotta watch this one, they set us up perfectly for the next one!
B005LAIHYU|5.0|OK, It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it is fun.  Once you are past theoutrageous plot, sit back and enjoy the ride
B00ARA4SLU|1.0|I never give a one-star review, but Twentieh Century Fox has really rattled the cage.  First of all, I loved the movie.  For me, it was a lot of fun watching Anthony Hopkins and Helen Miren in their roles.  It also was great seeing Michael Wincott back as the killer, Ed Glein.  I knew a good bit about Psycho the novel, and a little on the making of the movie.  This film just filled in the pieces for me.<br /><br />My complaint isn't with the film, but rather with how the DVDs were packaged.  If you own a regular DVD player, the only way to see the film is to buy the Blue Ray Edition with the regular DVD included.  You therefore pay a higher cost for the movie.  Then, when you search for extras on the DVD, the only thing you find are trailers for other movies.  All the extras are on the Blue Ray Edition, and you can't watch a Blue Ray disc in a regular DVD player, so you're screwed.<br /><br />I won't fall for this type of marketing again.  I'll simply wait a year or two for the price to come down and then purchase it.  Of course, the movie will probably be out on television by then.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Awesome performances, beautiful music, powerful story. ...PS, the entire movie is sung..Not your typical hollywood musical.. talk talk talk, music swells song....The voices are good, but not as strong as the Broadway or London cast.  A film worth watching when you pay attention and listen.  The movie is an experience.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, Your heart will race, a new Classic.
B007SGM084|5.0|Every one was reading it and talking and saying I am not telling any more. You need to read it. So I did all 3 books. Very informative and education  in deciding your sexual  appetite. Would recommend for female and male to read.

0307352153|5.0|This book is fantastic.  It confirms that I am an introvert and provides a scientific basis that proves I don't need to feel bad for wanting to stay home rather than socialize most of the time!  It is well written and fascinating.
1451695195|3.0|I bought this book, as I suppose many did, according to the bestsellers lists, looking for more evidence of the afterlife. But I found myself reading way too much about Dr. Alexander's earthbound experiences. I'm sure they were used to put his extraordinary experience into better perspective, but that's not what this reader were looking for, having to plod through the life's experiences of one man to find what he had learned when he visited the afterlife. I found myself skipping the chapters about the hospital and what was going on around his &#34;body&#34; while he was having this experience. In fact, I still haven't finished it. There seemed to be a little more philosophizing than was necessary, or at least than I wanted. However, my first boss was Dr. Raymond A Moody Jr.'s brother-in-law (I believe that was the relationship), so I have been interested in this subject since my teens. (I'm now in my mid-50s). What Dr. Alexander said confirmed something I have thought after participating in a spiritual, not religious program and from listening to scientific debate about whether there is a God and an afterlife. I have come to the conclusion that there are both, and that the truth is so far beyond our understanding that there's no point in participating in debates. God is not a being as we know beings, I think. A better explanation is that He is more like the air we breathe, unseen but all encompassing. And I did find Dr. Alexander's observation that our understanding is very limited by our physical being, and once freed, we will be fully aware. I<br />thank Dr. Alexander for bringing forth his story. And he must have made a lot of money, too, but good for him.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I love Spielberg movies and he delivered here. It has the feel of a movie looking back on life, kind of like Stand By Me, but in a more ET suspense type of way. I thought this would be great for 12 or 13 years olds, but the F bomb is dropped once at the end of the movie.
030758836X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It uses an artful way to tell the story of two people whose marriage has gone hopelessly wrong.  While neither of the main characters are particularly likeable, it doesn't really matter because you are waiting to learn what happens next. It was one of the best suspenseful novels I've read in a long time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! It is so much easier than going online! The setup is very nice and it is easy to look at your pins. GET THIS APP!!
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|To be honest when I saw the preview for ROTG in the theaters I really wasn't interested in seeing it ... regardless to say, the preview didn't do the movie justice.  Then I started hearing from alot of people that they had enjoyed it and they recommended it to me since I love animated films.  For the most part recent animated movies have been lackluster for me, ROTG  was not only enjoyable but very funny too. The storyline was great and creative and put a nice spin to characters we all know.  The voice characterization was phenomenal, and I fell in love with Jack's character. The movie had it all: comedy, adventure, but best of all it had heart.  Hopefully a sequel will me made, but I don't know how they will be able to top this one.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This movie teaches the consensequences of greed and how the wasting of natural resources can negatively effect everyone for a lifetime...but in a fun, humorous way that reaches kids.
B002PNDEXK|3.0|Not really very good. It's not as well done as a more recent movie.They look too modern and not as the characters should.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|If you like gory movies with lots of sword fighting and evil space alien monsters crashing in Norway in the iron age, this is one of the best movies of that genre.  It even has an eight foot tall shaved-head viking who uses two Thor hammers instead of a sword, which seems like a bad choice but he can do it if he wants because he is, ... well, you know,... eight feet tall.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Awful. Just terrible. Bring back the Arnold. He'd terminate this. This is too glitsy and the actor is too well -known for other inferior parts in lousy movies.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well done.  Truly one of those 'can't put it down' books.  From the first page on, I was hooked.  The author weaves the threads of a courtroom drama, a family drama, and questions about our legal system into a compelling novel that leaves the reader thinking and wondering long after the final page.
B002K99P7S|5.0|This was a good movie. It has a lot of action and the story was good. It was nice to know where he came from.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I feel like this book has been written many times before.  It was an okay read but definitely not very memorable.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I hate to disagree with so many fine reviews of this film, but disagree I must. Unfortunately for me at least, LES MISERABLES is a cinematic experience that might have been but fundamentally isn't.<br /><br />I think the fault for much of this lies in two decisions Tom Hooper made very early on in the process. First was the decision to, for the most part, rely upon actors rather than singers. I'm sure a sense of what constitutes good \\"box office\\" was a factor here, but, in the end, I think Mr. Hooper (and whoever else) should have had a bit more faith in the essential product. Sung well, with singers who can act, the production might have been truly memorable, even a classic of sorts, the product is that good. The final result, sadly, is rather less than it might have been.<br /><br />To Mr. Hooper's credit, Russell Crowe, as Javert, looks inspired. On paper. And I must admit I looked forward to his performance with great anticipation. Alas, despite Mr. Crowe's best efforts, he is not a confident singer, and most of his concentration seems focused on the vocal demands of the role - which are considerable - leaving little left over for the actor's projection of character. As a result, Javert seems flat, almost wooden. Alongside the performances of a few others in the cast - those who are singers first and actors second - the contrasting mix-and-match is unfortunate, sometimes painful. I thought Mr. Crowe deserved better.<br /><br />Mr. Crowe (and others), I think, were also undone by Mr. Hooper's second decision: recording and filming live. This is not unheard of, of course - for a particular character (Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins comes to mind) or a song here and there, but not an entire score. For a professional cast, three hours on stage is demanding enough. On the other hand, rehearsals and ten-hour shooting days, complete with retakes, must have been sheer torture, particularly for voices not sufficiently trained for it or accustomed to it. I know: dubbing andlip syncing the entire film would have been an arduous task, a task that probably would have produced uneven results at best. All the more reason, I would think, to opt for a cast of professional singers.<br /><br />By comparison, the other issues with the film seem almost nit-picking. Without question, film is a different medium than the stage. Even so, it's probably not a good idea to try to inject emotion into the proceedings by an unrelenting and almost terminal dependence on the close-up, to the point where the film, in places, suffers from a severe case of claustrophobia, a feeling entirely absent from the stage production. Then too, stage actors are supported emotionally by performing with a live orchestra. Singing - or attempting to sing - accompanied by an earpiece is just not the same. The adrenaline is missing, and, too often, the actors seem to be suffering from abandonment. Given all this, it is a wonder the cast was able to perform as well as it did.<br /><br />I guess the final question might well be whether it is possible to make LES MISERABLES into a successful film at all. Not any easy question, but one would have to guess that this particular attempt must have given a good many people serious pause. Yet I do think that, given the early decisions that were made, the film we got was as good as it COULD have been. It certainly never suffered from a lack of commitment or effort, and Mr. Hooper can certainly NOT be cited for a lack of courage. For me, however, the more satisfying and emotional performances are presented in either of the Anniversary Editions, both of which were taped live and both of which are still currently available. I think they more fairly represent what LES MISERABLES was meant to be.<br /><br />This is not to say DON'T BUY THE DVD OF THE FILM. They are simply very different experiences. For myself, I bought all three.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|absolutely the most wonderful film ever made, and the 3D is spectacular.  I wish I could have been on that journey.  Note this NOT the 3D version, I've also reviewed that.

B00122FXQQ|5.0|I dont know why but its just awesome. Im in my late twenties and I guess Neil Young might be considered before my time, but it is really a powerful piece of music.
B004OZZ624|3.0|Not bad for a night's entertainment.  The story is fairly predictable, but the acting is good and the story moves along at a quick pace.  I thought the director missed out on an opportunity to better highlight the--Did She, or Didn't She conflict, which was barely developed at all.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I wish I could have seen this movie in the theater but receiving it yesterday made my day. Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Fields, although so recognizable in the acting world, become Abraham and Mary instantly and you are transformed. The child playing Tad did not really mirror the child that I have come to know through reading and research about the Lincolns but was sufficient.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had an absolute blast with this omnibus.  Five short novels.  I knocked this out on vacation and would love to read it again.  A recommendation for anyone who likes lightly political science fiction.
0307352153|3.0|I strongly believe in the &#34;premise&#34; of this book.  I am an engineer and have throughout my career found that those who do the work are generally overlooked in favour of those who TALK about the work.<br /><br />I''m only about half way through so maybe the book picks up later, but so far the book comes across to me almost &#34;apologetic&#34; about &#34;daring&#34; to suggest that the talkers don't always (and sometimes and perhaps generally don't) know what they are talking about.<br /><br />That said, I do reccommend the book.  Us &#34;thinkers&#34; andf &#34;doers&#34; need to assert more and wrestle away some of the control from the &#34;talkers&#34; and &#34;smoke blowers&#34;.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have liked Ken Follett's previous books tremendously, especially PIllars of the Earth.  I love the history of this one, but I'm sorry to have to say that, to me,  his writing in this one is somewhat sophomoric.<br /><br />Still - I would recommend it.

B00AFEY354|5.0|The degree of tenderness this movie evokes is nearly overwhelming! Flawless script and direction. The three leads are amazing. Emma Watson is destined to be a major star. Why this film was ignored in favor of lesser fare like \\"Silver Linings Playback\\" is a mystery to me. You'd have to have a heart of lead not to be moved by this wonderful, perceptive film.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|Since I love Puccini's music a lot, and Tosca particularly so, I have gathered at home quite a collection of older recordings and more recent DVDs with the full opera. I have also seen it performed on stage a half dozen times. Angela Gheorghiu accomplishes a truly outstanding rendition of Floria Tosca, clearly surpassing in musicianship and vocal characterization  older renditions by Callas (I have in mind the Callas- Di Stefano disc), Tebaldi (both Tebaldi - del Monaco disc and Tebaldi - Di Stefano), Kabaivanska (Kabaivanska - Domingo disc), L. Price (Price - Corelli disc), S. Verrett (Verrett - Pavarotti disc) and M. Freni (Freni - Pavarotti disc).<br /><br />I won't bother enumerating the more contemporary recordings (Cedolins, Magee), because they are so far behind in quality that they will soon be forgotten.<br /><br />As if Gheorghiu's performance wasn't enough of a marvel, this recording also benefits from a strong Cavaradossi (Kaufmann) and a very distinctive Scarpia (Bryn Terfel). Pappano's conducting is a further demonstration of his elective affinity for Puccini's musical universe.<br /><br />+ If you want to hear Gheorghiu singing Tosca live, buy your tickets for September 2013, Vienna State Opera (four performances).
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It is rare to encounter a game that is challenging in a cerebral way, enticing, entertaining, engaging -- and all without noise, explosions swords or spells. The player's skill is in observation: of patterns, of spatial content, of moves and consequences of moves. It is a game that encourages calm, as speed will not benefit a player if the terrain is misunderstood. It offers a rare quality in a game: charm.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have been a voracious reader at times in my life, but not lately as I am caught up in motherhood, work, family.  I admit that I have, since my late teens, at times dabbled, other times immersed, myself in meditation, consciousness expansion etc.  My sister sent me this book for Christmas and I read it non-stop for a few days.  I will say that it transformed me during the time I read it and afterwards for several weeks and beyond.  People who have taken illicit drugs talk of a &#34;contact high&#34;, and that is the only way that I can describe what I experienced after reading the book.  I felt expanded, joyous, loving and blissful.  At times it was almost overwhelming - I felt that I was connected to all other life.  I also, not having been raised in a church or a religion, felt an understanding towards the religions of the world and the people who followed them.  I saw the core of every religion as essentially the same and felt unbounded and bonded.  It was amazing and I can't explain it's occurrence, but I miss it.  It was awesome, in the true sense of the word.<br /><br />I also, intellectually, felt disappointed.  As others have said, he doesn't really go into very much scientific detail.  As a medical professional I wanted to see MRI results, EEG results, medical records - or at least links to them if I wanted to see them.  From a medical point of view it was all very superficial, and as a neurosurgeon I would have thought he could see that.  My only conclusion from the lack of this information was that it doesn't support his claims.<br /><br />The expansion and bliss have faded, leaving me with a feeling of loss and wanting to get it back.  I don't know what to say in conclusion about the book.  I have recommended it to others, with varying responses, and I feel I am still experiencing lingering effects, not all of them pleasant.  And I have been left with an enduring feeling that consciousness is an enigma that we really have no understanding of, and that in itself was worth the read.

B006Z9K97E|5.0|I've always been fascinated with North Korean culture, mainly because there is so little known about the country, but also because it amazes me that total dictatorships are still around in this day and age. Did we not learn many valuable lessons with Hitler's Third Reich and his Nazi concentration camps or Stalin's Soviet gulags? Nazi concentration camps existed for 12 years, while Stalin's gulags were open for 42 years. In comparison, North Korean prison camps have existed for over fifty years and there seems to be no end in sight for the endless suffering and brainwashing for the 150,000 to 200,000 prisoners that live in these camps today.<br /><br />This is the remarkable story of a North Korean man named Shin Dong-hyuk. Born and raised in Camp 14, Shin lives a brutal existence in one of North Korea's worst political prisons. As a child, Shin scavenged for bark, roots and kernels of corn to keep his hunger at bay. He was constantly reprimanded, overworked, starved, beaten and tortured, and he worked under the threat of being executed every day. He had no access to healthcare, no personal possessions to speak of, and he lived in the same clothes day in and day out. Shin grew up believing that it was natural to be hungry, and that he deserved to be treated like an animal. He ate watery cabbage soup, corn flour and corn kernels every day of the year. He was encouraged to snitch on his family and friends, and he might never be able to completely face the role that he played in the deaths of his mother and brother. Compassion, love, and honor were completely foreign concepts to Shin.<br /><br />Eventually Shin does the unthinkable. He escapes from prison, and becomes the first person that was born in a North Korean prison to ever escape. He makes his way to China and then on to South Korea and the United States, where he struggles to accept that his upbringing was not normal.<br /><br />Today, Shin is a North Korea human rights activist and he is still trying to dealwith the horrific acts of violence and atrocities that he was forced to commit as a prisoner in North Korea<br /><br />This was one of the hardest books I've ever read. It's heart-breaking to read what these people go through. The poverty, the hunger and the brainwashing that these people are subjected to is simply to much too fathom.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great puzzle game. Every level is well thought out and fair. I especially appreciate the hint system on the really tricky puzzles.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It was another interesting Pendergast story and I'm glad the autors keep writing them. I've enjoyed the series especially the first ones.
B009AMANBA|2.0|Let's set Daniel Day-Lewis to the safe side a minute - he was brilliant,though it confounds me why a British actor had to be cast as an American president;maybe Sean Penn is much too short,Redford fourscore too old and Tim Robbins just simply too stupid.I'm sure these lefties  would have loved to have been adored as a Republican president. Spielberg never figures out how he wants to portray Lincoln - politician or saint. Without being ironic,  I  can safely say the best part of the movie was the end. What a mess.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Before i start this review i want to point some things out. 1) I am a guy, my name is Josh and I really enjoyed this film 2) I watched this and the 2010 remake of True Grit in the same day. To be completely honest, I liked Black Swan a WHOLE lot better than True Grit. And i am in no way saying True Grit is a bad movie, its just my opinion. Natalie Portman won the Academy Award for Best Actress for a reason back in 2011. I mean in this film she is just flat out amazing! The supporting cast is great too. To Detail the storyline, there is a lot of ballet involved, but this film is much much deeper than that. There were a FEW moments that i was actually a little freaked out, and once you watch Black Swan you will see why. Some of the scenes I did not see coming. So to sum it Up: Great Storyline, Well-Acted, and the direction/choreography is Excellent. Again I will say My name is Josh i Am a guy, and i think this movie is Wonderful; one that will be added to my dvd collection. 5 stars
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Movie was very funny.  Soundtrack is great.  Very disappointed in Amazon streaming services lately.  Movie lagged every 5 minutes or so for about 30 seconds.  I had speedtest up during streaming and during lagtime and was consistently getting 20+ mbs download and 3.5+ mbs upload at all times.  Streaming issues were firmly on the amazon servers.  Will not purchase again until they resolve whatever issues they have going on right now.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|An excellent Steven Wilson CD. The best one yet. I'm going to drive to Cleveland to watch him perform The Raven after I listened to it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|it has very good graphi  and i like that you can change the controls to your confertable position to get good kills
B0014KFV6I|5.0|With some new stuff for a great price. Too good to pass up. I saw Carole open for James Taylor back when he toured to support Sweet Baby James! Great memories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a must play kinda game, love it! if you love horse games your love this one plus it's free which it means it's a 2x game. I give it 5 stars no matter what
B0085LMFAE|5.0|Saw a show on PBS about the making of this record, and this was always on my turntable when it was first released and Amazon had a great price so I downloaded this.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|This game is so addicting. I got over 7000 coins but then all the sudden the game restarted.I was about to get the tiger shark and I went all the way back to the reef shark. This game was not even worth the space it took up on my kindle.Please fix it futer games of london.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and had a hard time putting it down, yet hated for it to end. A lot of grammatical errors but did not take away from the book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Spectacular story telling that just doesn't put more realism into an unimaginable situation. Well done. Well done, indeed.  Ready to start the journey over again!
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|i hated it because the movie disc wasnt in the case. the special features disc was so i overpayed big time
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|great game I just wish it had the monkey engineer and the bloonchipper but still a great game,  still get the game it is so fun
B00498YZH8|5.0|I am an action movie fan usually, but after reading article about Jennifer Lawrence I decided to give this one a try.  I do veer off to dramas every now and again if some sparks my interest.  This one did and I was definitely not disappointed.  Great acting and a good story that kept you interested.  I would definitely recommend.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Gosh I love me some Angry Birds. Addictive & challenging gameplay. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the free version has a lot of irritating ads. If you want to get down w/ some Angry Birds spend the couple bucks for the game, it's worth it not to deal w/ the ads.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Yes it's embellished, yes there characters in the film that never existed, but that's to be expected from this kind of story. Ben Affleck has come a LONG way from &#34;Dazed and Confused&#34; and &#34;Mallrats&#34;.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this App, lets me know how much power, w/ a numerical value, I have left so I have a better idea of how soon I've got to hook up the charger. Wish I had this for my IPad 2
B000003TA4|3.0|this CD is one of the most legendary, groundbreaking, most popular CD's to ever be released.<br />My purchase was from :: and the CD is clearly not the official copy. The art work is copied and blury and the art on the CD is not the original.<br />The audio however is the same as the original release from '91. I know so because I still have my original copy. This is why I rated it 3 stars. The audio is most important. BUT if they are duplicating CD art with no care for our eyes.. what will they do to our ears? and our children's ears? when duplicating sound?
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Awesome & highly addictive game play. They are still currently developing levels for it, so there is more to come
B000000OQF|1.0|The audio for this was completely remastered. and some will think that remastered is a good thing. it. is. NOT.<br />the Sound was so digital and the guitars were way to our in front. Compared to the original recording it is.. THERE IS NO COMPARISON.<br />there should be clearly stated that this is remastered and there should be a poll taken. Remastered or original recording... I would have to guess that most people would vote ORIGINAL!!!!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Nicely made and my son loves it.  Works great. Nice price. Makes the Kindle stand right up for viewing nicely.
B000085RPU|1.0|I purchased this DVD and was so excited to watch it. Imagine my disappointment when it would not work on my DVD player or PS3.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is for the whole family.  It's funny, silly, warm and about friendships and about doing the right thing.
0066620996|5.0|Great Book!  I really cannot say much more.  There is plenty of learning tools in this book to assist anyone in need.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Denise
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The twists and turns along with how the pieces intertwine are truly fascinating with this series. It's very well written and the characters are surprisingly believable given the Fairytale premise.  You will find yourself starting another episode immediately after finishing the last one. It's very hard to get up and walk away!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Very nice movie to watch with the kids. The characters are very well presented and at the end, the dreams overpower the darkness. Beautiful message.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well-written, well done. I'm very glad I read it before seeing the movie. On reading this, the ending was a surprise. The cinematography of the film--the way the ocean is filmed--gives it away.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but it badly needs an update. I have it on my kindle fire and it won't let me be the host of a game, my sister also downloaded it on her kindle but she couldn't host a game either, I give it 4.5.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I downloaded this app last night and it worked fine, today I went to turn on my kindle and it wouldn't turn on. Finally after searching online on my laptop troubleshooting problems, I got it on again. After I finally got it turned on I couldn't open any app without the app crashing. I right away deleted this app and re started my kindle and it works fine. I don't really know if it was this app that messed up my kindle but after is was deleted it worked fine again
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Great show its like a horror comedy and love story all rolled into one you really want to be on dexters side
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I will freely admit that the first time I listened to this album it didn't grab me.  I was a bit panicked that they had gone and released another ambient mess such as Exciter.  That was the only album that I really could never get into by this band, not bad though with a thirty three history at this juncture.  They came storming back with the outstanding Playing The Angel and I eventually came to the point where I liked their next release, Sounds Of The Universe quite a bit more.  Once I spun Delta Machine a few more times, though, it all gelled and I already like this one best of their recent three releases.  They are going from strength to strength at this point and this album is a latter day masterpiece not seen since Violator in my humble opinion.<br /><br />No matter how great many of their album have been since Alan Wilder left I really felt they never fully recovered in terms of musicianship.  The actual synth work was becoming pedestrian on PTA and SOTU which wasn't a major problem because so many of the songs were outstanding regardless.  A lot of fans don't realize how much texture and depth Alan added to every song recorded during his tenure while Martin and company went clubbing in Berlin or whatever.  He was the one in the studio for long hours fully fleshing out each track and adding all the layering of sounds and effects that made their songs so unique.  I am in no way slagging the musicianship of previous post-Wilder albums, just that that they lacked his final touch. Delta Maching has both lyrical, and most crucial, musicality to match.  It has some downright Kraftwerk-esque moments where you are both mesmerized and fascinated by the instrumentation on display.<br /><br />This record has so many great songs its hard to pinpoint the best but Heaven, the hypnotic Secret To The End, Soft Touch/Raw Nerve, Slow, Should Be Higher and Goodbye are standouts for me.  I'm a little ridiculous with this band and bought both the CD Deluxe version and the vinyl release.  The CD version is two discs with what I believe will end up being the b-sides to various future singles and comes housed in a sturdy book style case.  The vinyl is split over two 180G platters with anti-static/dust inner sleeves with pictures of the band on one side and lyrics reprinted on the reverse.  They are housed in a medium weight, gate-fold outer sleeeve with a picture of the band displayed when unfolded.  The vinyl appears high quality and they play clean and quiet.  The vinyl edition does come with the four bonus tracks present on the Deluxe CD version and it also includes a download card for a 320kpbs digital copy.elease.

B004I744AS|5.0|I loved this app from the start. I'm the type of person who reads all of the time, so this was incredibly important. Also, this is very user-friendly and not complex at all. You are even allowed to listen to the pronunciation of each word.
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire.  I can't stop playing it.  And you can't beat the price it was free
B005EGXTEE|4.0|No sex naive and future of Earth hopefully better than portrayed but realistically a possibility.<br />Definitely worth reading by adults
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It was so funny  when Greg  was in the women bathroom !<br /><br />I think Rodrick does stink in the band Löaded Diaper .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it. I'd recommend to everyone. Probably read it a dozen times already. It never gets old. Movie is great to.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Service was very quick and the price was good.  Thanks for your speedy service.  I really appreciate your efforts!  Nice to do business with a company that cares.
B007QJBHRS|5.0|How could you not be in love with Carey Grant?! He was such a gorgeous man, and beautiful doesn't begin to describe Doris Day. They are so adorable in this movie. I love this kind of movie. Makes you wish for more simple times :-)
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I know this is film not theater but that is no excuse for the casting of key individuals who either can't sing or were directed to sound like an obnoxious bird (yes, I am talking to you Amanda Seyfried). The glorious quartet and quintets were ruined by the distracting cuts and for all the closeup solo numbers there was a lack of intimacy that left me cold. Thank heavens for the second half of the movie that brought Marius, Eponine, and Gavrosh front and center...their performances were authentic and powerful. Anne Hathway as best supporting actress! I think not...
B007LE2VDM|5.0|Great discovery for me. Started with a song on the radio, then I had to find out more and now I can't stop listening to the whole CD. She has one of the most beautiful voices out there while the lyrics are poignant.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|ok. pretty good for passing time. not sure how much I will pay to play though. would rate 3.5 stars if it was available.
0385349947|5.0|Thank you, Ms. Sandberg, for consistently, forcefully, and intelligently pushing for more female leadership. I truly admire your scientific approach to the problem, but also appreciate the candid descriptions of your personal experiences. As an academic scientist, I could not be further from the corporate world, but just as you intended many of the problems and solutions you describe are applicable to women pursuing a wide array of careers. Continue the good work, you are an inspiration!

B002L3ARRU|5.0|Classic high school comedy, Matthew Broderick shines, the writing is terrific & witty, not dated at all, still holds up today as a very funny movie.
B0027Z5DM6|4.0|My 11 year old son especially like this one....  but it 'spoke' to the whole family.  Will enjoy this one again some day.
B00C2ML9P4|4.0|The first episode or two offer us an Oliver Queen that is hard to like (even difficult to tolerate at all, at times) but this is his defense mechanism.  The combination anti-hero/hero struggles with his return to civilization, and a return to the city his father was apparently working to destroy.  Stating simply that \\"Oliver Queen has issues\\" is like stating cancer is bad.  The first episode or two, Queen seems almost too poorly behaved and playboy-ish, for someone who spent five years stranded on the DeathRace 2000 version of Gilligan's Island.  However, viewers should stay with it for at least 4 or 5 episodes, as the show quickly finds its mark.<br /><br />The episodes are believable (spoiler: wondering how they got their luxury boat off the bottom of the Pacific - all the pieces of it), and the flashbacks to the Island offer solid interplay between \\"then and now.\\"  The sci-fiction, tech, and toys do not overwhelm the actors and actresses; there is solid story here that will bring viewers back if they give it a chance.  Both gentleman and lady viewers will find enjoyable characters (especially ladies who like to count a guy's scars, or watch a guy do inverted pushups.)  Green Arrow fans should also find a lot to like here, including an episode where Queen actually runs out of arrows (any fans remember how many he carries?)<br /><br />Give Arrow a shot!!
B001VS46DC|5.0|Diana Krall at her best.  The music, the setting, and Diana's unique piano artistry and voice make this a show to watched over and over.

B0036BK6MW|4.0|This is another movie I have already seen.  But, enjoyed so much, decided to buy it.  Although, I haven't  a chance to watch my newly purchased one, I sure it will be a good quality.  The movie is great for the whole family.  Especially for parents looking for ways to teach their children how NOT to be a raciest, or  think themselves &#34;better&#34; than anyone else.  The acting is great and true to life.<br />As far as the time it took to receive my DVD, it could have been better--BUT I DON&#34;T KNOW HOW!!!  I ordered it on a Monday, and received it 2 days later (Wednesday).
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|I stumbled across this album while reading about a performance at SXSW and got sucked in - some songs are better than others  but as a debut this album is musically very together. Mike Milosh's amazing falsetto and Robin Hanniblas slightly unexpected musical approach make this highly listenable. People have commented that it sounds like Sade - I disagree  - this sounds like Rhye...
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|This app is enough to get your heart pumping and if you need it just for a warm up if you're semi-fit, I think it's a great app.  It's good on the go if you just need to squeeze in 10min to work out.<br /><br />Pros:  very easy to use, no frill<br /><br />Cons:  Needs more exercise samples

B00A5IY1XY|1.0|I understand this is a classic that influenced many later movies.  Even as a casual movie watcher, I could see the influence it has on a wide range of later movies.  However, the pacing, acting, cinematography, etc. are too out-of-date for most day-to-day movie viewers.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|If I don't get into a book in the first few chapters I dont bother reading it. I go onto the next book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|My wife was looking for some sci fi for her Kindle, and somehow came across this - I think it was because the first one was free. Well, it didn't take her long to come over and buy the rest of the story. It took me a while to pick it up, but once I started I had a hard time putting it down to do other things, as I just wanted to read just a bit more to see what would happen -<br />I think the story was very interesting, and the author did a good job writing it. His style is more conversational than lecture, and I enjoyed it all. Now I'm back looking for more of his books.
0802473156|5.0|I got this for my wife and she said it was 1 of the best she has ever read,great read.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Could not put it down. Fantastic read. He went a little overboard with some of the references and throw-backs, but without them I don't think they story would have been the same.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Fresh writing, good stories, great acting/directing... this series is fun and well done.  I make it a point to record, if I'm not home to watch.  5 stars!

B00280LYHS|5.0|There isn't any blood and gory details. When someone is killed they just die. Makes this a book I let my grandchildren read.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|The story drags yet it tries to keep you artificially on pins and needles every page. It is historically inaccurate to a crazy degree (though it doesn't claim to be nonfiction-geesh I would like it to be somewhat realistic, logical.  It doesn't make any sense, it doesn't add up.  I finally gave up on it, and then when I read about the author's background it all made sense.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 was by far the best.  All the characters are so intriguing.  I am anxiously waiting for Season 4.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|i can't put this one down - i've never been hooked on a game like this before - i would highly recommend this for the price
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 was very good.  I just love this series and could watch them over and over.  Highly recommend it!
B007P06DJK|3.0|This DVD would be rated at 5 stars if it was the edited version I saw on TV without the two F words in it. I bought it with the intent to use it as an educational tool for my jr. high general music class and bands but can't do that without having to be right by the computer at a specific point to edit some swear words. Great documentary about the music I grew up with though and I will definitely watch it on my own several more times, just disappointed I can't readily use it for its original intent.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Captured my imagination immediately. Filled me with surprise, fear, anger and hope. If you like a plot you are not expecting this is a book for you.

B00004RF9I|2.0|This movie was offered as a Widescreen version -- I checked carefully before purchasing.<br />What arrived was a poor-quality  3x4 aspect ratio DVD -- not at all what was offered.<br /><br />BEWARE that Amazon often offers one type or quality version version -- and delivers a lower quality substitute.<br /><br />The great movie deserves the full impact of a Widescreen version, which I will purchase elsewhere.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I was hoping for a danceable cd like his previous cd. But this cd has long versions of songs that range from danceable to hip hop etc.  Overall it was disappointing  I had hoped for some serious dance tunes Like Sexy Back
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I almost cried at the end knowing it was my last 24 episode.  I've seen all 8th seasons and I would rank this in the top 4.  One of those things you hate to see come to and end.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|I wasn't a real fan of David in the Ziggy  Stardust years. But was a huge fan in the Let's Dance years. This cd is disappointment. I had hoped for a new more top 40 type approach on this cd.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Predictable, boring, another sappy Nicholas Sparks novel. Not my favorite. It's just &#34;The Notebook&#34; in reverse. I heard this book was supposed to be &#34;award winning&#34; and got such great reviews, I thought I'd give him another chance...learned my lesson.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Wish it wouldn't have been cancelled! The pace of the show really picked up in Seasons 3 & 4 and got exciting.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I don't know what to make of this book. Let's see if I can deconstruct why I liked it so much.  The set up grabbed me because of its ordinariness: a family with two grown daughters is struggling in a poor economy and one of the daughters, (the one no one has faith in) gets a weird job that will save the others from slipping into poverty.  Oh, and it takes place in a small English village which raises the interest level for American readers by a hundred.<br /><br />As in life, the likeability factor played a big part in my total interest in the outcome.<br />Did you notice I said \\"total\\" interest?  I wanted to get back to my reading and I became lonely when it was about to end.  Yes, lonely.  The major and minor characters were endearing and when unlikely events began to infiltrate and better their lives it was within parameters that were believable and satisfying, not life changing (although life did change as it always does).  The last part of my deconstruct has to do with what we call a \\"love story\\" and how we yearn for someone right along with the main character.  I yearned right along with Louisa Clark and that's as much as one can ask for in a book.
1476715904|5.0|~Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />\\"I'm starting to see Colleen Hoover in the light of master storyteller of emotions because that's my biggest draw to her stories.  They pull at the strings of my heart until it feels drained and run over by the end of the book, but also with a sense of happiness and satisfaction.\\" ~Under the Covers<br /><br />SLAMMED was a book that crept up on me and took hold of my heart.  Starting off with a simple enough story, heroine who just lost her father moves to a new town with her mom and brother to start a new life, while finishing high school.  Girl then meets cute boy, they fall in love and then WHAM!  A whole lot of unexpected happens.<br /><br />First let me just say how much I enjoyed the slamming concept.  Never heard of this, but I love poetry and the slamming was just a take charge spoken word that I found immensely powerful.  Many of the characters in this book open up through slamming and it often brought tears to my eyes.  The author did an AMAZING job at conveying all their pain and hurt, their life stories, through such simple yet powerful words.<br /><br />And then there's the fact that this isn't just a simple romance between two young kids.  Because lets face it, they are younger than I like to read about.  But both Will and Layken are very mature for their age.  They've gone through immense loss in their lives and had to face responsibilities early on, that other kids wouldn't know anything about.<br /><br />Aside from being a great life story though, that takes us through some hard adversities they had to face, this was also a story of love.  Will and Layken are perfect for each other, but circumstances keep them apart.  They both do what's right, which is not often seen lately in books in this genre.  It just made me respect both of them more.  But I also liked to see them fall apart in each others' arms and be each others' support.<br /><br />I have to admit I probably spent the last 20 minutes of this audiobook crying my eyeballs out.  The subject of losing a parent hits home for me and watching them face that undefeatable end was a hard topic to read about.  The author again does an amazing job at pulling the readers emotions along with everything her characters are feeling.  I'm starting to see Colleen Hoover in the light of master storyteller of emotions because that's my biggest draw to her stories.

The subject of losing a parent hits home for me and watching them face that undefeatable end was a hard topic to read about.  The author again does an amazing job at pulling the readers emotions along with everything her characters are feeling.  I'm starting to see Colleen Hoover in the light of master storyteller of emotions because that's my biggest draw to her stories.  They pull at the strings of my heart until it feels drained and run over by the end of the book, but also with a sense of happiness and satisfaction.<br /><br />Even though SLAMMED is not left on a cliffhanger, there is a second part to this book that I need to get to soon.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I must admit I am not the romance lovey novel type, but this novel was corky and worth the dreamy wannabes. I kept finding myself wanting to be that girl, and that's always a good feeling when enjoying a book. It was not your classic romance novel, and for that I say it is worth your time to check it out. Enjoy ladies.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great historical reference and comparison throughout. Incredible character development from the first episode of season 1 into the last of season 2, so far (season 3 has yet to be released). I use it for home school in comparison to the history of mankind and what we have done in the past. The only con is an occasional one-liner that may be a little cheesy, but great none-the-less!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Stargate series.<br /><br />I became enthralled with the series from its conception and find myself re-watching episodes over and over. Atlantis and Universe are also excellent series however the SG-1 series is a step above the rest, that goes for the entire show Season 6 included.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is one of his best books in the series. I just love this series. Theodore Boone Kid Lawyer.<br /><br />-Chloe
B00004RF8J|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid and singing along. Now that I am 24, I find myself doing the same thing. Every character in here is lovable. My favorite of all is the Elvis wannabe dentist. I'm guessing every fan knows his dentist song by heart and all the moves and punches lol. Ok, so this is a musical about a guy who finds a \\"weird and unusual\\" plant that ends up having a thirst for blood! Romance, action, comedy! Whatever you are in the mood for, it's there! After watching this a few times, you too can put on your own broadway musical in your very own living room. Bring your kids, bring your friends, heck, bring grandma to the most amazing story ever!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Consistent as always, cleverly plotted, thorough. Always a loose end, just so you'll read the next one, but good, vintage Bosch.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|There arent any problems with this app that i can tell. It works just like on my Smart phone. Go ahead and get it :D
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really loved this book.  I never read a book more than once but I just finished this for the 2nd time (and I'm sure it won't be the last).  I find sociopaths scary but fascinating and Amy was both.  Well written; kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end (and then some)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is the BEST sound app! I can't believe it was free. I can mix sounds together or one at a time. How it is set up is unique too.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This show is about as addictive as they come.  Well written, well acted, well directed.  This is TV as good as it gets.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't wait for the next episode!  It keeps my attention and is really the only show I'm good on right now.
1594487154|5.0|D Pink has written some great ones (Drive, Whole New Mind) - this book sets a new benchmark in explaining why the stuff in the book is important, telling you how to break it down and then giving you stories and tips on how to improve your persuasion.  Be it your family, colleagues, friends or the hostess at your favorite restaurant - this book is written for everyone.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|This is a wonderful story about a humble, talented poet/singer-songwriter who was never heard of in the USA. His music and lyrics are on the level with the likes of Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Simon & Garfunkel. I highly recommend this film to anyone who grew up in the 60's-70's, I guarantee you will love it too! Thanks to the people who brought this lovely story to light, I absolutely loved it!
B007XF4J70|5.0|It's been a while since I watched Casablanca and I had forgotten how beautifully crafted it was, and especially how many absolutely classic lines it contains.<br /><br />And the Blu-Ray transfer absolutely does it justice. The picture is as perfect as you could ever expect from a movie made 70 years ago.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Bizarre plot, horrible language, weak ending. Do not read, and if you do, don't pay for it. I regret reading this book.
B00441GYZQ|5.0|Harrison Ford is a cop and the betrayed husband. Kristin Scott Thomas is a congresswoman and the betrayed wife.<br />Neither of them is aware of the spousal cheating until there is a plane crash at the beginning of the film. Ford and Thomas have never met. When Ford realizes that his wife booked a seat on the doomed plane, yet there is no mention of her on the manifest, he knows the fear of a husband who dreads the truth. The airlines keeps telling him his wife was not on any of their planes. He is sure that she was (being a cop and all). The congresswoman's husband told her he was flying to New York, but the airlines has his wallet from their downed plane in the Chesapeake Bay that was headed to Miami.<br />Ford gets a copy of the manifest and starts circling suspicious couples and where they sat on the plane.<br />His search for his wife and what he now realizes is a man she was most likely having an affair with, becomes a thrilling search for clue after clue. When Ford finally confronts Thomas that her husband was having an affair with Ford's wife, she doesn't want to discuss it. \\"It's over,\\" she says. \\"He's through with her; she's through with him; and we're through with both of them.\\"<br />At the same time, there are two sub-plots happening with Ford working in Internal Affairs trying to nail a bad cop, and Thomas trying to win an election in spite of her husband's death. Finally, the two trade information and near the end run off to the country to heal their wounds by turning to each other.<br />This was Sydney Pollack's last Directorial effort. I have always thought he was a genius, having directed Out of Africa, The Way We Were, Tootsie, and so many other great films. I personally think this film is brilliant. Mr.Pollack delves into the feelings of rage and anger that surface as the two betrayed people learn more and more about their spouses. Things they never knew, never had a clue. Discovering how blind they had been is brought to the screen with so much subtlety,it digs at the strongest emotions in our hearts. There is a certain suspense throughout the film that kept me riveted. Two people, strangers, alone, and tortured by a truth that tries to undo them. See for yourself how they survive this tragedy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it I would solo recommend this app although its not quite different from the first temple run its still great.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesome game. Tons of fun. Old school with some now twists. Perfect for casual games. Absolutely nothing .top complain about with this one.
B009FZFONO|3.0|The story development this season is way to slow. I am starting to loose interest in the this series. There needs to be more action.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Well put together. Great story. Really made you think deeply about life, religion, and most importantly the will to survive.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The actors look very much like the real people. I wasn't alive for the actual conflict, but it was an engaging movie that kept you on your toes and really excited to find out how it ends. I loved it and would watch it again in a heartbeat!
B0076HNMU0|5.0|...with a cup of deep black joe. A truly ground-breaking television series. Just one negative point:  this show gives me a wicked craving for donuts.
0345803507|5.0|This book brought the whole series together.  I am looking forward to seeing the upcoming movie that I hear is being made
B009S33I68|5.0|I haven't read many books on Nam, and l didn't serve there.  So as a retiree I found this book very gripping.  I could not put it down.  I'm glad that I read it.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I previously owned this movie but have since lost it. I loved this movie because it is not only a thriller but also a love story
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book.  Very quick read.  Couldn't put it down just as all the other Nicholas Sparks books I have read.
0345803493|5.0|This answered questions I had from book number one.  It made me want to read the next in the series immediately after finishing the first one.
B00BGICG5W|5.0|Seems like this was written about me and my wife very good movie very funny and brilliant for married people or couples
B00457WZEI|5.0|This was a great well written book.  I went to the movie and it was presented with little vairation to the book.  The movie was awesome.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I enjoy every episode of Mad Men.<br />I had not watched a 'series' be it drama, humorous etc, etc for at least 15 years or more on TV.<br />However, when I seen the first ever episode of Mad Men, I was absolutely hooked!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Amm nam nam yummy^_^.....btw Awesome app love to eat turtles :p<br />I also like 2 jump over islands... not easy I only did It twice
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I try to download the free app of the day almost every day so by now I've accumulated a lot of games but this is one I always come back to. As well as being my favorite game, it's also one of the most professional looking - it's hard to believe it's only $.99. It takes up a lot of space though.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I normally prefer action movies. With that being said I would recommend this movie.  Visulals were great. The story was entertaining. The movie seemed slow at times, but not like Castaway.
B00ANY94A0|4.0|They love to take these little sets apart and put them back together in different ways.  The little books that come with suggest 1 alternative; after that their imaginations take over.  Wow!  There are endless possibilities; mixing sets together, etc.
B00BF124PC|5.0|We saw this movie right when it came out in the theaters! I went in not expecting much and left saying I already knew I was going to purchase the movie when it came out. This is one of my all time favorite movies! It keeps your attention from the very first minute to the very last. You don't even realize its over two hours long! When it's over you want more, cause its that good! You learn so much they kept out of the media, very informative. I can't say enough good things about the movie! Just watch it, you'll be amazed, too!
B00ANY7V8M|4.0|Cats, puppies, turtles, rabbits, etc.; the granddaughters are having a ball.  Wanting more and more 'Friends'.  Legos, please make more of these little additions to the 'Friends'.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I love these tools and the colors brighten up my kitchen.  I have had lots of compliments from dinner guest.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Just like my students, I love Rick Riordan's writing!  This Roman series is fabulous and so is the Greek series.  I would highly recommend both!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Listen. I have a little flashlight on my keychain and it stopped working. So I downloaded this app. And I use it all the tine. It is really neat
B001XUPD94|4.0|Yes, the crew really hams it up in this one, but overall, the comedy works, the story is more plausible than many of the other TREKs, and the chemistry is as strong as ever.  Loved Uhura singing and dancing in the moonlight!  This might be the movie that dodged the &#34;odd number curse.&#34;  Trekkies will know what I mean, though, of course, not all will agree!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show worth paying for! i still need to type stuff here or i cant hit submit wow
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I can hardly contain my love for this book, Beautiful Disaster was one of my first ten books on my kindle and without a doubt the most read. If it was a paperback the pages would be falling out, yes this has happened to me don't judge! I honestly may need help with my love for Travis, I may or may not have stop in the middle of a park to text a friend that Travis just walked by me and she may have text back that would be impossible since he was working out in her gym! Is that odd, if so I won't mention our time on pinterest looking for him or our emails & texts back and forth with anything relating to him, including the count down to his book, Walking Disaster!! (10 days) This book has everything I love, bad boy check, funny friends check, boy chasing girl and girl not falling all over herself for him! It was also refreshing that he wasn't a billionaire or controlling (don't get me wrong love me some rich alpha males but this was a great change). Did I mention he is a fighter, swoon! Really I can just come by and read the book with you, I really don't mind! I guess I should also say that I love Abby, or Pigeon as Travis calls her. I really wish I didn't because I'd like to keep Travis for myself but Pigeon won me over with her feisty personality. Now I think you should all go read this book, and get lost with Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox  as Abby tries not to blur the lines around their friendship. And hurry 10 days, 10 day til we get the book I am dying to get my hands on Travis Story Walking Disaster!!!! April 2, 2013 Go Go Do Not Walk, you will not regret it but remember I called dibs on Travis!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So not every book can be brilliant and not every book can be moving! I find Colleen Hoover's books are! She not only writes outside the box but she truly touches your soul with her books! If you have not read one of her books you really must! Her stories breath and grow, it really is amazing!<br /><br />Hopeless is a great example, from the very first chapter I was intrigued. I had to know what possible could result in that reaction. I mean I felt the pain and felt like I was standing there watching Sky melt down and Dean Holder (swoon) telling her she has to leave. Of course this is a rare introduction to the main characters, but if anyone can make it work its Colleen!  So by this point I know my kids will be lucky to get feed, til I've finished this book. I just have to know Sky and Holder, I mean they need me! And I really needed them! So I started on the journey of getting to know this smart, sassy 17 year old Sky who rebels by baking cookies and trying desperately to piece together Dean's secrets! What I found was a breath taking boy with so much heart & soul and a funny, sad, touching love stories with a secret bigger then life!  I loved this book and really hope you read it! And when your done don't miss out Holder bonus scene
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didn't like it as well as the first two  books but was still a good read. I suppose you either like the series or not.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I was very disappointed in this movie. As usual, Hollywood has no idea how to make a movie about the CIA, or any other large organization. &#34;Focus on the individual and puff up the internal conflict&#34; seems to be all they know how to do.  And explosions, explosions are good of course. The script leaves me with no idea of what parts of the story are true and what parts are the writers' fantasy.  Guess I'll have to read the book.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie. My expectations were low, but it had me totally caught up. I haven't read the Judge Dredd comics, but this definitely felt like a comic book story. And I mean that in the best possible way. Simple story, presented with action graphics. And it was very graphic.
B00820N2JG|4.0|If you love Southpark you will love this movie. The puppet animation is one of a kind. You will be singing the team song all day.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I used to love movies and gore, since having my son I don't tolerate them well. This series has sucked my husband and I in and we watched all of the seasons in a few days.
0345536886|5.0|I would imagine that some film producer would buy the rights of this book and make a movie. I was giggling into the story of David when he entered the Finley and Fig flaw firm and say \\" I love this place\\". Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and some of the Saturday Night Live guys would be best playing the roles of Oscar and Wally while David should be Ben Stiller. It is so hilarious to imagine lawyers stop doing when ambulance passed by and the wacky scene of David chasing another lawyer.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|At times nailed the book down perfectly, and yet deviated in some ways to present a fuller picture...Not sure how I feel about Azog being in the wrong place and time but eager to see this journey fulfilled. Well done!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a good book--I'm in my fortys and enjoyed it although it is probably written more for late teens/20's.  Its an easy read and  I liked the characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One of my favourite games on my kindle! The graphics are amazing, and even though gems are hard to get, the game is still very fun.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|A very well done adaptation of one of Jane Austen's favorite stories.  The scenery and costumes are simply delgihtful! A must see!
B004RL9T50|5.0|This movie is just delightful!  A fun movie for adults and children alike with clever dialogue and humorous &#34;hero&#34; situations that will make you laugh outloud!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|What a cute movie!  Clever characters and exciting adventures will make you fall in love with this delightful fairytale!  Wonderful!
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My daughter, also named Sofia, loves this movie and the series also.  She sings along and wants to watch the episodes over and over.  Not too bad of animation and tries to teach a good moral with each story.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Like the Walking Dead, the writers of this show are full of surprises.  Just when you thought the plot couldn't get any more wild, there they go.  This is a great series!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Well developed characters and plot- very enjoyable book about a white indentured servant living with African American slaves during the 19th  century.
B005IT0V8O|4.0|This is a helpful and good reference book for the writer.  It is small but an easy, quick book to look up a proper grammatical use.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching this show sometime in the second season. Going back and catching up with Season 1 has been very entertaining.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The only problem I have with it is the repetition of hidden objects. I think I have looked for the same bell a hundred times in the same hidden object scene. The \\"friends\\" thing works great unlike Game Insight's other similar game Paradise Island. The interface is broken in that one and you can't get friends even though you need them.
B007C94QRK|5.0|A fantastic modern day revamp that will delight new fans and please old ones. Jason Segel has the perfect combination of goofy humor and heart warming innocence. The music alone is enough to get anyone dancing, &#34;Man or A Muppet&#34; a powerful rock ballad sung as a duet between Segel and his muppet brother Walter, won a well deserved Oscar. Don't hesitate to watch this movie, you will enjoy it.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I selected this book based on a friend's recommendation. It is not suspenseful in that it was easy to detect the plot and outcome; however the prose is so engaging that you don't mind.
B00A856U7O|5.0|Great CD and quality! arrived fast and in great condition, made a good Xmas gift for a friend who is a big fan
0425252868|5.0|I finished the book with tears streaming down my face.  What a great story...I couldn't put it down.  Franz passed away while I was serving in the Air Force in 2008.  Thank you for writing this book.
B00BF11STU|5.0|SHOWS THE BEHIND THE SCENES OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO DO TO GET THEIR MAN. I FIND IT INTERESTING HOW ONE PERSON NEVER GAVE UP TO GET THE JOB DONE.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome Book!!  E L James is a great writer.  All three books kept my mind in oz.  A good read for all ages.  Kudos!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun and can be played without buying more coins but it's more fun if you do. Take advantage of the 50% off deal when they offer it for the best deal.
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|I enjoyed the woven tales of the rich characters and their influence on each other. It was also an interesting glimpse into NYC in the 70s.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautiful love story and very educational on what quadriplegics deal with and what is involved caring for them.  I think this<br />would make a wonderful movie and it is written for a sequel.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|The first two episodes do not do justice to the rest of excellent series.  So bear with it.  If you enjoy Dowton Abbey, you will also love this forerunner to it.
0316017922|4.0|I recommend the book due to the quick, easy read, the engaging stories, and the interesting theory.  I felt that the author undervalued the important ingredients of abnormal hard work, dedication, genetic ability, and being of a singular mind that all these outliers possess to take advantage of their good fate.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sparks books are always fun to read. He's very good at character development and this one had a nice twist at the end that I did not see coming.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|To have maps in your phone or in my case Lenovo Tablet, is really handy since one doesn't require an Internetr connection to see where you are. My tablet has a built in GPS module so I find this app to be very handy to use when I'm not in Wi-Fi range which is required for most other popular map apps!
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|The humor in this movie only is good if you are 10 years old or retarded.  A good movie in this genre will have both adults and children laughing (Monsters Inc, Toy Story, Shrek, etc).  Additionally the plot is pretty sub-par.  While I'm sure most children will like this movie, as an adult, I didn't.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|A really good page turner but quite predictable of the plot sometimes and a lot of wishful thinking rather than possibility in certain areas.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun and challenging at the same time.  If you're looking for a fun game with a little challenge get this game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far so good its alot of fun kind of easy but i just started playing hopefully it gets harder I love games like this and its fun like that it has little side quest
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who loves colors, and a fast paced game.<br />You have to pay attention because after you get into it your times runs out
B0064X7FVE|5.0|tho I have only had it 2 days, I am familiar with it before. I like Amazon app's for the pad..easy and convenient to use..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm 7 years old. This is my favorite game. It's like having a real horse!I play it all the time!
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Simply put, one of the best fantasy novels of the last 10 years. If you haven't read it yet, do yourself a favor and buy it right now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So full of passion and just plain out sex amazing book can not wait to read the next book awesome
B0058VW36U|5.0|I take back what i said because i actually love it!if you wait a while after you download it it works
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Love this book!! Going down as a favorite book of all time. And I see it staying there. Thank you Paulo Coelho brilliant work of art.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|everything was in perfect condition and i love the movie! it will never be as good as lord of the rings of course but i really did enjoy this! it should have more special features though :c but oh well.
0143034901|2.0|95 pages into Shadow of the Wind I gave up. I was expecting an exciting intellectual mystery, an evolving puzzle of relentless momentum. With 20% of the story gone, the author had revealed barely more than what jacket blurb tells--just a few names of characters who, presumably, would show up later. But when? Between the lack of action, the 2-dimesional characters and the whiny narrative voice i'd had enough. I realized that the sinister smoking man had been tailing the young hero for over 6 years and hadn't yet followed up on his threat. Nor had the youngster put much energy into his mission. So, I figured, if the characters in the novel don't care, why should I?<br /><br />I got more enjoyment from looking up the book's Barcelona locales on Google Maps and reminiscing about my experiences in that fantastic, fascinating city.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Visually spectactular and great story.<br />Would have been better if had rented a DVD or Blu-Ray Disc since they have CC needed by my deaf wife.<br />Rental movie media products provide CC, but CC not available with Amazon streaming movies.
0321885112|5.0|It has made a great addition to my library.  My kids pick it up again when they are working on projects to get more ideas from the sample Sketchups.  The drawings of characters was really helpful as it allows the kids and me to sketch quick scenes together.
0307346617|3.0|I sure tried to get into this book.....but had to put it down. I think the age of the readers needs to be younger than I, so will pass it to my granddaughter and see how she likes it!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|We loved Seasons 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey and bought Season 3 to complete our set of current DVDs for this show.  The story lines are still compelling but I feel like it has become a bit like a soap opera in that just as one crisis is ending the next has already begun.  (And I'm still mad that 2 main characters were killed off!)<br /><br />Still, I highly recommend the series because the attention to historical detail, the acting, costuming and story line are all excellent.  Maggie Smith's performance is tremendous.
9889979942|5.0|Embarking on a two-year quest to travel across China's 33 provinces and capturing photos of the very different faces of China, including all 56 minorities, Carter has produced a moving tribute to the Chinese people. It's easy to forget all the different Chinas that there are and this comprehensive book puts them all together in one place. And what a place it is! This book is well over 600 pages and includes more than 800 photographs. Carrying just a backpack and a digital camera, Carter achieves the impossible, portraying Chinese people and their environments as they go about their daily business, as they sleep on the streets or on park benches, as they farm the soil, as they fish, swim, party and protest.<br /><br />These are rare, wonderful photographs. In his introduction Carter writes, \\"The snapshots in this book are not works of art. I was too preoccupied with participating, with reveling in the moment to worry about perfection.\\" I have to disagree. These photos are works of art. One can only marvel at how intimate they are, how Carter managed to win the trust of his subjects, at how he captures them at the perfect moment, whether they are shooting an arrow or walking out of a coal mine or peeing on the sidewalk.<br /><br />As he says in his introduction, \\"Where I have been, you will be; what I have seen, you will see.\\" He visited one-third of all the cities and villages in China, so there's a lot to see. He captured the essence of every Chinese minority. And it's not just pictures. Each chapter begins with a beautifully written description of that chapter's region. These are not snips from Wikipedia or random web searches. The descriptions are as intimate as his snapshots. He writes, for example, of Heilongjiang.<br /><br />  \\"I never in my life felt colder than here on the top end of China. Pain is actually the sensation I most vividly recall. During the bus ride to Beijicun, China's northernmost village on the banks of the Amur River, two elderly Manchurian women sitting beside me couldn't help but notice this underdressed foreigner shivering uncontrollably.<br /><br />  Wrapping me in the People's Liberation Army coats, they held me close in their arms until we arrived, the warmth of Chinese hospitality radiating in China's least hospitable climate.\\"<br /><br />This book belongs on every Sinophile's shelf, or coffee table, or mantle -- anyplace where it is within easy reach. You will want to open it again and again.women sitting beside me couldn't help but notice this underdressed foreigner shivering uncontrollably.<br /><br />  Wrapping me in the People's Liberation Army coats, they held me close in their arms until we arrived, the warmth of Chinese hospitality radiating in China's least hospitable climate.\\"<br /><br />This book belongs on every Sinophile's shelf, or coffee table, or mantle -- anyplace where it is within easy reach.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Liked all the songs, but loved some of them which I play over and over.  Will buy more of her music.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Watch the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes and you've got the whole movie.  Way too drawn out....mind-numbingly slow.  Not the action, war-like show the previews lead you to believe.  All the action is in the last 15 minutes.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I loved this season with John Lithgow - he was creepy and Dexter finally got his man with so many twists along the way.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Bought this to take on vacation recently to transfer photos from my camera's memory card to my iPad every day. That way, if something happened to my memory card, or I lost my camera, I wouldn't lose all the photos from the entire trip. It worked great!
0553062182|1.0|At the middle of the book I felt like I should stop reading it (I read it from cover to cover) but since it had left me with a lot of bad feelings, I thought that maybe it would make me feel better later.<br /><br />It didn't. The last chapter made me have a hard cognitive dissonance and for the last days I've been feeling painfully aware of all the sensitivities I've always had.<br /><br />I feel really depressed because I had learned to handle my high sensitivity but now I'm noticing everything that bothers me again. It's like I've forgotten to deal with all the things I'd learned successfully to deal with.<br /><br />I feel that I harmed myself by reading this book, it's not what I needed or wanted, I just wanted to understand myself better.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|What else can I say. Ever since Yardbirds he seems to getting better and better. He's at his best with Rock and also great doing blues.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|while not perfect, it's a really riviting film version of the original Hugo novel - an involving production that is obviously bringing more fans to this wonderful musical<br />although there is no replacing live performance (thank goodness!) this treatment is stellar - all the voices are realistic and effective - of course they dont perform the same way stage voices do, but it's important to accept this as a film - in that it's very successful!
B004XQYBA2|3.0|Not so easy to use, but having 10000 different puzzles is pretty nice. Not sure I would have paid for it.
B0076DELIG|2.0|It was not up to Mr. Connelly's usual standard.  I was not very impressed.  I enjoyed his other books, but not this one.  The way Bosch solved the mystery was not realistic.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Pat is a great character. Totally believable and likable. Then the books becomes cliched, farfetched, and typical. Two mentally ill people find each other and fall in love (just like they do in every other book or movie that they appear in) while doing ridiculous things. And I could have done with about 25 pages less of football details (even though, yes, I get it that that is part of the story) and letters.
B000683VI4|5.0|One of best ever movie.<br /><br />In my humble opinion one of the best movie about real life without any exagerations
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had passed on it many times due to the title but finally read the excerpt and was hooked! A funny look at what it is like to behave exactly as you think rather than conform to society's norms.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome, but it is not as awesome as me. I think that it is a good game because it is all do everything kind of, I guess. it is super cool.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|So I feel like I'm missing something. Maybe Twitter isn't for me, or I need to explore more. However, I've clicked on all choices and links and still appears boring. Hmmm...
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I just could not get into this game.  It loaded well and I am sure many will like it.  Just not me.
B008B92U32|3.0|Funny app, but not too accurate. Need to be facing straight forward, and even then not straight. But funny !
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Downey and Law at it again, with Moriarty thrown in WOW!  This production with slow mo, costumes and photography is just great.  My wife and I love them.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Greatly enjoy Downton Abbey and look forward to each new season of this well written drama. Arrived quickly and I am very pleased with both the product and the shopping experience.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really good app,very useful would recommend.I have it on my Kindle Fire Hd,and have had no problems ,it seems to be very accurate .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first edition of this game was fun.  Temple Run 2, offers you to tilt your device, and the graphics are great. Addicting game Beware!!!  I play on my Kindle Fire, much bigger screen then iPhone.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|this game is fun at the beginning but then u run. out of lives and that's it the game is over do not download. this game
B005Q1W10A|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. Great story lines and depiction of the the World War II era.  Actors, setting, and costumes are great.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was so creative. Very ingenius the way he worked in so many childhood memories (if you grew up in the 80s). If you still remember getting an Atari 2600 on Christmas morning, you'll love this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awsome! I reccomend this game for anyone who likes horses. Great for any age. Really cool graphics.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is the story of someone who is born into a North Korean prison.  He has only seen cruelty, and has been treated like an animal from the time he was born. It may be possible to physically escape this horror but it is much more difficult to escape psychologically.<br /> It is also the story of North Korea, a place I know little about so it is also educational.  It is particularly interesting in light of the war mongering and threats going on in North Korea at this time.<br />A fascinating read that made me pay more attention to what is happening in this isolated state, and as well ponder the cruelty of man.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|At first I wasn't sure how I felt about it. I  didn't care for it but now I have grown to really like it.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|My boys and I didn't get to finish it at the movies last time cuz it was so long but we got to finish it this last time and my boys enjoyed every minute of it...
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I really love this. I love how when I download something I need to study I can highlight/underline and leave text or notes. It's also very user friendly.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|My family and I really enjoyed this movie.we especially enjoyed the part witht he tiger and him on the ocean. We would like to see more movies like this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accuweather has consistently provided me with the most accurate weather information for my area and the areas I travel in most often. I don't go anywhere without checking it and have the app on both my kindle and my cellphone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is the best of the trilogy.  I was heart sick at the end.  Don't know if I would has done it or not.
B00A757EFW|1.0|After just a short time, it interrupted my UNFINISHED game. The choice? Purchase full game or end to main menu.
0451418441|5.0|Monumental in size, in scope and execution, World Without End is an enthralling read that deserves all the superlatives it has gleaned. I'm only sorry it took me so long to get around to read it - it's been sitting on my library shelf for five years. Initially, I was daunted by its size. But once I'd read Pillars, I knew that it might be a thick book, but it would be a fast read, and it was, as Follett's story pulls you in and the pages seem to turn of their own volition.<br /><br />It spans the period 1327 to 1361, following the lives of four main characters, Gwenda, Caris, and the two brothers Merthin and Ralph. The saga begins with these four as children, witnessing a fight and a murder in the forest - an event that has far-reaching consequences. After 60 pages or so, we leap forward ten years and their separate lives begin to go in different directions. Both of Follett's main female characters are strong, gutsy - Caris is a splendid creation, heroic, brave, driven, saintly yet flawed. The two brothers are complete opposites, Merthin a pacifist and a builder, while Ralph a violent and a destructive seeker of power. Intertwined with these four are many other characters, rich and poor, simple and complex, cunning and humorous. The plotting is faultless, evidence of a master storyteller at his peak.<br /><br />Throughout, it's a believable depiction of the lives and times in this period, with the feudal system crushing ambition, the plague devastating swathes of the population, and politics of church and aristocracy vying for power and glory. By the end, I felt I'd lived with these characters and was sorry to leave (most) of them - no mean achievement for a writer after so many pages!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Soooooooo addicting! My grandson (4 years old) loves it, too!<br />He always has to bring his dad's tablet over when he visits because we fight over my kindle when we both want to play it.<br />.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|sound issues and frozen issues, make this game way more difficult. i have a kindle fire and i love this game. but the issues make me sad. :(
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Fun, fast-paced story that kept my attention from page 1. I couldn't put it down. The characters were likable and the storyline kept you guessing as to the answer. I would love to see this book turned into a movie one day!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is SO cool I love it and you can make anything you want to in creative. You can challange your self in survival.
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|I love it. It is a bit dark, but sounds great. Dave's voice is on target. I also have Violator (love it) and recently bought Ultra which I like also. To me, Dave is to Depeche Mode, what Jim Morrison was to the Doors and Michael Hutchence was to INXS. Their voices go with the bands, like a hand to a glove.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great free app that can become slightly addictive. Several of my friends/family had it so it became competitive to see who could get the best score.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|This was an odd bookk parts of it were very unusual. Overall I found it interesting and I learned some things but it was not the cooking book I expected
B00C1C2IRS|1.0|Suddenly I don't have a video library?  What's going on?  I want t watch this episode---but apparently, even though Amazon says I own a digital copy, I do not have a video library!  This...despite having dozens of videos in my digital library.<br /><br />I've sent several &#34;help&#34; emails but so far no reply.<br /><br />Very upsetting!!!!!  I thought this was a safe and secure way to have a digital library of videos.  Now I'm Questioning this.
B00BF11STU|2.0|How was this movie nominated or considered for Best Picture?  The movie was slow, boring, and not worth the hype or my time.
B00915G6MG|5.0|The only reason I have TV is to watch NCIS. I got tired of watching the rerun episodes out of order so I bought seasons 1-9 as a package deal.  Now I can spend time with Gibbs and the gang whenever I want, in the order that I want to see them. NCIS is the Nirvana of TV. Nothing else even come close. When I finish watching watching the first 9 seasons again I will be purchasing Season 10.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have always thoroughly enjoyed Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels.  (I always picture Jerry Orbach as Harry)  The Black Box is not the best Harry Bosch novel, but it was a good read.  I really liked the back drop of the LA riots as the beginning of this cold case.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I had read several of Grisham's books in the past and enjoyed them. Then they all kind of seemed the same. When our next pick in our bookclub was &#34;The Litagators,&#34; I wasn't hopeful. I really enjoyed it. It started out good, wained a little, then finished well. I would recommend this book. Grisham's fans, of course, won't be disappointed. But those of us who have strayed might be brought back into his snare.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is pretty amazing for the price.  You get a lot of knife, heavy and rugged.  The sheath isn't the best.  The plastic sheath has a secure retention, but the snap is used to keep the knife vertical by snapping around the handle.  The knife is so heavy that it MUST be snapped to remain vertical.  If not, the knife will twist near horizontal unless you have a thigh tie-down.  That's the only negative side to this great knife.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|What a great movie...knew Ann Hathaway had a wonderful voice, the surprise was how Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman were together...absolutely a perfect cast!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Hmmm, this book was so interesting. So happy him and Anna are engaged. But as to the ending, I knew Jack wouldn't go down without a fight. And I kind of figured he had something to do with Charlie tango.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|Great band with lots of talent.<br />This cd is full of really good songs! Every song  is special with its own style and story.<br />No repeating, really refreshing!
B00846WWVM|5.0|I like sprinkle it demands of you to use your brain, not a game where you are<br />Zoned out. You have to figure things out or your people loose their homes
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Loved it! It was creepy and fun has variety in the puzzles. Didnt like that i ha  to pay a dollar if i wanted to finish the story but  it was well worth it! I want a sequel!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Love this movie. So good! Best one since the Shawhannk redemption! Everyone should see despite the subtitles. Endearing/charming mix of 2 worlds
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|This series kept me excited to watch. It was like reading a book before bed each night and wanting to read just one more chapter.<br />The characters and plot are awesome. I really liked it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This suspenseful novel definately held my interest.  However, the ending was very dissatisfying and felt like a grab at a final plot twist whether it held true to the characters or not.
044024630X|3.0|We're as good as any Reacher novel. But this installment suffers the same fate as the other Child books I've read, in that there is one plot twist too many, one turn where you look up and say how did we get to this point? In my opinion most of his books would be better if he chopped off the last 20-30 pages. And not to spoil anything, but the ending in my mind wasn't satisfying at all. It was totally unbelievable in my mind that a officer in the US Army would even contemplate what he did. All that being said, this book was just ok for me, mostly good and mostly worth the time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Did not know how much I would enjoy this game when I downloaded it.  Now I spend more time on Flow Free than my other games. Really find some  levels very challenging.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|WONDERFUL --Characters so well drawn, qand their growth so real.  The social times -- an absolutely fascinating look at the evolution/revolution of those times.  We gain a new appreciation of the old mores and the cost of their abandonment contrasted with the values of the new.  In the 1960s our family saw first-hand the confusion of so many young folks who were still trying to find their place in society -- a problem compounded by the old &#34;elevens plus&#34; tests which aimed to help every youngster rise to his or her full potential.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I'd already had all of the Harry Potter movies on DVD, but I'd been thinking about getting them all on Blu-ray instead. While I was looking at complete sets, I found this one, an 11-disc version that was about $10 cheaper than the 8-disc version. I thought that this was a great deal, and it came in a timely fashion and everything works. Overall a great product.
B001GIUWSA|5.0|The timing is off, under produced, and very brilliant. I love everything about this album. Dark Globe is hauntingly beautiful.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|The product wasn't great. I found that having already used a more advanced piano app on my iPod and iPad that this one seemed pretty lame in comparison.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best of the best. I can stay on this site for hours.  Great recipes, Beauty, Crafts, Art, etc... I have recommended this site to all my friends.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I had seen this movie in theaters and it was good enough that I had decided that I was going to buy it when it came out on DVD. When I was looking to buy it, the Blu-ray 3D and regular Blu-ray were the same price, and even though I don't have a 3D tv, I decided to get the 3D that also had the regular Blu-ray in it. Everything worked great and I'm very pleased. On a side note, it has been pointed out to me that this was a prequel to the Alien movies, and it does have a scene that would suggest this, but I don't know for sure yet if this is true.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|It might not be 'real life' for everyone, but many people will see bits of themselves (or their lives) in this film. It's funny and entertaining. If you liked 'The Switch', then you'll probably enjoy this. If you're looking for something akin to '40 Year Old Virgin', then this will sorely disappoint.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I enjoy this game its challenging and fun my 5 year old granbrighdson also enjoys it  the colors are bright the different ways to clear the board is exciting
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm a Tina Fey fan and I just loved this book so much that I bought the soft copy for my boyfriend to read and just to have on my book shelf.  I didn't want the book to end.  Tina's life stories are interesting and laugh out loud hilarious.
B005TKD512|4.0|The authors have come up with interesting concepts and have followed it up with good case studies. Though the idea of the rider and the elephant is not original, yet they have taken forward this concept to higher levels. Overall this is an interesting book to read and reflect.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I bought the movie fine. Then, I start watching the movie. THEN, it suddenly closed out and told me it is unavailable on instant due to rights. Well, it was available a second earlier. And now i spent $4 to find out that it is only available for download on PCs! I'm upset.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I like the game, it's easy to play but it does take a long time to save up money to by stuff
B00BM9WM2C|2.0|usually really like bon jovi but don't listen to every song they release just because they're bon jovi.  This is two albums in a row that I've been bitterly disappointed. I've read people's complaints that this album just doesn't rock, well it doesn't.  I don't mind Bon Jovi slowing down ( I really liked Lost Highway) but this album just isn't that good IMO. I'd take \\"That's What the Water Made Me\\" and flush the rest.  This album reminded me of Jon Bon Jovi's solo album a long time back (not Blaze of Glory - I like that one - but the other one - Destination Anywhere).<br /><br />Bottom Line- My advice spend your money on the recent Richie Sambora solo album (good album) instead of wasting it on this one.
B008D36INE|2.0|It was drag to watch it.  Not worth the time. I wish the reviews were helpful BUT obviously they weren't.
0765325950|4.0|This book was a satisfying conclusion to the epic story that is the wheel of time series. I could hardly put the book down once I got into it. It started out at full throttle action and kept up the pace the entire book...<br /><br />I almost found that it was too much fast paced action at times. After 400 action packed pages I was almost feeling overwhelmed by all that was going on. However what else is to be expected when there are over 10,000 pages of storyline leading up to the finale.<br /><br />I felt like there was a major change in this book regarding the strength of the channelers. It seemed like they were not capable of having nearly as large of an effect as in previous books. It also bothered me that the forces of the lights strength seemed like it was majorly down played. By my calculations the aiel alone should have been able to field a mimimum of 500,000 to as many as 1,000,000 spears(going from the number of spears fielded by as well as against the shaido). It seemed as if the entire marshaled forces of the light were around the 500,000-600,000 mark. There did not seem to be nearly enough channelers on their battlefields either.<br /><br />Aside from those gripes I was very satisfied with the end result of the book and series. For me there were many spine tingling moments. Many story lines were beautifully wrapped up, as well as many questions that left me wanting more. It was a bittersweet moment finishing this series that I have enjoyed so much for the last 12 years or so (aka nearly half my life thus far).
B0016BPWNM|5.0|My daughter loves this move and watches at any chance that she gets.  It is a great buy at the price.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I want to read the next one, but of course it is not out yet so I am so sad and stuff
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|I must admit, i never read any Nicholas Sparks book, but i only live about 3 hours from Southport , NC. and when i learned that Julianne Hough was going to be filming this movie, i read the book first. The book is so much better because you get to know Katie and you realize what she went through before coming to Southport. The movie spends almost no time on Katie's (Julianne Hough) backstory. There is scuffle at the beginning of the movie and she takes off on a bus and somehow winds up in NC. The actors that portray the characters do a really great job. There is a sex scene, but nothing is shown much, in the movie. But in the book , the two main characters are not in sexual relationship. So do not blame Nicholas Sparks for that, blame the movie scripwriter. The two characters in the book get to know each other over time, while the abusive husband tries to figure out where she went to . The book makes more sense, but the movie is decent because of Southport and Julianne and Josh Duhmel. Its a good flick and i will be buying when it comes out.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great book but the main characters outfits annoy me but at least it doesn't pretend that everybody these days doesn't have technology like cell phones and gps.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Is a great game to play when you want something to do that isn't trying, just relax and have fun.  Great game to play with kids.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|I was not really a Bon Jovi fan in the 80's like most people.  I never bought one of their albums until \\"Keep the Faith\\".  After listening to that record I went out and bought their back catalog.  I liked the singles on those older records but still thought they were just ok overall.  I really like the Faith record and since then I buy each new record upon release.  When I first heard \\"What About Now\\" I thought it was very redundant and kind of boring.  Now after repeated listenings I am really enjoying this album.  The mid-tempo songs are pretty good and that is my favorite genre of music.  The first track, \\"Because We Can\\" is very catchy and similar to \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\\" from the Faith record.  My only complaint with this song is the use of the word \\"soldier\\" right after \\"shoulder\\" and I think they should used \\"hero\\" or another similar word instead.  Second song \\"With You\\" is a little dark for my taste but still ok.  Title track \\"What About Now\\" is next and it is a solid mid-tempo rocker.  \\"Pictures with You\\" is another good mid-temp song and is followed by \\"Amen\\" a ballad very reminiscent of Leonard Cohen's song \\"Hallelujah\\" which has been done to death on American Idol. I'm not a ballad fan but this song is ok.  The rest of the album is mostly mid-temp songs and a couple more ballads.  My favorites are \\"That's what the Water Made Me\\"(I have no idea what he means by that-maybe baptism?), \\"Beautiful World\\" and \\"Army of One\\"-the only Desmond Child song on the record.  Child is one of my all time favorite songwriters and I sure wish JBJ would use him more.  I liked \\"The Circle\\" album as it had a couple really good songs like \\"..Follow\\" and \\"When we were Beautiful\\" but overall I like this record a little better.  One more negative is the lack of lyrics in the liner notes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|No time for hesitation...getting started on the final book! Oh yeah, and of course GREAT BOOK! Must Read!!! Get addicted! (Like I am)
B00BF11STU|4.0|I found this movie extremely interesting but had forgotten exactly how long it took us to get Bin Laden!  It is always sad that women and children are killed but remembering our losses puts it all in perspective.  Some of the constant using of certain words gave the movie no more credibility than if they hadn't- - what a shame we can't speak without using certain words a multitude of times in one sentence.  I felt the movie was well done and, once again, displayed our government unable to make up their minds.  Was surprised to not see the famous scene of President Obama, Hilliary Clinton and other dignitaries watching this final &#34;gottcha&#34; scene unfold.  All in all, as an expose, it did what it was supposed to do.  I would recommend it as somewhat of a documentary.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I WILL recommend this UTTERLY ENHANCING book to all those HOPELESS ROMANTICS. I am giving this book a five star rating not only because I found the book FASCINATING, but also because I have barely read one of the three book trilogy and I already know that this IS going to be a the TOP of my FAVORITE BOOKS list... ;)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is well-written and absorbing. I have not seen the movie, only the previews, and did not expect so complex a story. In fact I don't see how the movie could reveal the depths of Pat's character as well as the book does. This would make a great book club read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good clean famiily drama. Can't wait for Season four to come out, already done with season 3 on live TV
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is, without a doubt, now one of my most favorite books. It's told from the perspective of a snarky, sarcastic girl who loves to make self-deprecating jokes about the fact that she has cancer. Her personality is awesome... I totally wish that I could be her. Then she meets this gorgeous guy at a support group who is in remission, and they become really good friends and bond over their mutual love of novels and hilariously inappropriate humor.<br /><br />I was very surprised about where the book went from there. The quirkiness of the characters' personalities was maintained throughout the book, but there were parts that I read with tears streaming down my face, literally sobbing. While I'm definitely a \\"cryer\\" in real life and while watching movies or TV (and, embarrassingly, occasionally commercials), I can probably count on one hand the number of times that I've cried while reading a book. For some reason, it just barely ever happens with me. And it's never happened like this before. I mean, I was crying. The book was sad at points, but mostly I think that it just really resonated with me.<br /><br />I loved the main character and was able to feel a big connection with her throughout the book. Like her, I also love novels, am an only child, and love sarcasm. I also know what it is like to have a long-lasting condition that is a huge part of your life. When she was describing how it's like to constantly be in pain... I felt like I was listening to myself.<br /><br />The only thing that I could slightly criticize about this book was it's Perks of Being a Wallflower-itis. In that, the teenage characters in this novel were way more mature, smart, and witty than teenagers normally are in real life. While Perks of Being a Wallflower has no excuse (even though I still think it's an awesome book), I could almost kind of forgive John Green on this one. Maybe the characters were more mature because of their cancertastic-ness? Either way, I don't think that it took away from the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book. Five out of five stars, for sure.hat it took away from the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book. Five out of five stars, for sure.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Absolutely amazing!!! I love the story. The roller coaster the book is takes you on is perfect!! Not to much but just enough!!
0783240287|5.0|Wonderful music and acting. There are a variety of music styles. This movie has been tried over the years. Many schools have done this as a play. It was on Broadway for many years. It is good for all ages!!  Totally enjoyable. We watch it over & over.
B005S9ELY4|3.0|There is a great book by Stephen Hunter called \\"Hot Springs\\".  It is as if the people that wrote the screen play had just read this book and decided to copy parts of it verbatim, but leave out the good writing.  This movie is such a ripoff of Hunter's work, that I was just stunned that Hunter hasn't sued them.  Skip this movie, but read \\"Hot Springs\\".  If you like well written \\"action fiction\\" (I don't think this is a genre, but didn't know what else to call it...) then you owe it to yourself to check out Stephen Hunter's work.  One of his stories was turned into a lack-luster movie called \\"Shooter\\" (the book is \\"Point of Impact\\" - it is outstanding).  So, this movie? - a popcorn feature, amusing but nothing special.  Read the book I'm recommending instead.[[ASIN:1451627238 Hot Springs: A Novel (Earl Swagger)]]
B008220DIC|5.0|I was restless with this movie the first watch.  I couldn't understand what was great about it, what Paul Thomas Anderson was intending, what the goal was.  Still, through that first watching, I was completely gripped in some strange embrace, and I watched in horror of Joaquin Phoenix's character, not understanding why it seemed to reflect something so deep and so relevant to me.  I gave it a break.  A week later I came back to it, very intrigued to discover what I had missed.  It turned out that I had missed 90% of it in the first watch, as I often do with a really thoughtful film.  I don't mind making a comparison to Kubrick here.  As it turns out, and against my original judgement, this movie exceeds There Will Be Blood in provocation and, to me, in entertainment.  I know this sounds completely disagreeable, after all, TWBB is an ancient relic in film making even though it is new.  No one can really figure out how PT did it :-), unless you are a Master.<br /><br />PT Anderson does his best to reinvent character architypes in his films, and has taken it through the roof.  I think what people miss in the subtly of The Master is what PT did with characters.  There is no hero whatsoever.  There is no villian whatsoever.  There is no idealized character whatsoever.  There is no exaggerated character... whatsoever.  They are all imperfect.  They are all crazy, just like any given human.  In the context of this unprecedented (to my limited film knowlege) approach to characters with a major filmmaker, I could not fathom a more intriguing and unusual approach to character dynamics and story.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a great inspirational figure, but an imperfect one.  He channels great wisdom and glow for others, but cannot manage to face his own petty issues.  This is a famous, or infamous tale in history, and far from one you would think of to make a leading character :-)  Joaquin Phoenix plays the beast within men basically.  Anyone who has ever wandered in darkthought, or has been traumatized, or had their mind partly wrecked by some force or other can relate to this character.  Maybe Sigmund Freud would call him an Id?  (I'm no expert on that).  It was so painful to me to relate to this beast, to see how ugly it is.  And at first glance, I was unimpressed with the performance.  I judged the actor as an addict-type in his personal life, and thought his performance was not all that difficult for him.  Now when see it, I feel the depth and trueness of his performance, and am stunned as can be.  And there cannot be a better performance that Amy Adams has done in her career btw.  Each of the actors in the movie were surely as inspired by the director as they were trying to measure up to the director's previous film, and yeah, they brought this tale to life.<br /><br />Regardless, I believe in owning so few movies, I hardly believe in movies anymore, just not worth the time.  The 3 top new movies in my mind for a month now are Cloud Atlas, Life of Pi and The Master.  I recommend them.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really fun. It keeps you entertained and you don't want to stop playin<br />g. I would recomend this to anyone
1463514581|3.0|I liked the overall plot and the characters. However, Rose seemed a little too immature for a 24 year old. Her constant use of the phrase, \\"crappy doodles\\" quickly became annoying. I almost quit reading but did manage to finish the book. It was just OK.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Saw it in the theatre twice and knew (the first time) I would purchase it as soon as it was on the market!  Also saw the play two or three times and loved it.  The movie, however, brings you so close to the characters, the impact is even greater than the play.<br />It is so human, touching, inspiring, faith-based.  Highly recommend it.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Character development seemed to stop near the end of the first season. It became monster of the week rather than the relationships.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|It was okay, but after a few times, no longer allowed to use unless I spent for more of something. Did not want to.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Science fiction is usually my forte but this show has Maggie Smith. Beautifully done in every way - a pleasure to watch.
B00640Z0RI|5.0|If it is indeed true that the truth shall set you free, then everyone whose life was ever touched by the Vietnam War should read and believe this book.  It is, perhaps, the best book I have ever read on the Vietnam experience, no holds barred.  Our leadership was leadership in name only.  The waste and futility of the entire undertaking defies belief.  Want to know what really went down?  Read this magnificent book.
0525952926|5.0|Follett's books are always entertaining and well researched.  He makes the characters come to life. This is one of his best.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It was very interesting and any time I saw it I talked myself out of getting it. I finally did and wasn't disappointed

B002TZ3C8G|3.0|THIS STORY WAS GREAT AND AMUSING UNTIL THE CLOSE WHEN THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS BRAVED THE THE HURRICANE .THAT CONCLUSION WAS A LITTLE OVER DRAMATISED/  i LIKE THE JOHN COREY STYLE /.....REGARDS
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a very well researched, thorough, and fair-minded look at the complex nexus where race and medical ethics collide. It raised the important questions we as a nation need to ask ourselves on these issues without trying to offer simplistic or conveniently neat answers.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing that the man who wrote Glee also wrote this. This show keeps you on the edge of your seat, begging for more.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|This controller couldn't be any better than I expected ever since I bought the controller I've been playing my ps3. No dead zones, feels the same as a xbox 360 controller only difference is the back triggers but still best controller ever
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Wonderful casting, directing, and fantastic story lines. Very clear  and pictures. Jax and the rest of the characters are well written and perfectly cast.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a fun game. You can create your own worlds and you can name them!  You can even make a survival world or a creative world. Its a little hard to control at first, but once you start to play it more often, then you will get the hang of it. If I were you, i would get this app. It is extremely FUN! It has to be my second favorite app. I love it and thats why i gave it a five stars :)!
B006P0FICE|5.0|The movie is lovely! great actors, and a great director and cast. Great movie if you like musketeers indeed! :)

B00006F2WY|4.0|As a fan of Progressive Rock I'm always looking for more music listening pleasure.  If you are a fan of Progressive Rock and/or a fan of the 2nd lineup of Deep Purple you will like this cd.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Good game fair graphics. Would like to see more games like this. No foul language,no naked people this is a game my 11 year old will be able to play.
B00003INJ6|4.0|The first lineup of Deep Purple and their first album.  There were 2 more albums before the new lineup.  These 3 albums are underrated.
B0064U8GYC|5.0|I used this book as a refresher after being away from Java for a few years involved in PeopleSoft. It can definitely be used for beginners.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I purchased this movie on March 28, 2013 at 10:45 p.m.PST with 24 hours to review this film.  However, when I paused the movie at 8:15 p.m. on March 29th, 2013,  I was unable to resume the movie because the only entry available was<br />&#34;Remove from Watchlist&#34; which means I could not continue to watch the movie unless I wanted to purchase it again!  What time slot is Amazon Prime Movies using?  Obviously not Pacific Standard Time!!!  Please either refund the purchase price or open up the movie so that I can watch its conclusion.  Thank you
0399226907|5.0|This is a great classic book that my daughter loves for me to read to her. She really likes the pictures and the story.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|I have watched season 1,2,3 & am in the middle of season 4. I am captivated. I would recommend to all.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|We have several calculators in the house, but I like this one since my kindle is usually close at hand.  It seems to do all the functions I need.  Use it mainly when writing a lot of checks and don't want to tax my brain.  Since I worked mainly in accounts payable for many years, my math is very good, but on occasion like to double check.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|asowm game with the littol moncyes you  should get the game now<br /><br />car car car car car car car car car car car car car car car
B009UX2YAC|3.0|will be trying it again soon. Some directions would be helpful. Maybe I am just not that adept, but I play a number of games on my computer that I have to figure out and have had no problems with them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another amazing book by Nicholas Sparks. I love all his books and this one is just as amazing as the others.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|In most Mahjong games you have a certain number of moves, and when you reach a point when there are no more, the game ends.  The fact that the tiles re-shuffle really doesn't make it a legit game;  that being said, I still enjoy playing it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Enjoyed the book because I have always been a Bosch fan. However, I think that harry has run his course and it is time for a new character with harry making cameo appearances.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I have not played that this much, but it is just OK.  Maybe after I play it more and advance a bit I will enjoy it more.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is different and somewhat unique , it requires you to look at the puzzle from all sizes to complete it
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Makes it easy to download your Amazon music and play it. I've had no troubles at all. Trouble free app.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's solitare. The game works good but I downloaded it one day when I was bored. I deleted it after that. It was basically a time killer for me
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Super movie starring one of the best actors of all times. Drama at the highest level and very suspenseful. Highly recommend this movie.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I found myself really immersed in this book. It's a really good book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something new to read.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|After several years of use, my power cable began to slough off it's protective covering.  Not wanting to get shocked, I wrapped the bare wires with tape.  When the entire thing began to disintegrate, I could no longer use it to charge my Kindle.  However, lucky for me, I had purchased a Kindle for my husband's birthday.  We now have to share a cable to recharge.  I have never had this happen with any recharge device.  Not good
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love these cords. They're super long and I don't get yanked back if I forget I'm charging my phone while talking on it. These are the only cords I will ever buy!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Only 4 stars because it gets confusing sometimes. But the wide range of edting tools are worth it. Its so far the best pic editing app I have tried.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|This game is boring. I didn't even play that long because it just is that boring. They could have made it more fun.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I enjoy this game but I don't like the fact that although I have linked and relinked it to my Facebook account, all of the pictures of the friends I play with have turned to pencils.  Yes I do have the pay version.  I talked to Zynga in four different customer help requests and nothing has worked to change it back. I like the game but this is agitating anyway.  STILL DOES NOT WORK ON MY KINDLE, NEITHER DOES THE FULL BLOW PAID FOR VERSION. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY, TOO MANY ADS ON CELL PHONE ALSO. SLOW SLOW SLOW..!
B001AACEP8|4.0|I had to get this album since I had her other one. This are hilarious songs and I love every one of them!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Very enjoyable kind of like eating peanut butter before you exercise. Seems almost too much fun to be useful. It's brevity, Humor And concrete Advice Makes it a self proving piece of art work.
B0053O89WY|5.0|My favorite season so far! I love watching the extras on the dvds which I never watch on any other dvd.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Pretty much addicted to this show sinceI started watching it a couple of weeks ago. I would certainly recommend it.
B003CN5SAY|4.0|I loved Nip/Tuck but towards the end what the hell were they thinking? It was getting a little ridiculous. I was so disappointed with the final episode. What a drag. Either way though, I still enjoy Nip/Tuck
0399160450|4.0|Another in a long line of good books. Well developed plot that was not predictable. Entertained me fron front cover to back.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I like their songs, they don't sound like every other artist on the radio these days. They have a distinct voice and I love their songs. My favorite would have to be carry on.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I have devored every Kathy Reichs novel to date, and woudl love to read this one. For some reason, it refuses to DL to my Kindle. When it does, I'm sure it will be a fine as all the others.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry birds is awesome. I love playing this game and I get so frustrated when the pigs win! I never beat the game yet and I don't think I will since there are so many freaking levels now
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Yeah, it's fun...great graphics, good music, fun game play, fairly easy controls....it would be simply amazing if not for one thing. The time limit. I mean, thirty seconds is kind of pushing it. I've found no way to adjust, and for beginners like me, it's pretty difficult. You need to buy having time checkpoints around, and those are expensive upgrades. I couldn't really enjoy myself, because the gameplay felt too short. I recommend it if you're a pro at these type of games, but if you're anyone else, it might be a little difficult.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|I loved this song when it first came out but now it is very overplayed and I don't even want to hear it right now. Maybe in a few months I'll want to listen to it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|At first I thought it would be nothing special. Boy, was I wrong. It worked like a charm on my kindle fire. The first few levels were  easy, and I had fun as I connected  them smoothly. The later levels are challenging, and are what I consider flawless puzzles. Except. I had to take a star off because... well, it became boring. If you play it long enough, it starts to become mindless. However, I'm enjoying this app greatly, and I recommend it to everyone.
0345529057|5.0|This was a gift for a friend, who absolutely loves these books. She can't stop reading them and doesn't ever want to put the books down!
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Paulo Coelho is a very charismatic writer that I love!!<br />He speaks of true calling and awareness of your conscious and divine energy and feeds your soul with wonderful happiness,answering all the questions you might have and clearing every dough you might have,and leading you to find your true purpose if your path to happiness!!!!<br />Amazing....every time I read a book of his I reminded of my spiritual path towards kindness and love for myself and everyone around me...<br />Thank you!!
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love Ellen she's so funny!!!!! This a great book for any Ellen fan or anyone who loves to laugh!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My kids love this movie!! They love all Disney /Pixar films. I love the old video game references. We haven't watched in 3D yet, but I'm sure it will be great
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie Underwood is extremely talented and I can listen to her entire album and just hit repeat and listen to it all over again. I love blown away and good girl.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great performance by Jessica Chastain. She deserved an Oscar for her portrayal of the cool, logical CIA agent Maya, but too many good movies and this one was unfairly damned for being too political. Really showed the human side and costs behind the headlines. The effectiveness of the interrogation techniques was well demonstrated in the fine performance of Jason Clarke as the interrogator- his lines are quoted in enough reviews already. Jumping ahead to the Seal team and Bin Laden's execution-the best laid plans-SNAFU!-chopper crashes into OBL's compound and the team is left to their own reserves-unplanned, spontaneous, and successful. Got to see it!
B00899DR40|5.0|I'll admit, I have Bieber fever! Now that he actually sounds like a guy his songs are 1000x better. I'd get this album
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I have enjoyed what he has done with music for more than four decades. This latest collection shows he still has the touch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many amazing thing to make, bake or create. It saves me money, and I usually end up with a better product than I could have bought!!
1423140591|5.0|\\"The Son of Neptune\\" is the flipside of \\"The Lost Hero.\\" Jason Grace wound up at the Greek Camp Half-Blood, and Percy Jackson finds himself at the Roman Camp Jupiter. It gets a little confusing at times with so many Greek and Roman gods to keep up with. Never mind the countless number of characters (and their shifting relationships). Hazel emerged as my favorite character. Her story is so sad, and yet so uplifting. She and Frank make quite a couple. As Percy pulls together allies from Camp Jupiter, we anxiously await the arrival of Argo II and the other demigods from Camp Half-Blood.<br /><br />This book is definitely for the young adult set, but I think older readers will enjoy finding out what type of book kids today are happily reading for pleasure.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you love the Moody blues..If you love Justin..All I can simply  say..this album is a must have. And you will love it
0786860707|5.0|Whether just starting out or a seasoned animator, this is the book that will teach you all you need to know in understanding and creating 2D animation. It's second to none and use to sell for $500 in the  1990s.
B00A4YZWN2|4.0|This series is incredible, I fell in love with Lena and Alex from day one. A thrilling conclusion to the delirium trilogy. However I would have preferred  a  fuller ending, no figure out the rest for yourself.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|great music but I wish they included more and more of the music...all of it would have been nice.  I miss some of my favorites
B00005YIPM|3.0|recording quality and sound is good<br />the songs are quite ok too<br />but there are better sacds<br />But worth to have it
0062124293|5.0|My wife ordered it for her use. I heard from her that it is a very good book. Good choice.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the kids love to.play it. very adorable game. the game itself is free and you don't have to actually buy anything and its entertaining
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Such a great book with so many elements! Highly recommended story of love, suspense, hope,family, forgiveness, tragedy, and true connectedness.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids can't stop playing this game! It helped them with fluctuating their bodies as well eventhough this sounds strange.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love playing this game.....I am so addicted to it . I play all the time.<br />Great fun to pass the time
B009AMANBA|5.0|it was probably historically accurate as a movie goes.  all they have is what was written down.  i found the movie dark and moody.  i guess those were the times
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this app would be great except that it froze my kindle, and once i go past level 4 it would not let me back on the game. great idea but  didnt work. if they fix these kinks it would be a great game
B002CPMB9O|5.0|the vehicles were great to see in a period film.  densel washington played a believable character.  i thought the was great.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not all features work. Needs some updating but not to bad to kill some time. Needs a better way to receive diamonds and health rather than having to pay for them.
B008220D5K|5.0|it starts off at the beginning.  i loved the story and situations.  i had a fun time watching this.  great
B00873GRU4|5.0|wonderful  si-fi, slighly repedative & long, but so full of clever mental pictures of the content of the book, exciting read.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Such a great book! As a teenager, this book is really relatable and its really hits home. You'll laugh and cry and smile all at the same time. Extremely well written with a lot of emotional attachment included. Sometimes the thought processes are slightly confusing to follow but everything else  is fantastic!
B00AYQNOU8|4.0|It was easy to recognize most filming locations of the film, but the angles made it more dramatic.Highly recommend this film
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its a really fun game for bronies like me. Totally recomend it for everypony who like mlp and there cute adorableness
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|We saw the Hunger Games movie, and then I got the trilogy on Kindle. I was able to envision the players of the book by the actors in the film. I cried a couple of times while reading the books...not a bad thing! I was actually sad when I got to the end of the last book and it was all over.
B004TI5N38|5.0|An excellant read. The story moved quickly. This is not the first David Baldacci novel i've read and it didn't disappoint me either.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't believe that I didn't watch this along side of the rest of the world.  Once I started watching....I couldn't stop! Cannot wait until September!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and amazing it was kinda hard playing it the first time but it is like temple run.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This purple kindle fire hd standing case is Very good.....it gets the job done.....I carry it all around the house. I can sit it almost anywhere. When in standing position, the kindle won't slide, It remains right where you put it. I highly recommend this product.

1427215006|5.0|Background: Cinder is a cyborg adopted by a strange family in New Beijing. She is responsible for the family income now that her father has died of a plague that is ravaging the country. Cinder works as a mechanic, one of the best, for her stepmother and two stepsisters; until one day when the Prince shows up to have work done on an Android. Now Cinder is starting to lead two lives and she is not sure how to balance them...maybe she will just run away.<br /><br />Review: I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this book, yes I know almost everyone enjoyed it, but I am not really a sci-fi person and wasn't sure how I was going to feel about a childhood classic being made into a cyborg. I loved it, the story was unique compared to a normal Cinderella story. I think Cinder is strong and a great role model, not obsessing over a boy, but trying to protect her country and self.<br /><br />I found that it was hard to listen to the audiobook at times while I was at work, it almost stressed me out. I wanted to kill the stepmother and one of the sisters, and the Lunar Queen for all being rude and self centered and witchy with a B.<br /><br />Other than the fact that I wanted to kill these characters, Cinder, the Dr. and the Prince are all great to follow and I loved when they were all together in the story.<br /><br />The plot was interesting and I could see where they were going but the ending still surprised the heck outta me, so overall great read/listen.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|Good use of pop culture from many generations. Tedious at times, could flow together better. Relies on too many coincidences.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This game goes from easy to hard quickly but it will keep you challenged for quite a while.  Great game for free.
B000HEVALC|5.0|As others have pointed out, this is the best sounding and most complete version of this material available. The earlier bootlegs don't sound nearly as sharp as this version does. And the tracks are in the correct order, as this was Elvis' copy. The only downside is you wish there was a lot more. But this is fantastic. Can't recommend it enough.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Am very impressed with these newer features and easy - to - navigate menu and features.  From maps, charts, 10 day forecast, and various locations plus much more, AccuWeather app is great .... especially on my Kindle Fire.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This is not a movie about sushi.  It's a story about being dedicated and passionate about what you do, whether it's making sushi, working at an office, being a teacher, or sweeping floors.
B0026Q8F6C|5.0|Awesome awesomeness of the most awesome movie ever. Everyone of every age should watch this movie. Watch it now if you never have.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I just wish it could have been longer.  I highly recommend it for the hidden object adventurer.  Have fun!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|This book was a little difficult to get into, but worth the read. Some parts were very disturbing but domestic violence is disturbing, to say the least. Terrifying but realistic book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the haunting books about the Holocaust. The beauty of Markus' words is something that you just don't find often!
1401937268|5.0|I am in the process of obtaining my certification through Doreen and Radleigh. I have other Angel decks, but needed a tarot deck. I was amazed at the beauty of the cards and how they connected with my readings. They are perfect.
B007R21JJK|4.0|All in all, this motherboard is pretty nice. I like the 3D BIOS (although it is definitely unnecessary). The one recommendation I would give would be for anyone who buys DDR3-1600 RAM with it to go into the BIOS on first boot and turn on XMP. Otherwise, your RAM will be running at 1333 and not 1600.<br /><br />Had a weird issue where it kept saying the BIOS had been reset after installing a hard disk alongside my SSD, but it seems to have resolved itself.
B000B7QCKE|5.0|This music is so unique, it almost defies description.  Yanni is clearly a talented musician.  I love that he shares the stage with others by letting them have their solo material throughout the concert - so you really see the quality of the other musicians with which he has surrounded himself.  The music is so uplifting and captivating. An inspiring performance.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|It's Dark Side of the Moon.  I don't really need to add anything, do I? Besides five more words to this review, I mean...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. Everything Mark Owen said it would be. Makes my appreciate the truth to what Navy Seals are all about!
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Great plots.  Lots of twists.  Enjoyable characters.  It can get a bit gruesome at times, so it's not for smaller children at all.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|Since there is so little reviews for this game itself here is the truth of this game. The display and graphics is very good and gameplay is easy until you get farther into the game then it actually gets more and more difficult making it very addictive to me. I would say this using for young children but for people that actually are looking for something fun and challenging to play. All and all the game is fun and worth the dollar it asks for<br />.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very enjoyable plot.  Excellent musical score.  Characters are very likeable.  If you enjoyed video games in the 70's, you will get a kick out of several scenes.
B00B6QXN56|4.0|Great Item and Great Tunes love it, Suggest it to anyone who likes guitar music and blues. Make the purchase if you love good music
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It seems you have to be a Facebook member to get much out of this game. \\"Guests\\" do not fare well. It's free and it passes time nicely. Until you run out of Bs to play with. Also, I reported an issue of the treasure chests not opening. The response was pretty much contact us when you've had an issue that you spent real money on. I have not recommended it to anyone. Bingo Bash is much cooler IMO
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love learn to save boards have to come before characters especially daredevil scoot and other special boards. Once you get it you can not unupgrade
B007REV4T8|5.0|Good villain - some of the special effects a bit over-the-top, but this IS a Bond film. Wish they hadn't wrecked the old Aston (though the real car wasn't detroyed, of course.)  Very sad to see Judy Dench relinquish the role of 'M'.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|This is a great addition to anyone's CD library, if they like Joe Walsh.<br /><br />The title track, Analog Man, is a tribute to those of us that long wistfully for a simpler time, and our 78s, and is a good tune to boot. Wrecking ball is a lesson about life in the fast lane. The gem on this album, however; is the Band Played On. Joe Walsh meets Sargent Pepper...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is a great analogy of where we could be headed if we don't take the first steps to recognize what human life is worth and what our neighbor has to offer.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I bought this on a lark as I'd heard the band's name a few times, and it's one of the best metal albums I've ever picked up.  It's screamy so if you aren't into that it probably won't work for you, but it's got a bit more variation than most screamers I've got (more than say, Deviate, ha!)...just not enough to *not* be considered screamy.  Surprisingly, I think ITM's screams work better than most bands and Comanche is easily one of my all time favorite metal songs now.  There are very few tracks I don't really like here.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Shallow story-not up to the standard of previous DeMille novels.  It does illuminate Arab beliefs and practices, but nothing much happens until the end.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A rich story of Ireland full of poetic simile and metaphor. Another nail in the coffin of the Catholic church. Anyone with an Irish heritage or an interest in the people of Ireland should read this book for its social history.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Reveals how politically savvy Lincoln was.  Also amazing to note that the political process then parallels what happens today in political elections on the national level.  As a former social studies teacher in high school teacher I wish it had been available during my career-although no high school student would read such a long book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is an awesome way to waste time. love this game wish you could get diamonds lil easier tho.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|It keeps locking up on kindle, making timely searches impossible and causing scorched meals while waiting for unfrozen search app and reboot and restoring the device to where it was.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The movie Les Miserables is outstanding, however the Amazon streaming was slow and the picture somewhat distorted at times. I feel I should have received a hard copy for this price.
B0067R0APK|4.0|The app is handy and I like the widget and interface. Updating has taken the widget off my Nexus 7 homescreen though, but it was easy to put it back.
B00A1XIXM8|4.0|If you like Bad Religion then you will love this record.  I don't think it's quite as good as their last one, but it has started to grow on me.  I would not recommend this for a first album though.
B005R7FOPC|4.0|Pour ceux qui aiment une histoire qui se situe dans l'epoque en question (c, est a dire - avant la Revolution Française - 1789-1799), et qui aiment aussi un texte compliqué, et qui ont aussi un goût pour quelques profonds apercus dans l'esprit humain, c'est une bonne lecture.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The names of the chapters give away the ending, so don't look.<br />It was a very fun book to read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great book. I tend to read very slowly, most 300 page books take me more than a month (embarassing, I know). I finished this in 2 weeks - I could not put it down. The depth of character development put into even minor players is awesome. I think the serial nature of the books has a profound effect on the work - the author is not afraid to get rid of anyone.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|Overall, this is a pretty good album by Bruno Mars.<br />The album starts off with ‘Young Girls,’ and I absolutely love this song. Next is ‘Locked out of Heaven,’ which was one of the leading singles. Even though it is only about sex, it is still very catchy. ‘Gorillas’ has more of a primal and simple feeling, but a good beat that grew on me a lot. ‘Moonshine’ is decent song with an R&B feel, and I’m mentioning it in my review, which means I like it enough to write about it. ‘Treasure is actually the only song that I did not enjoy. “When I Was Your Man’ is very beautiful slow song. It really compliments the album and is my favorite song of the album. At first, ‘Natalie’ was not in my favorite 5 songs of the album, but it really grew on me and now it is one of my favorite Bruno Mars songs. It tells a story that I haven’t heard in music before, and the chord change in the last fourth of the song is delicious! ‘Show Me,’ yet another song with sexual implications; to me it gives off a cool tropical vibe. Now that I think about it, I like how much variety the album has, even with only ten songs. I love the synthesizers in ‘Money Makes Her Smile,’ and it’s got a catchy chorus that grew on me. ‘If I Knew’ makes a great conclusion to the 35-minute album, it has a similar feel to ‘If I Was Your Man.’<br />My favorite songs off Unorthodox Jukebox are Young Girls, Gorillas, When I Was Your Man, Natalie, and If I Knew.
B001L63O1E|5.0|I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this record until my recent purchase of it from Amazon. It is truly amazing and uplifting music from one of the most incredible rock bands of all time. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars and smiles all around for buried treasure enthusiasts!
B009FOBMBI|4.0|Transit of Venus by Three Days Grace starts off with a terrific set of three songs, but then the good songs are a bit more spread out. It is named so because there was a transit of Venus in 2012, in June I think. That's when Venus comes between the earth and the sun.  `Sign of the Times' is great, it's real great! `Chalk Outline is good as well, and it's the main single of the album. `The High Road' is for sure my favorite song of the album. The chorus is so addicting and I love everything else about it as well! In my opinion, the only part of `Operate' worth listening to is the guitar. It is a decent song to listen to when I haven't heard it in a while. The chorus of `Anonymous' just sounds like guitar slamming, drum bashing, and screaming. It's not a bad song, I'm just picky when it comes to rock music like Three Days Grace. `Misery Loves My Company' is one of my favorite TDG songs, it is great throughout the whole song. `Give In To Me,' originally by Michael Jackson, is a great song in general. Three Days Grace added some hard rock, and it works very well; I love it! `Give Me A Reason' and `Time That Remains' are not quite as hard rock as other songs, and I like them; they are in the better half of the songs. `Expections' grew on me, and now I like it. I probably don't give enough credit to `Broken Glass' as well as `Unbreakable Heart.' They are good songs, and I don't listen to them enough.<br />Maybe you got the impression that I only liked about a third of the album, because that's the impression that I had before I wrote this review. It's actually better than I thought it was, when I listened to it all the way through for the first time since I bought it. I don't regret buying it. Actually, my purchase of Transit of Venus convinced me to get One-X and Life Starts Now.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It had everything.....sex, love, intrigue, friendship, family love, redemption.  Those who think the sex was TOO MUCH....do not get it. There is so much more and it's truly a fast read...all three.
B008IEFP1E|4.0|It's a fantastic album!! The only songs I don't love are Beautiful Goodbye, Fortune Teller, and Kiss. My absolute favorite songs are One More Night, Payphone, The Man Who Never Lied, Lucky Strike, Doin' Dirt, and Wipe Your Eyes. This is a very good album. I've bought a lot of music recently, and this is one of my high recommendations.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This film is the reason that the Oscars need to add the category for  ensemble to their list.  I was so pleased that this movie won the best picture award for 2012.  It is worth watching over and over for all the little things. Do not miss it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I love Bond, and I am a fan of Daniel Craig. This movie was just okay, but I am not sorry that I bought it. If you are a fan of Bond and Daniel you will enjoy this movie. The action is ridiculously good.
0394818237|5.0|My six year old granddaughter has two Mommies and they are happy to have her exposed to women doing any job whatsoever.  Richard Scarry reworked this book after getting flack about how he presented females.  Not to be missed for any little one on your list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am having fun trying not to get killed by the train.  It is very challenging for a person my age.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|I first bought a knock off but soon realized cheap is cheap and returned it for a refund.<br /><br />This Nikon Unit features FULL weather seals, I don't know about you, but I need to know moisture is safely kept from entering inside the unit; sealed and protected just like your D800 is, Every seam battery compartment, and connector is weather sealed + you get the same rubber grips as the D800 NO cheap imitations.  Least we forget, the poly materials are all of NIKON quality just like the pro lens are made of + the name Nikon for your warranty.<br /><br />If you ever owned a knock off you always suspect failure at any minute - Nikon is a product I depend on and I don't mind spending extra for quality.<br /><br />You could also buy a cheap &#34;knock off&#34; camera but did you?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Keeps your interest from beginning to end. I was sad when I finished it.  I wanted it to keep going.
0679805273|5.0|This book is so insightful  on so many levels. It works for a graduation, a change in jobs, or any life changing<br />situation. I love it and I have gifted this book to many people over the years. Dr. Seuss is the master of words!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really enjoy the challange in overcoming the zombies.  If you enjoy a fighting challange this game is a good choice.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very enjoyable read!  Nice story, lots of emotion, gives us hope that things will be ok.  I definitely recommend it.
B004H6G0TI|1.0|Can't ducking click the install button cheap grimey prik. Couple more words to upload this information to the app creator
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very eye opening. This information affects every American who is concerned about what we eat and our health. I can appreciate any type of documentary that will make you want to learn more!
B008X8QCTO|1.0|I have tried repeatedly to download and/or install this game. It won't work. This is becoming increasingly frustrating &amp; entirely repetitive lately. What's the point of owning a kindle fire &amp; never being able to use it?
B000W061HE|5.0|Personally, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. It's full of great, well-written songs, with everything from guitar-driven tracks to ballads. This is a great album to buy if you're new to Whitesnake, or even a die-hard fan, and most definitely a classic.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app as it is easy to see when the kindle needs recharging.this is most useful as myself and my 10yr old use it mostly and games use more power so I can top up the power.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|The ease of use after finding the advanced settings makes getting through my feeds much quicker.  Has all necessary componants for saving or sharing.
0307887448|5.0|This has been on my to-read list for a while. After giving it to a couple friends for Christmas and having them rave about it I decided to pick it for book club. I recognize that this may not be a great book with grand ideas and stunning prose, but I can't remember enjoying a book this much in years. Yes, I am a nerd, but this book had appeal beyond it's geek factor. Cline tells a damn good story, and he does it so well that I did not want the book to end.<br />It is 2044, and the world has gone to hell in a hand-basket. There is widespread famine, poverty and disease. Wars break out on a fairly regular basis and the environment has been totally destroyed. Despite these conditions, nearly all of humanity spends all free time in a simulated universe called The Oasis. Kids go to school there, and the world economy functions on Oasis credits. When James Halliday, the creator and owner of the Oasis, dies with no heirs, he lays out in his will the rules for the ultimate video game. Crack the clues and complete the obstacles and you will win his vast fortune and control of the Oasis.<br />Wade Watts was 14 when the game started, and devotes his life to studying James Halliday and his obsession, the movies, games, music and books 1980's. When he clears the first obstacle he becomes a world wide sensation, and the target of the evil corporation that wants to take control of the Oasis, IOI.<br />Cline creates a fully imagined universe in the ultimate send-up of the 1980's and nerd culture in general. I grinned in glee when I recognized nods to favorite movies, tv shows and games. But he also used this opportunity to talk about how dependent society has become on technology, and our failure to connect in the real world. He opens the door for discussions about privacy, internet security, environmentalism, prejudices, and a multitude of other topics. And he does it all without being preachy. This is a fantastic read that I look forward to reading again and again. And I can't wait for his next book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This one will grip you and not let you go.  What you think might be a re-write of the Scott Peterson story will turn out to be something altogether different.
1400052181|5.0|The person that has had the single greatest affect on medical science in the last 100 years was an African American woman. Her name was Henrietta Lacks, and she died in 1951 from cervical cancer at the age of 30. Her cells were taken without her knowledge and without her consent, and nearly every medical advance that has been made since 1951 has come from working with her cells, which live on today.<br />This book tells the story of her short life, and it goes on to tell what happened to her family, who didn't find out about her cells until 20 years after her death. Ironically, her children can't afford health insurance. It also talks about the work that was done with her cells, and the advances that came from them. For me, the most interesting part was the vast array of legal and medical ethical issues that the author discusses.<br />There are some issues with the writing that I have a hard time pinpointing, and it is not an easy read, but the subject matter is so interesting that it overcomes the problems. Should be required reading in all medical schools and research institutions.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I fell in love with this book the moment I heard all the talk. Fifty shades is hot, steamy and sexy!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|You will not think that it will end well but they end up staying together after the terrible things happens to them. The older brother was his own man and stubborn. Keeps you intertained clear to the end. Wouldn't mind owning this one.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A good movie you cant go wrong.  It will give you a good feeling after you have viewed the movie.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Anyone who likes History will like or love this show. It has an interesting style to it. I would say stay away from this show if you do not like nudity and lots of blood.
B009ZQ7M1U|4.0|The movie shows what a mess the laws have made of education.  The teachers have there hands tided thanks for the few bad apples.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Fantastic and really fooled me for a while. I couldn't wait to start the next book. A very good read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is perfect for you if you enjoy survival strategy games or if you enjoy just building your own little world and having fun. 5 STARS
B000I55YU8|2.0|This is an average cops and thugs movie but with scenes in Japan. The movie is also very predictable. The acting is nothing to write home about. With so many better than average movies, this movie is worth giving a pass.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game. My kids love it and it has great graphics.  I would recommend it for anyone who loves My Little Pony.
B00A135YUW|4.0|Some of the songs are highly experimental like Yayo...i.e. they are not that good/polished.<br /><br />On the other hand, Gods & Monsters is quite possibly the best song Lana Del Rey has released during her short singing career.<br /><br />If you like Lana Del Rey a lot, definitely buy this EP. If not, go buy her Born To Die album and give that a whirl first.
B00BR476TG|5.0|I also was unsure about watching this movie but so glad that I did. The scenery was breathtaking and even at my age the lessons shown in this movie were heart warming and heart breaking. Told so eloquently and with such class and style. Everyone who needs a feel good movie should watch this one. Think I'll have to buy the DVD now so I can watch over and over again, especially when I get down.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Addictive! This show is just amazing. After the series arrived I was not available for two days! Now I can't wait to get season 3!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Cool concept for fans of Star Wars that also love angry birds. My son loves it!  As well as my boyfriend!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Though lengthy, I enjoyed every two hours and thirty minutes of this movie. If you have any interest in the life and legacy of Abraham Lincoln or the American struggle for abolition of slavery, watch this movie.
0547848412|1.0|I usually review books I really like, lending support to those searching for an interesting read. I am about to depart from my positive reviews. I found Life of Pi at my local library in the Audio CD format. I commute about 2 1/2 hours per day so I employ audio books to help pass the time.<br /><br />I had read a few good reviews of Life of Pi (much before the movie) so I checked it out. I was determined to get through it to see what had prompted the positive reviews. I must say that the 12 hours I spent on the road with Pi were the most boring that I've ever experienced. I can only conclude that the positive reviewers must have dozed off and dreamed something other than what I was hearing.<br /><br />I truly enjoy well-written literature, but in my humble opinion Pi is not in my top 2000 or so. I have come to the realization that there is not time for us to read all the books out there, so I regret the time wasted on Pi.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I loved  the movie. It kept you wondering what the little guy would be up to next. Had a good ending.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Just finished reading this book and it's like watching a great movie that makes you feel like you've left your own reality and are now living this book's reality, until you come back to real life. Such a great, sad book I wish wasn't over. Can't wait to see the movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Read it in one day. Can't wait for the next one! A few more days...yay!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I don't know how historically accurate this movie is (or if that really even matters) but I can say I was engaged and awed by the story, the costuming, the settings, and the acting. A lovely production in all ways possible.  Who knew Queen Victoria was so interesting? My only disappointment was that the movie didn't go further into her reign or life. I would have been happy to watch another hour or two in order to see that progression. Can't recall ever saying that about another movie!
B00634GHJA|5.0|This is probably one of the best and most used apps I have.  It is wonderful to be able to use it between home computer, kindle and phone.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I expected much more from this movie. I mean the graphics were great and the story line too, but its just missing something cant put my hand on it.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|this has to be one of the all time GREATS. I've viewed this film many times and will probably watch it again. HB, HUSTON, HOLT, AND THE BIT ACTORS WERE AWSOME. This movie proves you don't need all the bells and whistles in film today.not to say there are not some great actors & movies out there but c'mon folks. gotta go now. BUT MAKE SURE YOU VEIW TREASURE..........
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary contained all the words I've ever heard and then some. I didn't actually finish the dictionary I just over scrolled.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I have spent many in hospitals so have had lots of time to play. I have not had any problems with this app. and would recommend the game to.everyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I Love This Series. I hope she writes more. Christian is a lot of women's dream. The good thing is minus the wealth I have the dream husband!
B0084670FU|1.0|While the photography of the film was very good, the structure of the the movie was vague and slow to develop a point.  While some viewers might might enjoy  being strung along waiting for some plot to develop, I am not one of them.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|When I heard that this game came out, I was so excited! I had it for a couple of months and I love it. I especially like how they put Derpy (or Ditzy Doo) in the game, hiding in a box.
B0018STVHQ|2.0|Although I am fascinated by History and especially by the British History this movie is not what I was hoping it would.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really got sucked into this well-researched book. Weir's central character Mark Watney's tale of survival on Mars after being left behind after a supposedly fatal accident is engaging due to his &#34;can-do&#34; and smart-ass attitude. Everything that could go wrong almost does, but Watney's training as a botanist and mechanical engineer has him surviving and figuring out how to make until a rescue mission can come and get him.
B002EXGQO0|3.0|It is an OK movie - nothing to brag about.<br />Although this is a great period of the British History the movie does not fullfill the expectations you have.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is so fun, but seems to lag or glitch a lot. It is still fun though, although it is sometimes slow..
0618154043|5.0|If you loved LOTR and the Silmarillion (both are prerequisite reading), you'll love diving deeper into Middle Earth. This is basically a short-story collection, but like the title says, some of the stories aren't quite finished, and finish as just some collected notes. One of the more complete stories was actually complete enough to be published as a separate book (/The Children of Hurin/). There's some really interesting stuff about Gandalf and the other wizards, along with quite a bit concerning Numenor.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|What I loved about this movie was the way it expands on the story, depth, and background of both the original book and the Lord of the Ring movies. It may have lacked some of the 'grittiness' of LotR but, if you think about it, that is what keeps it true to the book. A great achievement that sets itself up really well for the next 2 films!
B0095P31L6|4.0|Good for the whole family, nice special effects, overall a well done movie that can be enjoyed at all ages (3+)
B0020BUWX2|5.0|The words towards the end were so touching!!! I loved the plot... but what happens???<br />I NEED TO READ THE NEXT BOOK
B004GHNIRK|5.0|How can you not love novel this for free! Excellent read, especially since the movie version recently came out on blue ray.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it shows me how much my kindle is charged and how much more charging it needs that's why it think its awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book - it felt very genuine and real to me. The characters are wonderfully written and the storyline is well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game you get to run on trains and run away from guards and overboard which I wish I could do in real life
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Over the top action from the get-go!  DC is amusing and sophisticated and self-contained, as his character should be.  Bardem is PERFECTLY PSYCHOPATHIC - what an actor!  Great escapist film!
B0095P29EG|4.0|Easy and enjoyable entertainment for the family. Mythology comes to life in modern day with feed-in to other films currently out.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|The characters are all unpleasant, PSH is (unfortunately) uncharismatic in his role, AA is poorly utilized, and JP istotally over the top!
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|British pop singer Dido returns after a five-year hiatus with her fourth studio album, [[ASIN:B00BWGL6BS Girl Who Got Away]], released via RCA.  Girl Who Got Away follows up 2008s underperforming [[ASIN:B001EO2UKO Safe Trip Home]], which was deemed favorable by many critics. Girl Who Got Away is a solid album for the most part, though not one that will likely one that will revitalize her previous commercial success or buy her new legions of fans.  \\"Let Us Move On\\" smartly brings in burgeoning rap darling Kendrick Lamar, but the chances of large exposure of the track seems unlikely.<br /><br />\\"No Freedom\\" seems concerned with the ambience, with Dido's vocals laden with reverb.  She sounds incredibly relaxed, which complements the folk-pop quality within the cut.  \\"No Freedom\\" is by no means an intense cut in itself, but the vocal arrangement and addition of instruments on the chorus add more body and intensity to the cut itself. \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" follows consistently, opening with cool, pulsating synths.  Dido's vocals are smooth (particularly her upper register), lacking the echoing reverb of the opener.  Simply on the chorus, Dido sings \\"If only for today / I wanna be / the girl who got away / the lover who really loved / the dancer who danced / to the last song...\\" The main rub with the title cut? Perhaps Dido comes off too relaxed and slightly lacking in personality.<br /><br />\\"Let Us Move On\\" finds Dido continuing in her casual, mysterious vocal approach, complemented by production to match the sentiment (Jeff Bhasker is onboard here).  Like the previous two cuts, this one is pleasant and Dido keeps things simple, particularly vocally on the chorus (\\"Let us move on...for this is short / and it will pass\\").  Kendrick Lamar drops a verse that matches the sentiment of both Dido and the cut itself.  It isn't the year's greatest triumph per say - it feels like it is missing something - but it is an enjoyable cut if not necessarily exceptional.<br /><br />On \\"Blackbird\\", Dido continues to indulge into her refined vocals, if perhaps a bit much.  Listeners do get a clever lyric, intact with a staccato vocal execution: \\"He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up / he added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that...\\"  The production has some nice cues, though remains subdued. Songwriter/producer Greg Kurstin assists on \\"End of The Night\\", which takes a cool electro-pop approach, intact with driving synth and programming.  Dido's best moment is during the bridge in which she exploits her upper register (\\"After the fall comes loves / I hat to hate and love to love\\"). The results? Pretty good.<br /><br />\\"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\\" is one of Girl Who Got Away's strongest showings. Dido sounds beautiful, commanding, and never over-sings and the production matches her reservedness.  Backing vocals accentuate the lead during the second and successive iterations of the chorus.  The chorus itself is simple, but there is a beautiful innocence in its penning: \\"There I was / sitting on the roof of the world  / there I was, there I was / Not knowing how I go there or how to leave...\\" \\"Love To Blame\\" contrasts the simplicity of \\"Sitting On The Roof\\" with an interesting groove with a reggae undertone coupled with a pop/electro beat.  Dido's upper register continues to shine, particularly given her breathy vocal approach. Lyrically, she hits a high mark with lyrics \\"She said I've dotted my I's and I've crossed my T's / had time for friends when they needed me...\\"<br />\\"Go Dreaming\\" makes one nod their head, given the percussive, driving beat with Europop flavor.  On \\"Happy New Year\\", Dido agains floats too casually, a detraction throughout Girl Who Got Away.  \\"Loveless Hearts\\" is more commanding than the latter, with Dido's vocals always commanding without necessarily being 'fiery' or forced.  Closing cut \\"Day Before We Went To War\\" is appropriately placed, but isn't quite as enjoyable as the beginning trio or the easygoing juggernaut \\"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\\".<br /><br />Does Dido miss the mark? Nope, she sounds solid and for the most part [[ASIN:B00BWGL6BS Girl Who Got Away]] has more solid moments than ill advised ones. The main problem for Dido is that sometimes the productions are too cool and the vibe too restrained and unflustered. Usually, being 'flustered' might be a detraction, but a shakeup wouldn't kill Dido.  Not known as a vocalist for histrionics (nor is that expected of her), Girl Who Got Away could have been even better and made a bigger splash with some more risks.  But examining this set for what it is, it is solid.asygoing juggernaut \\"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\\".<br /><br />Does Dido miss the mark?

B005OK81HA|4.0|We went to Scorpions concert The last sting so after that I wanted to get a CD. I thought CD would be the same as concert. Most of the songs they sing during concert are on this CD but also some remakes I'm not too crazy about, but overall I'm happy with purchase.

B002C39TTG|1.0|This review is specifically about the vinyl re-release (which is probably what Amazon is currently shipping). I'm a big fan of the album but was disappointed to find that the first copy I received was skipping constantly (about every 10 seconds there was some sort of blip). I asked for a replacement thinking I just got unlucky after trying other vinyls I had on hand and had no issues playing those. Unfortunately, the replacement also had the same skipping issues so I feel this re-release just was made poorly. Love the album though, but vinyl buyers beware!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This show is not like Tolkein, I was so glad to find out! It just is smart and draws you in! It is so well-done! My 21 year old son loves it, too. He stopped by my house, just to pick up season 2, which I ordered before I finished season 1, it was that good! My boyfriend loves it! I recommend it to everyone! I do think that there is way too much ridiculously stupid, gratuitous nudity! You'll see! I mean, RIDICULOUS, like some weird nude sex scene in a brothel while two men are carrying on a conversation.  It was just really stupid and ridiculous. If I wanted porn, I'd get porn, and I don't want porn and I told my 21 year old son not to use it as porn, and I hope he doesn't! Because it is a great story and so well-acted. Seriously, HBO, now, that u are known for such quality shows, do u have to be SLEAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????????????? I would prefer if you kept ur great series and your pornography separate, and I'm sure that I'm not the only person who feels like that.
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|What is going on here? I've had no problem with Amazon prime or instant video in the past. Perhaps this is why this seems more frustrating.<br />I don't understand why the show I rightfully purchased will not play! I purchased the entire first season and had to jostle between episodes to get it to play in order. I figured it was just a bug. When it came to the 5th episode, it stopped working altogether. My video library disappeared and GOTseason 1 is not even searchable on Amazon anymore.<br />The video library access online is cumbersome, at best.<br />I hope Amazon could do something to resolve this issue. Pricing and access were the only reasons I had chosen this service. If I'm stripped from either, I have no reason to continue with Amazon prime.

B001BSH11G|5.0|I was wary of purchasing a new release of this album having been disappointed with other reproduction albums purchased recently, however this is a high quality product. The outer and inner sleeves are very nicely made using quality card stock and the vinyl is very thick and stable. Overall it is a high quality reproduction of the original release and I would recommend it to anyone considering this product.

B003YOASY2|5.0|Seriously. The best album of this style ever made. There is no comparison. The interludes are worth the cost alone. And the song about Dio.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|this is not the first film adaptation of this novel but i believe it is the best.  what was done was to rev up the romance so that it could finally hold its own with PRIDE & PREJUDICE. The first thing it did right was to finally get a leading man who would make our hearts beat faster.  oh, yes rupert penry-jones certainly did that. i've seen him on other UK shows like the criminal WHITECHAPEL and the spy based MI5. but it is this film which gives him romantic gravitas.  if you were a fan of Colin Firth as Darcy, you are about to become a fan of Penry-Jones as Wentworth. i think every single jane austen novel has needed a romantically persuasive leading man for its film adaptation to work.  this is not to say that the female is unimportant as this adaptation also has the best actress doing the role.  but my belief is that the critical casting job has to be the leading man.  if he doesn't set our hearts aflutter, forget the whole project.<br /><br />Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root did an earlier version. Hinds as Wentworth did not set my heart aflutter at all.  I liked him much better playing a bill clinton like ex president with sigourney weaver in the Hillary like role on american tv.  root was just too plain and mousey as the heroine.  sally hawkins here as anne elliott is a lot more convincing as a woman wentworth might pursue.<br /><br />next, austen excels at these comedic minor roles. these are expertly done in this adaptation.  there is the heroine's father, who is a complete snob who has done nothing with his life other than to inherit a title.  his self regard is hilarious.next most comic is the hero's naval friend who reads doomed romantic poetry constantly due to his intended's recent death. his long, mournful walks out on the rocks over the spewing sea, apparently all but ready to throw himself into the drink, ultimately become comic as well. there is also the heroine's sister who at least is a hypochondriac or maybe a forerunner of munchauser's syndrome.<br /><br />this adaptation takes some artistic license with things like the heroine running through the street and such. i do not mind these rather minor flourishes being added in the movie version.  true, they could not have really happened during the Regency but I personally do not watch Jane Austen film adaptations as historical documentaries.<br /><br />if you miss this version of PERSUASION, really, it is too bad of you if you are an Austen fan.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B008220D5K|5.0|I'm not one for the stupid funny type movies and this is not one of them. This movie is a hilarious movie with a story behind it. It also is not a slapstick comedy and is very funny from the very beginning all the way into the credits with some serious subjects behind it. Definitely one of my favorite movies now. Yes there are a lot of characters in the story but who of us have a handful of people in our lives? Most of us have a lot of people in our lives and that's why this is like that and all the characters play a certain role. It portrays real life situations, people, and basic every day life we can relate to. Bottom line is this is a great movie. As long as you are a human being with some sort of sense of humor  you will enjoy this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the game is really fun and has good graphics. Some charecters are very time consuming to get also the same with the boards. All in all this is a good game and can be quite fun.

B006YC74E8|5.0|This app is my very first photography editor app I installed and was searching for something better. As I have installed and uninstalled over 15 photography editor applications I find this one app the best at everything and the updates that have been installed into this one application have become even better than before. Most of all the easy use of this application and the crazy addiction I have with this will make you go crazy with possibility of color, light, undertones, and overlays.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Second attempt at watching this movie thinking I might have missed something on the first try. So filled with dialogue and blah, blah, blah that I couldn't keep up with it. It was also plodding and affected. Historically superficial at best. Not about Lincoln, but about the 13th amendment. I stopped watching it at about 25 minutes into it. This was approximately the same point at which I stopped watching it the first time. Waste of time. I've lost money on these two attempts. No need to watch in my view.
B00AR1G3FS|3.0|Firstly, I have had this concert on regular DVD for years and it's absolutely fantastic.  The best video concert I own.    I just ordered the Blu-Ray remaster in hopes that the video and audio would be better quality than the DVD, and unfortunately it's not.  I'm guessing that in 2004 they didn't have HD video cameras and HD audio recording equipment, but whatever the cause I guess I'm a bit disappointed that I bought an identical copy of what I already own.    Edit:    Just to rebut some of the comments to my review:  I have a very nice, high end up-sampling DVD and high end sound system (DAC, Pass Labs Pre/Amp, etc).  I still feel the audio quality is only *very* marginally better in this blu-ray than it was in the standard 2-disc DVD.  Audio is almost identical.    I'm an HD snob.  I can't watch any televised event (sport especially, but really anything) in regular def, and to me this blu-ray is \\"better end of DVD quality\\" and nothing more.  This could *not* have been shot with an HD camera, so how could it deliver true HD quality?  Just MHO.  What I *do* like is the fact that it's all on one disc.  It's a small convenience, but one that matters in the middle of a night.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book.  If you follow the 4 agreements your life changes and your outlook is brighter.  I have found the most important agreement to be &#34;be true to your word&#34;.  Honesty is an important commodity and if you are always true to your word you please your inner self and those around you.  I didn't find it to be a self help book exactly but rather a book for defining your life
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|It's OK but not something that I would play again & again.  Good images and animation but not an intriguing storyline.
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|Nostalgic.  Probably my favorite movie when I was a child so adore it still today.  Love the freedom it gives to kids to dream and fantacize amazing adventures.  In my opinion, Walt Disney's absolute greatest &#34;old school&#34; film.
