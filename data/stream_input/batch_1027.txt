014241543X|4.0|If I Stay by Gayle Forman was completely... amazing. I would not recommend it to extremely sensetive and emotional people, though. You will flip out. It's very intense. It reaches out to you on such a deep level...<br /><br />Mia is a teenage girl, but I will admit: for me, it wasn't very easy to relate to her. She plays cello, oddly. Has a best friend, Kim, and a rockin boyfriend, Adam, although she often feels out of place around him and his bandmates. Parents, and an annoying little brother... But from the first suspensful sentence, you know her life is about to change forever. There is a car accident, and within seconds, Mia is stuck between life and death.<br /><br />I loved how Forman wrote it. Each chapter starts with the time of day and procedes in intelligent detail, telling you about Mia and how things in the hospital are going. Then there is a break, and the story takes you out of the grim hospital setting and flashs back to Mia's life before. So the whole book is not her contemplating death (which is good). And they crash on page 15 and by page 19, Mia is wondering if she is dead. It's NOT one of those books that has no action until at least halfway through.<br /><br />This is one of those books you can't put down. Like, you want to stop reading, but you can't because it's as if the story will go on without you as soon as you stop. You just have to keep reading, staying at Mia's side through her entire journey.<br /><br />Warning: when I say grim hospital setting, I mean Mia actually describes the gory details of the wreck, the injuries and the ICU. It's a super emotional book if you've ever been there... in a similar situation, or knew someone who did.<br />Also, I wouldn't say it's really a love story, and I wouldn't compare it to Twilight in any way. But its sooo worth the read. &lt;3

B002ZG9846|5.0|First, let me say this movie isn't for the weak hearted.  If you don't like violence, this movie isn't for you.  I never read the comics or knew anything about it, so when I first watched the movie I was a bit surprised by the violence and blood in it.  However, this movie is great from start to finish.  Tons of actions mixed in with some laugh out loud moments makes this one of the best movies of 2010.    As many other reviewers discussed, Hit Girl is the obvious star of the movie as she steals every scene she is in.  Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl) gives one of the best \\"child\\" performances you will ever see.  All other actors/actresses hold their own in this movie, especially Nic Cage.  I'm not a Nic Cage hater, but I never thought I would say he was absolutely brilliant in any movie.  He plays the role of Big Daddy perfectly and shows emotions that you usually don't see from him in other movies.    Possible spoiler...    One scene that I have to talk about is the \\"unmasking\\" scene with Kick Ass.  The direction, action and emotion of this scene is unreal.  The Director nailed this moment in the movie with impressive visual camera work and non-stop action.  Really impressive, and is something that you have to see.    Definitely recommend this and you don't have to be a comic book fan to enjoy it.

B001GCUNWQ|2.0|It used to be that cartoons were never turned into sequels.  But it seems Hollywood is running out of ideas, so we have the third Ice Age movie in about a decade.  This time we have dinosaurs as both protagonists and antagonists, along with a mate for Scrat.  All the other main characters are back from the first two movies, with the same actors and actresses providing the voices.  Like the first two movies, this one is a combination of comedy and family drama.  The soundtrack is lackluster, the comedy is primarily one-liners and some screwball comedy, and the action is OK.  Overall, a slightly boring movie that might keep your kids occupied for a while.

B000JML7EC|4.0|I'm so delighted that so many of the literary classics which I've enjoyed in my childhood and youth are now available as freebies which I can download to my Kindle and read at my leisure. \\"Treasure Island\\" impressed me as a youngster with its high sense of adventure and it still does. Yes, the language used takes some getting used to, and it is certainly quite different from what most youngsters are reading these days in terms of the language style and form, but the themes in this literary classic are still relevant today and those who are not put off by the style will appreciate this work. It's disheartening to see many of these literary classics ignored in favor of generic stories which seem to captivate younger readers these days, but I hope making these works available as free downloads will entice more readers to give these classics a chance.
030726999X|4.0|If you did read the first and second book of the trilogy, there is no way around it, you will read this third book. I like the writing atmosphere of Stieg Larsson, you can feel yourself in Sweden, even I myself have never been in that country. The pages turn fast, I did finish it in two evenings. The ending chapters are a bit weak because the suspense is gone, so in total, this book is not as strong as the first two. The first two books keep you on the edge and in suspense all the way cover to cover. And I did feel sad that Stieg Larsson is dead. I wished the story would continue in a next book.
1931788340|5.0|This book is an excellent oportunity for those who want to know Shore´s work in detail. Great photographs, excellent quality and very good essays. The only negative point is that it´s not include a great photograph taken just at the corner in Washington Avenue and 8 th street [included in other old versions of \\"uncommon places\\"], anyway as a conclusion: A must have book !

B00001QEFU|5.0|Twisted Sister, after nine years of scratching and clawing their way to stardom, finally achieved a record deal in the UK of all places where the band had temporarily relocated after slugging through most of their career in obscurity outside of the greater New York area. `Under the Blade' is an underrated metal masterpiece (yes I said masterpiece and Twisted Sister in the same review) which not only took almost a decade to create (many of the songs had been in the band's club sets for many moons) but also it was their best and most consistently hard hitting record (including the band's multi-platinum breakthrough `Stay Hungry').  Secret Records, a short-lived indie label and UFO legend Pete Way put the Sisters' dreams to vinyl in the late summer of 1982 after a preview EP (`Ruff Cuts') had given the Dee Snider and has glam mongrels some new life earlier in the year. The band had been started by guitarist Jay Jay French in 1973 as a New York Dolls clone glam band. When Dee Snider joined mid-decade, Twisted Sister's music became more metallic as Snider brought his heavy Sabbath and Priest influences which the group combined with their Dolls/Alice Cooper musings. It took the NWOBHM to break the band naturally and the band's breakthrough recordings reflected their origins. `Under the Blade' provided any devotee of classic metal with heaping portions of said entrée. \\"What You Don't Know\\" (opener), \\"Shoot `Em Down\\" and the title track which had all previously been on the EP are as good as it gets and would stand up to much of this era's best loved head bangers. \\"Run for Your Life\\", \\"Bad Boys\\" and the super heavy \\"Destroyer\\" continued the onslaught. When the LP was remixed and reissued after the band's mega stardom in 1985; early indie single \\"I Never Grow Up Now!\\" made the cut which show's some of Twisted Sister's early glam/punk influence. Again, for metal fans who think Dee Snider is a joke and are put off by the `Bette Midler on acid' look, then you should check out the band's early albums and there is no better place to start then to accept the Blade!
B001I82RVS|5.0|Only one word can describe this movie. GOREFULL! Its one of the most blood thirsty movies ive ever seen since Dead Alive (aka) Brain Dead. What an amazing movie. its incredible how cheezy the acting is and how many barrels of blood they actually used in the making of this film.    Asian Horror Movies are now my favorite insane movies. I wanna get more of these movies. I wanna get \\"Onechanbara\\" or \\"Meatball Machine\\". But ive seen Audition and Old Boy and i dont think i could find a more insane movie than those. Any suggestions?
B003G88WTO|3.0|The first time I heard from Caribou, it was 2007. Andorra had just hit stores and I was impressed with their unique take on electronic music that played a bit with vocals similar to Animal Collective. Mostly though, it stood entirely by itself. With Swim, I can definitely hear where their inspirations are coming from even more than before. The first couple tracks sounded so remarkably like Royksopp that it completely took me back. I'm not saying they ripped them off in any way, but it sounds like something they(Royksopp) could have easily written or easily could write on any given day. The rest of the songs were vintage Caribou with some of the experimental elements from before and a few new ideas just to keep it interesting... though it felt like there was too much going on at a couple of different points. The problem with this record is the same problem I had with Andorra: This isn't something I want to listen to very much. Once you've heard it, there really isn't much to keep you coming back. There were definitely a couple stand-outs, but again it wasn't sustained throughout. So not so original anymore, but if you were already blindly in love with Caribou and love Royksopp, no downside, right?
B003P2VCOS|4.0|This novel had all the promise of a thrilling and enthralling cyber-novel that would leave people wanting more. It started magnificently - as a computer person I could see where he was taking the story and it was potentially fantastic. About halfway through however, it got a little silly. It changed from fantastic to fantasy. The ending was really nothing more than a \\"please make into a movie\\" request. Huge promise but the end product fell a little short. Still four stars though because Suarez has what it takes and it was still entertaining, even if not completely fulfilling.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I like the Rumble.  I like the Sixaxis.  I like the wireless functionality.  I like the recharging cable that comes with the controller.  However, I HATE the redesigned L2/R2 buttons.  What was Sony thinking?  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!    The slippage-prone L2 and R2 buttons just feel \\"wrong\\" in my hands.  They feel mushy and imprecise.  Clipping on the Dual Trigger thingys ([[ASIN:B001IAOEXU PS3 Dual Triggers]]) helps somewhat, but nothing can replace the feeling of the L2/R2 buttons on the PS2 controller.  This is a good example of change just for change's sake.  I bet some exec at Sony decided to leave his mark on the company's history by forcing an arbitrary change to what was already a perfect product -- well, he just ended up ruining it!

B000MWZTSO|5.0|I find reading the Harry Potter books in french has been a great way to saturate myself with french words. I started out having to look almost every word on the page up and now I can read almost an entire chapter without picking up my dictionary or english copy. What a great idea, I wish I would have thought of it sooner. Of course I love the Harry Potter stories and can read them over and over again. I also have the french version of the little prince and have thought of getting some of my other favorite books as well. I have to say I ordered the french version of the first harry potter dvd and I still have a hard time keeping up, but now that I have watched it about three times I am getting the hand of understanding most of what they say, but it still seems like they talk too fast! Good luck!
B000002KOQ|5.0|I bought this to replace a cassette I had for many years. I can't believe it took me so long to do, since it's been one of my favorite Joni or anybody albums for about 20 years. This is from 1974, and along with an earlier album \\"Blue\\"  and 1975's \\"Court and Spark\\" this is the middle album of a great trifecta when Joni was at the top of her game. Yes, it has that early '70's introspective, maybe too serious singer-songwriter vibe, but when you're this talented, why not? Each song sets a physical and emotional mood. I'm not surprised that Joni is also a serious painter--you can see a very clear image of every song as if you're looking at a painting of it. For instance, my mind's eye can \\"see\\" the details (of my own creation) of the room with the \\"small white bed\\" in the song, \\"Rainy Night House,\\" and \\"hippie chicks\\" busying themselves in the title song. \\"For Free\\" stands out as a tribute to street musicians. Some of the songs are over serious, more serious than I remember such as \\"The Arrangement\\" and \\"The Priest\\" but that may just be me getting older, and taking things less seriously than I did when I first got into this album. Still a great album; classic songs--intricate arrangements, yet simply melodies, how did she do that?
0307269760|5.0|I borrowed this from the library, and because I'm a slow reader, found myself having read only about half the book the day before it was due.  So I sat down and read the rest of the stories in one day.  And now that it's finished and I returned it to the library, I feel like I want to go back into the world that Munro creates, even though the world in each story is quite different.  To me, that's that mark of a great author -- someone who creates a world so full, so believable, so compelling, that you just don't want to leave. Take this description of one disagreeable character: \\"Certain suggestions, or notions, would make the muscles of her lean spotty face quiver, her eyes go sharp and black, and her mouth work as if there was a despicable taste in it. She could stop you in your tracks then, like a savage thornbush.\\" That particular description stopped me in my tracks, with the one thought: brilliant!

The USB cable fits in the outer zipper pocket, which has a side gusset so you can store chubby items like AA batteries or a battery pack.  As for the padding, I wouldn't hand it to a gorilla like on the old suitcase commercials, but it's sufficient to protect the HD from purse/backpack jostling.  Great, cheaper alternative to made-for-HD cases.

1439152756|5.0|Read this with my book club. We agreed that we actually would feel cognitively impaired while reading this.   That is, I think, a high compliment to the author who has managed to create such an intense connection between the reader and the book's main character.

0061714372|5.0|The one prevailing thought I came away from... after reading this entire book over 2-3 days... is that I am GLAD that Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica.  There is no way he would ever have let himself be dictated to ... and no way he would have ever subjected himself to downplaying his creative abilities to the wants and needs of Hetfield and Ulrich.  The thing is... METALLICA= Hetfield & Ulrich the same as KISS= Stanley & Simmons.  Good or bad, that's the way it is.  The creative direction of those two bands has always been dictated by the authoritarian musicians listed.  After all, it is their bands... they are the leaders.  Mustaine is also a leader... so you can imagine what it was probably like to have so many chefs in the Metallica kitchen.  It would have been an Iron Chef Bloodbath!!!!<br /><br />Mustaine instead took this anger and frustration and put together one of the finest thrash/metal bands in the pantheon of that genre.  As evidenced on the music...  he has written great songs that sound fresh and that kick your ass year after year.  Based on this book, I don't think he realizes quite what he has accomplished.  If he did, he wouldn't always be living under the shadow of Metallica.<br /><br />I felt the chapter that discussed Metallica's entry into the R&R Hall of Fame was pretty damn good.  Mustaine takes the high road.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a great memoir of the origins of Metallica, and the history of Megadeth in broad swatches.  It doesn't go into any detail on recording, or songwriting... which I wish it had.  I wanted to read about how Mustaine actually learned his six stringed skills in some detail... all he does is mention some of his influences from time to time.  If you're looking for this type of stuff... (the nuts & bolts of the creation of Megadeth's music)... this book is not for you.  Instead, it goes for the emotional stuff... the drugs/rehab/love stories... the stuff that you might see in a movie adaptation.  But that stuff does make for some great reading, I have to say.<br /><br />Maybe Mustaine has said all he wants to say about the details in his various GUITAR WORLD interviews... it would have been nice to see that stuff here.  It would also have been nice to see a complete discography at the end (with the musicians listed).  After all, didn't he realize that some readers might be new to the music of Megadeth?  Yeah I know I can pull up that stuff in the Wikipedia... but it would have been a convenient addition.<br /><br />Must I write it... this book is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.f does make for some great reading, I have to say.<br /><br />Maybe Mustaine has said all he wants to say about the details in his various GUITAR WORLD interviews... it would have been nice to see that stuff here.

0374532125|1.0|As someone with both international financial experience and who's currently running an education ngo on the ground in Africa, I was very disappointed with this book.  Most of us acknowledge the following:    1.  Growth is needed  2.  Aid isn't a path to growth  3.  In some instances, aid may even retard growth    However, what aid is is a stop-gap measure, a bandaid if you will, designed to buy time and to mitigage death and suffering until development efforts pull people the masses out of poverty.  In time, less and less aid will be needed (at least theoretically).    While aid in and of itself is not the solution, it's naive and downright cruel to suggest we cut (or scrap) it, for the sake of economic efficiency.  Aid keeps millions of people alive and reduces countless suffering.    For example, distributing ARVs won't halt the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  Prevention (and God-willing a vaccine) will.  Are we to cut all ARV funding and subject 30+ million people to death?  B/c it's certainly not economically efficient (or productive) in terms of eradicating the pandemic.  Of course not.    Both aid and development efforts (most importantly those focused on education and health) are needed.
1577312082|5.0|This is not JUST a self-improvement or New-age book, it is MUCH more than that!<br /><br />To me this is EXACTLY a restatement for our time of the essence of ALL spiritual teachings (to paraphrase Tolle).  How much bigger than that can we get?  This EXPLAINS what Jesus (and Buddha, amongst others) meant and how we can not only believe, but KNOW the truth of God.  To have an explanation of what some of the strange biblical (and other religious books) statements & parables mean is an eye-opener of note:<br /><br />The parable of the servant waiting for his master's return;<br />The story of the prodigal son;<br />Jesus's statements \\"before Abraham was, I am\\", \\"Look under a rock, I am there\\";<br />\\"No man who puts his hands to the plough & looks back, is fit for the Kingdom of God\\"<br />The Book of Mary and Jesus's instruction:  \\"Seek the child of True Humanity within (yourselves)\\".  \\"Those who seek WILL find it\\".<br />\\"Be Still and know that I am God\\".<br /><br />The bible's statements are meant to be lived (another Tolle quote), not merely believed in mentally!  This book explains how.  The fact that Tolle explains all this in a religious-sect-INDEPENDENT way will help anyone REGARDLESS of religious affiliation.<br /><br />While listening to the audiobook you CAN literally FEEL the energy response to Tolle's words inside you.  I coupled this with the Wayne W. Dyer book [[ASIN:140190131X Getting in the Gap: Making Conscious Contact with God Through Meditation (Book with CD)]] to get the meditation part right.  Chanting doesn't suit me, personally, but the results work - & are incredible!<br /><br />Get this book.  Try meditation.  Experience the results physically.  Find out WHAT you really are.  Find the truth.<br /><br />Nothing short of \\"Awesome\\"!  :)

0385737947|4.0|Thomas is an awesome character and I could feel how much he cared about Theresa. Theresa was also an amazing girl and I liked that she was really strong and intelligent at times. The other characters seemed to blend together at times. It took me a while to get into this book. The Maze Runner has an amazing premise, but I felt that a lot of this book was could have been condensed or cut out. I did like the mystery in WICKED and the secret codes. I also liked the though of an unsolvable maze. I found it to be a pretty original for a Dystopian novel, but I feel that is could have been stronger. Dashner is a great writer and I am excited to see what he writes next. I would recommend this book to fans of Uglies and The Hunger Games.
B003X73QA8|5.0|One thing I have always liked about this band the Arcade Fire is how they don't take themselves too seriously.  Especially on this album, when they are singing about a topic as all-important as growing up in the suburbs, they make sure that it's all a bit tongue-in-cheek.  They don't try to beat into your head with every beat that this is the most meaningful and moving song anyone has ever written since The River.  The lead singer also makes sure to incorporate lots of jokes into his lyrics if you pay close attention.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|When I heard they were doing a remake of the Clash of the Titans I was really looking forward to seeing it and I came home thinking what a waste of money.   Basically Perceus hating everything about the gods of Olympus and wanting revenge after his adopted parents are killed when they ship sinks in a storm created by the god Hades.  Perceus then decides to set off and get revenge for his parents death by defeating the Hades.    The movie from the 80s was basically a love story and good against evil this version is one man looking for revenge because he parents are killed by a god.  Great CGI, plot, bad acting     Other than the names of the characters, the killing of Medusa and the name this movie is as unlike the original as you can get and the only reason it gets 1 star is for the CGI which is the only thing this movie was worth watching for.    If your looking for a good movie whose graphics you would laugh at today then go for the original but if your looking for something thats visually impressive but not much more then this is the one you want.

0307454541|3.0|spoiler alert--this review gives away the story to some degree: I liked the book. However, it turned out to be over the top. I prefer sublties and nuance, this book started out this way then went nuts. It was almost as if the writer grew bored of his own story, so decided to finish the last third of the book with the most dramatic, horrifying ideas he could come up with: the combination of serial killing, incest, rape, and the intrigues of big business. I actually didn't really feel like finishing the book at that point because the writing turned cliche and the story grew too far out of proportion. If you like highly sensationalized stories with plenty of sex, death, and intrigue, you will like this book; otherwise, skip the book and wait for the movie.
B000N4SHOE|3.0|The story opens in 1901 in London, as Beatrix Potter (Ren&eacute;e  Zellweger) has just had her first book, [[ASIN:0723257930 The Tale of Peter Rabbit]], accepted for publication.  She and her publisher (Ewan McGregor) begin to fall in love, but since he is well below Beatrix's social station, her parents are outraged.  The plucky young writer agrees to wait a bit but is determined the wedding will take place.<br /><br />The movie has three things I liked very much: Miss Potter's iconic watercolors are lovingly shown and even gently animated, the turn of the century period is reproduced in fine detail, and the Lake District where she lived in later life is beautifully photographed.  Unfortunately, I thought Zellweger was badly miscast as Beatrix with her too-too precious 'Bridget Jones' accent and mannerisms and her constant, manic, smirking grin; I just found her annoying.  McGregor was bland and lacked any romantic appeal and the second love of her life is only alluded to, leaving a story that felt half-told.<br /><br />The Potter biography in the DVD Extras was much better than the actual movie, in my opinion.  Her books have been loved worldwide for nearly a century and deserved to have their story told in a film; this just wasn't a good enough version.

Before this I had only listened to The Beatles and a few other bands. The Wall showed me there was other incredible music out there. This album got me into Pink Floyd, 70's Rock, Roger Waters, and more music in general. This album is so emotionally powerful and musically incredible, I think it surpasses any other album ever made. I would recommend this album to absolutely anyone.

Not only do the daily activities make me disappointed, the maltreatments of the people round but also the queer, reasonless things that confuse me so much. There are no less times I commit mistakes which torment me until now, also isn't few of times I cause grievances towards others, those all things happen consecutively, prolong till this day. I lived in anger, torment, fear, no escape and so many times I asked myself for what reason I live, not few times I thought about death, finding a way to suicide. I was sure I would leaf this world, but at those decisive times I gained the flash of Truths, they give me the meaning of living.   I read some famous saying like that: There's always an escape, Do save your save yourself first and God will save youu, Let you wait and time will give you the answer. Those saying were the consolations and hope during my whole life.

B003SJ4VJ6|4.0|Even knowing how this story ends, I felt tense and jumpy. No easy feat when the film is a thriller based on a popular novel, especially when the movie is essentially faithful to the book.<br /><br />What most impresses me here is the sense of feeling WATCHED, right along with the protagonist. In one memorable instance, a conversation on the beach is filmed from a point of view that places the silent bodyguard at the center of the frame as he follows his charges, so that even though he's in the background and does nothing to call attention to himself, this minor character becomes central to the scene. For these few moments, it's impossible not to watch the watcher; his anonymous presence becomes as ominous as whatever unseen dangers it averts.<br /><br />Well done. Chilling.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|This album is definitely full of energy (even the \\"slow ballad\\" We Are Broken has energy to it) and it's easy to see why the band decided to name it Riot.  The entire album is basically a huge riot against love, high school drama, and corporations.  It's definitely a bit of a different feel from All We Know Is Falling, especially in terms of the energy in the music, and I absolutely recommend buying this album.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I've had this disc for 5 years and a friend just got me back into Dream Theater.  After one play a month ago, I am breathless with all the music involved with this album.  I will keep this short and to the point.  This album is brilliant.  Exciting and yet brings me to tears.  \\"Who would wish this on a people.\\"  A cry out for the 9/11 tragedy.  End.
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|This is definitely a good first effort on Paramore's part, especially considering that they had a big line-up change within the band during and right after the album was recorded.  It definitely showcases well what they are all about and it's easy to see why they have evolved into the band they are today.  I definitely recommend this album to all Paramore lovers out there.
B0036TGSRG|5.0|After watching this film, I immediately bought the novel. Loved them both. However, I am having a problem with the disc. Have changed it three times at Best Buy and each copy begins by telling me it was previously viewed and gives me choice to start the film at the beginning or from where it was last stopped. When I try to watch film, it freezes right before Ewan Mcgregor meets  Eli Wallach. All three discs have done the same thing. Is anyone else having this problem? I usually buy all my discs from Amazon but lately I have been finding them a lot cheaper at places like Wal Mart, Target etc. If anyone has purchased this film from Amazon and has had no problems with it, I would love to hear from you. Three trips to Best Buy( a different branch each time) has worn me out!

B000VNMMR0|3.0|The first three Die Hard films were thrilling,. This one isn't really in the same league, but it's not as awful as it seems. First off, I will say that it's really nice to see Bruce Willis return as John McClane. He's still awesome here as he was in the first three. Plus, the action is still exciting the fourth time around: lots of explosions and gunfights and car chases. Unfortunately, this film probably the most flawed in the entire series. One of the problems is the presence of Justin Long. Now, I don't have anything against this guy, but he doesn't seem to fit in the movie. He's more of a distraction rather than an ordinary supporting character. Secondly, the climax is very weak: compared to the climaxes in the first three Die Hard films, this one fails miserably. And finally, Kevin Smith's cameo was more aggravating than amusing. Even the joke about Boba Fett didn't hit the right notes. Basically, Live Free or Die Hard isn't as good as the first three, but it still has enough action and humor to hold your interest. It's still very fun.<br /><br />Grade: C+<br /><br />P.S., let's not forget about the first three Die Hard films.<br />Die Hard: [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard]]<br /><br />Die Hard 2: [[ASIN:B000O77SRM Die Hard 2 - Die Harder]]<br /><br />Die Hard with a Vengeance: [[ASIN:B000O78KW4 Die Hard with a Vengeance]]

B002VECM6S|3.0|\\"The Blind Side\\" (2009)  --------------------------------------  Sandra Bullock won an Academy Award for best actress for this role?  Seriously??     I mean, look, I like Sandra Bullock, got nothing against her, but \\"best actress\\" over Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep (in her delicious turn as Julia Child in \\"Julie & Julia\\")?  Not to mention newcomer Gabourey Sidibe, in \\"Precious\\" - now *that* was a remarkable performance!  I dunno, Bullock's performance here was adequate, mildly charming, but really contained very little fire to it, and hardly any surprises.  Plus, the movie was so predictable and vanilla... and so terribly, terribly condescending towards its subjects and its audience. Like \\"Crash\\" a few years earlier, the Oscar popularity of this tepid, cliche-filled after-school special is more indicative of the shallow, dysfunctional state of race relations in America than it is of any great depth or craftsmanship in the film itself. It's a mildly entertaining but second-rate movie which triumphed in part due to a relatively weak field of competing nominees. But... yawn, really.    Anyway, congrats to Ms. Bullock, even though Meryl was robbed. (Axton Von Crankypants)
B003956Z8O|5.0|This is my favorite album ever recorded.<br />That being said, I have only listened to it about 10 times because I never ever want to get tired or bored of it. I only bust it out during very special occasions. \\"Congratulations\\" makes me vomit, the way I imagine heroin would. Except I have never tried heroin. At least, not on purpose.<br /><br />This one time I was in NYC with this beautiful redhead named Cheri and she asked if I wanted to \\"go downtown.\\"<br />I did not know that was slang for \\"do heroin.\\"<br />So of course I said yes 'cause I thought that just meant \\"drive into Manhattan.\\"<br /><br />Next thing I know there's a bunch of beautiful pristine white powder on a mirror. Like a perfect day for snowboarding if I were on a mountain.<br />So I snort it all thinking it's cocaine.<br />But no, it's China White. And that is when I overdosed and could hear everyone's thoughts in the room clear as a bell as I vomited out the window and was rushed around in a silver Durango. This is why I rarely listen to my favorite album ever recorded, \\"Congratulations.\\"
030745455X|5.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire is a great read, the kind that you don't find very often.  The twists and turns of the plot keep you reading, not wanting to put it down. The tension in trying to find out if Lizabeth Salander is a good guy or a bad guy keeps you reading on. If there is any down side it would be the number of characters to keep up with and the Swedish names, but it's well worth the effort.  This is the second of the series starting with The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.  I can hardly wait to read the third in the series.
0439023521|5.0|All three high schools in my district are doing a \\"one district, on book\\" initiative, requiring every man, woman and child to read this book over the summer. This includes all 9-12 graders and every teacher, faculty, or staff member. I happen to be a math teacher. The book has a \\"reality show\\" flavor to it, that should appeal to today's youth. I feel it is well written so far (I'm on page 80).     I'm trying not to over-analyze the plot or imagine what historical and political influences would prevent such a world from existing. It's SUPPOSED to be fiction, and I like my fiction to be fictional. Remember that it has to hold the attention of pubescent teens. And I believe that the book moves along at a fast enough pace to do just that. The main characters are in just this age group and much of the dialogue, I should hope, will be palatable to my students.    I would say that it has been quite enjoyable so far. And if a majority of the students in our district are READING... and reading a BOOK!!!... we've got a damn miracle on our hands. So I believe that this book was a great selection.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|Ever since BFMV came into the world of mainstream, they have become more and more popular among many metalcore and metal acts. Everyone love \\"The Poison\\" and how it could not have been a better debut with catchy choruses that stuck in your head through the whole entire day while \\"Scream,Aim,Fire\\" was high powered and full of speed and amazing guitar work on Matt and Padge's part. Now that they have been around for several years though, and \\"Fever\\" has come out, people believe mainstream success has gotten into their head, but I disagree. In my opinion, they stayed true to their roots featuring songs with amazing guitar playing like in the song \\"Alone\\" and drums that just sound freakin' amazing as well as lyrics and vocals that hold emotion that go to a deeper level than a normal may believe.<br /><br />It has been said that BFMV did this album more for themselves than anything else, and in truth, I believe that as when you listen to some of the lyrics they become quite personal for Matt Tuck. Aside from that, people have complained about their not being as much screaming in this album as the other two or the same ferocity like the two previous ones. I will say yes to the first one, but no to the second. Yes, there is less screaming vocals on Jay and Matt's part, but does screaming really make the band? No it doesn't! The music style is what makes the band. The music! Not a type of vocals. It is just something that adds a different side of things or emotion. Now, the reason I say no to the second argument is that there are some heavy songs that show how awesome of a metalcore band they are. \\"Begging For Mercy\\", \\"Your Betrayal\\", and \\"Pretty on the Outside\\" are all songs that have amazing riffs, guitars, drums, the whole nine yards! Now the only reason why they may not have the same intensity as the other two is because they mean something more for the band than what so called \\"fans\\" can figure out.<br /><br />Now, here is my recommendation.  If you like BFMV because of their screaming and heavy metal sound, then don't get this album because you will complain about it and want your money back. If you like them for their musical talent and capabilities, showing different sides of the band, then definitely get this album. It is different, but a good kind of different. A lot of people are afraid to see different sides of a band, but in all honesty, you shouldn't be because it just means the band is experimenting with ideas that they like and want to see how they work out.This album is without a doubt a 5/5 for me, but hopefully this will help with your decision to buy it if your on the verge of doing so but are skeptical about it. Here is how I would grade the songs though:<br /><br />1. Your Betrayal 10/10- An amazing opener for the album and the song as Moose does an amazing job on the drums, and the whispers and a somewhat creepy quality to the lyrics that works out wonderfully for them.<br /><br />2. Fever 8/10- Even though the grade is an eight, the song is still catchy as the wordy just stick to your mind. No real complaints though. It just doesn't hit me as exciting as the first song, but it is still good.<br /><br />3. The Last Fight 10/10- Reminds me a lot of \\"Scream,Aim,Fire\\" as it is fast, intense and has an amazing guitar solo by Padge.<br /><br />4. A Place Where You Belong 10/10- I love the scream in the beginning of the song that starts it out, and from there, it just gets better and better.<br /><br />5. Pleasure and Pain 10/10- Jay does an awesome job with his screaming in the beginning again, and this one has the intensity in the beginning like \\"The Last Fight\\" does. The chorus is something that will stick in your head as well. It will bring you only pleasure, I think.<br /><br />6. Alone 11/10- Padge does the best job on his guitar with the opener of this song with notes flying that show you why they should be put on Guitar Hero more often! Anyway, the song is just a really emotional one as it has the heaviness ofan awesome metalcore song with just insane parts for everyone.<br /><br />7. Breaking Out, Breaking Down 10/10- Just another awesome song from them, and I think Matt's vocals have improved so much from when they first started...<br /><br />8. Bittersweet Memories 10/10- More catchy choruses and more great vocals from Matt with Padge doing great work on the guitar with Jay's occasional screaming that finishes the formula.<br /><br />9. Dignity 10/10- I love the speed this one has. It's another song that adds to the intensity of the song with kick ass solos from Padge once more.<br /><br />10. Begging For Mercy 12/10- Without a doubt the most heavy song on the album and probably the most b.a. one. I love Jay's screaming in it. He does an awesome job that would not dissatisfy anyone.<br /><br />11. Pretty on the Outside 11/10- My second favorite song on the album and a great closure. It continues the ferocity of \\"Begging For Mercy\\" with an amazing chorus that is really really catchy.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few people. If not, sorry for wasting your time.one.    7.

B002ZG974M|5.0|Other reviewers have given the synopsis of the movie so I won't repeat it here.  This film is a splendid work of art and simply delightful.  There are no words - the babies faces and movements say it all.  We are left to draw our own conclusions about the variety of parenting styles around the world and the cultural differences are clearly delineated here.  But all in all, the babies are the clear focus, full of originality, simplicity, and complexity --- and they speak volumes.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|Like so few movie heroes I've grown up with since I was a kid, Rocky will be missed the most.  This film was done in true Rocky form.  With cast members like Burt Young, Tony Burton, and archive footage of the loyal and ever-steadfast wife to Rocky, Talia Shire.  And of the lengendary and beloved Burgess Meredith, Mickey, and my heart warms as I think of Mickey as I think of my own grandfather who was just as hard on me.       Rocky was a household name.  And EVERYONE knew who Rocky Balboa and the Italian Stallion were.  The same person.  Legendary, unforgettable, and the utmost hero when you needed one.      Thank you, Sylvester Stallone, for bringing us this Legendary Hero.  Rocky.  You Will Be Missed...  But loved forever.

I saw the movie recently I thought it was great but not some masterpiece, I feel bad for Brandon Lee, I think the movie is poetic in a way and the story is a good one, and the STP song is good. However, I won't be dressing up like some glam kid(same thing) any time soon.
B002JVWR4U|3.0|Like all Joss Whedon work, Dollhouse is well written and beautifully orchestrated, but there was something about this series that didn't ever really connect with me.  Perhaps it was because Eliza Dushku -- who was unbelievably good as Faith in Buffy and Angel -- is (in spite of Josslove) not really cut out to play the whole variety of characters she was supposed to play.  She has an opacity about her and an offhand style that never really goes away.  She is always Eliza Dushku, and never really transforms. I suspect however there's something about the whole concept for the show that interferes with the audience identifying with the main characters.  I never really care about Caroline/Echo's past or future.   In the end,  her original story is kind of half-baked anyway.  But funnily enough,  it is the innocents, Sierra and Victor, who steal the show, as well as Topher the geek.  As usual in the Whedonverse there are good things here and there: Miracle the big woman (nice to see one as a romantic figure);  Olivia Williams (Cruella de Ville), and the welcome return of Summer Glau and Alexis Denisof; not to mention the change in Alan Tudyk!   Still, somewhere towards the end of season one, one loses one's sense of the whole thing, as the characters and their going back and forth multiply.  There's also a flatness in the filming early on that reminds one of 70s TV (the genre problem).  Compared to Buffy and Angel and Firefly,  there is just a lack of overall emotional connection.   The second season is more action filled, but by then we have seen a lot over and over again:  variations on the chair,  endless halls in empty buildings filled with sudden fighting, etc.  Another problem is that we have seen a whole lot of this story before in other places: Terminator apocalypses and the rest.  This is just such a familiar groove.  The MadMax truck at the very end struck me as something that could be the start of a great idea -- pity it arrives so late.  It may be that the goofy segments in the series are just too short -- Whedon is at his best riffing away.  He works best with a dysfunctional group with a single purpose (e.g. the writers' room as archetype). Dollhouse is designed so no one can be in a group, everyone is so impaired or conspiring.  They cannot gather around Echo or anyone else, which is where Whedonics works its best magic.  There is more energy in Season 2, but there is still this lack of groupness -- bits of it start happening, and then die because of the overall concept. You can see fragments of groupness (meetings in Adele's office,  meetings around Topher,  Victor and his soldier exploit with Sierra and Echo, and so on,  bits, but, to repeat, the Actives have such a struggle to come together because of their constant return to distancing that only partly ebbs). So, for me, there isn't enough group playtime throughout.  Joss W. needs to go back to group playtime.  One hopes that the Avengers will be this kind of playtime.    The reason I give it 3 stars and not less is the last episode of all. This seems to me to redeem a whole lot. Considering that they had to work with an already out there Epitaph One, the thing is a marvel.   Maybe Epitaph One and Two should have been the series.  For Whedon fans they have all kinds of familiar tropes from all of his series (I particularly like the fact that he finally got to shoot the post apocalyptic LA from Angel), but they nevertheless work so effortlessly.  Everything about the editing and cast connecting and reconnecting just flows.  The scene around the kitchen table (the essential Joss Whedon archetype, the group around the table is his touchstone utopia) is a kind of summary statement of every group around a table in Whedonverse, and is more or less what we have been waiting for (sure it is Southern California/American apocalypse ecotopia, but we still go for it).  The foibles and bonding and exposition and sarcasm -- we've seen this a hundred times in Whedonverse, but itis always a beautiful thing.  I watched the whole series in a row on DVD, which was both fun and a chore, but it was worth the work, towards earning the last episode.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I've always been a huge Alice in Wonderland fan, so I was worried about how much I would enjoy this considering all the other awful movies created for this story. I decided to not expect anything from this movie and just enjoy it as a Tim Burton movie, and I loved it. I've been told by some people it didn't make sense to them, and they couldn't get passed the fact that it was about her return to Wonderland. It's sad because if you pay attention there is a good message and character development that is lacking in many movies these days, so I implore anyone who hasn't watched this yet to do so without judgement or preconceptions until completely viewing it. It's a perspective of the original story, so try to give credit to the director for his own creativity.

B00065MDS6|4.0|\\"Lizard\\" is King Crimson's third album, originally released in 1971. Although there had been some lineup changes, not least the departure of lead-singer Greg Lake, most of the original King Crimson psychedelia sound remains intact.<br /><br />The new singer Gordon Haskell can glimpsewise sound like Peter Gabriel, and when instrumentation on several tracks is very similar to Genesis, you'll easily come to think this group in their heyday.<br /><br />Lyricist Pete Sinfield is still with the group and the lyrical themes are still influenced by medieval romance. Musically some songs are relatively easy to go to, being both melodic and fairly subdued - this kind of numbers have always been my favorites in the group.<br /><br />Both \\"Circus\\" and \\"Indoor Games\\" belong to this category - fine numbers, which both challenge and please; not least with a very melodious acoustic guitar. \\"Happy Family\\" is somewhat harder to go to; fortunately this track is relatively short, while the subdued \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" is almost \\"folk\\"; with its acoustic instrumentation - very much Genesis style here.<br /><br />The long \\"Lizard\\" suite, which originally formed side two of the album, begins beautifully with a guest appearance of Jon Anderson of Yes, handling the lead-vocals. This piece, \\"Prince Rupert Awakes\\", is one of the album's highlights; actually it's a shame of you can not hear this number seperately from the rest of  \\"Lizard\\" which can be rather tough listening; not least the final part with some extreme saxphone sounds.<br /><br />The sound is generally great, and as mentioned before, the acoustic guitars sound  crisp and clear - sheer pleasure.
0446563048|4.0|I received an advance blogger copy of Tony Hsieh's Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose in June. Hsieh is best known as CEO of [...], the online shoe source he grew from nothing to more than $1 billion in gross sales, now owned by Amazon. Originally, I planned to review as a general business book. Now that I've repurposed and refocused, I'm reviewing in light of the lessons it holds for health care marketers.<br /><br />Delivering Happiness is perhaps the most charming business book ever - at least of those I've read. Hsieh's strength as an author is his storytelling, beginning with the worm-farm yarn in Chapter 1. Unlike most business writers, by the end of the book we know about Hsieh's childhood entrepreneurial ventures (and failures), how he took advantage of crowdsourcing as a Harvard student to get good grades with little effort on his part and his one-time love of serious poker. It's probably the only book that's turned the PLUR principle Hsieh learned at raves - Peace, Love, Unity, Respect - into a business mantra.<br /><br />And the stories he tells in the first portion of the book make the final third sing. Quite frankly, if Hsieh had just regurgitated his business vision, and thoughts on culture and customer service, in book form, there would be no reason to listen. I mean, come on, who would pay just to read about another company's vision? But because the reader knows Zappos', and Hsieh's, story by the time we get to that part of the book, his talk about the importance of brand and culture really sings.<br /><br />Hsieh's biggest point isn't about business, but life: There has to be meaning behind what you do.  Money alone isn't enough - as he discovered after he walked away at age 24 with $30 million in his pocket after selling a company he co-founded, LinkExchange, to Microsoft. Without passion, there's no satisfaction. Hsieh's underlying message: What companies should be doing is implementing core values, focusing more on customer service, company culture and employee happiness. Those companies that do, according to Hsieh, actually improve their financial performance as well.<br /><br />Health care is perfectly enabled to deliver the kind of passion Hsieh refers to. Like Hsieh, I'm also a sometime student of the burgeoning science of happiness. According to Hsieh, research from the field is confirming that the combination of physical synchrony with other humans and being part of something bigger than oneself leads to a greater sense of happiness. Isn't that what health care is all about?<br /><br />In the final chapter of the book, Hsieh turns his efforts personally to the reader and outlines what is known about the science of happiness. Happiness is really about four things: perceived control, perceived progress, connectedness and being part of something bigger than yourself. One of health care's weaknesses, at least in the acute care environment, is perceived control. I think that's behind a lot of nurse, allied health professional and caregiver burnout.<br /><br />One could say Delivering Happiness is completely choppy - the first third is really Hsieh's story, from Harvard to LinkExchange to venture capitalist and Zappos. The middle third, which is mostly about Zappos, is not really written by Hsieh - he includes segments from at least 12 guest contributors. And the very last chapter is about positive psychology and how to apply it to your life. However, given what we learn about Hsieh starting on page 1, it holds together. It makes sense. That's who he is, what he stands for and what he believes in - the underlying message of the book.lture and employee happiness.

La pareja que forman Villazón y Netrebko es una de las mejores que he visto en escena, tanto en teatro como en cine.     Además de la excelente música, la interpretación es magnífica, hasta lograr conmover en los momentos culminantes. El aria \\"Una furtiva lacrima\\", casi al final, ronda en lo sublime.    Recomiendo este DVD totalmente.

B002K0WBXW|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  For those who haven't seen 'The Proposal', the plot is rather simple.  Faced with being deported to her native Canada, publishing business career woman Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), proposes to her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) that she marry him, in order to save her job and offer him a chance at promotion. The film has been compared to the 2009 dramedy 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Ostensibly, they both are about smug career women who are universally hated by their employees. But Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly is a multi-dimensional portrait based on a real person and Sandra Bullock's 'Margaret Tate' is a dopey caricature.<br /><br />  Many internet posters have condemned 'The Proposal' for its predictability. Sure enough, Margaret Tate eventually comprehends the error of her ways and finally softens up; but it's what happens before the predicable ending (the 'softening up') that relegates the film to the trash heap.<br /><br />  There was a time when Sandra Bullock actually showed some talent as a comic actor. Consider Miss Congeniality--the film was humorous due to the cleverness of the fish out of water premise. Sandra's FBI agent character had to adapt in the prim and proper beauty pageant world. And we were attracted to Sandra since her character was realistically tough and confident.<br /><br />  Not so in 'The Proposal'. You would think that a tough as nails editor-in-chief would know how to handle herself, especially in the rarefied world of the Paxton family--both Tate and the Paxtons are quite well off. But no, Bullock plays Tate as a buffoon, someone to laugh at. Somehow, being in the more rural atmosphere of Sitka, Alaska, is supposed to turn Tate into a total klutz. Not only is she unable to efficiently move her luggage or climb down a ladder but she also can't swim! While Miranda Priestly was arrogant and sometimes petty, she also had an aura of competency that made her an attractive and interesting character. Until her sudden epiphanies toward the climax of 'The Proposal', Tate is completely petty and never shows any sign of competence. Take for example, the idiotic scene where the family dog is snatched by an eagle; eventually Tate saves the dog but she's more concerned about her cell phone, after the eagle flies away with it.<br /><br />  It's easy to understand why Bullock would be attracted to the 'straw man' character of Margaret Tate. As the dictionary tells us--a straw man is a \\"fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person, object, matter, etc., used as a seeming adversary or argument.\\" The shrewd businesswoman that she is, Bullock realizes how the masses (the film going public) despise such characters as Tate, since most of us have encountered such arrogant people one time or another during our employment history. In reality, such people never realize the 'error' of their ways and usually are rewarded for their amoral behavior (take Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada' as the perfect example). Since the masses can't face reality, they would rather indulge in wish fulfillment by cheering on the comeuppance of a straw man. And that's exactly what Bullock has done here--provided a buffoon that the masses can sneer at--while she knows full well that a real tough as nails editor-in-chief would never be anything like a Margaret Tate who \\"hates shopping and sightseeing\\" and hasn't had sex for a year and a half!<br /><br />  Before 'The Proposal' gets all mushy with the failed marriage ceremony and Ryan Reynolds rushing back to NYC where he convinces Bullock that he's truly fallen in love with her, numerous bloggers and internet posters have taken note of many other unfunny scenes in 'The Proposal', that crop up before the sentimental denouement. A few that come to mind include: Bullock and Reynolds clumsily falling over each other while in the nude, Bullock being entertained by an amateur Hispanic 'Chippendale's' stripper and Betty White playing the grandmother dressed up as a Native American, performing a bizarre Native American dance for Bullock (followed by her equally bizarre hip hop dance in response).<br /><br />  Despite Ryan Reynold's sincere performance as Andrew Paxton, the character also doesn't make much sense. Paxton supposedly holds himself as being true to himself (as well as being an anti-materialist) when he rejects his father's demand to come back home and take over the family business. But at the same time, he's willing to compromise his values by accepting Tate's illegal (and immoral) proposal, in order to further his career.<br /><br />  Even if one's 'heart strings' are pulled by the sudden transformation of the lovers' affection for each other at the film's climax, the bulk of 'The Proposal' is 'comedy' of the lowest sort. And Bullock too has hit new lows by agreeing to be part of this enterprise. The next time around, she should look for more excellent screenplays.

0743454537|5.0|Ah, so many people criticize the ending of this book, but in truth, that is what makes it a fabulous read and a real stunner.  Having lived over 60 years and having spent over 32 years in the court system, I can tell you the issues were finely drawn and an intriguing look into today's ethical and social ethos.  There are a handful of cases I've seen that had surprise and tragic endings in REAL life, and this was certainly a valid and believable way to end this novel, notwithstanding people who like to believe that there are ALWAYS fairy-tale endings.  Believe me, folks, there are some very ugly realities and very ugly endings out there, and I applaud Ms. Picoult for not taking the coward's way out.

B003O85W3A|4.0|Let's make no bones about it - like nearly everyone else, I thought Arcade Fire's Funeral  was a debut of startling punch and clarity. I still do. It's an album of dizzying highs thrust between sombre reflections that weren't just there to space out the loud songs, but that took the album's theme and meaning and crafted new textures around it. Hell, I still can't help feeling a bit teary when I remember the Where the Wild Things Are  promo featuring Max and the monsters thundering through the forest to 'Wake Up', one of those near-perfect melds of song and vision that come along every few years or so. And it was only an advertisement for a movie, for God's sake.    You might be tempted to say that not much has changed between drinks for Win and the crew. They still seek the Epic, they're still chasing down the Big Themes. Only now, the albums are six songs longer. This ain't so bad if there's a bit of variation for the listener to stretch out into (see Broken Social Scene's Forgiveness Rock), but if you're going to relentlessly pursue a single mood for more than hour, then you better be serving up some A game. And musically, The Suburbs is almost there. There are a couple of missteps ('Month of May', 'Sprawl I (Flatlands)') and although Butler's voice seems to have much less emotional range, there are a raft of cracking tunes.    But the lyrics. Here's a sample of what you'll hear throughout: The kids. The kids. The kids. The kids. The kids. It's like being stuck in a ghost train made of Robbie Williams and Kylie. \\"So what?\\" you say. \\"Funeral mentioned children an awful lot. Arcade Fire are writing what they've always written.\\" That's true. Funeral's references worked because Arcade Fire were younger, more desperate, more uncertain. They were kids themselves. Now, rather than feeling like Funeral's work of precocious genius, The Suburbs feels like a band that's achieved indie tenure, and worse, that's settled into the role. The constant, knowing drum-banging comes across as trite - even when the lyrics are uncertain, they're certain about that uncertainty.    The Suburbs is still a good album. There are depths here to be explored, and most fans will be happy with it (and probably unhappy with this). But it's not what Arcade Fire are truly capable of. It's telling that one of the best songs is the eponymous outro, all stripped down and regretful instead of rah-rah fist-pumping. It's also three minutes shorter than anything else on here.    3.5 /5 stars    Standout tracks:  Empty Room, Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains), The Suburbs (Continued)

2070360024|5.0|In his Introduction to the first American edition of THE STRANGER (1955), Albert Camus summarized his novel in one sentence: \\"In our society, anybody who does not cry at his mother's funeral, risks to be sentenced to death\\".*) After publication in 1942 in France, the novel achieved notoriety and a kind of cult status for several generations of Camus readers, and was inspiration for philosophers and writers.  Re-reading the novel now, forty years since first delving into Camus' writing, I find it as deeply affecting and thought provoking as then. With the hindsight of close to seventy years since it was written, THE STRANGER is not only a self-portrait of an \\"outsider\\", who appears to be drifting through life without aim or emotional depth.  It is also a harsh critique of a society, reflected in the justice system, that is rigid and controlling and, by extension, overly judgemental towards anybody who is not \\"playing the game\\" or respecting \\"the mechanisms of society\\". Finally, it is also important to keep in mind that the novel was conceived during the devastating war in which Camus, although not in military service, was a politically highly active participant.<br /><br />The novel opens with \\"Today, Maman is dead. Or maybe she died yesterday, I don't know\\". Meursault, the son and narrator of the story, travels to the nursing home for his mother's wake and funeral the next day. In short, simple sentences he describes the bare facts, the people he meets. Feelings? None, apparently. He doesn't even recall his mother's age.  He returns home, meets a former colleague of his and embarks on an affair with her. Life returns to its habitual banality until he is approached by a neighbour for assistance with writing a letter.  From then on events move towards a confrontation that leaves Meursault accused of a crime and leads to trial that, for him, takes place \\"outside of himself\\" but that, at the same time, brings him towards deeper reflection and new understanding of himself and the system that judges him.<br /><br />Set in Algiers, the locale is of little importance, except for the vital role that desert sun, ocean and beach play in the protagonist's life. In its first part, the narrative appears at times superficial and naive and Meursault presents himself as an uninvolved and carefree young man who lives day by day. Nevertheless, the deeper underlying moral and existential questions that come to the fore in the second part may need this slow and detailed build-up developed in the first.<br /><br />In the above mentioned introduction, Camus explained his book's underlying concern that he described to have been at odds with the perception of the readers of the day. Mersault was an \\"outsider\\" in the society where he lived who, at a more profound level, was condemned not for what he did, but for \\"speaking the truth\\". Was he judged for his criminal act or for the challenge challenge to society he embodied?  In fact, during the court proceedings it emerges quickly that his lifestyle and behaviour was on trial.  Meursault's  commentary and his effort to make sense of what he hears during the trial reads today more like a farce, despite its sombre description of the circumstances. At one point the defence counsel, in obvious frustration, shouts: \\"Here, this is the image of this trial. All is true and nothing is true!\\". The ultimate confusion is created when when he imitates and, unintentionally, caricaturizes his client in front of the jury. \\" My fate was being settled without anybody asking my opinion\\", Meursault concludes. His trial spins into a direction that has no longer anything to do with him.<br /><br />What, in the end has made Meursault a \\"stranger\\"? In his musings, he states that he cannot express emotions toward others as they do. Yet, when asked whether he loves his mother, his repeated answer is: \\"yes, like everybody else\\". When accused of the crime, the expression of culpability and regret is alien to him and he states so truthfully: he does not feel guilt, only \\"ennui\\".  What made him act out his crime? \\"The sun\\". Mersault is not an insensitive person, however, he does not have the \\"psyche of a criminal\\" as the prosecutor argues forcefully. Any emotions are indirectly expressed through a related physical activity: attraction to his girlfriend, assistance to his \\"buddy\\", his work ethics, caring for his neighbour. He is most explicit when describing his emotions when outside: walking along the beach with the desert sun burning his face, the hot sand under his bare feet, or when dipping into the refreshing ocean waves. The intensity of light of the desert sun is also playing games with his mind: distorting reality and blurring his vision. In his prison cell he seeks the sun... Meursault describes such sensations on that fateful day on the beach: \\"Sweat runs down my eyebrows and further down into the eyelids[...] My eyes were blinded behind a curtain of tears and salt [...]Everything starts to flicker...\\"  Anybody who has enjoyed traveling in a desert, exposed to the elements will relate, at a minimum, to these sensations.<br /><br />It may be stating the obvious that the way we experience and find expression for our emotions, how we define relationships or life's purpose are deeply personal. Some readers will relate to Meursault, others will find him as \\"strange\\" as his judge and jury did.  Whatever tendency we lean towards, THE STRANGER is worth a thorough reflection and re-assessment.

B003102JDM|1.0|I liked many of the Coen Brothers previous films.  But like many other reviewers, I found this film to be extremely tedious in its trying to get to the point, which is never really made.  I understand that the theme of \\"life can be miserable\\" can make a great movie when done in an entertaining way.  This movie was not.<br /><br />I do appreciate a good black comedy, but usually the point is made somewhere in the film.  Supposedly this is a \\"slice of life\\" kind of movie, but it is a miserable slice at that.  Sure many of the characters are quirky, but why should we care about any of them when they are largely dishonest and/or selfish?  Even, Larry Gopnik (the main character) is so feckless that you stop feeling any sympathy for his plight and really wish he would stand up for something, just once, and begin to show that he is a real man in charge of his own life.  No such luck.  You keep waiting for the emotional pay off, but it never comes.  Perhaps that is their point about life sometimes.  But then why should we care to watch and identify with this man's misery for 105 minutes when he doesn't seem to care enough himself?<br /><br />There are too many loose ends left at the end, with only a foreboding ending scene to make you wonder how this movie could have ended better if the Coen's had really cared enough about their viewers.  It's as if they wrote, directed and produced this film solely for their own personal enjoyment, because there were too many inside jokes and Jewish references that only a select demographic of people could probably appreciate the supposed cleverness that they put into this film.  Perhaps the Coen's have now become too clever for their own good.  This is not for the majority of film-goers.  It can be difficult to watch.  I understand the concept of showing how life can appear to be just a random series of unconnected events.  But why do we want to immerse ourselves in those waters when those are the ones we as viewers are trying to escape from ourselves.  At least give us something more substantial that makes some sense and gives us a feeling that watching this film was worthwhile.<br /><br />From the beginning sequence in Yiddish to the final tornado scene, no attempt is really made to join many of these scenes together.  Even the intriguing story sequence about the dentist and the \\"Goy\\" are left as a mystery in the end as to why they were placed into the film at all.  It seemed totally unrelated to the film.  What's the point?  Another inside joke?  Much is left unexplained.  And thus a rising feeling begins to grow stronger in you as a viewer as the movie plods on.  The kind of feeling you get when you realize that you have sat through this waste of time, wondering what other film you could have watched instead.  No movie magic here, just relentless misery, seemingly unrelated scenes and quirky but unlikeable characters.  However, you are finally relieved when you see the final tornado sequence (also seemingly unfinished) and not really caring anymore what becomes of any of the movie characters, just glad that it is finally over.  This is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" movie.  But if you like \\"downers\\" you are in for a treat.ves.

B002HRTMHQ|5.0|The BEST CD I have heard in years!!!! A lot of new artists could learn from this one: real words, music and harmony!...who would'a thought? And very memorable and sing-a-long songs....ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! It if were an album I would have worn the grooves off by now...
B000GFRDN6|5.0|We all know the album so I will not write on the album itself.  This is the remastered cd and they did a great job.  The sound is so much better than the original released cd.  I must admit I hesitated in purchasing this disc as remastered seems to be more of a word than the actual work into the sound quality of so many cd's nowadays, but the sound here is great. The added bonus songs actually sound pretty good too but the slow version of Rock 'N Me was quite 'different' and really did not care for it.  Now if the remastered sound quality of this disc is not enough, the real surprise is the second disc.<br /><br />You get a dvd of a concert that was done in 2005 and most of the music in the concert sounded fantastic as far as the perfomance went.  There were a few songs Steve struggled on, but overall it was a great concert and over 2 hours long. The overall sound quality was also very good.  Then there is an interview that was was quite interesting also on this disc.  If this is yet enough, how about Dolby 5.1 sound?  The entire cd of songs is presented on this dvd in 5.1 surround sound (minus the 3 bonus tracks) and it literally blows you away.<br /><br />Again, I hesitated on purchasing this set and after getting it, I was impressed and felt it was definately worth the price of about $17 I paid at Amazon.  Now if Capitol will release 'Book Of Dreams' remastered.....
0061714372|5.0|Photographer William (Bill) Hale has added the visual to this autobiography by contributing 22 of the photos (including 5 full page shots and 7 glossy prints) that bring this story to life.  Many of the early Metallica pics appeared first in Metallica The Club Dayz 1982-1984 by Bill Hale, on a higher quality photo paper.  8 early Megadeth photos are from Bill Hale's upcoming photo book titled Megadeth Another Time A Different Place, which is currently in the process of shopping for a publisher.  While his other photos appear only here in Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir!<br /><br />This book is a great read, it is very well written from an honest and humble position.  Dave Mustaine takes full responsibility for the choices and the mistakes he has previously made in this lifetime.  He reveals very intimate details about the quality of his life and the long and winding road that he traveled to reach a place where the healing could begin.  I laughed out loud at some of these stories and felt a deep compassion as I read about some of his experiences.  I found myself rooting for his recovery and wanting to say \\"no don't do it!!\\" every time he fell back into the black abyss of depression and drug/alcohol addiction.  I had no interest in judging any of his actions but could hear how hard he was fighting those natural urges to continue on with these self destructive behaviors.  It's difficult for people who did not come from dysfunctional or broken homes to completely understand this struggle.  Nurture can only make up for a small amount of the nature we inherit and if the nurture was not there then it is a long, sometimes seemingly impossible struggle to find a peace that you have never known but have read about or seen in someone else.  I commend Dave for bearing his soul for all to see and thank him on behalf of the many other people who have deeply ingrained troubles to overcome.<br /><br />We love you Dave, YOU ROCK!!

This album is pure gold from beginning to end (except maybe Month of May, but I promise it'll grown on you after three or four plays).  The lyrics are fantastic, Win Butler's vocals are incredible as usual, the same with Regine Chassagne, plus the synth-pop meets arena rock sound add in a few violins, an accordion, and a glockenspiel create an unreconstrucable sound which is pure ecstasy for the ears.

0066620996|5.0|Normally I hate to read corporate books and what makes a great leader and a great company. Even though Good to Great belongs in this genre, I simply love it, because it is in total line with how I have thought for most my adult life. In order to be great (as individual or company) you have to have a hedgehog concept. What is that? Here's a quote from the book    Are you a hedgehog or a fox? In a famous essay \\" The Hedgehog and the Fox,\\" Isaiah Berlin divided the world into hedgehogs and foxes, based upon an ancient Greek parable: \\"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. The fox is a cunning creature, able to devise a myriad of complex strategies for sneak attacks upon the hedgehog. Day in and day out, the fox circles around the hedgehog's den, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. Fast, sleek, beautiful, fleet of foot, and crafty- the fox looks like the sure winner. The hedgehog, on the other hand, is a dowdier creature, looking like a genetic mix-up between a porcupine and a small armadillo. He waddles along, going about his simple day, searching for lunch and taking care of his home.  The fox waits in cunning silence at the juncture in the trail. The hedgehog, minding his own business, wanders right into the path of the fox.  \\"Aha, I've got you now!\\" thinks the fox. He leaps out, bounding across the ground, lightning fast. The little hedgehog, sensing danger, looks up and thinks, \\"Here we go again. Will he ever learn?\\" Rolling up into a perfect little ball, the hedgehog becomes a sphere of sharp spikes, pointing outward in all directions. The fox, bounding toward his prey, sees the hedgehog defense and calls off the attack. Retreating back to the forest, the fox begins to calculate a new line of attack. Each day, some version of this battle between the hedgehog and the fox takes place, and despite the greater cunning of the fox, the hedgehog always wins.  Berlin extrapolated from this little parable to divide people into two basic groups: foxes and hedgehogs. Foxes pursue many ends,at the same time and see the complexity. They are \\"scattered or diffused, moving on many levels,\\" says Berlin, never integrating their thinking into one overall concept or unifying vision. Hedgehogs,on the other hand, simplify a complex world into a basic principle. It doesn't matter how complex the world is, a hedgehog reduces all challenges and dilemmas to simple-  concept that unifies the world into an almost simplistic hedgehog idea. For a hedgehog, anything that does not somehow relate to the hedgehog idea holds no relevance.      What is a hedgehog idea and how do you get one? Another quote  Hedgehog Concept is a simple, crystalline concept that flows from deep understanding about the intersection of the following three circles:  1. What you can be the best in the world at (and, equally important, what you cannot be the best in the world at). This discerning standard goes far beyond core competence. Just because you possess a core competence doesn't necessarily mean you can be the best in the world at it. Conversely, what you can be the best at might not even be something in which you are currently engaged.  2. What drives your economic engine. All the good-to-great companies attained piercing insight into how to most effectively generate sustained and robust cash flow and profitability. In particular, they discovered the single denominator- profit per x- that had the greatest impact on their economics.   3.What you are deeply passionate about. The good-to-great companies focused on those activities that ignited their passion. The idea here is not to stimulate passion but to discover what makes you passionate.      Is it easy to answer the three questions in these three circles? No it's not. It is something that usually takes years, although for some people it happens in a moment of great awareness. Another quote    Despite its vital importance (or, rather, because of its vital importance), it would be a terriblemistake to thoughtlessly attempt to jump right to a Hedgehog Concept. You can't just go off-site for two days, pull out a bunch of flip charts, do breakout discussions, and come up with a deep understanding. Well, you can do that, but you probably won't get it right. It would be like Einstein saying, \\"I think it's time to become a great scientist, so I'm going to go off to the Four Seasons this weekend, pull out the flip charts, and unlock the secrets of the universe.\\" Insight just doesn't happen that way. It took Einstein ten years of groping through the fog to get the theory of special relativity,and he was a bright guy. It took about four years on average for the good-to-great companies to clarify their Hedgehog Concepts. Like scientific insight, a Hedgehog Concept simplifies a complex world and makes decisions much easier. But while it has crystalline clarity and elegant simplicity once you have it, getting the concept can be devilishly difficult and takes time. Recognize that getting a Hedgehog Concept is an inherently iterative process, not an event.

Even from the perspective that this is Jacob's movie, it lacks the edginess that characterized the first two albums.  During the first movie I sat up in my seat and LISTENED to the TWILIGHT soundtrack.  I mean, \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\"?  Fabulous!  The songs by Paramore? Wonderful!  \\"Full Moon\\" by the Black Ghosts?  Delightful. (Incidently, their album is great, too.  Not on this album but an undeniable asset to the movie was Radiohead's \\"Fifteen Steps.\\"  And, of course, Pattinson himself, although I wish the track was \\"Let Me Sign\\" instead, but I'll take what I can get.  The NEW MOON C/D had \\"Shooting The Moon\\" with its surprisingly big finish. \\"Monsters\\" had me moving.  \\"Rosyln\\" and \\"Slow Life\\" weren't edgy but they were innovative and unique.  ECLIPSE in contrast can only point to \\"Chop and Change\\" as having any meat to it.  \\"Heavy in Your Arms\\" was the other track that even remotely caught my interest.  Everything else was just there.  When you consider that ECLIPSE was leading up to an intense vampire war, what's with such an uninspiring soundtrack?  When I go to the movies, I want the music to HEIGHTEN my experience.  I want it to BE THERE, subliminally tugging at my attention while I'm engrossed in the action on the big screen. I want to mentally register that \\"Hey! This is a cool song!\\" without taking my eyes off the action.  I want to search the end credits for the name of the band and the track.  That being said, not one song on the ECLIPSE soundtrack aroused that curiosity in me.  It flat missed the boat.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|An intriguing political thriller that follows the footsteps of a ghostwriter about to discover an earth-shattering truth about the ex-prime minister of England. The film is beautifully filmed, with dark grays and hues of bleakness appropriate to its thematic implications. The ending is a given but is still surprising to watch. This is a highly engaging film to watch but is not a film I would watch more than once.
B003IWYOF4|4.0|I saw this today and was very impressed with the picture quality. Considering the film stock and lenses used, it looks fantastic. This is definitely the best that the film has ever looked, other than at the theater. Colors are natural, blacks deep, detail as much as there can be with the elements used, and there are very few print artifacts; those that are there pass so quickly that they don't intrude on the proceedings. There is a fine sheen of film grain that is supposed to be there, without a hint of digital manipulation. If this is an old HD master that was used for the HD-DVD, I would say that it still looks really good. It couldn't get much better than it this, image-wise.  My only complaint would be the sound. I believe that The Breakfast Club was in mono when it came out, so everything spills from the center channel with a bit of spread to the other channels. Dialogue sounds muffled and dated, which makes me wonder if Universal couldn't have gone back to the original masters and remixed the audio for a more articulated and defined sound. A lot can be done with the computer technology today and I wish it would've been utilized here. Other than that, I am very happy to see this classic from my youth in such great shape. I definitely recommend this to fans of the film. It is a worthy upgrade from the DVD releases.
B0025KVLVA|4.0|The remastering on this is great, but inconsistent. They could have went further. Also, why leave the early stereo recordings which were recorded for mono with vocals on one side and music on the other? It's annoying and unlistenable. It sounds great, but they should have centered the vocals. That's not changing the music. It's mixing it properly. It's a lost opportunity. If most people didn't have these stereo versions and they weren't meant for stereo why not?
0446691437|5.0|This book is valuable for all of us who are artists.  We need to be reminded over and over again that Resistance IS the enemy.  Period.
B0025KVLUG|4.0|The packaging is gorgeous, but the remastering is inconsistent and they could have went further. The George Martin score sounds incredible though. They really should have went all out like they did on the package.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|Very disappointed with this year's release. only 8 tracks which account to barely half an hour and the music is not that great.  actually, what happened to the Keane we love?  \\"your love\\" and \\"my shadow\\" are the only tracks that remind a bit of the Keane I fell in love with since \\"somewhere only we know\\". I think they need to go back to what made them successful and start over.   I see a lot of asian and african influences, some hip hop even. but guys, you are british pop!  just stick to that.  don't try to cater to all the world.    I hope next album release brings us back to the beginning.  I understand you need to evolve as a band, but the idea is to evolve within a Keane style. don't drop that.  it's what we fans love you for.
B003FK8V7G|3.0|I've learned to really enjoy Gaslight Anthem's music. 59 Sound was first purchase. Loved the music and worked my way back through older releases. Liked them all, but 59 Sound was/is the best of the lot to me. American Slang is good, but still not up to 59 Sounds overall standard. Maybe I just had too much anticipation, after 59 Sound. If you're going to buy just one CD by GA, buy 59 Sound: work out from there.
193413712X|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  But, I didn't.  I finished it, but never got to the point where I could get through more than 10 pages without stopping to count how many more I still had left before it was over with.  Too disjointed, way too many random details (I couldn't take it anymore and started skimming over the random paragraphs about nest building, etc.)  Even when the story became somewhat more interesting, I couldn't get totally into it:  I found it too hard to believe that George was having memories of memories that Howard had about his own father, someone George had never met.  It made no sense.  As others have already commented, it seemed to lack character development.  I never felt any connection to George, despite the intimacy of having been with him at his deathbed.  This book may very well deserve more than two stars, just not from me.  I guess it was just over my head.
B003MX5P20|3.0|This CD is a bunch of mid-tempo dance songs in english with piano melodies mixed with some spanish songs that were ok. He's done better than this. I wasn't too impressed overall.
B000VS6R26|5.0|The Movie was great. How ever you give a person 3 to 4 days to buy something else with an discount I thing you sould extent it a month. People would buy more from you. I don't think I will be back.
B002ZG991S|5.0|I sure hope that when this is released on Blu-Ray, they release it in 3D! Otherwise, forget it!
B0035F0MTG|5.0|Yuji Wang's performance is superb.  Her technical skill and musicality are first class. She is a rare talent and this recording is a gem.
B001M0B740|1.0|I ordered an audio tape for my Brother's Birthday and after 4 weeks, had still not received it.  I was told 2-3 weeks. I had to cancel my order, purchase it from another vendor and apologize to my brother that his present would be late.
B00001W9G0|5.0|How can you not get swept away with the performances of Barbra and Robert Redford!
1597801585|3.0|This was a very well written and thought out Sci-Fi novel, but that's what it was.  I read this on recommendation of a friend who said it was a great novel, not just a good Sci Book, but a great novel.  So I went into it with the mindset that this was a Cormack McCarthy, Geoffery Eugenides, or Phillip Roth level novel, and it was not.    It was OK, not terrible, but not great.
B002SG8A56|5.0|Dude how cam you not love fotc?? Sad they didn't come back for the 3rd season but awesome show awesome deal!!!
B003LAH7MU|3.0|Sting now adds his name to the list of folks who re-imagine their material with an orchestra (Ben Folds, Linda Ronstadt, and others did it first) and what comes out is an album that's nice to listen to, but at the end of the day it's not really necessary. Seriously, I listened to it once and I was surprised at the lack of imagination in how these songs were done. I thought the tango version of \\"Roxanne\\" included in MOULIN ROUGE was way more exciting than this and I just saw Idina Menzel sing a jazz version in concert that was far more entertaining than what's on the CD here. Sting is a virtuouso (or was...) arranger; why didn't he do more to heighten the orchestra and set the songs to new tempos and arcs for dramatic impact? I'm sure the live shows of this set are fun, but I cannot imagine listen to this more than once and saying \\"Gee, I need to get out my old Police CDs\\" and never pulling this CD out again. It's the kind of CD you put on iTunes and let the device randomly play and then you hit the FORWARD button within seconds because the song just never lets the original out of your psyche. It's been years since Sting released original material that truly captured your attention--this CD, along with that awlfully boring Christmas collection, begins to showcase the end of what was once a truly exciting career. Maybe Sting should stop intellectualizing and find his former bandmates to duke out a more vibrant piece of work.
B001992NW4|5.0|Hi.My name is Paula Bettencourt.  I'm a big movie buff.  And for years now I've had the exorcist on DVD.  I've just ordered the Blu-Ray disc because ever since I got my Blu-Ray player with my new flat panel TV.  I've come to believe that Blu-Ray is a better format then DVD.  However I still don't really mind watching DVD and I still have a great deal of respect for the DVD format/but I've been finding that movies that mean the most to me I'd rather have on Blu-Ray.  To get to the point.I think the exorcist is miss laballed as a horror movie.  I think what the exorcist is is a good VS evil movie.  That only RE-enforces a person's faith in God.  It's sad that the younger generation is too jaded to take the Exorcist seriously.  The Exorcist is one of My favorite movie's and I think it's also a very important movie.  In a faithless age we need the Exorcist mor then ever befor.!!
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|For me, Portishead's Third invites comparison to Radiohead's Kid A. They both have a determined obsession with sound and production in their respective attempts to chronicle the feeling of an alienated urban society. But whereas Kid A had moments of warmth, Third is unrelentingly bleak. If anything, it is even more provocative and challenging. It is neurotic in the extreme, with Beth Gibbons' voice almost uncomfortably high in the mix, and the paranoia reaches breaking point on closer 'Threads'. But for moments of pure gorgeousness, look no further than 'The Rip'. Whether you like it or not, this release demands attention.
B002VECLVO|5.0|I loved this DVD!!!!  I read the book and that just made me want to see the DVD.  Although the DVD has some departures from the book, I believe that this is due to the different medium.  Nevertheless, it is faithful to the overall story.  The acting is superb by all the cast.
0446310786|5.0|I first read this when I was about 12 and thought it was great.  I'm 53 now and just reread it, and my appreciation has only increased.      It's not just the beautiful evocation of life in a small Southern town (with delicious pies and cakes constantly coming out of someone's oven), the poignant moral dilemma of racism, the tight plot, or the unforgettable characters.  For me it's the pitch-perfect voice of Scout, one of the great characters in literature.  Of course Atticus is great too - this should be required reading for all expectant fathers - and the movie places much focus there, but the novel puts you inside Scout's mind and that is a fine place to be.      When I was looking for a copy I stopped in a small used book store, having found that many regular stores were sold out (I guess because of the recent publicity).  The used bookstore was sold out too, but the woman there said \\"Harper Lee only wrote one book, but she said everything she needed to say in it.\\"  That feels about right.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|I owned the LP version of this for many years, and now the CD version finally since I don't play LP's anymore. Sound is great.
0393312836|4.0|seriously an awesome book. i could not put it down and nerdily finished it in two days  haha....many people think that the \\"nadsat\\" slang makes it very hard to read but it really doesnt...it brings you more into the story and makes it more realistic imo, different generations have different slang, a young gangster might use yo and nigguh [just giving examples i love black people haha] while an elderly man might say...youngster or...whippersnapper [biased there im not close with any old men so i wouldnt know for sure]   and anyways you get used to it and if you can connect fruit and a picture of an orange you will get it in a couple of chapters. ok on to the story....easily one of the best out there, it was very original and...gritty is the only word i can find...it doesnt leave much for you to imagine.  the characters are very memorable and make you really feel for them [and hate them at some points] [ok many points]. it has two deep meanings [depending on the edition you get] *****MAYBE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***** one being that people are bad and always so, dont trust anybody, and do whatever it takes to do what feels right to you. the other one= everybodys really good on the inside and you just need to grow up and out of your stupid kid ways. either one is good but i recommend the latter its how its supposed to be read haha. wonderful book, definitely a must read for anyone [maybe not small children] and thats all i gotta say! thankss
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never been much of a fan of workout dvds, but I decided to get this one after watching a preview copy from my local library.  This is a tough, no-nonsense workout, using moves we all learned in high school gym - no complicated footwork, fancy choreography, or specialized equipment - the only things you need are a couple of hand weights and an exercise mat.   Her instructions are clear and concise, and the best thing is that she doesn't have a perky aerobics-instructor grin pasted on her face the entire time.  The backup dancers do tend to grin a bit, but the grins fade as the workout progresses.  You will be completely covered in sweat by the end of a 20-minute session even if you can only manage a 70% effort (I have to modify the jumping jacks because of a dodgy knee).  If you have limited time to work out, and want to make the most of the time you do have, then this is the dvd for you.
0307454541|1.0|This book has 2 plots that runs in parallel:<br /><br />1) disappearance of a girl<br />2) corporate conspiracy<br /><br />Both plots unravel in a single chapter in the most mundane and predictable way.  This is what gets the book a 1 star.  If this was made into a movie, it would be the type of movie that you see on the Lifetime channel with B actors and requires very little budget (you won't find any bombs or car chases in this movie).<br /><br />The book doesn't pick up until halfway through.  For the most part, the main character is researching the disappearance of a girl, and the narrative pretty much repeats itself over and over with slight variations:  Bloomkivst  woke up at 8:00, had lunch at 1:00 (gee it's cold outside), went through photos until 5:00, ate dinner at 7:00, had sex at 10, slept late until 2:00 looking at more photos.  Imagine 100+ pages of that narrative, which most of this book is about.<br /><br />There's nothing about the \\"girl with the dragon tatoo\\" that makes her special -- nothing she does in this book is overtly clever.  She's simply a girl who knows the all parts inside a laptop, that's all.<br /><br />The details in this book is also amazing, and I don't mean that in a good way.  Before the plot even goes anywhere, you're presented with an entire ancestry tree with dozens and dozens of names which later on have NO bearing or relevance in the book.  There are no more than 6-8 main characters in the book, but you'll encounter over 30 names from cousins to aunts to great grandfathers.  I mean, seriously???<br /><br />Finally, maybe this is how most europeans behave, but the characters in this book have sex with each other like hamsters in a box.  They have sex as if they were shaking hands.  All of the characters in this book need to see a psychiatrist about love, sex, and relationships in general.
0316098337|4.0|The tour de force here is Emma Donoghue's amazing ability to write from the perspective of a five year old boy. The plot is secondary to the internal and external dialogue Jack has during a very challenging set of circumstances. I don't often gravitate towards this kind of thing as it can seem boring after the first few pages, but that is typically because it's so obviously a device rather than an art form.    It takes a special kind of talent to achieve what Ms. Donoghue has: provide a fascinating glimpse into childhood. After all, once we eclipse a certain stage, especially when it comes to verbalizing our perceptions, we seldom feel the urge to revisit those less evolved periods. In fact, unless we have brain damage, it's extremely unlikely we will spend time trying to remember how we perceived the world when we were five.     You might think 321 pages of this would become tedious, but, between Jack's emotional and cognitive changes and the plot, I found it held my interest to the end.     By the way, if the tags \\"suspense, kidnapping, thriller\\" put you off, let me assure you this is not a particularly scary book.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|James Cameron in my opinion is a egotistical director that really isn't that talented.     Avatar Sucked. Titanic was Cheesy, Aliens was no where near as revolutionary or original as Alien, yet this Jerk thinks he can make negative reactions to every movie that comes up against his. Sure his movies make tons of money. That means nothing to me. The stories are predictable and campy. That \\"I See You\\" line in Avatar was the stupidest thing I've ever heard, Plus the element called unobtainium....are you joking! That is so retarded. Just because his movies make money doesn't always mean it's a great movie (Let's remember Brittany Spears sold Millions of albums, are any of those really great albums or are they just marketed well?), In his case it is just that he has the money to spend on marketing and building up hype for his films. I admit he does do that well. I loved the Burger King commercials for Avatar, where a burger magically appears between the female and male lead characters...real classy to let your work be marketed like that James! But for money he does it and it sells tickets. Then this Idiot has the nerve to attack films like Terminator Salvation, Clash of the Titans and other films because they are competition, and because he thinks he is the best director in the world. What a pompous loser.     All I got from this movie was bad acting, cheesy lines, way overdone special effects that often times just looked like a video game, and an ultra predictable plot line. It was not original, it just fed off scifi films that were before it that did it better. Even though this film seemed to be so popular the vast majority of people I talk to were disappointed by it.     I think James Cameron needs to let some of the air out of his over inflated fat head. That's probably why BP laughed him out the door when he proposed a plan to stop the oil leak in the Gulf. This idiot is so fat-headed he thinks he can fix the worlds problems. Maybe we can plug up the leak with some unobtainium you dummy! I guarantee you this will all be revealed when he releases Avatar 2 in 2012. I can't wait to see what that piece of crap is going to be like. I bet the sales are no where near the first one because now people know how weak this story is. By the time they get to Avatar 3 this series will have fizzled out.
030726999X|4.0|I thought this book was excellent but not nearly as well put together as the first two. It's definitely worth the read, and the ending alone is worth wading through the few chapters that go on and on. If you've already read the first two I doubt you'll be able to resist the temptation of the third and final installment anyway, so Enjoy!
B00288KNL8|5.0|One of those movies that recall what made the 1931 films \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\" dear to both young and old audiences, and just like the edited versions of such fairy tales like \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\", \\"Hansel and Gretel\\", and \\"The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids\\", \\"Coraline\\" is a traditional, classical horror movie that features no blood, no guts, no swearing, a building terror, an unnerving reality, and lastly the birth and maturity of a hero that learns to be careful what she wishes for.    Never let the cutesy look and stop-motion animation aspects fool you: Director Henry Selick and writer Neil Gaimen create a worthy realm filmed with cautious intrigue and moral parables that move perfectly in the vain of any Brothers Grim story. As much as children will be awed, the classical subtexts can play on the imagination of adults as well, reminding them how truly evil the bad guys in some of these children's stories can be. There is enough creative depth here to capture the imagination of both young and old.    As with the Single-Disc Edition w/3D: it is a two sided disk, one side plays the 2D version, the other the 3D version, and they come with 3D glasses for four. Beside that, there is only a commentary track. Usually such DVDs that lack even a behind-the-scenes feature or twenty is not worth it. On the other hand, when you think about it, what else is there to learn? You know Dakota Fanning and Ian McShane are providing voices, and Selick had directed Tim Burton's \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\". Sometimes, a very bad movie that goes to DVD has so many extras on it they're better than the movie; other times, the extras overshadow even the good movies. The common theme of this DVD reflects the movie and it works: simple, simplicity, and lets just get right down to watching the movie, not the trailers.    For the sake of simplicity in movie watching, and for those who enjoy a horror movie for the whole family as the classical horror movies do, \\"Coraline\\" is a must have in your collection.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Its about time!! I have rented all of these movies in HD on Zune at home and was not let down with the Transfer. I would only assume that it would be greater on BLURAY but we all know what happens when you ass-u-me. Its a gamble buying older movies on BLURAY but this one looks like it will be well worth it. Let me know guys and girls when you get this on BLURAY if the Transfer is good! Thanks for reading.
0545123283|4.0|I am torn with loving this book and wanting to throw it against the wall! There is such suspense, and there is a new character that at first I wish would just disappear, but then, of course, I start to care about him and wonder what he will do next.<br />Grace is still lovable, and mostly opposite of me, but she also learns to stand up for herself in regards to her parents.<br />Sam is still drool worthy (by his physical description, his love, and big bonus he is a musician). Although he is one for ignoring issues that he really should face.<br />Part of me wanting to throw the book was the pace of the beginning, but once you get about halfway through, you understand the pacing, and why details were focused on more than you wanted when all you wanted to do was read about Sam and Grace's relationship.<br />Also, I wish that Isabel and Cole's POV was more distinctive. They have their own personalities, but often, because it is written from 1st person, I get very confused as to who is talking.<br />And, what a cliffie-- I have such a bittersweet relationship with series, because I am left with this longing----
030745455X|5.0|This was a fabulous book but make sure to read all three of the books in the order they are written.  It will make more sense.  It was hard to put the book down once I started it.  Loved it!
B0018BF1KY|5.0|There are five albums here, three of which are Gallagher classics, and since Rory G. never put out any bad albums, the other two are fine, just fine. Really, if the only reason you picked this up was to score a copy of Deuce, it would be well worth your money, since Deuce usually goes for $25 or more. But look here, you get five albums of some of the best guitar slinging you'll ever hear, all for less than $20 from most vendors. No classy packaging, but that shouldn't be much of an issue. Every RG album I owned was pretty bare bones on the packaging. Too bad Blueprint or Tattoo aren't included, but you can't have everything. You like blues/rock guitarists? This is about as much of a must have as I can think of. You won't regret this one.
0307454541|1.0|I'm a mom and don't get much time to read, but this book came so highly recommended that I moved it to the top of my pile.  I can't believe I wasted so much time on it.  I'm no prude, and I have loved violent movies, but this book went way beyond what was necessary to move the plot forward.
B000E8NQUE|4.0|When the original seven albums by the MB's were released I was in my teens and they were favorites of mine and most of my friends(especially the first four). This album, and To Our Children's Children's Children were high water marks that delivered on the promise of the previous two albums. Beginning with A Question of Balance, I was beginning to lose some of my initial enthusiasm, and one hearing of \\"Procession\\" on EGBDF, was enough to convince me that they had become far too deep for their own good. I've never liked the single from Seventh Sojourn (\\"Singer in a Rock 'n' Roll Band\\") because it sounded like they were phoning it in. Another reason for my growing distance was that I was now in college and had convinced myself that my tastes were now more sophisticated and refined. Thankfully, I got over that stage pretty quickly when I realized that what one listens to does not define character, but by that time I had sold my MB albums and saw no reason to revisit them. Until recently, I just viewed them as a low grade progressive-lite  group, in the same league as Yes and Genesis. While both of those groups have done some wonderful music, they have also been responsible for some incredibly indulgent claptrap. Honestly, no offense meant to fans, because even my all-time favorites like the Kinks, The Who, Stones, (and many others) have been guilty of this, but I'm more indulgent there because I tend to listen to progressive rock with a more critical ear. I've just never been a huge fan except for the whole Canterbury Era and King Crimson.       Awhile ago I picked up an SACD version of To Our Children's...and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the surround mix is nice, even though it's actually a quad mix, but as much as I enjoy 5.1, it was the album itself that impressed me. We often throw the baby out with the dishwater, and I'm sure guilty of that. Threshold is pretty much a pleasure from beginning to end. Actually, it is the beginning that still makes me cringe, as it has not aged well at all, but the second that \\"Lovely To See You\\" comes spilling out in a swirl of sound, I felt like I'd re-connected with an old friend. I'm not going to make any judgments on the mastering, as I'm only qualified in saying that it's never sounded so crisp, but then again, I haven't heard it since the 1970's. It's been re-released several times since then, and I haven't heard any of those mixes. You'll need a player that recognizes SACD to get the surround mix. As the album continued, most every song still kind of reminded me of patchouli oil but I can't criticize it for being part of a particular time warp. In the wrong mood, this stuff could still make me wince a bit, but overall, if you've avoided them for years like I did, you might be pleasantly surprised. Not every song is great, but none are horrible, and the kiss off of \\"Have You Heard\\" is still  psych classic. I have to admit that after a session with this album, I feel the need for something with a bit more  substance (and bite) but that doesn't detract from my enjoyment anymore.        At this rate I'm going to have to go back and pick up Days and Chord, because even though this is somewhat of a guilty pleasure, it's one I'm glad to get re-acquainted with. Hands down though, the one to get first is still Children's Children. So now, I guess I have to go back and give Yes and Genesis a fair listen. Someday.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|Good sequel. Didn't surpass the first one, but I didn't expect It to. It's great to see the brothers back in action again. Great quality blu ray, lots of special features. Recommended buy. Also If you haven't seen it yet, part one is five stars across the board awesome. The vulgarity, the shooting, action scenes, they're all unmatched till this day. (in my opinion) Especially Rock \\"the funny guy\\" is great fun to watch. Go buy them, go watch them, join the sensation!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Seriously, WATCH THIS SHOW!<br /><br />I went through the entire series in about 4 days flat.  My only gripe is that there aren't more than 2 seasons!  (although there is a movie in the works!!!!)<br /><br />Packaging was fantastic, not a mark or blemish on the whole thing.  All discs played perfectly.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in ancient Rome, then this series is a MUST SEE!
0143118420|2.0|So a woman who can't come to terms with why her selfishness drives everyone away   runs off to various lands to escape her problems and in the process weaves a   semi-interesting tale because she is tall, attractive, blond and a \\"writer\\"? Isn't this  more t.v. movie territory?    I realize that many great stories begin with a journey  of self-discovery, such as the one this author purports to have written. However, the  protagonist is generally someone very young or one who has been through  many tragic,  life-altering trials. Instead we are given a  pampered thirty-something on an endless  crying jag.     A young woman who embarks on a journey of self-discovery by romping haphazardly through  three varied and distinct lands in search of nourishment, enlightenment and love should be an enjoyable  tome at least, and it probably would be in the hands of a capable writer. What we are  left with, instead, is a story written by a troubled \\"artist\\"  who needs a swift kick in the pants and about ten years of therapy.    If you're over-thirty and still don't get what responsibility is, still don't get how not  to trample on people's emotions in pursuit of your own \\"fulfillment\\", still don't get faith   exists in one's own heart and can't be told to you by another, then you don't deserve my time  or sympathy much less a book/movie deal. Know thyself. By thirty-four, that's your job.  If you don't than maybe go to Greece and visit the Oracle of Delphi. BTW, Julia and Javier  Bardem? Weren't Reba and James Brolin available?
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season is definitely a solid and enjoyable season. The thing about Desperate Housewives, the first half of the season is always stronger than the last half. I am not really sure why that is but I still think this campy show is loads of fun! I loved the unexpected chemistry between Bree and Carl, too bad things didn't end well for one them! I also liked the storyline with that sensitive but deeply troubled, Eddie. The way Lynnette took him under his wing was quite moving even though she couldn't save him from hurting others in the process. But the one storyline that I thought was quite strange was the emotional collapse of Katherine, parts were good and others were a head-scratcher. Overall, season 6 turned out to be better than I could've hoped for. Can't wait for Season 7!
B002BWP4A6|4.0|This is a superb film and worthy of all the praise placed upon it but I'm left scratching my head as to the lack of extras on the DVD version.  In fact, the only \\"extra\\" to speak of is the trailer.  Here is a list of the extras on the Blu-ray version:    Making of The White Ribbon  Michael Haneke: My Life (a 50-minute biopic)  Cannes Film Festival Premiere  An Interview with Michael Haneke    I guess this is Sony's way of telling us have-nots to get off our duffs and go buy one of their Blu-ray players so we can watch their Blu-ray release.  Isn't life grand??  The only reason I rated the film so highly is because it was indeed an epic film but if I had my druthers I'd give Sony's DVD version a big fat zero.
B003D83DPA|5.0|Great sound. The video quality is not excellent but this show is from the early 80´s. The extras are nice too. Worth buy it.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|This review is based wholly on the Blu-Ray box set. There are many Rambo box sets out there and rest assured there will be more. I chose to upgrade to this set because the collection with all 4 movies does not contain the new Rambo Extended Cut. If you don't know Rambo's story than you are either A. a tree hugging hippie, B. a monk, or C. born within the last 10 years!<br /><br />First Blood is a 5 star movie based on the book by David Morrell. It tells the story of a Vietnam vet looking to find a place in America. Unable to hold a steady job and tormented by POW nightmares, Rambo moves from place to place. When he finds himself in a nowheresville USA, he quickly catches the eye of the town sheriff. Told that his kind isn't wanted there, he is taken out of the town limits and told not to return. Rambo defies the order and is arrested. Rambo is then beaten by the local police while in holding which triggers his instincts to fight back. What happens next is the start of a film icon!<br /><br />First Blood Part II is a 5 star action movie! I would say this may be the first Blockbuster Action Film ever made. Now in prison for his town romp, Col. Trautman returns to give Rambo an out. A mission to go back to 'Nam and confirm the possible existence of POW's. Rambo accepts and utters these words \\"Do we get to win this time?\\" Ordered only to take pictures, Rambo defies orders (see a trend here) and saves one of them instead. The backstabbing politician running the whole thing freaks and aborts the mission leaving Rambo stranded and now a POW. Alas, held by his captors and tortured by the Russians running the camp, Rambo endures more punishment that only fuels his rage. What happens next is probably the greatest one man army display ever filmed! From the jungles scenes to the finale, you will feel the rush and cheer!<br /><br />First Blood Part III is a 3.5 star action movie. This time Rambo is living a peaceful life in Thailand. Col. Trautman finds him and asks for his help on a mission he is leading in Afghanistan. Rambo claims his war is over but that all changes once his only ally becomes a POW. Rambo asks to go in and save his friend. What happens next is he finds himself drawn to the Afghan freedom fighters and decides to pick up their plight against the Russians. This is by far the weakest of all the films but still ranks better than most action movies today.<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: I wasn't expecting much but all 3 films looked amazing. No this isn't like Avatar amazing but these films are over 20 years old and they looked brand new. Sound was excellent as well. SPECIAL FEATURES: Everything from the previous releases are here. Including the alt ending where Rambo kills himself as in the book. FINAL THOUGHTS: THIS IS A MUST UPGRADE!ding in Afghanistan.

0823003590|4.0|I agree with other reviewers' praise for this book; not only is it a sound guide to particularities of face portraits, but it is one of the best general drawing books I've seen for someone who has some experience but is struggling with modeling forms realistically.  I would kill for an equally clear and careful introduction to charcoal landscapes.  One minor criticism: the book should end on p. 121.  Everything thereafter is of no use whatsoever to the main purpose of the book.    Maughan's approach, while eventually applicable to, say, charcoal drawing on white paper, sticks very narrowly to red and white chalk drawings on toned paper (a very traditional technique: aux deux crayons, le matite rossa e nera).  I think this is an effective pedagogical choice, and readers will benefit from following it.  Maughan's version of this is to use CarbOthello \\"pastel\\" pencils in the colors red caput mortuum (not martuum as Maughan consistently misspells it) and titanium white.    Well, as I say, the lessons depend on the materials, and it's always fun to buy the materials for a new book you plan on taking seriously, so my whole motivation in writing this review is to share a discovery, which is that the ideal pencil for Maughan's requirements is actually [[ASIN:B0028D8OOQ Koh-i-noor's La Gioconda Red Chalk Pencil]] (widely available from good art suppliers).  It's the same color and material (more or less) as the CarbOthello caput mortuum red but allows so much more and easier tonal control, from very dark to whisper-soft.  (I actually ordered half a dozen of the CarbOthellos before I found out that the single La Gioconda I had sitting around was a better version of the same.)
B002ZG980U|4.0|This movie has it's pros and cons. Here's what my wife and I think.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. There's a lot of action. Lots of excitement and unexpected surprises.<br />2. The acting was top notch. DiCaprio is a genius and the rest of the cast was fantastic.<br />3. The special effects were mind bending, imaginative and well done.<br />4. The concept of conscious dreaming and invading someone else's dreams to manipulate them is both fascinating and frightening. The story was deep and intricate. It was a great scifi concept with plenty of creativity.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. This movie is very challenging to follow. To give you an idea so you can judge for yourself - We're both college grads with post graduate courses. If you look back at my previous movie reviews you'll see that when others find a movie hard to follow, I usually have no problem with it. Yet with this movie I think I'd have to watch it several times to really comprehend all of what was going on. Both my wife and I were lost a lot. In the end, I think we figured out the overall story, but there were long periods of just feeling lost and confused. This was frustrating. I see that the featured reviewer on the Amazon page mentions that she and her 11 year old brother understood it, but I think they must be Mensa geniuses.<br /><br />2. The manipulative nature of what the main characters were trying to accomplish made it harder to root for DiCaprio and his team. (Kind of a SPOILER: They were to make a decent man dismantle the company that was his inheritance by planting ideas in his subconscious.) Though the client hiring them to do this said it was to prevent a monopoly, it didn't seem completely right. They were risking this guys life for their own profit.<br /><br />Final recommendation: I'm a huge sci-fi fan, and this is not one of my favorite sci-fi movies. However it's still worth seeing for the Pros up above, especially if you like sci-fi or special effects movies. I'd recommend seeing it on DVD so you can rewind and rewatch it to get the story straight.he story straight.

0060853980|5.0|This is a very fun look at the apocalypse from the viewpoint of not wanting the apocalypse. Very humorous, much like much of Terry Pratchett's writing. I have not read a lot of Neil Gaiman, so I can't really compare it to his books. But take Terry Pratchett, make him a little less silly, and that closely matches the writing style of this book. Overall a very fun read, which I would recommend to anyone who is not easily offended by religious satire.
B002LHZV5E|5.0|Click is a film a lot of Adam Sandler fans are divided on but this movie was close to perfect Ilove this movie. Click was directed by Frank Coraci who directed the Waterboy & The Wedding Singer so he knows how to use Sandler right unlike a lot of other Sandler movies. It stars Adam Sandler as Michael Newman Kate Beckinsale as Donna Newman Christoper Walken as Morty & David Hasselhoff as Mr.Ammer. Plot is Michael Newman is a workaholic who just can't seem to fit anytime in for his Wife & kids. His Wife Donna doesn't like the fact that he can't keep his promises to the kids. Later he goes to a Bed Bath & Beyond he finds a room called Beyond this guy named Morty gives him a remote that controls his universe. The remote ends up taking control & fast forwards through his kids growing up his marriage falls apart & Donna's with this other guy. It even skips his Dad's death he never learned the quarter trick that he wanted to know since he was a kid it's a heartbreaking scene. I'm not spoiling it for you Click is a movie that earned my laughs & it leaves you with a good feeling at the end. I like how it didn't say it was totally a dream leaving it open. You should buy this It's $5 at Wal Mart or catch it when it's on TV.

B003ELOQD4|1.0|... but with everything that's plagued these guys (even though they're still touring right now) in the last year, it just might be. That would be sad, if so.<br /><br />The problems with this release:<br /><br />I've been a U2 fan for a very long time. Bono already thanked me directly during the Slane tour for giving them $500 during the span of their career. I've probably given more, and I hate to have to qualify myself before I write this review, as I hope people read it with a clear mind, but it's true.<br /><br />I think the more time passes, the more people expect from U2 and very likely the more U2 expect from themselves as well as a band. Most people when they tune into watching or listening to U2 want them to remain timeless, not age, play the same stuff perfectly and sound magnificent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this just isn't reality. Part of the problem is that U2 hasn't figured this out yet, either. Maybe it's the competitiveness of hearing the huge sums that the Rolling Stones pull in from their touring that keeps them coming back. I don't know. Honestly. But these last two DVD concerts, while they do look and sound better on some levels have really shown the truth about U2. I can't really knock U2 either because these guys have been on tour for the bulk of the last thirty years and that's no lie.<br /><br />But sadly, Bono is really aging badly and very quickly. I hate to say it, but it must be said. Sure everyone ages, but it doesn't look like the guy is in a great shape anymore. He's heavily winded during most of the concert, out of breath many times, doesn't have the vocal range of even 2001-2004 and the 'gimmicks' he used to employ to get him going during concerts like doing laps around the huge circle just don't get it. The long political dialogues front-ending songs, which must be brutal for the Edge and the boys, which also used to give Bono a short rest from singing during the concert, also don't really have the same heart in them. These monologues now lack sincerity and just come across as real over-rehearsed bloviation. I wish it was different, but from where I'm sitting, it isn't.<br /><br />1. This DVD is 1080i not 1080p. Packaging it as Blu-Ray is badly misleading and shameful. I've been hoping for a Blu-Ray release for sometime, but not like this.<br /><br />2. The editing of this is pretty uninspired and the shots they used as transitions were just awful.<br /><br />3. I watched this live on Youtube, for those that might remember that it was also streamed live that night, and this just doesn't feel or sound like the same concert.<br /><br />4. Bono's 'soapboxing' is probably at its worst here. I almost feel like someone is purposefully trying to repackage all this music to fit in as the soundtrack of the day and not the soundtrack of our lives as it has been. I almost feel like I'm being robbed. Placing this music into new contexts with speeches about current Government misdoings just makes a listener sad. The whole An San Suu Kyi piece should've been moving, but it wasn't. Even at home, alone, it was just uncomfortable.<br /><br />5. On the DVD, I really couldn't pin down any really inspirational performances here. Larry, Adam and the Edge were all on the money, but I think the front man really let them down. There was no 'All I want is you/Where the Streets' moment like on Slane.<br /><br />6. Making Breathe a bonus track instead of the opening is just plain wrong.<br /><br />7. The opening menu wasn't as seamless and intuitive as previous versions and several times while bouncing around from song to song the thing reset itself and started over. The opening menu was so convoluted that it's more of a hindrance than anything artful or cool.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this DVD for quite some time but it just didn't win me over. I usually play along with these U2 concert DVD's the best I can, but I couldn't find the heart in this show. If you catch the facial expressions of Larry andThe Edge, several times they seem not just frustrated but a bit mad. I might be too.<br /><br />I think the real lesson here is basic. My suggestions for U2 and what they should do regarding concerts in the future or at least for awhile, is only opinion. Take all of this as you may. I'm only a fan and a consumer and not an authority. It seems wrong to suggest anything.<br /><br />1. U2 should tone down these huge spectacles and preform smaller venues or do a smaller circuit. David Bowie did this and was incredibly successful at it. During his Heathen Tour he strictly played the 5 Burroughs in NY and played the clubs. People talked about seeing Bowie like this as his finest hour. U2 should to do this for awhile as all of their performances in smaller settings are typically phenomenal and very moving. Even their SNL, David Letterman, Jules Holland, et al, shows on Youtube are mind blowing. It's difficult to deny this.<br /><br />2. They should focus on releasing more intimate and personal DVD's  that really capture the essence of the band. The Documentary on \\"The Unforgettable Fire' that's on Slane is incredible. Sting, yes, Sting ... has released several DVD's where he filmed a few concerts at his house and they're very good. Even if you don't like Sting, The Police or that kind of music, it's hard to knock it and his level of honesty during filming is quite shocking. Sting's last DVD at Durham Cathedral was remarkable. The second disk was a camera following him around in his home town and was very moving. U2 should put something like that together. I don't know who wouldn't be enthralled.<br /><br />3. An acoustic package like the second disc from the HTDAAB release is long overdue. Hearing these songs in their most raw and broken down form greatly eclipse these uninspired performances from this show or the last one from Chicago.<br /><br />Look, I've posted a lot of U2 reviews through the years, some critical, some praising. I don't mean to say anything negative about Bono either. If you read this, Bono, please don't think I'm an ungrateful upstart. Not many people can do what you do or what you've done, so I won't pretend to think it's easy for a moment. We are all going to get older and begin to crumble. Some of us work at keeping it together harder than others. I don't know how hard you have to work or what more you have to do and I know you probably work a lot harder than I do. Whatever road you guys are going down, I hope it's the right one and not a direction that keeps putting out stuff like this. Some of us will probably turn away.<br /><br />In truth, I'm not going to say I'm not going to buy anymore U2 DVD's, because I will. I buy guitar equipment because of you guys and microphones, too. I buy books about U2 (and Bono) and I read them. I've seen you in concert and probably will again if I get the chance and can afford the tickets. I still buy U2 T-shirts and other stuff and probably always will. U2 has some of the most dedicated fans out there and I'm one of them. People love you for the music and the inspiration.

B003M5AXN4|4.0|As a story, Speed Racer is merely ok, too long and needlessly complex. But as a feast for the retinae and the parts of the brain that get off on intense color and movement, SR is in a league by itself.<br /><br />This is easily the most colorful film I have ever seen on our LCD screen; intense color saturation and wild CGI effects combine to just blow the mind. And the blu-ray transfer is eye-popping. I would recommend watching this just for eye candy purposes, and adandon ye all hope of basic plot etc, those who enter.<br /><br />Goodman and Sarandon are amusing, and there are some pretty sharp lines of social critique that pop up now and again; the Wachowskis hit some doubles and an occasional triple here in the dialogue and story departments. But the ball only leaves the park visually, never emotionally. Still, some of those action and color scenes are true home runs, looking like Miro got in a fight with Pollock and Calder and everyone lost their minds in the process.<br /><br />Don't watch this because you want a good movie, per se; watch it because you want your brain to turn off and your eyes to turn on, fully on. And do watch the blu-ray, which also has some fine extras along with one of the very best transfers to date.

B003L20ICE|5.0|Lisa Cholodenko's \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is, simply, one of 2010s best movies. It's a wise film about the family in our society. The acting is pitch perfect from Annette Bening (in her second grand slam performance this year, after \\"Mother and Child\\"), Julianne Moore (always incredible) and Mark Ruffalo (in a surprisingly honest performance). It's also the kids who add serious credibility, with the insanely perfect Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska (making up for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" in spades, isn't it amazing what a little character motivation can do for an actress?). The films emotional arc always rings true and the final moments of the film are layered, emotional, and moving in so many unexpected ways. The film is fun on top of all the great drama and works best as a snap shot of our time. This is one movie that will be remembered come Oscar season.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I got this DVD after really enjoying Jillian's Yoga Meltdown DVD and enjoy this work out as well.      I am a big aerobics person and am in fairly good condition.  I could do level one and two with ease, but level three held a bit of a challenge.  I still do workouts one and two but make my own modification to make them more difficult.      My one complaint about the DVD is it has a lot of video that the DVD does NOT let you skip.  It starts to get very frustrating after a few times.      Other than that it's a great addition to my exercise collection.

B003X73QA8|5.0|Arcade Fire's latest is less sing-along anthems and more straight-ahead, often retro, rock and roll.  Some of these songs sound like they could have been radio hits back in the days when you could still hear rock music on the radio.  \\"Modern Man\\" could almost be Matthew Sweet, the bluesy \\"Wasted Hours\\" could be a Replacements outtake, and in the fabulous \\"Sprawl II\\", Regine is channeling Heart of Glass-era Blondie.    And yet somehow, the album does not come off as derivative.  While it may be more intimate and less orchestral than Funeral or Neon Bible, the epic, heart-on-sleeve emotion that is Arcade Fire's hallmark is still there.  All the conflicting emotions of growing up in the suburbs are given their due - from ambivalence to nostalgia, from the longing for escape to the comforts of the familiar.    Upon repeated listens I find some of the mellower songs to be the ones that grow on me the most.  \\"Half Light I\\" has some of the most beautiful instrumentation I've heard on any Arcade Fire song, and \\"Deep Blue\\"'s use of spare piano and almost whispered vocals packs an emotional punch.  \\"Modern Man\\" is simply one of the best radio-friendly pop songs I've heard in ages.    I'd say if you loved Funeral and Neon Bible, you will love The Suburbs as well.   However, even if you were one of the few who didn't like the 2 earlier albums, The Suburbs might just change your mind.  Arcade Fire has managed to pull off the difficult feat of progressing while still remaining true to themselves.  This is a fantastic CD that currently ranks as the best of 2010.

The first game we played, our 8 year old won!  Dh and I were shocked.    This is a great game with very simple rules, but uses lots of strategy and spatial reasoning.  I recommend it for families with young children as well as those with older children.  After ds went to bed, dh and I played it with both of us playing 2 colors.  It was just as much fun!  We're not great at it yet (we still have several pieces leftover and no place to play them) but I think this could be our new go to family game.

B001FB55HQ|3.0|The Terminator films have always demanded that its viewers exhibit an above-average \\"disbelief suspension.\\"  Each incarnation of the series up to now has embraced the possibility of time travel with the caveat that only live matter or matter encased in live matter can make the journey (not to mention \\"dead\\" hair and fingernails attached to live matter).  And, of course, there's the liquid metal introduced in T2 and carried over into T3.  Although there's no time travel in \\"Terminator Salvation,\\" an above-average suspension of disbelief is still required.<br /><br />In this outing, John Connor is not \\"THE\\" resistance leader, but merely \\"A\\" resistance leader, one who is not even privy to what those at the top of the human food chain are doing or planning.  While on an ill-fated mission at the beginning, he discovers that the machines are kidnapping humans and, later, learns that they are being taken to Skynet HQ in San Francisco.  One of the kidnapped humans, he finds, happens to be Kyle Reese, his father (originally played by Michael Biehn in \\"The Terminator\\") who is only a teenager in this particular future.  He learns about Kyle from a character named Marcus Wright, played by Sam Worthington, who you'll immediately question the \\"humanness\\" of, which was probably intentional on the part of the filmmakers.<br /><br />While the plot of the film is--along with the acting and special effects--worthy enough to make this an above-average sci-fi movie, there are a few details that prompt some head scratching.  In many parts of the movie, gigantic terminators (land-based or airborne) are shown.  With such \\"beings\\" about, it's a little surprising that any shed in the desert hasn't been pulverized along with just about every other building that could shelter a human.  Add to that the fact that John Connor operates a fairly large resistance base replete with helicopters and fighter jets, all unbeknownst to the high-tech eyes of the machines.<br /><br />Whether or not you dwell on this type of thing (or notice it to begin with), \\"Terminator Salvation\\"  will probably fit your bill for high-budget, sci-fi action-adventure.  Recommended.(or notice it to begin with), \\"Terminator Salvation\\"  will probably fit your bill for high-budget, sci-fi action-adventure.  Recommended.
B002B55XGI|3.0|This book is really a conundrum.  Firstly, it is rare to get an insider view of the Special Forces, and secondly getting a first hand account of a battle in Afghanistan.  In that respect this book is very interesting and a captivating read.  However, the writing is very poor. And there are many cliches that leaves the reader a bit unsettled. Firstly, the frequent attempt to label the difficulties of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan as a failure of \\"liberals\\".  Now I can understand the frustration with the media, and I do also understand the arrogance and double standard that many politicians have, however to make blanket assumptions about \\"liberals\\" comes across as a bit half baked and a bit arrogant. Case in point the fact that he tries to defend the Abu Grahab fiasco.  There are many times as well that he uses his religious beliefs and even says \\"I don't know about Mahamed, and their god\\". Really, Islam and Christianity have many similarities and believe in many of the same things, but it is the leaders and cultural impositions that taint all religions.  The writing is often very sophomoric and comes across as shallow.  Having said that though, there are very many compelling aspects to this account that should awaken politicians and military strategists.  And there are many double standards and the American need to play by rules, when in war there are no rules, and we can't fight sanitized wars of total commitment without getting our hands dirty.  I agree with this, but the difference is that the author points to liberals as the reason our wars did not turn out the way they should have. But as a military planner and soldier he is forgetting the failure of his upper command structure, specifically Donald Rumsfeld and the Commander and Chief.  To wage war you must commit to the strategy of \\"mass at the point of decision\\" and hit the enemy with everything you have.  And then to wage war and control territory you must have an overwhelming presence.  That was the US's failure, to not send in enough troops to Iraq or to Afghanistan, and one of the grossest errors in military command is the failure to secure the ammunition dumps and have an overwhelming presence on the streets in Iraq and Afghanistan. The failure to dis-arm the populace and declare martial law until security was achieved.  These things are never really touched upon, and while I loath being labeled either a liberal or a conservative, his knee jerk reaction to label all the failures in waging these two wars as typical \\"liberal\\" idiocy does not serve his book well.   For example there are times when he points to the inability to kill the three who stumble upon their position as a \\"liberal\\" failure that constrains the military.  This is quite a stretch.   And I believe it is more a reflection on those soldiers humanity that gives them the moral superiority over their enemies.  And thankfully when he moves to the sympathetic village this starts to come out.  All in all I would recommend reading this with a critical eye, and a high tolerance for simplistic and cliche ridden prose.

B0036TGSRG|4.0|Actually, the first time I saw this film I did not think much of it, and by the end, I said to myself; is that all!!?? Well, I must not have been paying attention, or in a bad mood or something, because the second time I saw it, WOW! This is an incredible work of cinema.<br /><br />The film has an eerie sense of foreboding in nearly every frame.<br />Lang's home looks like a bunker, and the grounds are lifeless and bleak.<br />When we meet the major players, there is a tension in the air that we can't quite put our finger on.<br /><br />This tension builds slowly in layers with Polanski using the actors, their dialog, the buildings, the sets, the pacing, the gloomy atmosphere etc. to create a feeling that something is not quite right.<br />The memoires themselves seem to have a life of their own, they are a character in the narative.<br /><br />Polanski said this movie is for adults, he is not kidding.<br />It's clear that he did not have the American under 25 age group in mind.<br />There are no explosions, car chases, gun battles, fast close-up cutting, jitter-cam or any of the modern Hollywood gimmicks used as cues to elicit tension and manipulate audience reactions.<br />Polanski uses slow and deliberate pacing as he layers the narrative. Pay particularly close attention to Pierce Brosnan's performance in the beginning of the film, his demeanor, body language and dialog.<br /><br />A foreboding atmosphere permeates the entire film.<br />As an added touch, the ghost writer is never named, and the dialog cleverly tip-toes around it, even to the point of throwing in a little wry humor; \\"and who are you\\"? Lang asks, \\"I am your ghost\\"!<br />Lang refers to his ghost writer as \\"man\\", \\"he always says that when he can't remember someone's name\\".<br /><br />There is a stark realism to this film, everything is logical and all the story pieces fit together in a way that could actually happen.<br />This is not a \\"larger than life\\" farfetched action thriller yarn.<br /><br />The film is loaded with subtle clues and nuances' in the acting, and the final 30 minutes is sheer cinematic gold. Reminisant of Hitchcock at his best. The scene where the note is passed from person to person until it is finally read by Mrs. Lang is wonderful. This is the work of a master filmmaker.<br /><br />Don't be too put off if you don't like it the first time, it's the kind of film that you really need to pay attention to everything. The second time around it will make perfect sense.<br />Polanski dots every \\"I' and crosses every \\"t\\", the film seems uncomfortably real leaving no gaps of logic.<br />The ending is ironic genius.<br /><br />At the end, I felt as though this could actually happen, and the implications are staggering.minutes is sheer cinematic gold.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|Science fiction film set in the year 2154 about a paraplegic soldier called Jake Sully who is part of the army of a company from Earth called the RDA corporation and who goes with the corporation and its army to an alien world called Pandora in a distant planetary system. Pandora has large deposits of a mineral called unobtanium which has much market value and which will mean much profits for the RDA corporation if the deposits can be mined. But there is a problem: the deposits of this mineral are sitting underneath the home of a tribe of the savage and pre-technological indigenous aliens of this world (the Na'vi) and if these deposits are to be mined the tribe's home - a large tree the size of a small mountain that seems to be a person - will have to be destroyed. Man has mastered technology that allows a human being to transport his consciousness into another body, and a number of Na'vi versions of these bodies have been cloned. Sully is called to have his consciousness transported into one of these bodies, to become what is called an `avatar' (Hindu for a god in human form). The corporation's hope is that as an avatar Sully will be accepted into the society of the Na'vi tribe they want to move from their home (the Na'vi are generally suspicious of man (whom they refer to as `the sky people')) and as the tribe come to trust him Sully will be able to persuade the tribe to move out of their home peacefully and relocate. However if this strategy fails, the corporation is prepared to use military force to force the Na'vi tribe out of their tree home. But as Sully spends time as an avatar with the tribe of Na'vi and gets to know them and their world, he comes to understand that they will never leave their tree home because they are spiritually tied to it. But this inevitably means that they will be forced out of their home by the RDA corporation, and having fallen in love with the Na'vi people and their world Sully begins to see the objectives of the RDA corporation as unjust and changes allegiances when the RDA corporation starts moving to force the tribe of Na'vi out of their home using military force because the avatar strategy has failed. But Sully is not alone: a small number of other men from the RDA corporation (who have also had crises of conscience about what the RDA corporation wants to do) join him to fight alongside the tribe of Na'vi to defend their tree home against the RDA corporation and its army. And so with the stakes the removal of a tribe of an alien people from their home by human military force for corporate ends the battle is joined.<br /><br />Comments: I was pleased to see men acting on their conscience in this film against corporate evil. I was also pleased to see that in this film the Na'vi aliens live in harmony with their world Pandora and take care of it (i.e. do not destroy it), unlike us men who largely destroy our earth. I loved the beauty of Pandora - its fauna, flora and geography - and Pandora was actually more beautiful than the earth. But I was not pleased that the film's makers chose to give the Na'vi aliens sub-Saharan Negro African accents, to drive home the fact that they were savages. This was somewhat racist; in fact one of the human characters in the film at one point with contempt refers to the Na'vi as `blue monkeys' (the Na'vi are blue-skinned), an obvious insult. Also the name of the mineral that causes all the trouble in the film (unobtanium) is silly and a little obvious. Apart from these quibbles it was a very good film with a stunning climax. I especially loved Pandora's native Toruk dragons and the bond that they formed with their riders, including our hero Sully. But the title of the film `Avatar' and the use of this word in the film is incorrect because it implies that the central human character in the film Sully was viewed by the tribe of Na'vi aliens as a god because he came `from the sky' and had changed his form from human to Na'vi when in fact the Na'vi viewed men withhostility and suspicion (which is why Sully becomes an avatar in the first place). Nonetheless an excellent film which comes highly recommended.ity and suspicion (which is why Sully becomes an avatar in the first place). Nonetheless an excellent film which comes highly recommended.

Krakauer gives McCandless new life on the page all the while paying tribute to wanderlust: the incurable ailment that has doubtless claimed thousands of lives over the millennia.    Many continue to hold Chris McCandless in contempt for his apparent foolishness and the supposed meaninglessness of his death. In fact, Krakauer and his formidable writing ability have given McCandless and his story meaning and significance that a select few of us could ever hope to achieve.
B000002MP2|5.0|I just reviewed Dookie as my second video review on YouTube. I think it an amazing record, as well as being one of the most iconic albums ever. Even though tracks like \\"She\\" \\"Longview\\" and \\"F.O.D.\\" are standouts, the entire album is great all the way through. But if you are a more casual Green Day fan, just buy International Superhits instead. It contains the big singles from all the 90s Green Day albums.    For my full review, go to YouTube and search \\"Green Day Dookie Experience\\" or just add \\"Youtube\\" to find it on Google.

B002ZG97RE|3.0|My husband and I LOVE Matt Damon movies, but this one was a disappointment and not at all the action packed thriller we expected.
0061714372|4.0|Originally posted here:  [...].    I've never considered myself a huge fan of Megadeth. Their earlier albums always seemed to be very inconsistent in terms of quality, and their mid-era commercial attempts were mostly terrible. There are exceptions of course, Rust in Peace is easily one of the best thrash albums of all time and Endgame is just about equal (and sometimes better, depending on my mood) - but this isn't about me and isn't really about Megadeth either. This is about Dave Mustaine; the man that has had the great fortune of being part of two of the biggest metal bands of the last thirty years. He's also the man that everyone has loved to hate due to his tendency to speak his mind and treat fellow band mates as if they were totally expendable (in hindsight one could argue that they really have been). If anyone in the metal community has lived a life that is worthy of having a book written about him, it is Dave Mustaine. The man has dealt with drug use, the stigma of being dropped from Metallica, the total rise to prominence in Megadeth, accidents, multiple member changes and a slew of other things that the average person would never even know about - that is until now.    Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir is a very entertaining trip through Dave Mustaine's turbulent life beginning with his childhood and ending shortly before the release of their latest album Endgame. The book is very well-written in the sarcastic, crass - yet generally intelligent - style that Dave Mustaine is known for. He rarely holds anything back and tells things exactly the way he sees them; which will often elicit a chuckle due to the dry humor that he injects into every facet of his life. He also seems to be keenly aware of his target audience because he never strays too far from the musical aspects of his life. To that end, one need not worry about being subjected to an overly-long therapy session about how Dave Mustaine wasn't hugged enough as a child. In fact, the brief portions about his childhood are basically just used to present the few experiences that stuck with Dave throughout his life before quickly moving into his teen years and the beginning of his musical and spiritual journey.    I make sure to include \\"spiritual\\" because every fan should know by now that it took Dave Mustaine finding god in order to finally kick the multitude of addictions that he has carried with him throughout his life. Due to this, God and religion come up fairly often over the course of the book - from his complete opposition to religion in the beginning to his eventual \\"awakening\\" later in life. What he never does, though, is use his book as a pulpit to preach of God or religion; an element that could have turned a lot of his fans off if it had been overdone. In fact, he doesn't try to push any morals on his readers at all. When he speaks of his drug use or his other indiscretions, he includes the bad with the good and leaves it to the reader to make a final judgment. He will occasionally use hindsight to reflect on his past, but the judgments he makes are his own and he never tries to apply them in any kind of broad manner.     For those that are interested in the man behind the music, this book will not disappoint. It presents, along with all of the gory details, Dave's time with Metallica, the various member changes within Megadeth, his drug use, family problems, religious struggles, label struggles as well as random amusing stories that simply demonstrate the crazy life that he has lead. There are great stories involving his days dealing drugs after being kicked from his mom's house, and his few attempts to get \\"real\\" jobs that never really panned out. Of course, his time with Metallica is meticulously detailed, and there is actually quite a good build-up to his eventual dismissal. It's also quite cool to learn about where the band name came from and how certain songs/events came to pass. Most interesting, though, is the fact that Dave Mustaine never misses an opportunity to specifically mention those people that have helped him throughout his life including Danny Lilker (ex-Anthrax).    There are actually only a few minor complaints that I have with this book. In the beginning, the circumstances surrounding every album are presented in quite a bit of detail but by the time of Youthanasia things start to be condensed considerably. By the time we get to The System has Failed it almost feels like more of a footnote than any kind of actual album history. Granted, by that point the debauchery had pretty much faded and this is a book about Dave Mustaine the man not Dave Mustaine's band, but it still felt a bit lacking. To that same end, I also wish that he would have maybe given a bit of additional information about what happened to his various band mates after being removed  - but, again, it is a book about Dave Mustaine not the various footnotes in his life. The only other issue I had was with a few omissions involving Chris Poland. Chris Poland was a big part of Dave's early life and had more influence over him than most might be aware of, but he isn't even mentioned during the Rust in Peace sessions, and barely mentioned during The World Needs a Hero era. I would have been interested to read about how it was Chris came back for those two albums and why it was he eventually left again.     Overall, Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir is everything that I hoped it could be. It details all of the major events of Dave Mustaine's life without holding back the gory details. When something is Dave's fault he owns up to it and when it's someone else's fault he doesn't hesitate to point it out. Even for those that don't really care to read about Dave Mustaine's life, quite a bit of the book is actually devoted to the events surrounding the creation of Megadeth's first six albums. I'm willing to bet that more than a few fans would be interested to read about the thought process behind Risk[ or the whirlwind of events surrounding theband's original line-up. Basically, Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir has something for even the most apathetic of Megadeth fans and is written in a very entertaining manner thanks to the dry humor and no-holds-barred attitude of Dave Mustaine.
B003L20ICE|5.0|This film is excellent and is highly recommended. It has some subtle messages around the concepts of family and affinity, loyalty and self-gratification, growth and pain. Sometimes these concepts are not easily explored in a motion picture because they impact us all at some point in our lives and they may seem like the ordinary challenges of life with others.  However, this film brings these issues to life with excellent actors and intelligent scripting and a somewhat unique context. By now everyone knows the story narrative around two middle-aged lesbians who have reared a daughter and son (now 18 and 15) and have an established family unit.  But for many lesbians that used a sperm donor bank, the curiosity of their children about the identity of their father is a expected and normal occurrence that may test their confidence as parents. In this story, the parents Nic (played by Annette Bening) and Jules (played by Julianna Moore) adjust to the idea of their children seeking out their natural father. Mark Ruffalo plays the role of Paul, their natural father, who provides an outstanding performance. Paul is a single man with a long string of girlfriends, current and past, who has never settled down to have a family of his own and really has not contemplated the impact a family might have upon his growth and personal well-being. He is contacted and in a casual way he increases his interactions with his children. He gradually falls in love with his own children and then gradually falls in love with the family in which they live. The mistake comes when he makes the error of sexualizing this personal contact with one of the two mothers in the family. I have said enough here since I don't want to spoil this excellent film for anyone.     However, the film fully explores that building a family is not an easy task and it requires the utmost honesty, transparency, care, patience, understanding, and trust. Nic and Jules have worked for many years to build their family. Babiesare born overnight but a family is built one day at a time, with many trials and tribulations, many of which are painful.     Ruffalo, as Mark, demonstrates that a family, especially composed of one's own biological children is incredibly seductive for a man who never expected a family. His primary mistake is one of boundaries. He may find himself falling in love with his children, that is only natural, but he needed to respect the family boundary that Nic and Jules have painstakingly constructed with their children over the years. He really only has two choices. He can accept the boundaries of their family and support them as a family unit and/or he can go start a family of his own. He makes some painful mistakes in the film and is really left with few options.     The film is about the integrity of the family unit, its fragility and strength, and its ability to forgive and repair. No wonder Mark is so attracted to it. You will be attracted to it too.
B000EQ47GS|4.0|This debut album in 1976 came at a time when punk rock was taking off in the UK, so this was a very welcome repost and provided some of the best classic rock ever made.  More Than A Feeling and Peace Of Mind are fantastic for starters, Foreplay/Long Time follows, then another highlight, Rock & Roll Band.  Smonkin' is not as good, but Hitch A Ride is another out of the top drawer.  Finally Something About You and Let Me Take take You Home Tonight are a little less precise rock than my preferred songs.  Having said all that, easily 4 stars and the follow up, Don't Look Back, carried on in the same vein and possibly out performed this one.

I watched the Pacific HBO series which led me to purchase the book and am very glad I did. Like always the book is far better then the very well done series. I highly recommend this book if you have any interest in any war scenarios but especially the Pacific theater during WW II. This book very much makes you think how petty your daily problems may appear compared to what these extremely brave men have been through. Since it is a memoir the reality is much more clear. Buy this book you will not be disappointed.
B0007KS7D0|5.0|I'm not a professional photographer by any stretch of the imagination, but I've always loved doing macro shots.  I've tried other similarly priced diopter lenses and without a doubt the quality of this lens is fantastic, especially given the price.  I actually gave away my other macros lenses after I bought this one.    I shoot with the Panasonic 45-200 on a G1 and this lens gives you around a 100mm to 18mm FoV (depending on zoom) and down to a 1mm DoF (depending on f stop).  Expect to be about 30cm from what you're shooting.  No CA or distortion visible to the casual observer (i.e. me).  Check out the manufacturer's website for example shots.  The adapter ring is solid and easy to use.    For other G1 owners, the manufacturer mentions some vignetting on the kit lens (the 14-45).  It's actually pretty bad and limits the useful range of that lens to around 25-30 with the macro on, but it still might be worth it.

I recieved this movie on VHS Tape for christmas about 31 years ago..It is the only film we have  of Elvis that let's those of us that where never lucky Enough to see him in person feel the experience...     I signed a on-line pettition about 2years ago to finally get this historic film on DVD.You would think  they would do it right,and add in the parts cut from the film in an extras menu.But NOOOO.These where unavailable  on the video tape release,But show the human and personal side of this awesome entertainer..Elvis signs a poster  for a young girl that has a life threatening condition.     The thing that really ticks me off about this DVD is \\"They changed the opening title Music!!!\\"  What the hell where they thinking! The song on the original was Johnny B. Goode witch matched Elvis'  movements on the film,This other song is so out of place on this DVD it almost makes you not even bother  watching the film..SUCH A DISSAPOINTMENT!!!They really did a number on this,and just slapped it together....
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Thanks for not dumbing this down, DC.  The storyline closely followed the Red Hood story (stories) from the comics, and the many character appearances were a welcome surprise.  We were treated to many characters within the Batman mythos without having to go through any origin stories (e.g., Nightwing, Ra's al Ghul, Black Mask, Joker).  The only origin story that was presented (Robin II/Jason Todd/Red Hood) was integral to the storyline and shown in flashbacks.  There was also a reference to \\"friends\\" that were shot (i.e., Batgirl/Barbara Gordon) by the Joker.  I'm glad that DC has gotten over the hump of feeling like they have to introduce characters in their animated films lately.  Instead, they place these characters into intelligent films and focus on the stories themselves, relying mostly on fans' knowledge bases.  After all, who is buying these DVDs?  Probably not anyone who's never picked up a comic book before.<br /><br />The Jonah Hex short was entertaining as well.  I've never been a big fan of his (or Westerns in general), but I enjoyed watching this particular well-told story.<br /><br />Next up?  How about using the comedic Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing again in a New Teen Titans animated film.  (\\"The Judas Contract,\\" anyone?  Or actually ANY of the early stories from Marv Wolfman and George Perez.)  Or perhaps a tale including the events from \\"A Killing Joke\\" and Barbara Gordon's transformation into Oracle and the forming of the superheroine group Birds of Prey?

030726999X|5.0|I (and virtually everyone else in my book club) was totally enthralled with this trilogy by the late Swedish author, Stieg Larsson.  The story builds throughout the three books and ends (in my opinion) quite satisfactorily.  Along with a GREAT story with a unique protagonist, there is much in it to give one thought about the role of women in modern society, the acceptance of the \\"unusual\\" or \\"different\\" in society, and the sometimes good, sometimes not so good, machinations of governments.  Highly recommended...

When I inquired about returning the item, they were very prompt in getting back to me.  However, they would not send me the item that I ordered as an exchange because now the item is $30 more than when we put the order in.  I told them that was not our fault - had they sent the one we ordered at the correct time, there wouldn't have been an issue.  Makes me wonder if it was known that the price was going to rise???  They did work with me towards the steps for a refund but I will be sure not to order from them in the future.  Again.....IT IS NOT OUR FAULT THAT THE PRICE CHANGED.  I didn't feel that they understood that.  Not very good customer service if you ask me!

B00009W8N2|5.0|Opeth is a great band, one of my all time favorites and they always will be, with that said I must say that I am a fan more of their earlier material than their newer music. Not that their new music is anything terrible, its just different, they have evolved, some say for the better and some say for worse, I say I like Opeth as a whole. They really are a band that grows with you and you literally have to listen to their albums and hear them evolve into what they are now to appreciate the music that they make these days. In the beginning they owned the scene creatively and took progressive metal into a new direction, they took a extreme form of music and made it that much more abstract and almost made it into a art form. Their career has seen them come full circle and now they have almost mastered their craft to a point where it seems like they have it down to a science, what was once over the top and musically insane in this world is now what we expect from Opeth, that is why I think I prefer their older material, it is because of the passion for doing something new and being a young band while doing it. It makes for a different experience when the band is still in itself creating a new genre in death metal. I mean normally when people think of progressive death metal they think of Cryptopsy(who also are worth being a part of any metallers album collection!) or something, and that was the normal thing to associate with the term progressive death metal until Opeth came around and did something completely different with that genre tag. This album is amazing from start to finish. It shows where their particular musical journey began. I honestly say purchase all of their albums, listen to them in order and see for yourself what I am talking about.

0307454541|2.0|Really, what is all the fuss about? Every bookshop I have been in for the last year has had this book featured in a prominent position. For a long time I resisted, but I had a long trip away from home coming up so I bought it to help fill the downtime. It was a bad mistake. Maybe you can suspend disbelief about a socially dysfunctional young woman who absented herself most of her schooldays and left without a qualification only to turn into a multi-lingual computer hacker with a photographic memory and friends in foreign lands who can gratuitously tap people's phones. But then you have to deal with six hundred pages of turgid prose that seem as long as a Swedish winter. Still thinking of giving it a try? Then let me mention the banal and plodding dialogue that eats away at your patience, the prose that's as heavy as a suffocating blanket of snow and all the humour of a Soviet Gulag. And, please, spare me the final hundred pages with the denouement and Blomqvist's vindication in his battle with the evil industrialist. This isn't even worthy of a boy's comic book. Good literature this is not. It's not even an entertaining read. In fact, it's just tedious.

This book is well-written and entertaining, but when I got near the end I wanted to fling it across the room.  The ending is a betrayal of the romantic comedy genre and of the pact with the reader.  I hope they change it for the film version starring Anne Hathaway.  The fastest way to kill a movie's box office is to botch the ending.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|For anyone remotely interested in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, this film is a must-see. \\"JFK\\" dramatizes the events that led up to Kennedy's death on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963 and the subsequent days and months that Americans will never forget. The story is told through the eyes of a former New Orleans district attorney, Jim Garrison, played beautifully by Kevin Costner, and his belief that Lee Harvey Oswald did not murder the President and his opinion that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy by the U.S. government and other individuals.<br /><br /> Oliver Stone directed and co-wrote \\"JFK\\" and based his work on two books that dealt with Kennedy's death. The movie went on to become one of the biggest films of the 1990's and was subsequently nominated for an amazing eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture, ultimately winning two for Best Editing and Cinematography. The film was also a financial giant grossing over $200,000,000 worldwide.<br /><br /> This excellent two-disc set comes with an impressive array of bonus features including 54 minutes of deleted scenes, audio commentary by Oliver Stone, and a documentary entitled \\"Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspriracy\\".
B000NOKA0S|5.0|Leonard Cohen had a somewhat unusual background for a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer (he was inducted the day I bought this album). He was from a Jewish family in pre-Quiet Revolution Montreal, and had been a published poet for over a decade before actually recording songs. The result is that his vocals were never trained and Cohen had a reputation as one of rock's first \\"non-singers\\".<br /><br />The effect of being in his thirties, however, was that Cohen was able to take a very different attitude towards the cultural changes that were taking place in the late 1960s - one which unlike Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell placed him well out of the mainstream and meant that only his first two albums ever dented the Top 100 on Billboard. (In Europe, where Cohen was viewed as a romantic, he had such a large following that he managed to chart on a regular basis into the 1990s). Whereas Dylan and Mitchell had a rock orientation in their focus on the steel-string guitar, Cohen generally used a nylon-string guitar and a spartan string orchestra to accompany his vocals. The results can only be described as surprising in their simple beauty, and even as catchy.<br /><br />The opener \\"Suzanne\\" (which I confused for a long time with a song by [[ASIN:B000063CNC the Hollies]] sets the tone with simple, almost classical poetry that has remarkable delicacy to it. Cohen's often-criticised voice was for me not a hard taste to acquire: indeed I found quite easily the reason it fits what he wrote so well. The following track \\"Master Song\\" is a mini-epic of the relationship between people that can be described as very conservative (did John J. Miller miss this one?) yet it is so tender that it can make one cry. \\"Winter Lady\\", \\"The Stranger Song\\" and \\"Sisters of Mercy\\" follow on this beauty, but on the second side of the original vinyl Cohen, if anything, take the same formula even further.<br /><br />\\"So Long, Marianne\\" is an epic in the same way as \\"Master Song\\" but its moving tale of love surpasses it for darkness as well as for emotion, and then \\"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\\" takes one into the slow depths of recognising failure in a way people during the late 1960s had little inclination to do. Cohen, no doubt, tells genuine truth about how many people of the Boom Generation failed to form long-lasting relationships, and the three remaining songs on the second side of \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\", if more upbeat, show just how wise Cohen seems with hindsight.<br /><br />All in all, among the male singer/songwriters of the late 1960s and early 1970s no statement more definitive than \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" exists. [[ASIN:B000002KHF Moondance]] would be its closest rival, but for all its nature-based mystical passion it is scarcely so wise or compassionate as Cohen's superb debut. The desolate, hushed, mystical beauty of \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" was unlike anything else around at the time, yet it stands up with age so well.ell as for emotion, and then \\"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\\" takes one into the slow depths of recognising failure in a way people during the late 1960s had little inclination to do.

Cindi Laupers range on this spin is absolutely incredible I've had it in my car player for two weeks and I'm not sure when it's coming back out.  I was afraid that with BB being part of the band that he would overshadow everything but I'm terribly happy to report that BB King played to Cindi and not above her. The band is also so sweet.  If your a fan of the Blues you'll love this Honest to God amazing CD. As a life long fan of Janis I was crushed when she passed.  Since then there have been only a dozen or so Female artists who have gotton my attention singing the Blues and only occasionally but none have put it all together like Cindi has with this effort. She had a lot to choose from and she chose well.

But I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend asked me to order this for him so we could watch it together. I realized quickly that Evangelion wasn't just about a giant robot (and actually, I don't think the Evangelion suits are robots...), it was a personal story about this boy who is put into an extraordinary situation and expected to \\"man up\\" and be a hero, when he feels like everything but a hero. This re-version of Evangelion is beautifully atmospheric and has texture to it. I can't wait to see the other parts to this series. If you are like I was, close-minded to Mecha, then this is a good anime to watch to get yourself acquainted to it...and maybe even enjoy it.

B002RVZV9K|3.0|and still not make a delicious cake.  I know I'm in trouble when I start looking at the time readout on the DVD, mentally calculating how much longer a film is.  That started for me about halfway into this project.  I knew about Page and Edge of course, had heard of Jack but knew little about him.  I now know he's a very odd, self-important duck, almost a parody of ... well of someone trying to play Jack White.  Page is somewhat reflective and plays some licks, Edge is either really self-effacing or has almost no personality - and it was frustrating to just keep hearing how much he loved effects, and how many effects he had, and how he could combine them, OK I get it.  But can you play?  That is never really answered in the film.    When the 3 of them come together on the soundstage, once again there's plenty of kindling but it never catches fire.  Just an old bloke, a middle aged bloke and a young 'un who has decided he's not going to be awed by the others and just act like he's their equal.  Odd song selections and really no playing to speak of.  All in all, this might have been an interesting 30 minute short but does not have the weight necessary to justify its length.  Rent don't buy, if you think you're interested.

B002QQ8HAG|4.0|Not just that, but I'm a guy.  I enjoyed Devil Wears Prada (OK, so shoot me) and was surprised to discover that this \\"real\\" look at Vogue is just less interesting.  I know all about Anna's reputation, but you never get a feel for her in this documentary.  Either she doesn't have much to say by nature, or isn't very self-analytical, or just isn't that interesting a person.  We basically learn she has a daughter who wants to be a lawyer.  When we see her in action at work, making decisions left and right involving people's careers and lives and fortunes in an arbitrary fashion, I just kept thinking well this is probably how just about every CEO in America operates.  When you've got the power, you don't need to justify your decisions - you either like it or you don't, and everyone else is there to carry out your mandates.  In fact Anna is so uninteresting after a while that the filmmakers ultimately end up making a film that's more about Grace Coddington, who we are supposed to admire for her backstory and her photo shoots.  But in her own way she's just as stubborn and opinionated as Anna, doesn't make her right or wrong, it just shows how arbitrary the fashion business is.  Again, probably like almost every other business.    Speaking now as a guy, I have to say I was surprised that the world of fashion mags isn't full of fantastic looking ingenues spending way too much of their income and time on appearances.  I've been to ad agencies where the staff looked and dressed better than these folks, and they're in the business!  And I never would have believed that a character like Andre Talley existed until I saw him - now THAT at least lived up to the hype of a Vogue lifestyle.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis describes behind the scenes happenings which led to the major global financial crisis  in 2008. Leading to freezing of credit markets and massive unemployment. How, unabashedly by gaming the system, and creating devious and confusing instruments, Wall street screwed the Main street. What has become common knowledge is that the main culprit was the subprime mortgage loans. Firstly, how a house of cards was built by lending money to people who never had the financial resources to repay them. Secondly, by packaging these loans into bonds whose ratings were gamed to be labelled as very safe (triple-A).Thirdly, by selling unregulated insurance against this house falling down. The details behind each of these headlines is narrated aptly in detail by Lewis, who once worked for Salomon Brothers, the creator of the mortgage backed bond.      In the beginning were the simple mortgages, which people used to buy homes to fulfil their American dreams.  In addition to the risk of a default, there was always some uncertainty about the cash flow to the lender, because the borrowers had the option to pre-pay the mortgages.  To reduce the uncertainty of cash flows, Wall street divided them into tranches. First tranch was like the first floor of a tall building. It got paid with the first wave of pre-payments. It attracted a higher interest rate to allow for the high possibility of pre-payments. Top tranche was like the top floor. They got lower rate but only the later pre-payments. The mortgage backed bond was supposed to spread the risk to different parties. How it ended up doing the opposite by concentrating the risk, takes us to the chapters on lax lending and creation of 2 more instruments of mass destruction.      Lax lending was enabled by Wall street to package the mortgages, regardless of their quality, into highly rated bonds. They did this by selecting mortgages of individuals with high FICO scores into packages. The average scores on the packages were highlighted, but the individual mortgages or the scores were never revealed. The rating agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor bought this story. It turns out that the FICO scores themselves can be gamed. Migrant workers with no borrwing history can have a high FICO score. Although called a thin file FICO score, it was never challenged in a package. Similarly, someone who borrows money and quickly repays back can get a high FICO score. The \\"average high FICO\\" score bond thus had a mix of mostly thin file, some thick file scores. It created breeding grounds for high default rates. Lot of subprime mortgage lending companies made customers to take second mortgages & reduce their credit card debt. With low teaser rates for the first two years,  as a carrot.      More obfuscation ensued with the creation of a deadly instrument called CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation). It is a second level mortgage backed bond, derived from parts of a primary mortgage bond, which itself is derived from pool of mortgages. Again, the rating agencies obliged Wall street with high ratings for junk CDOs. Thus the investors ended up paying up for what essentially was a toilet paper. Secondly, another insturment called CDS (Credit Default Swap) was created to offer insurance on CDOs and mortgage backed bonds. This insurance was obviously unregulated, as opposed to other forms of insurance like Auto insurance or Life insurance. There was no margin requirements for the sellers of CDS . AIG Financial Products became the biggest seller of CDS.    There were some smart people who foresaw the looming disaster. They wanted to short the bond market to make enormous gains. But, unfortunately there is no way to short a bond, like one can short an equity. But the smarter ones saw the CDS as a vehicle for shorting the bond, or a CDO for that matter. They bought CDS for bonds they did not hold. It is like placing a bet that the bond market will collapse. When the collapse did happen, the sellers of CDSs wereat the fag end of the bargain. AIG FP had to be bailed out with enormous amount of tax payer's money. Most of that money got funnelled to the Wall street giants Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank etc. Some firms who held onto the CDOs got hit in a big way, like Morgan Stanley, Merril Lynch, Citigroup etc. JP Morgan Chase bailed itself out in time to escape the fury of the storm.     Lewis makes three interesting points in the end.  Firstly, his ex-boss, John Gutfreund turned Salomon Brothers from a partnership into Wall Street's first public corporation in 1981. A consequence of turning Wall street partnerships into public corporations was to transfer the financial risk to the shareholders. Lewis mentions that this is a watershed event on Wall street. No investment bank owned by its employees would have leveraged itself 35:1, or bought [...] billion in CDOs, or gamed the rating agencies.      His second point is that it is no longer the social and economic relevance of a bank that renders it too big to fail, but the number of side bets that have been made on it. For example, Citigroup's failure would trigger the payoff of a massive bet of unknown dimensions: from people who had sold credit default swaps on Citigroup to those who had bought them.      Thirdly, he says that the bond market is not as much regulated as the equity market is. For example, there is no stricture against insider trading of bonds. In the land of equities, insider trading is not allowed. Mainly becasue, unlike the equity markets, the bond markets are dominated by a few Institutional investors. Becasue of which there is no political mileage to be obtained by regulating the bond market, since it is not supposed to effect the investor on the main street. As the subsequent events proved, the main street was in the direct path of a severity 5 storm, unleashed by the mortgage backed bonds.     IMF estimated that one trillion dollars was lost in the US subprime mortgages market. Since it is a zero sum game, as Michael Douglas says in the movie \\"Wall Street\\", it is not difficult to guess who made the one trillion dollars, at the expense of the main street.

So trying to be a well rounded reader, I  picked up her latest - The Search - on a hot lazy Sunday afternoon in the hammock. Perfect choice!<br /><br />Fiona Bristow was the lucky one. Destined to be the 13th victim of the Red Scarf Killer serial killer, she fought back, escaped and he was captured, prosecuted and jailed. Fiona's fiancee was also a victim. She has retreated to Orcas Island where she works as a  dog trainer and also leads a volunteer canine search and rescue group.  Simon, a talented wood artist, is also looking for peace and quiet when he moves to Orcas. But his puppy Jaws needs professional help and he seeks out Fee. Well, sparks fly.... But danger is afoot as well. Although the killer is safely behind bars, someone seems to be on a mission to duplicate his work. Is Fiona in his sights?<br /><br />Roberts has created a strong female lead in Fiona. Simon is the rough and ready, not looking for a relationship kind of guy (who of course just happens to be really attractive) The interactions between the two are entertaining if not wholly believable. I got a little tired of hearing Simon say shut up. There's some steamy sex scenes between the two that did a steamy day justice. For the most part, the story is more on their budding relationship with the killer taking a back seat. Yes the suspense is there, but those looking for a high level thriller won't find it here.<br /><br />As a dog lover, what I did really like were the dog training scenes. Lots of good information, some I've tried - I've got one who likes to jump up on people - and it worked! I found the search and rescue operations and methodology just as interesting. Some readers may find this slows them down. Great dog quote from the book \\"One of the best things about dogs, to Fiona's mind, was their absolute joy in welcoming you home, whether you'd been gone for five minutes or five days.

How she manages to make her voice part of the orchestration is beyond me - I'm not a singer - but she never tries to overpower the subtleties of the score. All the songs on this CD are beyond description in the way she handles them, and if you can get through the CD without that mandatory box of Kleenex, still knowing that the composer was a contented man, always in love with his Pauline, good for you! And the lullaby! Oh, help me off the floor somebody!<br /><br />We love you, Jessye...Have a look at her singing Isolde's farewell with von Karajan at the end of his life's journey on YouTube. She's utterly ethereal while staying on the earth. I thank the Universe for her presence.

This story had a stupid plot that even if you did like a little was totally ruined by the crappy, unrealistic ending. The main character, Ed, kept changing his personality through the book and being a stupid little whiner. The plot was so stupid! I hated it! I didn't even see how Ed was a messenger at all. I am so mad I got assigned this for my summer book and will have to discuss it for the first week of school. All that crap about feeling the hearts and then there were stalkers videotaping Ed and knowing exactly what he would do and breaking into his apartment! Do not read it if you like books to make sense!

The same is true for judges who, in the words of our former Lord Chief Justice, Harry Woolf, believe judging is much more than merely deciding cases! Yes, this is one of the few entertaining books which can be classified as a work on judicial reasoning and how a judge might decide from the insider perspective.<br /><br />So, every judge should be encouraged to read it, continues Lord Woolf, adding `I am sure it would improve their understanding of what the job really involves and what justice is about.<br /><br />Sachs is a doughty and courageous fighter in the struggle for justice in South Africa under the malevolent apartheid regime which made that country a world pariah.  Following the release of Nelson Mandela in 1994 - who can forget that day - Sachs played an important role in drafting South Africa's post-apartheid Constitution and was appointed by Mandela as a member of its first constitutional court.<br /><br />With the startling lucidity which characterizes his writing, Sachs reveals what it was like to be a judge in circumstances which are particularly unique, especially in view of the fact that he was himself a victim of apartheid.<br /><br />As an advocate at the Cape Bar from the age of 21, he defended people charged under racist statures and repressive security laws, incurring the wrath of the authorities.  He was subjected to banning orders, placed in solitary confinement for two spells of detention and exiled in 1966.  After working for some 20 years in the UK and Mozambique, he was seriously injured by a bomb.<br /><br />Now as his term on the Constitutional Court nears its end, Sachs looks back on his extraordinary life, writing with passion and insight about the ways in which his experiences have influenced his judicial approach and his views on the nature of justice.<br /><br />When one has suffered oneself under an irrational and oppressive regime, including detention and torture, one's personal and judicial outlook will inevitably be influenced accordingly.<br /><br />`It was the worst moment of my life,' recalls Sachs, describing a particularly appalling incident of torture. `It was not a hypothetical situation of the kind that some academics conjure up when discussing the costs and benefits of the government using torture,' he comments,  `the practice was systematic, it was organized, it was condoned, it was part of policy.'<br /><br />Policy makers worldwide, even in the enlightened democracies, who have been tempted to believe that there are pros as well as cons which justify torture in whatever form, should read this powerful and enlightening book.<br /><br />And `how do life experiences affect legal decision making?' asks Sachs in the preface.  `The answer,' he concludes, `is in unexpected ways.'

B002N5N5M0|2.0|I've loved the first three seasons.  I've never been so riveted by a television program.  When I heard that Jon Lithgow was joining the cast I became nervous; bringing on a well-known actor is a classic sign of jumping the shark.  The producers hoped to reinvigorate the brand by bringing in outside help.  If that was all they had done, the season would have been bearable, bland, but bearable.<br /><br />Instead, the show commits a mortal sin--it destroys its winning formula in a desperate attempt to win viewers for the next season.  It won't work.  The series is doomed.  It really is too bad they couldn't resist the urge to milk this cow to death.<br /><br />The real show ended in season 3.  If you want to remember Dexter as a great show, walk away at the end of season three.  Not only will season four be less enjoyable that the previous three, its needlessly harsh \\"shocker\\" ending will make you like the previous seasons less.<br /><br />Just walk away.  Watch something else.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|SOUND AND SFX VERY GOOD,,,,,    STORY LINE THE SAME AS POCAHONTAS BUT IN ANOTHER GALAXY, TIME AND PLANET.....    The Cool thing about this film is that all of the tribe Na'vi are fully compatible high as they can be plugged in any animal on the planet.
B00008LDPU|4.0|While anime-styled productions like Dark Fury, Batman: Gotham Knight, and Van Helsing: The London Assignment try to act as tie-ins to existing movie franchises, The Animatrix was one of the first of these types of animated films. Originally an online series (or \\"ONA\\"), this was a compilation of nine episodes, all dealing with seperate aspects of The Matrix trilogy. Four of these episodes premiered online, while the rest of them were first featured on the video release of the complete movie.<br /><br />The first story, Final Flight Of The Osiris, was animated by Square Pictures, who also did Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. This acts as a direct prelude to The Matrix Reloaded where the human crew of the hovercraft Osiris discover that the machine army is drilling directly into the underground city of Zion, so they send their Aeon Flux-wannabe into the Matrix to deliver this news to the humans. Unfortunately, the machines down the ship, and everyone buys it in the end. This had some pretty decent CGI in it, although it seems mostly dated by today's standards. It also leads into the Enter The Matrix video game.<br /><br />After this is a 2-part story which actually gives a comprehensive history of how the world was eventually taken over by the machines. In The Second Renaissance, Mahiro Madea of Kill Bill fame animated this ellaborate retelling of mankind's downfall from the perspectrive of the Zion computer archives that is represented as a goddess figure called The Instructor. She relays how the human race had created robots to do all their work, but they eventually rebelled. The machines start up their own city, which the humans weirdly enough open up trades with, although this sends the human economy into the sewers. The humans then decide to go to all out war with the machines by blocking out the sun, their main source of power. Of course, the machines eventually win, and begin to harvest the human minds. This origin is not totally compatible with the regular Matrix story as it was stated in the first movie that the entire history was sketchy due to the humans' lack of information on it. This is possibly an idealized version of what was supposed to have happened based on what the future Zionites thought it would be.<br /><br />Next is Kid's Story where we're introduced to the Kid(yep, he's got no real name!), who was that annoying teenager who kept stalking Neo in Reloaded, and how he freed himself from the Matrix. This was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop. World Record(by Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri)follows this same premise about an athlete who almost breaks free of the illusion of the Matrix.<br /><br />Kawajiri also directed the Program segment which is unfortunately the shortest one in the whole movie about a girl training in one of the humans' VR sims which is modeled after feudal Japan, and is nearly taken out by what she is led to believe as a defector to the machines. This part features some very dynamic action, which make you wich that Kawajiri would do another full-length ninja/samurai movie.<br /><br />After this is Beyond(by Koji Morimoto of Memories)where some kids find a glitch in the Matrix which they think is a haunted house. Next is A Detective's Story where a private eye in the Matrix is hired by Agents to hunt down Trinity. Shinichiro Watanabe takes his knack for genre films and applies it beautifully to this noir piece.<br /><br />Finally, is Matriculated by Aeon Flux creator Peter Cheung, where some humans working above-ground to capture robots and try to win them over to their side by using surrealistic VR, although they all end up getting killed off by other robots. This is the longest bit in the anthology, and is well executed, but at the same time gets too bogged down with the entire dreamlike sim used on the robot.<br /><br />The Animatrix represented a major change in the way American animated media was handled, by having it branch out to different media like anime. On its own, it blazes alot of trails, and is worth viewing at least for seeing the eclectic views based on a similar theme. A better example of this would be Robot Carnival which is not currently available in America. Granted, this is a must for anyone who actually dug all three Matrix films, and is available in most of the collected editions of the trilogy.st for seeing the eclectic views based on a similar theme.

0743298039|5.0|You'll pretty much know within a few pages if you want to stick with this book or not: are you the type to spend hours in a bookstore, enjoying the smell of parchment and selecting the perfect volume to read while curled up on a windowseat?  Or would you rather chew off your own arm?    This is Bronte and Austen and moors and Wilke Collins and all of that good stuff, but set in contemporary times with a slightly retro protagonist.  It's as close as you'll get to traveling back in time, without diving into sci fi or fantasy.  I really, really enjoyed the trip, and it's saying something that the author was able to establish the story in the modern day and still genuinely create an atmosphere where you'd believe it if a Moonstone suddenly went missing or a man started thunking his head against a tree in the driving rain.    I put this right next to my copy of \\"The Lady in White\\", and it's right at home there.

B000LAZDQA|3.0|Short Bus is a interesting movie that involves a lot of sexual energy.  It kind of reminds me of state of total sexual confusion and indecision.  I must say that the movie has its highlights as far as frontal nudity and sexual escapades.  I kind of felt a little loss for any major thought on it.  In some words, this movie shows what a state of sexual confusion can mean to some People.  Pleasantly ok with the movie. But is about average.  Reminds me a lot of a \\"B\\" movie.<br /><br />If you like nudity, confusion and drama, this movie has all of it.  Over all I give it three stars because I enjoyed the movie, but still felt it lacked a strong storyline.
B000KQF6X0|4.0|Haven't seen this movie in years, and do not know why I was visited by the urgent prodings of the \\"Have to See it Now\\" angel, but after watching it again, I knew: It is just a good movie! Plot, script, acting, filming, all combine to produce a well-made action movie. How can you lose with Ridley Scott involved.

It held up to time with a good (sad) story line, good acting, and had the added bonus of knowing how low the mighty will eventually fall. I hesitate to say this is a classic, but it certainly comes close, and I'll be interested to see if the \\"sequel\\" will be able to do as well.

B000VI70WM|5.0|Following the return of Andy Taylor Duran Duran began their comeback with the 2004 album [[ASIN:B0002X591A Astronaut]] and followed the album up several years later with this album. The previous album was very well conseived overall yet all the same there was a little bit of a tenative sense when it came to modernizing,especially on the rock oriented songs. On this album Timbaland,The Neptunes and Justin Timberlake are baught into the mix. They were all very hot producers at the time and,honestly all of them were influenced in one way or another by Duran Duran's classic music in the first place among other things. This album has a lot of songs that have a thouroughly 80's electro dance/funk flavors with a lot of nods to the early techno-rock sounds that Duran Duran made famous on their first three albums. \\"The Valley\\",the title song,\\"Box Full Of Honey\\",\\"Skin Divers\\",\\"She's Too Much\\" and \\"Dirty Green Monster\\" all showcase these tricky synthesizer loops arranged into this alaborate little pop soundscapes that,even when they aren't involved owe more than their share of debt to the cross pollination style productions of Timbaland. On the surface the modern instrumentation may sound new for Duran Duran and the generation who originally listened to them may in fact dismiss this as \\"music that sounds like everyone else made only for the kids today\\". However even if such people listen to this they'll realize that the modern production stylings here are indeed just an extention of the style of Duran Duran and other groups from the new wave era. \\"Night-Runner\\" is one of the best songs on the album,finding a wonderful balance between slick 80's pop-funk grooves and new wave. This was explored heavily on the previous album with as well. The one place where this album really jumps to the head of the class is on the rockier numbers. Modern rock can sound very generic in the wrong hands and wind up as something just waiting for an MP3 player or Iphone TV commercial but on songs like \\"Zoom In\\",\\"Falling Down\\",\\"She's Too Much\\" and \\"Last Man Standing\\" the guitar/keyboard and dreamy vocal harmony interaction shows the clever and inventive style in which Duran Duran dealt with in their salad years and are an improvement on the quality of the rock styled material from the previous album. In addition to featuring many great individual songs this album has the built in advantage of standing together as a whole and showcases a possible bright future for Duran Duran's new comeback.mercial but on songs like \\"Zoom In\\",\\"Falling Down\\",\\"She's Too Much\\" and \\"Last Man Standing\\" the guitar/keyboard and dreamy vocal harmony interaction shows the clever and inventive style in which Duran Duran dealt with in their salad years and are an improvement on the quality of the rock styled material from the previous album.

0061537969|2.0|After reading so many raving reviews, I couldn't wait to read this book on vacation. I was surprised early on by how terrible the writing was but kept thinking the storyline would save the book. This was an okay time filler while laying on the beach, but pretty disappointing overall. I'm still shocked this many people loved this book!?
B0036TGSR6|5.0|The Ghost Writer is the perfect suspense thriller, a great cast, and dark mood of a film for its subject matter.  I enjoyed the somber musical score that Mr. Polanski used throughout the film.  The Ghost Writer has the feel and mood of an early 1990's movie like The Russia House, a type of film from yesteryear that has more depth and less superficiality than what Hollywood films presently are about.  I was eager for The Ghost Writer to come out on DVD and am very pleased.  Also a fan of Mr. Roman Polanski as a filmmaker.  This is one of the better films of the year in its style and substance.  I hope to see at least a couple of more films from Director Roman Polanski in the future, notably Gods and Monsters which reportedly is in preproduction, set to start filming in 2011; sure to have another excellent and carefully chosen cast.

B002UNMW7O|4.0|I've heard many people say that they didn't like this film, not just on here but my own friends.  Yet every time I ask them why they didn't like it, not once have I been given specifics.  It's just \\"I didn't think it was as good.\\"  It seems to be the same thing on here with most of these reviews.  I keep seeing \\"weak plot.\\"  What was weak about it?  They went into more detail about the guys' personal lives, particularly Il Duce and how he became who he is.  They pretty much continued with the same ideology as in the first one, with the brothers killing the wicked who hurt the innocent.  I'll admit some of the humor was cheesy, but you can still laugh at it, even if for no other reason because it was cheesy.  The acting isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be.  You're not dealing with Academy Award winners here, so don't expect groundbreaking performances.  But it's good enough to fit the film.  Yes, Julie Benz's accent was a little annoying, but whatever.  I don't know what people were expecting with the sequel.  It followed the same premise, brought back all the same actors, and naturally progressed the story.  I think some of the reviewers here should lower their expectations a bit when it comes to something like this.  There was no way the original was ever going to be topped.  So all Duffy could do was try to make an entertaining film to continue the franchise.  If you don't like it, that's fine.  Can't please everyone.  But at least be complete in your review and explain why you didn't like it, and not just \\"It's weak.\\"
0393072231|4.0|Another eye opening look at the inner workings of big Wall Street brokerage firms and how they ultimately were responsible in large part for the mortgage/housing crisis.  Lewis profiles those who were smart enough and bold enough to bet against the US Mortgage markets, and details how the creation of new derivatives compounded the losses to those who were betting on housing in America.  Perhaps it's not as entertaining as Liar's Poker was, but it's still a great read and provides great insight.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This was a great book from the first page. Enzo takes on a full scale life cycle that you never want to stop reading. Learning about him and the family he has grown to love is very impacting. Makes me think what my dogs tends to think about when we are hanging out or when I am at work.     The story involves a lot of emotion, humor and real life situations. It was difficult yo put it down. I started the book on a business trip on Monday and was done with it on Thursday. I truly I enjoyed this read and would recommend it to dog lovers and those that enjoy a read with emotion and good character portrayal.

No, not really. This was inevitable; when you have nothing left to sell - you sell yourself. Literally. This CD is a familiar stop on the Fame road: Cute, family friendly does'nt sell anymore? Then stop being cute - show your stuff in public, wear clothes and dance like a stripper.     The music? What about it? Most of the \\"songs\\" are pedestrian at best; painfully bad at worst. The music is the thing getting the least amount of attention. The important thing is that people are talking about you. Good, Bad, indifferent - it does'nt matter, in fact \\"bad\\" can help as much as \\"good\\". Now this multi-level   marketing scheme can sell clothes, hats, shoes to a whole new audience.    People, don't fall for this nonsense. Listen to real music. Ignore this attention-starved kid and her pimp father.
0307454541|5.0|I wish we could've learned more about what was going on inside Stieg Larsson's head before he passed. How did he come up with such a twisted topic and manage to turn it in to captivating reading? I couldn't put this book down. I HAD to get to the end to see what happened. Reading this book is exhilarating and exhausting and worth every minute you spend on it. Gearing myself up for reading the next one.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I watched this when it came out 20 years ago, and it was good then. But a 2nd viewing brought out more nuances and humor. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are spectacular as the former Texas Rangers on their last cattle drive. It's a classic!
B000OPOAM0|2.0|What I got was a bare-bones release with a new cover.  The only special feature was a trailer.  Very disappointing.
B001FB5634|5.0|When I first rented this movie and popped it into my dvd player, I didn't really have a clue what to expect. I still didn't even a good bit into the movie. Even about 20-30 minutes in, I still didn't know if I was going to regret spending the money and time on this rental. When the movie ended, I knew it was worth every minute and every cent.    Now I will tell you all why I loved this movie. First, you can easily tell by watching the movie that the director was following his own vision, and not trying to appeal to a mainstream audience. Yes, it is rather bleak and depressing, but that only adds to the movie and the experience. The acting is incredible, and all the characters, even though none of them have names, are very fully realized and highly developed. The movie follows a style that reminds me of the book The Hobbit- the main characters are on a long, treacherous journey, and experience and series of separate and clearly definable events. You are constantly wondering what the characters are about to go through next. The movie also makes you realize that post-apocolyptia sucks, and unlike in the game Fallout 3, there aren't guns everywhere and food is extremely scarce, and viciously fought over.    I really liked this movie. You should probably watch it if it sounds interesting to you, but I also think this movie certainly isn't for everyone.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|This was so good, DC will have a difficult time making another worthy of five stars.  Had the history of Jason Todd been presented in a live action film of some sort, this would have been even better presented as such.  Script was outstanding, and I agree with others the PG-13 rating is warranted.  Before viewing, I was concerned about someone other than Kevin Conroy being the voice of Bruce Wayne/Batman, but I was very, very wrong.  Bruce Greenwood was perfect and I have to hope he remains the voice in any future endeavors.  Jensen Ackles was great as Jason Todd and clearly evoked the despair and pain Jason had felt the past five years.  I did not like the voice of Neil Patrick Harris as Dick Grayson/Night Wing.  Too youthful sounding. John DiMaggio as the Joker was stable, I got used to him with every spoken word, but just not up to the level of Mark Hamill.  Hamill's higher pitched voice is better suited for a homicidal character with white skin, green hair, a painted smile and purple clothes. The ending was great and Batman displayed the choice he would have made had he had the chance the first time around.  I read all the comics related to this storyline and what was left in, what was taken out, didn't deter one bit.  I hope a second movie is made to follow up to the conclusion of this story, which leaves us hanging as to the fate of Jason Todd.  Of course, no one ever REALLY dies.
0143038419|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love is about a recently divorced writer who journeys to Italy, India and Indonesia to heal and find herself again.  I thought this was an entertaining memoir.  If I was looking for a spiritual revelation, I would have been disappointed.  I felt she was open and honest, sometimes uncomfortably so.  This may have been construed as whining or narcissistic, but this is her memoir and I feel it was needed to accurately portray her state of mind.<br /><br />This is a good book for a book club party.  The food and decoration options are limitless.  Her experiences in each of the countries opened up many discussions about the book and inspired people to tell their own stories.  Each person had their own opinions about Elizabeth Gilbert, with some of us identifying with her need to get away to find herself, secretly wishing we could do the same, while others thought she was a self-indulgent whiner.<br /><br />She brings to light an important fact that I think many people face.  When you have achieved everything you wanted, you realize it might not be everything you wanted.  I think she sums it up well when she says \\"I have searched frantically for contentment for so many years in so many ways, and all these acquisitions and accomplishments-they run you down in the end.  At some point ...you gotta let go and sit still and allow contentment to come to you.\\"

1594488916|2.0|I thought this sounded like an awesome book.  It discusses the world of Bibliomania  in general and specifically two men are deep into the industry (one who steals rare books and the man whose mission it was to find him).  I love books and love learning about them and was excited to learn more about this industry.  Overall I was not impressed with this book.  The author jumps around between stories, different points of view, and her personal experiences kind of willy nilly.  She also doesn't ever really give or get any intriguing insight into why people do these things; besides the conclusions that anyone could make with a couple minutes of thought.<br /><br />I listened to this on audio book, which I would not recommend, the lady who read the story kind of mumbled and didn't differentiate between characters at all.<br /><br />From what I gathered Bartlett started researching this topic as a newspaper article and it grew into a book.  You can definitely tell.  This would have been find as a newspaper feature but as a book it left a lot to be desired.  Bartlett mainly focuses on John Gilkey, a reknown rare book thief, and Ken Sanders, a Bibliodick set on catching book thieves.<br /><br />The most positive part of this book is the look into the world of rare book dealing.  Some of this information is very interesting.  Unfortunately for me that was the most positive part of this book.<br /><br />Bartlett switches between Gilkey's stories and Sanders' stories without much organization or reason.  Then she intersperses sections on how she feels she fits into the world of bibliomania and what her thoughts on the whole issue are.  She spends quite a bit of time sympathizing with Gilkey and not nearly enough time discussing the impacts of his book theft.  Towards the end of the book there is one lady whose story she tells briefly, that gives you a bit of an idea of what kind of impact stealing a $5000 book has on a rare book store, but that's it.<br /><br />I failed to find Gilkey as intriguing as the author did.  Gilkey was a plain old stupid criminal, the only thing that sets him apart are his calm attitude and his complete lack of morality.  Although I guess a lot of criminals lack morality.  Gilkey wasn't even clever and most of the time seemed to be just plain old lucky.  I was hoping for a tale of clever deception and what I got was a tale of a criminal with some luck who was up against an inefficient system of law that has bigger things to worry about than stolen books.<br /><br />Sanders was a more interesting person and he really seemed to make some changes in the overall system that helped catch book thieves.<br /><br />The conclusions that Bartlett draws are less than awe-inspiring.  Basically people collect things because they want people to admire them.  I was disappointed that the whole build up in this book leaves us with that basic message.  I know this is a non-fiction book but the closure of it was also pretty...well...lame.  At the end of the book not much had changed from the beginning.  As the reader we know a smidge more about rare book collecting and some might learn more about collecting as a type of disability.  Personally I didn't learn anything I didn't already know about people who are crazy about collecting things.<br /><br />Overall, this short book seemed like a much longer read than books twice its length.  There is some interesting information; but it is bogged down by constant switches in who is telling what story, a lack of empathy for the people being stolen from, and only minimal insight into why people do the things they do.  Basically I thought it was boring and a waste of time.  I almost stopped listening to it on more than one occasion but kept telling myself \\"really it's not that long, you should be able to get through this...\\".

B002ZG99G8|4.0|This is a solid popcorn movie that also doesn't insult your intelligence (well, not too much).  It seem like often Hollywood movies have to be both smart and pretentious, or just mindless entertainment.  Here we have a smart movie that's really all about the ride, not the sermon.  That's refreshing.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|One of the best movies ever! And the extended version too. Killing Zoe and the French version of le Femme Nikita have the same feel too.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|When did Spielberg start going downhill? I'd say some time in the late 1980s. You can see signs in The Last Crusade: the stunt-casting of Sean Connery, the silly scene with Hitler, and perhaps the over-extended tank chase. Since then, I haven't enjoyed anything he's made (except Jurassic Park), which is remarkable considering how wonderful his earlier films were.  We can gauge his fall by comparing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with the earlier Indiana Jones movies.<br /><br />First, despite what the cinematographer says (in a featurette) about duplicating the look of the old films, this sequel is visually much less interesting. Do a direct comparison: the early films have tight compositions, lots of interesting movement through the frame, and dramatic high-contrast lighting. Kingdom's shots tend to be excessively wide, boringly composed, and overlit, making the image look flat and bland. I thought the absolute worst moment was the diner scene, which was awkwardly set up, mostly stuck in one long shot, and with a deep focus that brought out every detail of the busy background and was painfully distracting. You'll also notice, throughout the action scenes, not one close-up of Jones looking frightened, in pain, flustered or relieved, whereas in the early films these shots helped us empathise with the character, adding to the drama and being really a signature of the series.<br /><br />Kingdom unfortunately models its structure on recent action movies, which means action, action, action, always at the expense of character. The problem with this is that if you don't care about the characters, you don't care about the action. Also, the application of modern techniques eliminates the rough-and-ready quality of the action in the old films, which made them wonderfully believable. The use of motion-controlled cameras, the obvious CG clean-up, the flow of unbelievable stunt after unbelievable stunt, all these make action scenes look slick and fake. That we are supposed to believe a 65 year old man could do all these things (including things much more difficult than in any of the previous films) is the final dealbreaker. Probably the worst offender of the action scenes is the jungle chase, which is ten or fifteen minutes of pure fantasy, most notably Mutt continuing a sword fight for five minutes while astride two speeding jeeps. With so much silly Stuff happening during this scene, it quickly becomes a bore. It's directly followed by the army ant scene, which did have the potential to be a classic Indiana Jones moment, but was undermined by immediately following the exhausting jungle chase, and by being boringly directed. There's some running around and screaming, but our heroes hardly feature.<br /><br />The story is not bad in itself, but is spoiled by various silly things, such as: Jones walking TOWARDS the mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb; Mutt wanting to rescue some old guy for no compelling reason I could gather; Jones mispronouncing &#34;libary&#34; (though I'm sure everyone on set thought it was hilarious); cunningly evading the Russian spies by going home and staying there; Inca ninjas (totally unexplained); reintroducing Marion and then not giving her any decent scenes with Jones; a middle and last act with five potentially interesting characters (six including the villainess) and no interesting dramatic scenes at all; more ninjas; an elaborate gate-unlocking scene which was done for real but LOOKS computer generated; Jones rushing into the skull chamber when a tentative creep would've been more dramatically interesting (but hey, why start now?); the portal to other dimensions looking like a big extractor fan; the villain dissolving in a CGI haze when we all wanted to see her head explode; Jones's &#34;surprise son&#34; looking nothing like him; and the groan-inducing applause at the wedding (a moment which the film had definitely not earned).<br /><br />So what's GOOD about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Well, most of the actors do what they can with their underwritten parts (though I still think Cate Blanchett is overrated), and the production design, costuming, etc, are of a high standard. (John Williams' music sounded good in its featurette, but I hardly noticed it in the film.) There were a lot of good IDEAS in the story: retrieving an item from the mysterious government warehouse, the atomic test village (though it seemed to belong in a different story), the return of Marion, the South American setting. I even think the &#34;aliens&#34; plot had potential. It's just that in almost every case the execution of the idea failed to deliver.<br /><br />Let's just be thankful they won't be making any more of these.en parts (though I still think Cate Blanchett is overrated), and the production design, costuming, etc, are of a high standard.

B002SG8A56|5.0|After two seasons, Flight of the Conchords ended its run on HBO. The show, about a folk duo trying to survive in New York City, is quite honestly one of the funniest and inventive comedies I've ever seen on the small screen. Infused with great songs and a fantastic supporting cast, the Conchords rises above most other comedy shows you've most likely seen. The second season finds the show hitting its creative stride and is even funnier than the first with some hilarious cameos and better overall production value. Also included is a bonus cd with several of the Conchords hits recorded before they were well known.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This movie has a lot of positive points to it that made it worth watching.  First, the acting was well done.  Pierce Brosnan, Kim Cattrall, Ewan McGregor, and Olivia Williams play characters who are complex, mysterious, and delightfully hard to predict.  Secondly, the ambiance of the film is spot-on.  The bleak atmosphere is foreboding and unsettling with its stark cinematography and the feeling like your every move is being watched from the opening scene.  Lastly, the plot is full of murky twists and turns that keep you guessing what will happen through the very last scene.  Add all of these things together and you end up with a movie that makes you feel nervous, uncomfortable, and agitated - just like a good political thriller should.    The story begins when a ghost writer, hired to write the memoirs for a former British Prime Minister, washes up dead on the shores of Martha's Vineyard.  Things only get more dangerous and bizarre when a second ghost writer is hired to finish the job and finds a trail of strange clues that his predecessor left behind. What's eventually uncovered is an intricate plot involving murder, terrorism, and the CIA.    I found this ominous and understated political thriller to be definitely worth watching.  Anyone who likes being slowly drawn into films with disturbed characters, dark plot twists, and shocking endings shouldn't be disappointed in this one.

1595141979|4.0|This book took a much more central focus of the relationship between Rose and Dimitri, as well as Rose's own unique abilities, thanks to her bond with Lissa. This book delved more into what harnessing the elements could do in practical terms, which I have been very curious about. In some ways, I feel like Mead is holding back in terms of telling the reader all the ways that Spirit can be used, but that is writer's privilege. My favorite part of the books is always Rose's relationship with Dimitri, so much so that I feel everything that she feels, laugh when she laughs, etc. Without spoiling the ending, I can definitely say I felt just as much as she did at the end.<br />It is interesting to see the effect that Rose and Lissa are collectively having on the political and social structures of this world that Mead has constructed. Unwritten rules that previously were unquestioned are now being broken repeatedly - and not just by Rose. Other Moroi are trying to wield compulsion, male Dhampirs are refusing to become guardians, Moroi are learning to wield their abilities offensively and train under guardians, and so on. Lissa falls under many exceptions, being the only Dragomir, which ironically puts Rose even more in the spotlight of society and allows her to be a catalyst for change.
0525423842|1.0|Picked up this book in the bookshop, read a couple of pages, and was engaged.  Being a new release it still full price, but I really wanted to read on so, seeing as it was a Grisham novel, I assumed it would be money well spent (was sadly mistaken)!  The book started off well and continued to build (if somewhat slowly) to a point where the main character (a child) needs to involve older & wiser members of his family.  From this point on the story becomes pretty ordinary and everyday - I'd even say boring.  There was a menacing character who lurked around the edges of the story, but he never really became anyone of consequence.  As I read the final page I actually thought that I must have bought an unfinished copy of the book!  \\"It must be a mis-print\\", I thought.  But no, It was not!  I got on the web to check how many chapters were supposed to be in the book only to find lots of other readers were also left bewildered and dis-satisfied by the sudden end.  Can't believe I paid full price.  Bummer!  Will make sure I only buy cheap 2nd hand Grishams from now on!

B0035G5IOE|5.0|Ordinarily, I watch a movie one time.  On rare occasion, twice.  Has to be a really special movie (or highly quotable, a la Caddyshack or Pulp Fiction) for me to desire multiple viewings.    That said, I can't stop watching \\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\\".  The animation is fascinating, the voices are perfect, and the writing and vibe are pure Wes Anderson.  On every subsequent viewing, more details come to light.  The expressions on the faces of the characters, the way they eat (you'll have to see it), etc.  Can't stop watching.  Every wordless gesture invites repeated viewing.  i.e., something as simple as Kylie shrugging his shoulders and grinning caused me to watch it over and over.  Same with Ash turning to look at the camera after a redemption of sorts.      I'm almost embarrassed by how much I like this movie.  I'm 46 years old, for crying out loud.  But I do.

B00000J7JO|3.0|A great album by any measure, fantastic melody, hooks and changes. John was back on guitar and showing why he never should have left. HOWEVER... This is one of the worst examples of mastering of an album you will ever hear. Some moron at the label decided that it should be an ultra loud mastering with plenty of compression. If I want a CD to sound louder, you know what, I'll just turn the volume up on my stereo and bingo! it's now louder. I was early 20's when this was released with a cheap stereo and I never really noticed how bad the mastering was. Now I'm 30+ with decent hifi gear and the sound of this album just makes you want to put both barrels in front of your face, it is sooooo distorted in the louder songs that it is nearly unlistenable. It is the sort of album (Metallica's Death Magnetic included) that when you put it on loud you start hunting around for a loose cable or maybe someone has turned the bass setting up on the amp or sub to the point that it drowns out the rest of the music, but no the album just naturally sounds like pure distortion with an absolute lack of dynamic range. Check out \\"loudness wars\\" on wiki if you want a clear explanation of what is going on on this album.

1400162556|5.0|I am a long time dog guardian and dog lover and have read many dog-related books.  This book is about the best I have ever experienced in terms of improving one's understanding of dogs and their actions.  Not only was the book well-written in an interesting and easy to understand style, the audiobook was also exceptionally well spoken.  I learned many new things from this book, and I also appreciated the many references to dog rescue groups and the promotion of mixed breed dogs at shelters/rescues over pure breed dogs as family pets.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|So many songs from the concert were not on the CD.  They should have skipped the DVD and produced a double CD.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Marilyn Manson started out by following the footsteps and holding the hand of his master, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Both his first two albums, Portrait of an American Family and Antichrist Superstar, had a Nine Inch Nails feel to it, certainly due to Trent's prominent presence. Mechanical Animals was the first Manson record that broke away from the feel. It has industrial influences for sure, but not to the point where Nine Inch Nails fans can say \\"oh, this is definitely the work of Trent Reznor\\". Manson pulls from David Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and created a fictional moniker for himself, Omega. The album apparently has two sides to it, Omega and The Mechanical Animals and Marilyn Manson. The self-depracating and nihilistic songs belong to the Omega alter-ego while the more introspective songs belong to Marilyn. Compared to Marilyn Mason's other work, this is his most melodic and accessible record. Sonically, the album is much much less abrasive than Antichrist Superstar and HolyWood. The \\"woman\\" of the Triptych, if I may say. One of my personal favorites, I find this albuma and era one of Manson's best.
0743277465|1.0|The Art of Learning is not about learning. At least a couple reviewers said it ought to be retitled, \\"The Art of Josh.\\" This is a pretty good idea. But a perhaps even more accurate title would be, \\"Some Basic Truisms about Sports Psychology.\\"<br /><br />The first 50 pages of the book begin innocently enough. I was enjoying it quite a bit. Josh tells his story as a child chess-champion and national celebrity. It's a rather charming story, which is probably why they made a movie of it. Waitzkin also lays out a few introductory ideas about learning theory, namely that the idea that intelligence is fixed is a fallacy, and that anyone can learn. Wonderful theme! Worthy of a whole book! But this is the last we hear of learning theory, and the last we hear of how ordinary people are prone to underestimating their ability.<br /><br />It is clear that Waitzkin did almost no research into learning theory for his book. He references no more than two or three theories and studies. This really shows a great lack of effort in versing oneself in the subject matter one claims to be an expert on. Learning theory is actually a hugely active field in academia. It's been a hot topic for decades among psychologists, and studies are published just about every day in the study of learning. Then there is a whole other more theoretical field of education philosophy: what the aims of learning should be, and what are the best ways to learn and teach. Don't expect any of this kind of discussion from Waitzkin. This book was a marvelous opportunity to popularize and synthesize scholarly work in the field of learning, the conclusions of which are very uplifting in their insistence on human possibility.<br /><br />But Josh is more interested in mulling over himself. After the story of his childhood ends and he expounds his one basic idea about learning, the rest of the book is all about his tai chi (much less interesting than chess); his armchair dabblings in Taoism, Kerouac, and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance; and his commonplace tips on competitive psychology. Josh tells us all about his coming of age and transition into manhood. The story loses all its charm here. The book becomes a phallocentric and narcissistic male fantasy. Josh talks about he moves to Slovenia to be with his femme fatale girlfriend, escaping the suffocating fame surrounding him in New York, hiking through the mountains of Balkans thinking about chess and Taoism, being a dharma bum and backpacking through Europe playing chess tournaments, waxing philosophical about being a winner. When I read this portion of the book I got the impression that Waitzkin in his fame is cut off from and doesn't understand the way life is for ordinary people.<br /><br />You can tell this is the case because the book lacks warmth and compassion. It's not about learning, its about \\"destroying opponents.\\" Not once does Josh say, \\"you don't need to be a world-champ to be a somebody.\\" He never says, \\"whether its gardening or being a great parent that you want to learn, you are a champion in your own right.\\" No -- it's all about how to kill your opponents, how to win fights with a broken arm, and how to stay focused during grueling six-hour struggles. The books devolves into chapter after chapter of banal tips about how to compete, stuff Josh is too self-absorbed to realize is not relevant to any audience other than himself. You hear several times about how he likes to wash his face and do a 100 meter dash to clear his mind during a chess game. Or, how eating greasy food before a tai chi fight is bad. Thanks, Josh. Next time I'm at the World Championship of Awesomeness I will remember that. One whole chapter is about how Josh allegedly conquered this other guy's performance anxiety by having him build up calming associations to Bob Dylan and other things, and recalling these associations right before he was expected to perform. This amounts to nothing more than a dumbed down lesson in Skinnerian classical conditioning (experiments famously conducted on dogs, let's recall). If Josh truly thinks you can attain transcendental focus just by linking it to a proverbial jingle of a bell, then he really has no concept of the depth of human psychology. (On that note, David Foster Wallace once correlated professional sports performers with profoundly simple psychological makeups.) But I don't think Josh actually believes this; he was just trying to fill up pages because he ran out of things to say about learning theory about 150 pages ago.<br /><br />If I had the opportunity to write a book like this, I would use every word trying to uncondition people from the tragic fallacy that they are static creatures and cannot learn new proficiencies and raise their overall intelligence. In this culture, the cult of the champion is just a reflection of the sad myth of making us all believe we're born-losers and lack the stuff of greatness. So we give up and limit ourselves. Education, media, and scientific institutions all conspire to tell us we cannot change ourselves and our lot in life is perfectly just. Josh doesn't understand any of this because he is the typical champion. His book is about being a winner, with the occasional addition made by his editors about seizing the day \\"in the boardroom\\" (ugh). It is therefore an alienating read that is not likely to motivate and instruct ordinary people in growing as individuals. The truth is, you don't need some spoiled narcissist who can't write, like Josh, tell you how to grow. The power lies within.<br /><br />A person interested in studying learning theory and how to be a more \\"effective\\" person ought to, instead, begin by browsing by category \\"Learning\\" on Wikipedia and discovering the immense amount of topics in the field.cal conditioning (experiments famously conducted on dogs, let's recall).

B000001Y2U|5.0|The title of this review may come across as derogatory, but rest assured that it certainly isn't. Trent Reznor and his Nine Inch Nails cronies had a big hand in producing and creating this record and shaping Marilyn Manson's music. There's definitely a salient Nine Inch Nails feel in the overall sound of this record. Manson's and Twiggy's songwriting do become heroes at the end of the day, however. Twiggy and his heavy yet melodic guitar riffs decorate Manson's angry and politically charged lyrics. Manson's vocals are impossible to emulate and it really is what brings this record to the forefront. Very little artists have come to match Trent Reznor's nakedness when it comes to conveying feelings on a song and Marilyn Manson is one of the fortunate few. In addition to the vocals, the sonically abrasive guitars, synths, and \\"noise\\" shape a record that matches the title precisely. This is the critcally acclaimed album that broke the gate for Marilyn Manson. It's definitely well-deserved.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|An amazing document, recorded mid-July, 2008 in London, when Leonard Cohen was doing a world tour. He was only 73 years old. And so, despite long years of semi-retirement, and many more spent on Mount Baldy becoming a Zen monk, he still came out and gave us his beautiful songs in that great virtuosic touring way where he was a ringmaster of an army of splendid musicians. We see this treatment from godfathers like David Gilmour and David Bowie, but Leonard Cohen has been doing it for many more years than those fellows and it's incredible to behold. Cohen and his band play two sets - the first one is 57 minutes long, the second one is one hour, 40 minutes long (actually, the second set is one hour long, and the encores are another 40 minutes long). Cohen has so many amazing songs that the stream of major classics just goes on and on, until way, deep in the set when he plays \\"Take This Waltz,\\" which probably not one of his recognised classics. The production is rich and full, making it quite different from the \\"Field Commander Cohen: Tour Of 1979' release, which is spare by comparison, focussing on acoustic guitar, duets with Jennifer Warnes, violin solos from Raffi Hakopian, and jazzy fretless bass.<br /><br />His entire set Live in London is spotless, with the only real comparisons his amazing tours of the past. In this case, he starts his London set off with the words \\"Thank you so much, friends, so very kind of you to come to this...,\\" he's drowned out in applause, and then the band kicks in to \\"Dance Me To The End Of Love\\", with its electric clarinet, three backup singers, and the weird motions of 12-string guitarist Javier Mas (who also breaks out the banduria, laud, archilaud and is full of dramatic gestures). Curtains setting the mood onstage. Leonard Cohen sings, passionately gripping the microphone. \\"Thanks so much, friends. It's wonderful to be gathered here just on the other side of intimacy. I'm so pleased that you're here. I know some of you have undergone financial and geographical inconvenience. We're honoured to play for you tonight.\\" Breaks into \\"The Future\\", where he waters down the lyrics \\"Give me crack and anal sex\\" to \\"Give me crack and careless sex\\". He has fun with the lyrics \\"white man dancing\\", when he and the bass player do a little boogie, and when he alters a lyric \\"white women dancing\\", the two white backup singers (Charley and Hattie Webb, the Webb Sisters) do a little jig. \\"It's been a long time since I stood on a stage in London. It was about 14-15 years ago, I was 60 years old, just a kid with a crazy dream. Since then, I've taken a lot of Prozac, Paxol, Wellbuttrin, Exexor, Ritalin; I've also studied TV and the philosophies and the religions, and cheerfulness kept breaking through. But I want to tell you something that will not easily be contradicted - there ain't no cure for love!\\" Breaks into a great sax intro for a stunning version of \\"Ain't No Cure For Love,\\" followed by the best version of \\"Bird on a Wire\\" ever, toned down but with strong keyboards. This song, although it's vastly famous, has never been a favourite of mine; nevertheless, it's become gospel to the extent that I've met people who want these lyrics on their gravestones. Some drums and bass, swelling female backups, mandolin, great blues solo from Bob Metzger playing a semi-hollow body `72 Fender Telecaster Thinline. Sax solo.<br /><br />The band plays \\"Everybody Knows\\", after which Cohen announces \\"I wrote that song a long time ago with Sharon Robinson. More recently we wrote this one,\\" and they play \\"In My Secret Life\\", a semi-duet between Cohen and Robinson, great blues guitars and organs, mild drums and bass; there's a two-minute Spanish archilaud intro for \\"Who By Fire\\", with its cool upright bass (great banging on the body for the outro bass roll), backup singer Hattie Webb on harp, Spanish solo on the larchilaud, a groovy organ solo, and Cohen plays the Godin classical guitar that is featured on the cover. Perfect - thishas long been one of my favourite Cohen songs. He continues to play the Godin on \\"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye.\\" Great harmonica solo. Between-song banter is often a recitation of the vocals of the next song, and when he says \\"there is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in,\\" we know he's going to sing \\"Anthem.\\" Great lyric - \\"While the killers in high places say their prayers out loud.\\" It's the last song that they play before the intermission, although before they go offstage, Cohen introduces each of the members (he'd been doing it from time to time throughout the set as well).<br /><br />After a break, they come out, and Cohen has a bit of an intro. \\"I was having a drink with my teacher, he's 102 now. He was about 97 at the time. I poured him a drink, he clicked my glass and he said `excuse me for not dying.' (laughter) I kind of feel the same way. I want to think you, not just for this evening but for the many years you've kept my songs alive.\\" Starts up a Technics keyboard, sings \\"Tower of Song\\", with female backups. At his age, lyrics like \\"I ache in the places I used to play\\" probably have more meaning with each passing year. The song drones on at the end, with the backup singers going on and on with their \\"da doo dum dum dum, da doo dum dum.\\" Cohen launches into a long spiel: \\"Don't stop, don't leave me here alone, don't ever stop. Sing me to bed and sing me through the morning, because I'm so grateful to you because tonight it's become clear to me, tonight the great mysteries have unravelled and I've penetrated to the very core of things, and I have stumbled on the answer; and I'm not the sort of chap who would keep this to himself - do you want to hear the answer? Are you truly hungry for the answer? Then you're just the people I want to tell it to. Because it's a rare thing to come upon it, and I'll let you in on it now. The answer to the mysteries...\\" and he makes a hand gesture towards the backup singers, \\"...is `da doo dum dum...\\"<br /><br />Cohen does a short Spanish intro to \\"Suzanne\\" on the Godin and sings that marvelous song. There's a great version of \\"The Gypsy Wife\\", with a stunning mandolin freakout, Cohen playing the Godin throughout. Female vocals start, Cohen comes in after one line. There's bass solo, but the camera has a lousy angle and we barely see it. Cohen and Robinson then launch in to \\"Boogie Street\\" (which, apparently, is named after a street in Singapore called Bugis Street -the local pronunciation of which sounds like \\"Boogie Stree\\"). Robinson takes over several verses, with Cohen doing backup. \\"Hallelujah\\" is splendid, with a groovy organ solo. \\"I'm Your Man\\" has a cool electric clarinet solo. He then continues with a spoken word segment that becomes a long recital, accompanied by light organ swells, of the lyrics of an alternate version of \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\" that is titled \\"Recitation W/N.L.\\":<br /><br />You came to me this morning and you handled me like meat<br />You'd have to be a man to know how good that feels, how sweet<br />My mirrored twin, my next of kin, I'd know you in my sleep<br />And who but you would take me in, a thousand kisses deep.<br /><br />I loved you when you opened, like a lily to the heat<br />You see, I'm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet<br />Who loved you with his frozen love, his second-hand physique<br />With all he is and all he was, a thousand kisses deep<br /><br />I know you had to lie to me, I know you had to cheat<br />To pose all hot and high behind the veils of sheer deceit<br />Our perfect porn aristocrat, so elegant and cheap<br />I'm old, but I'm still into that, a thousand kisses deep<br /><br />I'm good at love, I'm good at hate, it's in between I freeze<br />I've been working out, but it's too late, it's been too late for years<br />But you look fine, you really do, they love you on the Street<br />If you were here I'd kneel for you, a thousand kisses deep<br /><br />The autumn moved across your skin, got something in my eye<br />A light that doesn't need to live and doesn't need to die<br />A riddle in the book of love, obscure and obsolete<br />`Till witnessed here in time and blood, a thousand kisses deep<br /><br />And I'm still workin' with the wine, still dancing cheek to cheek<br />The band is playing `Auld Lang Syne\\", but the heart will not retreat<br />I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray, I never had their sweep<br />But once or twice they let me play, a thousand kisses deep<br /><br />I loved you when you opened, like a lily to the heat<br />You see - I'm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet<br />Who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique<br />With all he is and all he was, a thousand kisses deep<br /><br />But you don't need to hear me now, and every word I speak<br />It counts against me anyhow, a thousand kisses deep.<br /><br />Incidentally, that is transcribed from the video itself; the lyrics that are provided by the DVD itself are different:<br /><br />Recitation W/N.L.<br /><br />You came to me this morning<br />And you handled me like meat<br />You'd have to be a man to know<br />HOw good that feels how sweet<br />My mirror twin my next of kin<br />I'd know you in my sleep<br />And who but you would take me in<br />A thousand kisses deep<br />I loved you when you opened<br />Like a lily to the heat<br />I'm just another snowman<br />Standing in the rain and sleet<br />Who loved you with his frozen love<br />His second-hand physique<br />With all he is and all he was<br />A thousand kisses deep<br />I know you had to lie to me<br />I know you had to cheat<br />To pose all hot and high behind<br />The veils of sheer deceit<br />Our perfect porn aristocrat<br />So elegant and cheap<br />I'm old but I'm still into that<br />A thousand kisses deep<br />And I'm still working with the wine<br />Still dancind cheek to cheek<br />The band is plainy Auld Lang Syne<br />The heart will not retreat<br />I ran with Diz and Dante<br />I never had their sweep<br />But once or twice they let me play<br />A thousand kisses deep<br />The autumn slipped across your skin<br />Got something in my eye<br />A light that doesn't need to live<br />And doesn't need to die<br />A riddle in the book of love<br />Obscure and obsolete<br />`Till witnessed here in time and blood<br />A thousand kisses deep<br />I'm good at love I'm good at hate<br />It's in between I freeze<br />Been working out but it's too late<br />It's been too late for years<br />But you look fine you really do<br />The pride of Boogie Street<br />Somebody must have died for you<br />A thousand kisses deep<br />I loved you when you opened<br />Like a lily to the heat<br />I'm just another snowman<br />Standing in the rain and sleet<br />But you don't need to hear me now<br />And every wort I speak<br />It counts against me anyhow<br />A thousand kisses deep.<br /><br />A few changes: other than the order of the sections, he mentions specifically Boogie Street (Singapore's Bugis Street, which the song \\"Boogie Street\\" is supposedly named after, was in the past notorious for trans-sexual activity), and instead of \\"Diz\\" and \\"Ray\\", he talks about Diz and \\"Dante.\\" Okay.<br /><br />After that recitation, the most interesting original bit in the concert so far, the band breaks into \\"Take This Waltz,\\" a minor song from \\"Various Positions\\", and not really one of my favourites. But here it sounds lovely, brought out by great accompaniment from Hattie Webb, whose gorgeous voice is heavenly.<br /><br />Cohen tries to take leave of the stage, and even gets the band off, but is quickly back for an encore that is to last nearly as long as the second half of the concert (providing a full third act, it seems). The band breaks into a jaunty version of \\"So Long, Marianne\\", then gets into a funky, waist-swinging \\"First We Take Manhattan\\". Starts off with funky bass intro, then gets intense with lots of energy and dancing. The Web Sisters come through again as great, great backups. \\"Sisters of Mercy\\" is very good, with a nice opportunity for another archilaud solo (in nearly three hours of live music, you're bound to get a few archilaud solos). To introduce \\"If It Be Your Will\\", one of Cohen's most beautiful songs, which he first sang with the sublime Jennifer Warnes, Cohen croaks out a verse or two before turning it over to the Webb Sisters, Charley working the mini-harp while Hattie takes the guitar (I think it's a Gibson acoustic, not sure). The women re-define the concept of vocal harmonies, it's stunning; and just to prove the point, when they finish their set, we get a shot of Cohen looking on, mesmerised. He snaps to it, and introduces \\"Closing Time\\", probably the funniest song he's ever written, and things get funky. He tries to make this his closing song (hint-hint), but all he does is run offstage and run back onstage again for a 10:30 version of \\"I Tried To Leave You\\" (hint-hint again), a gorgeous, undiscovered gem from \\"New Skin For The Old Ceremony\\". This song is littered with solos - a guitar solo immediately followed by a sax solo, then an organ solo, then a Sharon Robertson vocal bit flowering up the first verse of the song. This is followed by more archilaud from Javier Mas, then \\"the sublime Webb Sisters\\" doing their mmm mmm mmm, ha ha ha..., gettin' sexy `n' hot `n' heavy (most impressive), then a cool electric bass solo (first of the evening, remarkably), a light drum solo, then Cohen solos/improvs:<br /><br />Goodnight my darlin'<br />I hope you're satisfied<br />The bed is kind of narrow<br />But my arms are open wide<br />Yes and here's a man, he's still working for your smile<br /><br />The song winds down after that... and the guys all ome out from behind the instruments to sing \\"Whither Thou Goest\\" as a vocal version - Robinson and Cohen's voices come out clearest. The song lasts less than a minute, and the lyrics are:<br /><br />Wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge<br />Thy people shall be my people<br />Whither thou goest, I will go<br /><br />At the end of the film, we get a single credit:<br /><br />\\"Sincerely, L. Cohen\\".<br /><br />Awesome.<br /><br />Only complaint - Cohen introduces the band members too many times. He's constantly adoring his band, his audience, and humbling himself; you're also dying to hear him say, after he's introduced the band, \\"... and my name is Leonard Cohen.\\" What applause that would get! Instead, we get \\"The sweet shepherd of stings, on the laud, Javier Mas; the master of breath on the instrument of wind, Dino Soldo; the signature of steady, on the pedal steel and the electric guitar, Bob Metzger; the prince of precision, our timekeeper - on the drums, Rafel Bernardo Gayol; on the Hammond B3 and the keyboards, the inpeccable Neil Larsen; my collaborator, the incomparable Sharon Robinson; Hattie and Charley Webb, the sublime Webb sisters; our guardian and sentry, the musical director on the upright and the electric bass, Roscoe Beck.\\" This is how he ends the concert (before the many encores), he did the same at the end of the first part.<br /><br />Okay, maybe a few more complaints: the unnecessary mouth-harp solo in \\"So Long, Marianne\\"; the song has become weirdly cheerful, while it was always sort of wistful, this cheapens it a bit.

B001DHXT1G|5.0|I watched the original series as a child and loved it. I thought this movie did a great job portraying The Incredible Hulk. I watched the other version and of the two movies this is definitely my favorite version. Edward Norton is fantastic ! It's movie you can watch with the entire family.
0545123283|5.0|Plot Summary:  Sam has been cured of the need to shift into wolf form when the temperature drops, and he and Grace are just starting to think about their future together.  Sam is reluctant to step into Beck's shoes and take responsibility for the wolves, but he's forced into the role when one of the new wolves emerges sooner than expected.  Cole is a cocky young man with a death wish, and Sam doesn't trust him at all.  Before Grace and Sam can truly enjoy their moment in the sun, unforeseen issues start to tear them apart.<br /><br />(THE WOLVES OF MERCY FALLS TRILOGY: BOOK TWO)<br /><br />Linger is not the same kind of story as its predecessor, Shiver, but it is no less amazing.  Shiver was all about burgeoning young love.  Linger is all about trying to hold onto love that's slipping away.  What's absolutely fantastic is that I thought I had it all figured out during the first half, but the second half showed me just how wrong I was.  Linger evolved into something far more nuanced and complex than I had originally pictured, and the ending had me all jittery and tingly, like I was on a prolonged adrenaline high.  This is tragic young love at its finest, and I think this series could give Romeo and Juliet a run for its money.<br /><br />I've said this before, but I'll say it again - Sam is just too good to be true.  Anyone with a female heart secretly hopes to find her own Sam one day.  Maggie Stiefvater taps into the mega-romance well without making it corny, or cheesy, or embarrassing.  I don't know how she does it, but those little moments she crafts are shiver-inducing, and extremely rare in my reading experience.  The best part is that they crop up when least expected.  Here's part of a scene where Sam and Grace are writing out their resolutions for the year:<br /><br />I wrote Get a job.  He wrote Keep loving my job.  I wrote Stay madly in love.  He wrote Stay human.<br />\\"Because I'll always be madly in love,\\" he said, looking at his index card instead of my face.<br />I kept looking at him, his eyes hidden behind his lashes, until he lifted them back up to me.<br /><br />(pg. 24)<br /><br />Initially, I wasn't all that happy with the introduction of a new major character into what I like to think of as the \\"Sam and Grace\\" show, but Cole's character slid into place like a missing puzzle piece.  He's a man who thinks he has nothing to lose, while Grace and Sam focus on each other with the same gravitational pull of the Earth orbiting the sun.  It was a powerful contrast to see these individuals fighting so hard for opposite goals.<br /><br />Whenever I finish a really good book, my first thought upon leaving the last page is `What's next?'  So I popped over to Ms. Stiefvater's delightful blog, where she had this to say on July 20, 2010:<br /><br />\\"Now that LINGER is out, out, out, out, officially out in the wild, I am getting many, many, many emails asking me to please write another book. I probably don't have to tell people who read my blog this but yes, the Shiver trilogy is in fact, a trilogy, which means there is a third book, as trilogies are wont to have.

B001GCUO4S|5.0|You know, I tend to find the Final Destination series to be among the SCARIEST of all the horror films out there.  This is because the actual horror comes in the way of REAL possibilities.     Alright, so they are real possibilities *greatly* exaggerated for the sake of creating a quality horror film, but when you stop and really think about it, the Final Destination series could really mess with your head, and perhaps even permanently screw up your mental state.      That is, if you choose to take it seriously and believe in this kind of stuff.  You know, believing the death of every single person on the face of the planet is meant to happen for a reason, and we're all just ticking clocks waiting to die.  For someone like me, it's hard *not* to take a film like this somewhat seriously.  Death is just unbelievably fascinating to me, and this interpretation of it makes it even more exciting.    After all, the way people die in this film involve cars, fires, heavy objects falling on top of people and crushing them, and several other realistic possibilities.  It's hard for me NOT to think some of this stuff is actually entirely likely to happen.    Of course, the odds of a domino effect coming together and forming the perfect strategy to eliminate a human being is EXTREMELY unlikely to actually happen, but well... sometimes in real life, only a couple things have to come together in order to take out a person.  With *this* in mind, now you know why I find this series a bit freakier than other horror films.  It's exaggerated, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility.      The movie writers who come up with the storylines for these kind of films must be exceptionally smart and clever.  They must sit there and actually think up the most bizarre and creative ways that a person can die.  Like I said above- these creative and incredibly graphic deaths are highly unlikely to happen in reality, but the fact so much attention to detail was given makes me really think the movie writers have a special talent for these specific kind of horror films.      Anyway, another aspect of the Final Destination series that gives me a distinctly cold chill is whenever a death is about to happen, and you see a black shadow forming around the area or object that will eventually play a major role in killing a person.  It happens very briefly before the shadow fades away (along with a creepy sound effect to indicate it's there) but it's a special attention to detail that I REALLY like.  Good job to the movie writers for including it.  It actually makes me wonder if similar kinds of shadows can be seen in real life as a warning sign right before someone dies.  You never know.    Anyway, what makes THIS Final Destination even better than previous ones is the fact that there's a *lot* of death scenes this time around.  Not only that, but the death scenes you witness this time around are EXTREMELY graphic, bloody and disgusting.  I sure hope you have a strong enough stomach to handle it!  They lay it on really thick and heavy for this one.    Overall, yes.  Death is freaky.  Believing everything happens for a reason and certain people are meant to die is a *very* dangerous line of thinking (believe me, I've thought about it hard and heavy for several years now, and it's NOT healthy).  But do yourself a favor and check out a really superb way to handle the horror genre in the Final Destination series.  It's mind-bogglingly creative and just terrific.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|That's a real American Western. Not spaghetti in the least and not parading &agrave; la John Wayne in the even slightest least. Real tough, dirty, hateful. Two lazy and absolutely zilch young men who do not want to do anything, learn anything, even swimming, and yet want the money other people are making so that they both with their common lady love can have high life on the frontier. Just marginal and incompetent young men who do not have any sense of time, of the past and the future, of what was possible before and what is leading to no future, but who cares about the future since we have good money, good food, good wine and good bourbon right now. Tomorrow is another day and we have to spend the night somewhere before we reach that tomorrow. And they don`t learn. First they do not see that trains are finished and that train companies are going to set up the real tracking teams they need to capture them, dead if possible. When they finally realize trains are out just like banks are finished, they go to New York and board a boat to Bolivia. And there they discover banks are not paying, local bandits are both more numerous, better organized and tolerated, but also not quite fast enough for two Yankee outlaws. But they also will find out that no one is going to close their eyes and they will report everything. They won't wait or be afraid. Let's tell the local police that is quite plentiful, and they will in their turn call the cavalry and then dying will no longer be an option. It will be the only bottleneck way out, shot by hundred of bullets and not two or three. Beautiful film that tries to give the real smell and feel of the frontier in those days, dirty, smelly, dusty, potent with filth and total lack of courage, but economically enterprising and trusting the best trackers and the best professional shooters to do the job. Posses and vigilantes were out now in the time of railroads and steam engines, and industry and two digit growth rates. The sentimental and psychological side is maybe not as rich as in the spaghetti westerns, but the film is effective to make you be relieved from any fear that such a past could come back. It is gone and good riddance. And what if we were confronted to that kind of gangsterism again in our suburban sprawl? Then I guess we would have to call the cavalry in again.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDogical side is maybe not as rich as in the spaghetti westerns, but the film is effective to make you be relieved from any fear that such a past could come back.

B002ZG9846|4.0|Kick Ass concerns young Dave Lizewski (played wonderfully by Aaron Johnson) who wonders - why aren't there any super heroes?  Despite his friends' advice that anyone who tried would be killed in a day he tries and is promptly almost killed.  Several steel plates and a higher tolerance for pain (due to damaged nerves) later and he's at it again.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie full of wit and charm but also full of violence and is not for the squeamish.  Buying himself a super hero-ish suit from eBay Dave eventually make a splash fighting off some thugs and getting posted on YouTube.  Before long he's unintentionally running afoul of organized crime and other superheroes alike.  Additionally he's having trouble wooing the girl he likes since she mistakenly thinks he's gay due to a rumor that started after his accident.<br /><br />Those other superheroes come in the form of Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).  Big Daddy is a wronged man with a grudge and Hit Girl is his 11 or 12 year old daughter he's trained in weapons, martial arts and the art of killing.  This most likely is why a big studio would not pick this project up (their loss) and what may put some people off.  But let me tell you ALL the best action scene in this move involve Hit Girl kicking butt and taking names.  She easily and literally slices through gang members and gangsters with glee.  There's something about her though, a sweetness and an eagerness to please her dad that makes you like her.<br /><br />The local crime boss takes exception to all the super hero-ing going on and his son (Christopher \\"McLovin\\" Mintz-Plasse) hatches a plan to lure in Kick Ass.  Bad things ensue all leading up to one of the more satisfying finales I've seen in a super hero flick in a while.  And in the end we get a bittersweet yet triumphant ending.<br /><br />Here are some downsides I saw.  It seemed like the injuries received by Kick Ass early on were almost magically healed.  He took pretty horrific injuries and based on the x-ray we are shown of his metal plates he should at least have some wicked scars but that's not the case.  Subsequent beatings yield similar results.  I know it's an action film so some of that should be expected but there it is.  Also the gay subplot seemed to be too easily and quickly wrapped up - one short scene and, bam, it was resolved.  CGI blood is way too obvious.<br /><br />But there is so much good.  This movie has heart and is not just a dumb action movie.  In spots it can make you laugh or cry, it can make you cringe or cheer, it can surprise you and scare you and it can make you think and be wowed.  The various elements of the movie gel together to make a very satisfying whole.  You do care about the characters and all the actors involved do a great job as well.  It's a well rounded movie.  Again though, a warning, this is not for kids.  If you are squeamish and don't like violence or language this is not for you.  It's not as uber violent as it sounds but there are scenes that can make you cringe.  If they'd not gone with the CGI blood in a lot of cases it may have genuinely been gory at times.  Put that aside and for me you have a 4 to 4 ½ star film.y we are shown of his metal plates he should at least have some wicked scars but that's not the case.

Also the gay subplot seemed to be too easily and quickly wrapped up - one short scene and, bam, it was resolved.  CGI blood is way too obvious.    But there is so much good.  This movie has heart and is not just a dumb action movie.  In spots it can make you laugh or cry, it can make you cringe or cheer, it can surprise you and scare you and it can make you think and be wowed.  The various elements of the movie gel together to make a very satisfying whole.  You do care about the characters and all the actors involved do a great job as well.  It's a well rounded movie.  Again though, a warning, this is not for kids.  If you are squeamish and don't like violence or language this is not for you.  It's not as uber violent as it sounds but there are scenes that can make you cringe.  If they'd not gone with the CGI blood in a lot of cases it may have genuinely been gory at times.  Put that aside and for me you have a 4 to 4 ½ star film.
0230700101|3.0|Not what I thought it would be.  rather draggy and boring.   would not recommend to friends.
030745455X|5.0|I have yet to read this trilogy, but my husband couldn't put it down and is begging me to read it so we can talk about it!  He also needed to get the next book as soon as he was done with this one!  Definitely addicting, and we can't wait to watch the movies!
B00008YNHD|1.0|Even tho I requested this title from NJ for my area, it was shipped from the UK and I cannot play it.  Had to pay to send it back.  Second time.  Think I'll forget it.
0307474712|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  This book actually made me both laugh out loud & sob out loud.  That's a good indication of how well an author can get his reader involved & care about the story.

0812979656|5.0|If that doesn't sound appealing to you, this book probably won't be. I've read a number of both the positive and negative reviews on this site and most of them describe the book accurately: Flowery prose, fragmented sentences, non-linear treatment of time, unusual metaphors. If you want to read a book for \\"information\\" (as some negative reviewers have implied that they do), then you should read Hemingway instead.<br /><br />That said, I could hardly put this book down. I almost reread it as soon as I was finished. The author creates a unique new language and lens through which to view the world. While others found the metaphors forced, I found them wonderfully colorful and original and appreciated the opportunity to hear a story told in words I wouldn't have come up with in my own head. I usually prefer more lighthearted stories (when I read fiction at all), but this tragedy is possibly my favorite book I've ever read.<br /><br />I would summarize by saying that this is a truly great work of literature that definitely has its own distinct character. Readers who enjoy magical realism will probably enjoy it. Readers who prefer a more straightforward or literal read, or who are bothered by solecisms or other violation of literary convention, probably will not. Different strokes.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|My first introduction to Diana Krall was the All for You album, covering some of the older Nat King Cole songs.  I was fairly impressed.  Enjoyable if somewhat mannered singing and decent piano chops.  Unfortunately stardom seemed to lead to increasingly commercial outcomes.  And while you can say the same for Nat King Cole as well (his diminished playing was a true loss), the talent and end results are not comparable.  Nat's singing and stylings were peerless while Diana's is marginal.  When listening to her sing on this album I can't help but wonder if Diana was not physically well (although she looks fantastic on the cover).  And her playing which to me is the more compelling (if a bit mainstream) part of her talents, has just about disappeared here as well.  As another reviewer mentioned, I thought Bacharach's Walk on By and and How Can You Mend A Broken Heart were among the few that I enjoyed at all.  It was a shame as I really liked the song selection.
0756405890|5.0|I have read a lot of fantasy books, and I thought I was spoiled because I read George RR. Martin's series... I was wrong. This book connects you with the characters, which is very good. When the main character was traumatized I actually felt the emotion, which is a great effect for an author to bestow upon his readers. I really like the variety in this book, and you will see what I mean when you read it. It really has the best of it all, from desolate wood lands, to huge cities. I have read some reviews that say this book is a bit long, and I can't agree because I didn't even notice the length. The reason being that I didn't notice the length was because I was so enticed with the book that I couldn't notice it. So please, do yourself a favor, and just give this book a try. I believe you will love this book, and if I am wrong, I at least hope that you enjoy it as half as much as I did, because that would still be a lot.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|The book is great! But I am peeved because it is a DRM! DRM is bad, you have no control over the book. Please tell the Kindle people to post when it is a DRM! I'm buying from the Sony Reader store on this one!
0060899220|4.0|While I only may have worked for four years in a small town restaurant, I maintain it was the best job I ever had.  Being obsessed with food today and remembering that love I had for that job, I was easily drawn to this book.  It tells the story of a man, an everyman, that worked his way and isn't afraid to share the rungs of the ladder.<br />  Entertaining through and through this read not only gave me a smile and a chuckle, but taught me a few things too.  Even if you were a dish washer for a summer in high school, buy this book.  It brought back wonderful memories and was full of excitement.  I genuinely enjoyed it a lot, as I am sure anyone else will that has the interest to read the reviews.
1434102815|5.0|This is the classic book on how to write.  If you've already read it, you don't need me to tell you how good it is.  If you haven't, then stop reading this review and go get it--either online for free or in an inexpensive paper version.  I'll just suggest three books to back it up on your shelf.  Strunk and White is the best by far, but these will help you, too.<br /><br />Kilian Crawford's [[ASIN:1551808315 Writing for the Web]] provides guidance and examples for successful online writing.  Web readers have different expectations and attention spans and it takes different techniques to capture, hold and develop their interest in your message.<br /><br />Roy Peter Clark's [[ASIN:0316014990 Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer]] provides strategy advice that ranges from \\"Nuts and Bolts\\" like \\"Begin sentences with subjects and verbs\\" to \\"Useful Habits\\" such as \\"Turn procrastination into rehearsal.\\"<br /><br />Mark Kramer and Wendy Call's [[ASIN:0452287553 Telling True Stories: A Nonfiction Writers' Guide]] contains advice from experienced writers and editors on a range of topics.  The short chapter format makes it perfect for opportunistic reading by busy writers.<br /><br />Who am I to make these recommendations?  Some great writer, maybe?  Nope.  I'm a so-so writer who enjoys it, wants to be better at it, and needs all the help he can get.  And I've read each of these books and learned something.  My guess is that you will, too.<br /><br />Feed your shelf and it will be there for you.
1442300051|3.0|The guy that reads the book on the audio cd is impossible to listen to.  It sounds like he has macaroni and cheeese in his mouth! That is my only way to describe it.  It is gross.  Pretty good book though.
020161622X|5.0|The authors offer solid advice on practical matters in software development. This book makes a good addition to the bookshelf on best practices.  In the form of essays, the authors cover what tools should a strong software engineers posses, and how one should use them to their full potential. They also discuss programming constructs to solve traditional programming challenges- error handling, code reuse, debugging, etc. They also offer their thoughts on how to apply concepts, such as de-duplication, not only on the code level, but also overall in the development process, such as documentation management.  The book is a well synthesized form of their experience and manages to stay involved and dynamic.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|There is never idle time in this board game, and it requires thought and strategy. After you play one game, you'll be ready for another.  It only takes 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete, so people won't have time to get bored.  Excellent game.
030745455X|4.0|I read this book for my book club and really enjoyed it.  It was a nicely woven tale of suspense that is hard to come by in a lot of books! The author did a great job of giving nothing away, so you were engaged the entire time.  And, each new mystery was as surprising as the one before.
B002ZG9788|1.0|This movie is a complete waste of time, money, Blu-ray media and normally excellent actors.  I expected a storyline similar to the 1981 original, which followed the mythology fairly closely, replacing the Ray Harryhausen stop-action characters with updated CGI.  Instead I was presented with this mess:  an incoherent script that mangled the mythology, truly bad performances  from well-respected actors, and absolutely ho-hum effects, not to mention the bizarre scenery--since when is there a vast desert in Greece?  I admit that the 1981 original was really cheesy and campy but it was FUN.  The people responsible for this travesty sucked all the joy out of what could have been a great summer movie, turning it into what appears to be an Army recruiting film.    Speaking of which, what was up with Sam Worthington's anachronistic look in this film: a buzz cut and an Army green t-shirt with a pleated skirt?  (At least it wasn't camo.)  Since every other man in the film had long hair and wore (mostly) white, I can only assume it was to keep him from fading into the background.  It seems clear that at least the costuming department realized that he has neither the look nor the acting chops to carry a movie, even a summer popcorn one, and decided to help him by making him look like a time traveling escapee from ROTC class at an all-girls school.    Now we come to Ralph Fiennes, whose entries as Hades forcibly reminded me of Pigpen from the Peanuts comics.  His accent was odd and unpredictable and he chewed scenery like he hadn't had a good meal in weeks.  (If he wants to play a villain, he should stick to Voldemort where he can at least keep his normal British accent.)  And Liam Neeson playing a hippie Zeus, sometimes masquerading as Obi Wan Kenobi...what was that all about?  Where were the lightning bolts...the arrogance..the absolute power?  Why weren't these actors and the director and the scriptwriters forced to read the mythology behind this story before making this film?Why wasn't the Kraken released on them?    There is much more (all bad) I could say about this movie, from the filmmakers' \\"borrowing\\" of iconic images from much better films to the dialogue which would have been more appropriate for Rambo, but as my momma always said, \\"No point in beating a dead horse.\\"  In short (I know, too late), I hated this movie and want my $25 back.
0439023483|5.0|My cousin recommended this book and I was sceptical because it sounded a bit brutal and sci-fi for what I usually like but IT WAS AMAZING! It is so well written, on the edge of your seat, page turner, all the typical one liners you would hear of something everyone seems to like!  I couldn't wait to finish so I could start Catching Fire, the second book in the thrilling story, but I found myself putting off finishing that one because I just didn't want it to end and I know that the third book isn't out for a few  weeks yet.  I finally had no choice but to finish the second book and now I have to wait for the third to come out.  I think I will re-read (or just zip through) both the first and second books again quickly right before I read the third just so it all can be like a movie seen at once!
B000W93CXQ|5.0|\\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" was definitely NOT something I would normally read as an adult. However, a high school student had mentioned that it was the best book she has ever read....so I thought I would give it a shot. I was definitely NOT disappointed. The book was very compelling and I could not stop reading it. However, I do agree with some of the more critcal reviews in that I found myself feeling more pity for the people who received the audio tapes than Hannah Baker herself.     I would recommend this book for any pre-teen or teen. It would help them to understand how their words or actions can affect someone else in such a horrible way. For adults, I think I would steer clear of this book....
B001MEJY8W|2.0|I'm not particularly impressed with the current wave of French horror films:  High Tension holds up pretty well, but Frontier(s) and Inside are merely revolting, and Martyrs is a very mixed bag.      Its first hour is quite unnerving and skillfully told, in part because you suspect that more's going on than you're being led to believe.  Unfortunately, when that \\"more\\" finally hits, it's not terribly satisfying.  The thing that makes non-supernatural horror movies work is the possibility, even if it's outrageous, that the situation on screen could really happen in the real world.  For example, Hostel accomplishes this trick pretty well, while The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a masterpiece in that regard.  The scenario presented by Martyrs, however, is simply implausible.  If the movie can't make you believe that such a thing could really happen, then the movie has lost you.  If the movie's group of torturers/psychopaths/whatever-they-are had been Islamic fundamentalists, I might have bought it.  But a bunch of BMW drivers who act like they're living in the Middle Ages ain't gonna work.    Another issue: the ending is so vague that I honestly couldn't decide if (1) the filmmaker intended to leave it up to the audience's interpretation or (2) he simply couldn't figure out how to end it.  I suspect the latter.
0307454541|5.0|This book was even better than the first in the trilogy! It was a non-stop mystery with leads that kept you wanting to read more. I read the book whenever and where ever I could and still couldn't get to the end fast enough.  The main character is so interesting and so well developed, that you just have to like her style! One of the best mysteries I've read in a long time; and, I read mysteries all the time!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I love this video... the workouts are great. My only problem with it is that the you cannot go directly to the menu once the video starts. Each time you begin the dvd you must go through Jillian talking. I'm a busy Mom trying to fit in a workout and the minute or two that you can jump right into the workout sometimes makes a difference. Other than that I love the workout and I would still have purchased knowing that I couldn't skip straight through to it!
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|The materials are very nice and the design is good. I want to report the internal measurements of mine, which seem at variance with others: 5 x 3 x 1.5\\". It is a perfect fit for my Kodak Z915. The outside pocket hidden by the top flap is 4.5 x 3.3\\" with a nice zipper near the top and an expansion gusset on the left side. (My Duracell PPS2 Li instant charger which is a small external USB battery, fits nicely in there with its cable, although it is not an accessory that I would use with that particular camera.)<br /><br />The function and padding of this bag are excellent and a very good buy at this price point. The only downside is poor worksmanship in sewing: on mine neither the belt loop nor the flap velcro strip are centered. Neither flaw is going to make any difference in the use of the bag.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an awesome book, I can't wait to read the 2nd.  The story was very well written and I liked the world that Suzanne Collins created.
B0002DB52M|1.0|For at least the first 90 minutes (all I was able to stand), the actors are virtually emotionless.  In fact, I thought they must be on drugs.  Consequently, a narrator has to explain everything because you otherwise can't tell from the sedated performances.  The Tom character incessantly grows more and more insipid and annoying.  Even the kid is an annoying jerk, just wanting to be spanked by Grace, obviously because he gets a charge out of it...<br /><br />So, by the time the rape scene started I figured it was time to move on and skipped through to the end.  I could see where it was going and frankly, had no interest in plodding any further along with it.  As a fable, allegory or metaphor, it merely ended up disconnected, unrealistic, moralistic and preachy if anything at all, and ultimately, not very interesting or poignant.<br /><br />If this is what Von Trier really thinks of human nature, American or otherwise, I pity the poor fool.  If he's trying to make some kind of deep allegorical statement about anything, American imperialism, immigration, human nature, or whatever, the overly simplistic plot just falls on it's face.  I don't care if he's been to America or not, he's simply a lousy storyteller here.  Sophomoric and pointless.<br /><br />Aptly named though, the movie IS truly a dog.  To sum up (spoiler), it sets up a contrived situation where a bunch of vapid and unsympathetic characters start out sorta nice but for no good reason end up acting like complete jerks towards an outsider which is then used to justify blowing them away-- the end.  Ultimately, the outsider and her \\"dad\\" are just as vapid and unsympathetic as everyone else.  There, I just saved you three hours.
0749953357|4.0|Seth Godin has written a ton of good books.  Many have been about marketing related topics, more recently he has written on personal and professional development.  This book extends some of his previous work in some ways, yet I find it hard to categorize.  The book, as of this writing was in the Amazon top 100 in two categories - Job Hunting and Careers  and Self-Help/Success.  It could also be categorized as a leadership book, a marketing book and more.<br /><br />In part Seth is trying to describe a shift in the work of the world, how it is valued and what will make you most successful.  In part he is convincing you in a quite personal way how remarkable you can be and in part he is giving you suggestions and ideas to help you move in that direction.<br /><br />His points are made with stories, research and simple examples.  He challenges you to think, he asks his readers tough questions.<br /><br />I particularly like the chapter on Resistance.  I feel it is worth the investment in the book in and of itself.  I know I will read it again (likely before you read these words).<br /><br />Seth's writing style is easy and fun to read, and if you are fan you will definitely want to read this book.  If you haven't read Seth before (you can always start at his blog), pick this book if the topic and my comments resonate with you.  It isn't his shortest book, and depending on your perspective, maybe not his best, but it provides valuable insights and challenge you to think about your career, your talents, your choices and yourself in new ways.
0061998494|5.0|Fantastic!  Honest, open, funny, and straight forward.  Excellent reading I couldn't put it down.

0385528752|4.0|The front cover of this book proclaims an important marketing message \\"The best selling authors of Made to Stick\\"  I'm guessing you have at least heard of Made to Stick and perhaps read it.  If not, I highly recommend it).<br /><br />In this book the Heath brothers examine, attack and illuminate the concepts of change.  In their informative and fun to read style they both remind of us change concepts we did know, and provide us insight into things we may not have known.<br /><br />Readers of Made to Stick will recognize the writing style that is designed to not only be read and enjoyed but remembered.  Utilizing many of their own lessons the authors provide great ideas, backed by research and examples and package all of it in a way that is meaningful and memorable.<br /><br />If you are a leader dealing with change (which is all of us), want to affect change in some group or yourself, or just want to understand change better for yourself, I highly recommend this book.  I have more notes and ideas written in this book than in any I've read in several months.  You will take practical ideas, you will see the world in new ways and you will enjoy the read.<br /><br />Made to Stick was a great book, and this might even be better.  Until they prove me otherwise, anything by Chip and Dan Heath is a must read.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|They blew it.  They didn't even try and for that I hope the sales of this DVD set tank.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I searched and delayed buying a headset for what amounts to an eternity to today's facebook/twitter generation.  Reviews and price of headsets were mixed and confusing.  After much research I decided on Turtle Beaches and found the Ear Force PX21 on sale one day.  The crazy thing is for one of the rare times in life; something I ordered on-line not only met my expectations, but exceeded them greatly.     Positives:    1.  Size and comfort:  I have a huge noggin (size 18 cap minimum) Yeah, check out the big brains on me.  Ear Force 21 fit and is still comfortable in the middle of one of my 8 hour gaming sessions.    2.  Quality:  My fear was the headsets would be dainty and fragile.  Not good for my pudgy fingers and bull in the china shop mentality, especially when it comes to my rare free time from the wife and kids.  This is where the product really shines.  The Ear Force PX21 is a well built piece of art.  Beautiful and sturdy.    3.  Control layout:  I was really worried about having a live mic around and my wife coming downstairs to berate me for some responsibility that Call of Duty got in the way of, but the controls allow me to easily switch the mic on and off.  Also, you can turn game volume and chat volume up and down independently which helps when the junior high kids are yakking in their high pitched shrills or when you want to turn game volume up to track opponents foot steps while you camp.    Negative:    1.  Sound:  I'm being picky here, but the sound isn't as good as the high quality surround sound I like to play on.  I have thousands of dollars invested in my system though, so it should be better.  Unfortunately, since most of my game time comes late at night with kids sleeping, I can't always crank it up to a level that allows me to enjoy and take advantage of my system; therefore the headsets are a quality substitute even if it isn't pristine.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan for a while, but just bought the album after seeing the Broadway show in NYC. It's fascinating how the \\"messages\\" resonate with people across generations. I teach English to adult immigrants and even played a couple of songs and gave the lyrics to LONELY ROAD and WHATSERNAME to an advanced class. Whatersername was sort of a cultural curiosity to most of them, but Lonely Road resonated with the experiences of many. More proof of music as a universal and - sometimes - unifying language.

1603425381|5.0|I loved this book from the first opening. It is very beautifully presented and have pictures for every border. The instructions are both written and as a chart. It was so hard to pick the one I wanted to use first. I would definitely recommend this is you love finishing off your crochet projects with beautiful borders.
0143118420|5.0|I loved this book.  I also listened to the Book on CD, read by Elizabeth Gilbert, the author.  It was wonderful hearing the book as it was intended by the writer.  This book is a journey to another life, a life focused on bliss, solitude and compassion.  Beautifully written!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I've been searching for \\"15 Step\\" for a long time.  Luckily, Direct TV showed a studio Session for In Rainbows & I knew this was THE Radio Head CD for me.  It's got some really great, haunting songs & I can't get enouogh of it!
B002ZG97E2|5.0|Not just for kids, this film entertains from its characters' voices to the cutesy yellow, boppy things. There are \\"maturer\\" humor elements for adults that will conveniently be over the heads of youngsters (as were in Shrek). I usually don't see animated films and was surprised how engaged I was by this one.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|After seeing the trailer, I thought this movie was going to be Napoleon Dynamite with a cape, but wow was I wrong. Kick-Ass was excellent on every level.  Thrilling, funny, great acting and writing, wonderful characters.     My only complaint is that they should have called it \\"Hit Girl\\", because she absolutely steals the show.
0143038419|5.0|I'm about half-way through this one.  My best friend who lives in another state recommended EPL to me.  By recommended, I mean that we talk about once a week on the phone and our conversations turned into her reading me things that she thought I needed to hear from the book.  Consequently, when I broke down and bought the book, I now hear the narrative in Tiffany's adorable GA drawl, which I'm sure is not geographically accurate given the fact that Elizabeth Gilbert is from New York.  Minor details.      Anyway, it's not The Bible, but it's a heck of a good read, especially for those of us who are 31... and going through a divorce... and have a sense of humor.  I read all of the negative reviews and I just don't get it.  It's a book, if you think it's terribly boring, or don't like the fact that she makes a lot of money writing, or are upset that it doesn't hold the keys to unlock the universe... put it down.  Don't read it.  There are plenty of books that I get about two chapters into and decide not to go any further.  To date, no one has ever forced me to read a book since high school.    I think it's a great read.  It's light, humorous, and I don't have to think too hard or refer to another book to figure it out.  It makes me smile, and to me, that makes it worth reading.
0307594777|5.0|I'm not usually the type of reader who picks up a fast-paced thriller. Plus, I was a little skeptical about how good this series could really be after reading so many positive reviews. After almost finishing the third book, I'd have to say that this series is highly addictive reading. I love Larsson's narrative and characters--he has fleshed out a highly unorthodox but ultimately likable heroine in Lisbeth Salander. I finished the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and waited about a day before I started The Girl who Played with Fire. Of course anyone who has read the entire series knows that once you finish the second book, you immediately have to start reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I'm 2/3rds of the way through the third book now and am already starting to have withdrawal pains at the thought of ending this series.  Wonderful read, engaging characters, and a hell of a plot.  I definitely advise buying the set.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|The show:  Lost is one of those shows that re-defined what television is supposed to be. To put it simply, this show is one of the deepest, most well-written programs with fascinating 3-dimensional characters who grow and change in such immense ways and an immensely interesting mythology which, although not explained fully, is still explained quite thoroughly and in the end leaves less than 20% of the mysteries presented (which depending on the viewer's personal perception, range from inane and unimportant to very important) unsolved (or at least not solved directly). For anyone who hasn't already viewed the entire series, know that your overall satisfaction will ultimately be determined by whether you care more about the mysteries (most of which do get answered, though some are less direct than others) or whether you care more about the characters and their journeys on the island. Either way, this show is one you really have to watch all the way through for yourself (as there are viewers, particularly in the 1-star reviews, who were disappointed with the final season and the end of the show) to determine whether or not you want to shell out the cash for a complete collection.    (In case you're wondering where I get the \\"less than 20% unsolved\\" figure, one person went through the entire series multiple times and wrote down every single question asked and gave detailed answers to any of the questions answered as presented by the show and other \\"canonical\\" pieces, while equally showing which questions were not answered. LOST, in total, had 663 total mysteries, 536 answered mysteries, and 127 unanswered mysteries. Here's the link for those who have seen the series and want concrete results:[...]).    The collection itself:   I pre-ordered the BD collection and JUST received it in the mail yesterday. The Blu-Ray collection is far superior in terms of picture (especially for such a lush setting as Hawaii, where the show was filmed, is) and sound compared to the DVD standard definition. Disney (the parent company of ABC), as with anything else they put out on BD, has done an absolutely excellent job making this show look gorgeous and give HDTVs a run for their money. The only real downside comes with the earlier seasons (which were released on BD around the same time as the third season, as the technology wasn't being used prior to that) in which some of the special features (including the episodes with commentaries) are still in standard definition. Of course, seeing the SD commentary episodes after watching the HD episodes makes it really clear how much better the HD versions look.    Now I was originally not all that thrilled about all of the extra stuff (as I mostly just wanted the show itself), but now I can gladly say that the extras are worthwhile. The overall box is solid with great design. The Senet game (which does not come with rules, as there is some debate about what the ACTUAL rules are, but you can find the supposed rules online easily) is interesting/fun. There are Easter eggs throughout the box, including one particular thing that is only visible with a black light (which is provided), a page from the Black Rock journal (revealing the answer to another mystery), and a hidden bonus disk that you can find using the note from Jacob inside the Ankh and the black light (I won't divulge how to find it as it's more fun to figure it out on your own).    The only minor annoyances (and believe me, they are minor) are that (1) Senet doesn't come with any rules (although as explained above, it's because no one knows the rules for sure, but the supposed rules can be found online easily enough) and (2) the cases for the disks are too tall to fit on a standard DVD shelf. Of course, the cases are really nice looking (with artwork and such from the corresponding season) and solid, so that pretty much makes up for that minor inconvenience.    Overall, this set is worth the $195 Amazon is charging. If you are already a Lost fan, do not already have the BD versions of the seasons (and actually have a Blu-Ray player/PS3), and have the money, it's worth it. If you already own the seasons on BD or can't afford this right now, it's worth waiting for. But once again, DON'T BUY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE WHOLE SERIES! Watch it first and THEN decide.    (Is this better, Earnest?)

0312944926|5.0|I wasnt familiar with this book until a friend suggested I read it after I had already read other Dan Brown books.  I can say that it is adequate so far and meets my expectations but Im not overly impressed since I contrast the davinci code and angels and demons to this book.  The latter are much more intellectually stimulating if that is what you are looking for.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|In terms of graphcis alone, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  When I first saw it, I figured most of it was CGI, but then I watched the making -of featurettes and was startled to find that many of the creatures were actually in costume.  You don't see too much of that these days.  The atmosphere of Silent Hill was perfectly captured in the gloomy sky, falling ashes and decrepit buildings.    Where I got hung up was the plot.  I've never played the Silent Hill game series, so I don't know if that would help me or not, but at the end I literally just sat there and asked myself: \\"What just happened here?\\" And found I had absolutely no idea.  Here are just  a few questions that were raised in my mind: Are all the residents of Silent Hill dead (like, is that why Rose says they're \\"already damned?\\") and just think they're some sort of super-cult that survived the apocalypse?  Is Alessa dead, and if she is, how did she give birth -- and why at the particular time she did, YEARS after she was burned, from the timeline I could gather? Is Sharon more of a \\"spirit-child,\\" an entity, or some sort of copy, of her \\"mother?\\" Who is the creepy demon child and why does she look like Sharon? What's up with the barbed wire in Alessa's \\"revenge\\" sequence? Where did all the weird creatures come from and what do they have to do with anything, other than scaring the principal actors? Do Sharon and Rose die at the end of the movie?  What's Dahlia supposed to do, all alone back at Silent Hill? Also, another reviewer mentioned a disease that Sharon is dying from: How did I miss that? What is this weird disease? All I saw was a sleepwalking child...    You know, I really have no clue.  I enjoyed watching the film, but I emerged more confused than I went in, which isn't exactly the cathartic feeling I normally like to experience at the end of a viewing.  I do like the soundtrack, though.

0451205766|5.0|As much as I love Francis Ford Coppola's movie adaptation of this book as well as its sequel--let's not get into the misbegotten Godfather III--I've always felt that his vision was not exactly Puzo's.  Though set mainly in New York, the movies have  a northern Californian feel for me.  The Corleone compound is on Long Island, but it feels more like a Napa Valley vineyard.  Many of the settings lack the requisite East Coast grit, and the Mafiosi speak and behave with the gravitas of Borgia courtiers.  Don't get me wrong.  Godfather I and II are great films, but if you want to know how the real Mafia behaves, this is not prime source material.  (Scorsese's mobsters are more on the money.)  Puzo had a hand in the film version of his blockbuster, working on the screenplay with the director, and it's hard to imagine that he wouldn't have been pleased with the result.  But if you want to experience Don Corleone's saga with authentic  New York attitude, read the book.  Puzo managed to achieve Shakespearean drama without sacrificing  the reality of day-to-day life in organized crime.  The book is often passed over as a mere pot-boiler that was transformed into a great film, but Coppola undoubtedly recognized the elements of a grand story when he read the book.  If you've seen the films but haven't read the original, by all means do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.  You won't be disappointed.
1595825045|5.0|This art book provides and extensive behind-the-scenes look at the creative process involved in animating Avatar: The Last Airbender. At nearly 200 pages in length, it details the origin of the story, some of the animation process, character designs, storyboards, and even offers glimpses into the extra details we don't always appreciate just by watching the cartoon. The content is arranged and organized into different chapters according to the 3 Books (or seasons) of the series, in addition to a chapter on \\"extra\\" design art work and fun sketches the animators produced over the years. This is a relatively easy book to read and it's extremely fun to look at, so it's appropriate for both older and younger fans. Although the price tag is a little hefty, this accounts for the high-quality pages and the size of the book itself. For huge fans of the series (like myself), the price is worth it!
B000Y7U98W|4.0|Think \\"Heart of Darkness\\" in space.  And, instead of 'Darkness,' brightness is the ironic twist.    The film takes some surreal turns, and the biggest mistake a viewer could make would be to cling to disbelief or nitpick away at the 'science' of it all.  The cast is a solid collection of familiar faces, and the film sends them off into themes of heroism, sacrifice, and desperation.  Visual effects are great, and we have a classic soundtrack here that has since shown up in any number of other films, trailers, TV shows, etc.    The Blu-ray presentation looks and sounds great.  Extras are satisfying.  If you enjoy the film, you can't go wrong with a Blu-ray copy.  If you are unsure of a 'blind buy,' definitely rent first.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I got these a couple of days ago. I upgraded from a pair of Ultrasone HFI-780 to these. It was the best thing I every did. Every thing is so much better on these headphones then the less. I still haven't burned these in which I do while I enjoy them. The most important is that these headphones req to be amped to sound correctly. a Standalone headphone amp/Dac or a sound card with a amp on it will amp these headphones.    When they are not amped they will not sound right and not sound the way they should. After burned in the headphones will sound even better, I think it req around 200-300 hours of use to open up but dont quote me on that.    I use these headphones for my Music, Gaming and movies and it works wanders in them all.They have perfect bass, not that heavy bass like the HFI-780 had which made me feel like I was in a club. I listen to Trance, techno,dance, electronic, even drum and bass, it did really good with these types of music. even classical, I heard sounds I never heard in my collection of sounds.Alot of detail that went missing I now hear.    In games the positional and sound stage was great, played a couple of fps and it was much better then my last headphones when it came into positional and sound stage. I easy tell where people was coming up from. In movies Like the way movies now sound.

B000002GLT|4.0|Rating: 4.5 Stars<br />I am really pleased to see so many glowing reviews of this interesting and unique John Mayall album.  USA Union has stood the test of time with me as I still periodically pull this one out and when I do it generally stays in the rotation for weeks.  I enjoy the seamless and smooth flow of the tracks as they are propelled along by the steady and melodic bass lines of Larry Taylor.  Harvey Mandel's guitar contributions are fluid and under control without being overly restrained.  The same is true for Sugarcane Harris and his masterful work on the violin.  As for the compositions themselves, you get a sample of Mayall's  eco-hippie side (Nature's Disappearing), a peek into his domestic diary (Night Flyer, Off The Road, Possessive Emotions, Took The Car, My Pretty Girl, Deep Blue Sea),  his fun and funny side (Where Did My Legs Go), and a pair of well constructed numbers that range from slow blues (Crying) to up-tempo boogie (You Must Be Crazy).  In a word USA Union is \\"REFRESHING\\" and well worth giving a listen to.
0765348276|5.0|It was funny, serious, and adventurous. I enjoyed it immensely. I'm no warmonger but the opportunity to recapture youth certainly is inviting. It was very surprising that John Scalzi and Alister Reynolds both defined space travel as an elevator like device. I also found the concept of jumping from universe to universe reminiscent of Jodie Foster's sci fi movie about space travel and the TV show \\"Fringe\\". It was a very good read.

0393324818|5.0|I was never a fan of baseball for many reasons. One reason that hit me hard at a young age was the lack of a salary cap. This made me feel like winning could be bought with millions of dollars. Thankfully the teams with the most money also had the most archaic way of interpreting how to build an efficient baseball team. The teams that took a scientific approach to building a winning team while also abandoning the traditional scouting techniques began winning. Voilà, moneyball is created.  The best part of this book is not how the teams with less money reinvented the game, it's how the insiders of baseball openly deny fact, science, and the possibility that they could be wrong without even blinking. These people are so afraid of losing their jobs to number-crunching nerds they won't even try to understand this alternative approach because they are getting paid for being ignorant. Therefore If they allowed the approach to become accepted they would be quickly cycled out for people who could pick teams from stats instead of sheer \\"gut feelings\\". True underdog story of intellect being able to compete with dumb money. Like usual, Lewis writes this book like a well told story while also documenting endless amounts of facts to strengthen his arguments.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|One of the best movies of all time! The quality of the blu-ray was flawless. However the digital copy was more of a dvd quality copy. Not too sure if I prefer the mask over the regular packaging though. But definitely a good way for WB to market the product to the fans!
0545123283|4.0|Just when Sam and Grace are settling into the happiness of Sam as full-time human, Grace begins succumbing to the wolf bite she suffered as a small child. This on top of the stress of Sam as the human leader of a pack he can no longer run with, including several new wolves (remember the ones who Beck brought that supposedly \\"chose\\") and Grace's friend, Olivia. Of course, add to this the stress of Isabel's vigilante dad and the police investigation into Olivia's sudden disappearance. &lt;sigh><br /><br />This book is all about tearing down the happy ending of Shiver, and seeing Sam's vulnerabilities pulled raw and naked for everyone to see. It's painful and difficult to read, which means Stiefvater has forced us to read the final book hoping for some resolution.<br /><br />Isabel and Sam take larger roles in this book and the narrative is split between Isabel's, Sam's, Grace's, and Cole's (new wolf) points of view. If you recall in Shiver, the POV were between Grace and Cole and tracked the temp. No temp here, but make sure you read whose POV it is, as this at times is VERY confusing.<br /><br />Stiefvater appears to have listened to reviewers of Shiver and has taken pains to wake up Grace's parents. Expect more parental concern and involvement in Linger, as well as clarification of physical relationships. This does bring this book back to a level more appropriate for YA with less parental red flags.<br /><br />Overall, I think Shiver was a FAR more compelling book. Furthermore, Linger feels a bit disjointed from Shiver, especially with a couple plot discrepancies that are a bit frustrating. Cole is an interesting story, but the split plot at times makes the book feel torn in too many directions.<br /><br />Bottom line: Linger is not as compelling as Shiver but good in its own right. Personally, I feel Stiefvater's faerie books [[ASIN:0738713708 Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception]] and [[ASIN:0738713708 Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception]] are better.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I first saw 'Fawlty Towers' when I was about 14 and every episode had me in stitches. I can still watch it today 25 years later, and titter at the gags I have seen so many time before. Each episode has people running around like in a French farce, but the main source of amusement has to come from Basil Fawlty, uniquely portrayed by the talented John Cleese. That is not to say that the other actors and actresses were not brilliant, for they all were! It all worked to create seemless and hilarious comedy. 'Fawlty Towers' never had the chance to go stale as only two series were made, that is 12 episodes in all. It never ages, although you do need to put yourself back in time a bit to understwnd what's going on with the mad major. See this series at least once in your life!

6305428298|5.0|Vulgar, hilarious, surreal and sad. Another addition to the 'Full Monty' and 'Brassed Off' genre that are such a delight to watch. 'Little Voice' tells the story of a girl who seemingly imprisons herself in her upstairs room with a collection of her father's records, and who is talent-spotted by a sleazy talent-scout who overhears her amazing vocal impressions of female singers. All this happens against the backdrop of the nitty-gritty of a Yorkshire seaside town. Comedy through sadness; laughter through tears. Fantastic performance by the lovely Jane Horrocks as the sweet LV, and she did her own musical impressions, which were passable, but not perfect. But that doesn't matter, as it isn't really the point. If you liked 'Brassed Off' and 'The Full Monty' you'll love this! get it!
0316010669|5.0|I have just re-read this.  It first came out in 2005 and I probably read it about then.  Of course, I'd forgotten a lot of the detail.<br /><br />The main premise is that when we make decisions we already have a lot of information in our adaptive subconscious that means we often need very little time to make our decisions. Sometimes having too much information input does not improve our decision making - we can make decisions with very little information.  Sometimes our adaptive unconscious leads us to make racist and sexist decisions - despite our otherwise strongly held beliefs, but we can work around those.<br /><br />Easy to read - not full of jargon, but still thoughtful and thought provoking.  There is a longish section about Dr Paul Ekman and microexpressions - he is the inspiration for the main character int he TV show \\"Lie to Me\\".  I also enjoyed his discussion surrounding the Pepsi Challenge, new Coke, and taste tests.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about the book is the extended example - Gladwell takes one event/situation and teases it out so that the full implications/ramifications can be seen.  He then refers back to some of the conclusions throughout the book, thereby cementing your understanding.<br /><br />An easy to read book that will get you thinking and looking at the world and yourself in a different way.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Lasse Halstrom is one of my most beloved and admired directors of the world. Gifted of that unusual touch of genius, he is always worried for transmitting those values based on the fraternity, devotion and fervent loyalty.<br /><br />Based on real facts, the film concerns about a beautiful relationship between a faithful dog and his beloved owner.<br /><br />The film is so touching, captivating and engaging that it's impossible for anyone of us not  leaving from the hall without a teardrop in our faces.<br /><br />Watch it. It will remove your heart and shock your spirit.
0061205699|5.0|Here are a couple of quotes that appealed to me:<br />I never loved to read.  One does not love breathing.<br />A mob's always made up of people.<br /><br />Just some facts about the book -<br />  * Lee spent two and a half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird<br />  * the book was published on July 11, 1960; it was initially titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it to reflect a story that went beyond a character portrait<br />  * Dill is modelled on Truman Capote (then known as Truman Persons)<br /><br />In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was \\"to be...the Jane Austen of South Alabama\\".  Literary critic Jean Black lists the priorities shared by the two authors - \\"affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status\\".<br /><br />An absolute must read if only for the amazing courage and determination of the characters - Oh and the delightful humour!!!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Stephen Daldry made a charming and engaging movie with this personal portrait about a boy who was born to dance in the middle of a miner village in Durham.<br /><br />After the initial attempts, his steeled stubbornness will launch to capture the vital essence of his dreams against all the odds.<br /><br />Haunting, exciting and tender, the movie will catch you from start to finish. Superb cast and flawless script will make the full round to become it a legendary status as one of the most reminded cult movies of the nineties.<br /><br />By any circumstance, you should not miss it.
0307454541|3.0|The story starts when Mikael Blomkvist loses a libel court case. He published a story in his independent magazine, Millenium, based on information he believed to be true about a Swedish industrialist.<br /><br />The loss results in him leaving the magazine and being hired by Henrik Vanger, a powerful businessman, who wants him to find out what happened to his great-niece Harriet. Harriet disappeared without a trace forty years earlier.<br /><br />A parallel story is about the girl of the title - Lisbeth Salander - who is employed in a private investigation firm and is very good at what she does. She is thorough and dogged in her work. She is also a loner with a dark past; creative and intriguing and moral when others around her are not. I could see Pauley Perette (who plays Abby in NCIS) playing her on screen.<br /><br />Lisbeth and Mikael meet, of course, and together uncover the forty year old mystery.<br /><br />There is a lot of exposition in the book, and I must say I skimmed quite a bit. I was intrigued enough to finish it, and I did enjoy it, but I don't think I will be reading any more in the series. It's one of those books that I was happy I read because \\"everyone\\" is reading it and I like to decide for myself what I think.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|The 8th season is probably, the most reflexive, hot and dramatic of the whole saga, due it presents many tenets and aspects concerned with the leadership, decision making in which the invocated concepts of national defense and ethic are confronted through a solid script supported on a web of events that involve the signature of a Peace Agreement between an Islamic Republic, Russia and United States.<br /><br />Once more, Jack Bauer will have to make the dirty job when he is requested by the CTU to fix a brutal terrorist plan over the area of NYC. He has to leave aside once more the gentle invitation of his daughter to live with them in LA.<br /><br />And as you and me guess the things will not keep out of control when a sophisticated web of encountered interests of all sort, shake hands in this superb and overwhelming session.<br /><br />The plot, the cast, the locations, the frantic rhythm, the peerless edition and the excel special effects shake hands in this formidable saga.<br /><br />Special kudos go for Michael Madsen, an overlooked actor who deserves major attention for the new generation of filmmakers.<br /><br />We'll miss you Jack.
B001IF252C|1.0|This thing is a piece of garbage. My screen goes on and off (mostly off). No fixes from Apple or anyone else. AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!
B00008EYA5|4.0|Swat (special weapons and tactics) was for 2003 probably the hottest and most exciting film of that year. Samuel Jackson is in very good shape as well as Colin O' Farrell who leader the main tactic command in L.A.<br /><br />After several explosive sequences, the great end is about to come when a dangerous and requested thief once captured is sent to Federal Prison and twice he evades the legal fence.<br /><br />The astonishing sequences, underground chases and the climax sequence run for you, but over the years they have become a referential cult movie, and like the good wine has overcome the acidic test of time.<br /><br />Funny, exciting and entertained from start to finish. Kudos for Olivier Martinez as the French capo (Do you remember him in Unfaithful?).
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I love every single song here! Pink's vulnerability shines through on songs like \\"Sober\\" and \\"I Don't Believe You\\" and her rocker side comes across on other songs. Her voice is so controlled and so emotional. The pain of a breakup is evident, but the beat and musical arrangements are first class and fun to listen to. I've listened to this for a year and still love it.
1416550550|5.0|I really enjoyed Kate Morton's other book, House at Riverton,  so I chose Forgotten Garden as my summer-beach book.  It was engaging and entertaining.  Highly recommended
1892005034|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.I feel that young people (18 and under) should read this book as well, because I am currently 18.  It contains valuable information that is helpful for everyday life. I am currently trying to practice the NVC process, sometimes I forget but It is a nice book! I tell everyone, even my friends about the book, It makes you look at life a different way, instead of out for wants in life, it is all about your needs and other people. If all the people in the world have this book and practice, the world will be a BETTER place!!
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|I love the all of the star trek movies and am generally a huge fan of the entire saga.  However, one thing that I am really disappointed in is that when star trek the motion picture(the first of the original cast films) was on VHS, it was the special longer version aka the extended cut.  I have never heard of the extended cut or longer version of this film being available on dvd or blu ray yet.  In the double disc directors edition of the movie: all of the extra footage that was in the extended cut has been removed from the film and is found in the deleted scenes.  The same thing was done with another movie I loved called \\"the lawnmowerman\\" - extended cut on VHS and theatrical cut only on dvd.  Has anybody else noticed this and finds it annoying?  In my opinion, it is a sad state of affairs to release a lesser version of any film on dvd or blu ray when there has already been a superior  version of the movie on VHS.  So I am giving this set 4 out of 5 stars because of how awesome star trek truly is.  Live long and Prosper.

0440246008|1.0|I have always enjoyed reading all of the Lee Child, Reacher Series books, but I am upset that even Lee Child has had to weigh in politically in The Hard Way.  You may wonder what I am talking about.  It seems to me that this is a thinly veiled comment on the wars our country are fighting in the middle east.  Actually, it is a thinly veiled comment on any war we have fought since WW2.  I read books to escape the everyday media humdrum that is constantly trying to pound us into their political beliefs.  Now, even John Reacher is a liberal.  To me this did not need to be a part of this series.  One less series and writer to read.  Too bad.
0307474275|4.0|What can be said about The Da Vinci Code that hasn't already been said before? The book is one of the bestselling books of all time. The movie was equally popular. The story line, characters, and quality of Dan Brown's writing have been debated to death. The Da Vinci Code truly swept the world.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code has been criticized for being poorly written fluff. I just don't see it. The book isn't a hard read, but books don't have to be difficult to be considered good. The concept is intriguing and the adventurous mystery completely sucks you in. The pages fly as you unravel clues and learn a little history along the way.<br /><br />Obviously everything presented in The Da Vinci Code isn't entirely accurate. Historical or not, the book is still fiction. Not every portion of the mystery is going to be completely true, but there are some interesting educational facts to be found for those not well versed in secret societies or anything biblical.<br /><br />The bottom line is that The Da Vinci Code isn't perfect, but it is a fast-paced, engrossing historical mystery that can completely wow you if read with an open mind.
B003TZ9EGO|4.0|If you're a die-hard Lady Gaga fan, you'll probably want this disc for your collection, and if you're a casual fan, it's an inexpensive album to jam to on occasion, so why not buy it? That being said, though, it's definitely not a must-have.     The concept itself for a Gaga remix album is a good one, but I have no idea why these particular mixes were the ones chosen. There are FAR SUPERIOR remixes that were unfortunately left off, such as the Demolition Crew remix of \\"Paparazzi\\" and the Robots to Mars remix of \\"Lovegame.\\"     There are a few gems on here, however. The Stuart Price remix of \\"Paparazzi\\" is a good one as it features different studio vocals. Also, the Sound of Arrows remix of \\"Alejandro\\" is an interesting softer version of the original we all know and love. Not to mention, to my knowledge, the remixes of \\"Eh Eh,\\" \\"The Fame,\\" and \\"Dance in the Dark\\" have not been available in the U.S. before this release, which is a definite plus.     I was also disappointed in the packaging. There are no photographs at all in the booklet besides the cover, and there aren't any liner notes besides a re-listing of the tracks with their respective producers. It's somewhat shabby for a Gaga release, but you get what you pay for. All-in-all, this isn't really a disc that one would miss very much by not purchasing it, but it is still a good one to own for the few decent tracks that are on it.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I was blown away by this film which has a great cast of actors!  Leonardo DiCaprio (Cobb) has mastered the art of \\"architecting\\" dreams and pulling others into the dream.  Once in, he is able to gain the other person's secrets, as people are less cautious about guarding information in their dreams.     Throughout the film he has a goal of getting back to the United States to see his two children.  This may be impossible because he is somewhat responsible for the death of his wife (Mal).  He makes a deal with a powerful businessman (Saito) that if he can plant an idea for another businessman (Fisher) to break up his company, Saito will ensure that Cobb can pass through customs without a second look.    Cobb uses a team to accomplish this mission including Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Arthur) and Ellen Page (Ariadne).  Ariadne has exceptional talent and learns to see and architect dreams rapidly.   The team needs to bring Fisher through three levels of a dream to put the idea in his mind that his company needs to be broken up.    The movie goes on to explain that at each deeper level of dreaming time can pass very slowly (as much as decades in the lowest level) because the brain is so powerful, while very little time passes in the real world.  Cobb and his Mal had experienced and entire lifetime within a dream.  Mal seems to constantly be in Cobb's dreams and always wants to destroy the fabric of the dream.  Cobb carries a small top that he uses to let him know whether her is the dreamer or he has been brought into a dream created by Mal.    I highly enjoyed this film and found it so thought provoking.  The acting was first-rate and Ellen Page is developing into one of the top actresses around.  The film is very complicated and requires several viewings to really understand everything.  For that reason I didn't give it a full five stars.
B003KNDMXG|2.0|After a couple of copies, it looks like this is a bad pressing -- skips in the same spot in the first track. A shame.
0440178002|5.0|Every now and then, a book is written so well that it leaves the reader in awe and this was certainly one of those books. Reading this book is the nearest thing to actually going back in time to feudal Japan.  Clavell's character development is, in my opinion, a work of genius. Each character is so unique and so complex that it serves to draw the reader in deeper and deeper.  I'm not sure if it is 100% historically accurate but it does follow the history of that period in Japan - I've read other non-fiction books about Japan since reading this and have not found any major contradictions.  The only negative about the book is that it makes finding other books of this caliber very difficult.  The other books in the series are also quite good but this is Clavell's masterpiece or even  better put: a masterpiece.  While some of the other books in the series deserve 5 starts, it makes it impossible, using the rating system, to distinguish this book as it should be.  Also, don't let the length of the book  put you off - it could have had twice the number of pages and you'd still be disappointed when it ends.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Although this series does not keep totally to the \\"Sword of Truth\\" books written by Terry Goodkind, it is equally as good. The casting is exellent. The choice of New Zealand, as the setting, is inspired. If you want to be entertained by a very good fantasy series, then this is it. Even if you weren't a fantasy fan, as I am, I still believe you would enjoy this series. Good acting, great action sequences and effects, and great storytelling.   I watched both Series 1 & 2 on the SyFy channel (UK) and couldn't wait to get my hands on the DVDs. Thank goodness my DVD player is multi-regional. I have pre-ordered the second series on DVD.

B001GCUNWQ|2.0|Before you get all up in arms, note that I adore the first two `Ice Age' films.  In fact, I recently gave the first one a 5-star review.  I agree that these films layer on the sap sometimes and that Pixar is far better equipped to actually illicit emotions out of us, but these films have (up until now) delivered sheer comedic enjoyment.<br /><br />Sadly, `Dawn of the Dinosaurs' just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I'm going to make this short and (not so) sweet.  The film is basically too much of the same shtick.  There really is nothing new here.  The sequences seem like regurgitated moments from the two earlier (better) installments, and the whole `adventure' aspect of the films second half felt like a poorly realized `Dora' episode.  The funny moments were far and few in between.  That's what really upset me.  I can forgive a film like `Ice Age' for being slightly redundant if that redundancy produces the funny, but this film made me chuckle twice that I can think of (that helium scene was hilarious, but helium is always hilarious).  The `unusual' family aspect of this film is a great idea, but it just doesn't hold together so wonderfully here.  The films first half is too sappy and uneventful and the films second half is too predictable and uninspired.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this movie.<br /><br />The film borrows too heavily from more well rounded and better thought out films.  There are obvious comparisons to be made to Shrek, which is sad since this film should be able to stand on its own.  I also want to call to attention to crude jokes inserted in this film.  There were a handful of them, and I was kind of shocked.  I'm no prude, but this is a kid's movie, and some of the things done and said were highly inappropriate.  I didn't expect that from this movie.<br /><br />Scrat was the films main highlight (as he was for the first two films as well) and yet here his sub-plot also felt a tad forced.  The inclusion of the female counterpart was an obvious attempt to spruce up his storyline and add a layer of freshness to his tired routine, but it only worked in parts.<br /><br />All in all I can't really recommend this film.  The first two films are far better.  It's not awful, but it is far from good.  If you love the first two and have yet to see this, see it.  Simon Pegg is always welcome, and his character Buck has some nice moments.  Sadly though, this film fails to live up to what I expected and all that it could have (and should have) been.add a layer of freshness to his tired routine, but it only worked in parts.

0439023521|4.0|I have always been a sucker for books with good dystopian story lines and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins delivers on that very premise.  Set in the ruins of North America, in the country of Panem, the story details the lives in the twelve districts that surround The Capitol with. The Hunger Games focuses on the story of a sixteen-year-old girl from District Twelve,  named Katniss Everdeen, who's life consists of hunting in the woods with her friend Gale in order to keep her mother and her little sister, Prim,  alive.  However, on the day that Katniss' narration begins, survival is more important then ever. At two a celebration known as \\"The Reaping\\" occurs where a boy and a girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen will have their named picked from a bowl and made to fight for their survival in an arena where the Hunger Games will take place.  Katniss has done everything to make sure Prim is safe, but when Prim's name is drawn out of the bowl on Reaping Day, Katniss steps up to take her sister's place as a tribute.  Taken to the Capitol where she joins the other twenty-four tributes, Katniss is disgusted by the pageantry of what, in her mind, equates to an execution, and the politics that occur during her training days. Which is only made more complicated by the male tribute from her district, who may very well fancy her.  As the Hunger Games progress Katniss is faced with morality and survival in this tale of what it truly means to be human.    My first impression of this book was not a good one. I had problems imagining the world that Collins was setting up and I wasn't entirely sure that I got it straight.  The first likened the world of Panem to an old Victorian village, especially District Twelve, and then later started to imagine a world similar to Equilibrium. Finally when I managed to get the combination of technology with the poverty stricken districts, I found the book quite enjoying and was really taken by the politicking and how Collins was ableto weave it into a story that featured children.    Shortly after Part II began I found myself engrossed in the novel. I didn't want to put it down with each new stratagem that was devised and each alliance that was made.  In fact, one of the biggest successes I found of Part II was making me forget the politics of Part I and involving me in each move that the tributes made.   It isn't until Part III that the political aspect of the book picks up again leaving the reader starving--I know I can't help the pun--to read the sequel Catching Fire.    The lasting impression that The Hunger Games gave me was that this is not Twilight. Certainly there's action and adventure, even a love triangle, but its not the focus of the book. What this book gives readers is the haunting desire to question the motivations of a culture and think about what they would do if such a practice was implemented.  As I approached the end of The Hunger Games, I found myself reminded of The Draft. The practices of Reaping Day reminded me so much of that practice at the very end that I couldn't help but find myself desiring to read Catching Fire immediately, particularly since Katniss' transformation is so beautifully written.    Final Grade: A-
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Awesome product, works as promised. Bought it to send firewire audio from f800 to f400, I have tried other similar products that don't work - this one does!
0312335164|3.0|The basis of the story is the conflict between the real need that law enforcement and government has of being able to crack encrypted materials and the need for a private uncrackable encryption. But, the story itself revolves around the personalities and private agendas of the characters; not the technology. Unfortunately, I found the characters far too one dimensional and to a significant degree, unbelievable. I would categorize this as a read once on an otherwise boring rainy day when nothing better is available. Oh, and from my experience as a semiconductor chemist, if you're cooling with liquid nitrogen, and a line bursts, which in turn causes overheating of the cooled equipment, the nitrogen vaporizes, displaces the oxygen in the air (particularly in enclosed spaces), and PREVENTS fires.

B003C1QIO6|3.0|Let me say this first - I have all Jack Johnson's other albums, and I listen to them frequently.  After listening to this one a few times, it's just kind of bland compared to the others.<br /><br />Why?  There are really no songs that stand out. \\"You and Your Heart\\" has a bouncy beat, and I like it, but the rest of the songs seem like shadows of songs from other albums.<br /><br />Somebody in another review called this album \\"B-sides\\" and I'd agree.<br /><br />I like Jack's recent addition of the female voice to his songs.  \\"Give it Back\\" has some tantalizing sound to it, but never goes beyond the lyrics \\"give it back, give it back, give it back.\\"  It just seems like unfinished work.<br /><br />I might be a little hestitant to buy the next album.
0140186409|4.0|Everything was great with the ordering process; however, there was an awful lot of notes and underlining from the previous owner in the first couple of chapters.  This, to me, disqualifies it from being 'like new' by any stretch of the imagination.  Then again, what did I really expect for under $.50? I would recommend being a little more honest about the range of conditions that can be expected.
B003TZ9EGO|2.0|I suppose it says something about the quality of the original songs when remixing them just doesn't work as well!  There's no denying that the songs presented here from The Fame and The Fame Monster are all immaculate in their original state.  However, it seems that the various DJ's and musicians have had difficulty creating a good remix, as the songs here are unimpressive, bland and unimaginative.  The only two tracks worth listening to are the remixes of \\"Paparazzi\\" and \\"Alejandro\\".  \\"LoveGame\\" is interesting for a little bit just to hear Marilyn Manson's part, but that grows old very quickly.  Listening to the songs on this record only makes me pine to listen to the originals.  For Lady Gaga completionists, this release may suit you, but sadly this is the kind of record you listen to once or twice before it just collects dust.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|as a Paramore fan, this is a great album! a lil slow at times, but great music all the same :)
B000001DQI|5.0|If an album has three all time classics in my view, and nothing really to dislike, I'm going to have to give it a pretty good score. Apart from the all time classic tracks, the rest of the album is interesting enough...perhaps only a few songs are disposable. Album has good drumming on it and a phat bass sound often. My cd is listed as being a 1995 issue. Have seen a later release listed, with bonus tracks. My cd runs some 76:20, so it is quite demanding to listen to already, time wise. Think the cd with bonus tracks has four extra songs...doesn't really seem an incentive to get that version unless they have done something special with the sound. No complaints with the sound quality on this album though.      The all time classics:      Bennie and the Jets - a signature song for Elton. Instantly identifiable opening. Sort of a demented march with the piano playing. Elton sings in falsetto at times, to good effect. Have heard that this song 'crossed over' to black Americans, who bought it in droves. Funky is funky whatever your skin colour.     Goodbye yellow brick road - another unmistakeable piano intro to this song. Lovely falsetto melodies by Elton here...he's definitely an underrated vocalist in the pop-rock genre, for sure. Like the emphatic drum beats at times in this song.    Saturday night's alright for fighting - a wild, all time classic rock song...especially for the guitar riff and Elton's rock vocals. Bassy, tough drumming. Not sure, but my sound levels seem to drop a bit for a bit on my cd. Anyway, Elton gives one of the all time great rock vocal performances in this song. No falsetto here!      Next best:      Grey seal - this song now appears on Australian FM radio at times. Not sure that it had in the past...or at least as often as now. Has a a jaunty and catchy chorus. Elton's vocals are doubled up here. Has a 1970s style funky guitar part. Bongos or some such feature as well. \\"~\\"      Best of the rest:      Harmony - I like the broody parts tothis song as well as its poppy harmonies and melodies. Features acoustic guitar and some solid drum beats. Think this song has a double bass. Elton's vocals may be double up here...or maybe it's backing singers or something. \\"(.)\\"    Candle in the wind - another signature song for Elton...his ode to Marilyn Monroe. No doubt for many Elton fans this song would be the highlight of the album. Haven't really minded this song, but never fully embraced it. It's nice enough. Perhaps its currency has been devalued by Elton's re-do of this song in honour of Princess Diana...at her funeral, I believe. Has good drumming, backing coals, acoustic guitar and electric guitar. Subtle yet distinctive bass guitar. \\">(.)\\"    I've seen that movie too - has a jazz lounge vibe to it with Elton's tinkling piano playing. Jazz flavour enhanced by use of cymbals. Think a double bass drum is used here...if that is what they are called. Acoustic guitar, violins, bass and electric lead guitar at times. \\">(.)\\"    Sweet painted lady - slower tempo song. Deep bass, acoustic guitar, piano accordion and a trumpet, I think. Nice vocal melody and sing-along-able too. \\"[.}\\"      The rest:      Funeral for a friend/Love lies bleeding - album opener. 11:09 minute running time. For five minutes or so it's an instrumental...gothic and synthy...touch of \\"Oxygene\\" and \\"Phantom of the opera\\" to it...though it pre-dates those albums and soundtracks. The rest of the song has singing on it...turns into a rock song with rock guitar. Guitar has a touch of the later song \\"Saturday night's alright for fighting\\" to it for the \\"Love lies bleeding\\" segment on this song. A piano on \\"Love lies bleeding\\" reminds me of the sampled song used on the classic Australian hip-hop group The Hilltop Hoods' song \\"The nosebleed section\\". If that's right, I think that the melody they sampled pre-dates this Elton John album.    This song has no title - a piano instrumental for a lot of its running time. When the lyrics do kick it, they're wordy, but that's ok. A flute is used in this song, perhaps. Backing vocals at times. The synthesiser sounds odd at times.    Jamaica jerk-off - has a synthesiser drum beat sound to it. Reggae-ish, with multi-vocals. Has real drums too, which sound good. Keyboard sounds kitschy. A melody in this song reminds me of...is it \\"Under the boardwalk\\"? Maybe I have \\"Dock of the bay\\" in mind? Hmm.    The ballad of Danny Bailey (1909-34) - sort of a rock \\"The lonesome death of Hattie Carroll\\" song. Good drumming here, with some emphatic beats. Bassy, violins and some country sounding lead guitar. Song mentions \\"Dillinger\\"...a famous American criminal, I believe.     Dirty little girl - a rock song with a phat bass sound. Rock vocals, emphatic beats. Song has a \\"Signs\\" vibe to it (the 1960s protest song). Elton sounds a wee bit like Mick Jagger in this song. You get overdubbed vocals later on.     All the girls love Alice - bassy rock song. Overdubbed guitar perhaps...has a Led Zeppelin vibe to it in that respect. Got some brass...or that may just be the synthesiser.    Your sister can't twist (but she can rock'n'roll) - a jaunty rock song which references other songs...like stuff by The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Vocals have an ABBA vibe to them at times.  Kitschy keyboard...MGMT's terrific \\"Oracular spectacular\\" album had this kind of element to it at times (on, say, \\"Kids\\"). Bassy.    Roy Rogers - some piano notes on this song bring to mind INXS' good song \\"By my side\\". Country style lead guitar turns up again. Doubled up vocals. Violins. Might be a bit of a grower, this song, like the song above.    Social disease - song fades louder as it starts...bit faint at the start. A country rock song, featuring the banjo. Elton threatens to yodel at times! Lead guitar plays in a country music kind of way too.      Elton John recommendations:      Too low for zero - been years since I've heard this album, but I remember loving it as child.    Jump up! - had some songs I likedon this, which never really turned up on compilations. Might have to reacquaint myself with this album and see if it is on cd now.
0452273331|2.0|My, how time has a way of changing us.  I first read The Fountainhead many years ago, while still in high school, and I clearly remember liking it a lot.  It seemed then a compelling, well-written page-turner, filled with memorable characters and one finely-honed scene after another.  So imagine my surprise when I picked the book up again not long ago and discoverd after only a few hundred pages that the brilliant masterpiece I remembered so fondly is in reality little more than turgid melodrama populated with cartoonish characters, all built around a philosophy (I use the word loosely) that only a self-centered egoist could have come up with.       What are the elements of good literature?  Consistently well-crafted prose?  Multi-dimensional characters imbued with the foibles of real human beings?  A grappling with mature themes and subject-matter?  Boundless imaginative energy?  Relentless narrative drive?  The Fountainhead sadly falls short on all counts.          The book's plot largely involves the tribulations of Howard Roark, a brilliant, dynamic architect whose singular vision of the future (which always takes the form of buildings, of course) is forever being thwarted by a world in which conformity is valued over individualism, and where Utilitarianism (the greatest good for the greatest number) is the overriding principle around which society is organized.  The world of The Fountainhead, in short, is one that seeks to hobble genuis while rewarding mediocrity, and Roark, being something of a Knight errant, is determined to turn this world on its head.  Aiding him in his quest is beautiful, headstrong  Dominique, who despite her own strong will has a weakness for powerful men; and Guy Bannister, a newspaper magnate who sees in Roark the embodiment of an ideal that he himself lacks, and who willingly risks his hard-won empire to help further Roark's cause.  Arrayed against Roark are an assemblange of sycophants, lackeys and dupes, all of whom Rand portrays asbeing little better than sheep.  If you're looking for a novel that deals with life's gray areas, for a book that dares venture into the disorienting fog of ethics and morality, The Fountainhead is not for you.  Here everything is either black or white, good or bad, right or wrong.  On the other hand The Fountainhead does contain all of the elements of a good read.  Romance.  Murder.  Deception.  Betrayal.  A climatic courtroom battle--in short, the very essence of good pulp fiction.  But, unfortunately, Ayn Rand never intended The Fountainhead to be taken as pulp fiction, and as evidenced by more than a few of the reviews posted here, many of her readers don't see it as pulp fiction, either.  They see it instead as a blueprint for the future.                            Admittedly, Rand's prose at its best is succinct and transparent, with sentences that move the story forward without getting too much in the way.  And occasionally her writting is even borderline lyrical, especially in the book's early descriptive passages where Rand seems most at ease.  But let her start describing one of her heroic characters -- Howard Roark, Dominique, Guy Bannister -- and all of a sudden we're deep in the land of Purple Prose.  Every man's profile is seemingly chiseled out of granite. Every torso is as sharp and angular as the images in a cubist painting. Michelangelo's David would envy the physique Rand gives Howard Roark.   Dominique's statuesque figure exists only in the imaginations of pre-pubescent boys.  These aren't characters Rand is creating, certainly not characters meant to represent real flesh-and-blood human beings; these are merely cardboard cutouts that Rand can manipulate in the service of her plot, which in turn exists only to further explicate her sophmoric philosophy.  And as for the character's thoughts and musings, they generally range from the historionic to the banal with little else in between.  If one didn't know any better, one would swear these \\"people\\" all suffer from a sever case of bi-polar disorder.  Case in point: Dominique is a model of independence, determined to make her own way in life; that is until Howard Roark rapes her (there's no other way to describe their first coupling), at which point she becomes totally subservient to Roark's will and ambition.                For what it's worth, it's interesting to note that there isn't a single child to be found anywhere in Rand's massive tome.  And the only two people who are less than physically perfect are the art critic Ellsworth Toohey (can there be any greater parasite than a professional critic?), and his \\"crippled\\" niece, a social worker (maybe not as bad as a critic, but still beyond redemption).  In both cases their physical imperfections serve as outter manifestations of their inner flaws.  Both characters are portrayed as morally weak, conniving, manipulative, and imprudent.  And poor Ellsworth Toohey: descriced as squat, swarthy, hairy, with an almost rodent-like countenance, his appearance could easily have been lifted straight out of the agit-prop \\"literature\\" of 1930's Germany used to stir up anti-Semitism.  In the forward to my paperback copy of The Fountainhead, Rand describes a night in the early 1940's, her book as yet unfinished, when she was overcome with a sense of dispair upon realizing that the vast majority of people in the world were far less intelligent, less ambitious, and less productive than was she.  How could such a drab, uncreative world ever possibly understand the likes of a Howard Roark?  A Dominique?  A Guy Bannister?  Or for that matter Ayn Rand herself?  Fortunately for Rand, her husband was there to talk her out of her dispair that night, and thus she was able to finish her book and bequeath it to the undeserving masses.     I guess this brings us finally to Rand's \\"philosophy\\" of Objectivism.  But is it really a philosophy? as rigorously thought out as, say, Kant's theory of knoweldge? or Locke's principles of democratic government?  Or is it really just a disjointed world-view expounded upon ad infinitum in one big novel after another.  Personally, I believe the latter.  Rand titled another of her books \\"The Virtues of Selfishness,\\" which in fact is a more apt description of her world-view than is Objectivism. But perhaps an even more apt desription would be \\"Survival of the Fittest,\\" or \\"Dog Eat Dog,\\" or \\"Every Man (and Woman) For Himself.\\"  Because, after all, isn't that what Objectivism really is in the end?  To quote that old poster from the Sixties: \\"You Do Your Thing, And I'll Do Mine, I'm Not Here To Fulfill Your Expectations, And You're Not Here To Fulfill Mine...\\" and so on and so forth.  In other words, just let things run their course without rules or regulations, and in the end we'll see who comes out on top.  The funny thing about the followers of Objectivism is that, like believers in reincarnation who all imagine themselves as having been kings and queens in past lives, Objectivists all see themselves as standing on top of the social and economic heap when the dust finally settles.  And that may be so for a few of them.  But the truth is, in a world where anything goes, for many of them, should they ever get their wish, it's just going to be one long hard scramble at the bottom of the hill.       I never finished my second reading of The Fountainhead, and although I still have my copy of the book, I doubt I ever will.  I'm giving the book two stars instead of one largely for sentimental reasons, and because more often than not the book is well written.  If a young person ever asks me, should I read The Fountainhead? I'll say, \\"Sure, if you feel you must, then go ahead and enjoy it.  But whatever you do, don't take the damn thing seriously.\\"
0691142165|4.0|This was an interesting read and I have read a fair share of Economics books to put it mildly. The most interesting<br />theory this book turned me onto was the work that was done by Ricardo Hausmann and Federico Sturzenegger of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University..ever since then I have been trying to understand a new economic theory that attempts to answer an intriguing puzzle in our international trade and finance statistics: why is it that the US has a positive income of around $30 billion when our net international investment position shows a debt of about $3 trillion. How can be earning income on debt?<br /><br />This new theory claims that, in part, our current measures of investment miss a large chunk of intangible assets -- what they label \\"dark matter\\", akin to the concept in astrophysics where the known mass of the universe is not large enough to explain why gravity can hold the universe together, that there is more mass (some \\"dark matter\\") in the universe that we can see and measure. Just as astrophysicists can impute the amount of that dark matter from the laws of physics (how much is needed to explain how gravity is working), these economist have imputed the amount of economic \\"dark matter\\" missing from our international asset position. The conclusion is that we really aren't in debt at all. The policy implication is that the trade deficit and international debt don't matter and that the dreaded currency correction (where the dollar falls enough to bring our trade balance back in line) won't happen.<br /><br />Aside from that this book uses sharp analysis and comprehensive data, Reinhart and Rogoff document that financial fallout's occur in clusters and strike with surprisingly consistent frequency, duration, and ferocity. They examine the patterns of currency crashes, high and hyperinflation, and government defaults on international and domestic debts--as well as the cycles in housing and equity prices, capital flows, unemployment, and government revenues around these crises. While countries do weather their financial storms, Reinhart and Rogoff prove that short memories make it all too easy for crises to recur.<br /><br />I suggest checking it out - Kindle version just because available!<br /><br />Cheers -<br /><br />Jefferynues around these crises.

B003O85W3A|5.0|I bought The Suburbs last week, and have listened to it five times now, so I've allowed this album to grow on me.    I liked this album on first listen and I've liked it even more with each listen.  However, there are two songs, \\"Month of May\\" and \\"Modern Man\\", that are the weakest tracks on the album. Those songs are slowly growing on me with each listen.     Any serious music fan should own this album.  I discover something new that I like about this album with every listen.  I played the album for my boyfriend who is a serious music lover.  He had never heard Arcade Fire before, and he loved the album. He pointed out something that I would normally have missed - the use of a Mellotron on one song, \\"Half Light II\\".    Let me also say that I do own both Funeral and Neon Bible.  In my opinion The Suburbs is far better than both those albums, and is their best one yet.  It'll be interesting to see how they top this album with their next release!    Finally, if anyone is considering buying an Arcade Fire album, and not sure where to start, I can say with experience that The Suburbs would be the album to start with, and then get Neon Bible and then Funeral.
1579126278|3.0|I had high hopes for this book. I really expected to be knocked off my feet with the surprise ending everyone talked about. It seems I am the only one who WAS NOT shocked at the end. I think the \\"reveal\\" would have been much more effective if Christie would have told us the murderer's name first and then let Poirot give the evidence. It's not hard at all to figure out who the culprit is as Poirot says \\"the murderer has to be someone who is this, had this, and was here when.....\\". By the time Poirot finally revealed the name, I had no doubt who was guilty. I was totally let down. I wish I hadn't figured it out. This is in no way a bad book. It is as good as everyone says. Yet, so much rides on the \\"reveal\\" so if you don't figure it out, it will make all the difference in the world in your opinion of the book.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|If you're afraid to buy this album because of Relapse and The Eminem Show, you should be. His last two albums were absolutely terrible in my opinion. This, however, brings back the old Eminem. This is now one of my favorite Eminem albums. The reason I gave it four stars is because although it's worlds better than the last two albums, it's still not as good as his first 2-3 albums, and I feel like he could have done better.    With that said, some of the songs on this album are amazing. Talking 2 Myself is probably my favorite song on the album although it will never be a single. The lyrics, chorus, and instrumental go perfectly together. Besides that, my favorites were : Going Through Changes (which samples Black Sabbath's \\"Changes\\"), Not Afraid, No Love (which samples Haddaways's \\"What is Love\\", and Love the Way you Lie.
B002WOQFZG|5.0|Got the set for Christmas 2009 after looking through the first book at Barnes and Noble.  LOVED IT!  I love fiction and Greek mythology so these books were perfect for me!  This is a beautiful set for someone who loves quick reads, fiction and an interesting plot!<br /><br />I loved these books so much that I finished all 5 in 6 days! Each book has an interesting plot of its own.  It's not necessary to have read the previous books to understand any of the books.  The plot picks up pretty fast so you aren't left with a long boring intro. And once it grabs a hold of you, you just can't put it down.  But it's not so complicated that you head hurts from trying to keep up with it. Riordan strikes a perfect balance between keeping you on your toes and not losing you completely. Rick Riordan's writing is very easy to read.  His sarcastic sense of humor puts a nice touch to the stories.<br /><br />I would highly recommend the books to everyone!
B0035WTE2U|5.0|AC/DC shows on this album, how big they are... no matter this album is a recopilation of songs already released, their music sounds as fresh as the day they release them. And the extra DVD and booklet, adds more visual content that fix perfectly, making this album a must to have to every AC/DC fan. Tho thumbs up.
0316017922|4.0|Great premise.  Very interesting and thought provoking.  I did not enjoy the last half of the book however.  I feel he stated his case very well in the first half but there were no new ideas presented in the 2nd half.  My advice is to get the book and read the first half and stop when you get bored.  On the strength of this book, I would be interested in checking out (pardon the pun) his other books..

0143035711|5.0|Bob Mason has written a stunning book about ordinary people caught up in the eternal madness of War. It could be any war, but Bob's war was Vietnam.    Chickenhawk puts you right there in the cockpit of a Huey Slick (the Slicks were the troop carriers, rather than having a Gunship or Medevac/Dustoff role) as Bob takes you into endless near-impossible hot LZ operations to deploy, extract and supply/re-supply the kids who were in the front lines of a war that should never have happened.    His technical descriptions of the extreme combat flying techniques that he had to employ in order to survive under heavy fire, are exceptional. Yet the heart of the book lies not in his haunting yet beautifully described combat scenarios, but in his humanity and ruthless honesty and soul searching, as he tries to come to terms with what the war did to him as a human being.    Bob is a living testimony to the truth that PTSD is a normal reaction to an insane situation, and the fact the Nam Vets who suffer from PTSD are not the ones who are crazy. The dishonest war mongers whose machinations denied Ho Chi Minh his chance to rule a united Vietnam via free elections, are the ones who are insane, and the ones who should single-handedly carry the Guilt that the war generated among so many who were caught up in it.    Welcome home, soldier.
0525423842|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  As I was reading I realized that book was written in a simplistic way.  When I finished and read the back cover I realized that Theodore Boone was written for a young audience.  As a school teacher I could see that the book would be a great book with a great meaning for students to read.  I would highly recommend to all.
B001F290E4|4.0|Never been a Seal fan before, but if you like soul and blusey tunes, you'll love this CD!
B002ZG997C|5.0|Absolutely superb film. I guess there is no category for most bizarre, original opening scene of a film. The surreal element incorporated in the drama is actually frightening, but on a very subtle level of one's consciousness. Regardless of how I feel, &#34;The Book of Eli&#34; has become a favorite of home theater movie crowd DVD collections.
0385341008|2.0|I JUST COULDN'T GIVE IT A HIGHER RATING---SORRY.<br />I THINK THAT THE BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITHOUT ALL--ALL--ALL---<br />OF THE DIFFERENT LETTERS FROM ALL--ALL--ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.<br />I GOT SO CONFUSED THAT I HAD TO CREATE A \\"\\"CHEAT-SHEET\\"\\" OF WHO WAS WHO!!!<br />I REALLY--REALLY LIKE THE WHOLE OCCUPATION END OF THE STORY---THAT WAS GREAT.<br />THE LETTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SKIPPED AND THE OCCUPATION CONCENTRATED ON.<br />AGAIN---SORRY.
144471032X|2.0|I decided to follow this diet plan because it seemed sensible and healthy.  I only have abut 15 pounds to lose and i have a very healthy eating habits. I followed the diet for 7 days and I only lost 1 pound on the first day, which was probably just water, not fat.  So the sacrifice of not eating veggies, fruit and carbs for such a long period of time was not worth it for me.  This diet may work better for people that have more weight to lose.
B002Q9VPFM|4.0|For fans of the movie, this is a must have. The extended version is brilliant. I purchased this from Amazon as Warner Brothers will not release this version of the dvd in Australia.  However, overseas customers beware - The digital copy (theatrical version) will not work unless you have a US/Canada itunes store account. The insidious DRM is alive and well. That's the only disappointment.
B002ZG97RE|3.0|was ok not as good as I thought it would be. love Matt damon as an actor.The Bourne series were much better
B0036EH3WK|5.0|OMG...I cant believe the amazing astounding journey that is LOST is over....I rarely buy anything related to the media but when it comes to LOST I cant resist buying everything for it!! I already have season 1-5 on dvd and I sold them so I could buy this whole box set on blu ray...:p I LOVE THIS SHOW. I cannot wait to see all the easter eggs and all the extra stuff included in this...it will help me ease off the sadness and loss of never getting to see another brilliant episode :) As others said...it will help us \\"let go\\"
1439102813|4.0|Still Alice was recommended in a magazine as a good summer read and for me, it fit the bill perfectly.  I like to read for fun, but I always want to learn something.  I like serious emotion but I hate sap.  Definitely not sappy -- but I was weepy several times.  Although, I agree with the critical reviews that the writing wasn't great it, somehow the simplicity of the writing let the Alzheimer's be the center.  I would have liked to see some better character development.  I really would have liked Alice to have a good friend and have been able to view Alice and the illness through her.  If you need something \\"light\\" but not trivial you will like it.
0553804367|5.0|I saw this book in a large brick and mortar book store and it was over $20 for the soft cover.  I figured I'd check Amazon to see what the price was here -- then 5mins and $4 later, I ordered the hardcover.  It arrived on the first day of the estimated delivery day range and it was in great condition.  No complaints here - gotta love Amazon!
0439023491|5.0|Despite the complaints I've heard from others, I love this book.  Although a little more slowly paced than the first book, I find it more realistic.  The Hunger Games was amazing.  HOWEVER, I believe that Catching Fire was needed to give Katniss more depth as a character.  I really enjoy these books so far, and I am anticipating the conclusion.<br /><br />All in all- Kudos to Suzanne Collins for writing a good 'middle book'.
B000G75994|5.0|i heard  performer Maria Joao on the radio and was stunned with the clarity and how easy it was to imagine Mozrt playing the piece...granted on a modern piano.  the Deutsce grammaphon once again is superb.<br />enjoy
B002SJIO5E|3.0|okay movie for sci fi action movie with a twist.  Nothing special, but nothing bad either.  Give or take, will not purchase on BR. Maybe if/ when on sale for $5
B00008CHEX|3.0|i have both the US release with the same cover-the stained glass-and now the japanese version-  I purchased this one as I understood it to have the same mix as the original 1973 album, which i have, and which mix which was ALSO the same mix in the original EMI/Japanese CD.  I don't think it is.  Read on.  This Japanese version-based upon my listening back to back to my original US version of the same cover art (the 30th anniversary edition) is identical, or at least, I can hear no difference at all through my electrostatic headphones, -not a different nor more 'stereo' mix -nor the 'softness' the other reviewer mentions.  I am a musician and do listen carefully.  While it may be there, I cannot hear it, and as a result, I do not think this version merits the premium price (unless you're into the 'obi' and the Japanese aspect or some collectible aspect.  The version I purchased has the same liner notes as the US version (30th Anniv with the same cover art  as well as an almost identical outer case art-the difference being references to being 'made in japan' etc-ie the fine print on the back.   The CD comes with the obi (the little paper overlay which laps the front and back and covers the binding) and a Japanese insert translating the inside booklet.   Just to help you decide, if you are seeking a copy of the original, Japanese EMI CD from 1984.  I remember wanting it when first released, rare even then, with my first CD player, and not willing to spend $50 for it at a time when most CDs were about $10-12 (and the rock offerings were less than 50 albums in CD format).  Please red the comments for more, and important info on this CD so that the reader can better appreciate the limit of my review.
B001FB55H6|2.0|Didn't buy wouldn't buy, dark grim movie of super heros who are not really heros or even good. The one good guy was made to look bad the entire time and killed in the end by a fellow hero/ freak.  Didn't buy it, want a refund from going to see it when it came out.
B002T9H2L0|2.0|This film is total fantasy.  A feel good about killing Nazi's kinda flick.  There is a lot of sadistic killing in this film which seems almost to relish in it.  The plot is totally fantastic, the ending pure lunacy and fantasy.  What is the appeal of these super Commando Dirty Dozen WW2 films? Do people like the killing machine elements about them, or just the complete fanatastic violence?? Surely there is so much more that can be made about WW2 that would have its basis in reality, and yet have the entertaining elements that producers seem to think movies like this require.<br /><br />The true history of WW2 provides many examples of incredible events that could each be made into a worthwhile film that would entertain  as well as show actual events.  Why create total fantasy?  The original film had little to recommend it, but at least it didn't let itself get totally carred away.<br /><br />This film is a complete waste of time unless you like basic kill the bad guys kinda thing.  There is little to recommend it to the serious viewer on the subject.  Its a comic book on screen.  In fact most WW2 Comic books have a bit more to recommend them than this!  If you seek total fantasy and mindless, crual violence then go for it!
B001E75QGG|5.0|Great movie as all indiana Jones movies are usually. To bad H. Ford is getting old, would like to see about 10 more made, LOL..
0307454541|1.0|Ditto to what most of the other 1 star reviewers have already said.  I really can't believe so many people liked it.  It goes back and forth between reeeeally boring story telling and graphic horrible rape/murders.  What the heck is entertaining about that?  I only finished reading it out of guilt because my mother bought it for me.  I didn't connect with any of the characters in it at all other than their obvious love of coffee and IKEA furniture.  When I got to the end and saw an exceprt from the next book describing yet another grotesque rape, I couldn't wait to slam it shut.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|its a movie you like it or you don't.  Bonus CD was nice to get and works great with iTunes
B000L53D4O|4.0|My son is 11 months old and loves this walker. It's fast on hardwood floors so I had to slow it down by putting a phone book in it. It can tip over if he starts lifting it up and banging it on the floor so you just can't turn him loose with it. He likes the toys on front and it's the first toy he goes for in the morning.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Great movie, great deal here at Amazon. For the price of a normal DVD only I got the BR, DVD, and digital copy in one package.  Couldn't be happier.     Hope to see a 2nd Sherlock Holmes movie soon.
B003E66Y2A|5.0|My grandchildren have enjoyed this quality video many many times since I gave it to them.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Hope they make more before HJ gets to old to play Wolverine always my favorite character in the x-men growing up.  Entire comic book series on just him.  Great movie, looking forward to more.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Again, I love watching him.  If not for PBS Special I would never have known his music!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Never was a huge Star Trek fan (old series) but did watch it as a kid.  Liked most all the movies growing up. This movie is awesome. With more action and new twists then the old versions. Looking forward to seeing more of the new crew in upcoming Star Trek films.
0316666343|4.0|This book grabs you from the start, I persoanlly didnt put it down until I finished it the day I started it. This would be a great vacation weekend book.
0132350882|5.0|One of the best books I've read about how to design and produce quality code. Being a professional software developer/craftsman is more than just being able to solve hard technical problems (among other things). It's being able to solve them with elegance and style, and this book helps you develop the knowledge and skills to do just that.
B003HARV7A|5.0|Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) decides she wants to hitchhike to Vegas to become a \\"dancer\\" and from there, the fireworks start. Not ten minutes before she arrives in town, she is robbed and propositioned for sex. In a fit of rage, which Nomi is prone to, she bangs on a car and throws up in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd. only to be rescued by her new lifelong friend, Molly.  After a brief quasi-lesbian encounter, Molly buys Nomi some fries and a coke; which she mostly tosses around violently instead of eating. Despite being a total jerk, Molly invites Nomi to live with her; and so it begins - Nomi fights her way to the top and never looks back.    Showgirls truly is, the worst-best-film ever made. It is a triumph of terrible cinema. The mere fact that this movie got made is baffling. There are too many memorable scenes to list here; I suggest buying a copy of this DVD immediately - you will not be disappointing.
0143038419|5.0|I received the \\"eat pray love\\" used paperback book in great shape, and within 6 days.    The book itself was very readable and enjoyable!!  This story is autobiographical and covers mainly 12 months in the author's life as she travels to 3 specific countries (Italy, India, and Indonesia), and searches for some understanding and balance in her life following a very rocky divorce and some bad decisions, etc.     The author is very self-centered initially, but she slowly becomes less so as the book marches on.  While she never looses that characteristic completely, she does progress and improve in her tolerance for seeing and meeting others needs besides her own.  The book is loaded with cleverness, pathos, humor, some sadness, heart-jerking love stories, and many, many quotable lines.    I read it for a Literati Book Club that I recently joined.    Plat
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|I loved X-Men and X-Men 2, X-Men 3 was quality but lackluster / compressed.  Wolverine Origins is complete garbage.  Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, but this movie blows.  Deadpool is Baraka / Cyclops?  Adamantium bullet made Wolverine lose his memory?  Almost no blood in the fighting scenes?  Wolverine WILLINGLY went to Weapon X - to get back at Sabretooth no less?     Just garabage, they should reboot X-Men simply because of this movie.  Here's hoping X-Men First Class is well done.
0440236738|4.0|Book held my interest from beginning to end. Read it in one day. Thoroughly surprised by the twist at the end. I will look for more by this author.
1400064287|5.0|Ideas are useless if people can't remember them. And there's simply no better book for unlocking the precious gift of how to do this than Chip & Dan's. Easy to read and highly memorable this is one of the best text books I've ever read. It gently takes the reader through the theory and easily identifiable action points of a perfect idea. And would you believe it, they even use the acronym SUCCES [sic] - a memorable and neat idea for a start! All you need to do is remember to buy it, it'll change your life for the better. Why am I writing this review? I have to confess I found it incredibly useful when writing my latest book: The art of being chosen - and it would have been wrong not to have owned up to this fact.
B002VECLVO|4.0|I enjoyed this film very much while watching it over   at a friend's house this past weekend.   So much so that I purchased it for my own collection.   Colin Firth delivers a subtle and potent tour de force   acting job in this and brought Christoper Isherwood's   character of a lonely, grieving, emotionally sheathed   middle-aged closeted gay college professor in early  1960's L.A. to life with such singular skill & passion!  You can feel his isolation/alienation and his longing   so strongly that you'll hurt for him at times.   I think Tom Ford brilliantly produced, wrote for   the screen, and directed this film in such a way that  it's amazing to me that this was his first time out!  This film has a definite stylistic aesthetic to it.  He has found yet another talent in which he's very good at.    I loved that the relationship between Colin Firth and   Matthew Goode was played so matter-of-factly, and not   over-sensationalized as alot of gay relationships are   often portrayed in films and television.   It was just as it should be...two people who met and fell   deeply in love over time and who made a beautiful life   together for 16 years, filled with intimacies, joy, pain,  mutual respect, understanding, and the chemistry they   portrayed together was palpable!    The fact that they were two men was like an after thought.   LOVE IS LOVE, was subtlely communicated without being   too preachy about it. When fate intercedes and that   relationship is forever changed, further compounded by the  callous disregard of his feelings and their relationship's  validity by his partner's stodgy family, Firth plays   that notification scene with such emotion and power that   one can't help but be moved by it!  He is a broken man after that who just goes through life   on auto-pilot mostly and decides that he has had enough  of this exsistence and wants to reunite with his love.  His ray of light amid all the darkness is played by   Julianne Moore, who also delivers a greatperformance  as his close freind who has her own issues but is always  there for her dear friend who satisfies her desire to be   needed as she has been abandoned by her husband and her  son is now grown and off in the world on his own.  These two share a colorful history and understand the   light and dark of each other perfectly well.   He knows where all her bodies are buried, and she   knows where all his are! (-: Their dinner scene brings   the levity to this film. There are also alot of flashbacks   in this film which help to bring the story together better.  The actor who plays the young college student who is   determined to be a part of Firth's character's life   because he is drawn to him, the twinky Nicholas Hoult,   does an excellent job at bringing some light into Firth's character's life too.   Although I was a bit skeptical and apprehensive   about his motives at first!   Then fate intercedes again at the end and throws   a curveball that I didn't see coming....  Though upon a second viewing, there were subtle   hints of what was to come! (-:      Overall, a beautiful story, brought to life beautifully,   and well worth a viewing or two before you decide if it's  worthy enough to be added to your personal collection.
B002VECMAO|4.0|\\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\" is an amusing and silly film with a great cast, but it's ultimately inconsequential. If you looking for just a fun movie about crazy people doing crazy things, then you might like this film. Granted, the plot is anything but mind-blowing, but the dialogue is pretty funny, and the actions relating to the Jedi soldiers are pretty amusing. The cast all does well with their roles and are mostly pretty funny. Ewan McGregor was probably the weakest, but he was also the narrator/straight man for much of the movie. Plus, there's goats falling down. Add to the fact that the film makes liberal use of the band Boston's \\"More Than a Feeling,\\" and can you really fault this movie?
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I wasn't a Neil Young big fan, until I eard this impressive, beautiful live recording.<br />The only defect is on the DVD: In some parts of the film he's not framed, replaced by some scenes a bit unnecessary ...<br />But when he's framed, he shows a kind of beauty hidden under his long hair.
0399156577|4.0|I read some the bad reveiws of this book, and I can't agree with them.  This book for me was pretty interesting. I like learning about new things.  I like dogs, and cranky men.  Fiona did come off a little bland, but putting myself into her character, I see that I would do everything that wouldn't get me noticed.  She lives life on her own terms.  Simon was a old romantic fool, wasn't he? The story reminds us that when we are not looking, along comes love in many disguises. Throw in a little murder, some dogs, woodworking, and two people bond. Isn't love grand? Lets say, I wasn't bored, but I would have liked the murderer to have been more of a mystery.  I wish she would have kept us guessing more.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Sound quality and surround is great. After playing using only the TV's speakers and standard Microsoft headset these took a minute to get use to; for example, playing MW2, a harrier strike will drown out nearby gunfire. These make it possible to hear footsteps clearly and background music in areas I didn't know there was any. All in all, a great gaming headset, my only complaint is that the headphones require the wireless base, they are not at all portable since you have no secondary option of using a cord.
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|Not much to say about a case.  Main thing is that it protects my camera nicely, and I also use it for my HTC EVO.  It fits on your belt nicely and I feel it provides an adequate amount of protection for either a phone, mp3 player, or point and shoot camera.
0743298039|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale is a terrific tale on the most basic level, that of the simple written word, but it is also very good on another level, that of the mind. Our book club chose this volume for the month of July and we were amazed at the many \\"layers\\" of discussion that developed. The story itself was intriguing, but we talked for a couple hours about meanings and interpretations.     Without ruining the story, one of our biggest disagreements was about who died in the fire. It could be interpreted two ways and, seemingly, there was no way to prove one or the other right or wrong. This is the perfect type of book for discussion-- the reader needs to be able to marshall her facts, present them and then defend them if necessary. Only the author can say.    I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mystery.
1572703253|3.0|This may be more engaging as a 'real read' than as an audio listen, so I will add my 2-cents: fine for commuting, but somewhat dissatisfying audio book - average with Stephanie Cole.  As to the story, (1) predictability is really quite tenuous, and (2) character development provides few whom the listener can 'love.'  Reason to care about the body in the library?  A sweet young thing pretty much covers it. A bit of fun is had when Miss Marple unravels the case in closing, showing all the pert signs of a sweet, perceptive and well-grounded English villager.
B001AEF6C2|4.0|Anthony Michael Hall and Kelly LeBrock star in this 1985<br />John Hughes comedy. Two nerdy teens create a computer-<br />generated supermodel. I grew up watching this and glad<br />to have it on dvd. It has nice picture and sound plus a<br />couple neat extras. I recommend this 80's classic.
B001AQT11M|5.0|It was a good purchasing experience. Everything went easy and smooth. Timely delivery. I would repeat buying from this vendor, which I recommend.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy   and Judd Nelson star in this 1985 John Hughes comedy-drama.   Five high school teens spend a Saturday in detention and get   to know each other. I've always liked this film and this dvd   has nice picture and sound plus a couple neat extras. This   is pure 80's I recommend.
0316067938|5.0|I'm tired of reading bad reviews on Breaking Dawn! I'm a big Twilight fan, I've been following the series ever since Twilight first came out. I have to say I didn't have any negative response to Breaking Dawn at all! I was so surprised to see all the nagative comments! I personally think it is the perfect ending to the Twilight Saga!! Now, I guess don't read below this if you haven't read it yet (spoiler alert)      People complain about Bella's baby...come on! It's perfect! Bella and Edward have a family now, and of course it's a super intelligent and powerful half vampire child! I wouldn't have seen this coming, but I love it!  I also LOVE that Jacob imprints on Renesme!! Now Bella and Jacob can be family, but without that weirdness. Jacob is no longer hurting over Bella, and now there's room for a whole new series!. PLEASE STephenie Meyer, make a book or a whole series following Jacob and Renesme!!  The only thing that I admit was slightly weak was the end fight with the Volturi. I loved  Bella's shield, that was great. But I guess people expected an actual fight. But I'm glad no one died!  I just love it :)
B000BNX4MC|4.0|Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara and Jeffrey Jones  star in this 1986 John Hughes comedy. A teen plays hooky  with his friends while his principal tries to catch him. I've   liked this since I was a kid and glad to have this special  edition. It has nice picture and sound plus cool extras.  I highly recommend this 80's comedy classic.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This is such a sweet movie.  Keep a box of Kleenex close by. I had my teen grandchildren watch and they were touched.  I kept renting it and finally just bought it through Amazon.
B000FZETIO|4.0|Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy and Jon Cryer star<br />in this 1986 romantic comedy-drama. A girl has a<br />crush on a rich guy and gets social pressure. I've<br />always enjoyed this film and glad to have it on<br />dvd that has nice picture and sound plus neat<br />extras. I recommend this good 80's romance<br />flick.
0375413405|3.0|Lots of great recipes, but there is a lot of wine, so if you don't like the taste of alcoholic beverages then you will be unable to use this book.  They say that the alcohol cooks off but I don't find that the taste goes away.  I also find that there are a lot of recipes that a busy person is unable to do, planning ahead is of great importance.  I have not tried any recipes yet because of the time it takes.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|If you like Westerns you have simply got to add this one to your collection. Val Kilmer deserved an oscar for his performance as Doc Holiday. Do not expect a history lesson. This is pure entertainment.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I have been listening to Megadeth since they came out with Symphony of Destruction.  I have all their records and I can say they have change quite a bit with every lineup.  Endgame is not a second version of RIP but instead a mix of all their 80's and 90's styles.    There are songs that reminds me of S.of Destruction like How the Story Ends and there are others like 1320 and Headcrusher that reminds me of Killing is my business.  You have to check Dave's solo in \\"The right to go insane\\" which reminds me RIP's Tornado of Souls.  If you like metal... get this one!    Do not get me wrong... I do listen to other bands like Anthrax, Cradle of Filth, Slayer, Metallica, Lamb of God but one thing is for sure, Endgame is one of my fav. albums of recent years.  I knew adding Chris Broderick to Megadeth was an awesome idea, so check it out!
0439023491|5.0|Warning if you have not read the first book in this series, The Hunger Games, this review will contain a spoiler or two. I started this book the same night I finished The Hunger Games. After much crying over Rue I was nervous for what the second book in this series had in store. Catching Fire was just as amazing as the first book even though I once again cried my eyes out about Rue when Katniss and Peeta toured District 11.<br /><br />The Hunger games are now officially behind them. Now Katniss can move on with life right? Wrong. Her perceived act of defiance (that kept Peeta alive) has made her the catalyst for an uprising against the Capital. Katniss, \\"The girl who was on fire\\" has created a spark and now she will have to face the consequences. Suddenly Katniss has much bigger problems then her conflicting feels for Peeta and her best friend Gale.<br /><br />On top of everything, it is the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games which means that it is the year of the Quarter Quill. The Quarter Quill is a Hunger Games with a twist, which no one knows about until it is announced just before the reaping. This year the twist is worse then Katniss could have imagined.<br /><br />I can't wait for the third and final book in this series, \\"Mockingjay.\\" Like I mentioned in my review for The Hunger Games, I am glad in a way that I waited to start this series for so long because I only have to wait two more weeks to read the conclusion. I am a little worried about Peeta and Katniss. I really like Gale but he is no Peeta. Once again Suzanne Collins has written a story that pulls the reader in and creates a permanent connection with the characters.<br /><br />[...].
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink explores the third dimension of profit - Productivity.  Those who understand that the first two dimensions (gross margin and expense control) only get you so far with ROI, will find that Pink's \\"I-Drive\\" (Intrinsic Motivation) is the real Pandora's Box  for businesses.  Untapping creativity is the least-obvious of the three dimensions. But Pink has dug into the research that business managers just don't read to unveil the truth about what motivates us; then he translates the academics into pragmatic strategies for talent management. I expect that this third dimension will get a lot more attention because of \\"DRiVE\\". It's way overdue and way underrated.
0439023483|5.0|So after putting this series off for a far too long I finally decided it was time to read The Hunger Games. Let me tell you I am kicking myself for not starting it sooner. The bright side is that the second book is already out and the third is close at hand so I won't have to wait to finish this series. If you are looking for a book with a strong female heroin, edge of your seat suspense, or an emotional rollercoaster then this is the book for you. I have not cried from reading a book in a while (mostly because I steer clear of the tear jerker genre in general) but this one had me turning on the waterworks.     Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister (Prim) in the poorest district of Panem, District 12. Panem is what remains of the United States. Panem was once thirteen districts and a capital, but after an uprising nearly 75 years ago only 12 districts remain. The war that the district raged on the capital all those years ago is how the Capital has justified the creation of \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Each year, ever one of the remaining twelve districts must send one boy and one girl to compete in the televised event where they are forced to fight to the death. Only one will be allowed to survive.     The reaping (like a lottery) is a dreaded event by everyone in the district but it is especially troubling for Katniss because this is the first year that her little sister's name will be in the running. When Prim is chosen, Katniss steps forward to take her place. Now Katniss along with Peeta are swept away to represent District 12 in the 74th annual Hunger Games.    I am a twilight fan so in the spirit of the Twilight mania going on in the world I am totally team Peeta! I <3 Gale but Peeta...swoon! ;)     [...]

1416955070|5.0|Clarissa Fray \\"Clary\\" is expecting a typical night out with her best friend Simon when she heads to the Pandemonium Club. Clary certainly was not expecting to witness a murder, but she can't deny that the strangest part about the situation is that no one else can see them but her. Clary is quickly thrown into a world that she never knew existed, where Shadowhunters are responsible for ridding the earth of demons. Jace, Isabelle, and Alec are Shadowhunters and they are just as surprised as Clary that she can see them. After all Clary is just a mundane human right?    When Clary's mother is taken and Clary is attacked by a Ravener demon it is Jace who saves her and brings her back to the Institute. It becomes evident that Clary is not a \\"mundie\\" and her mother has been hiding more then she could have imagined. Now Clary, Jace, Isabelle, Alec, and Simon all have there part to play in the search for the Mortal Cup, Jocelyn Fray, and the truth.    I must admit that I was not happy about how a few things turned out (If you have read this you know exactly what I am referring to), but I am confident that it will turn out to be false. *clasps hands and prays \\"Dear God don't let it be true\\"* Other then that little glitch I absolutely loved this book. It has a lot going on so it is almost impossible to put down. In fact as soon as I finished the last page I headed straight to the bookshelf to grab \\"City of Ashes.\\" I think my favorite character is Jace and not just because he is gorgeous. You can tell that he cares about Clary a lot as the story progresses but based on the hints to his background it is apparent that he has been conditioned to view love as a weakness. He fights his feelings and hides behind is cocky attitude to keep from being hurt (think about the falcon story).    To be honest I think that all the characters are really well developed within this series. The reader is really able to climb into their heads and understand why they are the way they are. Like so many other books this one was recommended to me a long time ago and I kept pushing it back. I really regret not reading this sooner.     [...]

But there were several places in the book that were tedious and contradictory.<br />Omitting the writing flaws and tedious sections .... I did like the book.<br /><br />By the time I reached the middle of the book, \\"it felt\\" like the author created two stories at separate times.

B001HN69AY|3.0|Having just watched Imaginarium for the first time today, I can see why this film has a polarizing effect on Gilliam fans.  I am a Gilliam fan and will defend his work all day, but this film...I don't know.  Let's get one thing out of the way right now, and I don't mean to disrespect the dead, but Heath Ledger does not bring his A-game to this movie.  He shows apparent signs of what eventually killed him.  He's rather sluggish and doesn't have enough screen time to really delve deep into character.  Even had he survived, this role would not be one that I would point to as a career highlight.  I guess others are seeing something in his performance that I am completely missing.  Perhaps because I walked into this film as more of a Gilliam fan instead of being a Ledger fan, I can be a bit more objective in criticizing.  And I realized the problem as soon as Ledger walked through the mirror for the first time.  That this movie would've been that much better had Johnny Depp played the role of Tony.  He's would've been perfect for the mysterious charming con-man and as soon as he comes on, you realize that here's someone who's healthy with a clear mind who could've brought some real meat to the role.  Depp could play that Jack Sparrow/Ed Wood enthusiasm and the role would be that much better  Jude Law and Colin Farrell are also excellent in the role and I could've seen either of them in the movie for the duration as well.  And frankly they outshine Ledger at every turn.      And I'm not bashing Ledger.  To compare I watched The Brothers Grimm in which Gilliam also directed Ledger and it is night and day in comparison.  In that film Ledger is firing on all cylinders and grabs his role with pleasure and relish.  And just 3 years later we see the same man in his last role, in which to add insult to injury, three other actors outshine the man in his own last film.  I don't know if Gilliam even should have completed the film in the first place.  Besides the obvious macabre boxoffice attraction of seeing someone who died during the production.  The whole effort is shadowed by tragedy and a curious absence of humor which, either dark or light, always has shown up in previous Gilliam features; Tideland perhaps being an exception.  It is not like the screen was crackling with acting magic when Ledger was on screen.  His shots all seemed like fillers that would have to be reshot later with pick-ups because the scenes in the film don't justify the praise.  And despite the always enjoyable Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits, the film just can't lift off the ground.  Even Verne Troyer is good in this film.  The visuals are all right, but Gilliam has produced better as well.  By far Gilliam's weakest effort and here's to hoping that his Don Quixote project gets up and running soon.
0061537969|3.0|I've long wondered what dogs think about. Now I know!   :  )     I found this book to be generally enjoyable.... about average human beings trying to live their own life... with main characters easy to care about and like. This story is light reading and somewhat predictable - but still it was fun to read the thoughts and words that the authored attributed to Enzo the dog who narrates the story. Stein is obviously tuned into the nature of dogs and t'is true indeed that dogs do key into the emotions of humans around them. I have yet to see a companion dog not respond to the tears of someone crying in their presence.     I'm personally not much of a car racing fan - yet I was willing to gain a bit of insight into this sporting arena and appreciated the author's sublime knowledge of it.     The final turn of the story on the last page or two... made me smile. This book makes for pleasant summer reading.

B000W02TDO|3.0|It's not in a fancy box. It has an extra record in it which includes \\"Making The Black Parade\\" which I don't really care about. So I'm sending it back and getting the record that's $30+ less instead.     I haven't heard the album, so I can't really comment on the quality of the music or anything. I got it for my girlfriend. She thinks it's awesome.
0441003257|5.0|With an absent divine Power relying on the bidding of his erstwhile and fallible minions, how could the Apocalypse have gone any better?   The scenario? God and Satan's dirty work didn't quite go as planned when both discover that their servants have taken too much of a liking to the gray areas surrounding the human condition, deciding to switch the Antichrist for a normal human baby.   With a satirical edge read through a distinctly British lens, Good Omens by the already controversial authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman will have you rolling as it explores the concepts of divine intervention, humanity's faults, and traditional religious dogma...as long as you don't take your own faith too seriously.  No one character is good or evil during this hats off dedication to the exploration of religion as a product of the human condition.   If you can handle the dry wit, black humor, and at times, slow pace, this novel is definitely one that will provide you with some worthwhile brain candy.

0891419063|5.0|I was first inspired to read this book after watching HBO's Series \\"The Pacific\\", which had Gene Sledge as one of its focal characters.  Although the series and the book cover much of the same material and experiences, the book is still definitely worth reading.  \\"With the Old Breed\\" is an amazingly well-written personal account of an enlisted Marine's experiences during the carnage of battle for control of Pacific islands.<br /><br />This book is so well-written that most should be able to finish it in a few hours.  Sledge writes in a very honest, personal style, which makes his experiences appear much more genuine than many other accounts.  He does not attempt to glorify the USA, war, the Marines, or himself, but simply tells it like it was.  His accounts of the true personal privations during combat, as well as the horrible suffering during the war differ greatly from most histories which are very matter of fact and focus on generalities, while ignoring what the individual felt and experienced.  His accounts of interactions with other servicemembers, as well as the Japanese, are also very fascinating.<br /><br />As this book was written as a personal narrative, I would not recommend the book if you are looking for a detailed history of the Pacific battles.  Sledge does not go into great detail describing the campaigns.  But if you are interested in WWII history, the US Marine Corps, or just generally would like to know more about what servicemembers went through during the Pacific campaigns of WWII, I highly recommend this book.
0307454541|5.0|Excellent Book and couldn't put it down. Package of books came sooner than estimated and in very good condition.
1932100660|5.0|This book was an incredible read. I have purchased several copies for other people so that they may learn of the possibilities for their own health and recovery through the dietary information presented in this book. The authors give very clear and well substantiated documentation for the findings. This is a very important book, making clear many very important points in a very accessible and easy to follow book that gives you the technical information and cites all of the various studies' history WITHOUT beating you to death with inconsequential ranting, or any unfounded conjecture.     I was surprised that with such a strong case, the authors resisted any indulgence in speculation or assumption. They simply pointed to an incredible body of evidence from a vast number of global research studies, as well as personal first hand experience in many years of technical research and in high ranking positions in the machinations of government panels and research boards.     It was really amazing how involved T. Colin Campbelll has been in the processes of research and various scientific boards over the decades.
B000IOM0WY|1.0|I enjoyed this movie, but the quality of this Blu-ray release is just awful.  It was so bad in some spots that it became a distraction from the movie itself.  I would recommend holding off until it is remastered.
B0000009SM|5.0|This album is one of the zappa best records, compare too best band u ever heard, anyway the wind blows, etc. this album has the best inca roads version, although I have too many FZ cd's because I love his music an been a fan ever sense I was a teenager at late 1990s anyway one of my parents loved him an thats how I knew about him.    K enuff life story, but on the live cd's every song never exactly sounds the same where they 1st came out on studio versons.     Most of todays music suck, but I think zappa is alot better than all the lame bands like Linkin Park, Coldplay, Slipknot, Briteny Spears, etc, an all the main stream soo called popular bands that everybody likes.      Dweezil zappa is albums are alright but I thnik he should do his own style of music not cover songs like zappa plays zappa.    Anyway if you like instrumentals music an music that has good lyrics in it then check out zappa.    Half of zappa songs are no words music(instrumental)    Anyway dinah moe humm, dont eat that yellow snow, grandwa zoo, eat that question, oh no, black napkins, when yuppies go to hell, my guitar wants too kill your mama, disco boy, and so on..    If your a zappa fan, an hate all todays cheesy country, rap, hip hop(2pac, ja rule, jay z, etdc.  ), etc. then get this cd as part of your collection, lol
B003A4IFGY|1.0|Maybe I'm spoiled having grown up with the best of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.From their first album on Shelter Records, they have been part of a soundtrack in my life. Sure, I didn't care as much for some of their later songs and I guess that I'd just write that off to having a harder time finding fresh inspiration to bring ...again and again.<br /><br />Mojo, sounds a bit like a loose jam band. Sure they have their chops but ...huh...what to play. Gone are the three minute rockers. Gone are the songs that grab you and make you want to play them over and over! Welcome to a new era. Call it, cruising on reputation... Oh, and their Greatest Hits.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|This was a fantastic movie that really captures the heart of the tragedy that is the war in Iraq part two.  I was disturbed and reminded by the facts that led America into an unnecessary war.  I think the movie studio's money was well spent creating such a gripping picture.  This movie should have been marketed as both a political and action thriller flick based on a true story that is quickly being forgotten after a decade of bloodshed.    Jason Bourne in Iraq speaking the truth about America's horrific mistakes.
0061914177|4.0|After having this book recommended to me time and again (and being wowed by Gary's energy in speeches), I decided to see what the hype's all about.  I think this is a good book in general, just not so great for me.    Before going into the subject matter, I have to say I was disappointed by the book's size.  Though it's a hardback, it's a very small one - closer in size to a trade paperback.  It's a quick read at less than 150 pages long, with large-ish type (including one page that only has one word on it).  After all the hype touting this as a magnum opus, I was definitely expecting more weight.    Crush It! has a lot to say about the power of social media, and leveraging that power to build Internet businesses (based on your personal passions) capable of making you round-the-clock money.  Sounds great, right?  It is!  If you're willing to work incredibly hard, and be human while you're doing it, you can go far.  Even if the thing you love most in life is swimming pool pH levels or knitting tail cozies for your dog, you can make a living at it.    If you're already running a blog and/or using other forms of social media on a regular basis, this may not be the book for you.  This book provides a great introduction to how Twitter, Facebook and YouTube (among others) can be used to project your personality and passion into multiple formats, but you should know how to do these things if you use those platforms already.  You won't get any \\"social networking secrets,\\" just common sense advice on how to be your passionate self.  If you aren't quite sure where to start, Crush It! provides an easy-to-follow roadmap that I can pretty much guarantee will show you spectacular results if you follow it closely.  The suggestions are smart, just geared to slightly behind me on the learning curve.    Even if your experience in blogging and social media is beyond the entry-level instructions in Crush It!, there are still some valuable portions of this book for you.  First and foremost, Gary's trademark passion still translates in print.  Reading the story of how he came to the United States, his family's work ethic, and his early ventures into entrepreneurship show that he's truly doing what he was born to do.  I also found the book inspirational, as it gave me lots of ideas about how to streamline several things I already had going on.      Despite its drawbacks, I'd still recommend this as something to read.  If you're already on the road to probloggerdom, it may be less valuable for you - but you're still bound to find something useful in Crush It!

B000UOOT1W|4.0|Imagine what a CD titled Ultimate Michael Jackson that only contains 7 songs from his Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad albums, and the remaining 12 or so songs from his History and Invincible albums. As much as I love Santana, this CD is kind of a strange collection with much of his older songs not included in favor of his newer albums, including two versions of Game of Love. I much preferred the older Santana during his peak in the early 70s with Evil Ways and Oye Como Va, and it does include his absolute most famous older songs such as those and Black Magic Woman, but also leaves much to be desired. His newer songs are good, but some of them are nowhere near the level of expertise and professionalism and soul as his earlier songs. If you are more of a fan of his newer songs, this album might appeal to you, and you do get a few of his old songs, but if you are a fan of Santana's 70s hits, this CD will only disappointed you. I recommend passing this CD up to get a compiliation album of his older material, and then buying his newer albums if you like his new style and updated sound. Of course you still get kind of a jazzy/soulful sound with his newer stuff, but its nowhere near as groundbreaking as his older stuff, and I can't stress that enough. This is still a good album, but it just is a very odd compilation, that includes more of his less desirable stuff, and less of his absolute best.

B0036EH3X4|4.0|What could have been a legendary \\"5 Star\\" Series was simply crushed by a flimsy final season. Really, I should have rated it \\"3 Stars\\" for the lackluster \\"wrap up\\" of the storyline -  but I am a bit more lenient though, and would go for \\"4\\" Stars, only because they did keep one strong theme through the Series - summed up as \\"Just let it go Jack\\", which started in season 1 and continues up until the very last scene; I happen to relate to that theme a lot in many ways, so it did speak to me on a level more than most \\"others\\" (sorry, couldn't resist...).    Anyhow, to answer some peoples questions about all the \\"unanswered\\" questions:  #1] The writers/producers (etc) have more than once flat-out admitted the first season was just \\"throwing stuff against the wall, to see what sticks\\". Meaning some things were simply dropped from the plot for whatever reason, and will never be answered - never.  #2] Remember the Season 4 \\"re-tool\\"? Well THAT is when they completely altered much of the plot \\"arc\\". Up until Season 4, there were many intriguing plot aspects that bordered on Sci-Fi; unfortunately, with the rating plunge and subsequent re-writing, they created a simplified storyline that was easier to understand for J6P - and delved more into the \\"Soap Opera\\" aspect to lure the inherent female demographic who were there simply to see the \\"hunks\\".    Bottom Line: The show was ruined by Studio Executives during Season 4. It was a situation of \\"Dumb-Down the show for the simple-minded proletariat, or get canceled\\". As usual, it's all about the Money...
0399156577|3.0|Not being a dog lover, I thought at first that I would not like this book at all.  However, I learned a lot about dogs  and dog training.   As for the rest of the story, it left a lot to be desired.  Too many loose ends not tied up.  Why was the mother brought into the story when we never got to meet her?  Who was leaking information to the reporter?  If we ever found out, I missed it.  All in all, a pretty decent vacation read, but not with Nora's usual attention to detail.  Less time on graphic love scenes and more time on the everyday facts of life, please.  For a long book, it ended too abruptly with too many unanswered questions.
B001QERPDO|5.0|This cd is amazing i recommend it to anyone and everyone. Breakeven and before the worst are my 2 favorite songs on this album. Im litterally addicted to it I listen to it all the time. I cant get enough of it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have
B002XMGGK6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I think Gerard Butler did a great job, similar to Hopkins characterization of Lechter, showing just hints of emotional reaction (except when faking it).  Maybe a mad man, maybe not.  Foxx did a good job with his role as well.    I don't want to say too much, and don't read on if you haven't seen this film.  It's exciting, it's worth seeing, I personally was disappointed a bit by the ending . . . you might love it.    Towards the end, I was disappointed by the sudden 'breakdown' of cleverness, and the lack of backup alternatives, from an otherwise ingenious individual (maybe he just couldn't foresee even a single problem, but that didn't seem likely, given his intellectual abilities).  I would have loved a more 'Silence of the Lambs' like ending, with a bit more growth from Foxx's character (everyone around him seemed to be learning from the devastation . . . what was his problem?).    Still, I enjoyed watching this, and it kept me rivetted until very close to the end.  I think it's worth trying if you haven't seen it.  I suspect there are many who will enjoy the ending as well.

Shiver keeps you on the edge of your seat and Maggie Steifvater really knows how to tug on a readers heartstrings. I don't normally cry when I read a book or watch a movie but parts of this book allows you a good cry with a satisfying end. The author even in the sequel can still get you to be balling on the couch as you are reading. I would and have recommended this book to many of my friends and would tell anyone loving any supernatural romance or just romance at all to read it. If you haven't read it you have no idea of what you are missing. I read for the first time just over a year ago and I still keep it near my bed and have reread it multiple times. I can't get enough!
0307454541|5.0|Thoroughtly enjoyable.  Once it takes off it is a thrilling run to the end.
B002ZDOXLW|4.0|Loreena McKennit, although Canadian, has the Irish faerie voice down pat.  She combines Enya with Middle Eastern influences and comes up with some of the most dream inducing melodies.  I ordered \\"An Ancient Muse\\" and \\"Buddha Bar XII\\" [[ASIN:B0037Z3D9U Vol. 12-Buddha-Bar]]from ImportCDs, who delivered this and other purchases quickly and on time.  It's always wonderful to have that kind of service.
1458978672|1.0|Buyer, beware.  The paperback version of this book is only 158 pages.  It is entitled \\"The Complete Works of Shakespeare\\", but in reality it is only one play.  I would have never spent $20.00 on just one play.  I should have looked more closely at the number of pages before purchasing it.  I also should have looked more closely at the reviews and noted they were written for the hardcover version which is over 1000 pages.
B00004SVIK|3.0|Okay, I admit that I got really excited by the GoldBox price...  and how it says it's the \\"Deluxe Limited Edition\\"...  and that it offered SO much more in this edition,    BUT!    They REALLY need to emphasize more that this is NOT a DVD.  Also, as CD set with MERELY a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" book, it does not offer anything more than you can get online from almost any Pink Floyd fansite.  The CD itself is not much to rave about either.    So, in conclusion:  I admit that I am NOT a fan of \\"live\\" performances.  I am a purist.  I love the sound of the ORIGINAL songs, not the enhanced-to-give-the-people-a-different-experience style.  However, I was willing to give this a shot.  If it weren't for the good price from GoldBox, I'd be returning it.  I already own the audio CD.    Well, I'm off to enjoy the words and pictures of a great concert through the eyes of a photographer while I listen to a mere CD of live music.
0143038419|4.0|There are things within our modern, ambitious world that do not provide heartfelt happiness and are lacking as froth is to soap. The author, in this book, tries to figure that out. It is a search for happiness.     I found this book to be an eye opener in some sorts and decided to visit an Ashram in US itself. This one is tucked in farmlands of New Mexico. The real thing that intrigued about this ashram was that it is a Sikh Ashram/Temple run by American white Sikhs. So they understand the reason for stalemate. And I thank this book for pushing me through to search for that solace.
1401323820|5.0|I thought I would get a silly book based on a great series and I confess I`ve purchased it just to have a Castle item. Although the book is very good, the story is strong and it keeps you reading. I totally aproved it and I`m very excited and looking foward to the release of the second one. I am Brazilian and teach english in a course. I used lots of passages from the vocabulary from the book to teach new words to my students! [[ASIN:1401310400 Heat Wave]]
B002VKB0M4|5.0|Truly does for Paris what Woody Allen did for Manhattan, plus it has the incredible, the iconic, the amazing Juliette Binoche!  I viewed the film as an homage a Juliette the first time. The second time I viewed it for the neighborhoods and scenes of Paris.  And on my third-plus viewing, I keep going back to the joyous dance scenes - from  Fabrice Luchini doing moves to old Motown to a sweetly seductive strip tease from a bundled up Mme. Binoche - and totally delighting in the innocence of it all. If you enjoy movies with lots of heart, great visuals and cameos from the stars, this is for you, from Paris with love.
0307454541|5.0|Developed slowly and fully.Got to a point that I could not put it down till the end .Be sure to read the trilogy in order.Loved ALL the characters.Looking forward to seeing the Swedish version of the movie.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I am really enjoying this.  It's a real education for me. I can't stop watching. However, I am so disappointed that there are no subtitles.  Either because of Sir Laurence Olivier's accent or the German, French or other foreign names etc, I keep trying to turn on the subtitles to understand what's being said.  Other than that, fantastic set.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|'Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief' is the kind of film young boys between the ages of 8 and 12 will go absolutely crazy for. I know I would have if I were still somewhere within those age parameters (some would say I still am but that's another matter). Yes I suppose some girls will enjoy the movie as well however it's generally boys that become absorbed in ancient myths and legends. Just think of it, Olympus and the Gods along with minotaurs, satyrs, centaurs Medusa, furies and many other divine and semi-divine beings exploding to life on the television screen. Great stuff if you're willing to accept good special effects and ignore the rather tepid story-line and particularly horrendous dialogue.<br /><br />Another negative was the rather uninspiring acting abounding in this film. Yes the cast was attractive and did include a number of well known actors and actresses but there rolls where small and little more than cameo appearances. The lead roles were held by the younger members of the cast in the roles of sons and daughters of the Elder Olympian deities. These youthful demi-gods were likable enough but unfortunately their performances just didn't succeed in breathing life into their desired to be bigger than life personas.<br /><br />Bottom line, much of the story simply didn't work. After all is said and done; the monsters slain, the quest completed and the mystery solved the audience is left with a rather trite day of dysfunctional deities who are too busy quarreling amongst themselves to participate in any form of parental care or guidance to the next generation of demi-gods. Ah..., it appears the arcane axiom \\"As Above, So Below\\" applies to so many things.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Movie is pretty good. Definitly a Guy Ritchie Holmes.     The blu ray has great video and audio, this is one of the blu-rays I would put on to show someone the difference between dvds and blu-ray. Also great are the new Star Trek, Avatar, and Ice Age 3.
B001IAOEXU|3.0|I needed a couple more dollars to get free shipping and found these. They do fit snug on the original L2 and R2 buttons but I find they do sometimes get in the way...maybe from them being angled out too much or myself not being used to the new design. It sure is better than the finger sliding of the button and missing the kill in return.
0739384171|5.0|REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK PRODUCT<br /><br />Simon Vance again keeps the story flowing, engaging and animated.  There are, at one point, over eight active characters in this book (I can't spell any of the names because I'm listening to the book not reading it but here goes: Michael, Salander, Erika, The Freelance Journalist Writing The Sex Trade Expose Book, The Criminologist Writing the Sex Trade Expose Thesis, Mariam Wu, Salander's former Guardian who had a stroke, Salander's sicko current Guardian, Armanski, the paranoid blonde giant) and Simon Vance gives EACH character his or her on voice and the voice sound authentic.  The female voices don't sound forced at all.  Their pitch and their flow seems totally in line with the character.  Vance is reading a book about Swedes in Swedish society in English and has decided to use English accents to delineate the characters (which is smart because I wouldn't know an \\"Uptown\\" Swedish accent from a \\"ghetto\\" Swedish accent but I can tell cockney from the King's English).  Even Salander's stroke victim former guardian sounds totally authentic.  I thought for sure Simon Vance doing a disabled person would sound forced but I was wrong.<br /><br />The CDs when ripped to Itunes have only minor problems.  The \\"Album\\" tag field for each CD is The Girl Who Played With Fire (DISC X), where X represents the CD number (1-15).  So if you want your digital media player to recognize all 15 CDs as being part of the same compilation you have to erase the \\"(DISC X)\\" from all the tags and you have to mark  the compilation box in all the tags.  When you get above CD 10 sometimes the actual Artist Name is also The Girl Who Played With Fire instead of Steig Larsson.  I'll come back later and review the actual book/story/writing/ when I'm finished listening.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|I'm 48-years-old and I refuse to \\"get lost in a decade\\" vis-a-vis music. I know too many people who are stuck in a certain decade of music, usually the decade they went to high school. I love discovering new bands, new sounds and I enjoy it so much I'm willing to listen to a LOT of bad music to find those gems. This is absolutely one of those gems. Most people mention track two, Desire Be Desire Go  or track six, Solitude Is Bliss as the standouts, and they are good, but track one, It's Not Meant To Be is the true masterpiece. As other has said, Tame Impala sounds like they are channeling Lennon &agrave; la Sergent Pepper, and that's true, but they also incorporate a healthy dose of Tears For Fears and more obscure names like Kula Shaker, who had an EP called Summer Sun (Tame Impala had an EP called Modular Recordings with a single called \\"Sundown Syndrome\\"). This album is sonic heroin, stick it in and get high.
B002AS466O|2.0|Shane Black (and Joel Silver too) can really dish up the overdone cheese, never more so than this oddly well-remembered big-budget piece of trash. Some here call it overly violent, misogynistic, etc etc. And that it may be, though I've seen many worse in both those categories. But rarely have I seen a film that tries so hard to be hip and aloof while also being so ham-handed and just plain bad.<br /><br />Willis is the only vaguely decent thing here. Wayans is a laughable actor, and their characters are way overdrawn and given so much pointless backstory...for what? This tries to be Chandler and fails so miserably as to be a joke.  Good noir is tight and sinewy; this is 80s-looking glitz that goes too far in every direction, with endless insipid dialogue that tries to be Hammett/Chandler witty but instead just drivels on like an especially bad Miami Vice episode.<br /><br />Which this kind of looks like, actually. Tony Scott made it all slick, but it also looks fake and posed, and the violence is so b-movie badly done that I don't see how it could offend. This makes Die Hard look like Citizen Kane. And the plot isn't even interesting, a lame pastiche of sports gambling, blackmail, and corrupt politicians that's both thoroughly ridiculous and monotonously predictable, veering into sheer idiocy by the end.<br /><br />All in all this is one of the most over-rated, over-written, over-produced pieces of trying-too-hardness that I've ever seen. They paid 1.75 mil for this script?! Chandler would gag.
B0035G5IOE|1.0|By reading the reviews, is appeared I would be getting a wonderful evening movie. The reviews on the box were so great! I gave it a chance and watched or about 40 minutes, and what a disappointment. Poor story line and poor graphics. Boring characters. See if you can find a preview first. You might like it! My copy is on its way to The Salvation Army.
B00004Y6NP|3.0|This is not the best album by Dire Straits - if that is what you're looking for, buy their self-titled debut recording.  Brothers In Arms had three great songs (the first three), one pretty good song (The Man's Too Strong) and the rest is filler IMHO.  I know many like the title cut, but it does nothing for me.    My biggest question is \\"Why the need to remaster?\\"  When this album was released, it was touted as one of the first fully digital recordings.  Wouldn't that eliminate the need for remastering?  At best, they could remix the sound and/or boost the volume.  I do not consider this remastering.  I will stick with my original CD version unless someone can convince me otherwise.
B001DD63UO|5.0|Being a big fan of Pink, but I only buy her edited editions due to the language. Her voice is rich and amazing and I think that she is one of the great talents of the day, This was one of her best ever. I am 66 years old and love her music! Again, as long as it is edited.
0321334876|5.0|This book is a good summary of many C++ details. Well written and could be understood easily.
B00006B1HH|2.0|Very cheesy & trite \\"formula\\" musical about a good girl who tries to fit in with the \\"cool crowd\\" that smokes, drinks, drag races and gets in fights.  Olivia Newton-John's vocals and Travolta's dancing are the saving grace in this film, as well as the endearing performance by Didi Conn as \\"Frenchie.\\"   But that's as good as it gets as far as casting; the rest of the actors are in no way believable as high school teenagers.  Poor Stockhard Channing looks miserable throughout the film, in a role that is clearly beneath her.  Somehow it lends to the perceived tough chick attitude of her character.      To fans of the musical:  you'll be disappointed too, as so much of this has changed from the original to Highlight the talents of the actors of the time.  Even Travolta looks too old to play his role, and it is unbelievable that anybody knew how to disco in 1952.      What is most disappointing is the message that \\"too nicey-nice\\" is a bad thing, and you have to change and be more \\"morally gray\\" to fit in.      ...the music is pretty lame, but in a funny way.
B000UAE7RW|4.0|Great storyline and fine acting. The way the story twists and turns through-out and gradually changes track from a political scandal to catching a ruthlessly evil old man is extremely well intertwined.    ** Spoilers:  I had trouble getting into JN's character. He toned down the overacting to such an extent that I found his character rather bland. Brilliant that he spends half the movie wearing a stupid looking bandage on his nose, and still gets the girl.    The ending:  So RP sets us up to believe that they are going to escape to Mexico, but in reality she heroine gets shot and probably dies, her father wins ... Ok, that's a nice unexpected cruel twist to the end, but what did happen to their ride to Mexico? Why were they riding in their car knowing that anyone could find them (and of course everyone did)? Why would a police officer fire live ammunition at a car containing an innocent young girl in the middle of a crowded street in Chinatown? Did he go to prison? The end, (nicely unexpected as it was) was too inconsistent.    Once everyone arrives at Chinatown, you can skip the end .. you're not going to like it anyway.
0307463745|5.0|This book is a treasure trove of common sense (as if sense were that common these days) business advice for the beginner in business and for the old pro who has been around the block.  I must say it was a very fast read with more of illustrations to make the various points and abbreviated stories/advice snippets.  It was great and I'm sure I will read it again to get the full flavor of the various points.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Fleet Foxes are a great band. They make beautiful music and have a wonderful talent. Good album to own. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B000I5Y9G8|5.0|This is my personal favorite. It is raw, naked and powerful emotion. The music is simple and very melodic written to highlight his powerful words of anger and resentment.     \\"It seems there is not an ounce of trust or love anywhere in this world\\". ....\\"When they kick you in the guts as your hand holds out the pearl, it seems there is nothing but hate and lust everywhere in the world\\". (Autumn)    This may not be the best introduction to this amazing artist but I can't imagine it won't strike a deep chord.
0060730552|4.0|I am an avid fan of mountaineering books and as such Touching the Void is almost required reading.  However, I think it appeals to a much broader audience.      The background of the story puts Joe Simpson and Simon Yates trying to be the first to climb a particular route on a mountain called Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes.  As is so often the case in the mountains, nature and circumstance consipre to kill those trying to conquer them.  Both men are put into absurd situations and are forced to make choices that were both cruel and necessary.  The facts of the story are remarkable.    Joe Simpson takes great pains to tell the story from all angles.  He avoids a lot of hyperbole preferring to tell what happened in fairly simple terms.  This is a quick read and is very accessible to readers unfamiliar with the confusing language of mountaineering.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I've owned a pair of Skullcandy Com TI Multimedia headphones for about 3 years now. They've always done well for me, despite not being a top of the line headset. I've used them for music, movies, video chatting, and in game communication. They broke last week.<br /><br />I was tempted to simply order a new pair, but These Plantronics caught my eye. I decided to give it a shot. Here are some impressions.<br /><br />The Fit:<br />They're a bit wider than I'm used to with a slightly tighter hold on the head than I'm used to. Not uncomfortable, just...noticeable. I'm confident this will fade with use. The gap inside the ear cup is roomy, and the circumaural padding is soft and comfortable. It seems to be covered in a microfiber of sorts which is pleasing to the touch, but do trap some more heat than may be comfortable. (I recommend removing these every hour or so, just to let your ears breathe a bit.) They headset can expand to accommodate what I can only imagine to be heads of cartoonish proportions, so sizing should not be an issue at all. The mic slides out and can bend a bit for suitable placement.<br /><br />The Look:<br />Aesthetically, they're damn cool. Matte black with a translucent red color scheme, the hideaway mic...it looks good, undeniably so. The square cups give it a vaguely futuristic look, which may be a plus for some. Frankly, it makes little difference to me, but there it is anyway.<br /><br />The Sound:<br />The bass is a bit flat at first listen, but not to a point where it makes a listening experience any less enjoyable. It handles voice very well, on both counts. People sound fine on say, skype or world of warcraft, and your voice is equally audible to people on the receiving end.<br /><br />The Build:<br />The headset seems well made, from top to bottom. The cushions seem fairly durable, the plastic does not bend or stress in any way, the mic boom seems well built and the cord is fairly resilient. The in-line volume control and mute switch also seem to be well made, although the volume control seems a bit...unbalanced. (The volume change from 1 to 2 is much greater than the volume change from 2-3 or 3-4. Volume setting 2 seems to be more than adequate, at any rate. My only gripe is that the plugs are not color coded for mic and audio.a bit...unbalanced. (The volume change from 1 to 2 is much greater than the volume change from 2-3 or 3-4.

1844256383|5.0|This elegant package works at any level.  I would've bought it for the visual thread of photos taking the user through maintenance/repairs, but as it turns out the backstory of saxophones is interesting and informative in its own right, and the repair steps are clearly and thoroughly stated.  A cornerstone for anyone who loves and cares for a saxophone of any type.
B00005JLZN|4.0|It's interesting to read the reviews of this movie. The right-wing, death penalty advocates generally hated it, those who favor abolition thought it was great. What I'd say, just considering it as a movie, is that it was well-acted, moved along quickly and contained enough misdirection to make it enjoyable to speculate on what was finally going to happen. In fact, the point of the final twist seems to have been missed by many of the reviewers.  Of course, a movie is going to change no-one's mind about the death penalty. Just put your prejudices aside and enjoy it for what it is.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a charming view of modern Japan and illuminates the many cultural changes in Japanese Society. Having lived there in the 60s, I can see that the evolution in thinking continues since WWII. However, the politeness and sweetness of this island people remains firm even though they have endured the war and after a period of economic growth, a downturn in their economy that has lasted for over a decade. Their values remain strong even though they have been influenced by western music and ideas. The characters in this film are not only likeable, but loveable in many ways. Many will appreciate the subtlety of the film and the character development. It is a feel good film with many lessons for today's generation.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|I love the Gilmore Girls and I love the set.  It is in adorable packaging, BUT....<br />if you buy this be very careful.  I had several DVDs in the first set I got that would not play or seemed to have nothing on them.  There are seven seasons to go through and by the time you hit a bad dvd, it may be six months down the line.  The second set I was shipped when I returned the first had the same problem on different discs. I am on my THIRD set now!  We had to watch the DVDs as fast as we could, to make sure they work properly so they could be returned if I had to.<br /><br />I must say Amazon has been great in just shipping me a whole new set each time at no charge, but I have to wrap up the old one and drop it off at the UPS store to send it back. Return shipping was free, but still a hassle.  Then you have a whole new set that you need to check all the DVDs that you already watched in the first set!  Not fun...<br />Great show, I am a huge fan, but I think this was very bad manufacturing of the actual DVDs.  There is a really cute episode guide included along with another book of \\"Gilmorisms\\" and we love the set, just be aware of this problem if you want to purchase it.
B001974DG0|5.0|This was my second Dean Koontz read (after _The Darkest Evening of the Year_), and I really enjoyed it. The characters are well-developed, with the stand-out being the dog, Einstein. If you have ever had a dog, you will really connect with this wonderful character. The Outsider provides the requisite chills, while also eliciting sympathy, due to the Frankenstein's monster-ish aspect to it. I found myself thinking about the story and characters long after I finished. I'm not sure I want to read another Koontz book now, because I am afraid that after this, anything else will be disappointing.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This set is huge. The price here is off too, [...] has it for [...] with free shipping. Even that is a lot for a lego set, but this has a little of everything. It took me around 12-15 hours. I don't know for sure because I spent a lot of time between two days building it and taking breaks between. Either way it took the good part of two days to build.<br />The set is sturdy and designed very well for being so large. It was not missing any pieces or missing any instructions. The instructions are huge as well and they come as a ring binder.<br />My son loves all the figures that come with the set, and this set has a lot of cool features and things like the prison opens up and connects to the trash room. They do things like that in this set which is cool.<br />I have been a fan of Lego and Star Wars and this set is awesome. Building it was more of a chore, but the end result is very cool. My son loves playing with it, and all of the minifigs that it comes with.
0316066524|1.0|I tried, but I just couldn't get into this story at all. It makes Twin Peaks look straightforward and simple, but wihtout any of the charm and quirkiness of that show. I regret buying
B001EN71DG|5.0|This is a great set, It comes with 6 discs which have the original movies and redone version of the movies. The digital remakes are good quality picture. The original films show in a very small window on the TV and are grainy and not that great of quality, but it is the original version - what do you expect from the late 70s and early 80s. Either way it is a nice set because they include the original movies.<br />I am not holding out for any blu ray version... how much better can they get the quality from movies that were filmed 30 years ago. The digital remasters are good enough for me in that case, they look decent on the TV and I don't really need to see Luke Skywalker's arm hair (that's a blu ray joke). Anyway, This set is well worth the price if you are a Star Wars fan. They come in thin dvd cases so the whole set does not take up that much room.
B00005QGAT|4.0|I love MJ, but I acknowledge in advance that I am of the \\"Thriller\\" generation (being born in 1980), and so I am probably biased (music-wise). Comparing this to \\"Thriller\\" is something I almost loathe to do, knowing I will likely irritate some people. But because they're quite different and the closest in chronological order for him as solo albums, I think it's the best I can do. This was a tad grittier, MJ was a little more outgoing on certain numbers here & he was a more of a risk-taker on \\"Off the Wall\\". There is a rather moderate disco element here, and MJ probably had the foresight to not make it an out-and-out album of that genre. Hence, why it's aged so well, as has all of his music. Some songs from this are must-haves for me- and some of it is almost grating to my ears. I just don't care for them- it's purely personal preference, so please understand, it's not an attack on Michael or anyone else who performed on the album.<br /><br />I wish they played tracks from this album more in the clubs, and it should be better known to the younger crowd. Had I been old enough to appreciate it, I probably would have really dug \\"Rock With You\\", \\"Workin' Day and Night\\" & \\"She's Out of My Life\\", and would have made great memories to them. Don't get me wrong. There are some real standouts on here. Certainly, the title track is one. Same with \\"Get on the Floor\\", which is my favorite track on the entire album. I listen to those two songs almost daily. \\"Off the Wall\\" is an album where you need to listen to the songs in full, so you can get the feel for what you personally like best. Michael (I'm sure purposely, considering his genius) started with a good hook on all of his tracks, but knew to let the song slowly come to a dynamic climax of various chords, his own harmony and melody tracks, sparingly using back-up singers countered w/ plenty of interesting instrumentation, layering it all gradually until you just want to burst out of your seat and dance. He was a magician weaving a spell of song, and a real master he was. Then he'd let the tracks wind down just a bit until the end, but he somehow alwayss left you craving more. \\"Off the Wall\\" is a track which has a phenomenal final minute and \\"Get on the Floor\\" has a middle section bound to impress the most disco-jaded of all listeners. This is feel-good music at it's best. Even MJ'S disco-heavy pieces, though, are more timeless and high-quality than nearly all of the era's music. MJ was a musical prophet in many ways. He blended the best of the late 70's musical technology with a sound unlike anything ever recorded before- and gave us all a glimpse of the bright future ahead. For that, this album has my respect, if not my complete adoration. \\"She's Out of My Life\\" was a beautiful serenade, if a bit contrived. MJ, at this stage in his life, sounded just a little too forced emotionally on this sad love song. The dance songs were where he seemed more comfortable, and those were the tracks that shined for me.<br /><br />I only started listening to this album seriously in the last year or so, despite listening to MJ for thirty years w/o stopping. Had I listened to this before hearing the music of Justin Timberlake (who especially comes off as a copycat boy to me now, after listening to this), Britney Spears or really...virtually every dance, R&B or pop artist/group who recorded after 1979, I would have realized that everything they did, Michael had already done first- and he did it better (either solo, with The Jackson Five or The Jacksons). He was the ultimate musical trailblazer, even more than Madonna or any other artist before or since, which even the most anti-MJ person has to grudgingly admit. The bonuses to me were boring & unneeded- they did the same thing with the re-release of Thriller. Neither are special editions which are must-haves, but again, that is sheer personal preference.<br /><br />Listen to the whole album and judge for yourself. I will say it was a marvel of quality & was made w/ obviously immense care, as was MJ's entire body of work. Even at it's worst, it was still pretty darn good. And the magnificent tracks make up for the lesser ones (much like other great artists- I'm thinking Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, etc.)mmense care, as was MJ's entire body of work.

B001US29I2|5.0|This is a great set, I have not had any issues with the stability of this set. Although I don't pick it up and hold it upside-down. The set has a lot of cool figures and it has cool features, like the walls popping off when exploding the base, and the sliding doors. My son plays with this set a lot and it's never fallen apart so I'm not sure what all these reviews are of this thing falling apart.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I purchased these Sony Headphones to use with an MP3 player on daily walks. The \\"in ear\\" type of design looked ideal for hot weather use - leaving the ear uncovered and cooler. However, because of the very light almost elastic construction I found the \\"seal\\" between the headphone and my ear felt loose and the sound quality suffered to some  degree. Obviously, this is a subjective situation; others could find the fit perfect. They are certainly a comfortable headset and as light weight as you can get.
0380973839|5.0|Lofty topics are covered here, within these pages. I would urge, you the reader, to think about the cultural climate at which time this book was written. What is masterful about Bradbury's art is that the highly political issues of civil rights, atomic war, etc. are not so much in the forefront as some of the other readers have led you to believe. The main question of this book, as it is and was with NASA space program is \\"what of the colonization of mars?\\" So, there is your task, what is your answer, how do you feel? It is interesting to see where Bradbury's characters end in the grand scheme of things. If you are unsettled by nondescript fanciful creations, let the book unravel some more, don't put it down.

044022425X|4.0|As far as Outlander novels go, Drums of Autumn  is the most bodice-ripperish out of the 4 I've read so far. Mainly, because the entire book is plotted around a MISUNDERSTANDING that could have been resolved with one adult conversation. Oh, how I hate those in romance novels!<br /><br />Here is how it goes. In this installment Claire and Jamie are in America establishing a Scottish colony in North Carolina, of course not without a fair share of difficulties and misfortunes. Two hundred years into future Brianna discovers information that forces her to risk her life and travel back in time in secret to visit her parents and possibly change their destiny. Roger, Brianna's fiancee, follows her and the couple immediately consummate their relationship. A mix-up concerning Roger's identity (specifically, his last name) is what drives the main conflict of this novel. This tiny misunderstanding leads to a series of pretty dramatic events.<br /><br />It's not a secret that while Diana Gabaldon is a great storyteller, she is a weak plotter. She admits so herself, saying that she assembles her book as a puzzle, first writing separate scenes and then piecing them together with a plot. Thus very often her plots are overridden with very unlikely coincidences and sometimes deus ex machina. Drums of Autumn is no exception, but here the entire misunderstanding twist is just way overdone and makes some characters (particularly, to my chagrin, Jamie) act like complete idiots.<br /><br />Another hot button issue for me is this: does every character in the Outlander series have to get raped at some point? There is a new addition to the list of Lord John, Jamie, Claire, and Fergus. I mean, enough already with the sexual abuse! I am sure even 200 years ago not everyone was assaulted, right?<br /><br />Brianna and Roger's relationship is given a lot of screen time in this book. Not sure if I care for these two much and believe in their love. Brianna is a pretty unlikable, spoiled, rash person and a source of almost all misfortunes in the story. And poor Roger. He has to go through a lot of pain and suffering for his love.<br /><br />And the last complaint. For a book of this length (1070 pages!) and with such an extensive use of words like \\"virgin\\" and \\"maidenhead,\\" Drums of Autumn is definitely very light on sex.<br /><br />You might ask why with all these problems I am giving this novel 4 stars? Well, like I said, Gabaldon is a great storyteller. She is so wordy, so descriptive, so in love with the scenes she writes, so self-indulgent to the point, I think, that she doesn't edit out any of her own writing, and yet I am ready to read anything she writes. There is just an addictive, cracktastick quality to her stories. I love being taken on adventure and Gabaldon does just that. I will undoubtedly read the next book, regardless of rapes, deus ex machinas and contrived plots. But can Jamie be not such a possessive dumb-ass in The Fiery Cross though? Pretty please?on and a source of almost all misfortunes in the story. And poor Roger. He has to go through a lot of pain and suffering for his love.<br /><br />And the last complaint.

030726999X|5.0|How can one improve on something that is already outstanding and a phenomenon? By reading the third in Larsson's trilogy. This book is the book that ties everything together and leaves you wanting more. The ending is not what you expect and as you read with bated breath, you experience a myriad of feelings. You want to read the conclusion to find out what is going to happen....yet - strangely you find yourself reluctant to read the end as it means exactly that. The end. You are relieved, excited, and happy to reach the ending only to discover that the sadness sets it soon thereafter. No more Mikael. No more Lisbeth. No more. Never.
B0024FAG5I|5.0|Bought as a gift for my Husband, he already had just the DVD.  He loves having it and BluRay is fantastic!!!
030745455X|5.0|Very rarely do we enjoy a sequel to a very good book. Larsson has defied all odds and done something very few writers has mastered. He has made the second book even more exciting than the first. As you read this book, you will hold your breath as you can't imagine what comes next.<br />A must read!!
B00006JDVV|5.0|awesome movie!!! dragon hunters ruuule!!!!!! great movie, great buy, fast shipping, the universe is awesome!!! and turkeys are fun when unexpectedly spotted while trail running!!!!
0307454541|5.0|Wow!! We have lost an incredible writer with Stieg Larsson's passing. This is one of the best trilogies I have read in a very long time. He captures the world of espionage, intrigue, love and sex in a very unique, suspenseful and spellbinding manner. His central characters Mikael and Lisbeth are unforgettable characters that become your friends. They stay ingrained in your mind even after you have read the book. Upon concluding the book, I felt that I had lost two very good friends.<br />Larsoon has the uncanny ability to draw you into a surreal world and make it seem as if the life you are living is unreal.<br />Totally captivating. A must read for fans of suspense and intrigue. He has cooked it up with a huge serving of excitement,heaping spoons full of intrigue served liberally with unadulterated, stay up well into the night, must read one page or I will die addiction.<br />Really a phenomenon.
067144901X|5.0|Sandra Boynton is a name you should become familiar with. Her books are fantastic gems. Moo Baa La La La is a wonderful \\"animal sound\\" book with a funny surprise in the middle.    You'll go through the sounds for such animals as: cows, sheep, pigs, ducks, horses, rhinoceroses, dogs, and cats.    It's funny to hear adults read this book. As they get to the part of what the rhino's say, our brains aren't quite sure if rhinoceroses is the correct word or if we should say something like \\"rhinocerosi\\".    And hearing the different types of \\"snorting and snuffing\\" brings down the house. Be sure to have grandma and grandpa read this to your little one so you, too, can have a blast.    You won't find any audio or texture features in this book but your child will enjoy growing up with this easy-to-read and echo book.
1582701709|1.0|God help anyone who can believe this rubbish. When we belch or break wind we set up a vibration.  Do we not have to be careful  to set up the right vibrations in this way if we are trying to attract success? Trying to change your life by visualisation is like drawing a moustache on the mirror and expecting it to show up on your face.
030726999X|2.0|It was Ok is the best I can do for this, because that is the truth, unless you are familiar with Sweden - then I could see someone giving it 4 stars. There was just too much of Sweden in this one (names, streets, businesses, politics). I think one could start reading on page 439, Chapter 24, and be fine. The first 400+ pages are mostly tedious reading, going over what has been already established - there are a lot of awful men in the world & the Authority is mostly incompetent. Our heroine, Lisbeth Salander is on her back recovering from gunshots wounds for most of the story - thus no story. The characters flatten out ... the tale told. On page 514 Larsson sums up: \\" ... this story in not primarily about spies and secret government agencies; it's about violence against women, and the men who enable it.\\" Well, he established that in books 1 & 2; but the first 438 pages of this book is about just that - the secondary story. Where he was going is more interesting ... how will Salander and Blomkvist make out? Will they both, or one, overcome their fear of intimacy? Too bad he died. Will we ever know if it's possible to overcome early childhood abuse ...
6305428050|4.0|It was a great film, the DVD was sent before I expected it @ my home. I would recommend this film, It's  hilarious!
B003E88TKS|2.0|Wanted to rent a comedy, I like George Clooney, what happened? This was make me want to jump off a bridge depressing. Their jobs are sad, their lives are worse and it has a an unpredictable ending that isn't what you want to walk out of a comedy with.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|As usual Enigma does their great blend of mystical sounds.  Great for meditation  purposes, in my opinion.  Quite uplifting to listen to during those down days that we all experience from time to time.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|The only reason I bought this movie is because I love the old one so much and the guy that reviewed it for Amazon said this was one case where the new out did the old. Guess he likes really crappy movies. I was done with remakes, they always have to change the story line, for the worse. Examples: Planet of the Apes, Time Machine, and lets not forget how they destroyed The Day the Earth Stood Still! Anyway, it jumped all over the place. I guess Hollywood thinks that if thet throw in a lot of special effects we will watch anything. Please, please, please, if anyone from Hollywood is reading this, please don't touch Forbidden Planet, you have destroyed enough of the old classic Sci-Fi's, leave well enough alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002B1M|3.0|This is one of Nas's best albums....his lyrics will once again over shine the beats and it will take u to places in my opinion Illmatic dont. Tracks like \\" I gave u power\\" and \\"The message\\" will show u that Nas is in a class with very few. Other tracks like \\" Shootouts\\" and \\" black girl lost\\" will have u in deep story mode. Bottomline It was written, shows the gritty, lyrical based era of the 90's and it also shows Nas's ability to deliver when needed.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is another album I bought on Amazon I haven't received in the mail yet but I am reviewing it because I bought a digital copy of this on Napster, too, 2 years ago. Yes, I am a passionate Britney fan. Ok, here we go. As short and concise as possible. I rate every single song 10/10. This is a side of Britney I'd never seen before, a more mature Britney, her dark side even, and I love that. Listening to these songs puts me in a trance, a good trance, and I enjoy it from beginning to end. I can't wait for Britney's new studio album. Just when you think she can't possibly get any better, and she's the best, she does get a 1000 times better with every album. I love Britney.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I was a big fan of \\"Liar's Poker\\" when it came out 20+ years ago.  I worked in the S&L industry at the time, and that book was an accurate depiction of the downfall of that industry.  So when I saw \\"The Big Short,\\" I bought it for my Kindle.<br /><br />Like Liar's Poker, The Big Short is by no means an easy read.  There are a lot of financial terms. Having spent 20 years in banking (10 in mortgages), I understood the technical aspects of it.  However, with no financial background, you may have a bit of a learning curve.<br /><br />That said, this book really ticked me off.  We as a country apparently learned nothing with the S&L debacle of the 80's.  Wall Street has run amuck again, and this time, the whole country has taken a beating as a result.  The greed, the arrogance and the lack of intelligent oversight is absolutely terrifying.  Anyone working in the industry could see the collapse coming.  But the driving force which allowed the unchecked greed to take over was the US Congress.  The push to put anybody and everybody into a house allowed for the loans and the derivatives which caused the country's economic collapse.<br /><br />This was an excellently researched and written book.  I can't say I enjoyed it because it made me too angry.  However, I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to understand what happened and why it happened.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am not going to make this review very long because I am sleepy and my back hurts, but all I'm going to say is that I adore this album and every single track is 10/10. Never skip. Britney did a great job. Definitely one of her best albums.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|If you liked \\"Hellboy,\\" you'll also like \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army.\\"  As sequels go, this is neither worse nor better than the first in the series, which says a lot for Guillermo del Toro as screenwriter and director.  Just as you might watch a good TV series and expect one episode to be on par with all the others with regard to style, story and execution, the same holds true for the two Hellboy movies.<br /><br />I won't rehash the story, but point out that most of the original cast is present here along with a few newcomers.  The creature effects are excellent.
B00004SCX6|5.0|And because of the five stars I just gave the album, I definitely don't mean that in a bad way. This seems to be, rather than Britney's second album, it seems to be the fourth or fifth because it's so. Much. Better. Songs are apt for a girl her age at the time, but her lyrics on this album are very mature and \\"Dear Diary\\" makes me think I'm listening to the diary of a ten-year-old-girl, but that is not a bad thing. It's good actually. It reminds me of how I felt about every single crush I had when I was younger. \\"Oops, I Did It Again\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\", \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\\", \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", \\"What You See Is What You Get\\" and \\"Lucky\\" are the best tracks, although I listen to all of the every time I play the CD. Great album. Britney's a true artist, no matter what anyone else says.
1423113497|4.0|The title is just meant to be sarcastic, I know there's a movie and I saw it, but when reading the book it felt as if the movie wasn't even based on it. The movie hacked up the book and dumbed it down to be a totally kid friendly movie. While the book is full of non-stop action and twisted and scary villains that weren't even included in the movie!<br /><br />  The Madusa scene in the movie is too much like Clash of the Titans, her part is a little longer in the book and I found it funny that she ran her own lunch in where she cooks for people and then turns them into stone. That wasn't in the movie, in the movie she just chases Percy and his friends as soon as they get to her place pretty much. The movie is okay, but it made the book look bad, when it's actually an excellent book that could have made a great movie. Even if you saw the movie, I recommend reading the book. I saw the movie first and I'm glad I read the book because it's an excellent read and blows the movie away!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Let me start by saying I adore this album so much I recently purchased my THIRD copy. The first one, I couldn't stop listening to it, and the disc got damaged. The second one, I moved to Puerto Rico from Florida unexpectedly and I have no idea what happened to it. The third one, I have it right here, and if I lost it, and if I lost any Britney album again, I would buy it again. All the songs are 10/10. Lovely rhythms, lovely lyrics, \\"Slave\\" is very racy, Britney's raciest song since \\"Baby One More Time\\". I love that. Never skip a track. Amazing album.
9056912445|2.0|John Donaldson is quoted on the back cover:  \\"De La Villa does the job quite well.\\"  Maybe John and I would disagree whether it is \\"quite\\" well or  \\"almost\\" well, but we do agree that it is not \\"really\\" well.  When you have so many choices, why buy (or publish, I have to wonder) a book that isn't \\"really\\" good?!    The first sign of problems is early on, when the author takes pains to tell us how the importance of the opposition is overrated, but never gives a clear definition of what the opposition is!  (I know what it is, but how is this supposed to help someone who is learning K+P endings for the first time?!)    This book has a lot of words.  I'd hoped that the explanations would be more insightful or more memorable than those I've seen elsewhere, but that's not the case.  It's just another run of the mill endgame book - in no way superior to those you might already own.    I'm sorry I believed the reviews and wasted money on this.  Much better would have been to stick to doing the blue diagrams in [[ASIN:1888690283 Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual]].  If you don't already own it, that's the book to buy.
B000G759LW|5.0|I love 1930's/1940's Christina!! Once again I daresay that there is nothing in this world that this woman can't sing! She actually made me want to be born in the 1930's or 1940's to enjoy this music. Who knew that someone born in 1981 would adore this music? I have never met anyone my age who listens to this genre of music, but I love it, and like I said before, Christina makes it even better. I listen to this album at least once a week because I don't want my CD to get damage and I always enjoy it from beginning to end, never skipping a track. Obviously all these songs are 10/10, and although I didn't suffer abuse from my father or any other father figure, because my father died when I was 6 and only my grandma raised me, Oh Mother makes me cry. Mrs. Kearns and Christina did not deserve that. They were always great people. I love Christina.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I love Kelly, and I loved her albums before listening to this one because I bought CD's by Kelly years before, right here on Amazon, and although this album is not better than \\"Breakaway\\", my favorite Kelly album, it is just as good. Every single song on this album is PERFECT. Nuff said.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Ponyo (which is also known as Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  For this film, Miyazaki chose to make a completely 2D film, and not utilize any 3D computer effects.  This approach gives Ponyo a very distinct feel when compared to some of the more recent films that have been produced by Studio Ghibli.  However, I believe that the simplicity of the animation really works well with the story being told in the film.  Ponyo is a very family-friendly film, and can be enjoyed by both younger and older viewers alike.<br /><br />There is one bonus feature on the first DVD, which is a roughly three-minute documentary titled, \\"Disc Introduction - Meet Ponyo.\\"  This documentary features Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, who were involved with producing the English dub of the film.<br /><br />The second disc in the set has a set up menu as well, which allows you to choose between English and Japanese audio.  The features are split into two sections: \\"Original Japanese Storyboards\\" and \\"The World of Ghibli.\\"  Just like on Disney's previous releases of Studio Ghibli films, the \\"Original Japanese Storyboards\\" is simply a version of the film with storyboards.<br /><br />The menu for \\"The World of Ghibli\\" is split into two sections: \\"Behind the Studio\\" and \\"Other Ghibli Worlds Preview.\\"  It starts out with five documentaries, which run anywhere from 2-5 minutes, discussing various aspects of producing Ponyo (and some also briefly touch on some of Miyazaki's other works).  These subtitled documentaries feature either Hayao Miyazaki or Toshio Suzuki (the producer).  This is followed by a nine-and-a-half minute excerpt from a Japanese documentary about where Ponyo is set.  This is followed by a roughly eight-minute documentary about how Joe Hiashi scored some of Miyazaki's films.  Then, there are the original Japanese trailers (which are two trailers that run for three-and-a-half minutes).  The final feature in this menu is \\"Behind the Microphone,\\" a six-minute long documentary about recording the English dub of Ponyo.<br /><br />The \\"Other Ghibli Worlds Preview\\" has sections for My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Castle in the Sky.  Each one has a short documentary featuring Miyazaki.<br /><br />On this disc, there is also \\"Enter the Lands.\\"  In the menu for this feature, there are elements from all of Studio Ghibli's films, but only elements for Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, and Castle in the Sky can be selected.

B0002IQOZA|5.0|I love every single track on this album. All tracks are rated 10/10. As if listening to a traditional American Christmas song didn't bring enough joy on Christmas, Christina's powerhouse voice makes it so much better! I am glad that Christina made a Christmas album. There is nothing in this world, no kind of material that Mrs. Bratman can't sing. After all, she can sing the phonebook and still sell it as a record.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I was first introduced to Inception during a five-minute preview before the showing of Sherlock Holmes (2009) and was mildly intrigued by the snippets that were presented in the teaser trailer. Basically, I assumed the film would be another Prestige (2006) and came to the conclusion that Ken Watanabe was a 'magician' of some sort and was involved in 21st century espionage (among other things) and that Leonardo DiCaprio was assigned to hunting him down. Of course, when I heard that the film was about invading the subconscious of the dreamer and stealing or implanting ideas in the mind, I wondered how the hell that would turn out. So, on a rather spur of the moment my family and I decided to see this film and went off to the theaters.    Sufficed to say, I enjoyed this movie and found it to be one of the simplest films Nolan has directed since Batman Begins (or even Insomnia) despite his efforts to confuse his audience with his ideals and opinions of how the mind works when a person is asleep and dreaming.    The story, simply put is this:    Inception follows the tale of Dominic Cobb and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), thieves for hire sent to steal an ideal from a man called Saito (Ken Watanabe). When their job is botched by the sudden, but not unexpected, appearance of Dominic's deceased wife, Mal (which, for whatever reason, is pronounced like \\"Maul\\"), they plan to lie low for awhile until the incoming heat from the man they were hired by blows over. Instead, Saito reappears and offers Dominic a deal he can't refuse: The chance to return to Stateside and be reunited with his children, whom he 'abandoned' when proper authorities decided to label him as his wife's killer. All he has to do is infiltrate the mind of a man who is on his way to controlling the the most powerful energy conglomerate in the world and convince him to dissolve his dying father's company via \\"Inception\\" (the ability to implant an idea into the mind of a dreamer and have them believe the idea was theirs). Despite Arthur's reservations towards the job, naturally, Dominic says yes and assembles a motley crew of former/new associates and one young college student named Ariadne (Ellen Page) who steps in to become their \\"architect\\" (a person who creates a dream scape to fool a dreamer into believing their in the real world and not dreaming) and prays the job gets done without a hitch. Naturally, it doesn't and when the group find themselves stuck in their target's mind (with one of their own mortally wounded) with no possible way of escaping, they bite the bullet and decide to go through with the plan in hopes of escaping back to reality.    What follows afterward is Christopher Nolan's \\"How to traverse a Streamlined Subconscious 101 during a botched mission\\" with a combination of your typical action/adventure summer fare. And such a description is not to say that the film was terrible. On the contrary, it was a very composed film and did it's job well. However, in concerns to the dream scape universe presented in the film, I'm afraid that was far too simple and not at all like a dream. While Inception's initial (and obvious) inspiration may have come from \\"[[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix (1999)]]\\" --- a film that does a superb job of playing with the themes of dreams vs. reality and bending said reality ---, it truly fails on that level to capture the same sort of surreal atmosphere. Dreams are nonsensical and jagged at best and therefore, cannot be as normal as they were presented in this film. But I suppose for the sake of coherency, it had to be. And while the idea is hinted a lot at in the film, there is never a moment in the film where the characters ever question their reality (outside of that one sequence with Ellen Page in the beginning), whether or not they are dreaming, it's just mentioned alot.    That aside, a lot of people have said \\"You'll need to see this film a couple times to truly understand it\\" and that's simply not the case (at least not forme anyways). As mentioned before, this is one of Nolan's simpler films. It doesn't mean to surprise like [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins]] or [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]] did in 2005 and 2006, but it does test your level of patience and dedication to it's storyline with it's length, much like [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]] did in 2008. This film, like TDK, is a half-hour too long and really needed to be trimmed down.    Another downside is that, while the performances in the film were great, a few of the characters are, perhaps, too monotone for their good. With the exceptions of Ellen Page's Ariadne (who, next to Joseph Gordon Levitt, is the highlight of the film with her everyman character), Tom Hardy's Eames (who's character can be characterized as that \\"smart-arse Brit with a mind for deception, 'Sherlock Holmes'-esque disguises, a taste gambling and fast women\\") and Cillian Murphy and Dileep Rao, who's characters are as human as they can be in a Nolan film, actors like DiCaprio, Watanabe, Levitt and Marion Cotillard (who plays Mal) have characters that could easily be exchanged between them because their devoid of any real personality outside of \\"serious business\\" (welll, maybe not Cotillard).     DiCaprio's Dominic is simply defined by the loss of his wife and the need to return home to his children, outside of that there isn't much to him beyond that broodish facade. It pulls on the heartstrings to be sure, but it's not a character I became particularity attached to or concerned about. Levitt's Arthur, as smooth and likable as he is, is just another straight-faced character, brilliantly realized within the context of his ability to act with so little and one of the best action sequences I've seen in a long time (he also steals every sequence he appears in).    The special effects waver between rather telling (folding the city on top of itself, the limbo level) and near seamless, action sequences are gripping and brilliantly choreographed (The Zero-Gravity fight on the second dream level). Hans Zimmer's score, while not his best in the least, takes a cue from Sherlock Holmes (with a touch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 See: \\"Mombasa\\") and manages to be both different from his usual soundtrack and suits the atmosphere of the film as well.    Overall, I loved the ideas and most of the execution presented in this film. Inception manages to be somewhat original with it's premise and will without a doubt dazzle audiences for its two and half hour stay on the Silver Screen. --- [A 4 out of 5]
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ok, this album, from the first track to the last, is autobiographical, literally, and I adore that. Her voice in these songs is incredible and as always she hits notes that I've never heard before. She puts so much passion into each song that it sounds like she's crying throughout each and every song. I thank Christina for releasing an album like this and letting us into her life, letting us know what she's been through. The songs that I identify with are \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" because I hate society's double standards when it comes to the sexuality of men and women, \\"Stripped Intro\\" (Not part 2!!!) \\"Fighter\\", because I've been stabbed in the back several times by several people, \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Make Over\\", \\"Cruz\\", \\"Soar\\", \\"The Voice Within\\" and \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\". Actually, every time I listen to \\"Beautiful\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Soar\\" and \\"Keep on Singing My Song\\", and I am down or crying, these songs instantly lift me up, and when I feel ok, they make me feel so much better about myself. I love this album. The songs I didn't mention, I don't identify with at all because they don't have anything to do with my life, but they are great songs and I still listen to them. Every song is 10/10 and every aspect of this album is incredible. Christina only gives her fans the best she has, and that is why I love her.
0143118420|5.0|The only reason why I bought this book is due to the hype surrounding the movie. I would see this book in the book store and never took an interest because the corny cover and cheesy name turned me off. But, there have been a ton of articles lately on this book, and once I got on here and read the reviews + the description I was really interested. Travel and eastern religion interest me a lot so that was part of the appeal. I found that I really liked this book, and admire the author for dropping everything and finding herself. This is something I hope to do in the near future. I really don't understand the aversion that people have to taking the time to find themselves, do what they want to do and figure out there place in the universe. These same people say what a miracle life is, but do nothing to explore their own existence and consciousness. Yes, it is kind of selfish what she did, but why live a miserable existence for fear of being selfish? Heck, as I write this I'm planning to put this into action in my own life: you only live once, experience the world, find yourself, and find some inner peace.    I find it odd that so many women are on here saying that they didn't like the book because it was about some privileged woman, selfish, and no one will give them money to travel. Are you serious? First of all not every book can relate to everyone on the planet...that is why there is variety, something for everyone and obviously this book wasn't for you. And the people saying that all she did was talk about herself and whine, well, that is the point of an autobiography, especially one where someone is working through their personal issues. And why hate on her for finding a way to fund her travel though a book advance, again, if I could do that I would. With all that said, I greatly enjoyed this book, and got a little inspiration from it.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|All the tracks in this album are great. I can't say that enough times, but I ADORE Britney's version of Bobby Brown's \\"My Prerogative\\"!!! For starters, it is empowering to hear A WOMAN sing a song like this. It makes me feel that there's nothing men can do that we can't do also. This is MY personal anthem. My Prerogative. Thank you, Ms. Spears for re-releasing this song.      Do Something - Great song!    I've Just Begun having my Fun - Why didn't this track get released earlier?       GREAT \\"HITS\\" ALBUM!!
0143038419|2.0|Positives - Interesting idea, occasionally some beautiful writing, and a good title.  Some people seemed to love it, so I gave it shot.  Negatives - The author strikes me as one of those people who answer a casual \\"Hi, how are you?\\" with twenty minutes of telling you everything that's wrong in their life.  I know people like this - they're exhausting.  It's difficult to follow someone's journey when they're so self absorbed, yet never come to any sort of self discovery.    I can get being unhappy in a marriage, but was annoyed at her complaining about her ex not being as eager to split as she was.  She sobs over the marriage SHE decided to end, sobs over him not instantly giving her legal freedom (hello, she just upended his whole life!) and never for a moment sees it as anything more than how it all affected her.  She then runs right to another man, gets obsessed, pushes him away with her neediness, and then sobs over that too.  She acknowledges her mistakes, but it doesn't make them any less annoying, and she never seems to learn from them.  For all her traveling, this book had no sense of place.  She went to 3 fascinating places, but barely describes them to us - I don't need a travel guide, but set the mood a little at least.  Even the people she knows and meets aren't people with their own lives, just sounding boards for all of her problems, or a shoulder to sob yet again on.    I actually went to school in Rome for 4 months, and even with a full course load, feel I saw and experienced so much more of the city and country than she did and expressed in this book, with her wide open schedule.  She dismisses others' interest by saying she's more into finding the \\"story\\" of a place rather than seeing museums and monuments, but then never tells us that story.  I picture her walking through one of the most amazing cities in the world, looking at nothing but a mirror she holds in front of herself as she goes.  If it doesn't impact her or reflect her life directly, it's unimportant.  She studied with a guru for 2 years before this journey, knew all the lingo and the positions, knew the profound ideas - but still seemed to be an emotional mess, a self obsessed neurotic - her study came across to me as trendy rather than spiritualistic, and felt kind of cliche.  Her guru must have been happy for the break while she traveled.  I also found myself pitying the others in India, there seeking their own enlightenment, who got stuck listening to her whine about her boyfriend problems and her inability to shut her mind off.  Even her spiritual quest was all about how much God loves her.    She's a one way street, and it circles right back around to the beginning.    I wish the author had used her journey to truly experience these places in addition to just her own mind, to truly get to know people and see their lives and learn about her own from them.  If she DID in fact do that, I wish that's what she'd written about, as that would have been a great book to read, instead of all the me, me, me, I, I, I.  There is a big world out there beyond your own head!
006074815X|5.0|This is a short book, compared to a Tom Clancy or a Frederick Forsyth. However, while they produce truck bombs, this little book, in Follett's lethal steady  hand, can deliver devastation, like a hand grenade, or the tiny weapon used by the villain.  Your emotions are not spared at any time, and at no point must you, as with a Clancy novel, look up, take a deep breath and say \\"HUH?\\"  I read this book shortly after it came out, now reading it again 30 years later, this small powder keg has not grown damp with the passing years.

B002GJT4XW|4.0|Update : August 31 2010 : I received the new disks from Amazon and the audio issue has been resolved.    This is a review for the Blu Ray Disc Set and not the movie itself (which I have no problems with). The audio track for the main movie was defective and had an almost Headphone-ish feel to it. No sound from center and back speakers, and only sound from front left & right. Furthermore, there was no option (that I could readily find) to change the audio track so that I could troubleshoot the problem. Thankfully, Amazon has agreed to ship a replacement. Awaiting the replacement set and will update the review accordingly.   Note that other BD's work perfectly on my setup and only the main movie from this set had the problem.
0736092269|4.0|This book appeals to two types of persons at once: the bodybuilder (male and female) and the lover of art.  The anatomical precision of what goes on inside of the musculature as well as without is quite remarkable and stunning.  The drawings and the artwork are remarkable.<br /><br />Though the book goes into body building and strength training, it is not exhaustive, and it also doesn't cover that much on eating and diet.  If you love great art and if you love exercise and fitness, then this is the book for you.  I own it, and I love admiring the beautiful display of the internal anatomy.  I think that this indeed is a collector's item and belongs in any serious library on body building and weight training.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I absolutely love this product.  Fits on my umbrella stroller perfectly and I used it religiously.  Can't speak highly enough about it.  Get it, you won't regret it.
B005K8H8W0|5.0|One of the few albums I would give 5 stars to. I don’t know if this is quite perfect, but it certainly comes close!<br />You had to be there in 1993 to understand the whole meaning of this record. Grunge scene, punky attitude, alternative rock emerging, and in the middle of it all, one band does the ultimate crossover between dream pop and metal. I remember, at the time I heard Cherub Rock for the first time, thinking: what is this massive wall of gross! But among all the wailing guitars, was corgan’s delicate voice, singing like the song was a lullaby. At first, the album seemed very dense and hard to get into but, in retrospect, it was just because I wasn't used to this kind of music, and this album was the most densely constructed guitar music I had ever heard. And by densely I mean, like, a wall of 50 guitars with the fuzz turned to ten and multitracked to exhilarating results.<br />The opener is a statement of intentions: drumrolls and clean guitar riff that suddenly explodes into a sick version of the same riff, that suddenly gives way to the song’s glorious riff. If you have never heard the pumpkins before, this is the best place to start. Quiet, the next song, starts with some weird distortion sounds (I suppose it’s some guitar work played backwards) and then boom! A very dark riff  and one of the most difficult songs in the album, but also one of the most rewarding ones. The climax is astounding! Today is  Pumpkins classic and very poppy in nature. Still, the song showcases everything that made the pumpkins my favorite band back then: a hundred guitars doing tiny things, a really dense fuzzy base, over the top dynamics, and Corgan’s angelical voice. Hummer is the first epic of the album and sounds like a glorious explosion after a bad day. The guitar solos are among Corgan’s finest, by the way, and the outro is fascinating!<br />Rocket  is one of the singles, and pure psychedelia. The ending is nothing short of spectacular, I shall be free of these voices inside me!<br />And that’s just the beginning of the album. What comes next is equally as good, from the touching lyrics and bells of Disarm, or the epic gloriousness of the guitar solo in Soma,  to the amazing guitar and drums of Geek USA (with one of the best guitar/drums solos ever). Mayonaise is probably the best Smashing Pumpkins song ever (it’s my favorite song, by any band, ever, that’s for sure). Sweet sweet soothes you after the brutal Silverfuck, and luna closes the album on a quiet tone.<br /><br />Ok. I now got carried away and I am gonna say this is the best record ever, immaculate from start to finish! It’s daring, innovative, tender, harsh, dark and joyful and sounds like nothing else you have heard before. It also packs 6-7 of the 90’s best songs and is very consistent. What else could you need? Also, if you like guitars, this is one of the quintessential guitar tone albums. So much love was put into this, and it shows. Get this.
B0038P9LTU|5.0|8th studio album by power/neoclassical metal band \\"Rhapsody of fire\\"; `The frozen tears of angels' was my introduction to the music of the band (although I have followed the side careers Luca Turilli and Fabio Lione) which is indeed a very memorable album.<br /><br />What I found largely appealing on `The frozen tears of angels' is the fact that no instrument is obscured by any other; throughout `The frozen tears of angels', all five musicians take the opportunity to shine and their respective performances are equally important for the sound of the album.<br /><br />It has to be said however that the tempo plays in the two extremes for the biggest part of the album; it goes either incredibly fast or very slow while this switching often occurs halfway through the song. Still all instruments masterfully adapt to these variations; in fact Turilli throws in some of the fastest power metal riffs one has heard in a long time; Alex Staropoli's keyboards are more than ambitious contributing both rhythm and melodic sections.<br />Lione does a masterful job on the vocals, as always, still one might find it hard to follow the lyrics when sung choir-like at full speed (yet this also stands as a complement for the band's technical ability). Never forgetting Alex Holzwart who wages wars behind his drum set, while it often seems as his playing is actually leading the band through the song.<br /><br />Favourite songs include the dramatic `Sea of fate', the orchestral/neoclassical `Crystal Moonlight' and the extra melodic `Raging Starfire'.<br /><br />Furthermore placing Sasha Paeth on the mixing board was a clever move; having worked with multi-track project such as `Avantasia', Paeth in away stands as a guarantee that all instruments and voices will come clearly through the mix, displayed at similar volume.<br /><br />Any way you look at it, `The frozen tears of angels' is a heavy hitting power metal album; some of the fastest and most aggressive instrumentations are to be found on this release while also retaining the highest standards in terms of musicianship and production.<br /><br />\\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 305) marks this album with 7/10 commenting: \\"`Rhapsody of fire' are now focusing on speed and aggression which makes for a more guitar oriented sound.\\"highest standards in terms of musicianship and production.        \\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 305) marks this album with 7/10 commenting: \\"`Rhapsody of fire' are now focusing on speed and aggression which makes for a more guitar oriented sound.\\"
B000002KE2|5.0|If you are not conversant with Black Sabbath, it is not easy to tell which of their early tracks is from which early album. All of Sabbath's albums from 1970 to 1975 are essential for understanding early 70s sludge rock, or early metal.<br /><br />But there are subtle changes album to album. Each saw the music become a little heavier, more rock, less blues influenced. The tracks get more condensed, and as each album goes to the next, Sabbath sound a step closer to what we know as heavy metal.<br /><br />Vol 4. finds us in fine shape, making progress step by step towards metal blastdom. There is less emphasis here on open jamming, the riffs are harder  cut and the solos trimmed. All the 1960s, almost jazzy interludes on Sabbaths first two albums,[[ASIN:B000002KB8 Black Sabbath]] and [[ASIN:B000002KHH Paranoid]], are scaled back. Space gives way to chunk.<br /><br />There are two experiments here: The almost-ballad \\"Changes,\\"  and a strange and graceful instrumental \\"Laguna Sunrise.\\" Both are good, and provide variation.<br /><br />But the remainder of Vol. 4 in all its sharp metal invention is where the action is.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|This woman is talented.  I'm enamored with her.  There is not one bad track on this double album.  Soooo upbeat, Speechless is a real crooner's ballad.  So glad I bought this album, sorry I couldn't get to the concert.  Highly recommended.
1904633005|5.0|I have always loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works. This one did not disappoint! It is a fantastic tale with all the usual Austen humor and wittiness that work so well in her stories! In fact, it is now up there with \\"Sense\\" as my favorite Austen work!    \\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"    The first sentence in the novel really sets the stage for all the mistakes the main character makes throughout! This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.    This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the \\"lightest\\" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious \\"action\\" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the \\"elitist\\" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.    This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day.
0316017922|5.0|Three blocks from our office in Boston is the spot where Benjamin Franklin was born and played as a child.  Franklin is the American icon of the Self Made Man we so admire today.  His story is that those with ability and willingness to work hard can change the world.  Don't be defeated by humble origins, lack of money, or lack of education.<br />Beyond a threshold of innate ability, hard work may be more important.<br /> Author Malcom Gladwell argues that those who are successful put in at last 10,000 hours of practice into their art or craft.  He shows how the 10,000 hour rule applies for Mozart, the Beatles, and Bill Gates.<br />Gladwell also argues that there is more to success than ability and hard work.<br />There is cultural heritage.  In the case of Jewish and Chinese culture, it has provided a clear advantage in American society.<br />There are other random factors that contribute to success: what month you were born, what year you were born, whether your parents encouraged you to strive, whether your parents had money, etc.<br />From a Board of Directors perspective, it should caution those who get involved in CEO and Board selection not to be too infatuated with impressive resumes.  And not to overpay someone because he/she was smart enough to be born in a certain year or a certain month.<br />From a social policy perspective, this book gives hope that perhaps success is not about Great Men and Women.  There are positive factors that can be engineered to contribute to success.  The KIPP Academy,  discussed in the book, for example, takes poor urban children and makes them work as hard as Chinese Rice Farmers---with dramatically positive results.<br />And those of you whom society regards as \\"successful,\\" read this book and prepare to feel humbled.<br />Your success is the gift of cultural legacies you barely comprehend, accidents of birth, and random events you had the good sense to seize on.<br />One last comment: there is a chapter about Geert Hofstede's research on how culture shapes personality.  In particular, there is a full discussion about one dimension called Power Distance.  Those cultures with high Power Distance or respect for power tend to have more airline fatalities than cultures with low Power Distance.  It is a fascinating discussion.  But it also has implications for those of us concerned with quality control and ethics in business.  The steps an American CEO of Korean Airlines took to reduce Power Distance within his Korean employees are well worth reading.  Companies with operations in different parts of the world will find this chapter of greatest value.  What does it have to do with the book's basic theme of success?

1579126278|5.0|This review applies to the Audible unabridged edition. Robin Bailey reads this story with a hint of villianous egotism inside a sense of humor. As for AG's detection club claiming she didn't play fair with who she designated as the murderer, this is addressed in the film, \\"Murder by Death\\" by Neil Simon. In fact, she did play fair by allowing the reader (listener) to have almost every clue. Murder on the Orient Express is my favorite Christie film, but this audio version is my favorite.
0393072231|3.0|This book is not intended to be a comprehensive account of the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage bond market.  In interviews elsewhere, Michael Lewis has said that he wanted to take his readers along on a detective story, having them discover the nature and scale of the mess along with the characters he presents.  In this he succeeds, but it's important for the reader to remember that this narrative is highly shaped.  For instance, there is just a bare mention of David X. Li, the Chinese mathematician who devised the formula which Wall Street misused to fool themselves about the worth of the credit derivatives they traded in. The story of his Gaussian copula is a tale in itself.<br /><br />Also, since this is an anti-Wall Street morality tale, there is no discussion or even admission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's roles in causing and prolonging the crisis.  Just a brief comment about how both entities were swept up by the whirlwind. But most of his ire is well-targeted.  The only people who got rich from this mess are the ones who saw it coming, and the golden parachute equipped fat cats who caused it.  And even then the rule still obtains: at that level of the food chain, you don't get what you deserve.  You get what you negotiate.<br /><br />So taken on its own terms, the tale is entertaining and fairly informative.  The Asperger's maverick is an intriguing personality.  The trio of contrarians are less interesting, in part because they talk like tongue-tied Valley girls.  Nothing wrong with their investing acumen, though.  Especially damning is the portrayal of the Moody's and Standard & Poor's bond rating agencies as JC Penney clothed nine-to-fivers, out of their depth and adroitly rolled by the slick CDO peddlers.<br /><br />Lewis attempts to bring the book back full circle to Liars Poker by having lunch with his old boss, for no discernable reason.  A whim, maybe.  It doesn't really fit as the kicker for the book. He should have ended at the scene where he was people watching on Wall Street, musing over the fate of all those sleek traders as the economy crashed.Wall Street, musing over the fate of all those sleek traders as the economy crashed.

B0031SU2Y2|4.0|(thanks to Film Movement for providing me with a screener!)    I learned today that apparently in France it's actually illegal to offer aid to illegal immigrants. This is possibly illegal here in the USA, but I'll bet it's not enforced. In France, however, it seems like it is.    I learned this by watching Welcome, a film that in France ignited much debate about the laws against helping illegals. The movie tells the story of Bilal (the extremely attractive Firat Ayverdi), a seventeen-year-old Kurdish boy who wants to get to England to be with the girl he loves. When his first plan to go across the Channel inside a truck fails, he falls back onto another plan to swim across. He finds Simon (Vincent Lindon), a former Olympic gold medalist swimmer and starts taking lessons so that he can swim to England and be with the girl he loves.    Now I've written before on my blog about how insanely stupid teenage love is, and this is a great example. Here's this kid who thinks he's in love with this girl and is willing to risk his life to be with her. Some people consider this wonderful and romantic. Not I. He'd have been far better off staying in France, since the French state they have no plans to deport him back to Iraq and especially since there seems to be at least some chance of normalizing his status. But, no, he's young, stupid and willing to risk death. These kids today...    Of course had he stayed in France we wouldn't have had a movie, and what a good movie it is. We see the plight of illegals in France, something I'm fairly close to myself living in Arizona. We handle it poorly, but they really have raised their bad treatment of illegals to an art form. We also get some wonderful side-stories about Simon's life and his recent divorce, and much about the way the police treat and investigate the illegals.    It was quite clear that Philippe Lioret, the director, had a definite agenda and the movie does suffer somewhat on an artistic level because of it. As a result,the ending wasn't what I had hoped for, being a bit of a disappointment. It was more realistic than what I had wanted, but that doesn't mean I like it. It's a very good film and I'm glad I saw it.    == SHORT SUBJECT ==    This month's short film is called The Berlin Wall. It's about an older man whose wife dies. He goes a little iffy at that point and winds up building up a segment of a wall in a field near his apartment. Some neighbors are appalled, but others are all in favor of making it a real wall to keep out the immigrants nearby.    It was a bit of an odd film, but a good one. The acting was spot-on and it was fun to see an East German woman complaining about immigrants getting tax euros only to have a West German woman point out that the East Germans get most of their money from the west. It's a nice compliment to the feature film.
0618918248|2.0|So many people have been reading and talking about The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, so I finally decided to pick up a copy and read it (twice). While Dawkins is an engaging and entertaining writer, his arguments are surprisingly weak. It is clear that he is completely unaware of the revolution in philosophy of religion that has taken place over the past few decades. It's amazing to me that he could write a book against God and not deal with philosophers such as Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig, or J.P. Moreland. Maybe he knows of them and simply ignores them (just as he refuses to debate someone of the likes of Craig). Or maybe he really is unaware. I lean toward the former. The God Delusion may be compelling to those untrained in philosophy and apologetics. But those with a background can find a much more compelling read, such as Why I am Not A Christian by John Loftus.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|Like many other I also felt this season was a major let-down.  It really was a red herring, but that doesn't take away from all of the great times and memories I have from watching the series as a whole
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Got hooked on this show in the first season. Very entertaining and great acting and plot twists.
B002ZG9846|5.0|To anyone who hasn't seen the movie but is considering it, you should realize up front that this movie is NOT for the kiddies, as evidenced by the \\"R\\" rating.  That said, most of the bad reviews here seem to be from either people who had problems with the disc itself (i.e. people who don't understand the concept of a review), or people who let their kids watch the movie.  These people made a stupid decision involving the mental well-being of their children based on the fact that they've seen \\"R-Rated\\" movies in the past that they don't mind their kids watching.  This is not one of those movies!    Ranting aside, this was a pretty awesome movie.  If you like action movies, check it out.  It's a little darker, a little more violent, and a lot more vulgar than you might expect, but that's part of the movie's brilliance.  Hit Girl is one of the coolest characters to grace the big screen in years, the MistMobile is the hottest Mustang manufactured post-70's, and the narrative draws you right into a feeling of camaraderie with the characters almost immediately.    Check it out, this movie rocks!
0061564893|3.0|The book arrived in decent condition.  Delivery was a little slow.  Overall I am pleased.
0307266303|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book for a number of reasons.  Like the author I really enjoy running but seem to suffer from a number of minor ailments that keep me confined to about 10 miles per run.  I have likewise spent a lot of money on the best running shoes at a running specialty store, plus the additional arch supports, the GPS watch with a pacing feature, etc.  I found the science that he shared in his book to be fascinating, and now I am convinced I should just throw away my expensive shoes and try running 3 times a week on dewey grass to help build up my arches.  I was also totally intrigued by all of the data he uses to support his premise that running ultramarathons is what gave man such an evolutionary advantage, and also by his contention that there is a link between the love of running and the capacity to love in general.    He was able to present all of this scientific data intwined in an incredible story about a lost Indian tribe in the Mexican jungle so that you didn't get bored or feel like you were reading a college textbook.  Bravo!
B002HNA95E|4.0|We all know when it comes to artists who have had a lot of success, it's very difficult to put together a greatest hits compilation without leaving out some great songs. Unfortunately in this case I find it hard to overlook the absences of \\"Angel\\", \\"Deeper & Deeper\\" & 'Nothing Really Matters\\". Especially when songs like \\"4 Minutes\\", \\"Miles Away\\", \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Revolver\\" & \\"Justify My Love\\" made the cut, other than that it's a well put together compilation.
1595141715|5.0|When you start this book, be prepared to offer up the rest of your day. This is not a book to be read in short snippets, between having a life. This book will keep you occupied until you finish it.<br /><br />The book is told in alternating narratives, slapped right on top of each other: Hannah's, through the tapes, and Clays. They overlap, they comment on each other, and then twist around until the truth comes out. It's an amazing read.
B001290A30|5.0|This is the best burzum album ever made i think. its the way burzum was ment to sound like the album takes you on a journey through sorrow and sadness.all of the burzum albums are amazing and have a great sound to them but this just stands out alot. the opening track is very hypnotic its a 14 minute song it starts out with a very cold gloomy keyboard and icy guitar that goes on for many minutes then the drums come in and the main guitar riff starts up then blasts like thunder then then a mysterious keyboard sound comes in. the songs riffs reapeat afew times as the lead riff reapeats again then vargs tortured screams come out of nowhere. i may add that this song is one of burzums best songs it alone takes you on a journey it starts out dark and mysterious then towards the middle it breaks down to a sad mood as the sorrowful keyboards come in the and vargs vocals really fit the mood of this song aswell some people might not like his early vocals because there loud and he screams alot but for this song it fits... because the song is very sad in a way but the song does make you feel like your on a journey and as the outro guitar riff fades away you will feel like you just came from a dark sorrowful journey.some of the guitar riffs sound kinda like there in the background alot of this song you really follow the keyboards because they stand out alot really the lead guitar riff and the outro one are the only ones that stand out without the keyboards. then as the title song comes in i never really got into this song it just didn't sound that great compared to the other ones but thats just what i think but there are some good vocals in the song but not any keyboards can be heard on this one. then the next song Inn i slottet fra drommen comes next this is one of my favorite songs it starts out very brutal and stays that way to it get to the middle and the mood of the song really changes.the keyboards come in again and then you hear a low faded guitar riff then the vocals comein again and the the faded guitar riff breaks in at full force. this is my favorite riff of the song and the riff and drums really go together at this part then the song slows down for a couple of minutes before the last riff returns and a hypnotic keyboard comes into almost filling in for the guitar you really can't tell if the guitar is playing the riff or the keyboard but this part of the song almost puts you in a trance before going into the outro riff. this is another song that really makes you feel like your on a journey. then the last song comes on which is a instrumental ambient song that pretty much brings you to the end of your journey and the song is long but its very relaxing. but i think the things that stand out the most on this album would have to be the vocals keyboards and guitars there are no other burzum albums that sound like this which makes this a special album varg himself has even said this was the golden age of burzum and had even said once that it was his favorite album. the album has only four songs but the way the first and last songs are so long it makes the album feel longer but this album has great guitar riffs as every burzum album does and the keyboards are very well played and there very moody. anyone who likes burzum i would recommend this and if your just getting into burzum this i would say would be a good album to get along with the debut and Det some engang var if you are just looking for a good black metal album that have keyboards this would be the best burzum album to get i think.
B000LVFDOG|4.0|A little cheesy after all these years, but a nice, clean TV show that the kids can enjoy without all the foul language seen in modern sitcoms.  Honor in the main character is nice, a change from today's \\"heroes\\" that are just foul-mouthed and filthy-minded.
0375842209|5.0|I was surprised by the caliber of the writing and the love and death mixture of Nazi Germany and the hate towards the Jewish population. It is not a sentimental story but a very human one. Good way for young people to learn about the Holocaust. D.I.
1582701709|5.0|The secret really taps into what youve known all along but seemed to just dismiss as happen stance. Its a great read and will have staying up all night to try and read more. I love the examples in the book of how other people have benefitted from knowing the secret. I practice the secret myself and i am a much happier person. I recommend this book for those who are really \\"go getters\\" in life;, and for all those who feel that there is nothing that they can do the change their current circumstances and future situations in life.
073935275X|5.0|If you've got a long drive in your plans--say from Dallas to San Diego and back--go ahead and spend the bucks for this trilogy on CD. You'll be glad you did because you won't even remember those long stretches of dreary highway. The reader is excellent. He is British and his accent to the American ear makes the Swedish setting and characters come alive in a way that an American reader could not. He also reads at a perfect pace and his voices for the characters when he reads dialogue are just right: he modulates his voice so that you know exactly who is speaking, but he does not attempt to \\"be\\" each character. I used to listen to lots of books on tape and did not initially like listening on CD because when I wanted to replay a section, I had to go all the way back to the last sector. However, it's been a while since I listened to a book on CD; either the recording techniques have improved, or my new car has a better player, or both, because now I can backup incrementally on the CD as easily (actually, more easily) than I could on tape. Beware, though, that if you do not finish the trilogy on your long trip, you will be taking the CDs to the office and listening on the sly until you finish the whole story!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Numerical corruption and 140 year old english aside, this is a pretty good book, but I prefer my crime mysteries to present the facts so that I might be able to solve it as well. Sherlock Holmes would be much more a hero in my mind if all of the evidence was presented, and yet it was still difficult to solve the issue at hand.<br /><br />An entertaining read, nonetheless.
B000002UA7|3.0|This was my first Kate Bush CD and the introduction of her music into  my life. I was intrigued how a woman that made such a bizarre song such as 'Sat in Your Lap' could then make something as rich as 'Cloudbursting'. And I collected her other albums over time. All of the songs aren't incredible, especially with her earlier ones, but I give her credit for always trying to take chances. That being said, this is not a great 'Best of' collection for her. There's only ten songs on it, a bare minimum for making up an album of pop songs this length. This could have easily have been a 14 song album with defining tracks such as 'Oh England My Lionheart', 'The Big Sky', 'Hammer Horror', and yes, 'Them Heavy People'. She had her huge Hammersmith Odeon concert by this point, perhaps a live version of the latter song. This CD was released in 1986, where is part two? The songs here jump around too much from year to year and that's a bit disconcerting. It also leans heavily on the Hounds of Love CD, released the year before. The Whole Story is a good jumping off point, but Kate Bush's songs only really make sense within the context of the album they were released on. So if you really like particular songs on this CD, go track down the album it was taken from, and enjoy the Whole Experience.
B003D83DPA|5.0|I'm one of those people that believes a concert is more about the sound than it is about the video.  Sure, I like seeing my favorite artists, but I much rather hear them.  There are a whole bunch of concert videos with questionable picture quality that can still benefit greatly from the blu-ray format.  Alchemy live is a perfect example of what I've been saying for a while now.  And finally, a record company gets it.  This is the release that audiophiles have been wanting for years.  Yes, some of these older concerts have low resolution video, a by-product of the times there were recorded.  So while the video doesn't make a case for being put on blu-ray, the audio does.  And that's what delights me as an audiophile.  Blu-ray takes up where DVD-Audio and SACD failed.  Now we can have high resolution multi-channel audio.    And let me just say, this is one of the best sounding concert videos I own, and I own a lot of them.  The mix is just superb for a show that is nearly 30 years old.  There is the perfect level of crowd noise blended in to give you that \\"there\\" feeling without it ever becoming overbearing and overriding the band.  And for the musicians themselves, well everything is perfect clear and concise while still having that warm, analog sound.  Even the bass is properly recorded.  With most concerts you either get thin bass or overblown bass, Alchemy is the rare instance were it's almost perfect.  This concert sounds so good I perfer it over the CD version, though I wish the missing tracks were included on the blu-ray, even if that meant adding a slide show where the video was missing (worked great for Jethro Tull's 1978 MSG dvd).    I only hope that people buy this and show the record companies that there is a market for us crazy audiophiles.  We don't mind that the video isn't much better than VHS or Laser Disc quality, just give us that glorious high resolution audio.  Oh, and let Chuck Ainlay handle the surround mix.  Here's a sound engineer than understands how to employ surround sound correctly!
B003UYUR10|4.0|The movie bombs so they'll make it up out of our pockets in the home market.  Not mine they won't!  And I hope you're smart enough that they won't make it out of yours either.  This kind of disrespect for the home consumer is rampant these days and it won't stop til we stop going for it.  My buck stops here.<br /><br />Okay the above was written when they wanted over forty dollars for it.  Now that they've dropped it to a reasonable if still a wee bit high price...I'm going to go for it simply because I want them to keep making this kind of movie and if they want a little extra profit to cushion the poor theater showing...I'll open the wallet a little wider than usual this once.
B0015DROBO|1.0|This is truly one of the worst books I've ever read! I bought it because it was on the bestseller list and it was recommended by a bookseller. The book is boring from start to finish. There is minimal character development but in depth descriptions of every unappealing meal and cup of coffee they have (endless amounts of coffee). The graphic violent sex scenes have no relevance to the story and are disturbing (I seriously wonder about the author).<br />I've never written a review before but felt compelled to write this one. Hopefully I can prevent others from wasting time reading this book!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This purchase was a gift and it is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The plots interact, some parts are fantasy and some painfully realistic, but it is all about every kind of love, and is thoroughly entertaining.
B000CCZH8G|5.0|As my introduction to the Strokes this album was fantastic! I love their style and will be buying many more albums from them!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|There were many problems with Star Wars when it was rereleased the on DVD and that was the films were deteriorating. They lost color and some footage but they got lucky when they found a good copy of the film. They use digital technology to restore the damaged scenes and colors. Talk about almost loosing a classic we all love. They did a great job at fixing up the films for DVDs. The new problem now is that BluRay players can show the fixes they made. Looks like a new restoration is needed now to fix it farther. I have episodes IV - VI when they were 1st done and I like them that way on VHS. Sad to say but the quality is dying on them that may me buy the DVD version. I have no problem with the new footage and quality I have now to VHS.<br /><br />Now to the technology of the films. Digital technology has been develop tenfolds thanks to Lucas and Spielberg. They created Industrial Light and Magic that everyone uses in Hollywood today for their films. With the development of 3D their are plans of film rereleases in the theaters from Lucas, Spielberg, Cameron and Jackson. To see the next evolution of the Star Wars films it will most likely be in 3D and made for 3D HDTVs. So search out through Amazon and Ebay for the present DVD copies because I don't see anything coming out for a while.
0385006896|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the works of Arthur Conan Doyle. This collection is a fantastic addition to any murder mystery fan's library. The type set is easy to read and the binding and paper quality are very good. You can't beat the price for such a wonderful and historic collection of works. Doyle was a master. I highly recommend this book.  This review is based on the hard cover edition.
B00003CXAA|2.0|I have never cared for the Godfather. I think it really goes nowhere. I can remember going to the Ocean one year (25 years ago) with some guys, and one guy loved this film, and is Italian. I can remember getting up and saying \\"What the hell is this?\\" I think this, and the whole 70's gritty, violent, New York thing is annoying. With some exceptions, see below. And I don't mind gritty. It can be quite good/excellent. But not this.   Brando after On The Waterfront was way overrated. I find that after Streetcar, and on the Waterfront he almost appeared to sulk through his films. But many folks seem to think otherwise. Fine. I don't agree. I like Pacino, but think he is also overrated. And Justice For All, or Serpico are his best films, and really showcase his ability, and are excellent films. Maybe The Panic In Needle Park, but I don't think it's as good as the other two I just mentioned. And The Devils Advocate is always fun. But many of his films are way overated, as is his acting. I would say Duval is underrated. Can we say Network, just to name a few? See where I am going. I want a movie to mean something if it's great. And this just doesn't.  I find this violent soap opera film annoying, and nothing redeeming about any of it's characters. Give me the classics. Film Noir. Something that really does have an edge without the soap opera nonsense. Or the films I mentioned from above, along with some other great films of the 70's that if you look them up on here you will be lucky to find 15 reviews on many of them.
B002ZG9788|2.0|I know a movie shouldn't be rated for anything other than the story itself, but the blu-ray disc forces you to watch close to 10 minutes of advertisements before the movie starts. There is no way to access the menu and bypass the ads!    The movie is not too bad....there were some holes in the plot development, but the CGI effects were good.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I bought my copy at Target, figuring that they'd differentiate between a \\"clean\\" and an \\"explicit\\" version. Unfortunately there only appears to be the censored version. Other than that, brilliant album, I'd say it's one of the top recent releases. Definitely makes good driving music, despite the fact that for some reason my car won't play the CD right.
1597801585|5.0|Most Excellent!  I'll tell you, I'll be looking for more from this guy.  Mostly, I'm amazed at how he creates a complete world, almost in passing, as he tells the stories of several people in enough depth that the reader knows why that character behaves as s/he does.   At the same time, the stories of those characters are woven into a larger, more important story, that has plotting and enough fresh ideas to keep me satisfied, and looking for more.  Thank you, Mr. Bacigalupi.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This one grabbed me right off with the courtroom drama.  Then followed up with the personal stories of the two main characters, who were both believable and made me care about their story.<br /><br />And then we get the heart of the story, a good mystery to be solved!
0756405890|5.0|I laughed out loud, i stompped my feet, i clapped, i smiled, i have never enojoyed a book so much that i literally said \\"oh. my. god. this is the last page.\\" the next day i went running to the book store for part2, only to discover it hadnt come back yet, Im waiting for his second book now like a giddy child in a toy store who is waiting in line, with his parents paying for the item, and i can hardly wait to get into the car and tear the box open in pure joy.
030726999X|5.0|I read all three books quickly, then read them a second time very slowly. I'd take breaks and walk around and ask myself why I loved these books so much. Why are they so compelling? I came up with two main reasons -- and the second is by far the most important: (1) It is a great story, told very well, with a complex plot that brings more and more surprises; and (2) Lisbeth Salander is a great character, one of the greatest characters in modern literature. She stole the book, and she stole the movie. I have a feeling that when Larsson began writing the trilogy, he thought the main character was the journalist, a man much like him. But as soon as he introduced Salander, she took over.<br /><br />In the first book, the part-opening quotes are about abused women; in the third book the part-opening quotes are about women warriors of the world. Salander goes from an abused young girl to a powerful woman warrior, creating her own justice within a system that won't do it for her. She is vulnerable but powerful, withdrawn and intelligent. I think she's going down in history as one of the greatest characters of 21st century literature.
B003X73QA8|4.0|Loved the last 2 albums and I am an equally big fan of this new one. Best songs are The Suburbs, Rococo, Half Light (both of them), and Sprawl II. Great album.
0743270754|3.0|After rereading Gore Vidal's Lincoln, surely one of the great books of all time, I decided it was time I read Goodwin's book to see how it compared.  I wondered how well Vidal's judgement of all the crucial characters would hold up.  My conclusion is that Vidal and Goodwin picture just about every character in a very similar manner.  Goodwin's book provides more detail and is written in a very readable style, but it does not entirely avoid the problem of many such massive tomes - getting excessively bogged down in detail.  While I can't help but praise her effort and knowledge, it takes more than twice as much time to read her book as Vidal's.  I would recommend that anyone wishing to understand Lincoln begin by reading Vidal's book; and then, if they want to delve more deeply, take on Goodwin's book.
0061766089|3.0|In CHANGE BY DESIGN, IDEO CEO Tim Brown fleshes out the concept of Design Thinking he introduced in a June 2008 article in the Harvard Business Review: that design is best when it's not a tweak, made near the end of product development to fine-tune or make pretty, but rather is a substantive, beginning-to-end way of thinking; a 360-degree method of business collaboration.    I'd heard terrific things about IDEO and Brown but my first direct experience was through this book -- where I twice didn't make it to page 50 and only now persevered to finish. It's not a difficult read, it's dull. There are some interesting concepts (particularly about prototyping and paying attention to customers at the extremes) and case studies (showcasing IDEO projects). But it's rarely inspiring or entertaining and mostly accumulates rather than builds. In stark contrast, I've just finally watched clips of Brown's presentations (widely available on the web) and feel positively carbonated! My recommendation: first get familiar with Tim Brown, then let his infectious enthusiasm carry over to your reading of this book.    P.S. In Brown's spirit of maintaining creativity and play over a lifetime, I highly recommend Gordon MacKenzie's weird and wonderful [[ASIN:0670879835 Orbiting the Giant Hairball]].

B002VECMAE|4.0|This must be one of the silliest movies I've seen in quite a while. \\"Silly\\" usually means I did not like it. But this one is different. Although silly, I still liked it. I kept watching, just to see what silly stuff would come up next. I guess this is not a movie for everyone. After watching, it crossed my mind, that perhaps if you are a fan of History Channel, you may like this movie. Simply because the subject might be of interest. I found the cast also very good. I think they would have a hard time pulling this kind of movie of with any other cast.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie is when Bop wakes up in a car in the middle of the dessert, doesn't see his buddy Lynn,.... panics and runs of yelling for Lynn in the dessert. I won't spoil it here for those who haven't seen it, but imagine being in such a situation,.... definitely not a place I would like to be!<br /><br />I also liked the special feature on the DVD where (apparently) real ex-psychic military people talk about some of the things they were trying. Truly bizarre,... but interesting.<br /><br />In any case, be aware this is probably not for everyone. If you like the cast, and the topic/theme is of interest to you, you may like this movie. Otherwise... well, you may not.
B003L7861E|5.0|Like other reviewers, I absolutely adore this book.  It captivated me immediately and kept it's hold to the very end, and I still wanted more.  My husband and his family are Indian, and I felt like this book gave me a secret insight into their family history by proxy, and inspired me to dive into their culinary history head on.  It inspired me to really open a relationship with my mother in law and get down to the nitty gritty of learning their recipes to keep that tradition alive for our daughter.  After one day of reading, my husband came home to biryani and ras malai. It's impossible not to be hungry, both spiritually and physically, while reading this book.    I laughed, cried, took breaks to cook, and kept reading.  This book taught me that it is indeed possible to both devour and savor something you love, and will be on my regular list for years to come.  For foodies, this is the penultimate read, and a triumph for a first novel.
B002ZG980U|5.0|An industrial spy (Leonardo DiCaprio) who can enter dreams to steal ideas leads a team (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Dileep Rao) into the mind of a young billionaire (Cillian Murphy) to introduce one instead.  This involves a mind-bending scheme that involves dreams within dreams and requires the participants to risk spending a subjective eternity in the limbo of the subconscious.    I'm looking forward to Christopher Nolan's next Batman movie, but after this film, I kind of wish he wasn't wedded to that franchise and was instead free to create his next movie out of whole cloth.  He is one of the most impressive visionaries working in film today.  Here, he takes the familiar trope of the hardened professional willing to risk everything on one last job that will allow him to begin his life anew, and uses it as the foundation for an innovative story that doesn't spoon-feed the audience.  Some have criticized it for being confusing, and it is certainly complex, but attentive viewers should have little trouble following the action.  It is surprisingly effective on the emotional level as well for a big budget Hollywood spectacle.
B002I9Z89Y|3.0|Not as disappointed as when I got Season One, but still disappointed in this box set.  After Season One, I had hoped an annoying technical glitch would have been fixed, but alas, no.  As in Season One, there is an annoying glitch where suddenly the scene stops and it skips backwards to start it over.  In Season Two it skips backwards only about a minute in time, whereas in the Season One discs it skips back 10 minutes or so.    I also wish each disc had an option to choose an episode and go straight to it.  Instead you are required to view them in chronological order.  So if you want to view the third episode on the disc, you have to fast forward through the first two.   When I get around to purchasing Season Three, I will go back to the standard DVD and hopefully avoid the Blu-Ray glitches.

142313494X|4.0|What if the gods of Olympus were alive in the 21st Century? What if they still fell in love with mortals and had children who might become great heroes -- like Theseus, Jason and Hercules?<br />What if you were one of those children?<br />Such is the discovery that launches twelve-year-old Percy Jackson on the most dangerous quest of his life. With the help of a satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass destruction - Zeus' master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.<br /><br />Pecry has never fit in at school or in life in general he lives with his loving mom and not so loving step dad. After being attacked at school by something not human he finds out the hard way that he himself is not quite human either. No he is a demi god, half human half god and the son of not just any god but the god of the sea, Poseidon. But that fact alone has helped create a upcoming war with the gods. Zeus's master bolt is missing and he is blaming Poseidon and the only one who can prevent war is 12 year old Percy Jackson .<br />With his new friends he has made at a camp for demi gods, Percy sets forth on a impossible mission that he feels he is doomed to fail. He just wants to get his mom back that was killed by a monster wail trying to get him to the camp. But if he doesn't find Zeus's bolt missing his mom will be the least of his problems.

B000002KBD|5.0|Already basking in the bright musical light of both his [[ASIN:B000002KAT Astral Weeks]] and [[ASIN:B000002KHF Moondance]] the now happily married Van Morrison was looking to reconcile his spiritual quests with the music of the Earth. And the music of the Earth was not necessarily anything raw and gutteral but bright,elegantly produced soul. Always a hugely poetic figure the romanticism in Morrison's music is working overtime on every song on this album. Musically it's completely based in soul. Sometimes it's soul music itself and other times it's a type of music that speaks to the soul but isn't within the structure of the sound itself. Songs such as \\"Crazy Face\\",\\"Virgo Clowns\\" and \\"Gypsy Queen\\" are more lightly jazzy folk-pop which is part of Van's sound anyway but don't exactly sound like the rolled off the Stax/Volt review. Now for a more direct channeling of that sort of musical sound of course there's \\"Domino\\". Now this isn't a precise imitation of American Southern soul. Nothing about Morrison's musical vision would ever allow something so imitative. It has this light jazzy drumming flavor and even some a very genuine tribute to the mid/late 60's Motown rhythm style. One of the most amazing songs here is \\"I've Been Working\\". Now this is a churning,sophisticated and raw James Brown styled rhythm guitar led slice of funk wherein Van belts his heart out vocally on a lyric that actually is very close to a Luther Vandross song of the same title released a decade later. The song also has a very strong Stax styled gospel soul flavor to it too that's very much in keeping with his vision. Other songs such as \\"Call Me Up In Dreamland\\",\\"Gypsy Queen\\" and especially the driving \\"Blue Money\\" all maintain a strong sense of funk as well but with a more obvious British rock style rhythm & blues style-although put through the Van Morrison music blender that somehow adds his own stamp to everything he does. The final two songs \\"If I Ever Needed Someone\\" and \\"Street Choir\\" really deliver heavily on the churchy Otis Redding style Southern soul ballad. Now in many great moments after this Van Morrison would continue variating on this basic sound again and again but he seldom shined with it as brightly and as magically as he did on this particular album.meone\\" and \\"Street Choir\\" really deliver heavily on the churchy Otis Redding style Southern soul ballad.

B001CIPU3G|5.0|To say that I am truly amazed by this album would be an understatement.  Honestly, I was not expecting much after listening to The Crusade.  The Crusade was not a bad album, but lacked the energy that I look for when I listen to heavy metal.  Shogun completely blew me away, combining the best from Ascendancy and The Crusade.  It sounds good from start to finish.  It is melodic, yet will pound the hell out of you at the same time.  It is clear that Trivium is a very experienced group and that lots of work was put into this album.  I listen to it over and over again and love it every time.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|For those of you who are not aware, Serenity is a film that serves as the conclusion to Joss Whedon's sci-fi television series, Firefly. Firefly was a phenomenal show that ended well before its time. Patrons of show, like myself, were left wanting more after watching the 14th and final episode. Serenity was the answer to those prayers. Whedon tied off many of the loose ends with the film that were left open after the conclusion of Firefly. However, Serenity is also a great stand-alone movie as well. Whedon had enough foresight to add plenty exposition for viewers who were not familiar with the television series, giving them just as much of a chance to enjoy the film. The CGI was also stepped up from the series, making the action sequences that much more entertaining. Serenity is an amazing film that I would recommend to anyone looking for an excellent way to spend a couple hours. My one and only gripe however is plot related so *SPOILER ALERT*, the captain STILL doesn't get together with Anara. Seriously Whedon, Simon and Kaylee finally but not Mal and Anara?!?! The biggest loose end remains untied...FOREVER.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|It's so nice to see Eminem back on top of his game.  At first it was hard not to compare this album with his older stuff like the Marshall Mathers LP, but nobody should rap the same way forever.  Now that's he's sober, he can once again use his wide range of talent, lyrical genius and prodigal creativity to their fullest.  Every song on this album is spirited and comes from his heart.  No song is merely aimed at topping the charts, yet the energy is all there and amazing.  In Relapse, I got the sense that he was trying to bring back Slim Shady, but in Recovery every song comes from deep within.<br /><br />Eminem has matured so much since The Slim Shady LP, but has not lost any of his talent.  I give him lots of credit for being honest about considering writing a song bashing Lil' Wayne, and then deciding not to.  It was heartwarming to hear him feature Lil' Wayne in \\"No Love,\\" after admitting in track 2 that he was jealous of him.  \\"You're Never Over\\" is one of the most uplifting songs ever made since his 8 Mile songs back in 2002.  He finally has a song good enough to dedicate to his best friend Proof, after falling short in Relapse.  \\"Seduction\\" is very funny and showcases Eminem's lightheartedness that has finally surfaced, and his shameless confidence that is reborn.  I first picked up The Marshall Mathers LP as a middle school student and have been a fan ever since.  Ten years later, I still firmly believe that Eminem is the best rapper to ever live, and his latest album Recovery is nothing but top notch.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing. Anyone I have ever talked to, who has also seen it, agrees that the show ended well before its time. Never before has there been such a perfect blend of the Wild West and science fiction. Moreover Joss Whedon does a phenomenal job of developing the storyline and the main characters to the point that the viewers become emotionally attached to their pains, joys, successes and failures. The biggest drawback to the series is that there are only 14 episodes and the viewer is definitely left wanting more.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|Kinsella delivers a laugh-out-loud, witty novel. I think a lot of women will be able to see themselves in Rebecca's shoes and relate to her. A highly entertaining novel with a fresh voice and talented writing. I would definitely recommend this for a beach read. Only one word of warning...you won't be able to put it down!
0156012197|5.0|Apparently written for children, The Little Prince is packed with wisdom about love and life.  I first came across it in college French class and now I make sure all my family and good friends have a copy.
B001AZI1W8|5.0|My musical taste tends more in the direction of jazz-rock fusion, though I like all sorts of music, including some pop music.  Among pop artists, I would say that Rihanna has emerged as one of my favorites.  Whereas some pop artists have a rather formulaic and gimmicky approach which tells you they're not going to be around for long, Rihanna has genuine musicality.  Her songs are well crafted and fairly diverse, covering the spectrum from rock to carribean party vibes to heartfelt ballads, and her singing is surprisingly good, with phrasing which often reminds me of guitar playing (though, as a guitarist myself, perhaps I'm predisposed to hear that).<br /><br />This concert DVD brings out all of these qualities.  Again, the songs and Rihanna's singing are generally excellent.  On top of that, her band sounds great too, and the overall sound quality of the DVD is excellent.  As far as the non-musical aspects of the show, they aren't quite as stellar as the music, but still acceptable.  For example, her four dancers have a relatively minor role, and Rihanna herself doesn't do much serious dancing.  Likewise, the wardrobes and stage lighting get the job done, but they're not as theatrically powerful as some other concerts I've seen.<br /><br />But music comes first so, all things considered, I think this is an excellent concert performance, and I especially recommend it to fans of Rihanna.
B003U9TDII|5.0|The theme is dark and sparks with the constant searching, pursuing and traversing relentless obstacles. There are diverse emotions to the different tracks - which coincides with the given scenes of the movie. I like how they have included band instruments, orchestra instruments and even guitars in the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has composed a beatifully mastered work of art.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|This CD has been in my car stereo and iPod since it was released. I can't stop listening to it. The entire CD is great and there isn't a single track that you want to skip over. Kylie is at the top of her game and the tracks are pop heaven. Highly recommended!
0764207407|5.0|This Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen was a blast to read.  I have to admit, I didn't know what I was getting myself into.  At first, I thought all the little sidebars were a little annoying, but as I got further and further into the book, I found myself actually looking forward to them.<br /><br />This book is a classic written in the beautiful prose of the 18th Century writer, Miss Jane Austen.  I can't remember the last time I had read one of her books, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book.  It even inspired me to rent the 1995 movie with Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant in it.  I love the contrasts between the two sisters, the overly dramatic, romance-seeking Marianne, and the calm, steady, level-headed, Elinor.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing more books like this from Bethany House.  This is a great way to get re-acquainted with the classics.<br /><br />This book was provided to me free of charge as part of Bethany House Book Reviewers.
B002Z5VFAM|5.0|I have a 47\\" tv.  It's mounted on the wall and my family of 5 watched it.  Crazy!!!!  Before the end of the movie I was getting sick to my stomach because of the 3D effect.   The glasses are very sturdy and are like normal sun glasses.  Great for little ones.  They are hard to break.  Great for anyone looking for a cool gift idea.
B00012BSHG|1.0|I bought this pool because I read in the reviews and the product discription that it has a drainplug, the first one that I ordered did'nt have a drainplug. Amazon told me to order it again, but the second one didn't have a drainplug too. Now I will send this one back...again. And  I really wan't to know wich pool all the people ordered who wrote in the review that the pool has a drainplug!!!!!!

B0021L8UPS|5.0|I was totally not expecting Orphan to be *this* awesome.    The little girl who plays the orphan from Russia that an American family adopts is REALLY evil.  Her character is just fantastic.  She is believable in all aspects of the storyline.      All the violent and twisted things the girl does to her new brothers and sisters (along with their parents) will have you feeling a ton of suspense.  You will be totally shocked that such a young girl is saying and acting out all those horrible things she does.    She seriously deserves a bunch of awards for her role in Orphan.  I hope she received some.    I absolutely love how the storyline develops too.  The parents initially believe they are adopting a sweet and innocent little girl because of how polite she acts towards them.  They soon discover that the girl has a ton of mental problems and is totally sick in the head.    People like to compare this film to the Good Son, but let me tell ya- *nothing* in the Good Son is as evil as this girl, haha.   She goes straight to stabbing people, shooting people, murdering, pretending she's older than she really is in an attempt to hit on people, hurting herself in an attempt to make her new parents feel sorry for her, hurting other kids on the playground, burning people alive, and even threatening her family that if they reveal her dirty little secrets she will find a way to kill them, etc.      Every line she delivers is really mature and perfectly executed.  It really surprises me that someone this young can put on such a performance.    This next paragraph I'm about to write is apparently a crucial storyline element for some people (and therefore a spoiler) so if you don't want to know about something minor that happens later on, skip this next paragraph and read the last one-    I like how later on we find out that she's actually 33 years old and only pretending to be a child.  I actually had to look that up online to see if Isabelle Fuhrman really IS 33 years old.   Nah, that's just part of the storyline.  She was born in 1997.  I kind of assumed that, but hey, you never know.    Overall, the amount of suspense this movie features is insanely constant, and the storyline is disturbingly violent.  I strongly recommend Orphan to everyone who loves the Good Son, the Hand that Rocks the Cradle, etc.  It's even better than those movies in my opinion.
159562015X|5.0|I found the book very insightful with the online materials.  It's a great product!
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Picked this up after reading so many great reviews here and on IMDB. I must say, that it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. The script is GREAT. Wonderful dialogue, acting, sets, costumes, plot, EVERYTHING about this movie is top notch. The plot has been explained in plenty of detail in other reviews, but I will say, that Sunset Blvd is a masterpiece. William Holden gave one of the best performances I've ever seen, but even his great performance was out shined by the legendary Gloria Swanson in the role of her lifetime. Adding Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Gloria's butler was casting genius.<br />  The movie is also so good, because it needs repeated viewings to get all the great dialogue, and symbolism that is on display. A wonderful way to spend a night, is to watch 'Sunset Blvd' The DVD is great, Paramount did a great job remastering this classic, and adding all sorts of great special features today's buyer expect.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a tough workout but it's over so quick-that's the joy of it!  In starting off with the program, I grunted and struggled to get through it but then it's over and doesn't seem so bad.  I plan to use it again after my son is born as part of my work out to get back in shape post baby.  I did not use the program as planned, but rather used it a couple times a week to suppliment my treadmill/weight routiens or for those days when I needed a good quick work out-I certainly felt it the next day too!!
B00328G4XY|5.0|I had this cd. But I wanted to buy because the video. But for me isn't worth. If was the new pictures it's ok. The video shows the sound enginner talks about the same musics not all.  As to the cd is not necessary comment JImi Hendrix is a god of guitar.
B0007X6ST2|5.0|After developing thru the Police in a most remarkable way Stin went solo at tht time and I was quite curious which path he would go. Being a jazzrock, miles davis fan myself I was pleasantly surprised that stin came up with such an excellent line up<br />beautifully merged with his song writing. I can also recommend the corresponding DVD as to how the music came to be and was rehearsed somewhere in an old French castle.<br />Unfortunatley enough Sting has never met this quality ever since despite the enormous commercial success he gained with other projects. This band is so full of energy and tickles the right mixture between being melodic and jazzy feel.<br />I would also highly recommend the 2005 line up with two guitars only, no keyboards , which brings the old police intensity back again. I truly hope that Sting will be able to perform again with the similar line up as bring on the night .<br />A job well done
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This powerful, sobering, yet ultimately hopeful documentary sheds some clear light on the murky, cruel and sordid state of our modern food industry, and ends with these simple words; \\"You can vote to change this system - Three times a day.\\"<br /><br />The revolution must begin in America's heartland - but it must also include us all.<br /><br />Who suffers from this current system? The farmers (world-wide), the workers, and the consumers.<br /><br />Who benefits? The businesses and the politicians who work for them.

0446563048|5.0|In this volume, Tony Hsieh (pronounced \\"SHAY\\") shares all of the business lessons he learned from success and (especially) from failure prior to and then during his association with Zappos.com, first as an adviser and investor in 1999 and then as CEO, a position he continues to occupy after the acquisition of Zappos by Amazon in 2009.  He has organized the material in this book as follows: \\"The first section is titled `Profits' and consists mostly of stories of me growing up and eventually finding my way to Zappos...The second section, `Profits and Passion,' is more business-oriented, covering many of the important philosophies that we believe in and live by at Zappos...The third section is titled `Profits, Passion, and Purpose.' It outlines our vision at Zappos for taking things to the next level, and will hopefully challenge you to do the same.\\" As Hsieh explains, the name Zappos is derived from the Spanish word \\"zapatos\\" meaning shoes. The company's gross sales exceeded $1-billion in 2009.<br /><br />As I began to read the book, I was especially interested in sharing Hsieh's thoughts about subjects such as these:<br /><br />Why he sold a company he co-founded, LinkExchange, to Microsoft<br />Why he became involved with Zappos initially<br />Why he agreed to become CEO<br />What the drivers of Zappos' extraordinary growth have been<br />How Zappos has differentiated itself from its competition<br />Why Zappos offers $2,000 to some of its new hires to quit<br />How and why everyone in the company is customer-centric<br />Those who have had the greatest influence on his development as a leader and manager<br />Why he agreed to have Zappos acquired by Amazon<br />How both he and Zappos have been able to retain an entrepreneurial spirit<br /><br />Near downtown Dallas, we have a Farmers Market at which some of the merchants offer sample slices of fresh fruit. In that same spirit, I now offer three brief excerpts that suggest the thrust and flavor of Hsieh's insights.<br /><br />\\"One day, I woke up after hitting the snooze button on my alarm clock six times. I was about to hit it a seventh time when I realized something. The last time I had snoozed so many times was when I was dreading going to work at Oracle. It was happening again, except this time, I was dreading going to work at LinkExchange.\\" He was co-founder of a company whose culture, over time, had changed from an \\"all-for-one, one-for-all\\" team environment to one that was now \\"all about politics, positioning, and rumors.\\" (Page 48) Hsieh realized then that the most successful organizations are those whose people love what they do and do what they love.<br /><br />After Zappos was literally \\"saved\\" by a line of credit provided by Well Fargo Bank, Hsieh sent an email to Zappos' employees, vendors, and friends. After citing the increased sales (from \\"almost nothing\\" in 1999 to $32 million in $32) and noting that the company is \\"on track\\" to reach $60-65 million in 2003, he warns against carelessness and overconfidence. Zappos will continue to be customer-centric, not because it has to do it to achieve shirt-term results but because \\"we believe that in the long run, little things that keep the customer in mind will end up paying huge dividends\\" to everyone. \\"There will be a lot of changes ahead as we grow, but one thing will always be constant: our focus on constantly improving the customer experience.\\" On this very special day. Hsieh reaffirms the company's commitment: \\"Deliver WOW Through Service.\\"<br /><br />Whenever asked what he would have done differently if doing Zappos all over again, Hsieh responded, \\"I do wish that we could have done things faster.\\" He makes that point again on another special day when he sums up everything in one sentence: \\"Getting married to Amazon will allow us to fulfill our vision of delivering happiness to the world much faster... To me, that one moment [of celebration and appreciation] represented success far beyond what I could have possibly imagined would be achievable ten years ago...[The moment signified that] half intentionally and half by luck, we had found our path to profits, passion, and purpose. We had found our path to delivering happiness.\\"<br /><br />True to character, Hsieh devotes the final chapter of his book to his reader to whom he speaks directly and frankly, asking tough questions and making practical suggestions because he is determined to help his readers - as he continues to help Zappos colleagues - to find their own path to profits, passion, and purpose...a path on which they can also \\"deliver happiness.\\"ntentionally and half by luck, we had found our path to profits, passion, and purpose. We had found our path to delivering happiness.\\"     True to character, Hsieh devotes the final chapter of his book to his reader to whom he speaks directly and frankly, asking tough questions and making practical suggestions because he is determined to help his readers - as he continues to help Zappos colleagues - to find their own path to profits, passion, and purpose...a path on which they can also \\"deliver happiness.\\"

B0036TGSR6|3.0|The film had a good tension level, and opened well and held my interest, but at a certain point I found it to be rather bleak, somewhat flat, with a poor ending.  I thought Polanski could have done much, much better.
B002ZG991S|4.0|I really liked the dancing but that's about all there is to this. Other than the dancing, there is a predictable rather lame storyline to tie the dancing together. Ultimately though, because of the great dancing, I enjoyed it. I saw it in 3D but didn't find that it added all that much to my experience. I would have liked it just as much had I seen in in 2D.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|I enjoyed hearing James and Carol together with their stories in between songs.  I am so used to the original I found myself longing for the original interpretation of the songs rather than the live improvisation.  Maybe this is just me.

8182522218|5.0|Of course, I read the first published, \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\" in high school. It made me feel like I wasn't all alone with my feelings. I first bought the Complete and Unabridged book for my husband's niece when she turned fourteen. She loved it and still owns it. I also read the book at that time and it filled in gaps that I didn't realize were missing until they were added back. I liked how she spoke of her sexual feelings because in a very real sense, sex is one of the most important components of continuing the human species. That there are those who feel squeamish about speaking about it is a testament to beliefs about keeping some things \\"private\\" when speaking about them will rid teenagers of myths they may believe. Anyway, I bought this copy for my friend's daughter who will be turning fifteen in September and I am hoping she will enjoy it as much as my husband's niece and I did. And all the millions of girls who have.
B000002I99|5.0|This classic album presents Gothic rock 'n' roll at its best.  Cooper's lyrics, such as \\"Some folks die without a warning\\" in \\"Some Folks\\" may inspire one to contemplate one's own mortality, which is in stark contrast to Ezrin's lively melody - the incongruity is splendidly eerie.  Conversely, the strong harmony between Cooper's lyrics and Ezrin's haunting melody of \\"Stephen\\" is magnificently chilling.  The CD is well worth the extra money because it is the way it is supposed to be, complete with Vincent Price's narrative at the beginning of \\"The Black Widow,\\" which is essential to the song. \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" is truly a frightfully superb classic!
B000JVSUS4|1.0|I bought this because I saw the aircraft used in the movie being wrapped up to be sent to Hawaii. The only thing true in this movie is that the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor. While the graphics were fair, I still can't understand how the director can think the viewer is that stupid as to think a Japanese pilot would fly between hangers during the Pearl attack AND they would be shot at by airplanes and ships shooting down, into the Americans that were on the other side of the airplane.  Plus, the \\"heros\\" of the story end up crash-landing together after the Doolittle raid. Yes this is a chick-flick for those who have no idea of history or reality.
0375507256|2.0|This is one of those novels people talk and write about reverently, so you go into the experience of reading it with either high expectations or a squinted eye, doubting that it can possibly live up to the lavish praise. This one doesn't. The structure of the book is clever-- break it up into multiple stories that slightly overlap each other but not really. Mix in a bunch of styles and genres (thriller, dystopian-end of the world, epistolary, Science Fiction...) and then fan them out like a deck of cards so the first story ends with the last chapter, the 2nd story with the 2nd to last, etc. The problem however is twofold-- none of the characters are particularly interesting or sympathetic, and some are even cliche. So after a while you don't really care what happens to any of them-- whether their fate is good or bad. The second problem is you've seen the stories before in slightly altered versions. For example, the Science Fiction story seems like a clone of BLADERUNNER and a William Gibson short story. A great novel doesn't mimic-- it shows you the world through new eyes. When it's successful, CLOUD ATLAS is very good mimicry: the author knows his genres and styles. And as mentioned, the structure of the novel is sui generis. But clever structure and good mimicry is not enough to buoy up a 500 page story or to merit calling the writer a \\"genius\\" which I've seen in a number of reviews of the book.
0307577589|5.0|Really enjoyed it although it does get a bit gruesome at times.  I like a good thriller and mystery so I really enjoyed this.  I have purchased the next two books of the trilogy.
B003460IWC|4.0|The 1st move it the start of it all, it´s the one I would concider to be the most like a scary movie. You actually get the sence that something supernatural is out to get the people in it. All in all a good movie.    The 2nd movie aren´t as scary, as a matter of fact I fund it to be more or less entertaining with the way people died. Still a nice movie.     The 3rd movie was ok, but not even close to be as good as the first or as entertaning as the second.

B001PPLIFU|3.0|I have always waited for the next Bond film. I have them all in DVD. But I am hestitant for the next one (if the series doesn't sink with MGM) if it has the same director. I would have given this 5 stars but for the cinematogaphy. This is a great story, but the use of >.5 sec per action shots had me asking myself, \\"What just happened?\\". You could actually miss things if you blink at the wrong time. I got to the point that I actually looked away during the action scenes because of the rapidity between shots. I couldn't keep up with them. In dvd, I am able to fast forward through those scenes.  This was a good story, and great to end the last movie and start this one like they did. Just need to slow it down.
0765322889|5.0|Before I grab a long epic read, I like to understand what I'm getting into. This 10 book epic is 3.5M words long! This first book has lovers and others that have weighed in with opinions. For me, Erickson hits it out of the park in every volume though you won't know how well until book 10.<br /><br />Waiting on book 10:<br /><br />The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts in Erickson's approach. As I read the book by book review of this epic by Amazon readers, they are not much help. None of the individual installments stand on their own but are a distinct reading pleasure within the total.<br /><br />After reading nearly 10,000 pages of Malazan-world, you should understand that you are making a long term commitment of 100's of reading hours.  The good news - It's worth it ... stick it out. The bad news ... book 10 promises to close the epic.<br /><br />I'm choosy in where I invest reading time in massive fantasy. I've been gyped. JRR Tolkien finished the first modern fantasy epic. How Erikson wraps up the 10,000 page epic should be a wonder.<br /><br />Given the wonder, I cannot recommend this entertainment highly enough to you. After 10k pages, the mystery for me is whether it's 80% fantasy and 20% ScFi or vice versa or neither. The conclusion should answer that question. This work is interchangeably intensely dark and ineffably noble. The reader must glean the differences that are buried in the many levels of complexity as the story unfolds. Erickson's command of the language is the best I've ever seen and is subtly significant to the story. Philosophical threads are profoundly explored across the volumes. The reader is kept unsettled in distinguishing the nature of selflessly good and monstrous evil. Erikson's writing style pushes the readers own command of language to reveal the masterpiece that the Malazan books represent.<br /><br />My only issue, and it's not trivial, is that the 10 book series really, really needs a reference companion. There are hundreds of characters, dozens of races, 300,000 years of active story,  a global map never revealed, and maps that might be the worst I've ever seen for following the volume being read. I gave up on trying to discern location, distance and destination language. Characters appear and disappear from the narrative but return two or three volumes later. This not normally an issue except that Erickson's characters are so vastly different and unique that a quick refresher is needed for reference.<br /><br />BOOK 10 update:<br /><br />Erickson closes the curtain on this magnificently entertaining  mega-epic after 3.5M words. Individually, each of the 10 volumes is 5-star, none stand better than another in their turn and they have kept this reader eager and wanting.  In total, the now complete 10 volume read is rather off the scale for a numerical rating in my humble opinion. I can't imagine that a fantasy reader can claim knowing the genre without completing the Tale of the Malazan. It's for that reason that relating the story in a review does an injustice for the masterpiece that I think will be the legacy in years to come. The Tale of the Malazan is simply too massive, too complex, too nuanced to be adequately related.<br /><br />Erikson's style has remained on the edge of a kind of fantastical insanity with each volume. His style is disturbing and gritty at more levels of emotion, philosophy and logic then a reader might absorb. His mastery of characters is stunning in their entanglement in the tale. His mastery of the mind numbingly horrific opening line is rather unparalleled. The reader must strain to climb the wall of image intensity that Erikson paints in words, themes, characters and scale. Erikson's work is philosophical, psychological and compelling in the fantasy that he has so intricately woven.  Depravity, emotion and nature are unleashed in an assault on the reader's senses.<br /><br />Through book 9, an ending was a great mystery and seemingly impossible to imagine. Book 10 would make or break all that Erikson had produced before. Book 10 quite simply delivers on all levels. The tapestry woven in the 10 volume story is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Bravo Steven Erikson!o imagine. Book 10 would make or break all that Erikson had produced before. Book 10 quite simply delivers on all levels. The tapestry woven in the 10 volume story is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Bravo Steven Erikson!
B0033TJATW|5.0|This movie goes to show you how ahead of his time Michael was. The movie/video combo is still fresh,crisp, funny, poignant,and entertaining after all these years. Speed demon, Leave me alone, Smooth Criminal,etc etc. They are all good. (And Michael is so cute too.)If you remember this from the 80's- get it you'll love seeing it again. If you have never seen it- get it- you'll love it!
B003A4IFDW|5.0|Excellent.  Bettye LaVette is phenomenal.  We are blessed to be witnesses of this tremendously talented artist.
0793518326|5.0|This book is everything I expected it to be. All the instrument parts for all the songs - what more could I ask for? Personally I play the piano, sometimes in a band, so it's very refreshing finding orginal piano parts to the songs rather than having to try and work them out from below-average arrangements made just for the piano. At the moment the band is putting together \\"Get Back\\" and having the music for the piano solo is fantastic because it would be so hard to work out otherwise. Only thing is I needed to do was of course write out the music for just my part, which I do with some free software I downloaded. And the book is way too thick to put on a music stand of any description (which is to be expected when it has over 200 songs fully transcibed!).
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I am not going to say that mono is the holy grail, that you must get this, that mono is best. I just think if you like The Beatles and have the money (and it is expensive), you should consider getting both the mono and stereo versions of every album they did. Both are great, and to be honest would you want A Day In The Life, I Am The Walrus or Strawberry Fields Forever in just mono? No. Stereo is excellent and fine, but has an \\"over there\\" quality, some things on left, some on the right, you have breathing room, you can analyze the musical elements. But in mono every sound is right in your face and in both ears the entire song, the bass is louder and usually more satisfying, you ride the wave of sound as various elements go higher and lower in the mix, unable to quite make sense of what all the sounds are, just taking pleasure at what The Beatles created. It packs a wallop and does something different in your head. I liken the mono box to the greatest AM radio you could ever imagine. Also there are the little differences in the mixes that also make mono distinctive and new. So by having both stereo and mono versions, you get two different experiences of all their great songs. You may not want to spend the money on the Mono Box, but if you like the music you should find some way to give these a listen.
0446569895|5.0|Simply put - one of the best books I have ever read. Extremely truthful, and very well written. I never followed Ozzy or Black Sabbath. I was raised in the 80's on Rick Springfield, REO Speedwagon, etc. I was not ever into heavy metal. I picked this book up in the library and I remember how much my brother loved him. I could not put this book down once I started it. My husband, who never reads, read most of it as well. Ozzy is honest about his life, and I appreciate any human who admits that he has regrets. It is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it even if you only have a passing notion (like I did) of the person you thought Ozzy was.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I bought this processor along with an Asus Crosshair IV motherboard and they are a great combo. Great speed and performance from the processor and no temperature problems. The 965 Black Edition is a great buy for the cost.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I love James Taylor and Carole King and have since they first started out on the music scene. I really have enjoyed the Live at the Troubadour and would recommend it to anyone who likes to listen to James Taylor or Carole King. They have great chemistry. They are both great songwriters and singers. I love the music they make together.
B003OJBWGK|4.0|If you liked the Vivian Girls' first LP, this is a no-brainer. It's very Californian, as probably every review that's been written on it has mentioned, in the way that Pavement's Crooked Rain Crooked Rain is, but it's got a taste of the Ramones in there also -- a few songs are in the mold of \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" and that kind of stuff. It's a good album for put on when you're out on your skateboard and the night is just humming, like the Pavement song says. I wish the Vivian Girls' second album had been this good, but then again, life is a veil of tears.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|BEFORE YOU BUY:  This boxed set features the film in two flavors: Blu-Ray and DVD. It's presented in a glorious 16:9 (1.78) aspect ratio for Full Screen playback on your HDTV! This was clearly cropped and derived from the original IMAX 4K Master, but with a little more screen space preserved and shown for those of us who saw it in Dolby/Digital 3D with the 35mm projection at a 2.39:1 aspect ratio. The transfer is the highest quality I've seen so far, with no banding, artifacts, or grain visible. On a low note there are no special features or behind-the-scenes/making of videos on this release- as expected and that's okay. However some of those- including a 22 minute making of feature have long been released on the internet for free, presented up to 1080p. Search \\"Creating the World of Pandora\\" for example. While the 3D experience was definitely innovative and mature, it's not presented here. After viewing this in 2D it's safe to say that it'll hardly be missed.    THE MOVIE:  The story presented of \\"Avatar\\" is one we've heard before in many flavors and forms- especially in western society. Even if you didn't see the trailer it's not hard at all to feel it's familiarity & predict what's to come not too far in. But why should predictability be labeled a bad thing? Let's face it: the only part that surprised us with Cameron's previous feature- easily among the most predictable movies of all time, \\"Titanic\\" -was when Jack died. Even if you didn't read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books, you know that Sauron and the One Ring will eventually be destroyed, and Middle Earth would return to peace. \\"Star Wars\\" wasn't the first \\"farm boy becomes a knight to save a princess\\" tale either. It's about how a story is told, it's pacing and it's content. While \\"Avatar\\" is heavily technical above all the other usual areas of film making, there's a great story here that profoundly resonated with the worldwide audience unlike anything since \\"Titanic,\\" out performing the previous $1.8 billionrecord with a staggering $2.7 billion box office take. To put that into perspective, \\"The Return of the King\\" has gotten the closest to eclipsing \\"Titanic\\" since then with $1.1 billion but still short $700 million. These numbers aren't adjusted for inflation but still reflect the previous decade's releases quite well. It was Cameron and his team who took this risk and we should be inspired by his astonishing, if hardly surprising success.     For those who say that it wasn't for the story in Avatar which helped it grab all that money then \\"Transformers 2\\" would of grossed $2 billion on visuals alone while \\"How to Tame Your Dragon\\" would of reached similar heights because of it's great 3D. Unfortunately for the naysayers, \\"Avatar\\" is a universal story that people like, a form of the Hero's Journey- all while engineered and aimed at the large audience. On a side note the story is also heavily liberal, with sometimes in-your-face political references- which isn't exactly a bad thing, but some may view it as one-sided or possibly annoying by the way it's presented. However, in the context of what Cameron is calling for- a respect for nature, the environment, and people who are not like us, it works brilliantly well in the end.     The acting ranges from average to exceptional, with Zoe Saldana as \\"Neytiri\\" clearly the star of the show and giving us a great physical & emotional performance. The dialogue is possibly the weakest part of the film, but why be so nit picky with a movie like this? It's possible to look at it all as almost completely hokey, yet if you allow it \\"Avatar\\" will take your breath away. On a good day I'd rate it an 8/10, but it continues to remain my personal favorite at this time.    THE TECHNICAL SIDE:  Plot, dialogue, and perhaps a lack of overall depth to shorten the movie aside, on a technical level alone- this film is nearly a masterpiece if there ever was. Almost nothing can prepare you for the near flawless execution of Visual Effects, Film Editing, Cinematography, Music/Score, and even Sound Mixing/Editing minus the borrowed \\"Jurassic Park\\" sound effects. The visuals are completely out of this world with nearly 60% of the movie being entirely CGI, with entire forests, sunlight and all presented in near photo-realistic quality. The Film Editing and pacing is top notch as well- with the opening sequence & end battle being among the highlights, choreographed with Cameron's endless lust for perfection. For the story we're being sold here not one moment goes by where it feels too lengthy or overdone. The camera work is solid too, with most of the shots being by Cameron himself with his virtual camera system, finally eliminating the \\"dreaded CG camera.\\" In some of the shots & zooms toward the end of the movie you can even feel Cameron's confidence, or maybe it's just joy- in what he's doing. The music is sweeping and outstanding as well, but also somewhat formulaic- which isn't a bad thing either. It's worthy to note that the score and editing/pacing of this movie almost trumps the visuals- and together it all comes off as very powerful. The motion capture of the actors, minus their tails and ears which were animated are incredible, taking Gollum from the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Davy Jones from \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" to the next level with totally surreal and believable face & emotion capture. Any and all \\"uncanny valley\\" feelings have been completely eliminated here. These characters feel even more real and alive than ever before on the big screen.    The true \\"Special Edition\\" due out later this year will feature the movie in three flavors: the original theatrical cut, the extended but completed +8-10 minute cut, and finally, a +40 minute cut featuring completed in animation/form yet unrendered, pre-visual additional scenes. The disk will also present us a Director's Journey as well as other interesting features & material showcasing the technology and people behind the movie. However, if you're into buying twice, have enough money, could care less, or simply lack enough patience like me, this version may be for you.
0385341008|5.0|The only thing wrong with this book is that there wasn't more of it!<br /><br />The idea of creating the story entirely from correspondences is a unique approach.  The characters are brought to life interestingly as you get to see how they respond to one another in their letters.  Their strengths, weaknesses, foibles, and triumphs are so poignantly brought to light.<br /><br />Getting into the swing of this little delight was odd at first, but it definitely grew on me and I was sad to see the ending.  But, the ending isn't sad at all - definitely worth the read!
B003S897UK|5.0|My favorite Mule era, the power trio with Warren, Matt, Matt and Woody. Still attend most shows in my area theses days. As a collector with over 150 Mule shows, this one might get played the most alond with 10/31 shows and other NYE shows. A fine opening set with Mule oldies along with a long Zep tune. Added guests as all Mule NYE shows are just a big plus. Great sound with vocals clear and a deep bass. I miss Woody. Sorry they haven't been the same since BUT still a fine band. I do love live recordings. Is it because of the Allmans' live at the Fillmore or all my DEAD bootlegs, LOL LOL
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase. It came in the condition described and arrived quite early within the time frame provided. Thank you!
1591791707|5.0|I must have listened to this CD a half dozen times. Often, when I am upset by the outcome of some conversation in my life, I'll find just the right chapter from this CD and a few minutes later I'll have the \\"Aha!\\" insight as to what went wrong in my conversation.    Marshall is hypnotic and enchanting - its worth the price to hear his voice.
B000002H6C|2.0|The band's first of several missteps (Load, Reload and St. Anger being the others), ...And Justice for All became a classic in spite of its flaws.    First off, the production on this album is awful. The drums only occasionally sound like drums, mostly they sound mechanical and lifeless. The lack of bass, allegedly James' way of messing with Jason's head, causes the guitars to sound cold. The only thing Flemming Rasmussen didn't screw up were James' vocals.    The second problem are the songs themselves. Long for no apparent reason, especially \\"To Live is to Die\\" which has one verse buried among what seems like a dozen riffs and time changes. \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" and \\"Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" go nowhere slowly. The title track would have been good if had been two minutes shorter. \\"Blackened\\" has the same nuclear war theme as Ride the Lightning's \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" but without the latter's power and focus.    The only two songs I can tolerate twenty years after I first heard this record are \\"One\\" and \\"Dyer's Eve\\" and even \\"One\\" could have had a minute cut off its end. \\"Dyer's Eve\\" is a thrash classic that wouldn't have been out of place on any of Metallica's 3 previous albums and the kind of song they won't do again until \\"Fuel.\\"    So if Death Magnetic was your first Metallica album, do yourself a favor and don't let this mess be your second.
0805091742|5.0|This book is about the value of the \\"lowly\\" checklist.  It is written by a working surgeon, a two-time author, a contributor to the New Yorker, and a consultant to the World Health Organization on, among other things, checklists.  It is, as I write. the #1 best selling book on Amazon in the subcategory of Surgery.<br /><br />It talks about how checklists have, and are, in real life around the world saving lives, eliminating mistakes and saving hospitals and patients millions of dollars.  The breadth of the impact is extraordinary.<br /><br />While this book will be fascinating from a medical or social sciences perspective, and would make great cocktail party conversation fodder, that is not why I recommend you read it.<br /><br />Underneath that level of content, the book is about change, personal organizational and global.  It brings together various professions, beyond medicine to illustrate it's points.  It is also about quality, quality improvement and the value of documented work processes<br /><br />As a leader these two issues - change and quality are both highly important.  To read about them in an enlightened, entertaining and highly thought provoking way from a book that isn't completely \\"about\\" those subjects makes it even more valuable.<br /><br />This is a book to read and enjoy.  It may make you more interesting at your next dinner party.  It may change the way you think about health care and your next surgery.  It can also make a difference in your ability to lead.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.  Get your copy today.
B003L20ICE|5.0|Some of my explorations here include the movies I've seen and enjoyed.  Recently I saw \\"The Kids Are All Right,\\" starring Julianne Moore and Annette Bening.<br /><br />I was actually surprised when the movie came to my neighborhood mall, much less my city.  Here in the Central Valley, we are often left out of the mix when it comes to quirky movies (or anything even remotely unconventional).<br /><br />I had expected to enjoy it, but didn't have my hopes up too high, as sometimes I am disappointed. So imagine my relief to find that, not only did it surpass my expectations, but I was so into it that I wasn't bored for even a moment.  Sometimes movies that are about particular themes or topics will be predictable.  But not this one.  Even though there was the inevitable adolescent angst, followed by the search for the absent father, this one had the unique twist of a family headed by two \\"moms,\\" who had used a sperm donor.<br /><br />In fact, each mom had one of the kids and they both used the same donor.  Makes the search easier.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo starred as the \\"sperm donor,\\" who incidentally was quite interested in forming a bond with the kids.<br /><br />The kids invite him to their house with the moms and they all start to form a friendship of sorts.  Jules, the character played by Julianne Moore, has just started a landscape business, and  Paul (dad) conveniently hires her to landscape his yard.<br /><br />Okay, I saw the next bit coming...sort of.  But I won't describe what happens.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that a lot of chaos ensues.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, I most enjoyed the interactions between the family members and absolutely loved seeing the homey backdrop to the family moments. It doesn't hurt that the other mom, Nick, played by Annette Bening, is a doctor, so the digs are very nice indeed.<br /><br />I'm definitely preordering this DVD.
1892005034|5.0|Although it is not easy to assimilate linearly (i.e. in one sitting), this book's an indispensable reference for me. The listing of human emotions ALONE justifies the price of the entire book.  From rereading it, I've learned: emotional literacy, to readily identify my own judgments, and more.    For NVC learners, I recommend listening to Marshall on CD [[ASIN:1591791707 Nonviolent Communication]] - hearing his stories in that format allowed me to learn the material much better than the book.
0743497465|3.0|The story is fairly entertaining, fast and continuous, albeit a little far fetched, and drags on a bit.  By about 3/4 of the book, I've figured out who was the mastermind, since the book tries hard to make the other suspects seem so obvious.  Treat it for what it is, think of it as a B action movie, with good enetertainment value, and good for killing some time, just don't expect it to be a thought provoking one, and you'll enjoy it and not be disappointed.
B002ZG9918|2.0|\\"Step Up\\" taught us about the redemptive and freeing power of dance. It wasn't a particularly good or original lesson, nor was it a particularly good or original film, but at least what it had to say was clearly stated. \\"Step Up 2: The Streets\\" taught us the exact same thing, despite shifting the location from the studios and auditoriums of the Maryland School of the Arts to the streets of Baltimore, where, miraculously, street dancing was at the last minute accepted as a legitimate art form. Now we have \\"Step Up 3-D,\\" and while the location has changed yet again - from Baltimore to New York City - the message itself hasn't changed at all, and quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing it. I officially get the point; for some people, dancing is the only good thing they have going for them. Now that we've thoroughly established this, can we please find something else talk about?    What annoys me to no end is that the film does more than recycle a message. It also recycles a plot formula and waters it down in the process. This is pretty strange given the fact that there wasn't much of a plot to begin with. The original \\"Step Up\\" was basically a low-rent retread of Alan Parker's \\"Fame,\\" focusing heavily on the choreography and the music but skimping on the maturity and the introspection. In other words, it lacked the sense that we were glimpsing into the lives of real people in real situations. \\"Step Up 2\\" went even further in its whittling away of the plot, reducing genuine drama to a contrived dance off between street crews. Now that we have come to \\"Step Up 3-D,\\" the plot has become so thin and inconsequential that every scene evaporates from our memories, even before they end.    The only exceptions are the dance sequences, which are impressive to say the least. The choreographers, and there are many, stage a number of routines that push the actors to the limits of human endurance; they contort, kick, flip, jump, and spin so intricately, you'd almost swear their bodies were manipulated by computers. And then there's the film's big draw, its presentation in 3-D, which is - and it greatly pains me to say this - the best use of the process since \\"Avatar.\\" The dancers really did seem to be reaching out of the screen. I actually felt immersed in the environment. The final dance showdown is especially great to look at; apart from the 3-D effects, the heroes were decked out in suits rigged with flashing LED lights and lasers. They looked liked extras from \\"Tron.\\"    The plot: Robert Alexander III, a.k.a. Moose (Adam Sevani), has moved to New York City to attend NYU with his best friend, Camile Gage (Alyson Stoner), who just happens to be the little sister to Tyler Gage, played in the first and second films by Channing Tatum. Moose wants to major in electrical engineering, but he finds he that misses dancing, and soon enough, he runs into Luke (Rick Malambri), a street dancer who does a little filmmaking on the side. Moose goes off and spends the rest of the film struggling to juggle his academic life with his social life. Luke, meanwhile, lives with a group of nomadic street dancers in a loft/studio once owned by his parents, themselves aspiring dancers before their untimely deaths. Their way of life is threatened by both finances and a rival dance team, who are just plain mean. Into Luke's life enters Natalie (Sharni Vinson), who has great moves and thinks it would be a good idea for Luke to pursue filmmaking.    Would it surprise you to learn that everyone's future depends on winning a dance competition? If you can't see where the plot is going after ten minutes, especially if you've seen the first two films, then I suspect you would actually be surprised by the ending of a \\"Titanic\\" documentary or a biopic about Abraham Lincoln. This movie is contrived, clichéd, and ultimately unfulfilling, since the ending and everything leading up to it are hopelessly predictable. The thing is, I can say the exact same thing about all the films; thepeople behind them are so intent on repeating themselves that it transcends mere routine and becomes a form of monomania. I'm pointing a finger directly at Adam Shankman and Jennifer Gibot, the only two producers to have been involved in all three films. We get it, guys. Dancing is important to you.    There is one particular scene in \\"Step Up 3-D\\" that actually held my attention all the way through. It featured Sevani and Stoner dancing up and down the streets of a New York City neighborhood while a remixed version of Fred Astaire's \\"I Won't Dance\\" blares from the speaker of an ice cream truck; it was all done in a single shot, and the two actors never missed a beat. It was a triumph of editing, choreography, and music. Why couldn't the rest of the film be like this? Maybe then, there would have been a good reason for it to have been made. The writers, directors, and producers of the \\"Step Up\\" series have told the exact same story three times in a row. How many more will it take for them to finally realize that they have exhausted an already hackneyed idea?
B00005QBUK|4.0|This is my second pair, the older model had longer wires. This is why I only give 4 stars. An other foot or two would have been nice.<br />The sound is great and you hardly feel that you are wearing a headset.<br /><br />Still love the product :)
B003ITZBVI|4.0|The movie was definitely good, but when you can (not legally) just download it, the urge to actually purchase it outright is weighed down by price points. So, for me, what it comes down to are the special features. And this one came packing. Two full length \\"documentaries\\" on Dick Grayson and Jason Todd (All the Robins minus Tim Drake), the Jonah Hex minimovie (voiced by Thomas Jane and Linda Hamilton), and the sneak peek at Apocalypse all come packaged with this disc. And the digital copy to boot. Doesn't get better than this. I'd give it four and a half stars if I could, because it was nearly perfect. The action scenes were awesome, and they alluded to so much. Just an all in all satisfying film. If you want to do right by Warner Bros and DC,AND get a movie that is unequivocally brilliant, then you gotta buy this.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this!  I was reluctant to get this at first, but my 3 y/o DD loves TS and I couldn't help but surprise her with this cd. We play it almost everyday in the car and listen to it on the way to and from school, so needless to say, both Mom and daughter know ALL the words to ALL the songs!  Great music from a great artist :)

Now then the disc and case well first off my case had a broken snap so only the top part of the case closed and also it smelled like candy for some reason witch was actually extremely pleasant witch sucked like hell when i decided to replace the case with one that wasn't broken, and the disc well its it was perfectly new. and that's it that's my review.

0307346617|4.0|I am not a zombie fan.  Not at all.  But after repeated recommendations, I picked up a copy of World War Z on CD.  It was narrated and dramatized, featuring a full cast of characters.  The format is that of a documentary, a researcher sharing his interviews with individuals he met world wide while documenting the recent world wide out break of zombies, as well as the attendant war to eradicate them.<br /><br />The result is provocative and interesting.  While there are moments of the gruesome and macabe, more interesting is the though treatment given to the effect on society, the world, how it changes humanity, and how humanity responds.<br /><br />The book is insightful, and there were moments when I was tell my wife about parts I had just listened to when she would stop me and remind me that it was just a book, that it hadn't really happened.  And then I would realize that, sitting in my car listening to it, like dispatches from war front, it reminded me of NPR or This American Life or some other radio documentary.<br /><br />There is some strong language, and there is, as I mentioned, the occasional gory scene, but the focus is not on the macabre or the blood, but on the human aspect.  I recommend reading, or listening, to it, even if zombies are not, like they are not for me, your thing.

B001P50HOI|5.0|This CD simply blew me away.  After hearing Jon Anderson play with the Cleveland Youth Orchestra in May 2010, I was fascinated and moved with the creation of orchestra and Yes music.  I had seen this concert tour back in 2001/2002 and I knew it was something big, and really, once you listen to Close to the Edge, Gates of Delerium, and Ritual, you might agree that these masterpieces were created with the orchestra in mind.  I have been a long time Yes fan, but in my opinion, this CD is a classic and a must for any music lover's collection.

0345472640|5.0|Hal Moore's Air Cavalry get dumped in the middle of hell shortly after arriving in Vietnam. \\"Find the enemy and kill 'em\\" are his brief, straightforward and no nonsense orders. He and his troopers move out and land at Landing Zone X-ray at the base of the Choo pong massif mountains in South Vietnam.<br /><br />Occupying the inside of that same mountain is the same North Vietnamese battalion that finally ran the French out in 1954. Battle hardened communists looking to kill Americans \\"very much\\".<br /><br />So starts 56 hrs of hell in late 1965. 400 Americans surrounded almost immediately by 3000 or so PNVA, battle hardened soldiers. Moore narrates his own story and includes testimony from his officers, NCO's and lower ranks about their part in the battle. What they did and what they saw is a side of humanity many will never see. Joe Galloway, a photographer, enters the battle late after he bums a ride from Bruce Crandall one of the hero chopper pilots.<br /><br />The North Vietnamese had the \\"cause\\". They wanted their country unified under Northern rule and they would throw 10 men at each American until they drove the invaders out. The Americans were fighting to thwart off communism in a cold war world that saw the \\"threat from the east\\" in the shape of \\"The Big Red Bear\\".<br /><br />Hal Moore is an amazing man as is his co writer Joe Galloway. In fact every soldier, North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese and American that fought in Vietnam but especially at the battle of IA Drang, commonly referred to as the battle that changed the war.<br /><br />One thing I found that made this book more enjoyable for me was that I sketched out the battle as I read it. There is a lot of \\"on the left\\", \\"from the east\\", \\"to the west\\", \\"to our fronts\\" and, it's easy to get lost in the directional confusion (fitting word for battle). Sketching the lines as I read helped me to keep up and appreciate the hell of it all.<br /><br />A great book about an exceptional group of ordinary guys doing extraordinary things.<br /><br />Note:<br />I've seen Hal Moore on TV and in documentaries many many times. He seems the kind of guy who should be wandering around his small farm, smoking a pipe with his dog while his wife cooks dinner. Inside this mild mannered humble man is the soul of a warrior who understands war and understands killing.<br /><br />The Mel Gibson movie \\"We were soldiers\\" seems to have held true to the story written by Moore and Galloway. Kudos to Mel. However, the movie does not tell the story of the relief soldiers march to LZ Albany which had them engaged in another bloody and vicious fight for their lives.Hal Moore on TV and in documentaries many many times.

B00003CXB4|4.0|Very good example of standard Disney movie...not quite as much adult content as others (Pixar, etc), but very touching.  Broadway play is also excellent (saw it in NYC).  Highly recommended.  Not sure why Disney has pulled it from the shelves - undoubtedly so that they can reissue it at higher price.
0380733358|4.0|I found Ken Follett about 3 months ago and this is my 4th Follett novel and, like only one or two other authors, he consistently delivers thrilling content.<br /><br />World War II is the back drop to this spy thriller. The \\"Needle\\" is the nickname of the German spy working in England who is being hunted by the British MI5. He leaves a trail of death as he works his way North and ends up on a remote island off the Scottish coast.<br /><br />On his trail is a an MI5 officer who is close on his heels but time after time sees the needle slip away.<br /><br />On the remote island is a resourceful but lonely wife and mother. Lonely as her husband is confined to a wheelchair and has slowly slipped inside himself as his handicap leaves them frustrated physically once to often. She falls for the spy and enters into a torrid affair with him while her crippled husband goes about his sheep tending.<br /><br />She finally figures out what the needle is up to and takes matters into her own hands.<br /><br />Follett's pacing is right on the money for me and he keeps me hanging on every word. The paragraph lengths are just about right and the tension mounts relentlessly.<br /><br />This one I definitely recommend.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|In Mojo, Petty and the 'breakers present their finest work to date. It reflects a maturity and confidence setting it apart from their already legendary catalog.  Petty has been quoted as saying it was written \\"for the band,\\" and it shows.  Hard driving blues, soaring rock, swinging country.  Its rough, its sweet, its audacious. Campbell's guitar work is extraordinary throughout as he and the band pay homage to the likes of JJ Cale, the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin.  Meanwhile Petty is secured as as a master modern lyricist.  This thing has Grammy written all over it.  Play it loud, play it often, play it.
B0036TGSR6|1.0|The Ghost Writer is a propaganda film by Roman Polanski in the form of a triller. The film makes two points: one is that the CIA and the USA are ruthless, evil and criminal; and the other that the British Prime Minister is a CIA plant since his early twenties. Were it not for the PM doing the CIA's bidding, Britain would not have been America's ally in foreign policy matters, including the Missile Defense Initiative.  Although the premise that a top government official is a plant and working against his own country is interesting, the persistent CIA/USA bashing gets tiresome. The acting is OK, there is some suspense, but it is not a clever story. The CIA is clever enough to control a country's leader and thus, policy, yet their agents can be found on Google. There are other very dumb things. There is no escaping the feeling that Polanski, who co-wrote the screenplay with Harris, hates America and will use his position to brainwash people.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|This series on WWII is one of the most comprehensive documenteries available. Since the documentary was made in 1974 most of the WW II veterans interviewed were in their early fifties and sixties. Including a few high profile  individuals such as Albert Speer, Curtis LeMay, Arthur Harris and others. I especially like the addition of color footage. Something which was not part of the original series.  This World at War DVD collection is a must have for the WWII buff, educators of the conflict or anyone just interested in that period of time.   The only down side with the set I ordered. A few of the disks had problems with skipping.     Vincent T. Marchese
B001FB4VZS|5.0|My wife and I are big fans of Smallville ((or I should say were originally)). We started watching the show from the first air date, and really enjoyed it till about season 4. The story arc at that time made it apparent the then creative minds in control had no interest in taking Clark/Kal-el down the path of superman. Well, when they lost creative control and the new vanguard stepped in with the later part of season 7, we started watching and due to personal schedules missed most of season 8, we missed some great material. Thus, we ordered Season 8 and were blown away with the direction that they went with the stories, the drawn out and tired story arc of farm boy Kent was finally matured ((I mean how long can a mid 20's character still act like a teenager?)) and the road to being 'Clark Kent aka Superman' was taken. Though he is still going by the blur in the end of this season and into season 9, you can so feel now like never before that the 'Man of Steele' is coming to a fruition. This season is the beginning of more entertaining writing and special effects. If you loved the first 3 seasons, you will more than likely love this season and the next one.
0670034711|5.0|I recently finished reading \\"Eat, Pray, Love...\\" and am now looking forward to seeing the screen adaptation.  I've read various reviews and critiques of Ms. Gilbert's work.  I'm particularly fascinated with the notion that Ms. Gilbert's problems are narrow or non-existent and cannot possibly be grounded in the kind of suffering that say, a cancer patient would have.  If this notion were not so aggravating, it would be laughable.  In February of this year I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer.  I've since embarked on what I hope is the most difficult journey of my life.  I cannot even begin to describe life in the past 6 months.  But what I can say is that a very sick person will find comfort, hope, solace and peace wherever they can.  If I tried to imagine how many of us Ms. Gilbert has comforted with this work, it would be impossible.  Her frank discussion, clear prose, and unabashed self-examination in her writing have entertained me, broken my heart, made me laugh out loud, and finally, made me smile and sigh as I put the book down for the last time.  To pose the critics' questions another way - Is the comfort, insight and inspiration that I've drawn from this book in doubt simply because I have cancer and Ms. Gilbert does not? Definately not.

0525951652|3.0|I wanted to like Fall of Giants.  After all, what's not to like in a sweeping historical novel that takes place over the period encompassing the First World War?  That was a time, just over a century ago, when there were real class distinctions between the regular people and royalty, when European kings and queens married across houses and countries to solidify relationships, and when the first signs of unrest and anger in the working classes started to boil up.<br /><br />The problem isn't with the history.  In any book that is a historical novel focused so specifically on actual events, we already know the history - it's the characters and their interactions that make the story come alive and introduce us to new perspectives about the period.  The problem with Fall of Giants is that the characters are a little too thin and contrived, although believable, but they constantly interact in almost impossible ways and locations.<br /><br />For example, two peasant brothers in Russia are separated.  One leaves on a boat thinking he is headed for America and ends up in Wales.  The other remains and becomes radicalized by the growing demands for socialism.  The first eventually ends up in the US, marries far above his station, and angers his father in law who ensures he is drafted.  The brother that remains in Russian rises and becomes a commissar in the Army.  The brother in the US is eventually sent to - you guessed it - Russia to work with the White Army and encounters his brother.  If this were the only instance of incredible happenstance in the book, it could be overlooked.  But all of the significant characters are constantly meeting in the most unusual places and ways.  I understand that the resolution of the First World War caused much change, but the characters simply interact in ways that are almost Forrest Gump-like in their ability to be where the evolving action is happening.<br /><br />It's all here - the Christmas ceasefire when the British and German soldiers meet in no-man's land.  Of course two friends on opposite sides meet here as well.  The fall of the Russian government and the resolution of the War by Wilson.  The collapse of the German government and the start of the Weimar republic.  If you are a student of this period, the book highlights a number of famous, and not so well known events, like the US support of the White Armies in Russia.<br /><br />But we know the history, and the characters and their interactions aren't believable enough to overcome the forced and somewhat predictable plot. Will the German husband and the English lady, married in secret, meet again after the war?  Drumroll please...of course they will.  And so on throughout the book.<br /><br />You have to admire any book ONE of Three that is almost a thousand pages, but by blending too many stories and characters the author is forced to make the plot \\"work\\" rather than letting the story unfold.  There's a lot of effort in this work, but one leaves the book feeling like a good editor and a better plot would have made the book a lot better..

0307474712|4.0|This book is not great literature -- although it makes reference to several classics -- but nor is it lowbrow or 'chick lit'. It is summer reading for intelligent people.     Emma and Dexter quasi-hook up the night they graduate university and this book chronicles their subsequent friendship, year by year by showing us where each of them is on that date. What does one do with ones life? What happens to the ideals we have at 19? What happens to those who didn't have any plans at all? Where will we be in 10 years, or 20? Will my best friend always be my best friend? This book follows Emma's and Dexter's tackling of these questions both individually and through their friendship.    You absolutely get swept up in the question of \\"will they or won't they\\" and the suspense of \\"I can't wait to see what happens next\\". I finally got to a point where I just had to sit down and read all the way to the end.    I had some issues with the ending, but I think overall it works and I don't want to write a spoiler review! Highly recommended for an enjoyable, thoughtful read.
044656740X|1.0|Reviewer's background: Early 20s, educated, financially stable.    I read actively and to keep this review short in order to minimise time already wasted reading the book, do not bother to buy it. It is just an over hyped and marketed book filled with fluff and talk that can easily be summarised into one page in point form. No how-to, simply talk and useless repetitive anecdotes.    I do not even want to place it anywhere near my collection, neither am I keen to resell it, its the first book I have ever ever tossed into the bin.    For teenagers and young adults, read \\"Get your asset in gear instead.\\" Good, useful and quick read.
0312330537|5.0|This book is unlike any other. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Shantaram reads like a movie and the characters in are so well painted that the images are vivid; I felt like I was actually there while everything was taking place. Beautifully written; it's larger than life.
1439102937|1.0|Ugh. The only word to describe this book is awful.  The premise starts out fairly realistically, but goes pretty downhill from page 3.  There is no plot, no character development and no reason for anything that happens in this book.  The characters' lives do not interwine and do not relate to each other at all.  In fact, it doesn't even seem like they all like each other that much.  The author aims for a trio of best buds, but the story comes off like a trio of good acquaintances.  The idea of making a life changing pact is intriguing, but neither does it develop nor does it actually include all the characters in the book.  The ending is completely unbelievable.  Its almost as if the author suddenly had to wrap up the book quickly and decided to skip on a few important chapters.  I wonder if her editor had the same reaction to the manuscript as Leigh does to Jesse's in the book?    Only read this book if you absolutely have to. Otherwise, its a waste of ink, paper and your time, which you will never get back.
B001LF347E|5.0|I love this show. The dynamic between Merlin and Arthur is classic. You can see the lifelong friendship forming. Merlin is such a lovable character, you really connect with him as a person. There are little moments between Merlin and Arthur that just show a bond that was almost immediate, like brothers between them. There are many little moments in the show that make it seem like real life with a twist of magic.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis makes the complicated world of high finance much easier to understand.  The financial crash along with the mortgage crisis and so many defaults become very clear to the reader.  Bad loans, bad people and a market that didn't care, all sums up what happened in the Big Short.  But there is more.  The personal stories of the traders who saw the crash coming and profitted, boy did they profit.

B002VUFKG6|1.0|Just read Eat, Pray, Love And Committed back to back on my Kindle. To be brief, I loved Eat, Pray, Love and that is why I wanted to read Committed.  Had I known 3/4's of the book would be about every aspect of the institution of marriage, I would not have ordered the thing. It seems to me that Gilbert didn't have enough material to chronical Filipe and her journey to marriage (although she says the book was originally 500 pages) so she spent page after boring page on marriage.  I spent most of my time skipping through the extremely boring history (and more history, and more history) of the marriage thing.  Sorry, but I cannot recommend this book to any one - unless you are obsessed with the history of the institution of marriage....Please Liz - get back to story telling of your travels, which you do so well.

0307474712|2.0|I found the concept of revisiting two characters on the same day year after year, to be overtly contrived. There is some witty repartee between Dex and Em but not enough to sustain my interest throughout. Neither of the characters are particularly interesting and Dex, in particular, is self absorbed and insipid. Both Dex and Em fulfill societal cliches of young, white, urban professionals at certain points in their life. I absolutely felt manipulated and betrayed by the ending. I was mildly enjoying the book until the end, when I wanted to throw it against the wall. Do not waste your time on this book, you will end up disappointed.
B0036TGSR6|2.0|Somehow the British creative class have convinced themselves that the former labor Prime Minister, Tony Blair, overwhelmingly popular and elected twice, was some sort of lapdog for President Bush.  Probably closer to the other way round.  In fact, the American CIA was no lapdog of the former president, and never missed an opportunity to publicly undermine his policies, including issuing a ludicrous National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 arguing that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and had probably not restarted it.<br /><br />The fever-swamp fantasy that Blair was Bush's lapdog forms the basis of this leaden \\"thriller\\" from child-rapist Roman Polanski.  Even in my flu-addled condition, I could see the big plot twist coming about half an hour before the ghost writer figured it out, by googling and by finding a poorly hidden cipher in a manuscript.  I'm sorry, but this was not a good movie on any level.  To make matters worse, they had Brits playing Americans, and Americans playing Brits, none of which worked.  This would be a turkey even if the politics weren't so wrong.
B001FB563E|4.0|With the timing of this movie and \\"Book of Eli\\" being released so close together, and both dealing with a post apocalyptic, dystopian view of the future, it's difficult not to compare the two side by side. But whereas Eli, represents a more polished, Hollywood style approach, The Road is a dark, and dreary adaptation without any real moments of levity. Arguably, the book (which I have not read) doesn't translate too well here into a movie, you feel somewhat dropped in to a portion of the story, where the beginning is shown only in often confusing flashbacks without real explanation, and the rest of the story sort of meanders into desolation, but perhaps this is the intention. Like Eli, the film is heavily tinted, everything looks lifeless and grey, dead or dying, and the devastated landscapes and cities are very well portrayed. Mortensen as the main character, leading his son, on their trek \\"South\\" to the ocean, is as intense as ever, ragged, emotionally dogged, but resolute in survival, and tenacious in protecting his son from the horrors along the way.<br />It's a difficult film to like, I would say that I would be unlikely to watch this again for a long time, so I was glad I rented it first. It's also not a film to cheer you up, and whereas that's sounds like an obvious comment considering the subject matter, like the film itself, it seems relentless in piling on the futility, and misery.<br />So why 4 stars? Well the performances are excellent, particularly from Kodi Smit-McPhee as the son. It's also a lesson in humanity, where materialism and money has no value, a wake up call we could all do with from time to time. I also liked the tension and horror aspects of the movie, the marauding gangs, cannibalism and death being often played out off camera, or just with sound, not overtly graphic, but often even scarier most of the time.<br />The message of the film, I can't say. It's quite slow and feels long despite being just two hours, and as I said at the beginning almost stops before the story ends.<br />Difficult to categorize, but still a great movie on many levels.ps before the story ends.  Difficult to categorize, but still a great movie on many levels.
0670021652|3.0|Since I haven't read Eat Pray Love, I'm not sure whether I'm speaking about Gilbert's writing style on the whole or just what she did with Committed, but I'll say that I was displeased by the way she jumped haphazardly from topic to topic. Perhaps writing this book made her feel better about marriage, but reading it did absolutely nothing for me.

As if my Senior year in high school wasn't memorable enough, the tracks of this album are the theme songs of that era for me and a few of my close friends.

This album was always the first and last album to play in the CD player on the snowboarding trips for sure.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key was recommended to me by my sister, a lifelong avid reader. I, on the other hand, have a hard time getting through most current fiction.  Totally different experience with Sarah's Key. It is one of those stories to encourage me to my bed at night to once again go down that road and into the lives of others. A sweet story, a terrible story, and all the while a captivating encounter between reader and narrative.

0743454537|1.0|I only gave this book one star because I don't have the option to give no star. I have never written any review in my life but I felt obliged to write this review so that no one else would waste 10 dollars and a few hours on this book. This book is bad from the beginning to the end. The writer does not have the skill to carry such a complicated and heavy topic. Everything and everyone was poorly written, superficial and unpredictably predictable (unpredictable because one would never expect such cheesy plots from a best-seller). To make it worse, the writer added a very unrealistic sub-plot - the love story between the lawyer and the guardian, the kind of love story that not even a 15 years old dreamy girl would buy it - handsome rich popular boy fell in love with social outcast ugly girl, boy got a fatal disease and left the girl because he did not want her to suffer with him, girl hated the boy but also could not forget him or love him less, boy did not die and became a succesful lawyer and met the girl again 20 years later and they are still in love with each other, happy ending. I suspect the writer was only fulfilling her own teenage fanatsy through this sub-plot as it clearly does not add anything to the story. This book is an insult to any self-respecting reader. I am mortified when I learn that this book is a best seller and was made into a movie - how could anyone like this book is beyond me.

0385523386|4.0|I liked this book, the story of Piper Kerman's approximately one year spend in a federal women's prison after pleading guilty 10 years earlier to a drug/money laundering charge, I rate it a worthwhile read.<br /><br />Piper's wild child path into involvement in the international heroin trade, very interesting, right off the bat she answers the question of how a nice affluent educated white girl ended up in The Joint.<br /><br />Piper accepts responsibility for her actions.  She does harbor bitterness toward those who introduced her to the illegal drug trade and whoever \\"ratted her out\\", but in an interesting and unusual twist(wont say more or I'll spoil it), she makes a sort of peace with it toward the end of the book.<br /><br />The inanity of the mandatory minimum sentences for drug convictions (thank you Len Bias/Tip O'Neill)and what it has wrought both in Piper's first person opinion and through example by stories of  the plights of other prisoners she came to know is well said.<br /><br />The routines and rhythms and interactions of prison life, the personalities of various prisoners, guards and staff makes for a good read.  Also the myth of unwilling women being coerced/forced into lesbian sexually relationships is thankfully debunked.<br /><br />Good  telling of the tribal grouping  among inmates (black, white, Hispanic, and \\"other\\") though Piper seems to associate with and have friends among all groups.<br /><br />Piper greatly appreciates the support she received/receives from both friends and family and especially her then fianc&eacute; Larry Smith.  With Larry I must say I think the praise goes a bit over board or is expressed to the point of unnecessary repetition.  However I've never been in prison so perhaps such effervescence is warranted considering the circumstances.<br /><br />Before \\"self surrender\\" Piper studies up on how to survive prison life and is determined not to get played by inmate \\"hustlers\\".  I was a little disappointed she never mentions actual hustle attempts after that.  It would have been interesting for one or more examples of such attempts and how she  did or didn't fend them off.  It is my understanding such encounters are unavoidable for newly arrived convicts.<br /><br />Finally not to quibble but twice the same inmate's (a white drug addict from rural Pennsylvania) wrecked teeth due to the use of crack cocaine is mentioned.  I suppose that is possible but it is much  more likely she was addicted to methamphetamine (aka \\"crank\\" or \\"ice\\") which is both popular in rural areas and hell on teeth.eresting for one or more examples of such attempts and how she  did or didn't fend them off.

B00005RIKI|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's debut was hardly the work of a naïve and inexperienced band but a record produced by an entity that had made their bones on the stages and in the recording studios throughout the South. In fact, \\"Pronounced\\" was not in reality their first album but was in fact their first released LP after their initial debut failed to get picked up by a record company. However many of those sessions, famously recorded at Muscle Shoals Studios in Alabama would bear some of the fruit on the first record as \\"Free Bird\\", \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", \\"I Ain't the One\\" and \\"Simple Man\\" had been demoed as early as that 1971-72 period. The classic finished versions of those songs along with other with the unforgettable \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" make `Pronounced Lenerd Skinnerd' one of rock's greatest records; debut, Southern or otherwise. It could be the best Southern album ever made and but it definitely is Skynyrd's finest hour. Recorded as a six piece under the auspicious guidance of rock vet Al Kooper, the band had temporarily lost their permanent bassist Leon Wilkerson who had written the bass parts to the songs and Ed King was recruited to play bass on the album. Leon soon rejoined (he of the huge dark shades on the cover) and King became the band's third lead guitarist and the trademark guitar sound of the band was complete. \\"Free Bird\\" needs no further description of its legendary status but I prefer \\"Simple Man\\" as the Skynyrd anthem I could not do without. All eight songs on this legendary opus matter as even \\"Mississippi Kid\\" and \\"Poison Whiskey\\" add to the luster. The late great Ronnie Van Zant was the undisputed leader of this group of raucous rebels and he never shined better than on this magical first LP.  Fly on Free Bird.....
B000JO9Y6I|5.0|Dexter Morgan - blood Spatter Expert and Serial Killer. He's been living a double life for a while now and has kept that paart of himself shelves and out of the way. The only person who knew was someone from his past, and that person taught him a great many things on staying alive in such a mad world. Dexter also has a squad of people aroudn him you will get to know, a sister you will get to know even more, and a case you will grow to love featuring The Ice Truck Killer. In this episode we see Dexter (and see the overlap better book 1 and this season) and the way he sees blood, not to mention the Dark Passenger. We also see the ITK and the way he kills and the way Dexter admires the person's style.<br />Its like living in Dahlmerland - that's how the book put it - except there are no rides (thank goodness).<br /><br />M.C. Hall is the PERFECT Dexter. After 3 seasons of him I can say he is the reason that Dexter connects with people and is not a monster to us. Watch the show - you will see. Jennifer C - his sister Deb - is also a unique personality here and you will grow to enjoy her. She has a sailor's mouth and keeps in shape and loves to pick the wrong type of people. She plays it to a tee. And the rest of the cast are great as well and, if you think you know how it all ends because you read the book, you are wrong. The book and this are different in a lot of ways AND the end is a strong part of it. So, readers, watch this as well.<br /><br />Closing this up, the twists and turns are great and learning about Dexter's past is a wild ride. You learn a lot in this season, too, and you see how Dexter was \\"made.\\" You also see other things, bits that are spooky and the things he does away with, making you wonder exactly what the Dark Passenger is doing riding shotgun with Dexter.<br />So many rules - so many graves. He is in the perfect place to be himself, that's for sure.
160094048X|5.0|I bought this book at a vegan animal sanctuary last year.  They had made cupcakes from the other book, \\"Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World\\" and they were so delicious!!  I wanted my hands on some yummy cookies so I bought this book.  I made the 'Caramel Delights' and my fiance (who is not vegan) ate all of them in one sitting.  He keeps asking me when I will be making them again so he can eat another batch, haha!  I can't wait to try the blondies, they look delish!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a great book!  I haven't laughed or cried over a book like this in years.  Enzo endears himself to you in the first chapter as you wish you were a dog yourself.  You will never look at your dog the same again. What does he really think when you talk to him, and what would he really say to you if he had the opportunity!  Garth Stein is a genius and surely was once a dog and earned his human life.  A great summer read that will make you appreciate your opposable thumbs!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I tried recording a few audio and it has been wonderful. But I am still having issues with couple of things. When I connect the output to my 5DMarkII there is a hissing sound and somewhere it is mentioned that I need a 25 dB attenuation cable or something. Not sure as of now on how to get the sound to record directly to the camera. I have the latest firmware on the camera. Secondly, they should do something about the windscreen. They should bundle the redhead windscreen with this recorder. The one provided with the product is pretty much useless to my knowledge. Need to do some testing with external microphones before I can provide a decent update.
0345349571|5.0|Initially I bought this book to gift a history student who requested it.  Before I could give it to him I started to read it and became so captivated that I kept the book and bought him another book!  What was wonderful about this history was the way Tuchman brought together the social,  economic, religious and artistic influences of the period and how the Black Plague    disrupted life throughout Europe. This book is not for those who want a light, quick  overview. There are many footnotes supporting the work.  The few times where the references were few or non-existent, Ms Tuchman tells the reader those parts and how she dealt with it.     While reading on a plane a woman beside me commented that some books are merely to be read, while \\"this book is to be read, chewed and digested.\\" She was right.  This book opened up the 14th century like no other.  One note of warning; the papacy and what was going on with the Catholic Church during this time was quite an eyeopener and this may explain some of the low marks by some reviewers.
B003XU02QG|5.0|This movie is well worth watching but I don't feel it was worth a fee of 9.99 if your going to do this more often you need to price the movie better if you expect to keep people coming back for furture (pre release movies) I would recommend waiting until the price comes down before buying this movie.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Regardless of what you may have heard, there was a time when Linkin Park was cool.  Yes, I know...but you say \\"they are cool now\\" and I retort with \\"eh, not so much.\\"  No, I am not a fan of their third album (not counting the remix versions of `Hybrid Theory' and `Meteroa'), but I am quite the fan of this (not so) small effort.<br /><br />I'm not going to dwell on this review (this is so not like me) simply because I'm a little pressed for time, but I wanted to pinch this one off.<br /><br />When they hit it hard, they present their best work.  `Don't Stay' is a blisteringly strong opener.  `Lying From You' and `Hit the Floor' are ferocious and serve up the best tracks on the album.  The fluid mix of rap and rock is present here to full effect.  `Faint' is strong and memorable.  `Nobody's Listening' is a unique and fun track, using the fliut as the main instrument and it works exceedingly well.<br /><br />Experimental tracks like the popish `Breaking the Habit' and the melodramatic `Easier to Run' come off with mixed results.  They are ambitious and commendably so, but they don't come together completely.<br /><br />`Somewhere I Belong' was a nice choice for a single, even if it kind of bores me.  It just isn't that striking.  It seems a tad repetitive and lazy, like they didn't give it much thought.  `Figure.09' is strong, yet reminiscent of some of their better work and so it tends to pale in comparison (if comparisons are made).  `Numb' was a huge hit for them, but like `Somewhere I Belong', it seems to strike me as a lesser effort.  `From the Inside' has heart and works better than `Easier to Run' in the ballad department (it doesn't come off as desperate).<br /><br />Of course, `Session' is just noise, but it's a nice upgrade from the noise they offered us on `Hybrid Theory'...it gives us perspective on who they are as a band.  I think that's why I've distanced myself from them since they dropped that `Minutes to Midnight' album.  They have evolved into something that seems foreign to them.  Here's to hoping that their evolution took them somewhere more comfortably exceptional on their latest album, due out very soon.Here's to hoping that their evolution took them somewhere more comfortably exceptional on their latest album, due out very soon.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Based on the popular novel series.  They changed the ages of the main characters as well as some of the story angles which decreased my enjoyment of the picture.  There are a lot of big names in this piece but I think what could have been a a great movie is only somewhat good at best.  Too much focus on CGI and the like and not enough on plot points which connect fluidly.  Most of the actors and actresses do a commendable job.  In addition, this is a good starting point for kids learning about Greek Mythology.  All said, the first book is better.  Best supporting actress was Uma Thurman as medusa.  She had the best line, too, when she told the main character, \\"Son of Poseidon.  I used to date your Daddy.\\"  MY GRADE: B minus to B.
0783240236|5.0|When you hear the name Alfred Hitchcock, there are a few movie titles that instantly jump into your mind (most notably, `Vertigo', `Psycho', `Read Window' and `The Birds').  Of those four films (or more depending on how much of an enthusiast you are), `The Birds' is probably the one that most people have seen.  You don't have to be a devotee to the Hitchcock fan club to have seen `The Birds'.  For me, I remember fondly the many times I saw this film as a child.  I watched this movie almost religiously in my home.  It was the only `horror' film my parents would allow me to watch, and what young boy doesn't crave to watch some sort of horror movie.<br /><br />I soaked this one in, and what is great is that in my adult years I can see this film for so much more than I did in my youth.  While `The Birds' has certainly become a cult favorite, a film that circulates the tongues of many people for various reasons, but it is also a film that stands tall on its own merits.<br /><br />It is not a mere `scary movie'.<br /><br />This film is actually riddled with a keen sense of intelligence and a stark expression of depth that one may initially shrug off because of its genre.  That is sad because of all of Hitchcock's many masterpieces this may be the most complex when you consider the many layers he was able to flesh out with his lens.<br /><br />When watching `The Birds', our initial interpretation will most likely fall into the vein that this has everything to do with the winged demons raging havoc on the town, but upon further reflection it becomes all the more obvious that the film has absolutely nothing to do with the birds at all.  In fact, they are a mere tool used to bring our attention to the films core, that of the human relationships seemingly effected by the trauma.  Hitchcock was never one to lend his talent to a mere `cheap thrill'.  In fact, he always grounded his films, using tension and dread and `horror' to build a foundation for more deeply rooted emotions.  `The Birds' is a brilliantly staged character study, one that delves into the feelings of complacency, jealousy and eventual understanding (or would that be apathy).  Taking the family structure build with the characters within the film, Hitchcock unleashes on us a tale of aggression that spans all spectrums of the equation.<br /><br />`The Birds' is physically and emotionally brutal.<br /><br />By using a near unknown in the lead, Hitchcock was also able to create a sense of realism that may have been lost in a big star.  I am not one who feels as though this is always the case.  You will never hear me squabble over the fact that Kate Winslet has a big juicy part because as an actress she transcends her celebrity, but there are some actresses who fail to play anything but a mere variation of their persona.  Tippi Hendren had no persona before this film, and so her lack of celebrity only aided her in building such a remarkably sincere character.<br /><br />In the end, `The Birds' will always be one of the greatest `horror' movies around, but it is deeper than that and it deserves to be regarded as such.`The Birds' is a brilliantly staged character study, one that delves into the feelings of complacency, jealousy and eventual understanding (or would that be apathy).

B001UV4XUG|4.0|I liked this movie, but did not love it which is why I passed it on to a friend with the message 'pass it on to someone else'. The plot is about a guy who experiences the ups and downs in his relationship with a girl named Summer. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel were great as the boyfriend and Summer. The supporting cast was good. Dialogue was realistic. Cinematography was good.<br />The negatives? Mostly for me it was the script. The scenes seemed to bounce around in a non-chronolgical order that took a little time to get used to. The end result unfortunately gave away the ending. There was no real element of surprise because the viewer was able to figure out where the main characters were coming from.<br />For what it's worth, this was a good movie but also one that is fairly easy to forget.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|very,very,very impressive comeback i like almost the entire album!! and this a first<br />for me because usally em only has like maybe 6 cuts per album but this one OMG!<br />I WOULD SAY 10 AT MOST!what a great production he did on this one the beats are hipnotic and tight and it takes you what he's going through in the industry as well as his personal life as well i kinda feel sorry for him but as many friends as he has in the industry somebody should reach out or something but he sounds like old em again and happy. this album is money well spent. NO REGRETS!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie should come with a bonus pillow, because you are going to need one before the end. Seriously, this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It is over long and drawn out to the point where most people in the cinema where I made the mistake of initially seeing it were struggling to stay awake by the time the actual attack began. Admittedly the scenes which feature the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are impressive from a CGI point of view but tend to look more like an intro sequence to a video game than anything resembling reality. One low flying sequence in particular has the P40 fighters behaving like flying saucers in some cheap 50's Sci-Fi movie. While I realize that some artistic license is required in the making of this type of movie and that some historical inaccuracies or omissions will occur, this is almost comic book stuff. It is a convenient fact that only two American fighter aircraft managed to get off the ground and engage the Japanese on that day but to suggest that these were two childhood buddies and that they both then somehow managed to fly in Doolittle's raid on Japan is insulting to those who actually did. But in the end this sums up this movie, it is a formula American buddy movie that contains all the attributes that makes these types of movie so dire and cringe worthy. Why they named it Pearl Harbor is beyond me when that event only took up such a small portion of the movie. To call it that would suggest an attempt to document the actual events surrounding this historically important event but this is lame romantic claptrap that just uses it as a backdrop. If you want to see a movie about the subject then try Tora, Tora, Tora. There are some fine performances in this film, which must have been hard given the dire nature of the script. Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent in his role as real life hero Dorrie Miller but Ben Affleck gives his usual impression of a block of wood in a gorilla mask. I would not waste my money on this DVD nomatter how cheap it gets and I'd advise anyone reading this not to waste nearly three hours of their life watching it. Avoid!
0307454541|2.0|Full disclosure: This review is based on the abridged audio discs. I know that's annoying, but at least I endured the entire thing before writing a review!<br /><br />This had to be one of the most boring, contrived, exposition-laden tales I've ever heard. It's true that there is a lot of rape and sexual deviance, which apparently really upset some people. Honestly though, it's not anything more inspired than an episode of Law and Order SVU. In fact, ***SPOILER ALERT*** I was less upset by one of the main female characters being raped and more upset that her solution was to rape her attacker. This is supposed to show a strong female character?! The way she does it sounds more like a male BDSM fantasy; it's in no way empowering or feminist. Speaking of this character, everyone seems to love her for her amazing abilities despite severe social difficultues (implied to be Asperger's). I agree she's cool, although definitely a little cliched. But I was disappointed at the end ***STILL A SPOILER ALERT*** when she performed an epic heist which involved lots of acting, flirtatious smiles, and confidence. I get it, she's a genius, but an antisocial genius is still antisocial! I can suspend disbelief on her hacking or investigative powers, but I had a tough time believing a girl who can barely look someone she likes in the eye could suddenly put on a wig and pretend to be a devil-may-care heiress. Furthermore, the main male character gives off some sort of pheromone or something, bcs every single woman wants to sleep with him, including the aforementioned main girl. Remember, not only does she suffer from a social disorder, but she's a recent victim of violent rape. And yet, next thing we know, she's with the main character, biting at his chest and declaring it will just be about sex, even as she falls hopelessly in love with him. Just like every other woman in the story. Never mind that she had (to this point) always been wary of love due to years of abuse (and... you know... that recent atrocious rape), and she had known this guy for a couple weeks only. I'm sorry, but the whole thing reads like a personal male fanfic. END SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I had guessed (correctly) the solution to the big mystery when it was first explained to the main character, that's how contrived it was. All of the other mysteries (Nazis, industry corruption, MORE Law-and-Order-calibur BDSM) seemed tacked on and pointless. All of the discoveries seemed totally random and deus ex machina-y. I was rolling my eyes a LOT. And while some of the exposition was interesting, there was waaay too much of it. Especially without having a family tree (which I guess you get in the book), it was hard to keep track of all the family members (good thing 90% of them are unimportant). And there's a lot of industry backstory that seems completely unnecessary; granted, it forms part of the tacked-on mystery I mentioned, but there's no need to go into such excrutiating detail over it!<br /><br />This was totally not worth the hype. And I'm embarrassed that I fell for it. I hate to say it, but I wonder if the popularity has anything to do with the death of the author or something. I just don't see how this book can stand on its own merit. If there was no hype about TGWTDT and I had stumbled upon it in the library or something, I maybe would have enjoyed it slightly more bcs I wouldn't have had expectations. However, I would not have recommended it, reviewed it, or even really thought of it once it was over. It was that dull and uninspired. It's only worth a review now bcs of all the hype, which it does not deserve, in my opinion.recent atrocious rape), and she had known this guy for a couple weeks only.

1400049628|3.0|I enjoy survival guides. I don't know why, but I guess it's the idea of human vs nature and coming out on top that attracts me to them. Of course, The Zombie Survival Guide won't help you if your plane goes down in the forest or your Jeep blows a tire on the African Savanna, but it will amuse the hell out of you for a few hours. Max Brooks does an awesome job at creating his Zombies and spends an entire chapter explaining their psychology and physiology. He then goes on to craft a survival manual around those rules, which is really what makes it interesting. Brooks' zombies are the slow, shuffling, brainless zombies of classic horror movies and legend. They don't run, they don't climb, they can't think. But they also don't get hungry or tired, they don't breathe or feel negative effects from the environment, and this makes them the perfect hunter. At first, I thought, you know, they don't seem to scary. You can out walk these things and if you have a bike then you're set. Of course, Brooks' blew my survival plan out of the water, though, apparently a bicycle is an acceptable form of transportation during an outbreak so I'd be OK. I found this book in the humor section of my bookstore but I'm not totally sure it belongs there. Obviously, this book is humorous (Zombies attacking, that's ridiculous)but it's much more an amusing, interesting funny than a laugh-out-loud funny. I found myself really considering some of his strategies in the case of a possibly outbreak, and it's written with a certain severity and seriousness that occasionally makes you cringe, but in a good way, in a, wow, that guy has a really good point and it's kind of uncomfortable to think about, kind of way. If I was just grading this book on the survival guide, it would get a 5/5 without a doubt.  However, it's really hampered by the last 60 pages or so, where Brooks goes into detail about all, or most, of the recorded outbreaks in history. Most of them read the same way and are just set in different locations. For example:  Location A 1400AD: Person bit, enters city looking for help, reanimates, kills part of population, locals blame it on mythology/legend/magic  Location B 1950AD: Person bit, enters city looking for help, reanimates, kills part of population, government comes in a covers it up or calls survivors crazy and it's all part of their imagination.    The last 60 pages could easily have been trimmed down and I really feel like it was just an excuse for filler to make the book a little more substantial in terms of page numbers and word count, which could have been done with appendices, survival scenarios, and the like. The first part read extremely well, was interesting and surprisingly informative for a fictional account of a hypothetical zombie outbreak, and was a fun little brain teaser when you play \\"what would I do\\" with all the puzzle pieces Brooks supplies you with. The second part, however, really changed the tone of the book, was repetitive, and didn't mesh well with the rest of the book and is really what brought it down for me. I spent the first few hours of reading wishing for more, and the last few wishing it would just hurry up and end. Some of the stories were entertaining, like the idea that Roanoke was the result of a zombie outbreak, but other than that, it was nothing special. It's kind of like a superhero having a loser sidekick and it just can't totally recover. Still, a worthwhile read. You might just want to skim the last 60 pages.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come on DVD.  Watched it in the movie theatre when it was released. What a memorable experience. The book is intense enough, but the movie is in a faster pace.  The story moves so fast that it keeps you on the edge the whole time.  The two leading actors are excellent. It has to be one of Pierce Brosnan's best performances on screen.      Another excellent player in the movie is the weather.  It sets the tone in various scenes, drizzles, rain, storm and everything in between. What a beautiful movie to watch, again and again. Will definitely own the DVD.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I read the book first which was very good and the movie lived up to the book. Leonardo Decaprio is great as usual and the plot is intriguing and believable.
0446618322|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.  His books stay on my mind long after I finish reading them, and this book was no exception.  I love the concept of this story and especially enjoyed learning about the characters with all of their human flaws.  Clayton was one of the best villians I've read in a long time.  He was so realistic as a control hungy, sexist, ex-husband, who was especially abusive with his police powers.  Nicholas Sparks definitely did his reseach on this one.    Cons: This book is predictable with an overly dramatic ending, seemingly created directly for the big screen.  I also didn't like how quickly Elizabeth turned on Logan, but that may be more of her character's flaw than a writing flaw.
B001HN694K|5.0|I'm biased because I adore Johnny Depp but this is a good DVD to have on hand. Johnny Depp's character is so goofy and yet well developed. The cinematography is detailed and fun. Helina Bonham Carter is fantastic as the Red Queen. Alice's actress grows on you by the end of the movie.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This film is one for the ages. For two characters to be able to carry a film, along with the story, directing, and music, wow, that takes creativity. There's no explosions, car chases, dramatic love scenes. But what you have, is what Hollywood films are missing these days, A GREAT STORY. You basically have two locations and two main characters. I think that was genius to be able to pull it off the way they did. Of course they had practice since it was initially a play. If you want to see a Great Story, check this one out.
0439023483|5.0|I bought this book yesterday and started reading it at 8pm. I was transfixed. I continued to read until 12am at which point I decided that I was in for the long-haul. I finished it at 2am. The first thing I did this morning was make a run for the bookstore.<br />My point is: this book is so freaking good that I couldn't put it down. The main character is likeable, fully-developed, and kick-ass. The supporting characters are also captivating. The story of the survivor-like \\"hunger games\\" is mesmerizing and facinating. Part love story, part sci-fi, part man v man adventure.<br />All I have to say is, if you buy Hunger Games, go ahead and buy the other two books as well--you're not going to want to let Katniss go after the first one and you don't want to have to wait for another order.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Nightmare just plain kicks butt. I honestly love every song on this album, it's been a long while since i could say that. Couple of slower songs, but even those are so melodic and heavy, i still can't keep from nodding my head with the beat. Sad for me to say this with what happened to Rev (and i think he was an amazing drummer), but in all honesty, Portnoy is part of what put this cd over the top for me. I play guitar and always am listening most to what the guitarists are doing, but what Portnoy does with the drums is just unreal. And i even knew what to expect, being a fan of dream theater. The guitars and bass are flawless (of course) and Shadows' vocals rock in this as well.    If it helps some of you looking, some of my favorite metal bands are metallica, megadeth, ozzy, iron maiden, and (yeah, it's prog) dream theater. A7x keeps with the formula used by some of those bands and adds a modern feel to it, and it just works. If you like those bands i mentioned and are looking for something new (without the singer just screaming), without a doubt you need to check this cd out. If you prefer thrash or death metal, you'll probably be let down... this is heavy, sometimes fast, but always melodic. Their previous two albums are right up there with Nightmare, but this one stands out for me. Awesome. Just awesome.
B000M9BPEY|3.0|Based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace, Big Fish tells the story of William Bloom and his reconciliation with his dying father through the stories he used to hear from his father when he was a kid. This is without a doubt one of my favorite Burton films, filled with visual moments that follow the 'Burton formula' but with a story that goes way too far from your average Burton movie. Many reviews already exist about the film itself so I will now proceed to talk about the release and explain why I gave this only 3 stars being a favorite film of mine.<br /><br />THE MOVIE<br /><br />The movie is presented in anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Color is generally consistent and looks well in HD, but not as well as it should . It would seem a if the film has been manipulated as there is a softer look in it that I do not remember seeing at the theater; close ups that should normally look detailed look way too soft and with a 'waxy' effect. Scenes that I was looking forward to see in high detail look dull and not as they should for a Bluray release (the circus sequence, the whole arrival to Spectre or the daffodil scene are two examples that come to mind) The video quality is indeed an improvement over the existing DVD, in color at least, but there is no doubt this could have looked way better than it does in this release.<br /><br />Audio tracks included are uncompressed English PCM 5.1 (which sounds incredible in the few scenes that take advantage of an HD sound system), English and French 5.1. Subtitles included are English, English SDH, French, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai<br /><br />THE EXTRAS<br /><br />Prior to getting this, I owned the existing DVD release that included among the extras an audio commentary with director Tim Burton, some mini documentaries about the story and the characters as well as some other features hidden as 'Easter eggs'. Well, all those extras but the director commentary are gone in the Bluray disc. The hidden extras are also nowhere to be found, so the director commentary is pretty much the only extra feature included in this release. If you, like me, have heard a Tim Burton commentary before, you may already know you cannot expect great things from it nor interesting information, Burton passes most of the time silent and when he talks it is usually to make a joke or point out something that may not be relevant at all.

0385523904|3.0|If you're looking to get an understanding of North Korea - its politics, economy, government, living conditions, etc., then you might find a better read.  The author focuses on the lives of North Koreans that have escaped and what they experienced while there.  It can get a little to heavy into the family and love relationships of the refugees, which I see as useless romance novel bibble babble.  But there is enough of a peak into North Korea to make it worth turning the next page.

B000B5XOSO|4.0|In the original, Batman (Michael Keaton) had the deal with the hijinks of the nefarious Joker. Now, he's got two villains to deal with, one worse than the other. The first is the Penguin (Danny Devito), a sewer-dwelling freak with bird-like hands whose cruelty by his parents have turned him a psychotic madman. The other is Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), a femme fatale in a swanky cat suit whose alter ego is Salina Kyle. She has a going for Batman and the two form a love-hate relationship that is the emotional core of the movie.<br /><br />With greater creative control, Tim Burton transforms Gotham City into a darkly repressive, visually imposing landscape of towering skyscrapers and gothic grandeur. More than the first movie, BATMAN RETURNS recalls not just film noir but the German expressionist works of Murnau, Weine, Wigman, Lang and Eisner in its angular building designs, severe-looking city squares and expressive shadows. The production design, beautifully laid out by Bo Welch (who also worked with Burton on Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice), is one of the main attractions of the movie.<br /><br />The other attractions are, of course, the main characters. As Batman, Michael Keaton makes the role into his own. He is a loner that cannot understand the real world and in which the real world cannot understand him. Batman defends the city like a dark knight caught between the webs of his personal demons and the demons on the streets. Danny Devito's Penguin is a vile creation, a pitiful baddie whom we feel pity for because if he were raised by proper parents, he would not become this monster that bites men's noses, grab stuff from people's toilets and have his clown gang run amok in the city.<br /><br />But the movie is stolen by Michelle Pfeiffer, in a breakout role as the Catwoman. Beginning the movie as a repressed mouse-like Salina Kyle, her near-death experience by her boss Scheck (Christopher Walken) pushes her over the edge and reveals her feminine, aggressive tendencies to become Catwoman. In a striking segment, Salina destroys her pink, oppressive apartment with uncontrollable rage, breaking dollhouses, stuffing plush toys in a sink and spraying walls with black ink.<br /><br />A symbol of feminism unleashed, Catwoman becomes both Batman's soul mate and enemy. Like Bruce Wayne, Kyle is deeply scared by her personal demons: subjugation, torment by her sadistic boss, the lack of men that she no longer marries. Now here is this man that is a lot like her: a human being who dons his suit and looms over the city like a ghost ready to attack those that oppose him and murdered his parents. Out of their suits, however, these two freaks become miniscule figures in a city that is oppressive and immense.<br /><br />Perhaps it is no surprise that BATMAN RETURNS, while a huge hit, failed to meet box-office expectations when it was released. Its brooding tone, unorthodox characters and utter grimness made it too upsetting for children and too unusual for the adults. Some complained that it felt more like a Tim Burton movie than an actual BATMAN movie, which was actually the point. Burton's sympathies towards the abnormal and misunderstood is recurring theme in his work, none more so than in BATMAN RETURNS. Each of the three main characters are victims of a detached, over-assertive society that has robbed them of a chance to live their life at their fullest. Batman, because of his parents' murder; The Penguin, because of his parents' cruelty; Catwoman, because of her oppression and, subtly, her mother's domineering behavior. In the end, BATMAN RETURNS is less of a comic-book superhero movie than a Freudian tragedy with expressionistic characters.<br /><br />BATMAN RETURNS is an impressive, multifaceted action movie that is both mentally stimulating and viscerally entertaining, a rare mixture done right. Unfortunately, all that complexity disappeared when Joel Schumacher took over the director's chair and descended the franchise intoCamp Bat Nipples. But the legacy of Burton's two BATMAN movies has stood the test of time and continues to spawn the same kind of bat magic that it did back in the early 1990's.<br /><br />BATMAN RETURNS is currently available both separately and part of the BATMAN ANTHOLOGY 1989-1997 set, which contains Burton's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS and Schumacher's tasteless BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN & ROBIN. One does not have to guess which pair of movies is better.Camp Bat Nipples.

0307454541|5.0|The first few pages of this book were disappointing...seemed a bit dry an uninteresting, but once the story turned the corner I could hardly put it down.  I was drawn into the mystery and the twists and turns and surprises.  I also found it a bit scary the things a computer hacker is capable of.  Now I have to read the other two to find out Lisabeth's story.<br />  Such a shame these three will be the only legacy from this author.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Batman: I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me.<br />Nic: What are you?<br />Batman: I'm Batman.<br /><br />1989 was the year when Tim Burton and Warner Bros. introduced the world to the dark knight. Unlike many action and superhero movies that have become dated and whose only main interest lies in nostalgia, time has done nothing but burnish the dark beauty of Burton's dazzling portrait of the creature of the night, looming over Gotham City like a guardian angel. Buy this DVD and it is guaranteed that this movie will be looming over your head for a long time.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is outstanding as the tormented Bruce Wayne, who became Batman after the slaying of his parents by criminals when he was young. Wayne may be fabulously wealthy but his finances mean nothing to his despair that has haunted him from his childhood. When donning the bat-suit, Wayne channels his anger and emotions towards the scum on the street.<br /><br />But a new villain has arrived and is taking the spotlight away. This new menace is the Joker / Jack Napier (played by Jack Nicholson at his diabolical best), the dangerous clown prince of crime wrecking havoc and preparing to take control of Gotham City. These two men are fighting over the soul of Gotham City, one that, to quote Commissioner Gordon, is \\"synonymous with crime\\".<br /><br />Burton had already achieved success before with PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE and BEETLEJUICE but Batman was his first go at a major blockbuster. Unsurprisingly, the movie is not as personal as Burton's previous offerings or even the sequel, BATMAN RETURNS. There are loads of action, comedy and bravura set pieces in Batman (including a dynamite sequence at the cathedral near the end). There is even a romantic subplot between Wayne and Katie Vick (Kim Basigner) that is dull and uninvolving. But that is not Burton's main concern. His main goal is to create a world that is as alive and dangerous as the criminals running amok.<br /><br />And that world is Gotham City, a dangerous, monolithic metropolis that engulfs its citizens with its large mass, towering structures, chemical plants, claustrophobic alleys and crime organizations. Designed by the late Anton Furst, Gotham City is one of the richest settings since the cities in Blade Runner and Brazil. Like those cities, it is an expressive environment seething with crime, corruption and chaos.<br /><br />The performances are generally excellent, from Michael Gough adding comic relief as Wayne's butler Alfred to Jack Palance making a memorably brief appearance as crime boss Carl Grisham. But the movie belongs to Jack Nicholson, who transforms the Joker into a comic terror unleashed. In fact, some people complained that there was too much Joker and not even Batman and that the movie should been re-titled Joker. But that helps make Batman's appearances even more dramatic. When Batman crashes down through the ceiling of an art museum, the feeling is cathartic after numerous waits.<br /><br />BATMAN is one of the few superhero movies that still works, even in an era dominated by IRON MAN, SPIDER-MAN and, of course, THE DARK KNIGHT. While THE DARK KNIGHT may have been hugely successful, it is in the original where the bat magic truly exists.<br /><br />BATMAN is currently available both separately and part of the BATMAN ANTHOLOGY 1989-1997 set, which contains Burton's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS and Schumacher's tasteless BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN & ROBIN..

B000V6BE6M|5.0|Along with the complete recordings for the first two \\"Lord of the Rings\\"-movies this is the best soundtrack out there. The whole thing is utterly majestic and captures every last bit of the movie that it accompanies. From the lighter more friendly tunes to the dark and epic ones this soundtrack delivers. This is not only the musical height of the three LotR-movies, but also the height of soundtracks of all time. It will not get any better than this. Perfection is the fitting word.
B000B5XOXY|2.0|Despite the success of Batman Returns, Warner Bros. were taken back by the movie's dark, brooding tone and grim atmosphere and felt that its supposedly disappointing box-office revenues were the fault of director Tim Burton. So to pursue a more family-friendly direction, Warner Bros. ousted Tim Burton (although he still serves as a producer) and replaced him with Joel Schumacher, best known for directing The Lost Boys, Falling Down and The Client. Virtually everyone who worked for Burton like composer Danny Elfman and production designer Bo Welch was replaced: Elliot Goldenthal played the music, Barbara Ling served as production designer and prosthetic makeup artist Rick Baker also came in. Michael Keaton, who played Batman, was replaced by Val Kilmer instead. In short, Warner Bros. wanted a Batman movie that was accessible to children while at the same time entertaining to the older generation.<br /><br />So far, so good. Right? Unfortunately, I was only talking about the making of the movie. The movie itself leaves little to desire. But before we get into that, let's talk about the plot. A new villain is on the loose in Harvey Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), who is creating chaos in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne/Batman (Val Kilmer) tries to stop him but suddenly also has to face the Riddler / Edward Nigma (Jim Carrey), who is creating a device that will steal people's brainwaves and insert them into his own medulla oblongota. Thankfully, Batman adopts an orphan Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell), who discovers Wayne's secrets and decides to be his partner.<br /><br />With the talent involved, Batman Forever could have been a superlative superhero movie to surpass not only Batman Returns but also equal the first two Superman movies. Instead, for all its bright colors, neon lights and child-friendly tone, Forever is as lightweight as warped cotton candy. By substituting mindless thrills for genuine emotion, Schumacher also denies us the pain and torment that Burton showed in the first two Batman movies. We may get glimpses of Batman's past but Kilmer's Batman lacks the weight that Michael Keaton brought to the table. It also does not help that Kilmer is dull and inadequate in the role and that his romance with Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) has all the sparks of a defused bomb. It gets to the point that he is eventually forced to let the villains steal the show.<br /><br />But even the villains themselves pose a problem. Burton's villains were morally ambiguous figures whom we felt pity because of their tragic childhoods; Schumacher's villains are portrayed as simple-minded cartoon characters whose sole reason to destroy Gotham City is because they want to. Tommy Lee Jones' Harvey Two-Face in particular is a major disappointment since he could have brought a psychological complexity to the role that Aaron Eckhart did in The Dark Knight. As flawed and sloppily directed as The Dark Knight was, Eckhart's Two-Face was a wonderful creation that made us feel that character's pain. Jones' Two-Face is a campy caricature whom we feel no pity or remorse. When he is eventually killed at the end, there is no sense of pathos. Only disappointment that this character could have been better served and utilized.<br /><br />And disappointment is one that feels when watching Batman Forever. For all its flashiness and colors, the movie is an assault to the senses, from its coarse production design to its sometimes cringe-inducing one-liners (although it was nowhere near as bad as the travesty that was Batman & Robin) and its subtly bizarre homoerotic undertones (Two words: Bat Nipples). In the end, Batman Forever is exactly just that: a movie that seems to go on forever and ever.<br /><br />Batman Forever is currently available both separately and part of the Batman Anthology 1989-1997 set, which contains Burton's Batman and Batman Returns and Schumacher's tasteless Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. One does not have to guess which pair of movies is better.er.

1441866868|4.0|It is so hard to believe that Windup Girl is the author's first novel. It is one of the best author debuts I've ever read, and certainly one of the finest and to be truthful, one of the most frightening dystopian novels ever written. Since so many people have commented on the plot, I'll skip that for now, and just add my praises to those of others.     I received the unabridged book on CDs, the quality of which was excellent.  The narrator did a great job -- distinguishing between character voices very well, and pacing the telling of the story perfectly. I noticed no flaws in the recording, and at the beginning of every CD, the narration reiterated the last paragraph or so of the previous CD so that the action continued unbroken.    I can recommend both the novel itself for its most excellent story, and the book as read on CD for its fine quality.  Go get a copy NOW.
0743298039|4.0|the thirteenth tale really started a bit slow and I didn't know exactly in what direction it was taking me. After a few chapters you just let yourself get carried away by the author's pace. Great story. New characters kept popping out and the story never ended to get richer and richer.

B003HLM2QO|5.0|I play a lot of Ozzy's music in my sets and I know his music intimately. Zakk is great for what he does which is really blues influenced with tons of pentatonic licks, Gus G just took Ozzy's guitar playing to a whole new dimension. The arrangement was done prior to Gus getting the gig but he went into the studio and laid it all down again and what a great job. Ozzy's vocals sound fresh and good and looks like he's having a good time again and like he said his stuff was really beginning to sound like BLS! Very melodic with metal dripping from the tracks!
B003HLM2QO|1.0|Ozzy has been snowblinded by years of the posh life and is only relavent now to the commercialized society that like music loud with lyrical non-sence. He IS completely out of touch with true metal listeners and only his Sabbath and early solo back collections will reinforce his legacy. His current release is not Ozzy but a shell of a man he once was,due in part to age, part to self abuse, part to the good life, and part to selling out. He has more than enough to live comfortable. We support only the real Ozzy, not his lame current efforts. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM THAT IS FULL OF MEDIOCRITY,HYPE AND HAS ABSOLUTELY NO REAL SUBSTANCE!!!! LET'S FACE IT! He has been assimulated into digital mainstream music and will never be the OZZY of old again. Long live the old Ozzy. P.S. THE ONLY MERITS DESERVED ... are the younger musicians that are surrounding him now. But do stock up on his classics, which, believe me, he still gets mega-royalties from anyhow!
B003XDUCIG|5.0|To tell you the truth, I was a little hesitant about a cookbook coming from O'Reilly Media. They produce design and programming books like [[ASIN:1449381650 Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps]] and [[ASIN:0596806027 HTML5: Up and Running]], not culinary books...or so I thought...    While waiting for the book release, I checked out Jeff Potter's videos on Facebook and on the O'Reilly site. From there I was hooked. This book, just like the title says, is designed by a geek for geeks (and non-geeks). This book is all about getting hands on with your \\"software\\" and \\"hardware\\" in your \\"lab\\" :) Jeff Potter did a great job in making easy for cooks of all levels to get started. My girlfriend, who claims she's a novice, enjoyed reading cover to cover. Someday I'll read it cover to cover myself, but I'm having too much fun learning about the science of cooking a la carte.     The cool recipes I keep experimenting with are the timeless \\"shock & awe eggs\\" and the 30-Second Chocolate Cake:)  Awesome job Jeff and O'Reilly to get everyone I know reinvigorated with cooking! Highly recommended for geeks, non-geeks, foodies and novices alike!
B00383ZTXO|1.0|\\"Raw Power\\" - 2010 Legacy Edition (Bowie Mix Remastered)<br /><br />This remastered edition actually seems to have less bass and stereo dynamics than the original 1990 CD pressing from Columbia which also included the Bowie mix. All they seemed to have done here was master the album at a higher volume, then compress the frequencies and trim off lots of the low end to avoid digital distortion. While it sounds a bit cleaner, that is only because the bass rumble which gave the original 1990 pressing more power has been toned down significantly. One noticeable correction is that Iggy's burp in the beginning of \\"Raw Power\\" has been restored as it is on the original vinyl pressing. The ending of \\"Gimmie Danger\\" is also a bit longer than the original CD. Overall though, it's still just tons of mid, no high end, and now even LESS bass than before.<br /><br />I would also like to point out that the original UK LP pressings had an alternate Bowie mix of \\"Search & Destroy\\" that has yet to be released on CD. It's quite a shame they didn't use this opportunity to include it on the bonus disc.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I watched every episode of Lost. And it was one of the best TV shows I have never seen (along with Buffy and BGS). I understand a group of fans are disappointed because they did not get the answers they needed, but in my case I watched the show for different reasons: the characters. I learned to care about them, to feel what they felt, to understand them, and to live catharsis thorough their sufferings. I think the final episode was a perfect homage to these characters and it was an extremely moving television experience. And especially because, Jack, my way favorite character, was at the center of the final arc of the story. I only can say, thank you, writers, for showing respect to viewers like me, who invested emotionally in your creation. Great show (although not crazy about the whole season)... AMAZING ending!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Long after I thought I'd be tired of this CD/DVD combo, I'm still listening to it, still enjoying it and still amazed at the talent of JT, Carole, Kootch, Lee Sklar and Rusty Kunkel. At 68 years old, Carole is even more beautiful than when she brought out Tapestry. Her piano work and stage presence have grown in stature. Her voice, not as sweet, has aged very, very well.    Sweet Baby James? He sounds like he always has. Very unique, very competent, very good. Very JT. I probably wouldn't have bought the CD without Carole on it, however, their duets are unforgettable, especially \\"You Can Close Your Eyes.\\"     The DVD, amateurishly done, is a real bonus. I got so much more out of their performances when I could watch them happen.    Well worth the money.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|Gorgeous sonorities, interesting lyrics add up to a fantastic music, almost classical, and definitely exciting.

I say buy it and luxuriate in a real musical experience. Totally surprising.  Grethe Holby

So, it was a pleasure for me to send a few dollars for this excellent book.    It will not make you a repair tech. But, it will aid in the selection of your first (or 2nd or 3rd) saxophone and in a lot of basic maintenance issues.    Refreshing was Stephen's putting to rest various myths about saxophones. No, finish doesn't affect tone, etc. I'm sure he'll get wacked by some who figure they know better ... but I agree 100% with his ideas on these topics.    And if this isn't enough ... the book has a lot of very nice pictures.
B00275EHJG|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  I was looking forward to seeing Toy Story 3 since I enjoyed Toy Story 1 & 2 so much. The question remains whether Toy Story 3 measures up to its predecessors. All the main characters are back including Woody and Buzz Lightyear and the Pixar animation, with its attention to extreme detail, is even better. It was a good idea not to bring back all the toys from the previous features and dispensing with the toy soldiers (for example), by having them 'bail out', was quite clever.<br /><br />  The plot begins in the present, with the toy's owner, Andy, now about to go away to college. He packs up his toys (excluding Woody who he intends to take with him to college) and puts them in a bag, about to bring them upstairs to the attic for storage. Somehow he gets distracted and his mother mistakenly throws the bag with the toys out in the trash. The toys manage to escape from the bag but jump into a box marked for the Sunnyside Day Care Center. Woody manages to follow the toys to the day care center and insists they should all return to Andy before he goes away to college. The toys, however, don't relish the idea of being no use up in the attic and stage a mutiny. Woody leaves his colleagues, only to end up in the home of Bonnie, a young child, who has some neat, new toys including a Shakespearean hedgehog, Mr. Pricklepants, and a scatterbrained triceratops, Trixie.<br /><br />  Unlike Toy Story 1 & 2, which featured human antagonists (the vicious child 'Sid' in \\"1\\" and Al McWhiggin, the conniving toy store owner in \\"2\\"), Toy Story 3's antagonist is Lotso, a bear with a chip on his shoulder. It seems that Lotso was lost by his previous owner, a child named Daisy, who replaced him with a similar looking model. Somehow the idea that the innocent toy world can be corrupted by an evil seed within its own ranks isn't as effective as having human antagonists. That's because I think it's better to depict the toys as essentially representing the innocent and positive world of childhood with the negative force derived from the worst aspects of adulthood. In Toy Story 1, Sid is a child, obviously conditioned to be a 'monster' by his parents; and in Toy Story 2, Al the toy store owner, embodies the sin of avarice, which must be opposed through the 'goodness' of Andy's toys. In a sense, 'toydom' is diminished by pitting toy against toy and the point that adults are responsible for causing the problems of childhood, is lost.<br /><br />  The other problem I found with the plot is that Andys' toys' reaction to Lotso's directives was unfounded. You'll recall that Andys' toys claim that being placed with the 'younger children' is inappropriate; but as toys, they should expect to be thrown around by younger children (isn't that what younger children do with toys?). And was Lotso being so unfair when he demands that the new toys be placed with the younger one's first, since they're \\"first in line\\"? Notice at the end of the film, when 'fairness' is supposedly restored, Ken and Barbie are now running the day care center, now allowing all the toys to take turns, interacting with the younger and more disruptive children. Note that the toys will still be subjected to being thrown around by the younger children--simply less often.<br /><br />  Still, Toy Story 3 is filled with thrilling scenes, reminiscent of its predecessors. After Andy's toys attempt to escape from the day care center, we're taken on a wild ride inside a trash compactor. The toys face their 'dark moment of the soul' as they're about to be burnt alive in an incinerator; after Lotso fails to save them by pushing the compactor's stop button, they're miraculously saved by squeeze toy aliens who somehow manage to stop all power by operating the controls in the control room.<br /><br />  There are other neat scenes in Toy Story 3 including Buzz turning into a Lothario after accidentally being set on 'Spanish mode', Barbie and Ken falling in, then out of love and back in love again, Ken's hilarious wardrobe display and the fantastic introductory sequence featuring a wild chase involving both a train and a spaceship.<br /><br />  For those who haven't seen Toy Story 1 & 2, Toy Story 3 might seem like a masterpiece. But for those who have seen the two earlier incarnations, one can only conclude that \\"3\\" just isn't quite as good. \\"3\\" does get marks for trying however. The theme that one cannot hold on to the past is ably embodied in Woody's resistance to leaving Andy and finally accepting, along with the rest of Andy's toys, the idea that it's time to move on. On the other hand, it's sad to see Lotso, pinned to the front of a garbage truck, with the implication that he may be the victim of his new owner, who might be some kind of sadist or pervert. The image of an innocent child's toy, made to represent some demonic force, is all wrong and sadly makes Story 3 inappropriate for younger viewers., Ken's hilarious wardrobe display and the fantastic introductory sequence featuring a wild chase involving both a train and a spaceship.

0143118420|2.0|This book has absolutely nothing to do with the title.  It is actually the story of a year long vacation taken by a self absorbed rich white woman. It gives the deeply flawed impression that one can only find personal and/or spritual fulfillment by renouncing ones responsibilities and wandering the earth (funded by a 200K book deal) in search of meaning.  I stuck it out for the first two parts of the book thinking, \\"surely she will not end up the same pathetic being she started out...\\" but alas I was woefully mistaken.  It's one crutch to the next: unfulfilling marriage to extra-marital affair to rebound lover to binge eating to extreme religious practices...only to end up practically married AGAIN to a different guy less than a year after her divorce. LAME.  Be forewarned, if you aren't recently divorced, going through an acrimonious divorce, bipolar or in the midst of some sort of personal crisis you won't likely enjoy this book... if you've had any real tragedies in your life, it may well offend you.
0553582038|2.0|A friend highly recommended this series to me when I told him that I used to read sci-fi/fantasy many years ago but had not read any recently. I thoroughly enjoyed the books as I read and I began an abiding interest in the characters.  Martin's writing struck me as very developed, rich and descriptive -- so much so that I felt immersed in this new world.  I read all the books back to back and was excited to start A Feast for Crows, while being sorry that it was the last published book.    Very soon after starting it, it became apparent to me that this book was different, almost as if there were two writers or one with two different visions.  What before had been depth and richness became too much detail and tedium. What before had been descriptions of the horrors of war and conquest became scenes of incredibly detailed torture, mutilation, rape and the slaughter of innocents (SPOILER ALERT:  Throwing small boys in a bear pit and taking bets on which one the bear would eat first.  Are you kidding me?) Previous scenes of love and affection degenerated into soft porn.  I was utterly sick of reading the \\"C\\" word over and over again uttered by everyone from hardened warriors to children. Characters that before had depth were now fairly one-dimensional.    It does not take increased amounts of vulgarity, titillation and depravity to keep me interested in a book or series if the writing and story are good.  I think this story is great and I would like to see it to its end, but I am hoping that the next installment advances the story with quality writing.
B003RNXIBK|4.0|People this is a nice CD but what I hate the most is when a dope MC has a reputation to be great and they everything on the album is so hot 2 everyone!! Exampl: When Lil Wayne dropped the Carter3 eventhough it went platinum in the first week, it was not better than The Carter 2 or Carter 1! I was flipping through my TV and the Jam of the week was Eminem and Rhianna's song people I am sorry but no way is that song hot at all, it is a nice Video and Eminem sends a great message but come on people sometimes u have to just be honest with yourself and let the truth be known no matter how big of a fan you are! Eminem released a tight album though but Curren$y Pilot Talk is better in My opinion
143911000X|5.0|I have had this book for sometime and I have to say this is a very fun book to read and enjoy I love it. It is funny and not to be taken serious. Every guy will find some truth in it. My only complanit is it is just tooooo short. I wanted to read more maybe there iwll be a bro code vol 2 someday. If you like American football, Appple pie, Spike TV, and the 10 second rule I promise you you will love this book.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|Boy...I don't know where to start with this pile of useless tripe, well first off, they've made Star Trek into a FAMILY franchise with this, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying families cannot watch the older movies and series together, because they sure can, but what they've done is make it into a franchise that even non-trekkers will like, and that just doesn't work, second, they pretty much completely RE-WROTE the Star Trek universe! if you're a fan of the Original Series like me, you will see what I mean, it just doesn't add up.    And this that I am going to mention now, is just AWFUL, Spock (Vulcans cannot fall in love right?) WRONG, Spock and Uhura fall in love, and Uhura becomes Spocks little whore, this is just not the way Star Trek is, that was part of the scheme to make it a family franchise, WAKE UP J.J. Abrams, another complaint I have is the actors, now obviously the original cast is either too old now or deceased, so you can't get them for it, SO WHY EVEN TRY?! save the guy who played Spock and save the guy that played McCoy, they were pretty good, but the rest? Chris Pine is far from William Shatner, whoever played Scotty is not even close to James Doohan, whoever played Uhura? Nichelle Nichols should be disappointed.    Well, that about sums it up, bottom line, if you're a fan of The Original Series or any subsequent series (I love The Next Generation as well) steer far clear of this abomination.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Dave Lizewaski (Aaron Johnson) is your average big city teenager and comic book geek, he feels like an outcast to some of the other students. When crime has been happening thanks to gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), he orders a wet suit and decides to become a superhero named Kick-Ass. Although he has no superhero, he has metal plates in some parts of his skeleton and excellent fighting abilities with two clubs in his arms fighting whatever criminal and thug is out there. However, two of the city's well known superheroes such as Big-Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and assassin Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) begin to make a comeback since Kick-Ass has became a pop culture phenomenon as they start to kill some crooks by themselves as well as have Kick-Ass join them. The don's son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes an anti-hero himself called Red Mist to lure the heroes into a deadly trap that can cost them their lives.<br /><br />Ultraviolent, hilarious and wild action-comedy based on the cult Marvel comic from Mark Millar! this one is basically like a satire on superheroes even on the very idea that what if superheroes existed in real life. The film has been controversial due to an 11 year old girl character killing people and cussing even though the actress is really in her young teens, i think this movie is a gory and relentless action packed bath of jokes and blood with ideas of course, this movie is a winner all the way.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray includes flawless picture perfect image quality and theatrical sound to it with great extras like Ass-Kicking Bonus-View, commentary, featurettes, art gallery and marketing.

B001JAFYFG|4.0|It was refreshing to visit the World of Logan's Run.  I was amazed at the detail and imagination, that the city took on in the opening sequence.  The story gets a bit plodding at time but, the overall idea was interesting.
630587493X|5.0|When this film was released 18 days before the turn of the century it was hurt at the box office by two nearly fatal blows. The first was the temporary backlash against Robin Williams at the time for his performance in the manipulative Patch Adams. The second was the onslaught of reviews that called it \\"schmaltzy\\" and \\"overly-sentimental\\". Well, I never found it to be that way. If you want to watch a horribly manipulative and sentimental emotional rape then check-out the other Columbus/Williams movie Mrs. Doubtfire. I'd rather throw myself into the path of an oncoming combine harvester than watch that again.<br /><br />The film opens in 2005 (the \\"near future\\" at the time) as Mr. Martin (Sam Neill), a wealthy businessman has a robot servant delivered to his luxurious home. As soon as the robot is powered up he seems to be...different. His name is Andrew (which means \\"man\\" or \\"manly\\") and while his body may be robotic, his personality is not. In fact he very slowly develops and learns human characteristics as he interacts and responds to the world around him.<br /><br />Mr. Martin is astonished by Andrew's ability to understand art and music. He treats him like a member of the family and educates him by the fire every night on the customs and history of mankind. As the years pass and lives fade away Andrew sets-off on a decades-long journey to find other robots like him. The quest ends when he meets Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a robotics engineer who turns Andrew from a simple robot into a life-like android. Upon returning home with his new appearance he falls in love with his old master's great-granddaughter, who is an exact double of her grandmother. They want to be with each other so badly but know they will never be accepted by society unless Andrew can become fully human. Which is impossible.<br /><br />Or is it? It's a question for the atheists and religious zealots to fight over. At what point does Andrew develop a soul? Why is he different from other robots? Did God give him the gift of human emotion? It is a cosmic selection or is it up to the World Council to declare Andrew human? It all builds to a heartbreaking ending, that is honestly one of the toughest movie endings I have ever had to sit through. I can't even write about it so I'll end my description here.<br /><br />This is familiar territory for Williams though. His performance as Mork learning about Earth and marrying a human woman is rather close to Andrew Martin's journey to become a man. And although I wouldn't call it a kid's film, or even a comedy, there are still a lot of laughs. But not in the usual anarchic Williams style. Andrew's curiosity of the world is a much more refined and quieter performance. It's a shame that most people can't see that it's Williams inside the suit for the first hour of the film as it makes us forget he's there on the screen and perhaps appreciate his acting ability less.<br /><br />James Horner's score is also simply wonderful. It's hard to believe the man who gave us the storming action sound of Commando and Aliens could also be capable of something so warm and beautiful. I guess they didn't give him the award for Titanic for nothing. For this movie he again teamed-up with Celine Dion to record the song \\"Then You Look At Me\\", which is the perfect tune to roll the credits to. I don't care what you think about me, I love it. Even if the lyrics make that ending even more harrowing.<br /><br />Despite going as far ahead as the year 2205, there's no utopia or dystopia subtext to distract us from the story of Andrew's life. The evolution of technology and architecture is handled subtly and is unobtrusive. It's a quirky irony though, that Andrew's inventions and discoveries help save lives and forward the human race despite not being fully human himself.<br /><br />Bicentennial Man is certainly the most mature and subversive film of Chris Columbus' career as a director. As I said, not a kid's film but a masterpiece of science-fiction and character drama. How anyone could ever truly hate this film is beyond me.ction and character drama. How anyone could ever truly hate this film is beyond me.
0061714372|4.0|Just finished reading the book and I was surprised at the amount of information Dave divulged.    Although I've seen Megadeth-Behind the Music.(more than once) Those who have also seen it will enjoy reading those familair parts. But do not worry those of you...the book does offer more.  it certainly paints a vivd picture of the life,the image,the persona andthe evil.    I would have like to read more of the creative aspect to the music.  just more of the crazy stuff hes seen and experienced.  who knows maybe a second book???    After all is said and done he clarify probably the most popular questions people always seem to ask/wonder about including metallica and his time with his family, friends, bandmates etc.    The end does leave you curious and craving a new must have Megadeth CD!
B00178JDCK|5.0|I was so surprised to find that this pedal is great. The reverb effects are great. Doesn't work great with distortion if you have alot of reverb, but it still sounds good with it toned down. The 'space' setting on this pedal was worth the 50 bucks by itself. Nuff said.

B00006AW2M|5.0|1967 was the year when psychedelia was at its zenith and several bands released albums bearing its influence. The Rolling Stones came up with Their Satanic Majesties Request which was then and has been misguidedly considered a counterpart to The Beatles' Sgt. Peppers. This is wholly untrue in my opinion and the album doesn't sound anything like the one released by the fab four. It is much more in the vein of, say, Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn which was also released that year.     As for the music, it bears a dense, textured dark vibe throughout full of exotic sounds and great songs. 2000 Man, She's A Rainbow and 2000 Light Years From Home are all top shelf while Sing This All Together, Citadel and Bill Wyman's In Another Land are definitely inspired. The album though is meant to be enjoyed as a whole as one would with a concept one. The Stones never again would sound like that, and this is one of the reasons why it should be highly regarded by anybody with an open mind. This is actually a treat and arguably the pinnacle of Stones Phase One.    One shouldn't fall into the trap of comparing it too much with anything else as this ultimately owes to the sound of 1967 as a whole lot of other albums do. Just before I go, I totally recommend this latest remastered edition which finally does its grandeur justice. Free your mind from all preconceptions and approach it with joy for this is the Stones entering their prime.
0307454541|3.0|So like many people, I'd heard a lot of praise about this book. After finally pushing myself to read the last 250 pages in one night, I have to say I have mixed feelings. Despite creating one of the most complex characters in Lisbeth that I've read in some time, I felt that this book really needed a good editor to trim it down both in prose and in plot. I'm all for complicated plots and having many plot twists, but there were too many Vangers to keep up with that ultimately had nothing to do with the main plot. Then when you think it ends, there's another 100 pages to go with the journalist trying to clear his name which frankly felt like it was tacked on for no good reason. The final image/ending is rather abrupt and doesn't sum up or do anything to bring any sense of closure to the story.<br /><br />I can only recommend this book again for the character of Lisbeth but I can't see myself reading the others in the series.
0316069906|5.0|Highly recommend this book - a must-read for everyone who wants to be informed about what is happening in the factory farming industry.

B003KUSUG8|3.0|I bought this cd just after I heard the second release ( Love the way u lie)- duet with Rihanna. I am not an eminem \\"fan\\" per say but his performance at the 2010 BET awards was really moving. With that being said I am not a rap fan either but have found a good few songs I can Jam to. I only gave it 3 stars cause I prefer music with out profanity.....but as my brother says you can't buy eminem and not expect that. Over all the songs were cool and now since I have listened to the cd a few times I am not as astonished .
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I had anticipated this album for well over a year, at first not having any idea what to expect.  Then in late December 2009, A7X drummer Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan died.  It didn't take long before people began hearing exactly what they were going to get from this album.    First, let me start by saying that if you think you're going to sit down and listen to this album and understand everything about it the first time you hear it, don't even bother.  As with every new A7X song, the first time I heard \\"Nightmare\\" when it was released as a digital single back in May, I really didn't fully understand it.  Then, after hearing it a few more times, I began to grasp and appreciate all that was going on with it.  That is exactly how the rest of the album is, and that's what I like so much about Avenged Sevenfold.     \\"Nightmare\\" is an album that is full of twists and turns, and in my opinion, pure genius.  From the tear-jerking ballads such as \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Victim\\", to the face-stomping headbangers such as \\"God Hates Us\\" and \\"Welcome To The Family\\", this album aims to please anyone who can truly appreciate great musical talent.

0393312836|5.0|Written during the height of the Cold War in 1962 this famous Burgess novel looks towards an England dominated by the Soviet Union. The grim Soviet England of the twenty first century is ruled by a puppet Labor Party bent on restoring order at any price. The price is the adoption of compulsory brain surgery to control rampaging, restive youth crazies who threaten the stability of the state.<br /><br />State-provided hallucinogenic milk apparently does not pacify the youth gangs that plague London. Alex and his \\"droogs\\" become the unwilling experiments in the state's surgical pacification scheme. CLOCKWORK raises the question of whether free will or state madated determinism rules the human soul in a dramatic showdown between priest and commissar. As in WANTING SEED, medicine becomes the grim handmaiden for the state and a constant nemesis for the prolife Burgess.<br /><br />This book works well as linguistic fiction with the future culture of England defined by the newspeak of Russian/cockney slang. We visit CLOCKWORK'S crumbling, socialist England as witnesses to its unique newspeak language defined in a glossary at the end of the book. The slang puts us in scene. CLOCKWORK is classic dystopia and succeeds where its sister dystopia WANTING SEED, also written in 1962, fails.<br /><br />The american book edition drops the last chapter as does the movie, but it is here for you to read. The reflective Alex decides to grow up and apparently look for a wife to propagate his kind as society has been supressed. As in ONE HAND CLAPPING we are left in a moral desert created by the working class and the mass culture that allows them to flourish. The elitist Burgess would have nothing less.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393315088 The Wanting Seed (Norton Paperback Fiction)]]

B000YI7MRM|5.0|A must see for Viggo fans. He does an excellent job as the intrepid Capitan Alatriste, brave, tough, cynical, romantic and true.
B002ZG9788|4.0|3.8 stars<br /><br />Yes, this one is all about the CGI, and that's what I liked about it. There was little pretense of creating a dramatic masterpiece, and much focus on action and thrills, both of which were delivered well, aided by an excellent score. The film starts somewhat slowly but soon ramps up and moves along nicely, and as a simple piece of entertainment I enjoyed it.<br /><br />COTT doesn't hew very closely to the real Greek myths, but so what. Neither did the original, and I found this version much less hokey and much more enjoyable. Fiennes and Neeson add some dramatic weight to the proceedings (if not overly much), and Worthington contributes his two sides: dogged determination beset by underlying fear and uncertainty, and the curious puppy on the way to doggedness. Which is perfect, as we wouldn't want too much real acting to remind us how ridiculous this whole exercise is.<br /><br />The effects are exemplary, which is the key to all the fun, and the sound effects and Djawadi's crackling score complete the visceral thrills. There are some fine action scenes, especially in Medusa's cave and the final Kraken battle, and the almost flawless blu-ray transfer does them justice. This was just plain fun to watch on a good set-up; crank the volume on your surround sound and prepare to be floored by good old goofy b-movie intensity. With an a-movie budget.<br /><br />I didn't expect much coming in and got more than I'd hoped for, and I might even watch this again some day.
B0015FHDRW|3.0|Interesting cd.  After the first song it's pretty easy to tell it's Green Day, but it's not quite as edgy.  Has some good songs, but there's a couple that sound like early 60's Hugo Montenegro.  It will get some play time with me, but if I had just heard it not knowing it was Green Day I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B001JDS7CU|5.0|I bought this as my first Blu-ray for my new HDTV. I waited for years until I could watch this series in full HD. Once I started watching, I couldn't stop. I learned amazing things about our planet and was blown away by the video that was captured. This is a must have for those with a Blu-Ray player...something I'll keep and share for a long time. Oh, and you can't beat the price and service you'll receive from Amazon!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It's no surprise that Avatar is the highest grossing film of all time. It looks amazing, raised the bar in visual effects, and was well written and acted too. I doubt there are many people who haven't seen the movie yet, but if you are one of the few who haven't, see it asap!
B00005N6KG|2.0|I got this for gym use. The cable is shorted than what it should be for normal elliptical/treadmill use. Now one side stopped working. When the cable is held is one particular position, the sounds comes back indicating it's a contact issue where the cable joins the ear piece. This ear phone is comfortable but I do not recommend it.

The overall story would have been better if the romance was built up or if I was more invested in the characters. I do say it started out so good though.
0060899220|5.0|Being a self confessed chef junkie (stating that up front) I found this book to be one of the best reads ever.  Aside from the wild and woolly antics of chefs, sous chefs, bakers, managers, owners et al, there is some very serious commentary here on the \\"power\\" of food and the restaurant business.  This highly entertaining book will make you laugh out loud, and also do some thinking.  I recommend this book without any reservations (no joke intended). It is one of those that you don't put down until you are done and then you are sorry that it's over.  Needless to say I am getting his new book.
0596007124|3.0|Just tries too damn hard to be funny and cute.  If that's what you want in a technicnal book (and apparently lots of people do), then this might work for you.  Also, for all it's apparent effort to lead you by the nose through the various exercises, it has a habit of suddenly leaving you hanging.  You're following along and coding the exercises like a good little reader, thinking your keeping up and everything's just swell, and then you find out when you execute the driver class that there are another dozen or more classes you have to code that were never mentioned in the text.  They just showed up as errors when you tried to run - the chapters on the Facade and Command patterns leap readily to mind, but there were others.  That's when you go to their website, download their code, and find out you've been coding interfaces and method signatures that won't work with their code.<br /><br />The other area where the book falters is in the intermediate exercises.  The code that you download from their website only reflects the final result of each chapter.  If you have trouble with something in the middle and need code to look at for one of those exercises, your out of luck.<br /><br />The book's not a complete waste, but it is far more frustrating than all the positive reviews here would lead you to believe.

0307278255|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri's Unaccustomed Earth is a collection of short stories that is written about Bengali Indian immigrants but speaks to everyone.  If you want to read some short stories about the tragedies and joys, the shortcomings and strengths of the human spirit, check this book out.  Even though it's about a certain slice of the population, I think everyone can find something in this book to which they can relate.     Lahiri has an interesting story-telling style that is comprised of a disproportionate amount of narrative to dialogue.  She spends her time telling her readers what the characters are doing and thinking and feeling, relieving her characters of the majority of that responsibility.  In Lahiri's case, however, she has her craft down to such an art that we look forward to the narrative, to the long paragraphs and her authoritative disclosure of her characters' state of mind.  Every word is measured and weighed, included only because it's absolutely necessary.  And yet, despite this sense of being careful, there is a richness to Lahiri's work that makes one think of enjoying a really good meal at an expensive restaurant that is worth every penny.     Of the first five stories in Unaccustomed Earth, the most striking is \\"Only Goodness\\" about a sister-brother pair who deal with the issue of alcoholism in a heartbreaking way.  Lahiri writes intimately about the addiction, and the final pages of the story make the reader shake his or her head in disbelief all the while wanting to know what might happen next.  As is the nature of the genre, however, we don't get to know any more about the characters than what Lahiri chooses to reveal.  And like the hallmark of any good book, we are left wanting to know more.     The section entitled \\"Hema and Kaushik\\" includes the trio of stories at the end of the book, going into the details of the title characters and their experiences in growing up as second-generation Bengalis and first-generation Americans.  Their lives converge at one point, deviate from each other, and then intersect once again.  Their end is happy and then again isn't; they find pieces of themselves in one another in that all-encompassing experience of being the children of immigrants.  Yet despite that common experience, they suffer from the same shortcomings that all humans do and those shortcomings prevent them from finding the happiness for which they'd both hoped.            Because of my own cultural heritage I don't have an outsider's view of Lahiri's works (and because of my kinship with them I'm partial to anything she writes,) but I have no doubt that to a certain extent anyone could find elements of their own lives in these stories.  In tackling the immigrant experience, Lahiri has managed to spotlight the human experience.  For that very reason--and also to marvel at the beauty of her prose--Unaccustomed Earth is a must read for anyone.
006621131X|4.0|I liked this book.  Pattie Smith tells her story in an engaging and unassuming way.  There are no traumatic ups-and-downs - even though there are plenty of ups and downs.  She somehow folds these into her story as though they represent the normal progress through life - and so they do.  Hers is a quite telling of a tale.  She moves, takes trips, changes jobs,  and always - always - seeking artistic expression through poetry, music drawing, and involving herself in Robert Mapplethorpe's career as an artist and a photographer.  Mapplethorpe is her soul-mate.  Much of her life in New York is defined by her relationship with Robert.  Her writing is skillful.  Smith successfully captures the New York world of striving (and often starving) artists in the 70's.  She drops a lot of names of people she has associated with over the years (Alan Ginsberg, the playwright Sam Shepard, Salvidore Dali) - but you never get the impression that she is \\"name-dropping.\\"   These personalities just seemed to \\"show up\\" in her life.  She is admirable in her devotion to friends and in her uncompromising pursuit of art (something she acquires through Robert).  She never seems caught up with the type of angst about life choices that most of us have - if she has regrets about anything, she does not reveal them.     In a way, she lets you glimpse her life, but she does not let you in.  The main focus is on her early career and relationship with Robert.  Later in the book we learn that she eventually marries and has two children, but we learn little about them. If you are looking for deep introspection or philosophical musings you may be disappointed, but I liked the way she skims the surface. She is a poet, rather than a novelist and the images and short passages she offers go a long way. We glimpse bits and pieces of her life like someone gazing through a window without ever really knowing what animates the people inside.  I think this is part of the appeal, particularly for anyone who also haspersonal memories from the 70's.  We connect with her story in part because it causes us to remember our own youthful struggles.
0896898288|5.0|When I saw this book, I had to make the quilt so I bought the book.  This book is thoroughly enjoyable to read.  I read the letters as I make the corresponding quilt blocks.<br /><br />This book is NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  The author assumes the people making the quilt are experienced quilters and that they know how to use templates and how to use a computer to open and print pdf files in order to make the fabric cutting templates.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Well if you're an avid science fiction reader like myself - you should probably pick up this book.     It's very classic sci-fi in the sense of containing in-space battles, technology, and the future. A very satisfying read. I do find that it was very basic in its composure so I can imagine it may trigger a few reviews that feel the book was lacking - especially if these reviews were written by people who don't typically read sci-fi. It is also a tad isolationist - but I think it was meant to be. It was comforting - I certainly have felt like Ender several times in my past.     I wanted to give the book five stars but I settled with four because of its lack of descriptive writing. There's certainly nothing wrong with this writing style - I just personally wanted something a little bit more. I love the power of beautiful language and I think it was what this story was \\"missing\\" for me. I had a really hard time picturing the characters, especially the adults because of this. I also had an extraordinarily hard time imagining the battle scenes in battle school due to lack of description. However, it was still a good reading experience for me considering it gave me the opportunity to form the world as I believed it to be in my own head.     Other than that though, the book was amazing. Great story, great characters and a great plot. Some of Ender's time in battle school is a little blurred together for me - especially the games themselves, but I don't think that takes away from the story at all. It certainly had everything that I look for in a sci-fi novel. I'm definitely going to at least read the sample of the sequel and see if I'm interested in continuing the series. A friend of mine said that the next installments in the series weren't really worth reading - but I'd like to decide for myself anyhow. Hopefully the kindle sample of the sequel will include some of the actual story this time - unlike this book. This was probably the biggest problem that I had with this book - I had to buy it blind. Talk about not being kindle-friendly!    Anyhow, bottom line - if you read sci-fi, definitely pick it up. If not, you may or may not be disappointed. It just depends on your reading style.

B002ZG994U|5.0|My prereview:<br /><br />\\"In 2010, a group of Hollywood filmmakers desperately sought a Summer blockbuster. These men promptly returned to the archives and revamped a classic 80s TV show. Today, still living off of good marketing and nostalgia for good television, they survive as Hollywood elites. If you have (script) problems, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...WRITERS!\\" Dah dah-Dah, dah-Dah dah...<br /><br />My review:<br /><br />Was I ever wrong! Succled at the disappointments of such remakes as \\"SWAT,\\" \\"Shaft,\\" \\"Starsky & Hutch,\\" etc., I expected the worst (\\"I pity the fool who replaces Mr. T. as B.A.!\\") I was expecting such a terrible movie that I went with fingers crossed that I would be proven wrong and walked out of the theater at the end impressed! Mind you, Rampage is no Mr. T. but he played the role well as well as the actor who played \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Murdock. Oh, yeah; and Jessica Biel was the lead actress. Was it campy and cheesy? Let's just say that they \\"fly\\" a tank in one scene; but come on, they were remaking the A-TEAM! It had to be at least a little bit cheesy in order to pay homage to such a classic show.<br /><br />So, in short, the Hollywood elites got the Summer blockbuster that they had asked for and I was actually very impressed with the results. I can hear the film execs now: \\"I love it when a plan comes together!\\"
1934429376|5.0|I love this book, it's very inspiring just by flipping through the pages. a great reference book for illustrations as well.
0345457692|5.0|this is a must read for any fan of the sci fi genre. He creates a daft and elborate world for Tak to explore through.
0439023483|5.0|This book was so amazing. I've never been invested in the characters and hooked on a book within the first 10pages. I loved the futuristic aspect but yet feeling like Panem is medevil as well. The characters were vivid so well developed I really felt connected to each and everyone of them. Don't miss this book it's a re-reader forsure in fact I felt like starting over the minute I got to the last page but I needed to start Catching Fire so I didn't! I'm sure I will when I get done with Mocking Jay so excited for the rest of the series.

B000VPPMXO|5.0|I ordered two 500 Series Virtual Wall Lighthouses through Amazon, and found they do not work with the new model #536.  The Amazon ad states (in the Product Description) that the lighthouses work with models 535 and up.  According to IRobot product support, this was true at one time, but not with the new 536 (and possibly other new models).  The 536 will only work with Virtual Walls.    FYI, I could not rate the lighthouse, so my rating is for the 536.
B0009MDPYW|5.0|It's a good movie, great effects, the characters all seem real, there is drama, action and some funny parts. MINOR SPOILERS: You get the usual complaints in other reviews: \\"i dont understand why the spear was in a nazi flag\\"... anyone who has heard of occult artifacts has heard that hitler was supposed to have been looking for the spear. yes they could have spelled out every occult reference and made the movie an hour longer or you can just enjoy it. \\"why did the cop's sister know constantine's name?\\" she's psychic for one, they met in hell and half of hell knows him not to mentioned that her sister who she is linked to becomes his companion! if i have to explain why angels can fly when their body weight would be too heavy for their wings i'm gonna puke. You aren't supposed to dissect it. It's a movie not a documentary.

044024367X|5.0|I read this book precisely BECAUSE everyone was not liking it!  I don't see it as liberal at all. Rather Reacher has always mused as he did things, so this book just has more musing than most. I have heard former soldiers report finding out things they did not expect were going on, and they definitely wondered why they were seeing corruption and theft. I am conservative, but I definitely think more warfare and problems with hazardous substances goes on than we know about. This book has Jack wondering the same things.  And the evangelical sect that wants to \\"hurry along\\" the end times happening: they exist also and it is a mistake to believe they would not do what is done in this book.  It was not as fast paced as all the others. He goes back to Despair so many times that you feel your head spinning. But I enjoyed it as a slower book and got to see more of the character Reacher.   I felt how he and she handled the injured husband was touchingly thoughtful, not  negative whatsoever. It is NOT good to spoil the story for others. I am glad I did not read that review before purchase. I do not know if medically everything was depicted correctly, but the caring and realism were definitely on point. I still recommend this book.

0143118420|4.0|Just days before the Julia Roberts version comes out in theaters nationwide, I finally got around to reading this memoir. I began reading it halfway expecting not to like it (as a few other readers I know didn't care for it), and ended up being pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I do understand why people might not enjoy it though--the book can seem a little self-indulgent and maybe even a tad preachy at times. But for me, Gilbert's easy writing style invited me right in, and through most of the book, I felt more like I was chatting with a dear friend, rather than reading the inner musings of a total stranger. As a travel lover myself, I was thrilled to 'tag along' with Gilbert on her year-long journey to far-away lands (and as a true foodie, I was in heaven during the Italy portion of the memoir...loved sampling the local cuisine vicariously through those pages!). Overall, this was an enjoyable and escapist book that I'm glad I read. I would recommend it to people who are 'armchair travelers' and who like the idea of taking a journey in order to find yourself and find balance in your life. If you don't like the idea of that kind of a journey, then this may not be the book for you.
030745455X|5.0|There is a reason this is a best seller! Best book I have reqad in years. Good character development, gripping story, multiple plots that intertwine well. The author's liberal propensity is weaved in well. I am recommending to all my friends. See the Swedish movie of the book after you read the book. It is well done and although they changed some details of the plot they remained true to the notions presented in the book.
0312370849|5.0|This book is fantastic! Ones of those, \\"can't put down the book\\" type of books. It centers around a horrific event, so there were many time I had to set the book down to wipe the tears from my eyes. I read, \\"Those who saved us\\" by Jenna blum right after this----I kinda got the bug to read books about this era. Both books were so good.
0316044938|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a novel that will keep you interested until the very end. It is beautifully written, has amazing imagery, and is intensely emotional with beautiful allegorical references. It will affect you on a deep level. The book is written from Suzie's perspective, even after she dies and arrives in what I believe is Purgatory. She has been raped and murdered and feels enormous pain in the afterlife. We feel the intense pain she feels as she watches her family deteriorate after her demise. Because of Susie's violent and abrupt departure, she isn't dealing with her death well and can't break the binds to Earth and the people she cares for. We follow her agonizing journey as she slowly accepts her own death and says goodbye to the people she loves.<br /><br />There are some really important themes in this novel. The most important being Grief and Loss. Everyone grieves differently and moves through the stages of grief at different times and stages. This is very apparent in this novel, as the family members do not move through the cycle at the same time, and it greatly affects the cohesion of the unit. Acceptance is another theme. It is not easy for people to accept a loved one's death, maybe even more so when that person was taken in a brutal, violent way. In order to move on from the grieving process, they have to accept that Susie is no longer with them. And, Susie has to move on and accept her own death. This allows her to move on to Heaven.<br /><br />Conclusion: 5 stars! This book is phenomenal. It is a heavy read and will evoke emotion in you. It is not a mystery, as Susie tells you the who/what/why/when/how immediately. Instead, it is a character-driven piece that travels through the human psyche and delivers raw emotion on an epic scale.<br /><br />The movie was released this year and is now on DVD. While it did not convey the emotional intensity that the book portrays, I thought it was a beautiful and chilling movie.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|Long story short for me: the series featuring the 9th & 10th Doctors delivered real excitement that Series 5 sorely lacks.    With Eccleston and Tennant I almost had the sense the Doctor was so real, I might actually find the Tardis parked 'round the corner one day. In those series, I really enjoyed the diversity of the casting for every episode; the incredible music scoring of each episode; how the characters endured modern struggles - such as Donna being frustrated that she was stuck working as a temp - all those things contributed to a sense of *relatability* to the characters. Moffat's Doctor Who seems to be created inside a much more sterile, narrowly-defined world.    On to Matt Smith - he's very good, but would it be too much to ask that the 11th Doctor display even just a smidge of sex appeal! :) Companion Amy Pond - 100% annoying. (I know, I know - heresy.)    Writing and direction for the fifth series: was rarely on the edge of my seat. The worst episodes of the RTD era were more compelling than what was offered up as the best of this series.    No doubt, though, this dvd collection of series 5 will deliver the goods for Doctor Who fans. I *was* one - but after series 5, not so very much any more. Although does one ever really \\"leave\\" the Doctor? :)
0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere is my favorite book! It's a dark, gothic urban fantasy that takes place in London Underground. While the characters are eccentric and unique, you will find no vampires, weres or faeries in this novel. Instead, Gaiman's fantastical world is a reflection of reality - an alternate reality.<br /><br />Richard is a young businessman leading a normal existence. On his way to dinner with his fianc&eacute; one evening, he stops to rescue a young women who is lying on the sidewalk, bleeding. He takes the girl named Door back to his apartment. The next day, she has fully recovered and asks him to find someone name the Marquis de Carabas. She needs this person to aid her in escaping some of the most evil, vile characters I've ever encountered in fiction - Croup and Vandemar. Once Richard returns to his apartment with the Marquis, the Marquis and Door both vanish immediately.<br /><br />Richard soon learns that his interactions with these strange people have literally turned him invisible to the world. He loses his job, his apartment, no one recognizes him anymore. He has now become a part of London Below. People who \\"slip through the cracks\\" takes on an entirely new meaning in this novel.<br /><br />Richard sets out to find Door in London Below so he can get his life back. Along the way, he meets Rat Speakers, crosses a dark and mysterious underground bridge that has the tendency to gobble people up as they cross, and finds a Floating Market under Harrods, of all places. He discovers that Lady Door is someone of nobility in this underworld, and she is on a mission to discover the people behind her family's demise. At this point, Richard has no other option but to join her in the quest to bring down the malevolence that is out to destroy this world.<br /><br />The series of events in this book are intense, grim and treacherous. Richard is quite unremarkable and about as normal as one can be, but he grows on you. His desire to get back to his normal existence in London Above is his main motivation to continue on this insane ride, but the more involved he comes with London Below, the more his chances to leave it diminish. Door is a fantastic character who is way more than she seems.<br /><br />The descriptions of these areas and people are very visual and detailed. Gaiman's writing is engaging, simplistic and full of wonderful expression. He has a sense of humor when breathing life into his characters. For example, Croup and Vandemar are like Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but cruel and inhumane. They are vile and enjoy bringing pain and death, yet they speak as though they have been raised by the Queen herself. They are extremely eloquent, which is in contrast to their despicable personalities. It's odd and funny. Also, the entire cast of eccentric and odd-ball characters are accepted for who they are in London Below. They can be themselves without being shunned by society. It kinda makes you wonder which reality is better...<br /><br />When I recently visited London for the first time, it was so great to see all the landmarks talked about in this book. The names of tube stations were especially fun for me because of their use in the book. The Earl of Earl's Court is quite a character in the book, and runs his court on an abandoned Tube train that has its own schedule and route. I wanted to take a picture in front of the Earl's Court Tube sign, but it never happened. That scene is one of my favorites.  The Black Friar monks are housed in Blackfriars and Islington is an Angel, an important character in the story.<br /><br />Neverwhere was actually an urban fantasy TV mini-series in the mid 1990s that aired on BBC. I've watched some of the series through Netflix and it so hokey and ridiculous! But, Gaiman decided to put the TV series into book form, and it is gloriously awesome. It's very much an Alice in Wonderland-esque story, which is probably why I was drawn to it. Alice is my favorite Children's book! In short, Gaiman is a wonderful storyteller, and this story is sure to keep your interest until the very end. This book receives every star I own.st until the very end. This book receives every star I own.

0439023483|5.0|Meet Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year-old female who lives with her younger sister, Prim, and their mother. Katniss has had an unfortunately difficult life but she has made the best of it. She lives in District 12, the final district of Panem. It is the Coal producing district, and she lost her father, a coal miner, in a mine disaster, years earlier. Panem arose out of what remained of North America after natural and man-made disasters destroyed it. As with many post-apocalyptic tales, rebellions occurred against the powers-that-be, otherwise known as the Capitol. During the uprisings, District 12 was defeated and District 13 was destroyed.<br /><br />In order for the 12 districts to always remember who holds the power, the Capitol began an annual event called The Hunger Games. Every year, each district produces one girl and one boy (ages 12 through 18, randomly drawn) to fight in the Games. The 24 tributes are taken to the Capitol and enjoy a short week of simple training, eating like kings, and attending events and interviews. Then, they are thrown into the vast outdoor arena to fight for their lives, as the Hunger Games has only one winner.<br /><br />As you can probably guess, Katniss is the tribute for District 12, along with Peeta Mellark, the town baker's son. They are whisked away to the Capitol and treated like royalty. It becomes apparent that Katniss may stand a chance in the Games when she proves to the Gamemasters that she possesses great hunting skills. After all, she has been keeping her family from starvation for years by killing game and gathering vegetation (illegally) in the Seam of District 12.<br /><br />While Katniss and Peeta are from the same District, it is no secret that they will eventually face one another as enemies. Peeta is very kind, but Katniss vows not to allow him to weasel his way into her heart. Peeta surprises her though, on many levels and in many ways, throughout the book. Does he eventually weasel his way in? Can he be trusted in such a dire situation?<br /><br />The characters in this novel are very realistic as they sympathize with others and form alliances and friendships even though they face overwhelming odds. All 24 tributes have some sort of page time, some way more than others. The plot is high intensity, very dramatic, deeply emotional and completely engrossing! Katniss is courageous, intelligent, skilled, wily, and compassionate. Peeta is kind, loyal, and brave, but is not on an equal playing field with Katniss' skills. Peeta grew on me. I didn't have much draw towards him through much of the book, but he won me over at the #7 quote below.<br /><br />The mutations of animals that you come across in this world are interesting, freaky and vile! The Capitol bio-engineered certain species for their own purposes - spying, physical damage, etc - and they play serious roles in this story. The mutants at the end of the book completely horrified me and I wonder if we will learn more about them.<br /><br />There are a few twists at certain times in the books. One is very obvious, in my opinion, but the one at the end snuck up on me! It is an ugly twist that will make you gasp, and the outcome of that event sends us flying into the second book, Catching Fire.<br /><br />Conclusion: 5 WHOLE STARS! What an entertaining and simultaneously disturbing novel! While the plot has been done before (The Game, Battle Royale), it does not take away from the emotional intensity you will find yourself feeling page after page! It is nothing short of fantastic. I have yet to speak to a book blogger who did not rave about this trilogyThe characters in this novel are very realistic as they sympathize with others and form alliances and friendships even though they face overwhelming odds. All 24 tributes have some sort of page time, some way more than others. The plot is high intensity, very dramatic, deeply emotional and completely engrossing!

While the plot has been done before (The Game, Battle Royale), it does not take away from the emotional intensity you will find yourself feeling page after page! It is nothing short of fantastic. I have yet to speak to a book blogger who did not rave about this trilogy
1595825045|5.0|Perfect for any fan of the show. Besides featuring lots of amazing art from the series, there are a lot of facts and background info on the production of the show. One of the best art books I've ever seen.
B000002URV|3.0|This Enigma CD I could do without. A few of the songs are good...but alot of the CD is kind of annoying.
030745455X|2.0|Wow...what a snooze.  I had to work hard to get through this.  The first book, ...\\"Dragon Tattoo\\" was 100% better than this book.  I was really disappointed.  No plot and too much irrelevant information.
B001MVYUPC|4.0|Great movie and great reproduction.    Enjoyed every minute.    Ben Kingsley IS Gandhi.
0446679089|5.0|This guy is a master story teller.  I love his John Corey character. Great sense of humor too!  I love the fact that this character is such a horn dog, loves women but there is no raunchiness.
B002VWONB2|4.0|Great movie!    As a B/W film, I don't know if Blu-Ray enhanced it much.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Gee, I am really surprised the US Government didn't stop this movie from being released.  The REAL story finally comes out.  This is exactly what happened with the Bush Administration's ghost WMDs.
0307454541|4.0|Like many other reviewers, I wasnt at all interested in the first part of this book. The background of the Wennerstrom affair went completely over my head - partly I was bored, partly I was uninterested, and partly I jsut didnt get. I dont know if I spaced out a bit, but I still dont fully understand what Mikhael's crime was.<br /><br />The story did pick up though and I was really interested in the mystery of Harriet Vangar. Here are my con's:<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert)<br /><br />- How many times can the 2 main characters drink coffee?<br />- Why was Mikhael portrayed as a sex craved maniac? Cecelia Vangar got him undressed in 3 seconds and it only took Lisbeth a half of a second to argue him right into bed.<br />- There were too many vangar family members to keep track off.<br />- After Lisbeth's revenge attack on her guardian, the incident is never brought up again!<br />- It may just be me, but I'm still confused as to what Mikhael's crime was, and what exactly Lisbeth did with the money in the Swedish banks at the end of the book.<br /><br />Other than these minor points, I was really into the book and the mystery and couldnt put it down. Its true there was some violent/sex/rape that had me a bit squeemish, but all in all I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I'm curious how the 2nd book fits in and where it picks up.
0061714372|5.0|Not bad, but as others have mentioned, if you are a Megadeth fan, the majority of the stories won't be new. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed and devoured this book in a sitting. It brought back some memories (particularly seeing Megadeth at what is no longer the Palladium in NYC during their heyday). In a weird way it's good to see that Mustaine is still his old snarky self despite all the epiphanies and crazy life he's had. Would've liked a bit more fleshing out of metal's early SF/Bay Area origins/happenings but all in all, a damn good read and nice to see that Dave has seemingly found a bit more piece of mind in recent years.    P.S. -Mustaine hates LA glam rock, but if you want a good companion to this book to fill out more of the west coast metal eighties, check out \\"The Dirt\\", Motley Crüe's biography.    Cheers    AK
B00006AVRK|5.0|Loved the series, I think it should have continued.  The quality of the product was new and arrived in a timely manner.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This movie is great, I enjoy watching it alot, Mara Wilson is a smart kid in this movie, I love the very end of the movie where Miss honey adopts Matilda, I wonder if there's a second part to this great movie, It would be great to see how Miss Honey and Matilda lived together and if Miss honey ever got married, I guess we will never get to see that happen.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I've only gotten through the first 3 DVD's of the set, but from what I've seen so far, this is an excellent documentary. It's ironic that the economic conditions that led to Hitler's rise to power mirror those here in the U.S. The fact that so many are willing to give up their civil rights to stave off perceived fears....but back to the DVD. Here in the USA we only know about several events of WWII, (Pearl Harbor, Normandy assault, Iwo Jima, and Hiroshima)but there were so many lives lost before we even entered the war. This set is not some romanticized version of the war, which we are so use to seeing. It is war as the way it should be seen. As I stated earlier, I have not watched all 13 DVD's yet but it is ironic to hear Anglos voice their opposition to being enslaved, yet most of the participants of the war had colonized other non-whites. If you are a war history buff or ex-military such as myself, this is a very well put together set.
157421327X|5.0|If you haven't tried Zentangles, then your doodles just don't have the impact that this book will give you.

B003EYVXSW|4.0|The best horror films don't merely provide lots of gore and bloodletting, but tap into the primal fears of human beings, as well as the darkest parts of human nature. \\"Splice\\" does just that.<br /><br />Audience reactions seem to be mixed to \\"Splice\\", and it's easy to see why. \\"Splice\\" is really more of an art film that has more in common with David Cronenberg's films than mainstream horror fare like the \\"Saw\\" franchise. The film even stars Sarah Polley, an indie film fixture.<br /><br />Polley plays Elsa, who, along with her husband and fellow geneticist Clive (Adrian Brody), create a human/animal hybrid in secret, who they later name Dren (\\"nerd\\" spelled backwards, a cute way of the two embracing their science geek status). As in all horror films, playing with mother nature turns out to have disastrious consequences.<br /><br />Although films have long been using this basic plot that goes all the way back to \\"Frankenstein,\\" what elevates \\"Splice\\" is its great script and acting. Elsa and Clive's relationship, which is both collaborative and competitive, facilitates the whole nightmare, as well as Elsa's tragic backstory as an abused, rural kid.<br /><br />What steals the show, however, is Dren. The film manages to make the creature both childlike, animalistic, and freakishly sexual, which is not only disarming for the audience, but leads to the disturbing plot developments in the film's controversial last act.
0061120081|5.0|I read this book many years ago and of course watched the movie. I bought it this time for my grandchildren to read and hope they will enjoy it. It is not a great novel in any artistic sense of the word, but it is a great book.
B003J27WFW|5.0|If you know everything about RUSH, then you've already seen this.  If you think you know everything about RUSH and haven't seen this, then you're wrong.  If you are mildly interested in RUSH and kind of like some of their music, then after seeing this, you will appreciate them much much more.  If you hate RUSH, you'll probably still hate RUSH after watching this, but it's very interesting none the less.
B00004YA66|4.0|Neither John or his father Frank can believe it at first when they are communicating over ham radio. It is 1999, and Frank died fighting a fire in 1969.<br /><br />But we believe it. The charm of Frequency is that the relationship between the two (Frank is Dennis Quaid and John Jim Cazaviel) is so strong, the time travel seems almost plausible. As soon as they establish that they are indeed in touch--they use plays of the Mets '69 World Series to verify- both take advantage: first to save the father from the fire, and his Camel Cigarettes, to catch a killer.<br /><br />I won't reveal much more plot, but the 1969 scenes have amazingly real detail, and the father son friendship is genuinely touching to watch.<br /><br />This is an example of how science fiction should be done.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|I received the dvd in the condition just like the seller had described.Also,the shipping was fast.I ordered the dvd one day and three days later WHAM I got it.I would buy from this seller again.
B003FVOAHA|5.0|I read one of the earlier editions as a young man and it inspired me to live a positive and confident life. It was easy to read and I never forgot the lessons it taught.  I highly recommend it! CT
0143038419|5.0|I wanted to read this book before the movie came up. The book I purchase was used but in great condition.  This story is like reading someones diary, I enjoyed mostly her thoughts about life and the feelings she had and how she tries to deal with them. On her journey she keeps on expresing her thought wich I liked a lot and you see how she starts feeling peace step by step. For me Bali was entertaining and fresh. Love the book just hope the movie is equally nice to see !!
B003BKF6AU|5.0|great band and album! but sounds better live! an example is the song \\"ENGLAND\\" when they play live use a heavenly corns and trumpets (yeah in the album too) but sounds better live, this band live is amazing!!! same for all songs... better live!     and dont know if its me but the album can be better recorded... based in the live performances... anyway an amazing album!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I read a negative review of this movie that said it tried (and failed) to be all things to all people; political commentary, action film, engaging emotional storyline. I would beg to differ. This is a movie that stays with you for a few days on many levels. Highly recommended!
6305308659|5.0|Pleasantville is a unique, and timely comedy-drama starring Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, William H. Macy and J.T. Walsh in his final film performance. This tale of going down memory lane involves two teenagers(Maguire and Witherspoon) who given a special remote control for the TV set and zapped them to a 1958 black and white TV sitcom, where they are the children of TV parents(Macy and Allen). As they adapt to their new surroundings, the two teens show the rest of the Pleasantville community the beauty that they can experience, while at the same time the town is being colourized. The late Don Knotts also appears as the friendly TV repair man. Pleasantville is the kind of movie that can teaches us that it is okay to try everthing new and at the same time enjoy the wholesomeness that the 1950's has taught us. This film will warm every heart of every person who see it.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is a wonderful piece of Rock history presenting in a very entertained way the most intimate details around Rush: Ged, Alex & the new guy, how they got together and how they have survived more than 30 years filling our boring lives with great music!!!<br />Let me tell you that the scene were the guys are having dinner worth buying this movie!! I haven't laugh so hard in years!!<br />If you are a fan of Rush buy this thing right away eyes closed!!!
B001F0WXY0|5.0|A great book, that I would love to re-read after all these years, but I can't bring myself to pay 2x as much for a DIGITAL version of a book over a paperback. Penguin books seems to have an issue with digital, because all their digital books are grossly overpriced. It's too bad, if they made it the same price as the paperback, they'd sell a lot more copies. Join us in the digital age Penguin.
0061120081|4.0|Small mixup in shipment; but when it was brought to the seller's attention.   Readily and quickly took care of it.   Book as advertised.

B000SQKZKG|5.0|It was November, 1973 and at 16 I was still a novice at concert viewing. Before this show it was shows like Three Dog Night, Chicago and Bread! Wow! What a surprise! Never before and never again have I seen a better show! To see the massive speaker assembly on stage and the same on the opposite end of the arena was a sight for the eyes as well as the ears.   Those of us who got to see the show in Salt Lake City got a little different intro than the classic album title phrase. The night before their show the boys decided to go skinny dipping in the hotel outdoor pool. (In freezing temps mind you!) They were quickly arrested. So the intro at the show was \\"Direct from the Salt Lake County Jail...\\"     I play the cd and my youth is revisited! Still the best live album ever made! Enjoy it! I still do!
B003ASLJRW|4.0|there is no difference between the 2008 pale rider blu ray and the 2010 version aside from the packaging aspect ratio is 2:4:1 on both versions
0316044938|3.0|this book was nothing to brag about. I kinda lost interest in the reading so it was kind of hard to keep up. I really didn't picture it in my mind as I read this story, but I hope watching the movie will make this story more real for me.
1400052173|2.0|When she writes about cell biology, science, and the ethics of medical research, RS writes well.  When she writes about the woman behind the HeLa cells, she provides little more than a sketch of a life.  No surprise.  There is very little to document the life of HL, any more than there is to document the lives of the overwhelming majority of people on the planet.  Most life stories are just not that interesting in the telling.  And so it is with HL.  To be sure, the times she lived in, her family's place in the broader social history of the US, including the deplorable existence of race-based medicine and medical-research practices -- all of these are interesting in themselves.  But as SL demonstrates in this exhaustingly overlong book, there's simply not much to say about HL herself.  I can only assume RS realized this early on in her project, since she spends countless pages spinning out, in chapter after redundant chapter, the story of HL's descendants (her children for the most part).  How many times can we be told that the sons want financial compensation (I don't blame them), and that the daughter wants to connect with a mother she lost so young (my heart goes out to her).  TILoHL feels, at almost every turn, as though it has been stuffed, stuffed, and stuffed some more: with unnecessary dialogue, with unwelcome editorializing, with irrelevant scene setting.  And just when the bloat of this book threatens to burst through its seams, one arrives at one of the longest acknowledgment sections in the history of publishing.  For all the legions of people who were evidently involved in reading, researching, fact-checking, and providing feedback on versions of this book, one might suppose it truly were the outstanding piece of popular science reportage that many reviewers claim it to be.  I, for one, am at a loss to understand the hype.  TILoHL is exceedingly well documented.  It is also several hundred pages too long.  It would have made a fine New Yorker profile, not a book.  At least, not this one.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I think this is a great little quirky art film. Having married into a German family,I can relate to many of \\"Yasmin's\\" traits. I was recently able to view it on the \\"THIS\\" network. I forgot many of the subtle scenes and dream-like qualities of this film. I actually regard the yellow coffee carafe as a character in the movie. There's even a scene where it looks as though it's moving on its own. It is a \\"running gag\\" throughout. I would recommend Bagdad Cafe' like a strong cup of joe on a cold morning.
B002436WJE|5.0|Liam Neeson (\\"Shindler's List\\") stars in \\"Taken\\", one of the biggest films of 2008. In it Neeson plays a man who use to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and finds himself embroiled in trying to find his teenaged daugher who has been kidnapped by maniacs working for an Albanian sex slave operation in France.<br /><br /> The film is not for the weak: the torture scenes are violent, graphic, nail-biting, and extremely hair-raising which is why some of the scenes in the original version had to be cut in order for the film to receive a PG-13 rating. Those scenes that were cut are available on this two disc edition.<br /><br /> \\"Taken\\" is a well-acted, fast-paced movie that will not only please fans of actions movies, but fans of Liam Neeson; it's nice to see he finally has a huge hit on his hands. \\"Taken\\" took in over $222,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice on a $19,000,000 budget with DVD sales raking in more millions.<br /><br /> In June of 2010 Neeson announced that he is in talks to do a sequel to \\"Taken\\".
B000RHKARY|5.0|I know many people think Clapton can't be bettered, but for me Mick Taylor had an almost unique quality of smoothness that eclipsed most of the other bluesmen of any era.  When he played for the Stones, he changed their flavor much to the better.  For me this is the best Mayall ever did and I can listen to it over and over.  Not a weak track anywhere.  Anyone who skipped this one thinking what came before was superior is missing a goldmine.  Even Mayall's voice is at some sort of peak here.  If he has (or had) a weakness is is that.  But Taylor's guitar: it sings like few others.  Does it lack an edge; too refined; too white?  I'll take its sound any day.
B003MX5P20|3.0|I've always loved Enrique, but his releases follow the same construction:  1 super hit, 2 good songs and the rest filler junk.  \\"I Like It\\" is a fabulous song and I love it dearly.  The rest of the album is NOT \\"I Like It\\".  The Jersey Shore integration was really fun, but only for true fans of Jersey Shore.      Bottom line: Hardcore Enrique fans already have this CD.  Fence-sitters:  download the $.99 song \\"I Like It\\" and call it a day.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Purchased the Blu-Ray version and completely satisfied.  Outstanding narration as only David Attenborough can provide & exquisite film quality.  I read many other reviews prior to selecting this Blu-Ray disc set.  My home theater set-up and components are extremely good and they really allow the full scope of this work to be enjoyed to the fullest.  Even my 8 yr old grandson watched an entire disc...that's really saying something!  I've watched the full disc set once and I'm ready to enjoy it again with other friends and family.  The BBC \\"Earth\\" Blu-Ray Disc set is also highly recommended.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Got this in just a few days and was in excellent shape. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00025E1UI|5.0|I wouldn't pay this $70+ import price, but this soundtrack is awesome.  I've had it for years and listen to it often.  This four disc set pretty much has all the songs, the US version seemed to only have a small selection of pieces.    This is the first Final Fantasy soundtrack where Nubuo Uematsu enlisted help to make the soundtrack.  He and three other composers weaved a musical tapestry that ranges from heavy metal, to synth pop, and as always the traditional orchestral pieces that Final Fantasys are known for.
0061733199|5.0|I got interested in survival when I took some lessons about the subject. I wanted a book that taught about survival in a easy yet a detailed way, so i found this book in Amazon and bought it right away, at the beginning i had some doubts about my purchase, but when i got my hands on it i felt that i obtained more than i payed for. as i said before im just interested in the topic, but for being my first survival book i think is very complete and detailed, the illustrations are very good, the writing simple and direct, considering I'm not a native English speaker it was really easy to understand. i haven't finished yet, i just enjoy reading it. i have no complaints regarding the book, i would recommend it to anyone. maybe the only downside is that is aimed for first world countries, i mean for assembling a survival kit & pouch many utensils are not available however i can use some imagination and improvise. very good book.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I have wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer over a year ago. What looked to be just another \\"by the numbers\\" sophomoric comedy turns out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.<br /><br />This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for kids, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.<br /><br />As far as the violence involving this young actress, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.<br /><br />There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.<br /><br />Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays \\"Red Mist\\" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as \\"Big Daddy\\" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. \\"Hit Girl\\" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.<br /><br />While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.<br /><br />The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.<br /><br />In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!e.

0061205699|4.0|Although you tend to be forced to read it in grade school there's no doubt about the reasons why.  A book full of lessons and beautiful prose it's frightful if it's not on your list.  Sometimes it's slow like a southern drawl and other times it's as quick as a motorcycle.  It's sure to keep you interested if you give it the time of day.
0778328821|5.0|This book was a hard book to put down - I just wanted to keep on reading until the end
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I've heard so much about this band, and decided to check them out for myself. After listening to the 30-second clips a couple of times, I was still a little hesitant about buying it. I thought they sounded okay, but not great; I definitely wasn't seeing what all the hype was about. I decided to go ahead and buy it, though, and give it a chance. I am SO glad that I did! It only took listening through the album once, and I was hooked. These guys are excellent!
B001URY5IU|5.0|I needed input from my son who's the real expert: \\"It's based on a Hoth battle with Han Solo and a brand new, Lego creature--a Tauntaun! (this is exciting news) This has a special part where the figure can go flying when you push down on what they're standing on.\\"<br /><br />The stars are from our young user-expert, but as a parent, I would rate the educational value as a 4. The number of hours he plays with the Star Wars Lego set is pretty amazing (TV or video games get ignored). He uses a lot of imagination and takes mini movies of his playtime with creations.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|My first thought before ever even reading reviews for salt was that it looked dumb, so I was very skeptical about going to see it, but when I walked out of the theater I was very impressed!           The movie starts out with the U.S. interrogating a Russian who claims that a russian spy planted in the U.S. will assassinate the Russian president and that the spy name is Evelyn Salt which is the name of the CIA officer questioning him. Is she the spy or is she being set up? Watch the movie to find out!          If I could give this movie a 3.5 stars I would, because it was right on the edge of a 4 star movie! But I have to give it a three stars. I would still recommend going to see this movie because it's a good action thriller!
B001QOGYFO|5.0|I agree with the previous positive reviewers, and highly recommend this film.  It does what a good film should do, and that is keep you entertained by keeping things moving along at a good pace, steadily adding interesting story elements and ultimately building to a plausible ending.  It is first rate visually.
0316067598|5.0|Simply amazing. This true story about a 4 man Navy Seal team who goes deep into Afghanistan and all but one survive a onslaught of over 200 Taliban fighters.  The author is the lone surviving Navy Seal of the initial 4 man team, as well as the first rescue team of Navy Seals who get wiped out as well.  The training, talent, intelligence, perseverance, and patriotism of these men are second to none.  This is a must read for anyone who wants a firsthand account into what these brave and selfless men do for our Country, and for the people of Afghanistan.  This account also shows that not all in Afghanistan are enemies of the West.  A village of Pashtuns befriends the author and ends up protecting him with their lives from the Taliban fighters.  They don't know him, just met him, and yet are willing to put their lives on the line to save his life, and they do it without any reward.  In fact, they refuse any compensation or reward at all.  You will love this book, I promise.
0345495004|3.0|I agree with \\"Overrated\\" of 2007. Not a page-turner. The author seems to be overlaying the early 20th century characters with our modern standards, thoughts, and ideas, which makes Mamah especially annoying. FLW comes off as an egoist, as I think is well known to be true. He was a genius architect, but no one claims he was anything other than arrogant and selfish. The prose is well written, but you'll find yourself rolling your eyes at the preachiness, repetitiveness, silliness of the thoughts and motives of the heroine (particularly in her discoveries of women's rights and free love, and in her unfathomable obsession with FLW as a lover), and at the anachronistic observations and errors (e.g., Mamah and FLW went to tour the \\"cathedrals\\" of Florence; there is only one cathedral in Florence, the seat of the bishop; those other large structures they toured are correctly called \\"churches\\"). I'd recommend \\"Death in a Prairie House\\" instead, if you are interested in the topic.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This book made me laugh out loud. It is not a serious novel, and will probably be never studied in a University classroom. The ending was a bit \\"unbelievable\\" ... with her pushing for his secrets and so on. But overall I recomend it if you are in need of something light, something to help the mind relax.
B003HI3MSE|3.0|First off, I have to say that I do not typically take the time to review albums, but I felt as though I had no choice on this one. I have been a fan of Bullet since the beginning. The Poison was(and still is) one of my favorite metalcore albums of all time. I listened to it until the cd actually wore out. When I heard that Bullet was releasing Scream, Aim, Fire, I had very very high expectations. Scream, Aim, Fire blew me away. They changed their sound from punky screamo to thrash metal. It was as if I had watched Bullet grow up from boys to men. Scream, Aim, Fire is (in my opinion) the metal album to come out it years. So naturally I had very high expectations for Fever. I bought the CD the day it came out and listened to it through twice. Immediately I was disappointed. The album lacks the key elements that made Bullet who they were. The album sounds as generic as anything on the radio. Its as though Bullet as lost their edge and has changed everything that has made them who they are. Their are some songs that are \\"ok\\", but on the whole, this album is lacking in every way. It seems as though Bullet is headed in the same direction as Atreyu...commercialized. But I will not give up hope for them yet, I will just chalk this up as a 3rd CD flop, an experiment gone wrong. But if you are a dedicated fan, then you owe it to the band to buy their album. But please Bullet, I beg you do not change your ways for a more commercial friendly sound. Us metal fans have lost several bands in the last couple of years to commercialism, please do not follow down this road. (A7X, Atreyu, Disturbed, just to name a few)    p.s. If your looking for a good metalcore/metal album, go check out Witness by Blessthefall
B0015DROBO|3.0|I had high expectations and was disappointed by the book.  The plot seemed to unfold VERY slowly ... I kept reading & reading waiting for the story to become interesting.  I wouldn't classify this book as a \\"page turner\\" or a \\"must read\\".

6302579295|1.0|I was very disappointed because the VHS tape was not in good condition and was truly unviewable.  The  picture wasn't steady .  I gave up trying to view it after a short while.  Perhaps it might have been a good  performance if the VHS had been in good condition.  I love this opera and was shocked that a VHS would  be shipped in this poor condition.
B001LF347E|5.0|I was off one evening and ended up fliping channels and found Merlin a show from the BBC. I have been hooked ever since. The story focuses on young Merlin, kind of like a young Clark Kent in Smallville. I have had no interest in Merlin or King Arthur in the past but you do not have to be familiar with the story to enjoy this dragon's tail. The only thing that would have made this DVD set better is an Episode book with pictures of the cast members with their names. Trust me you will want to know who they are. The last DVD, that has extras on it, does introduce the cast but it would be nice to have something printed before watching the episodes. The only other suggestion I would make is to make the series longer. It is a 5 disc set but only 12 or so episodes for the entire season. I cannot wait for the release of seaon 2. I have my pop corn and rasinettes ready to go.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have a number of dvd and videos regarding WWII. One just bought prior to this set, \\"The Nazis\\". It was okay. This documentary, produced in 1974, is the best ever. It includes many interviews with people in the war. Now most are dead. I will not buy another WWII documentary because there is so little, if any, left out that at best a new one would be mostlly redundant. If you are a WWII buff, I highly recommend this set.

B000PMLFRA|4.0|George Lucas should let me trade in my VHS's, original LASERDISCs, Special Edition Laserdisc box set and DVD's and my tikcet stubs for the orignal release of each movie and then the special edition  releases of episodes 4-6 for a free BLU-RAY set. I shutter to think how much I have spent on Star Wars over the years.<br />That is not including the toys, light sabers, action figures, bedding, posters, cd's, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Now another 100 or so for another set?  and then all 6 movies in a new 3-d release at 15.00 - 20.00 minimum each per peron.<br /><br />I am not spending any more money on Star Wars.  Been there done that.<br /><br />Now if I can just explain this to my son when all this new stuff hits.
B001QERPDO|5.0|The Script's self-titled album is full of catchy, stuck-in-your-head-all-day songs.  I'm not quite sure what genre best describes them, if that matters.  Their songs range anywhere from rock, pop, soul, and r&b.  Some people have mentioned that they \\"rap\\" in some of their songs.  I think what they mean is that they do a bit of fast,rhythmic singing (especially on the track \\"We Cry\\", one of my favorites).  The lyrics are what make this band so special.  They are poingant and honest and relatable - no matter who you are or what you've been through.  When I sat down and read the lyrics along with the songs, there were some where I just broke down and cried.  Any artist that can move me, whether to tears or to scream in rage, gets my vote.  To me, it's also important that they are true musicians.  They had a hand in writing every song on the album, as well as playing their own instruments.  In my opinion, The Script is the signle best band to come out in the last few years and I'm really looking forward to seeing what else they can do!  I very highly recommend this CD!
B000127LW2|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Kate Mulgrew's work so I didn't really have much desire to watch any of the Voyager series but when I saw that Walmart had the complete season 1 for $[...] (regular every day price, same product as here!) I decided to give it a look see. I was suprised to find I like the show a lot. Still don't care for Kate but the other characters are amazing, especially Nelix. The package materials, as others have pointed out, are CRAP. I am going to pick up season 2 at Walmart ($[...]) to see what comes next.
1847242537|1.0|It's such a bugger to waste so much time hoping a book will turn out in some way beneficial. In no way do I see glorifying torture of women as appropriate use of my time.<br /><br />It is clear from SL's bio on his website that he has quite a few bones to pick politically. Fine, some interesting stories could be made, but do any of the stories have to include the incredible use of violence etc. where the men are the instigators and in some cases the \\"saviors\\" of these women? poppycock.<br /><br />Glad to see others disappointed they've wasted their time, too.
B003C5FMFI|4.0|Worthwhile listen for the serious Clapton fan and colector only. This is not Clapton at his best, but does capture a tentative, unsure artist on his comeback tour. Useful to contrast his playing on this tour with the 1975 tour on which he was more out in front and confident in his abilities.

0440241901|5.0|Great, face-paced novel that keeps you turning pages well into the night. That says a lot coming from me because I'm a hot-cold Sophie Kinsella reader -- really enjoy some of her books, The Shopaholic series however makes me want to scream (words can't describ how much I hated the series - couldn't even get past book 2 because the main character was so obnoxious & stupid).  This, however, is a great read with interesting characters.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's story is so inspiring, and teaches many Life Lessons, not the least of which is:  Live life each day to the best of that day's ability, and Never GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS.  If Susan had reached mediocre success in her 20's or 30's, then she would not have been the sensation she was, the SHOCK she was to Simon... and the instant celebrity success that her appearance gave her.  It's all in the timing.  God opens doors when HE is ready for us to show.  I think it was Abraham Lincoln who said after his many failures... \\"I will prepare myself, and my hour will arrive.\\"  Look how God used him when it finally became \\"His Hour\\"!!!  LOVE YOU, SUSAN!  You inspire me!

1594488843|5.0|Before reading Daniel Pink's \\"Drive,\\" I categorized it along with recent popular books like \\"Switch,\\" \\"Blink,\\" and \\"Tribes\\" into the trendy, one-syllable self-help/leadership genre.  And though I have nothing against those types of books, I generally find them to be more interesting than deeply impacting.  Having read through \\"Drive,\\" it far exceeded my expectations.    Pink's basic premise is that our present-day American society and economy require new motivations to bring about increasing levels of productivity, creativity, and fulfillment.  He suggests that our strictly physiological drives (hunger, thirst, sexuality) were sufficient when survival was the predominant need for humanity.  He suggests that a second set of motivations (what he calls \\"Motivation 2.0\\"), involving rewards to bring about desired behaviors and punishments to discourage unwanted behaviors (what he calls \\"carrots and sticks\\"), was sufficient in an industrial age when our economy required several generations of laborers to execute innumerable, repetitive, meaningless tasks.  But he suggests that an economy that increasingly depends on creative, innovative work requires a new set of motivations (\\"Motivation 3.0\\") to bring those endeavors to fruition.  And this Motivation 3.0 requires three elements (autonomy, mastery, and purpose) to drive our society into a desirable future.    Pink's book is peppered with references to the work of various social scientists to help validate his claims.  Though occasionally a bit tedious, this body of research paints a compelling picture for Motivation 3.0 (autonomy, mastery, and purpose), specifically in contrast to our society which runs almost exclusively on Motivation 2.0 (carrots and sticks).  This leads to his conclusion that the business world has chosen to ignore what science clearly knows about human motivation.  A philosopher friend of mine was rather annoyed that Pink seemed to suggest that this idea of moving towards intrinsic motivation has onlybeen discovered in the last 50 years, since the ancient Greek philosophers had much to contribute to the intrinsic/extrinsic conversation.  Though he may be a bit sloppy to ignore millennia of existing thought about this topic, Pink effectively utilizes significant sociological research to help support his thesis, at least to someone outside the social sciences.    As he describes the three elements that he considers central to Motivation 3.0 (autonomy, mastery, and purpose), Pink tells the stories of a number of organizations and businesses who have already adopted operating systems designed to foster a working environment driven by intrinsic motivation.  He discusses companies that grant their workers 20% of their work-time to undesignated projects, wherein employees can tackle whatever projects personally excite them.  There are even a few companies that have embraced a model without any particular guidelines for hours and location.  Employees can work wherever they want, whenever they want, as long as they get results.  Though these models are paradigm-shattering for those of us with more traditional understandings of appropriate workplace environments, his examples were at least intriguing, if seemingly a bit idealistic.    My greatest struggle with \\"Drive\\" was trying to imagine the implementation of its basic principles in various settings.  All of his examples emerged within the innovative technology sector, where creativity and invention rule the day.  But many of us work in different environments, where other tasks besides innovation predominate.  Frankly, in my work on a church staff, it is unclear to me what it would look like for us to practice Pink's ideas.  What would it mean for me to have 20% of my working hours devoted to undesignated projects of my choice?  I don't work in a field where I even know how to envision such a model.    In many ways, I think the sign of a good book is whether it disturbs my intellectual equilibrium.  Since I finished the book a week ago, I have had cause to think about how we are motivated and how we motivate others in a host of different arenas.  If Pink is right, then coaches need to rethink how they train their athletes.  Parents need to rethink how they raise their children.  Educators need to rethink how they educate their students.  And certainly bosses need to rethink how they lead their employees.  I'm not completely convinced yet (at least of the universal applications of Pink's ideas), but I can't stop thinking about the possibilities.  And that indicates a book worth reading for anyone willing to set aside some common assumptions and consider if there may be a better way for us to be motivated and to motivate others than the normal operating system in the early 21st century in America.

B002ZG995E|5.0|The A-Team is what movies used to be and should be now: fun. We used to herald the mindless summer blockbuster back when the explosions were fire and not CG, when Bruce Willis was all you needed to make a movie great, and an excellent plot was something you only expected to find in dramas filled with stuffy British accents. Yes, the majority of film has always sucked but we didn't care because we weren't paying $12.50 to see what's being shuffled down our throats today. As indie film has taken over the mutliplexs, the only escape we have to someplace fun is through stuff with Shia Lebouf in it. Disgrace, I tell you! But not all is lost. We have people like Joe Carnahan who still know how to make a night at the movies a blast.    Now, the critics panned this movie because it's short on plot and way too loud. Dude, it's based on The A-Team. The A-Team was a show about fast and violent missions with Mr. T preferring not to fly and Hannibal loving when a plan comes together. You didn't watch The A-Team for MASH, you watched it because it was cool. And that's exactly what this movie is. Cool. It's a thrill ride from the very beginning to the very end and not a lot of movies can deliver on that promise. Some twists are predictable and you're satisfied when you see it coming. Some are not and you're satisfied because you're surprised. I don't want to spoil anything about the story but the basic plot is all you really need. This movie is a video game in that you first get the reason to want to shoot things and then all you want to know next is where to get the ammo. It's loud and shaky, as is the trend with today's action movies, but not obnoxious like that other \\"we were framed and now we're super mad about it. As a team because camaraderie is important\\" movie, The Losers. Plus Sharlto Copley and Liam Neeson are fine, fine actors and you can't go wrong with 'em.
B003CN5B6K|5.0|This is an awesome show! I love the character development between Neal and Peter, and the relationship between Peter and his wife. I also love that it's a clean show and I can watch it with my 10- and 13-year-old kids.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|As usual, this season was as wonderful as the others. John Lithgow is one of my favourite actors--being a wonderful and generally kind man, yet so able to step out of that element. I grew up watching Third Rock from the Sun, and when I heard he was to play a role in Dexter, I was immeasurably excited. It does not disappoint. Barring that, Keith Carradine returned, one of my favourite characters as well. So it was full of excitement.    The plot is devious and quite suspenseful. I was curious and worried how they were to deal with the baby and it is executed well. If you have enjoyed the first three seasons, you should enjoy this as well.    My only annoyance is that I'm not very fond of Quinn, and as always, am a little annoyed to see him around still.
0439023483|5.0|The will to survive kept me turning the pages!  I really enjoyed this book!
0307454541|2.0|The book is just not as good as critics and readers lead you on to believe.  It is in drastic need of serious editing (do we need to know pointless details about each meal and tedious activity the characters are engaged in?).  I think the book has an interesting premise (locked room mystery on an island with a large cast of strange family members), but it is a rambling mess.  Seriously, this could have been cut down to 350 pages (from 600) and it would have had a much greater impact on the reader.  Especially if the overly detailed descriptions of violence against the female characters was cut down.  It's unfortunate, because I think the author is probably trying to make a point about violence against women, but he takes it soooo far that it becomes the main focus on the novel--for all the wrong reasons.  You start to think that the author thought about these details so much that he was pretty sick himself.  There is way too much detail about rape, abuse, pedophiles, and violence against women to make me confident that Mr. Larsson has/had sincere intentions of shedding light on society's problems rather than just making a ton of money off of some his own sick fantasies.
B002ZG999U|2.0|All of the trailers and TV spots have given people the idea that The Expendables  unites as many of the biggest action film stars in one film and promises to be one of the bloodiest and explosive films in recent memory. So to expect strong writing or a coherent story in a film like this would just be absurd, so I thought that expecting an entertaining action film and nothing more would fit the mold perfectly. Somehow the film still managed to be an out of control mess.<br /><br />The writing was cringe-worthy. It felt like we were thrown into a film that had already established a back story, but maybe that's what they were going for since most of these actors have action films that they're associated with. The dialogue will probably make you groan at how corny it is at times. If Mickey Rourke's speech about putting a Charlotte's Web tattoo on Jason Statham's \\"perfect, round head\\" wasn't improvised, then that is really disappointing as Rourke seemed to struggle on spitting the words out during that scene. The Expendables certainly felt like it filmed all the big action sequences first and then tried to throw together a script and a story at the last minute. One of the most humorous aspects of the film was the fact that it had to make a big deal about Steve Austin's character not having any objections to roughing up women when he was accused of abusing them in real life.<br /><br />With this many stars in the film, you can probably guess that it isn't very well balanced. Getting all of these action stars in one film is certainly an achievement, but most of them don't have much screen time. The first half of the film seems to be very Jason Statham heavy while the rest of the film is mostly Stallone. Jet Li and Mickey Rourke have a few scenes where they stick out while Dolph Lundgren seems to sit on the sidelines for most of the film. If you're going into this film expecting a larger role from someone who isn't in this paragraph, then you'll probably be disappointed due to how small their role really is.<br /><br />The film is capable of delivering some bone-crunching and blood soaked fight sequences in addition to an incredible amount of explosions that would even make Michael Bay contemplate whether or not he's had this much destruction in one film. Some of the ways that people die in the film are gloriously gruesome while the film shines brightest during the scenes where Barney's team is too busy fighting to say much of anything. Most of the action scenes in Vilena, the car chase that ends with the fight between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren, and the finale of the film are all deliciously explosive, fast paced, and hit hard enough to satisfy most action film fans.<br /><br />The Expendables is poorly written and rather brainless, but is capable of giving its audience exactly what it advertised and that's deliver one of the loudest action films ever that features quite possibly the greatest gathering of action stars in any film. If you're somehow able to ignore the disconnected storyline and stupefyingly simple dialogue, then you'll probably be able to enjoy the clutter of explosive and fast paced action.eir role really is.

0061714372|4.0|I've been a Megadeth fan since the mid-80's, so when I saw Dave finally had an autobiography coming out, I pre-ordered it on Amazon and devoured it upon arrival. The stories here are excellent and often funny, the photos are great, and there's a consistent point of view throughout the book.<br /><br />This is \\"Dave's Journey\\" and it reads first-person and straightforward from his childhood to the present with few extended sidetracks, although I would have loved to know more about the backstage tension during the \\"Clash of the Titans\\" tour in 1990-1991, or why Chris Poland returned to play on \\"The System Has Failed.\\" (He's not mentioned at all in in that chapter.)<br /><br />I also have no problem with Dave venting about being kicked out of Metallica. From a fan's standpoint, that anger fuels some of the best Megadeth music, so if that's his muse, then I'm all for it. In discussing Metallica in this book, Dave basically portrays James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich as a couple of poseur magpies.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is what seems to be unfinished fact checking/proofreading. This book isn't something Dave wrote and distributed from his laptop--he recruited an award-winning co-author (Joe Layden) to put things in order, and it's published by HarperCollins. So as I was reading it, I was surprised to find:<br /><br />1) Dave saying he played Def Leppard covers with his band Panic in the late 70's, when Def Leppard's first album \\"On Through the Night\\" didn't come out until 1980;<br /><br />2) The photo caption on page 197: \\"Me with my Dean Angel of Death VMNT\\" (the guitar is actually spelled \\"Deth\\") next to a photo of a late-80's Dave holding a Jackson V. The photo on P. 272 has no caption, but it's clearly a recent photo of Dave playing his Dean Angel of Deth VMNT--this is where the caption was probably supposed to go.<br /><br />3) P. 231: Dave talks about voting for Bill Clinton in 1990. The election was in 1992, which Dave actually mentions on the previous page.<br /><br />4) Legendary record producer Dave Jerden's name is misspelled as \\"Jurdin\\" twice.<br /><br />These are just the mistakes that jumped out at me without any effort--there could be more. The only upside to this is, corrections can be made on e-books, and in subsequent paperback printings. What a shame though, because Dave is a musician known for his precision, and his book should be a reflection of that from the start.
B00169N0BK|4.0|Love the calibration tool, don't care much for the software. Not that user friendly.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|The original l981 production of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was a wonderful crowd-pleaser that should never have been remade.<br />It was cast with beautiful and talented performers, sparkled with terrific monsters from the genius hands of Ray Harryhausen, and a brisk, fast-moving story that kept the action zooming along--and yes, the Kraken monster, was a terrific nightmare.<br />Switch to the year 2010 where nearly every movie playing at the multi-plex are atrocious remakes (i.e, \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\"), lousy sequels or prequels. This latest reboot of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" is a perfect example.<br />Instead of the adorable Harry Hamlin, who wore only a skimpy loincloth, we have a buzz-cut Sam Worthington who looks like a wimp from the year 2010.  He wears the same neck-to-knee costume throughout when the role screams for a powerful, muscular hero, like Stone Cold Steve Austin or Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson. His modern buzz cutis the same one he sported in \\"Avatar. The story moves like crude oil and by the time we FINALLY see the Kraken, we've already been bored to death.<br /><br />We can't blame Sam Worthington for trying to bring life to his boring role. The director just crammed each frame with deafening noise and music. When will these hack movie-makers realize that if you're going to remake a swords-and-sandals epic, fans want to see as much beef and muscle as possible and try making something fresh and original. The tens of millions of dollars that was poured into his \\"reboot\\" could easily have been spent in creating a brand new classic that could turn out endless sequels--like the Hercules movies made in the l960s by that spectacular legend of male beauty--Steve Reeves!

And they did the show four times they were so popular and Ed Sullivan liked the polite boys too.  I was later taken with The Monkees more than The Beatles.  Now at age 54 I can't get enough of those fab boys from Liverpool.  Yes I have seen these videos before, but I have pre-ordered them for release later this year from Amazon.

B000SEGCRS|5.0|As a long-time \\"prosumer\\" experienced with film, point and shoot, and dSLR photography, I highly recommend this series.  I noticed that the reviewers who do not like the book still think the advice is worthwhile.  Kelby's books are full of brief, easy-to-understand tips that will help you capture phenomenal photos.  What I really like is that you get quick information on the settings required for a specific type of shoot (i.e. sports, fireworks, landscape, etc.).  If you are new to digital photography and need to learn the basics, start with the \\"Digital Photography for Dummies\\" and then get this book.
0571195709|5.0|Popular culture would like us to believe that men who feel inclined to leave their families are monsters.    This book presents a broader picture. How the motivation of a man is almost entirely the same as a woman that leaves a husband: the search for love, the search for passion, the search for meaning.    I really thought I would end up loathing this main character but instead I felt a measure of sympathy and humanity towards him.     I will be less judgmental about marriage and divorce after this book.    Stylistically this book is beautiful. Not only is short and hard-hitting but its so clean. I think the contradiction between the cleanliness of the writing and the pain that is on display is one of the best things about this novel.    Well done Mr Kureishi.
B0032JTV74|5.0|My wife and I love Glee.  First off I am a music addict.  I love music of all kinds so the Lady Gaga episode was fantastic.  Second, I am a 54 year old male who probably breaks the age group geared for this show.  I have an Aunt who is 80 years old and loves this thing called Glee.  Third, I bought the first set of dvds, you know the 13 episodes, because I couldn't wait for Glee to return to finish the season and then buy the whole set.  I was upset that they chose to release a complete season after I had bought the first installment, but I knew all the details about how they would do it and I bought the set anyway.  When I discovered the impending release of the Bluray version I said what the heck I am buying Bluray and give or sell my first set to someone who wants to watch and see for themselves how great Glee really is.    I had two boys and they grew up and are now gone, but I know how teens have to deal with todays problems and it isn't easy.  The creators of Glee deal with these situations realistically and truthfully and with musical numbers that fit the moment.  BRAVO!!!!!

It is really worth watch them all and hearing what they have to say about the songs and what was going on during the time each video was made. I'm \\"Mad Fer It!\\" Though I am biased, being a massive fan of Oasis.

B000E5KJEI|1.0|I got this dvd as a gift for my brother . I recieved it ,gave it to him . He was disapointed. The dvd did not play. I tried it in too more dvd players , no luck. It might be that its just one dvd that was damaged. I'm still interested in the dvd . but I would like to get one that will play. The dvd was listed as new. That is why I gave it a 1 rating.

I needed to find some up beat music, I know e has good music heard one of his songs on the radio and ran out and got the cd.the lyrics are brutal but beats are great!  I listen to when working-out and keeps my mind focus on the reason about some things.    I give it a thumbs up...
B003K3OF78|1.0|For goodness sake, DO NOT download the whole album! Listen well to the samples and don't assume a song will get better than what you hear there. Then download probably two tracks and resign yourself to listening to Hopes and Fears or Under the Iron Sea again for a year or so more while you hope for better.    Imagine a whole album of the worst parts of Perfect Symmetry, and that's what Keane have delivered here.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|all of the negative reviews i have read about this movie are saying, \\"too much blood and violence\\".... \\"the bible doesn't say Jesus was lashed 80 times it was only 40 times\\"....  if there is one thing i have learned through 12 years of private, catholic schools... is that the bible is not 100% correct 100% of the time... NO ONE ON EARTH knows how Jesus was actually treated or how bad it actually was... so before you go bashing Gibson for making this movie.... maybe you should think about the fact that this movie is based off of a book that was written thousands of years ago.... this day in age, a lot of stuff is exaggerated, and a lot of stuff is made to seem like less of a \\"big deal\\"... whose to say the same didnt happen back then?  Whats going to happen in thousands of years when someone finds a Harry Potter book in some rubble?  the point is, not a single person in the ENTIRE world has any sort of right what-so-ever to say that this is \\"not how it happened\\" or Mel Gibson was in the wrong making this movie.  This is Mel Gibsons re-imagining of what happened...  This is an amazing movie that brings (parts of) the bible to the mainstream... opening a lot of peoples eyes.  who are you to say it is wrong? and to the people who are talking bad about this movie because of Mel Gibsons personal life.... i thought God teaches everyone forgiveness.... that there is no judge but \\"the\\" judge... i didnt know his personal life was reflected in the movie.... but overall... amazing, moving, visually stunning, all around great movie.  5 stars!

0061922315|5.0|I absolutely adored this book.  It was a wonderful story with terrific character development and had just the right balance between the parallel story lines.  I did have one disappointment, however: I would have liked to see Kavita and Asha meet before the end of the book. There was something unfinished, in my opinion, about the author not taking that step with the story.  Could there possiby be a sequel??  In any event, I do hope that the author will publish again - I will definitely buy her books!

B00000J7SS|5.0|It's hard to know what is possibly left to say about this album, other than to attempt to verbalize my own impressions. In the largely formless spirit of Bitches Brew, I'll start somewhere in the middle and raise an outright objection to all those who have claimed that Miles Davis 'sold out' or 'commercialized' his music. It may have been the best-selling jazz album ever at the time, but in no way whatsoever does this resemble anything remotely commercial. Whatever else it is, it is purely interpretive, visionary, experimental, and uncompromised music. It is music that sounds like nothing else ever recorded before or since. It is music that burrows in and buries itself, permanently, in the consciousness of the listener. It is confrontational, urgent, primal, intense, and mostly brilliant music. It is not, like its electric predecessor In A Silent Way, founded on subtlety and beauty. There is beauty in a sense to be found within the truth and sheer creativity and energy disseminated by the many great musicians it features, but Bitches Brew is more about being a unmitigated reflection of the time in which it was realized. Probably nothing speaks more serviceably for the anguished chaos that was 1969 than its contents. It is at times a jarring, violent, frightening experience. I can't imagine anything more unsettling on record.    I'll go to the beginning for now and posit that the first three minutes of the leading track, \\"Pharoah's Dance\\", contains the best the album has to offer. It sounds at first like a miraculous extension of Silent Way, a whirlpooling aggregate of instruments somehow working in perfect sync with each other, playing differently heard elements based on a single mode, so dark and yet iridescent at once. Miles' trumpet then comes in and it seems to throw the precision a little out of whack; in fact, the cohesiveness does not really resume for another ten or so minutes, when Miles finally states the central, repeating theme of the piece around whichthe others build a hair-raising crescendo. But it turns out that was nothing: the horn-echoed introduction (and ending) of the following track, \\"Bitches Brew\\", will make that hair stand all the way on end. Every single time you hear it. Very few moments in the history of contemporary music are as thrilling, as ominous, and as indelibly powerful as these sections, which more or less bookend a heavy-grooved onslaught of ferocity that scarcely manages to float above the threshold of 'free' - achieving an amazing balance by retaining just enough control in the face of so much apparent dissonance. When Miles lets loose with a forceful, clarion note that extends through Dave Holland's snaking, descending bass line and the surrounding, menacing cacophony feeding from it, it's as though you're on a rollercoaster, nudged over the top and plummeting into depths of sound and feeling not usually encountered.    The second side is more of a mixed bag. 'Spanish Key' has its moments, but overall sounds less focused. The brief track named for its chief protagonist, \\"John McLaughlin\\", on the other hand, is markedly more engaging in its concentration, built around a couple of nifty keyboard riffs. Although Miles himself is strangely absent from the song, it's probably the most effective way to introduce outsiders to the concept of the album without fear of freaking them out; it's easily the most accessible portion of the album, one of the few areas that can be cited for going with a more rock-oriented approach (though even here it is hardly straightforwardly rock; the only time Davis really covered that ground was in his next album, Tribute to Jack Johnson). Meanwhile, the longest track of them all, \\"Miles Runs The Voodoo Down\\", is also the least of them. After a few minutes at the outset that seem to hone in on a funkier element, the music becomes plodding and aimless. It may be said that some of the other works similarly lack direction for extended periods, but they are played withsuch captivating vitality and communicate so much that one hardly cares where they're 'going', so long as they're going at all. Not so here. \\"Sanctuary\\", however, ends the monumental record on a strong note. It's Wayne Shorter's last great moment playing with Davis, and unless you're a fan of Weather Report, one of his last great moments to date, period. It's also Miles' greatest performing contribution to the album, as the inherent space of the composition plays to his strength: immaculately selective phrasing conveyed with breathtaking sensitivity. Although there are a few emotional outbursts from the rest of the band in places (which I suppose keeps with the general essence of the sessions, but I prefer the version of this song included on Circle In The Round, which excludes the superfluous fury of the multiple percussionists in favor of letting the high-pitched horn culmination - an unmistakable cry of the spirit - speak for itself), the song leaves a more contemplative imprint upon the listener after all the reactionary sound and fury that came before.    At which point one is left with no words - for a little while. So much has rained down on you, grabbed you by the throat, forced you to see what and how these musicians saw and thought, to change the way you think about music, about expression, about form, about life itself. Not even Kind of Blue could do all that. You don't know where to start, what to begin to think, but take a moment for now to thank the stars for Miles Davis, for his discerning ability to employ so many incredible people who could bring his conceptions to life, for his commitment to bold and pure artistry, for daring to offend a vast percentage of his fan base and critics stuck behind illusory walls of genre. Miles Davis played a 38-minute, continuous, wholly improvised set at the Isle of Wight months after Bitches Brew was released. Someone asked him what it was that he and his band had played. He said, \\"Call it anything.\\" Who cared, except people that didn't get it, what exactly it was? The best of his music from this period is dynamic enough to be anything and everything. Few people in any form of art or walk of life have achieved this; perhaps it is the best in the rest of us to at least recognize and respond to it.
0307474712|3.0|At first I was confused with what I was reading. For some reason I didn't get that the book was one specific date of each year and we were going over that date for 20 years. I thought the book was going to be one day in these people's lives. (Like the TV show 24.) Once that was cleared up it made more sense to me, so now we know what the story is basically about, it's all based around two people from the day that they met one another and how they come and go in one another's lives. There are other reoccurring characters within the story as well. Because of this format we can see how much someone's life and relationships change over the years, which is interesting to view someone else's life like this, from the outside in.<br /><br />While I didn't feel compelled to like either of the main characters, I did find that I was moved enough that I did cry during part of the story. I think that if the main characters had more charm and were less destructive or whiny I would have had an easier time caring for either one of them. As this story is being made into a movie I can only hope that the actors will bring this missing element to the big screen so that I will feel more invested in them.
0385334206|3.0|I'm 35, have been working with books for well over a decade, and had never read a Vonnegut book 'til now. Needless to say, I've been very much aware of the man. A high percentile of co-workers and customers and friends through the years have sworn by Vonnegut. Skims every so often failed to lure me in, but a copy of \\"BoC\\" fell into my hands recently, so I thought, okay, let's see what this guy is about already.    I think I might have been more into it had I read it when I was younger, which is when people usually begin their acquaintanceship with his books. At this point, however, there's nothing remotely revelatory in his satire. It's all rather savagely caustic, and rightly so on most counts. But the foibles of America and Americans is (as it was then) the most obvious of targets, and I don't read books in order to knowingly nod my head in agreement.  For one who isn't all the way through the looking-glass, so to speak, this book is perhaps to be recommended. If you've already been caught up and learned to observe the illusory spectacles of the hyper-capitalist world for what they are, it's not a particularly enlightening perusal of 300 pages.    Or really, 200 pages, since so much space is needlessly wasted with deliberately juvenile drawings which, from my perspective, are far more irritating than amusing. Where Vonnegut's infusion of high comedy is concerned, I admit to laughing out loud once - it was at the description of one of Kilgore Trout's plot synopses - but only that once. The \\"and so on\\"s and other repetitive devices just don't strike me as terribly witty. The elementary-school presentations of adult subjects made me feel as if I was reading a prose version of Shel Silverstein. Taking this in, along with the cavalier vulgarity which is as much a unifying theme as anything actually useful in the writing, leaves one with the sense that Vonnegut may have been a little too irreverent for his own good.     The cheap metaphysics thrown in toward the end with Vonnegut inserting himself into the \\"plot\\" is moderately compelling - the rumination on free will (or, if he's truly as cynical as it would appear, the lack thereof) is about as clear a true theme as there is to be found here amongst all the bilious contempt heaved forth from his pen - but the book is so thoroughly muddled and glibly haphazard (there are so many characters who appear briefly or float peripherally around Trout and Dwayne Hoover that it makes you wonder if Vonnegut had any idea while he was writing if they were going to reappear later in the book or not) that it seems sort of out of place by that point to suggest there is any serious agenda in mind other than to effectively offend the mindset of anything and anyone he apparently considers to be typically American. And while that kind of thing can elicit more than a few knowing grins, mostly it's just kind of boring. Vonnegut doesn't do a whole lot more here to create a air of substance than the various elements of society that he's too busy idly skewering like a Mad magazine staffer. Frankly, he seems a little too proud of his artlessness to convincingly create the effect that he's in fact exploring deep literary or philosophical concerns. I do believe Vonnegut very much had intentions of being a serious author, but he works so hard to get in his own way of being taken seriously that one is more likely to be left with a different impression instead.     So no, I wasn't overly impressed. I might give him another shot but I'm not in any hurry.
0756405890|5.0|OK, I wasn't sure how to feel about this book when I first picked it up. The name and brief description, plus relation to Harry Potter works (which I also enjoy) gave me the incentive to try it out. And boy, am I glad I did!    This is a fantastic story. It's deep. I mean it. The book has a powerful emotional impact everyone can relate to. There are also bits of prose throughout the book which are so stunningly written, they are almost poetic.     Rothfuss doesn't \\"fuss\\" about ridiculous little details. He will give you everything you need to picture someone clearly without going overboard. His skill lets your brain paint the portrait with his suggestions.     The story progress at a very natural pace, without seeming to rushed or going too slow.    This ranks up there with Martin, Lynch, and Bakker for me.    Highly recommended.
B000ESST6U|5.0|Giulio Cesare is surely one of the most beautiful operas ever composed.  Why it isn't performed as regularly as Turandot, Traviata and Carmen et.al. can be best explained by the iron cultural grip of a traditional operatic vision that sees Art and Entertainment as mutually exclusive.  (Try a quick scan of Youtube videos of earlier productions' arias. They're almost always static: a (sometimes mountainous) singer, planted centerstage, stands and gives a costume recital.)  The astounding success of Glyndebourne's fluid and kinetic production may prove the beginning of the end of that archaic concept's domination.    Handel's soaring melodies and inviting rhythms are the perfect vehicle for David McVicar's lively staging and keen sense of visual humor.  And the multi-talented (and visually jaw-dropping) Danielle De Niese is the pluperfect soprano (and dancer, actress, comedienne) to animate this lushly visual and musical performance.  It's not that all the other singers aren't aren't also stunning in their own roles (yes, all of them) but the seductive Cleopatra is the opera's dramatic and musical center, even if Caesar got the title.    The accusation of \\"Bollywood\\" staging carries deservedly negative freight.  Incongruous & frivolous intrusions of pop-culture song & dance routines have ruined many serious and historical Indian movies.  But McVicar (in his on-disk interview) intends to own the term rather than deny it.  Dancing, motion, and comedy fit seamlessly into Giulio Cesare with no sense of intrusion--unless you're permanently locked into the Art vs. Entertainment dichotomy.  If you browse viewer responses online (Netflix, Youtube, etc.) you'll find that while people overwhelmingly loved the Glyndebourne production.  Those that didn't often wrote reviews (nearly always targeting McVicar and De Niese in particular) that read like hate mail (Amazon reviewers seem more civilized).  Gives you an idea of how much they feel is at stake. Perhaps the exclusivity of refined connoisseurship will be lost if aficianados of Broadway are admitted into the operatic citadel.      William Christie's musical direction blends wonderfully with the stage action, and the period instruments--particularly the horns and theorbo--sound better than anything I heard in other productions with modern instruments on Youtube.  Opus Arte's DVD is worth mentioning, too.  DTS sound, fine resolution and smooth editing pull you onto the stage and into the music as if you were there.  The Wagnerian length of this masterpiece (3 full DVDs) rather than being tiresome, is one of its greatest assets.  This is the only opera DVD I own (I usually rent) and despite being a hardcore cheapskate I'm thinking of rebuying it on Blu-Ray.
B00005JM02|5.0|I have a thing for Pixar movies (you know, unless they star a bunch of uninspired vehicles) and this film was really the start of my adoration for them.  Sure, everyone and their mother (and my three-year-old) loves `Toy Story', but it is `Finding Nemo' that really spoke to me as a moviegoer and as a human being, and it is a film that continually reaches the pit of me, now more so than ever since I became a father.<br /><br />Beautifully inspired and sentimentally executed, `Finding Nemo' is one of the more heartfelt offerings from Pixar.  It follows the adventure of a tragedy stricken clownfish, Marlin, as he searches the depths of the sea for his one and only son Nemo.  Marlin has already suffered enough in his life (the films outset discloses to us a savage attack that leaves Marlin a widower among other things) and so as his young son grows older he finds himself more and more protective as he is forced to loosen the reigns.  When Nemo is abducted by a scuba-diver, Marlin becomes frantic and begins a seemingly pointless search for his son.  Along the way he meets a series of odd fellows, not the least of which is Dory, one of the funniest creations in the history of animated cinema.<br /><br />And that pretty much sums up the bulk of this beautiful tale.  What makes `Finding Nemo' so effortless and impressionable is the fact that it truly balances out every aspect of the film with a finesse and subtle honesty that is lost in a lot of animated features.  Instead of going for a bounty of obvious laughs, `Finding Nemo' crafts something that feels more personal and pure.<br /><br />It goes for the heart.<br /><br />Pixar is known now for delivering moving experiences, upping the ante so-to-speak for animated filmmakers the world around, daring them to create something that defies the boundaries experienced within the genre.  With nearly all of their films they have done that very thing.<br /><br />As a father, I really connect with the sentiment presented in this film.  You can feel the unwavering love that Marlin feels for Nemo.  In knows no bounds.  He is Marlin's world.  Nemo is Marlin's only connection to a past he wishes was his present.  He lost so much and so he invests every ounce of his time to making sure that he never loses what he still has.  This has created within him a deep appreciation for his son, but it also has created an unbalanced view of his parental obligations, something that served as a hindrance and something that he needed to correct (or at least smooth out).  I know how it feels to want to smother the innocence of your child with protection.  You never want anything to harm them, whether it be physical or emotional.  That said; protection when abused can become destructive, and that is something that Marlin needed to realize.  For me, `Finding Nemo' beautifully broaches the complexities of parenthood without trying to be preachy or too literal.  It simply allows the audience to soak in the purity as it comes.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the film looks beautiful too (in all it's undersea wonderment).that Marlin feels for Nemo.

0451228375|5.0|In 1989 Ken Follett, then a relatively successful writer of modern suspense fiction, produced an epic about the construction of a medieval cathedral over a century. It was a considerable departure for him, his previous work all being more or less contemporary, and built around plots involving espionage and warfare. Suddenly, here was a book that wasn't a suspense novel at all, but rather a Michener-like tome dealing with a relatively mundane, of very interesting, topic: the construction of a cathedral, with all of the detail and knowledge that goes into such a thing. There were a number of interesting characters, well-defined and fascinating, and the cathedral itself is almost a character. While Follett isn't a writer of distinction (he's more of a story-teller) his workmanlike prose serves reasonably well, and the result is a fascinating story.    So the book was released, it initially it sold only pretty well. However, it didn't suffer the usual fall-off in sales that his (and most other) books had happen to them. Instead, its sales continued on, and it's become his bestselling book (so I understand). People approached him regularly asking whether he intended to do a sequel, and he finally gave in and did one. This book, \\"World Without End\\", is the result.    The action takes place 200 years later. The story builds around the repair of part of the cathedral, after the roof falls in, and the construction of a bridge nearby. The story begins with four young children hiding in the woods while playing, and watching a knight be attacked by a pair of men-at-arms. He survives and the men-at-arms don't, and he enters the local monastery, living there as a monk while the events of the story swirl around him and the rest of the characters. Two brothers, one a knight and the other interested in constructing things, diverge in their paths as the story goes on, while a pair of young women also choose different paths, working in the fields or serving as prioress of the local nunnery. The politics of the era, with the nuns and monks competing for attention and contribution money, is interesting, and halfway through the book the plague appears and strikes down half the cast of the book over several hundred pages.    I really enjoyed the book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the period or the subject. It's long, and detailed, but it reads well and is interesting. I would recommend that you read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" first, but both books are quite good.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I have been a 30 Rock, The Office, and Modern Family fan for a while and thought nothing could top the trio of comedy. Then I watched an episode of the Big Bang Theory.

With the DVD, now I can watch them all again.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|David Attenborough is not only a Naturalist but does these types of videos with authority. His voice, narrative is unsurpassed.    I am not knocking Oprah, in fact hers may be good for the real little ones (6-13). But for most adults David Attenborough is the man.    The video is awesome regardless and lives up to BBC quality. The video is crystal clear and the images are astonishing. Also make sure you watch after the video where they tell you about the making of the film. You will find that equally interesting.
1401307787|4.0|When Kabat-Zinn wrote \\"Wherever You Go, There You Are\\" he exposed the reader to the fifth wall of mindfulness.  What is the fifth wall? Having an actor in the family is quite educational. You learn things you might never know otherwise like the concept of the fourth wall. The fourth wall is the invisible boundary between the audience and the actors. The fifth wall takes it even further. How do I mean? Well, television has been described in the [[ASIN:1579583946 Encyclopedia of Television]] as the fifth wall because we can see beyond the four walls. On television, we can observe the wings of a bee moving in 'slow' motion.<br /><br />Kabat-Zinn's book inspired me to gear down. What I got from the book was simple. If I focus hard even and I am still enough in my thoughts, I can see beyond the four walls of my mind's chatter. I can observe the tiny imperfections in the tile and I can taste the cold water on a hot day that seems so refreshing and enjoyable. I have meditated off and on for many years. I even studied with a \\"master\\" for a brief time. Unlike [[ASIN:1590300165 Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom]] or [[ASIN:1573226564 Buddhism Without Beliefs: A Contemporary Guide to Awakening]] this book is more of a guide. It takes a simple, clear path to the concept of meditation.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|I was initially going to buy the Discovery Channel version that was narrated by Oprah, but accidentally bought the BBC version.  I watched it and it was amazing!!  I thought I would rent the Discovery Channel's version of Life and I found that the show is actually identical but you have to listen to Oprah versus the the more sophisticated english accent of David Attenborough.  The commentary in the BBC version doesn't sound \\"dumbed down\\" as it does in the one with Oprah.  I feel like this version was made for adults and the other was made for kids.  Hands down, this was fortunate accident that I'll never regret.  Great buy!!

0896898288|2.0|Laurie did an adequate job of restating the stories told by the farmers' wives.  The stories, however, are sappy and badly outdated.    As to the quilt portion of the book, she does not even appear to have any knowledge as a quilter.  There are no instructions for assembling the various blocks and the templates are more often wrong than right.  As a result, the quilter is on her own to recalculate each and every piece of each and every block.  Gee, why did we need your book, Laurie?  Even an experienced quilter would become frustrated with this project.    If you want to make a sampler quilt based on historical blocks, do the Sylvia's Bridal Quilt or one of the Civil War quilts instead.  Those books are well written.
