B00J0UXHTM|4|Let's start with the positives. The material is very, very soft and comfortable. It is also very warm. It feels like a nice fleece blanket. It's loose, but then again I did order a large as I normally wear medium sizes. This is because other customers reported to have had it be to small for them. It's still quite wearable, of course. Just a bit on the baggier side. The hood is very roomy as well. It's also very cute.<br />  I ordered the skeleton and was pleased as it was mostly like it appeared in the picture. The operative word here is &#34;mostly&#34;. This is where I begin to go into the negatives. With the particular one I got, there were only four sets of ribs while the one in the picture had five. Not all that bad, but I just find it a bit odd. However it does leave a bit of an empty space between the top rib and the hood. The one I got had black buttons rather than white as shown in the picture. Also beware that the buttons are a bit far apart and may show a bit of skin if you aren't wearing anything underneath. These issues are rather insignificant compared to my main problems with the product. The stitching is not too good. In fact, one of the bones had nearly fallen off almost right after I took it out of the package (A simple clear plastic bag inside a white opaque bag for shipping, if anyone was interested.). It wasn't too much of an issue as I had my sewing kit handy, but this may be a problem for those without this kind of experience.<br /><br />Tl;dr version: Cute and comfy, but beware bad stitching. Keep a needle and thread or your favorite seamstress nearby just in case.<br /><br />Edit: There's also a zipper around the butt area so you don't have to unbutton the whole thing to go to the bathroom. Quite clever, really.
B003ZW6JKK|4|I returned them and requested that they be exchanged for large.  I have not heard from the company as to whether they will be exchanged or not but the shorts are good quality.
B0047W5J3K|5|I love it.It fits so good and has alil room in it so its not too constriciting..I got it as a gift And thanked the person many times.Its a beautiful piece of lingerie highly recommended
B00OBGOLL8|5|Husband had been looking for these in the store- glad I found them he got rid of all his others  and is happy I replaced his older ones
B00CBWY9C0|4|Thank you!
B00GK4VA22|5|I got to wear when I'm out with my daughter. She is horrified ;) but I think deep down she loves it.
B00OQVJU7S|5|Very good product. Arrived on time . Excellent quality
B007VU0DAO|5|It was a gift to my fiance and she really likes it. Hasn't had it long yet, but she likes the look & the comfort. Very nice robe.
B006ZSUJSE|3|Size was rather to big for me even in a small.<br />I also wanted a red red.... tomato red and this is much darker<br />and almost a maroon as it doesn't appear that way in the photo?<br />I also was hoping it was more like the James Dean jacket in Rebel without a cause.<br />That is truly what i am looking for. The style is similar but not exact.
B0055LGRVK|1|you will do better just wetting a standard bandana and using it, these have so little cooling agent in them it is laughable.
B00G28IWYK|5|I am very pleased with the socks. They fit perfectly, and are a good quality of cotton. They are very comfortable and I will definitely be ordering several more pairs. They are perfect for aligning your toes and preventing the friction between toes that can cause corns. I will definitely recommend them to friends.
B00K2ISD1I|4|I have love/hate relationship with those.I am 5'10 tall.They are long enough for me,thats a plus.They are really thin.Color  is great( i got them in indigo),but it stains.I love the fact they are made in USA,but expected a better quality for the price.I also like that they are high-waisted.Dont forget they are teenage sizes,so i wear size 8,i got them in 11,fit perfect.
B00574M9R6|1|order size 12-14. way too small. my daughter now wears them for her part time job
B004K30HJC|5|Ordered these for my mother and she was thrilled!  Comfortable and durable.  She will get them again and again!
B00DSDWDME|3|i bought a Large as i am a size 10 but in the waist it isn't snug, I still have alot of fabric in the back area above my waist. I don't think it is sewn as tapered to fit. but i guess its ok for what it is. just looks/fits like a normal t-shirt dress
B000OPI0OO|1|In the last package of Hanes bikinis I got, 2 of the undies were badly stitched, basically had an opening in the side stitching. Terrible quality!
B008PDPY3M|5|Looks just like it does in the picture. It's just like your typical snapback. It arrived on time....not much else to say aside from it's good quality including the stitching on the front.
B002WIFXNC|4|I love this tie.<br /><br />It is beautiful and I have received a lot of compliments on it.<br /><br />It is elegant and has range to wear with a nice suit or with jeans and a sports jacket.<br /><br />I recommend to order more than ONE tie at a time from this company as they charge quite a bit for shipping---STANDARD-price, so more than one tie might be more expensive, but the shipping for all the ties shipped together will save money; if that makes sense?<br /><br />I am happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Good quality and wonderful to wear.
B005F0WHFG|5|Shipped extremely fast!!! My husband loved organizing his pins in this!
B0091KDW1Y|2|This item didn't look as described.  It was very &#34;costumey&#34; and was of poor quality.  It took forever to fluff it up and there were still a lot of empty patches of no hair.  It looked like a bozo wig, lol.  But it would be good for a gag gift or cheap costume I suppose.  I was looking for a fun higher quality wig to wear to an event.
B00UIMIA8E|3|Looks good but it's kind of Wal-Mart/mid-America sized. I'm a solid medium in nearly every brand but this medium was enormous.  Reminded me of the last time I bought something at Wal-mart. The &#34;slim fit&#34; description could not be more off the mark.
B00DXWKW2I|4|The wig itself is exactly the color as shown in the photo.  The fibers are thick, and once the pre-made bun is taken down, one can see that the pre-made bangs, way too thick for this cosplay, can easily be brought back into the bun when restyled.  Being a new cosplayer, I didn't take the bun out before trying it on, so the inside cap seemed way too small.  Take the bun out.  The cap fits nicely, and isn't too big. Plus, it showed up earlier than I thought it would.  My only complaint would be the black wig cap that comes with it is cheap and not worth using.  It's just going to be saved for if mine ends up breaking.
B00I5M90HE|4|These are the FIRST white jeans I have ever owned. They fit really well. They are very low cut- zipper is about 3 inches long. Which for me, is perfect. You don't want to wear colored underwear. They are not sheer but white jeans call for neutral bloomers.
B00GKAB2BU|1|I had purchased this exact dress by Tiana B a few months ago in a size 12.  It was too big for me, but size 10 wasn't available.  I happened to look a few weeks ago at this dress and size 10 was available.  I was very excited as it is a very pretty dress.  After I received it I tried it on, only to notice that the Tiana B tag was no longer on the dress, but rather a Christin tag that was sewn in it's place.  I have never heard of this designer and I am disappointed that someone would do this to a dress.
B00BWV78HE|3|had to return
B001DLDOKI|3|It doesn't do all that much for firming up a belly.  I think I lost about 3/4 of an inch to one inch around the waist, as some tight pants fit looser now.  i was hoping for a bit more.  Don't do anything strenuous in this shirt tho, as it does tend to interfere with faster breathing, and makes you feel out of breath.
B00HA5H7BI|4|These slacks arrived promptly.  They were of excellent quality but not proportioned for my shape.
B007KE3DFS|5|So cute and well made.  Nice large size for a coin purse.  Great little conversation piece too.  Easy to wipe clean if needed.
B00MUUZ4U4|4|Beautiful piece, somewhat small try going two sizes bigger. After playing and adjusting it I made it work out.
B009XPNEQU|1|The picture isn't what it actually looks like. It is made of low quality material. I don't ever wear it.
B008MMBI5E|4|The belt is very pretty but it does run a bit small though. I wanted to be able to wear it over sweaters as well and it is a bit tight for that.
B007SB3LLO|5|I have purchased these socks in the past at a local retailer.. I was unable to find them in this color package..I didn't think the color would matter that much but I do like the fit, thickness and color of these socks!
B00FOSEUIQ|3|These socks do not fit tight enough and slip off my heels.  I have size 11 feet, but my feet are thin.  Good quality socks, though.
B0027UB9U6|3|Its a good wig.  hair strands fall out so be gentle when grooming it.
B00DRB4KRI|4|I needed brown pants that were easy to travel with and could be worn casual or at work. These fit the bill. I wore with heels and a drapey blouse to work, and converted to flats and tee afterward. Fit as expected for size 6 JNY (measurements approximately 30 = waist; 37 = hip/unstretched).
B005CSOIPS|5|Pants fit as I expected, got the XXL because I like my sweats a bit baggy & roomy. Great bang for the buck
B00ANUKVY2|3|Need to exchange i order for kids size m..didn't know that was for adult. How mi going to exchange this?
B00535EZ1W|5|Great hat with excellent sun protection.
B000LGJAFO|5|This gown is so<br />Comfortable and sexy at the same time. The robe is really nice with it and gives you enough coverage that if someone saw you it is ok
B0010AXAFG|4|I ordered the largest size available, XL. After one wash, it was a slim L size. It'll work as my first layer when I ski, but it's too snug as an outer shirt. I checked the Jockey site and they've stopped making the XXL size. A little irritating to finally find a good mock T-shirt, but not in your size. If you wear a Large, and you're slim, the XL should be fine. If you're a medium size, order the Large size. I have a 46 inch chest and the XL size is usually fine for me, but after one wash in cold water, it's more suitable for a size 42 inch chest.
B0046EHFWM|3|Outfit seems a little uncomfortable and the upper seem started coming undone. Otherwise it is great looking and reasonably priced
B00Y9LE8GS|4|Good fit as expected.
B0037J0TPC|4|I love the military style belts. I like to be able to adjust them without having to drill new holes like a leather belt. The belt itself seems very durable but the buckle seems a little cheap. The metal seems thin. I have been wearing it for over a week now and is still holding up great. I hope to continue wearing it for a long time. If it does break or go bad, I will definitely update this review.
B007AK50M6|1|After reading other reviews about the off sizing, I thought I had guessed right in ordering a size that should work for my kids. However, they were WAY too big.  I will be returning them.  Also, the other reviews I read didn't mention the fabric: they are made out of paper-like material (I wouldn't call it fabric!)... not at all what I was hoping for.
B00OZLTG2S|1|Ok yo
B00LAU1GSY|5|Love Love Love these - they are true to size and are very flattering... got asked if I had lost weight more than once the first time I wore them! and I love the positive affirmations in the lining!!
B004SOTRQM|5|This robe is a perfect weight for the summer months we have in Texas.  It washed very nicelyalso.  Just a great robe.
B00JGAZ0QY|5|High quality super comfey work out shorts.
B005GE4JIE|3|Wouldn't return only exchanged. I ended up with two now. It's cute but yes runs very small.
B000Z3UQ24|5|I've been purchasing these Aura jeans for over 7 years and still feel they are the best fitting jeans for my body (5'6&quot; 125 lbs.) - slimming, but not tight.  However, they do run a bit large and since I recently lost a few pounds I had to exchange the 8 for a 6.  I will continue to wear these jeans as long as Wrangler makes them and thank you Amazon for keeping them in stock and having a very easy return/exchange policy !
B00E9UTI9G|5|After reading other reviews I was initially afraid that these would be tighter than I was expecting, and indeed they are when you first put them on. However, similar to jeans fresh out of the dryer, these loosen a bit with wear and fit exactly as expected after about five minutes of wearing them, and stay like that for the rest of the day! Would definitely buy again.
B001CT12PK|3|I ordered these a 1/2 size bigger then I usually wear and they still fit tight. After two months the sole is already starting to seperate from the shoe.
B00E6FEEES|3|MAN ONBD GOT DIS SHIT IT FIT DOE ONBD
B00GS18WMI|5|Hilarious!
B00GH0USHW|5|Had looked everywhere for lace footless tights to wear over red leggings. Finally found what I needed on Amazon. Oh yes! They really can make your outfit pop! I would recommend these for sure. Great fit and good price.
B00ISBH1PK|1|I ordered these due to the comments from prior customers.  I have a larger mid section but still wear a size 10/12 and decide to give these a try.  I cant wear them, they are so tight and so not true to size.  I ordered a large and still way to small. I did not try them on until I was going to need them for a trip and now cant even return them as I guess you needed to do this before a certain time frame and I was not aware of that, guess I will have to donate them to good will now.
B0098YMXF4|1|Upon first wash product fell apart.
B00G28T7IA|5|I have fit flops which are wonderful for my legs and back. I wear these socks  in the colder months with them. They stop your foot from sliding around and keep my feet warm.  Love these socks.
B001SAV8BQ|2|This swimsuit is nothing at all like the picture - not even close. The swimsuit itself is not at all supportive in the bust, and the panties that come with it are HUGE - they come up several inches above the belly button. It seems matronly and nothing like the pretty picture that accompanies it on this site. I'm returning mine.
B00J2WJY9K|1|Smells bad so I just can't use it.
B008G7ISH6|5|Beautiful цевет<br />pleasant material.<br />comfortably and conveniently to the head<br />It is happy with a choice.<br />I recommend. you awake are happy
B0036E8VRQ|5|I ordered this dress for my senior prom. Im 5'5 120lbs 34c, I ordered the small and it was way to big. I had to have it taken in about an 1.5 inches on each side, the strap shortened, and about 6 inches taken off the bottom. I should have gone with an xsmall. But i had the alterations done and it fit wonderful after that. I had so many comliments on the dress style..all in all Beautiful dress, great price.
B00B4ELQMM|5|These leggings fit perfectly! I'm 5'3, 122lb and I bought the small. They aren't see through which is super.<br />Very happy with my purchase.
B003FSSPC4|5|Fits well.  Fun for Halloween.
B001ELL6EI|2|WAY too small. Cut into my back.
B004WOWUH6|4|These are great to keep in the glove box of your car! I hate wearing the paper flip flop the salon provides!
B00EDOQZF8|2|Ridiculously small. I usually wear a M-L but ordered the XL and it's still very tight! I ordered another Rip Curl bottom with similar issues. I won't be ordering this brand again - will stick with Roxy and Billabong, surf brands that seem to get that most women have curves!
B003OQTQ34|5|Got this for my man, he needed something slender, but enough to fit a few cards and cash.  Worked perfectly.
B003XCGZVU|5|I didn't have high expectations because I thought the price was very low, so I planned on wearing it as a swimsuit cover-up for our winter beach vacation. To my surprise, the fabric is very soft and the dress can actually be dressed up with a cute jacket. I definitely plan to buy one in green and blue. I think you'll be surprised how soft the material is! Also, I am tall, 5'9 and was please at the length. I am skinny and I wear a size 8, I ordered a Large and it fit me perfectly. If you are on the shorter side, you will have to wear a heeled sandal in order to keep from it covering up your toes. I would guess that a Small or a Medium would provide you with shorter length perhaps. I'm very glad that I purchased this dress and I was surprised with how speedy the shipping is!
B007KG3NTC|5|These pants are a fine product and live up to the advertised claim of being the most comfortable that I have ever worn. I will be a repeat customer.... Dont ever stop making these pants ... the best ever
B002XULNKQ|3|I bought a size bigger than I normally would, based on comments from other reviewers. I am 5'8&#34; and weigh 140 lbs and I bought the XL. The large would have been ok. They are a little big around the seat (I have a flat backside) and a snug fit around the legs. I'm not sure if the smaller size would be too tight around the legs. Because they will be under a dress I am not that worried that they don't fit tight around my backside. I bought them to wear under my latin dress that doesn't have built in underwear. The dress doesn't come up too much when I turn, I just wanted them because the dress has a shear, very short skirt with fringe overlay and I wanted it to look like there is a skirt!<br /><br />My recommendation is don't buy a size up.
B00BSEAQJ2|4|They undies pictured are white, but they come in assorted colors. Other than that, I have been happy with my purchase.
B0000WL7I2|5|My husband said the lining in these bibs are thicker then the brown bibs and the outside as well.
B00GYQYYUQ|3|Although the size was correct when received, the shape/style of these pants simply don't work on my body. They barely fit over my butt and had lots of excess fabric in front. They also didn't fall below the knee like they do in the photos; they reached only to the midpoint of my kneecap. If you have a particularly curvy behind or long legs, don't buy these - they won't fit right.
B00EPONH16|5|very soft and well made, son loved it!
B008ENQTUK|5|Love these socks.  Extremely high quality.<br />Wish there were more exciting colors offered, though.<br />These are very tasteful ... sometimes we want to be loud!  We're two years old!
B00871DPJW|5|the material is soft - the skirt has the little shorts under it...I mean really...could it be any cuter. this is a great spring/summer outfit and it washes really well
B008G3NZJQ|5|Shirt is exactly what I thought it should be.  For the price, the quality is good and colors are clear.  Would order again from this company.
B00LI5LL7W|4|It fit my wife more snug that her regular medium shirts, but overall it does look good.
B004M6XUI2|5|just as it is shown----very satisified with it
B0076R6MFM|5|The price is right, very good!
B0096NH8L6|4|Great quality. Sizes run a little larger, but you still have a hidden rope around the waist to make it smaller.
B008FB9XOA|5|These are well made sturdy shorts. I bought them as a gift, but had to return them because the person I bought them for did not want to be wearing or sitting on the American flag.
B004TVQDRA|1|I normally love Maidenform bras, but I hate hate hate this one!  I also hate the Maidenform the Dream t-shirt bra.  My normal size in every bra I've ever owned, including multiple Maidenform bras, is 34A.  I actually received the Dream bras when I was exchanging 2 I ordered and didn't like, and was given this as a substitute.  They are sooo small in cup and band size.  I haven't gained weight.  All my other bras I own fit perfectly as always, but my Dream bras are sooo incredibly small, which make them very uncomfortable and unflattering.  I only kept them because I didn't want to pay to ship back to the company for the second time to exchange them, but I'm really unhappy with both of them.  I can't recommend this style because I'm not sure your regular size will fit, unfortunately.
B00C7SNKN2|5|I have 2 pairs of these jeans)<br />I like them, only hope they will have light blue colour of this model also.
B011DKP2RQ|5|Cutest skirt ever!!!  I have almost all the colors. Coming back for more.  Super comfy and true to size.  The fabric is fantastic!!!  This skirt can be dressed up or down.  I love it!!!
B004ZJVQIM|2|This jacket is just as cute on as in the picture and does not show dirt easily, but the sleeves run a little short and that leaves no growing room at all. However, my child can be hard to fit at 5' and 85lbs. Some kids jackets that are long enough are too wide, and ones like this 14/16 fits well, but is a little too short.  Oh, the pocket has a hole in it already and the sleeve is starting to tatter.
B0041OX2RY|3|Was an excellent value until:<br /><br />1. The first key fell out after 4 months of use.  Problem was due to that one grid of the metal grid that holds the keyrings to the leather widened; thus, the keyring fell out.  Extremely difficult to repair.  Higher quality grid needed.<br /><br />2. Of all the keyrings I've had to force-insert keys into, this is far the most difficult.  Ouch.  I would still rate case 5 star, if it wasn't for #1.
B003B2O8HK|5|I wore this wig all day at school (I'm a teacher-- so 8-4 pm), and it was great! I was Annabeth Chase, from the Percy Jackson series, and with my orange camp halfblood teeshirt, I looked the part! Thanks for great service and a great product!
B009TAJSO6|5|The color was great and the material was very soft and cuddly.  It was a very good buy for the price definitely.
B00L59HSQO|3|Top lace requires Small dart alteration necessary for proper fit
B00FKNPCKA|5|Very soft, got it  in mocha, would get one in every color.
B005SVILLQ|5|Great buy
B007ZH8FBW|2|Very poor quality.  Made in china. Could not even read the Nocona stamp inside.<br />I've bought better  craftsmanship  at the flee market. At least leather from Usa.
B00AYVLBBM|5|Excellent quality, very comfortable and the size is perfect
B00H5D7O7M|5|This is the best headband!  I love it because it is covered, so it's really comfortable.  We dressed up for Halloween at work and I was able to wear it in comfort all day and leave it on for the evening trick or treat group!  Not to mention, it is adorable!!!!
B002X359V2|5|Love the shirt, the design is printed very nicely and it fits pretty well. Shirt construction is sturdy as well.
B002HG9I9O|5|nothing flimsy about these buttons. uncle sam would approve of them. buy a hundred— find 20 friends to share with.
B0069TE40S|5|Great.
B0071AI0MM|4|This dress (and one more ordered form this vendor) are NOT true to size..I would say you need to order 2 sizes up than what you really are...
B008N812S0|5|Nice socks.  Come all the way to the knee. Comfortable fabric - doesn't itch.  Pretty warm.  Good neutral color - charcoal gray.  Slim smooth fit but not that awful thin stretchy fabric of &#34;trouser socks&#34;.  I'm happy - would recommend.
B00BR3ZF86|5|she likes
B003ODIO08|5|This wig worked very well with the costume. Only wished is came with the ears which we had to add in.
B00N72VIPY|2|Does not fit true to size. I ordered a medium which is normally my size but it is way too small. I suggest buying 2 sizes up from what you would normally wear.
B00KC37698|5|Nice and soft 100% cotton, nice medium gauge knit with just enough stretch. However, I DONOT dry them in the dryer. Love'em!!
B00389ZH2G|5|Great fit, soft fabric, super comfortable, high quality product! I only wish there were more variety in colors to choose from!
B00IU06WTU|4|Great deal for these if you have skinny ties and want lots of of color options. I've been wearing them at least a few times per week.<br /><br />They can still work for fatter ties but they will be kind of tiny and the tie will flap more than you want.<br /><br />I couldn't go all the way to 5 stars because the back part of the bracket isn't flat like more expensive clips, If I could I would go 4.5 stars... but I knew that going in so they are still great!
B0007CKMOA|5|Excellent pair of jeans, bought from amazon because I am a hard to find size.  Jeans are comfy, don't shrink in the wash, and hold up well over time.
B005CSNWKK|3|FYI - these are not the same cut/fit as Champion C9 from Target. The quality seems good, but I returned these because they were larger than I expected.
B004CO4C72|3|I bought the XL and they fit as expected.  I have 47 inch hips and fit smooth, no cutting and zero feeling of tightness.<br /><br />They do not sit on my thighs as the product image shows (as of this writing they seem to sit about 1/2 inch or so down the thigh).  Of course that is due to my legs that are thicker than this model's. :-) But it does not matter as they feel great.<br /><br />Under tight Skinny jeans I sometimes have to move the material around the thigh a bit, but it is not terrible. It rides on the waist like in the sales image but can easily be stretched higher.<br /><br />These are very lightweight and I really love how they feel.<br /><br />Why the 3 stars you ask?  Because after washing them (front load washer, cold water, normal wash) the stitching around the waist came out of all four pairs and wrapped themselves around the other garments.  After about the 4th wash, there is now pilling around the bum/crotch area as well.  I just rechecked the wash instructions on the them, it does not say to hand/gentle wash.  I do tumble dry on Low heat.  I Don't have this issue with other brands of panties.
B00A2OHRTQ|5|Great shirt! Accurate color. Good fit and good material. Would definitely buy this again!
B00M2OXHK2|4|A very slightly-tapered (but not slim fit) shirt which provides a comfortable fit while providing flattering lines. The shirt's colors are much more vivid than pictured. I received compliments from three different people the first time I wore this shirt and one &#34;wow, that'd be great for St. Patrick's day!&#34; The only thing that bothers me is the Rocawear brand tag on the back of the shirt.
B001JBF7UM|5|Good product and a good deal.it fit just fine. Fast delivery on time they are longer than what i expected considering they were not tall
B002LITBDQ|3|This product would be better if it were designed smaller or gave some size chart with an indication of what size to order for your body size. I usually wear medium, so given no other information I ordered medium. It is comfortable and pretty, but way to loose. I wish I had ordered small, then it may have been more useful for a comfortable lounge bra. As it is it is loose and offers no support, because it is too big.
B0091UYDFS|5|Fast delivery and perfect for the event I had
B00VFYKLCW|1|haha waste of time. I'm 5'3, 120 lbs, got a large since it ran small and it's so small i could probably use it as a shirt but the chest is too big.  very unflattering, very disappointed, i was really excited about this dress too. It's not as blue as the picture either, ladies don't do it. shipping it back.
B00JRW3F1I|3|The top fit ok but the length is not good need to be taller
B00997L5Q8|1|It was ripped and there was no time for a replacement
B00BIPVBYA|4|My 10 year old has size 8 feet. She has a hard time finding shoes that fit her for a decent price. These are high quality and work well for what she needs them for. They shipped the shoes super fast. I think we received them within 2-3 days of placing the order and that was with regular shipping. Thank you.
B00EILVXCQ|4|I bought this for my husband. I purchased the xl, which is what he normally wears. For the most part, the shirt fit fine. His only complaint was that the sleeves were a little snug, for an xl.
B0030IU8RE|5|This pants are true to size so order what you usually wear.  Material is stiff at first but gets softer after a few washes.
B00EVM05MG|3|The waist is fine, just what I needed but I find the shorts too baggy and a little too long. I have other size 34 shorts from another manufacturer which fit and look much better.
B004O2H4IQ|4|The shirt is really nice. I have had Doberman's all my life and this shirt looks like one of my current females, right down to the personal weapons. I would have liked it even more if it had been solid black instead of the marbleized pattern.
B003CT9IM2|3|Nice piece except that when I read the reviews, most said said a size small. I wear a 2XL so I thought Id order a 4XL. When it came, it was marked as a 4XL, but no way, I could barely fit it. So if you order, order three sizes to big I guess. But overall, it is a good item
B003DBAAXA|5|I feel so comfortable and best during hot weather.  It is best for anyone who don't mind wears any time or just during hot summer like as I do.  It is nice to wear.
B002C60VEK|5|These were nicer than what I was expecting.  They arrived quickly and in great shape.  I was pleasantly surprised.
B00HLW4VGE|3|set up return of too large pajamas<br /><br />ordered smaller size<br /><br />smaller size arrived<br /><br />large still waiting for UPS to arrive with pick up return label  (2 WEEKS WAITING)
B007KFZ9TA|5|Very happy.  Great quality! I would buy this product again.  It is very comfortable and not binding.  The blue is so pretty!
B009YPWZPU|5|needed a long shirt to cover the plumbers cleavage.  this works great!
B00P0NFHLY|5|I like it because it has many pockets and it is very durable!
B00FO786SW|1|Despite the website description that &#34; And since this is a Skedouche brand sweater, you know you are receiving a quality, well-made product that will last you for years!&#34; this is a terribly made product.  The knit is loose, the interior stitching will snag on anything, and I can't imagine it lasting for more than one wearing without stretching out and having pulled threads everywhere.  I didn't even wear it to the party I was planning on using it for due to the poor quality.  Returning it immediately.
B007EDOXBI|5|This is a very slimming and retro bathing suit that will look great on any figures. I'm a mother of two 28 yrs old and it makes me feel like Bettie Page.Now all I need is long pin-up girl hair and red lipstick and red high heels. The only thing I didnt like when buying was the sizing chart makes you feel like a cow a size 14 is classified as a xxl which makes you kind of bummed because thats not what you want to see For swim suit season.lol. But other than that great buy top and bottom for twenty dollars cant beat that and adjustable straps with padding that gives you a round firm lift for your breast.Buy It You Know You Want To.<br />Meg
B004YZZKSO|4|I'm a 22, 250, 5'3\\". This is a little snug, but seriously...I am happy with this Queen Size. Of course I bought this for \\"play time\\" and it does the job. Cute and sexy. A+!
B00G2JLX68|2|Didn't get the black cargoes yet but I'm gonna need an xxl
B00OV7Y86U|5|Great shorts. Fits perfectly
B000NIEBZ4|4|I was given their nursing bra nightgown as a baby shower gift.  I thought it would actually be perfect since I'm small and Im always drowning in the hospital gowns.  I wore it during my stay in the hospital and I loved it since when I had visitors I wasn't completely exposing myself.  I did buy the nursing bra tank to wear home, but wore the gown for the first couple of week.      The tanks are so well constructed inside & out, there are 4 unique layers to the lining - tank layer (outside) - mesh liner to hold your nursing pad, another layer which has the cut out to give access to feed then back layer of the tank.  It gives substanial suupport, like the style name it's a nursing bra tank, not a BRA!  Don't expect the same quality of support, but that for a bra tank its great support.     If you are in between sizes I recommend going up a size, but other than that the sizing it pretty good. Not to say you can't nurse without them, but they definitely prolonged my breastfeeding experience which was great.
B00PU0QN2Y|1|The whole shirt fit, except the sleeves were super tight, could'nt get it on my arms
B00LXLXWBO|4|I look good in it
B002DTZKTM|5|Quality shirt.  Fits as described.  Shipped when promised. Soft comfortable fabric with a subtle but dark print giving a modern twist this great band's basic rock roots.
B00CC11EP0|2|It is more like a neck scarf than a hijab.
B00NIN2IQK|5|So cute and so soft/comfy!!
B000QWDQR6|5|My daughter recommmended         My daughter had tummy tuck surgery , and the doctor recomended it. so she has been using it for about 6month and loving it.she told me to get it , and i love it. i believe i have lost couple of inches. i use it for about 8 hrs or more , specially when i go for my morning walks ,about 2hrs, help me to sweat a lot.i am very happy.                   it
B005FPMT7M|5|But it for my 7 months old baby.<br />its cute and I can match colors depending on his outfit when he goes out/
B0089FBX2W|4|This is sort of a hybrid and works for a swimsuit or shorts.  It's not wildly stylish for either but if you are traveling and only want to take one item to do double duty this is the one. Dries fast too.  My husband had another pair before we bought these and literally wore it out after years of use.  I think he said the inner liner finally gave out. That pair was black and also looked faded after long use.<br /><br />This one seems a bit more streamlined than the last but since he is slim that's fine with us.  It is still a loose comfortable short but definitely not as baggy as before so is, in fact, a better fit.
B006WFG6YQ|5|Very nice, slim-tailored feel shirt! I Love how the Doublju Shirts fit snugly, yet still allows a fair range of motion and a slight stretch through the armpit and chest area. Well constructed, worn and washed many times during the last 6 months, still in great condition, highly recommended!<br /><br />Ordered: M (US Small) 12/9/11
B009RX5GVY|5|All bras are designed for support but some fit better 'your doctor's apts', some are 'for your boyfriend', and some are for your own convenience. This one fits the later purpose the best. And it's exceptionally good for a big-breasted, not particularly young women after breast-feeding at least one child. It's my long time favorite: it makes me look good and feel great! What else is needed? I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!<br />As to shipping, it was prompt and exactly as promised.
B00877606Q|5|...but I will be reordering these in a larger size soon.  They tend to run a tad bit small in the waist.  Don't let my experience discourage you from buying these shorts.  The garment I received appeared to be extremely well constructed of a rugged fabric, and they look great.
B00ADJE3ZG|5|Great shirt-Son loves it for swimming. Good quality!
B00Q8VBC2A|1|Too flimsy
B003H2L75U|4|I would have given it a 5 start but it was a bit small and when I rode it on my bike it didn't spin as much as I thought it should.  Otherwise a great novelty item and a way to make fun of yourself in a good way.
B005CSOS9O|5|Very nice
B00BXTQPS8|2|I received this hat as a christmas gift last year...and to this day still have the tags on it because it jus did not fit.if you have a big head as myself its def not the hat for you...it didn't even reach my ears. Made out of 100% wool that easily shrinks if not protected. The black part and the logo were on point with the colors, but the color on the yellow bill is def an off yellow as well(which was a bummer). My suggestions is to buy a New Era® 9fifty batman hat because they jus simply fit so much better!  Hopefully this is helpful enough=)
B000H8KR62|3|The color was a light khaki and close to the color of the movie.  My disappointment came in the actually quality of construction.  The seam allowance material was on the outside in areas.  The pack was nice but the gun portion was weak.  However, the costume was a smash.  Older folks and young alike really like the costume.  Great nostalgia quality.
B00M4X4K4I|5|great product. love the colors and it wears comfortably
B0036DEUHW|3|Love the Diesel jacket.....only thing I didn't like they run kinda  slim....had to return for an exchange......other than that ....everything was fine
B00LH12OY6|5|My 3 yr old wanted to sleep in these last night!  Loves the camo and so glad to finally find some gloves in his size!
B007WAG03C|4|Shirt was a small but was way too big. Overall shirt is nice though, will have it altered to fit.
B00EJZELI4|2|Being 6.5months pregnant, this was way too large.  NOt only the length but where the arms are was too loose to show your bra.<br />will not recommend if you are size small.
B0073LT5I2|5|I bought this as a gift for a friend and, I have to say... she loves it!  She's a big Alice in Wonderland fan and it's perfect.  It's different than the typical themed gift.<br /><br />The clock works well... and... in fact... whenever I see her she says, &#34;ask me what time it is!&#34; just so she can open it up and tell me.<br /><br />The chain is nice and long - which I didn't know it would be but I love!
B0007YR9H6|2|Yes the straps are comfortable and it has decent support but the bra itself is so rough underneath my breasts as well as my entire midsection that it leaves marks and literally hurts. If you loosen it to the last hook setting then it's not worth wearing.    Don't buy. Seriously.
B00E1LAOGE|1|Bad size info, the size 12 to 14 is a regular M or S
B0098YM156|5|Son danced alot at wedding where he was ring bearer.  Glad we got one with some cotton so that he might be more comfortable.  He tends to run warm so I didn't want him getting uncomfortable, messy looking or sweaty on cold night.  Maybe the cotton helped with that.  Hard to find all cotton, but maybe easier to keep pressed looking if not 100% cotton.<br /><br />We paired with black suspenders and the wedding color purple bowtie and a purple cummerbund and looked pretty wonderful.<br /><br />Sizing:  He is a tall, slim 4 1/2 year old wears size 4 shirts in Gymboree and the 4 fit him perfectly sleeve length just great.<br /><br />Enjoy your event!
B003UM41DM|5|I ordered this for my son for christmas because he plays soccer and loves Beckham. He thinks its just awesome, now all he needs is some warm weather to wear it!!
B004PBG36A|4|This a little big, not a great choice for micro preemies. But even though God decided to bring him home being able to provide him with this small blessing meant so much. Finding preemie clothes is very hard, Thanks Jacqui
B0018OPL7O|4|Good fit, sturdy, makes for comfortable and stylish work jeans. The price of jeans are too high! But worth your money.
B00DKWLSSI|5|This is a great backpack. It is large enough to hold all the essentials. It seems to be well made and I think it will withstand the entire school year. The little zipper pouch on the outside is clear plastic with the trashies painted it on to it which I think is a unique touch. There are black mesh pouches on the side. The straps are padded and adjust well. My son loves the fact that noone else in his grade has one like it, and all the other kids made a big fuss over him the first day he wore it to school. Overall this is a pretty sweet backpack.
B00T11YNUW|5|Wow. Fit perfect.
B004UUED5Y|1|broke when attempting to open to use the first time so we fixed it and it broke in a different spot i assume it will cost more to ship back then to just trash it<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!!!!
B00DV89Z0E|5|Happy
B00AFTO3P4|5|These little socks seem to be quite well made.  I bought them for a 10-month-old so his feet have to get a little bigger to fit right.  But they did seem to prevent him from slipping while he had them on.  They are cute little things too, trying to look like shoes.  They should fit perfect on a 12-month-old.
B00PC74FC0|2|Narrow through torso very long shirt. I couldn't size up because I'm nervous it would be even longer!
B00551OS70|5|This is a seriously awesome bra!! My tatas  haven't been this supported in the past decade. Even my husband notice the girls got a serious lift!!! Extremely comfortable  and stylish. I don't feel like I'm wearing a granny bra either. The girls are very happy!!!
B00I4U28VM|1|End up way too large.
B00K90TG9C|5|The color said red, but when I got it, it was a pink or coral color, but i love the way it fit and the look
B008MA186A|5|Perfect fit. Great feeling material.
B00CC41ZTM|5|This was a perfect transaction.  The hat is exactly as described.  I couldn't be more pleased.
B00PJ6TN80|5|good shirt
B003VKQMMQ|5|Nice, but the sizes run large
B00K08JK1M|5|Really great jacket. Totally enjoy wearing it!
B0026P46OS|5|I purchased these bras at a store and loved them.  After two plus years, I went searching and found them on Amazon!  Thank God - lowest price over the other online stores - fast delivery - and these bras and feminine and comfortable!  Don't stop making them Playtex!
B00CPSWBIY|5|Was so happy with the outfit ! More than I expected.Thanks! Will order more from  you. It was for my daughter she loves it.So does her friends
B004J6P2SQ|5|I bought this and the white San-X one for a friend. I was nervous at first because I wasn't sure of the size but I am 5'3 and this thing was perfect for me. It was a little big but not to the point where I was drowning in it. If you like the \\"snuggies\\" this is basically a version of that. It's very warm and soft and just fun to be in!
B00VFB0ECC|1|These are made very small
B004H8GIGQ|5|Best pants ever!!!!  My son is husky so it's really hard to find school pants that fit.  These pants fit perfectly!
B00BMW88SG|2|The earring came exactly as its displayed but It the loop was too small and doesnt stay on the ear well.
B00D1SX8PW|1|I have ordered this product before and it was great. But this time, I received 14 pairs of size 4 instead of 4 pairs of size 14.
B00NBNWG3M|1|The dress fit but because the dress is see through the silky underlining was way too short it was supposed to go down to your thighs and it stopped at my lower back ...total waste
B0012QMTAK|4|I am 5'2&#34; and it fit perfect. They aren't the best quality, but they will do for a costume. The lace is also a bit itchy. But overall good for the price.
B005EWDT48|5|This was a lovely jacket; good quality and nice looking. I'm sorry that I had to return it as it was not the jacket my granddaughter wanted. I would purchase again from this site. I got quick and efficient service. I had no problem returning the jacket - quick & easy.
B00MEB6ZZ2|5|Very nice
B00AHTK4VY|5|The bra is really amazing, but it run small. Is better buy a one size up. I return back mine and order a bigger size.
B0019CGH1Y|5|I love the Myself belts.  My daughter is very tall for her age and has to wear a belt with her school uniform.  These belts help her be independent and develop her skills.
B00LINYSCY|3|It's  thin
B003MZ0168|3|Nice bra with a better price than the $60 or so Wacoal minimizer with the embroidery, but the cup size seems to run a little smaller than the other minimizer(?).
B00LBGPW9G|5|thick
B00VUE6KEU|5|I foud this dress to be wonderful and very chic. I wear a size 8 and ordered a medium. The fabric was a bit itchy but after first washing and line dry it is great. Yes, the pockets are a bit low, but not too bad.
B00JGM8UQO|5|I've bought a number of cheap corsets online and I have not say that this is the only one that did not give me any trouble! Not only is it really nice, but very true to the picture and description. The only complain I have is that the back lacing is black (nothing else on the corset is black) and it looks like a giant shoelace string. I can't complain for the price!
B00076ZRIM|4|Great shirt feels good looks nice
B001YHIVZO|5|Product is made well and is very comfortable.  Great Gift to give the man in your life. Shipped quickly too!
B003HP8BOM|5|I am a large woman that normally wears a 2x-3x. I had to buy the 5x so it would fit me properly. I love it and got A LOT of compliments when I wore it.
B00GXD2B14|5|It fits perfect and it’s beautiful.  The lace has a lovely appearance and it fits nicely to your body with a little stretch, it's really soft and comfortable I’m really happy with my purchase
B001O8KRUA|3|The bandeau doesn't stretch that much, but the lace is nice. It covers the girls when you don't want to expose too much cleavage.
B00GSMIL6O|4|The inseam is pretty low, but it works well if your legs are bigger.
B005XXPHRU|3|Somewhat too small for a 2X.  I called myself ordering a size up from a 1X.  Will order 2 sizes up next time.  Prefer it to be too somewhat too big than somewhat too small.
B00QICDDLC|5|I've noticed in general I have to size up in this style of PJ no matter the brand. Son is a 2t in clothing and 3t in these PJS
B00HZ6FWG4|5|I love it but it fits a little small.  Buy a size up.
B008HTMHPC|4|Love this kit to go along with my panda costume. The headband fits a bit snug but the paws and tail are too cute this purchase came right on thursday before halloween I was very pleased with both purchases I made. Thanks so much!
B002KMJGLU|5|Perfect for trip don't take much room they look really nice.
B00SX515EY|5|Love this belt.  It does not matter if I ware it on my hips or my waist there is always the right holes to make it fit.
B00LDAW78E|5|Perfect
B00OBESJT0|4|This is a really good quality coat for the cost. It isn't the thickest, so I wouldn't recommend it as a winter coat, but as a jacket it's perfect. It looks really nice, fits great (I'm built pretty narrowly, if you have a wider frame this coat may not fit you as well), and actually is nicer-looking in person than in the photo. My only quibble is that the &#34;leather&#34; strap on the collar is super cheap material and will likely be damaged easily. However, this was expected and not a serious flaw; it still looks nice, and could be easily replaced with something more substantial by anyone with some know-how at the sewing machine. All in all, I would recommend this jacket and seller. P.S. It also arrived about two weeks earlier than the estimate. I don't know how typical that is, but I certainly was pretty pleased.
B007UXMQXO|5|Tags protect paper luggage tags given by Cruise Lines.
B00KIAT1SO|3|Beatiful dress! Just runs small. I bought it for my daughter who normally wears a size 6. I ordered an 8, but it just wouldn't zip up.  The beads tend to come loose very easily.
B009B8EE7W|1|As another reviewer noted, I was sent black and yellow cufflinks instead of the silver. The ones I received appeared to be sturdily constructed, but black juxtaposed with yellow appeared garish to me.
B00EK93XYW|5|I was not disappointed with this shirt in the least. I usually wear a medium so that's what I ordered and I am happy with the fit. It's not to tight and flows beautifully when you walk.
B000W8R57Q|1|This patch was smaller than expected and blurrier as well.  The stitching is not as clear as it is in the photo so it does not read well.  Very disappointed.
B000NV7FM2|1|Even thou the brand is good; these pants are as cheap as pay-less shoes...don't buy it.
B00DV0NR9M|3|I like this shirt. It's soft and comfortable. I will say the finger holes are on backwards. HaHa I thought the review I read before had to be crazy. Nope, it's backwards. It can still be worn, but it gets frustrating. Get it together Allegra
B004RFPN92|5|A++ service will definitely buy again! Little man can't stop wearing it especially since I customized it to have his name on it!
B00LP7ACSW|3|A little short for my all legs frame! I am 5'7&#34; but my legs are as long as my husbands 6'!  Also it is VERY thin!  Other than that I think it is nice!
B0093AXPG4|4|Really funny and well made,  looks really cute but it runs toooo large for my 3 months baby.
B003C41P8M|5|I am very impressed with the quality and fit of the Reef Men's Moving on Shorts.  If you are looking for a pair of nice shorts that wash well without shrinkage and wrinkling then I recommend this pair of shorts.  So happy with the quality and fit I purchased two more pairs of shorts in different colors for my son.
B00MDMTVN0|4|Looks good is great for just kicking around. Pleasantly surprised with this one and a great value. Ended up giving it to the other half as she liked it so much. Looking to order more!
B003XCN0A4|5|This shirt does the job it claims to do for a reasonable price. I wear it as my only top when riding my bicycle on a warm day, or under my jacket on a cooler day. With clothing items, I always appreciate when people include in their reviews information about sizing. I'm usually in between a medium and a large in shirts. I'm 5'11&#34; and 175 pounds, and this large fits well. I bought two of them in different colors.
B0087AZNNO|3|Doesn't come with side pockets
B003OQTUX0|5|Quality, great fit, Good looks, are the words I'm using to describe these pants. They lay well and feel good when moving in them. When washing, try hanging to dry. This will definitely prolong life.  I'm slim and well....these fit well, highly recommended~
B0058YH6I2|5|very good and excellent quality, the jacket is resistant to water and very resistant beautiful colors, is of good quality
B004WSD7VK|4|great for the price compared to store prices i bought several of these and plan to buy some more , can't beat the price
B00CNCO5NQ|5|She liked it, it fit well
B00HZ2VF5K|5|Good fit - good quality…very happy - thank you!
B004LEUVY6|5|It is much more durable then i thought it would be. I freaking love this thing it turns heads where ever i go haha.
B006Z5U3RY|5|Very, very nice and cheap shirts. I've bought for my son, for every day. He is 7 years old, he likes this shirt
B007V4W7SQ|4|I really like this top, however I was a little disappointed, it doesn't look exactly as the picture.  The style is the same, but the shape in the picture is more fitted to the body, the actual shape is fuller and more of a relaxed fit.  It is slimming, and does give a very nice appearance with taylored pants. I am happy with this purchase and would buy it another color if it would be available?
B00JUMFRKM|1|Pre-washed it before wearing.  Lots of lint.  Washed second time, again lots of lint released.  It is no fun to wear it with lots of lint sticking to my body, on the floor, and everywhere I go.  Returned it.  Amazon credited my account the moment I dropped off the returned hoodie at UPS.
B00CE91UYK|1|I am not happy with product size.  The material is ok, however it is very thin.  This would be an ok shirt if it were larger.
B00NBQ6CHU|5|This is so adorable! The photo does not do it justice.
B00P8DZE8C|4|Absolutely Love Huf socks! These the real deal,no knock off brand or any of that nonsense. Definitely will be buying more.
B002W4Z8EU|2|These pants run VERY small. My nine month old was in the 50 percentile for height and weight and she was WAY too big for the 6-12 month pants. I don't think they make this color in 12-18 months, though.
B0076OF4N6|5|My husband works out in the elements every day.  This jacket blocks the wind and helps to keep him dry.  He puts a sweat jacket underneath for extra warmth.  He would highly recommend this jacket to anyone who works outside.
B007K99YXS|1|They send wrong size and color. I´m  out the states so return it´s not that easy, so I really hate that kind of mistakes.
B00091SRXW|5|Stop making fun of my red dickeys! These are my fancy , casino going to, all you can eat buffet, Big Pimpin  pants.
B00ECBP2MY|5|Cute top, goes with everything. Fits as described
B008QA4TM6|4|I haven't had it that long and its been raining so not sure yet has to how it will hold up with a lot of use seem like it will
B00MBFGR0Y|5|Excellent value, comfy, supportive and stylish.
B007OWI7ZC|3|The gloves were smaller than I anticipated, it felt like I was wearing children's gloves. Also there was a large, uncomfortable tag inside the right glove, when removed it, the seam tore leaving a hole of about an inch and a half.<br /><br />The gloves served their purpose for me, as I was just wearing them for a single use costume at a party. And they were inexpensive, so it all ended up okay. If you're looking for something durable, I wouldn't get these, but if you're looking for something disposable, they're a great buy!
B00F1AL62U|5|my girlfriend loves it!
B001D50GAA|5|very pleased, priced right!!!
B00QGR7QSK|4|Beautiful Shirt.  Would order a size up next time but I am keeping this one to wear under layers.  Too tight...shows all my lumps and bumps.  Needed a size up.
B00CU88T4E|5|Thank you!
B00J2R2B7W|5|Great durable pair of jeans
B0093DSF5W|5|My wife loves them that's all I care about.
B0046MCQR8|1|I recently ordered the Del Rossa Classic Long Satin Lounge Robe. While my husband was well within the measurements listed for the size ordered, the robe was NOT. It was very skimpy indeed. This style should have had a good overlap and comfortable fit. The only thing that was generous was the length which would be good for a professional basketball player!!<br /><br />I returned the merchandise and am very disappointed. Won't order on line from this vendor again.
B00422M6FY|5|good
B002GP8V1M|5|I love this tie, it looks exactly like it does in the picture (rare) and is long enough (always go with XL if you're tall).
B0062A57N2|5|Great Costume, the child love it!
B005UO173U|5|ok
B00NRATIDU|5|Very pleased with fit and purchase, had lots of compliments.
B00BNAGF28|3|They are OK.  They fit kind of loose.  Maybe that's the way the diabetic socks are supposed to fit.  I wanted them because I couldn't find any ankle length, brown, size 15 socks.  Don't mow in them because the grass weaves itself in with the fabric of the sock and it's like picking nits to clean them.
B00MZ53MSA|4|Love the feel of this material - very warm and cozy.  The fit runs a little snug though, so I opted for the next size up.
B00AYKQE6U|1|The sleeves are in way too short and that shirt part is way too big
B000BT4UN8|5|Its a great quality tshirt at a decent price and my son loves it. I wore it to an Aerosmith concert and it was great.
B00Q7FC9UG|5|Great
B00M40SO52|5|Love this. The flowers look like little snowflakes for our Christmas photo. Also this is a true navy. There is no weird tint.
B00JO8IK0G|5|Great value<br />Very well made
B00IZV8CZ6|5|I really am pleased with this item, the fix is perfect. I have worn the coat twice so far. The construction of details and quality is very nice.
B00R3KSPFW|3|Excellent quality material with little to no stretch. At 5'3&#34; with a 34DDD bust and a 31 inch waist, large was like a tent on me. I could have sized down to a medium, but the cut of the top was more straight than it looks on the model. I would opt for the Justine instead or a Maevn Princess Cut/Dickies Xtreme Stretch top.
B00VFXYDRW|1|This item is mislabeled. It indicates one size on the outer bag and another on the tag in the shirt. In addition, the shirt runs small. As other reviewers indicate, the shirt does not have a shelf bra (it has weird, very thick pads that do nothing to add even the tiniest amount of support). Finally, the shirt is not really a compression shirt. It is more of a fitted tank that does not provide support or compression.
B00322PZBC|5|Great shirt! Gets washed and dried at least once a week and still looks perfect and is nice and soft.
B00DNOIMBE|5|Great fit. Nice quality!
B00QMO7376|2|These shirts are so inconsistent. I have ordered multiple styles, colors and sizes. The few that fit are my favorite shirts. But there is absolutely no consistency. I'll order the exact same shirt in the same size but a different color and it will fit completely different than the first. It's not worth trying ten to find two that works.
B0013OZ480|4|It didn't fit me but my son is proudly wearing it now and I bought a Extra Large for myself!
B003OQTQ0W|5|I LOVED
B00UZADWPA|2|Too small and even smaller after you wash them. I bought them to ever as pjs<br />But the material was hard.
B00PVRI662|5|Great price, definitely quality. Really happy with them
B00AOCXKZQ|1|Mine lacked the crazy awesome writing. I seriously wanted one with the broken English.<br />I hate this thing for lacking that.<br />Also, the blush circles are just holes in the painted on face, and are incomplete. The color is more peach than pink, and there are loose threads everywhere. It was covered in bits of stuffing when it arrived.<br /><br />It would have been redeemed by having the crazy writing on it, but alas, there is none to redeem it.<br /><br />For the record, I am 5 feet and 6 and a half inches tall, I weigh 160lbs, I have a 40&#34; bust line, and this hoodie fits fine.
B004MNM0CW|4|I was looking for a costume for a 60´s party and this suit really met my expectations : Looks like the original Beatles outfit, is very well done, it is confortable to be dressed and the price is very adequate.
B00595R48C|5|excellent
B00J7XUSJO|5|I am a vet and very patriotic and wanted something to show my love for freedom and the military.  This did it nicely.  The cap won't keep you warm in Antarctica but does a very nice job for your average cold weather.
B004R8Z3DA|3|A
B00G57CT1K|5|This dress is very sexy and form flattering, can't wait to wear it to a party.
B00OTT3R2G|5|Fits as it should and looks great.
B00N5O34TC|5|Fantastik
B00KI3J154|5|nice jacket
B00405RVVC|4|I got the hat in the mail today, and of course tried it on pronto.  I must say it's bigger in real life than the picture makes it seem; so much so that there is a significant amount of space on top of my head if I don't put the flaps up.  It didn't make my head hot to try it on inside, but it feels like it is layered well and will hopefully stand up to all of my winter activities.
B0083LDUBE|5|I ordered the medium size, I am 5'3 and wear a size 6, it was just slightly big which was perfect for me as I needed to wear long johns and thermal shirt underneath due to the cold weather.  The length would be better for someone about 5'6 or taller as it was too long on me, but since I have no sewing abilities I just picked it up as I walked.  The material is thin so if you are going to be in a well lit area you may want to wear a slip as it could become see thru.
B00VF0V9YK|5|Good belt. Well constructed, good printing, have sweat my you know what off while wearing it, no bleeding of color
B00SOQNKVI|5|The color caught my eyes.
B00HT12RCM|3|Don't like the fitting
B0040K3GUW|5|ok ok ok ok Okey this product is exelent, the product is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice, very happy whit this product
B0007KXC1M|5|Great bra, have been wearing Wacoal's for years.  You can't go wrong with a Wacoal bra.  Comfy, fits great, and they wash well.  You can't go wrong with a Wacoal for comfort and wear-ability.
B00BR05FRK|3|They were larger than normal, never felt right.  Dickies manufactures these things in so many different countries I highly recommend purchasing in store so you could try them on first.  Or get them here but be prepared to exchange a few times.
B00E0KSG52|5|I ordered this for my grandson who is 1 1/2. It fits him perfectly. Now he has one just like his dad! Really nice quality...hey, it's Carhart!
B005H278QU|5|Great product packed in a plastic bag and it look's better than the picture! I'm so glad that I belong to Amazon Prime.
B008YV633U|2|Just like in the picture, the cardigan doesn't come together in front. If you have any boobs at all you can totally forget it! A larger size would be too big everywhere else.
B00EK93RN4|4|Ran larger than I thought it would
B00A17BW7C|1|Received this hat and the white part was yellowish...like it was old and faded. Not a great look so I donated it.
B00JLGAKH2|5|Got this shirt for my husband because he is OBSESSED with motorcycles. He loves the shirt and gets lots of compliments on it.  The quality of the shirt is great and it fits perfectly.  Would definitely order again :)
B00N2S3S0G|5|I have been looking for jeans that my 10 year old daughter will wear. She has SPD (Sensory Processing Disorder) related to her Asperger's Syndrome which is on the Autism Spectrum. She has issues with clothing textures and she will not wear button up jeans. I did not want her to just have to wear leggings or sweatpants all the time She is very high functioning and high IQ and she loves fashion. She wants cute clothes to wear that won't bother her. With regular jeans she refuses to button them up so they are either falling off her or you can see under her shirt that she has her pants unbuttoned. So, I began looking for a solution. I noticed that she loves to wear her PJ bottoms all the time. She lives in them. So, I was happy to find these jeans that have the waistband that is like soft pj bottoms. She tried on the other pair we bought today and she loves them. They do seem to run small. She wears about a 12/1/2 to 14 and these 14s just fit her. They are not as roomy as her size 14 pj bottoms. So I would say order a size or two up.
B00FY7VRS8|5|Color matches the picture and the fabric feels really, really nice.  Can be worn as a work skirt or a party skirt.
B00ID2FLUG|5|Love them. Perfect for spring/summer :D
B005SVILLQ|4|Took a long time for shipping and came in an envelope not a box...a little bit crushed. .not really happy about that but is looked like what I expected ...only with some extra wrinkles.
B00L66KTLM|4|Pretty comfortable. I have a small rear end, but a large midsection, so finding a brief that doesn't roll down in the front is hard. They stay in place when I up during the day, but roll down when I'm sleeping. I would repurchase again because the are soft. I wish the cotton was thicker, but they will  do.
B00GTAGUAE|5|excellent
B0018OXB26|3|It is so hard to buy jeans without seeing in person. The pair I received was definitely 527 but it seems the cut and color are almost a crap shoot. Some fit slim and some wear long and have a wider waste like these. I'm 6' 1&#34; and 150lbs 32 x 34
B00022S382|5|This bra is GODLY. It fits like a dream! (38DD) and it gives AMAZING cleavage. It's comfortable, it's discreet beneath clothes, and geeze - I'm ordering another one RIGHT NOW. &lt;3
B00CJQ0T5E|4|The fabric is beautiful - it's of a really fine weave in the most gorgeous soft lavender color that is actually just a tiny bit more intense than the picture shows.  The cut and finish of the dress are superb, and the design is stunning on.  However, the sizing is a little off.  I almost always wear a 12, but usually order a 14 when the cut is trimmer (such as a sheath like this) to be safe.  This dress, in the 14, isn't even close to fitting.  It's still at least a size too small, and I'm not sure even one size up would be enough.  I am so disappointed - it really is a gorgeous dress suitable for work OR dress-up.
B008ADR3FO|3|They were great buttons to have great conversations.  However.  Some fell apart when trying to pin them on my guest.
B00HUAIF82|5|I have purchased shirts made by the Cactus Company in past years.  The shirts launder easily, keep their shape with no shrinkage.  The shirt color and design do not fade.  Rhinestones on the shirts do not disappear.  The designs on the shirts are fun to wear.
B00A4L5FYQ|5|I love the item, was a bit long though, but I am a bit short, so I won't blame it on the product.<br />It is just a great as it looks on the picture.
B006UESJRQ|5|These are great!  Comfortable and great padding.  Too bad my wife stole them.
B00OWDOJT4|5|Very happy with my purchase. Sizing was on point and dress is very comfy
B000XRCGCA|5|I think that Billingham PhotoVest is so good product for photographers who like tale pictures during travel. Also very nice for traveling by plane.
B00QU66F0M|5|Very nice shirt. Fit how I expected. Material is a little heavier than I thought, but still very nice.
B004YGR8OC|1|I bought this very expensive leather jacket over a year ago thinking that money would mean quality.  Also, I figured the perry ellis name couldn't go wrong.  I was wrong.  The leather is of the utmost ugly look one can possible never expect from a luxury item.  The leather is of poor quality and is apparent at first glance.<br /><br />Worse, within a year the seam of the leather tore and the jacket is now ripped open.  The one good thing that came out of this, I can now see the very thin innards and know for sure how badly I've been ripped off.  The jacket is now torn and thoroughly useless to wear.
B00M87W7ZY|5|I usually wear a small, but I ordered a medium. While I was putting them on I got worried that they were too small, but once I pulled them all the way up they were great. They're a little long but I expected that. The high waist is flattering and the fabric is soft. I quite love them.
B004DJXHXQ|5|great wallet; huge selection, great price!!!  good company to order from; great customer service - can't say enough.  keep up the great work.
B00AIZJWN8|5|Exactly what it looks like, pin is large, very Doctor. Delivered quickly
B0046LVKPS|5|Reasonable price for very expensive shirt was a high point. fast shipping and brand new. I would much rather purchase thru them than the original store.  very pleased and will buy again.
B00O9O12OQ|5|My wife has a new brand she loves and it's Patty Boutik. I bought her 4 different styles and colors from this brand for Christmas and they were her favorite shirts out of all the clothes I have her. She is 5'6&#34; tall, size zero and 32DD. The shirts fit like they were made personally for her in size S.
B00L8XN7D0|5|True to color!
B00E0HXY7A|5|Medium-weight.  Light colors, but not sheer.  Length falls as shown in photo and is comfortable.  Pretty v-neck detail, printed fabric, and well-stitched seams.  Comfortable fit, stays in place.  Next-day wrinkles minimal/not very noticeable.  Washes well.<br /><br />I have read a review saying arm holes are too large.  I find that they are fine as fabric stays close to body and larger holes provide comfort for movement.<br />*UPDATE: Although this particular gown has normal-sized arm holes, the other reviewer is correct in that some of the gowns have extra large ones.  They may have realized and corrected this...?<br /><br />This gown is holding up beautifully.
B00GRS99MY|5|My son like this shirt and I'm happy with my purchase.
B00DN5RJOY|5|Got this shirt for my little brother and it was a hit! Would definitely order again.
B008BHDIDK|5|I bought all the pieces to make my Ravenna costume perfect...I was a big hit (mainly because I look a lot like Charlize Theron) and really pulled off Ravenna! People even stopped me to take pictures with me and of me! :)
B006RHJ4ZW|3|I ordered these for my 13 yr old who is 4'10&#34; (99 lbs) and who normally wears a youth large or adult small in sports attire and 0 in other clothes.  Therefore, I thought according to the size chart the XXL would be perfect (or too large).  Wrong - they were much too small!  I did not return them because she loves the feel of these shorts but they were too short to wear to gymnastics practice or outside, so she sleeps in them.  I will look for a different brand of shorts that is not cut so small.
B00HLSRNJA|5|I normally don't write reviews but I just had to for this ! I was all for this for only $10 but after seeing it was nearly $20 with shipping I was kind of hesitant.. I found some other tie & suspender sets for way cheaper, but after reading all the positive reviews about this one, I decided to go for it. And let me tell you how glad I am that I did !! First of all, it is GREAT quality !! It said ot would be delivered in about 10 days but I got mine in 3 ! I got the child size for my 3 year old step son for our wedding and it fits perfectly ! I would definitely recommend this to anyone !!! The shipping costs are definitely worth spending a little extra money on. Super great quality!!
B0010B31V8|5|Typical Jockey quality...great.
B0077C88N0|5|I was searching for a purple jersey (polyester) for winter league ultimate. I found this tank and decided to give it a try. I read the reviews and ordered a size smaller like everyone before had recommended. This jersey is very very good. It definitely runs big. It feels heavier than it should be. It feels very durable. This item gets a 5 star review because it's a great deal.
B003E2T5O8|5|I really like these. They are soft, just the right size, easy to order, easy to wash & dry<br />I would recommend these.
B003ZYE3DS|3|Great  Product
B001B0Z8IC|4|Though most of the other items in this category specify &#34;shirt&#34; or &#34;bottom&#34; this item, by contrast, not only doesn't specify but specifically states that &#34;Tops have drop tail for added comfort and protection, Bottoms incorporate a drawcord for a custom fit&#34;.  There are no bottoms.  This description is false, please be warned.  I wouldn't have spent so much money and I don't appreciate having to wait more days for a bottom to match this top.  My wife was so excited too...<br /><br />Edit: Raised my review from one to three stars because despite the description issues, my wife really likes the top and she says that it may have been worth price.<br /><br />Edit2: Just an edit to acknowledge that the description has changed sometime since I posted the above.  That's good.  The top is still holding up after over a year and a half of light use.  Thanks and have another star.
B003QIW70O|5|Recently, the African nation of Mali lost control of its northern half to insurgents with a rather colourful background. The rebels have declared a new independent state, known as Azawad.<br /><br />Why doesn't the international community oppose this \\"state\\"? Azawad is essentially a coalition of al-Qaeda operatives and a bunch of Berber slave-raiders known as the Tuareg.<br /><br />Instead, the African Union and the UN spend most of their time whining about the military coup in Bamako. Yeah, I'm sure that's a far more pressing problem than taking action against a new safe-house for terrorists, crackpot theocrats and warlords of medievalism.<br /><br />Smash Azawad - defend Mali!
B00I3Q3TQ0|1|Do not like the material, it looks cheap, color is more pink than pictured, when I received it it was coming apart at the seam in the back. Good thing I only paid .70 for it. Or else I would have returned it.
B000BW0692|4|I had an old one with my company's logo on it I liked. But it was wearing out. I had a lot of trouble finding a thicker fleece vest in Navy for a women that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Everything was really thin or strange colors. I finally thought to look in the label of the vest I loved, and looked this brand up online. I found it here for a reasonable price, and it fit as expected.<br />I am finally happy to have a navy fleece vest without any corporate logo. The price was great. Very happy.
B00E0EHJ4C|3|Asked for black but they sent me a white one instead. Other than that it was fine.
B00015WT1W|5|I love the smell, its soo beautiful.  I love it because its so light, i can even wear it around my grandmother who is extremely sensitive to scents.
B00CD9EGFG|4|The pajamas were adorable, made out of nice fabric and seem durable, however, I believe the sizes run a little small. I ordered for my a average sized, slim 7 year old a size 7-8 years and they were significantly too small. Hard to guess sizing based on age, would have been easier to use standard sizes. Returned the too small ones and replaced them with the next size up without a hitch, no complaints, like the new ones, as does my son! I would order from this company again.
B00HVVLSN4|3|It was too small-I am sending  it back.
B00857SSLI|5|They are very comfortable
B004LZN9E4|4|I like it.<br /><br />The brush is completely black, the bristles are completely straight (no balls at the ends- so easier to pull the hair out).<br /><br />Only downfall, it's a lot smaller than the small brush I have that I'm replacing.<br /><br />It's about as small as you can get, and it will take some getting used to...<br /><br />Shipped perfectly and timely, no problems.
B005PJ1NJS|5|Awesome pair of pants.  They fit well and the color is amazing.  They don't shrink a lot when you wash and dry them which is a huge plus.
B001TCZW6U|4|This is a nice replica of the warm-ups used by the Flint Tropics in the &#34;Semi Pro&#34; movie. For the price, I think that the Tropics logo on the front could have been stitched on instead of being screen printed. If the logo was a more authentic, stitched on design, then I definitely would have given 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, though: the material and stripes are high quality and a very comfortable, breathable costume.
B004UUJV4C|5|I expected it to be a little big on me but it looks fine. Got compliments on Halloween and I was so warm and comfy walking in the rain :D
B00UXQ338W|2|no support
B00H7U0ILM|3|I bought a 8 size for my girl but a little smaller than regular 8 size,so I repace 10 size and it's a perfect..
B009B2U3G4|5|I love this scarf I have found so many gorgeous items from Luxury Divas. I always get complements on the scarf when I wear it. Its trendy and accents the most basic outfit. I pair it with a plain tunic and leggings. It's just the right amount of color.
B00W2W42GW|4|Nice socks!!
B000FOCHAM|1|After only used twice and it stop working. very cheap stuff. Don't buy this one.
B00UUC648K|5|My granddaughter will love this.  She is 15 and loves Olaf.  Came in a very timely manner.
B004QF0TF6|5|good stuff
B005CPSA4G|5|I love this robe!  It is superbly comfortable and cozy.  The price was a very nice advantage as well.  I like the hood as well.  It is a nice feature.  I highly recommend this robe!
B0030Y19LC|2|Pretty ugly -- the back is not as low as needed and the sides show too.  Different dress it may be ok - but if you sit down the whole thing rises up. I'm returning.
B000K8ALVA|4|This bathrobe is super soft and warm. I love it. My only complaints about it are that the inner ties are pretty...sketchy. They just don't seem like they need to be there and they're not great quality. The fuzzy balls also feel like they're not the best quality. HOWEVER, the price was great for the quality of the product. I love it.
B00N3XAJV6|5|This shirt came exactly as pictured. It was true to size and the shirt was a good quality. I can't believe how fast the shirt arrived at my home. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00EMEK6ZO|5|Nicer than the picture, well designed . Very happy with the acquisition. The colors are really what I expected. Already used it twice as I am in Summer !!
B00JBYKJRU|3|The s*** was okay, pattern was cute. It is slightly sheer. The quality was not great, there were loose threads in a few areas, and although the top was very spacious the stitching at the hips was too narrow. It is workable, if the top is going to be tucked or just resting above the hips. Going up a size would not help as the rest of the shirt would be entirely too large. For reverence I usually wear a xs-s in US tops and I ordered the small.
B00R7VTLV4|4|These are ok, a little baggy for us. They looked nicer in the photo than in reality.
B008G17JOK|5|Stylish, cool, never out dated. Classy for cruise ships or a stroll on the pier. Look like you're in Miami wherever you are.
B008ESE1SW|3|Got it delivered a day ago. I liked the pattern but not the color. Looks like it has been washed hundred times, so cheap. Wouldn't order again.
B005OFLSF2|3|For over ten years I bought Calvin Klein basic briefs size 34 (perfect fit for me). Then I made an online purchase of Tommy Hilfiger size medium. They are a bit small and become very uncomfortable when I play tennis. If you are purchasing this item it would be wise to go with one size larger. Everything else (the elastic band, fabric, cut, etc.) is in perfect order.
B0052URUD8|4|Just love my new HOBO wallet - stores everything - and you can just grab it out of your purse and run into the store - you can carry it  as a clutch as well - it works great for those of us that need thing organized.
B004UH74PI|5|Thanks to a previous reviewer I ordered the M size, even though I am a size 4 (5 in juniors). The dress was (even so) a little tight, but not horrible. Different to other reviewers mine came with the 'sequins' properly attached, Just lost a few while dancing (a lot) during our theme party.<br />It is very short. Perfect for any one under 5'5&#34;.
B00FR3MF2Q|2|Very sad. Giving it away......
B00V7SHF1G|1|Way too small!! More like size Small than XL!
B00K5A6OP0|1|Was way smaller then store versions and n aerial ass cheap looking. Sewing was messy too. Very disappointed
B0058CFIWU|2|Alright, here it is, great fit, stay cool, wicks moisture... all true and great features.  That said, I don't like them because I like to pee standing up.  If you like to pee standing up, you might want to consider a different brand.  Why you ask?  No fly, no access, huge hassle, embarrassing urinal etiquette, ... that's why!  I cannot understand why any underwear makers would make boxer briefs without access, it baffles me.  Your choice is to either go in a stall and sit, gaining the reputation of a man who sits to pee, fumble with your junk to get it above the waistband, or drop trou like a 3 year old at the urinal.  No thanks, I will keep looking.  Should Champion choose to put a fly on these otherwise great undies, I will try again and would most likely give a 4 or 5.<br /><br />Signed<br />A Man Who Pees Standing
B003COZCJA|2|These are great fitting and very comfortable, but I have had to return two pairs that had defects. The fabric was so thin - presumably from the distressing process - that they ripped on the first wearing. I am not a large person, performing unnatural acts, or trying squeeze into a size too small. I get that rips are part of the worn look, but an $80+ pair of jeans should be able to survive far beyond a few days of normal wear and activity. I have not had the same experience with other Buffalo jeans. Just this type. It's disappointing because I really do like the look and fit.
B00RGQS70Q|2|Cheap...fits too sizes too small...worth every penny...every cheap penny
B00C7OPLQ0|2|I was so excited when I got my jeans from the mail but when I tried it on, the fit was a bit loose on the thigh area and it gave it a baggy look.  I also did not like the fading part.  I was disappointed with this particular pair of jeans.
B00P1901DQ|4|It took a long time to get here, but worth the wait, very cool shirt!
B00AKW0S1E|1|These leggings don't fit the way they say they do.  My daughter who I ordered them for is only 5'2&#34; and 116 lbs and the description says it fits up to 5'7&#34; and 121 lbs.  Not true.  They were so small she couldn't get them on all the way.  I'm very disappointed.
B00JTRSFY8|4|Perfect
B0043VDK36|5|Love it!  Very soft.. very comfortable.. exactly what I was looking for.
B006B2RX88|5|Cute. Fits as expected and my boyfriend loves it! It is little short like the picture, if you don't like that then don't buy. If you do get it :)
B00FY7VAQM|1|I wore this skirt maybe 3 times before it started to get little balls of fuzz coming off of it. It seems to be worse on the back and sides of the skirt than in the front, but it doesn't look as nice as when I first purchased it. It feels uncomfortable now with all the balls of fuzz on it. Disappointed with this purchase. -Angie
B00CBBBIKC|4|fits as expected she likes it
B0051U15TE|4|Having always used this company for my husbands work clothes, I felt confident when ordering these socks. They are very nicely made but after washing and drying once they look like my 12 year old son could wear them. They still fit him but just a bit snug. And yes, I ordered the correct size!
B00OZ997L0|4|I ordered my size and the top is a bit snug. I would suggest ordering this top in extra large if you are an american size 8-10
B00G363AQ6|5|It is very good, I like it, but it is a little large
B00I52M5PI|3|a  little tight...
B0081SJE5K|4|the foam inserts come out every time you machine wash.  Tired of putting the inserts back in.
B00L9IF7TG|5|I purchased this jacket and pant set for my baby girl, Eve, and I can honestly say I am envies (wish I had one in my size)! The organic cotton is beyond soft and so cuddly. The finish is excellent - from the stitching and cut down to the smallest detail. With that said, it was a little big on my daughter but that is OK because I have already washed the set a few times and it was made to last. It arrived in a beautiful gift box which was a nice surprise. Very happy with this purchase, 5 stars all the way.
B00GJ2G142|1|I am really upset that I wasted part of my gift card on these! They do not fit as expected, shrunk horribly upon washing and immediately started &#34;pilling&#34; up the entire length of the legs. I was flat out lied to on another comment and decided to give these a try and as I said, I am highly disappointed.
B00B8GS5XY|5|love this bikini. It fits great, its comfortable and the bottom does not get saggy. buy for next summer ladies! :)
B00LAEWDUK|4|Lovely color of royal blue and fits well.  Just what I was looking for!  And for the price--perfect.
B00C1ZTKY4|3|my mistake
B001DKCX6K|4|a little loose, but overall good
B00E4Y4450|5|i love it but then again i wish the leggins came with it because i bought the rong kkind so
B00CQ8JKPU|4|I ordered two scarves, both came on time. They sort of smell, but I tossed them in the dryer for a few minutes with a dryer sheet and sprayed a little perfume on them and the smell faded to almost nothing. They look great!
B00CKGBCBS|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. My friend keeps threatening to steal it from me! I would advise though that anyone ordering choose a size smaller because it streetches. I ordered in a hurry and didnt think about that.  It works nonetheless!
B008RVZPTU|5|Been wearing this brand of shorts for a couple years and love them, the color slate look's a little off in the picture to the actual product, possible lighting issue? won't stop me from wearing them.
B003Y5IBI6|5|This shaping vest does NOT roll up and smooths out the muffin top and tummy. AND, is fairly comfortable for hours of wear.<br />I'm convinced that there's no shaper invented that will do exactly everything as desired. But this is very close. Makes you look neat in clothes. Be sure to get the right size for your waist.
B00BXP8D8M|5|I love this dress. Very flattering fit. Dots are painted on. Wash by hand to prevent dots from coming off.
B00HHKL8A2|5|Love these tops! soft and comfortable and great for leggings or skinny jeans. I plan to order a couple of the other styles!!
B00S8HIC4S|4|Arrived within days; the socks fit perfect for my 4 and 5 year old grand girls and they loved them.  The material is good quality and after a year they are still wearing them.
B00Y17LG6K|5|Love this dress!!!! I wore this out on a girls night out and received a lot of compliments. The material is good quality and it fit just as described.
B00H7J5O2Q|1|There is not a speck of Green in this scarf! There is Turquiose, grey and orange. Feel ripped off, think company<br />should make it right, Fashion Upscale Inc. Christmas is only days away and I am stuck with this!
B00LP90YOM|4|Very nice and comfy
B008KWXVJ2|4|It's good parka for winter season like now.<br />But its color of chest park of cloth, has little faded into light.<br />Maybe it's old-established one.
B0066SK5IC|3|the product looked very good on the page.  I was expecting the brim to be a little fuller to give it the true fadora flare.
B00JZZI53A|5|Love this tshirt.. Fits as expected.<br />Fast delivery
B00A9WZX38|5|These socks are perfect for me.I work 12+ hour shift and they are cool yet supportive. They feel as good putting them on as they do after a long day.Going to be my go to sock for me
B00OM8UDVW|2|Nice material, should not state FREE SIZE. This was tight on my husband and he wears a 34-36&#34; waist in pants. This was very embarrassing as being part of his birthday present because the &#34;best husband ever&#34; concept was cute and they don't even fit...regret buying them now.
B00P7ECEOE|5|In a review it said ran a size small. Normally a medium ordered a large fits great.
B00559VT2Y|5|Love them
B00IKMRHKG|5|Not much to say. It came on time and functions perfectly. My girlfriend bought to attach to her e-cigarette so she could wear it around her neck. It does exactly that, no complaints.
B00IM7ZDFU|2|I wore this shirt under a button up on a long flight. The color bled from the t-shirt into the button up, indelibly. I also find that this shirt 'skirts out' a lot, and the sleeves are too long.
B007IRL9XA|5|Is a Christmas gift for my Elfster. Hopefully he'll like it I liked the way it looked, well will see
B006HKYZLC|4|This set is a very basic set of 2 tie bars, which is what I was looking for.  The clip on the back is solid and the bar itself is long enough to get a good hold on the tie and your shirt.  Nothing fancy but does the job.
B00K6YEOX4|2|The lace is only on the front. The back is made of black jersey fabric. The edges are not scalloped but go straight across and have been poorly cut with a scissors and not finished. I ordered a small and it fits ok but the waist doesn't come in like it shows in the picture. It's a lot less fitted and more flowing than it shows in the picture. I'm disappointed. I felt they cut corners on this one and the one they sent me is not as pictured. I may try to alter it myself and keep it, but I wouldn't buy this brand again.
B0015U86CI|1|We bought these for my son as a reward and within 5 minutes, they were broken. He was not rough on them either... just putting them on his stuffed animals. TERRIBLE. Waste of money.  And now he is upset so I have to go buy new ones.
B006R8A5VI|4|These are nice looking, stylish and comfortable pants.  I like that they come up to my waist and the legs are long . . . one odd thing is that they are tight in the calves. And my calves are kind of on the skinny side!  They're looser in the thighs, tight on the calves.  Like jodhpurs, only not quite. :)  I actually like them, but if you have muscular calves it could be a problem!
B00JB8P2XC|4|It's a good warm jacket. but $180 is a lot of money for a faux one
B002KQE8QO|4|Arrived fast!<br />Beautiful dress!<br />Came with pink straps and a black scarf type thing.<br />The only thing wrong was the size which most people seem to say to order a size or two bigger.<br />I took others advice and ordered a size bigger.<br />It was still too small.<br />I sent it back and they got it the next day.<br />I also recieved my full refund and it was free to send it back.<br />I recommend getting it atleast 2 sizes bigger.
B001871B5C|4|I grew up in the 60's in NJ where winters were tough, and we all wore long johns that kept a person warm. Today, most sets are paper thin and do nothing to keep a man warm. This set, while pricey and not as thick as they used to be, is far better than what most department stores sell, and better than the popular underwear brands. I highly recommend these to you. I purchased the XL long, to accommodate for shrinkage. I normally wear just XL.
B00WWP87CE|5|Love it! ❤
B000N8RVZQ|3|Nothing special except a pair of work pants.
B00076ZRLY|4|A nice soft, comfy shirt for lounging around the house.  Cut well.  Tagless is very nice.  No issues with threads or stitching.
B000MX3R6Y|5|fit perfectly
B001DKSZ4Y|1|This jacket looks nothing like the picture. I was so disappointed when I received it. Its kind of a shiny, dark pea green color. The material is really cheesy and plastic-y. It seemed to fit large and boxy. I did go to the store to try it on before I purchased it online, since I had an Amazon gift card. I didn't see it at the store, but if it was there I wouldn't have recognized it. I sent it back the same day I received it.
B000A0UF6O|5|Excellent tights!
B00MHDY59U|3|Nice blouse but the measurements were a little off.
B006PI26FS|5|This was a replacement for one we had before.  The SHARKK is everything we expected.  No issues.  We did find that the clip to open it was easier than the one we previously purchased at Bed, Bath & Beyond.
B003QMM79Q|3|Very good. Not the fault of dockers.  Just poor food absorption by my dietary system
B000KGI9VQ|5|I've been wearing Carhartt forever and this one is no disappointment. It's stiff to start, and noisey, you won't sneak up on anyone, but breaks in quickly, the hood is a pain to start with, but if you don't zip the jacket all the way up, it tends to lay flatter, until it's had some wear time to settle. Very warm and surprising light, compared to the duck version I've always  worn. Good quality, will last and will take a working mans beating and belongs in the outdoors. Perfect for harsh weather without having to wear multiple layers. It does run big. I normally wear a Large, but opted to go with a Medium. I'm 6'2,  215lbs. I'm glad I read the reviews regarding size, you won't be sorry you went down a size, unless you like this jacket baggy.  I'm told it can take up to 50 washings before you need to retreat it with ScotchGuard or the like. It will be best to wash  in cold water and let hang dry. I've have the matching black bibs 8 years now and they just don't fade, so I expect the same from this jacket, being the same material. I have but one criticism, I wish this was made in the USA ! But over all, this is a CARHARTT and you can't go wrong with that !!!
B00E1YRI5Q|2|Seems to be decent quality tulle, but when it came it stunk awful. Like plastic and fish. It's been airing out for over a week.
B007TAZTBE|5|I bought these for my 8,7,6,5 and 4 y.o little angels. Too bad they wont let em wear it at school, which is BS. Anyways LOVE the shirt, please make em in more colors!!!
B00R71QDJ2|5|My Daughter tried these on and said the panties were soft and smooth. She told me the fit was perfect but a little hot at night. Well made and cute brief panties...worth the price and will purchase again as she needs them.
B00NBNWG3M|5|Fun and cute little dress!  can be dressy or casual!  and it's comfortable!
B00HPQI3G0|3|I really like the outfit but it definitely runs small on my five year old.  We will be wearing it more as a tunic with leggings than as a dress!
B00HVP8WSO|5|Beautiful fit.... great material... would definitely recommend!
B00KMQKKPM|4|This dress is perfect if you're short. I'm 5'2'', 110lbs and it comes down to my ankles. I've washed it about five times now and the elastic is still strong and flexible. The only drawback is that you need to wear leggings underneath. Though the dress is a gorgeous color with beautiful lacework around the waistline, it's somewhat see-through.
B00JQGIPVA|5|This brand fits like it was tailored for my husband. You cannot beat the price however it is a very slim European fit. I don't think that it would fit ever body type but what a great value!
B00JSC5YI4|4|The small size fit me like a medium size because I'm petite. However, it's a nice dress and I love the colors, black and white.
B007SWWJ34|5|My son wanted a Plant vs Zombies theme for his 10th Birthday. Since there's hardly any merchandise, I got him this shirt to add to the party flavor. To my surprise, the shirt is better than I expected. The quality of cotton is super and very soft. The color is brilliant and the silk screening is thick and well adhered.
B010MZDXKG|5|Awesome shirt, can't wait to wear it
B000FKMEI6|5|My husband, who is tall and solid,  has finnicky tastes and is sometimes hard to shop for, but when he tried on these socks, he loved them. Comfortable, look nice, stay in place and the gold toe prevents tearing.  Plan to purchase more for him.
B00KLF2VE2|4|BEFORE BUYING THIS.<br /><br />.  I bought the Dark Ink color and it will bleed and bleed for ever. after 6 washes it is still bleeding and getting Lighter. so FYI.<br />.  Know that this will starch out a hole size after the first wash. Bought a 13 and it was snug but ok. washed and it feels like a 15 now.<br /><br />i like the feel and look of it while its on. only complaint is that its not as dark or as tight now lol.
B00WMAMI5G|2|Waaaay to small. There was no way it was an XXL. Waste of time and money.
B00FPEQTJM|4|Pretty , larger and light weight.
B0000AWIF4|3|You know, we're a pretty lax society if these underwear get to prance around and call themselves fantastic.  I'm no fancy society maiden, but I do think a little old-fashioned grade inflation is going on if these underwear are waltzing in at an even five-star.  Five-star? This is the Waldorf-Astoria of underpants?  We're talking about a silken Raging Bull strapped around my lower body?  Let's take a deep breath and really get into these underpants, without all the hyperbole and gushing praise of the typical underpants fan-boys.    First, these underwear are smooth.  There's no doubting it, smooth underwear are nice sometimes, and these even have a little bit of that zipping noise when you swoosh them around on your covers.  But they didn't really take into account those times when you don't want to swoosh, when smoothness isn't the comfort level you need.  Also, sometimes you don't always want the same comfort on both your legs and your underparts.  I found myself many nights feeling like some flexibility would have been nice, detachable legs or a knob or something to vary the level of coarseness some regions, while keeping it relatively smooth on others.    Secondly, they do reach a long way down.  You'd be surprised if you're used to normal boxer shorts; these go down almost to your feet.  I sent my first two pairs back, hoping to find some that fit me, but in the end, even the smallest pair went down to my calves.  Also, it was very tight and was more like brief-capris.  And yes, for those of you who see the picture, that's really how far most of them go.  I just thought it was a very short man or maybe a boy who bought some older person's underwear in order to feel more mature but I think that's a regular man there.    Finally, and this is only a small quibble, but I think an important one.  The \\"diamond crotch\\", \\"fly opening\\" is in the back, so you have to twist them all the way around just to take a pee.  It's almost just easier to pull them all the way down at the urinals than to take your pants all the way off in a public bathroom.
B000E0T0KW|5|No doubt that this is the one piece everyone should get.  Fits perfect on me and look forward for more purchases.
B00EOM73BY|4|The fabric is nice and easy to iron, it was a bit big on the sides for hubby as he likes comfort fit clothing, we fixed it and it looks great.
B008DS18UC|5|For a cheap o belt this is so adorable I love it. Fits perfectly around my hips and looks great with a pair of jeans!
B00I6IZDYG|4|the pants are really nice...just did not fit me....tight in the waist and too big in the leg.....if you are smaller waisted, these might be perfect for you....
B00ICGK75W|5|Love this dress soooo much and the fit is perfect.  Looks elegant.
B00JS3EV00|5|Beautiful  Sexy!
B0042YYQ1Y|5|This is so cute! I just love it!
B00UIM2EWC|5|Of course my granddaughter loves it!  It's from Frozen!
B00A0TIU44|5|I was nervous to buy this online.  I was looking for coats in town and found that Macy's carries Kenneth Cole.  I felt much more confident when I knew how this brand fit me.  I am 5'3\\" and weigh 125.  The size 6 fits me great.  I received compliments on it the first time I wore it.  It is very classy looking and wonderfully flattering.  The only drawback for me is the length of the belt.  It wraps 3/4 of the way around my waist.  A small inconvenience for such a beautiful coat.
B00D1R82Z4|3|You get what you pay for!!
B00WPBK7LE|5|Such a cute shirt.
B00CFCXF5I|1|THREE sizes too small. Korean people are not tiny, but this company would have you think so. Either this one was mislabeled or they all are. I feel like this company is perpetuating a stereotype to dump &#34;slim fit&#34; clothing that was made too small.<br />Poorly packaged, the buttons were smashed in transit and left stains on the cloth.<br />Would not purchase from this suppler again.
B00DN1CNNK|2|The sizing of these chef coats are way, way, waaaayyyyy off, I bought a small and my friend who is a XXL can fit in this shirt comfortably, to make it more clear I am 5'2&#34; and my friend is 6'8&#34;!!!!
B00B9BPUAE|5|I bought the dress for my daughter for her 3rd birthday and she loves it..... Thank you mud pie for making my daughter eyes glow with excitement whenever she this outfit.
B0058SV7MO|3|It was ok, not great.
B003A2846M|5|These shirts came very quick and the sizing chart was dead on. My girls wear them all the time, and they have yet to fade. I will be purchasing more through this company. VERY HAPPY
B00EL8HPTQ|5|Fit great!
B0058A09ZS|3|I bought and specific size miniature schnauzer and the size that I receive it seems that it fits to a great dane. Luckily I have a Doberman and it fits perfect!
B00BYRS9CY|1|This shirt stretched out so much that I couldn't wear it again. Paid way to much for one wearing. Very disappointed!
B006SRTFY6|5|Really comfortable.
B003Y3A3KC|2|It served its purpose, but wasn't wonderful. It was cheap, so the quality was cheap as well. The bump was a teased lump of something covered by a few strands of hair- it was hard to restyle or comb it to make it look neat. Hairs would pull way to long and need to be cut and it tangled really easily. I guess you pay for what you get; it worked for this Halloween, but not sure I could use it multiple times, it's falling apart.
B00F54MP86|4|What a great hat... get one. Get two. If it only came in other colors than black or brown. A nice Red
B0014GVH92|4|The skirt was perfect for my daughters dance class.  The fit was true to size.
B00CXLBB7U|5|Fits well and super soft! What a steal at less than $20! Says to hand wash (like I have time!?) I threw it in a delicate bag on gentle and hung to dry. It was perfect!
B002FU61KQ|3|The waist on the pant is odd. Tight but the rest of the garment is loose.  Material is great quality. Feels like a brushed canvas - soft not stiff.<br />Just an off fit. Maybe to address gardener's exposure but there is still a gap because the waist slides down and gaps even when snug.<br />But for 19.99, free shipping and a blend of cotton and canvas who really cares?
B00UQK35EM|2|The width is ok but I have difficulty releasing the buckle , it sticks and if I'm in a hurry well it could a big problem
B002TLTS8I|4|So happy to find these on Amazon!  My daughter has been going through a &#34;phase&#34; and not liking anything I've purchased.  Over $30 in underwear purchases later, I finally came across these, which I haven't been able to find in stores.  She loves them and no more morning fights over having to wear underwear!
B0072Z2Q5S|1|I am so disapointed in this t shirt. It is a cheap Hanes baggy t shirt. It must have been folded around cardboard because it is faded in the front in a square pattern. The &#34;got porsche&#34; lettering is cheap iron-on. I contacted the seller through Amazon and no response yet after 5 days. It was supposd to be an anniversary gift for my husband since he just got a new Porsche but he would be embarrassed to wear this in public. Guess he can use it to was wash the car in the carport.
B00EFEPHO6|5|I bought this shirt to go under a sheer top that I wanted to wear for Christmas. It fits perfect and was way warmer than I thought it would be! I'll definitely buy this brand again!
B0084R1C3K|4|I'm going to say this fit as expected BECAUSE I read the reviews that other people said it ran large.  So, thank you, reviewers.<br /><br />I've been wearing mostly Medium and Large-sized shirts over the past couple weeks, but I bought this in a small.  I think I would have been slightly better off with a medium, but the small works just fine and should last me the last 5 weeks of my pregnancy.  I like the long style of it.  It's really comfortable.  I actually imagine I'll wear this over leggings and such when I'm not pregnant, too.  It's pretty comfortable, plus I bought it on sale!
B00RMG50EG|4|Somewhat small but once I got it on it looked fantastic !!!!
B00F6CKN9U|1|The fit and looked fine when i put it on and the material is good but when i washed it for the first time it shrunk a whole foot!!!  This is not pre shrunk and given that it shrunk that much they should have warned.  Now i cannot wear this ever again because it looks silly.  Usually thinks shrink about an inch at most if they do.  Very disapointed.
B00ANQT7I2|5|Excellent quality
B00G6BVEOS|4|Chest size good but too small in bust.
B00064CESG|2|I normally wear a 2X sweater. I like my sweaters to fit a little loose;This sweater fits like a1X on me,real tight. I'm sending it back. I hope a 4X will fit me more loosely. Some of your other buyers says the sweaters runs smaller. They said you should buy at least two sizes up from your regular size. They should let you know the sweaters run a little small. Then you could order a larger size or two.I hate that I got to spend extra time and money to send it back.  Thank you for the time to let me VENT.  Richard Scott
B004XH5ZII|3|The color is not the same as that I expected. I want it to be a bit brighter colored.<br />I would need more time to get used to this deep navy.
B000N8X1HI|3|Larger than expected
B00F4YC0I2|3|It's a nice hat. It looks good but for the price is very flimsy. I've paid less before for more material.
B00FCZDC3A|5|It's an awesome scarf. My only problem is I don't have more of them!
B005GYGEXC|5|The leggings are perfect for my workout and 5K walk routine.  The fabric is medium weight and fit is comfortable.
B000QTAAT6|4|I got this shirt for my wife because she is a big Twilight fan.  And she loves it.  But the shirt seems a little \\"homemade\\", the quality is not great.  It seems like one of those shirts you find at a dollar store.  But, my wife loves it because she loves the books, so I count that as a wise purchase.
B00ITNV1U8|5|NICE SHIRT GREAT STYLE AND COLOR. ALL CUTTER AND BUCK SHIRTS ARE GREAT.
B011D59XNU|1|Not only were they too small but I measured them and the measurements were barely a size small...they were suppose to be a women's large (12-14) ....they were not even close
B00Y20NXMQ|1|Got my veil and it does not look like anything like the photo. The roses are a completely different material and what's suppose to be ivory is peach. The veil itself is small and doesn't go over my head like the bride in the photo. I will be returning this item.
B00BXT56P6|5|Im not gonna lie, I was actually impressed by the quality and detail. Very cool product. Definitelly a good value.
B00N27AUK8|5|These are nice and thin so that my feet don't get too hot. I love the colors - the red ones are more like a Christmas red and less orange-y than they look in the photo.
B003PCOGJ6|5|Again great T shirt, quality and print brilliant, but think I'll be ordering a large next time, as the extra large is like wearing a night shirt, but still great!
B002ATD5FG|5|Had to own this shirt. Being a big Manson fan. It shows Manson in a dark, Gothic way, which would keep most holy roller away. The shirt is from 2003, when Golden Age of Grotesque came out. That's when Manson toured with Twiggy, before he left the band foe awhile. The shirt got Manson on front, tour dates on back. I would definite wear this shirt today, as I would back then.
B0076R6LGM|3|Maybe I have long arms, as a 6'6&#34; tall male, but the sleeves are just a little too short. It is warm enough, and I still wear it under a rain jacket as my winter coat / coats.  But I do not wear by itself as the sleeves are a little short for my liking.
B00GHTE4KU|5|It may have taken a while to get here but the sweater is great quality and looks like the picture!
B008UYK0OO|1|If you want sweaty feet that smell horrible, and a slippery sensation that makes you fall down and your shoes slide off your feet unexpectedly, these are the socks for you!  I ended up giving them to the Goodwill donation shop - some still in the package, as these were truly the most horrible thing I've ever put on my feet.  Yuck!
B009RP5WUW|5|I am very pleased with this scarf. I originally purchased the 12 foot version, but decided I needed the 6 foot one for more practical daily use. Surprisingly warm and soft!
B007O0UGYY|5|The item is as was expected and good quality.  It expanded the corset the way I needed it to, but I lost weight quickly and it's now to wide.  I may order a smaller one and pass this along to a friend.  .
B00W2WX09M|5|Good for this price. If you are a C or bigger your boobs will pop out. Cute. I'm 5'4&#34; and ends below my butt, 34 B and almost cover my nipples. Usually wear S and this is like an Xs or S
B004NQRIKM|1|too small, only an annorexic would be able to fit in these, such a shame because they were super cute..
B00062NNLU|5|Bought this for my dad for Christmas. He really llikes it. Fits really well and was just as promised and described.
B0035QLRKS|3|no body likes when they want to wear a cute strapless top/dress, and their bra straps are hanging out. exactly why i purchased this. welllll, i'm a 36D borderline DD (ugh) and it has great coverage but as tight as it is,it lacks support. for the price i'm happy with it, if it had cost anymore than i'd be a little upset. it came sooner then expected which is always nice.
B00B7O7NC6|3|It stretches out after a while and the button fell off but was easy to sew back on. Fit better than when I first got it.
B00D5703AW|1|I haven't even had a chance to wear this item yet and the white/black designs are peeling already. After receiving the shirt, I washed it and noticed how poor the quality of the design was. I want my money back please. Not only that, but there was NOT a return label with the package, now I have to contact Amazon for a return label for my refund, what an inconvenience. Will not order from this seller or recommend it unless something is done. Oh, and another thing, why do I need to pay for shipping to return this? \\"You will need to pay for return postage costs.\\" What kind of crap is this?
B00WA31S2Y|1|It's not embroidered, it's embroidered patches sewn on. (Picture shown) After you wash it, it looks chewed up and on the inside all the strings from the patches get tied up into knots. The color's are correct as shown, the fit, fits odd, and after you wash it, it will shrink. It ships directly from China so the sizes are off, and the shipping takes longer to receive. I would not waste your money. You can have my blouse for free!
B00CI9TQJC|5|Great sweater... very warm...worth the price.
B007SVIDJE|5|so, I ordered this dress because it is so pretty, However, I came across the lime green one right after that. So I sent this one back and stuck to the lime green one.
B00MR133QS|5|The shirt is exactly as pictured. Made from good heavy weight material. I am very satisfied.
B002R0F83K|4|very cute leotard with tutu. Has a cute bow in the back and small silver stars on the tutu. Does fit on the small side for being a size 6-8 so I wouldn't recomend it for a size 8, my daughter is a size 7 and it fits her perfectly no room for growth. Also has a nude colored lining on the inside.
B00MHN9MRK|5|I LOVE these, once washed and dried they fit perfectly and they wash well. Super cute and super soft. Its very hard to find underwear for toddlers/early potty learners. These are perfect and for organic cotton perfectly priced.
B00CBUT8IM|3|I love this blouse, but it was too large, and when I went to get a smaller size, there were no alternatives.
B003AIKW7U|4|I love how soft and comfy the Kicky Pants PJ set and Coveralls are for my baby and toddler and the colors are very nice. I only gave them 4 stars out of 5 as they are quite pricey. If they were a bit less expensive both of my children would love in Kicky Pants only.
B00BSGAJ7O|3|This mask is made with plastic very thin plástic and can be broke any time but is great<br />For Halloween
B00593599A|5|My daughter loves to use this sweet little umbrella, and the high canopy keeps her dry even in a fairly heavy rain.  It is even cuter in person.
B00NSI8ICS|5|Love this! Exactly as advertised.
B008EEZNNI|5|Great wallet. Just as advertised.  NIcely packed.  Arrived promptly.
B00MR4R0VE|1|Cheap quality
B0081UBM0S|5|I usually wear a 16-18 in clothes, I went with the 3x (because the only other option was 1x and I didn't want it to be tight)....  it fits fine, maybe a little big, but not falling off big...  it's very cute and with a tank top, it will be fitting to wear around children...
B007ZQ8KHM|4|All thought the hat was very big, my newborn will grow into it.
B00A7Y5MT8|4|Very nice quality shirt.  Vibrant color.  Looks good!
B00HYPPDFG|5|I love this brand! And these jeans fit perfectly and are super comfortable.
B00ATKCFHW|5|Ok
B00I75IXVS|5|When you are planning to name your new baby boy after two of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy film directors of all time, George Lucas and Peter Jackson, it is clear you are a nerd.  So, your new baby, whom is also probably going to be a nerd as he grows up, needs an equally nerdy outfit to come home in from the hospital.  Thus, a light blue onesie, similar in color to Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, which he inherited from his father, in Episodes 4 and 5, with the words &#34;The Force is Strong With This One&#34; is perfect for the event.  Our little guy, Lucas Jackson, will be coming home in style!
B00JBJQH8K|5|Very good quality - nice and thick.  They did stretch a bit but not as bad as other leggings I have purchased.  Great leggings for the price!
B00LEOOITA|5|SO WARM AND COMFY. This jacket is definitely a winter staple. I usually order a small in tops/jackets but wanted something roomier for layering, the medium is perfect. Roomy enough for winter layering, but not baggy.
B00B54Z0OG|5|Back in the 80's, I saw Iron Maiden in concert five times, kept the ticket stub and  bought some shirts. Flash forward today, lost the stubs and don't know whatever happened to the shirts.  Call it a mid-life crisis, but went online and found and bought this one.  I am very happy with the purchase...shirt came in quickly and fit as ordered.
B001RXMRKK|3|It's too large!
B00F9B5L6S|4|The worked out great for our groomsmen and they were true to color.
B003O6QNU8|4|Lots of complements at the Luau party!
B00DJROFI4|5|Purchased 2XLT as a gift. It is difficult to find that size in stores, so I was pleased to find it on Amazon and with free Prime shipping. It arrived quickly, and looks to fit well. The length is good for a tall (6'5&#34; man.) Fleece is good quality and the color was as pictured. The gift-ee was pleased with the vest, thumbs up from me!
B005IEWDTE|1|Unable to wear 3x usually fit me well
B002YX0KE2|3|This is a pretty bra, but I'm a 42DD and this bra offers no support.
B00CZ7TWKK|5|I may just buy more!
B00KGSMHF2|5|Very nice!  The dress fits well,  and I like it.
B00K065QDK|3|Good quality. Careful with description. I ordered purple boy pajamas. I received a much lighter purple than was pictured and the embroidery was pink. unhappy with this last purchase.
B005SM8G2E|5|I purchased this sweatshirt for my niece.  It arrived early and it was adorable.  My niece just loved it and hasn't stopped wearing it.  The quality was great!
B00DG7F48M|4|These pants are comfortable, and the best thing about them is that pet hair doesn't cling to them (too much).
B00DHBT686|4|Feedback
B00BIUZBFU|3|a bit baggy. after alteration it was better, but it still wasn't my cup of tea. Buy at own risk.
B000N8Q4WW|5|bought them for my kids halloween costume they worked great they have been used for along time now and they are still going color didnt fade out much after all the washing they have been though
B00HYHUI68|4|nice thick shirt- good color
B008LWXQ1E|3|I bought 3 in different colors. For some reason, wine 28's are way smaller than grey or blue. Apart from that, the others are great. Fit a little tighter than my Levis slim
B000EXT66W|4|The T is an &#34;anvil&#34; preshrunk T shirt that is a good t shirt the time it took was real quick!!
B0046ED724|5|It is a very well made shirt . I read all the reviews and I normally wear a small so got the medium and it fits perfect :-)
B003GOY73S|5|Great seller answered my questions promptly and quickly.  Just wanted the cape and could not find the right fabric to make one.  But all parts are well made and sized as listed.
B00ENGRHJO|4|Probably my fault... Extra large is very wide.... I  went by a customer review....
B001D05Z88|4|i buy this product because it is offer by kenneth Cole, i think that this product do what i mena to do
B0064YYBC4|4|Great fit and very comfortable and lightweight undergarment that smoothes appearance of outer garments. My one complaint would be that the garment does not provide firm support in the stomach area. There is underwire bra support. Will use occasionally for smoother looks but will be buying spanx for more dress control where stomach/midriff is a concern.
B000JIMFT2|3|Too small
B00BLA34RO|5|Very comfortable, easy to wear. Nice fit when walking and sitting. Highly recommend.
B00BS08DY6|2|I bought a few of these with the intention to give them to my bridesmaids because they're the exact same color as their dresses. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sleeves are super awkward, and they're pretty big. I tried one on and it was very bulky. I usually wear a 4-6.  I really wish I liked these, but I'll be sending them back.
B00EDOA95U|5|This is a nice well made shirt.  It fits as expected.  The color is true to the online color and it perfect.  My wife loved it.
B007VEPG66|5|In wore this t-shirt around the house the Sunday I got it.  My husband noticed at dinner and said &#34; hey where is mine?&#34; I decided to get this one for me...hehe.  The sizing is standard mens.  I am 4'10&#34; and 110 lbs and I got a small.  It fits lose.  I like the loser fit with my t-shirts.  The short sleeves are a little long on me compared to a womens shirt but I don't mind.  The material is supper soft.  Its a keeper!!!
B0056B0OAY|5|I was skeptical to order this skirt, given the very low price but went ahead and ordered.  I was very pleased with the product!  I took the advice of other customers about ordering 1 size up because the skirt runs small and I'm glad I did!  I normally wear a small and I ordered a medium and it fits perfect.  For reference - I am 5'1'' and 115 pounds.  The skirt is a great stretchy material that is easy to move around in and doesn't make me look like a penguin when I walk.  It's also a very appropriate length for the office.  I went back and ordered one in every color.
B00PLHGL6E|5|Daughter loves it!
B000W5OTX2|4|Very cute costume.  My son is large for his age.  He's 8 and a half months and wearing 18 month clothing.  This BEARLY fits.  Was going to make an ewok costume but got lazy and just went with it as it is.  It's cute.  When he realizes he's wearing it though he tries to take it off.
B00EZ477CQ|5|love this just the size are too big well for me but I dont care and I wear it
B00LVPJMUC|5|The mix of cotton and stretch fabric make these jeans extremely comfortable.  They hold their shape and shrink very little after washing and drying in the clothes dryer.  Great color too very similar to the Wrangler 936 Slim Fit Antique wash jeans.
B00PJXAF30|3|could´t really tell the right size with the chart and ordered too big
B00331559O|4|Fits wide hips well because it has some stretch. Rear stitching design is flattering.  Lightweight, versatile, easy care, wrinkle & stain resistant. I love the fabric!!  Good for outdoors, travel or work. Of course that fact that it's a skort adds a lot   to its practicality. I would have added an inner drawstring for an even better custom fit.
B00M51PD6I|5|my daughter looks absolutely gorgeous in this dress! highly recommend it!
B002YT2IJQ|5|This robe is very soft and warm. I have washed it twice and it did very well.<br /><br />I do intense workouts in the afternoons at times. I really enjoy taking a warm shower afterward and then putting this robe on. It's comforting and warm and just perfect.<br /><br />As with any fluffy bathrobe, this isn't necessarily a slimming item and I do find that it makes me look like a giant care bear. But it's a comfy robe, so that's not necessarily a bad thing!!!<br /><br />This robe does everything I wanted it for and more, so I'm giving it 5 stars.
B00JQ3SOH8|1|Short and im average length. Very bad choice<br />Another dress from the same store was longer so no standard length available.. It seems to be left for luck
B008L5F1LY|5|My hubby had some pretty old and ugly ties, these are fun and stylish.  Some are a little loud, but fun for those special occasions.
B00MEE6WUW|5|great shirt  color size  and washs great
B00J0S36YU|4|The shoulders fall down somewhat so it will be hard to wear with a regular bra without using tape!
B00CPJTU8M|5|They fit perfectly<br />She loves them<br />They are comfortable<br />She is 16 and 5 foot tall<br />The crazy color is what she wanted
B00K0TSR1K|3|Altho better quality than Hanes and FOTL, it's not the same quality as the Kirkland Signature Crew Neck T's, which, frankly, baffles me! I purchased the V-necks because I was so impressed with the Crew Necks I bought a few weeks ago--amazingly beefy fabric, great fit, very well made. The V-necks arrived a couple of days ago, I put them through the wash and am wearing for the first time today. Not overly excited here. Altho the fabric feels a little softer to the touch (than the Crew Necks), it feels noticably thinner, which is a huge disappointment. The cut also seems bigger and looser than the Crew Neck. I'm no longer a thin guy, so for these to hang loose on me is saying something. I don't want a lot of T-shirt bagginess under my shirt, it looks sloppy--wish I would have ordered Medium. All in all, I'll just stick with Kirkland's Crew Neck T's.
B000A2KB7U|4|fits good considering he didnt get to try them on and I ordered them from 8 states away - he said the denim wasn't cheap (not to thin)<br />and the fit was gtood - I'm happy
B000K3M9GA|5|Great!
B0038JSF16|5|Perfect quality , I recommended it. Very warm.
B001L97SEK|5|My boyfriend loves this hoodie and wears it all the time!
B009QVV594|2|Ordered the bronze color, very orange in person.
B00B5W831A|5|My wife likes these jean.  We shop for them when we can.  It's nice to be able to get them from Amazon.
B007KJ37IG|4|The clothes are a great quality and look even better in person. Disappointed to receive the wrong sizes... 12 month top and 18 month bottom. Nothing was available for exchange.
B005FYKXFS|5|The shirt is made of good quality and arrived very fast. Also the graphic looks really nice on the T-shirt so I was very pleased with that. I ordered a medium but it looks like a large, maybe it will shrink in the wash. But I don't mind a larger T-shirt even if it doesn't shrink. I am very pleased with my purchase. I do recommend if you are a fellow sons of anarchy lover like me.
B00FC1SOSM|5|I bought this suit for Hawaii.  I'm 52, in decent shape, but still not wanting to wear a bikini and show off all of my imperfections.  This suit was PERFECT!  It was sexy LIKE a bikini without actually BEING a bikini!  It showed just enough skin without showing all of my flaws.  It was the perfect choice for Hawaii!  I can't wait to wear it again!
B00FLQVS04|2|the fit was fine, but I thought from the picture that it was more of a demi bra..pretty lace but I did not like the style..so  I gave it awaw
B001PIHO0U|4|I ordered 3 pairs of shorts from Amazon(also got Danksin womens cotton bermuda shorts and Russel cotten jersey gym shorts). The Champion shorts were the best of the three. Seem like a good value for the money
B00GJ3F3XG|5|Very cute design!<br />I am really impressed with the fit and the material. Fits great and looks especially great on.
B00AE0FDK8|5|Everything was as advertised. Price is great and service was fast and reliable. Would recommend it to anybody including friends.
B00MHFNT0Y|5|Fits great, and color is rich and vibrant.  Has nice sparkle accent which is difficult to see in photo.  Love it!!!
B00AWB3EK0|1|Impossible to wear. Does not have hooks in lower tab
B00NKXCSBI|1|Don't waste your money. the material is super cheap, it has no elastic, the straps are over stretched. terrible top.
B00EOM0WXK|5|Super cute, well made. The colors are bright and exactly like they are pictured. The fabric is soft.
B0024K9X8Y|5|Feels great and looks great.
B00FOGIHH8|5|Loved all my Carter's raincoats....size 4T purchased and fits with a little room to grow.  Gets many compliments on how cute he looks!
B00EN64148|5|I am very much impressed with this line of underwaer and have bought several pair.
B000WAWH68|5|Made for a great gag gift for secret Santa. I did not actually wear it or anything so my review won't be helpful if you are curious about comfort. My guess would be its pretty damned uncomfortable.
B00JEXE5X2|5|Soft Colors and feminine. Love the quality and the material.
B00657A2DM|5|Gift for my boyfriend, he reallly loved it and it was super soft and comfortable!! I recommend. Great gift for a guy.
B00CH6U708|3|This is a nice sweater, thought there's not much texture to the material.  Had ordered the light orange, and while it's a flattering color, the material was just too thin to feel comfortable wearing this without another sweater over top.  Decided to return.
B00DU7JSVC|4|Good quality and material used. Classy but yet not too exaggerated. Would definitely get more in the near future. Not my first and surely won't be my last. Worth the price.
B003WISYRI|5|Perfect
B00ZP6WYMQ|3|i ordered size S, and it's more like a size M honestly. I normally wear XS/bra size 32a/b and this would probably fit someone with bra size 34b/c or larger. I had to sew mine in. Shipping was quick though, and the lace is very nice. Note that the clasp is a weird brown colour and very obviously plastic, and that you can't adjust the straps any (they could have been half the length for me, but you can sew them shorter).
B0084DCEKE|5|Excelente
B006YL7N4K|4|it fits kind of small so if you have a big butt, forget about it.<br />i personally loved it very much.
B005QEOSX0|5|Great quality and holds cards in an easy access way
B00N39VH16|3|My fiancé said: This is nice but the material is thinner than expected & the dress isn't very flattering on bigger upper arms.
B00CIAHYH2|3|The dress is very cute the only problem is it extremely see through so you have to wear leggings. I want to wear it as a dress so I will possibly be a slip.
B0007UF1YI|3|i ordered a small, hoping it would be ok for a US size 6 female, but it was a lot bigger than i expected.
B00FPYVP78|3|I got this to wear over my summer dresses at work and it will serve it's purpose. I'm 5'2&#34; and about 130lbs, the front looks good but the back is a little higher up my back than I'd like.  There were two very small holes I'm not pleased with but they are small and they material is very thin (which is what I wanted) so I guess for the price I paid I'm satisfied.
B00C4NV6AO|5|Fantastic hawaiian rayon shirt<br />still not shown to my friends on the beach!<br />unfortunately I asked the wrong size but, better bigger than too small to fit!<br />;oD
B00NM3LLNC|2|This product arrived early today - with packaging and &#34;instructions&#34; in Chinese. The outfit is too small, and because it is from China, returning it will be cost-prohibitive. The sizing may be accurate for a smaller Asian Child, but not for my granddaughter who wears a 5T in most every outfit.  I wish I had shopped at the Disney store. At least their products can be returned!
B001A40LMM|3|The waist is fine but it was far baggier than I expected. Going to have to get it taken in
B00MCK329W|5|Great dress.  Nice coverage on top.  I get a lot of compliments on this simple but classy dress.  Is great for travel.  Easy to dress up or down with accessories.
B00C0VIVSK|5|I bought this for an upcoming trip to Alaska (way ahead of time mind you) but it seems just the ticket for my needs.  Not taking very many cards with me so I can fit all I need into this neat little carrier, which will also fit nicely into a very small purse I bought.  Going small!  Love the print too.  Too cute.
B00LURXF6S|5|Perfect!  The material is very soft and it's warm to wear.
B0045OQ6WI|5|This silk is so rich and thick and colors are so true and beautiful.  All of this series of scarves sold by Dahlia are soooo nice.  I bought a few to have available as instant gifts.
B00VFCRMC6|5|Beautiful dress.. high quality thick material.  I received a lot of compliments wearing this dress.  I did go by the size chart & ordered one size up.  Normally wear 0-2, x-small but ordered a small 4-6 & it fit perfectly.  Originally could not decide which color to try but glad I chose red.  It was a vibrant not washed out color & I think that is what made the dress really stand out.  Would highly recommend & may try another color even though it would be the same style dress.  Some dresses you can get by with different colors & not be noticeable but this dress is so unique, that is why I hesitate.  I have also experimented by ordering other Asian manufacturer's dresses.  I have had some that were definitely not good.  I am going back to mainly Miusol & VfEmag dresses, which both for me have been great quality & price.
B00Y5646EQ|4|It's nice but way to small<br />I'm size XS and I order M
B00ISRC2CG|5|they are as expected!!!
B005M4L9A4|5|A requirement for anybody who loves the show.
B010Q7AJOS|1|Started to fray after just first wash. Very disappointed in the quality.
B004RDQWEE|2|Bought these for my husband, they definitely run too small.  Padding seems good if they had fit.
B00F4N3D7U|5|I matched this watch with my scrub on christmas day and just as usual compliments, compliments here and there, some even had asked me for it, of course not i just got it. ...lol The size is just right big and legible, for my everyday use as a nurse. Plastic strap though, hope it will hold up after a while. I have tons of watches so i will use this sparingly so it wont wear out on time.
B00NLI226S|5|I bought these pants for my fiance and she loves them! They are long on her (she is 5'3) but she says they are very comfortable!
B0000867ML|2|Not as supportive as it looked.  To loose fitting.
B00IN8V4RO|5|Very nice.!!!!!!!
B00F8R6N88|4|I like this product a lot and it was just expected. I chose four stars because although the product is what I expected, the color was different than what is on the screen. But that is to be expected when shopping online. I love how warm  the leggings are. They will be great for the wintertime! :) Overall I am happy with my purchase.
B0009MZYEQ|5|Recommended by my husband's podiatrist, these are unbelievable socks -- very sturdy.  Because they are on the expensive side, they make wonderful special birthday and Christmas gifts.  My husband always loves getting them !
B007KF1U98|5|It was worth the money!
B006ZU6H1A|5|Great fit ! Great Dress !!! I love it !! The best part is that they are so cheap ! i wish they had more colors to choose from i would buy one in every color !!!
B004I371ZC|5|I ordered this adorable beanie to complete my halloween costume! However, the one I received looked moderately different from the one shown in the picture. I immediately got into contact with the seller, who provided excellent costumer and was able to resolve everything. I like this beanie because of the soft inner lining and the adorable raccoon face! I would recommend this beanie and the seller to all of my friends and family looking for a fun, warm beanie!
B00CDFSKP2|5|Received the dress today from FEDEX.<br /> I was speechless when I tried it on.<br />It's ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I have no complains. The medium fitted me so well. I'm about 5&#34;2 and weighs 96 lbs. Hem falls 2 inches below my knees. Loved the fabric and design even better than the photo. I can't wait to wear this on the 15th this month for my pinning ceremony.<br /><br />Thank you!
B00LFV6YEO|5|I love this shirt fits like it should and the screen print is awesome
B00BXX2BNW|5|we own 2 of these and love it.
B0072JAMSM|4|The length is a bit long, but otherwise the fit is good.  I ordered Medium, and I'm 150 lbs, 5'8&#34;.
B005V77KM8|4|Good product, but I had a small problem with the shipment.  The shipper's customer service department went out of their way to gain my satisfaction.
B00KG79RS8|5|I bought this for my daughter following the measuring guidelines.  It fit beautifully.  It is a lovely dress!  The fabric is great quality with a little stretch to it.  It was lined and the side zipper is easy to handle.  We didn't buy the Lindy Bop peticoat as she didn't want that much fluff but bought a less ruffly one instead.  It's perfect.
B004O9U4C2|2|Not very thick and doesn't look like the picture.  Should have bought the more expensive one.
B001MZ264K|5|Beautiful dress. At first I thought it was too young looking for a 50 year old, but I added a white shrug and it looks great. Can not wait to wear it on vacation in Hawaii.
B0062ONRZ8|5|Orvis-quality materials, fit and finish ... a great mid-weight shirt in a classic pattern that is perfect for fall or winter
B001XON4BY|4|Great inexpensive way to keep your hats in shape.
B00F8NS5OM|5|Love the old school look to the sweater. PERFECT!
B00KGGPBVG|5|These are an affordable alternative to hannah anderson pjs for kids. they are slightly less thick, but equally soft and should last a long time. this is the second pair I have purchased for my kids.
B004AW9TX8|5|These are the most comfortable scrubs I have ever wore. I only wear WonderWink scrubs now... You can't go wrong.
B003IBPR4C|4|The material was a bit thinner than I expected; however, we live in the midwest, so we planned on putting a sleeper on under the costume anyway.  We were able to put two layers of clothes on under the costume and it wasn't too snug on him.  The length was perfect and he is 13 months old.
B00D6PZUAQ|5|Just as ordered - son loved it.
B00DR90EQQ|5|It looks and fits well for my son. He loves to wear it.
B00CJYJHC2|5|Perfect! My daughter loves her first pair of underwear!
B00631VFM2|5|The gown is a little big, but I love it.  It is just what I wanted - good quality too.  Thanks!
B00FPSX75W|3|I'm not sure if this is a recent development, but like another reviewer, the black pants are almost see-through sheer.<br /><br />I bought these pants to be able to go to lunchtime yoga without having to change my pants, but I can't wear them around the office given how they are almost see-through. I'll have to look into the return policy, because I'm not sure I want to keep them.
B00JQSR1SQ|4|Fit & length are true to size
B00EZUMZ2C|5|Great kimono - light, thin, felt nice and satin-y. I couldn't examine it since it was a gift, and I won't know how it holds up, but it looked pretty good! Glad I bought it.
B00EP6SZWK|1|I was excited about the price of these scarves and to get to wear them but sadly I have never received these scarves and I ordered them over a month ago! Very disappointed!
B00KHCPPEC|4|This is a cool shirt that fit as expected. Colors are not as vivid as in picture but it doesn't detract too much from the overall look of the shirt. Not a very soft material but great for the price.
B00PA8ISH4|2|Really good quality pants, but, the size is incorrect. I use 32 and based on this pants I should buy like a 36 to fit me, but then I am guessing that the thighs and legs will be too loose.
B001ELL6LG|5|A great bra for large breasted woman like myself. Comfortable fit and uplifting! Liked it so much went back and ordered two more
B0031HKS4C|5|Works and looks great...she loves it :)
B00NGS6OY4|4|Very nice flattering yoga pants and super comfortable but after only 1 wash, the seam in the crotch was already coming undone.  A easy fix with a needle and thread but be aware
B00SB6AHV2|5|Wonderful.  Thin and cool.  And soft.
B008QJ9BVG|5|Couldn't be happier with this shirt, it was exactly what I was looking for.  This was my favorite of all the Rise Against shirts I looked at.  Thanks!
B00HQBQTVU|5|This was a bday gift for my daughter in law.  She said the color and fit is perfect.
B00FZ0MVA2|3|Not enough room for business cards or club cards and no change holding compartment. Not even enough room if you have multiple credit cards and a debit card. It looks fine and is still in good condition after several months though.
B003GXFTG8|4|Very nice quality belt for the money
B007X546EQ|5|The scarf was even cuter when I got it than it looked online! A great buy for any scarf lover!
B00ACIFT92|5|The fit is goo and so is the quality.  These wash well and retain shape.  I will buy these again.
B000GL1EGW|5|Costume is great!  The XL was the perfect fit for my fiance, 6'4&#34; and 220 lbs.  The waist was too big but the costume has a drawstring to adjust.  Was very pleased with the outcome!
B00DYRQD7U|2|Bands around wrists and waist TOO BIG
B00B8TUWZK|3|Good quality, though the color is a much lighter gray than appears in the photo. The writing is somewhat hard to read as a result.
B008UDWZ7A|5|LOOKS GREAT ON MY HEAD! I like built quality, the logo is a patch that's sewn on, and gives it a 3D effect. Great snapback for the price!
B00UZHSVT0|1|Must be junior size because this is my normal size I wear and they are small
B00GGXCIUU|2|Update: Seriously concerned about the authenticity of the leather. After closer inspection, the material feels (and smells) like polyurethane or something similar. I have other leather jackets and it's defenetly doubious.<br />(Older review): It's lightweight, looks great and feels true to size. The leather seems very nice also, it's soft and thin. The craftmanship is very good also. I'm 5'10, average sized, 180 pounds. Not too skinny, not too muscular. I sent my measures to the seller and they sent me a Medium jacket, which fits quite well, don't know if they made modifications on it though after receiving my measures. Only thing i'd wish the jacket was a little shorter and more snug on the shoulders, but I guess I'll have to do my part on the gym, just 'cause I like how shorter and really snug jackets looks on me. Very good purchase though. It's a classic.
B009VNOTU4|5|I bought my wife a powershot s100 for Christmas and she wanted a sturdy case to protect it, we looked at a couple of the soft cases but she was adamant that she wanted some that offered more protection.<br /><br />We sprung for this case and it was exactly what we needed, it was still small enough that it could fit in her bag but still offered enough protection with all the stuff she carries in there (a whole different conversation for another time)<br /><br />Love the case, great deal and it came pretty fast!
B00FKTL6KE|5|She's a plunge. I did wear a thin tank under this top in order to make it acceptable office attire.<br />Love the fit. If you have some lumps... go a bit larger. Lumps will show in this stretch blouse.
B00A9XJ14Y|3|The size and color is good, the sleeves work fine too, but at the start when I closed it the plastic locking part would not let go!<br />Finally after getting frustrated having to put my thumbnail in the crease to wedge it open, I whacked against a counter in my kitchen and it has worked fine since.  Probably mine was just the exception....I manage to get those, but all is well that ends well.
B00FADLYS4|2|I don't like this Jacket, the look that I see on line,  is not as the same as when you  Purchases it and the fits  are small...
B002AHE886|5|A great bargain ! The hat is extremely comfortable. I could wear it all day, it feels that good. I highly recommend it.
B0001YS124|5|Three pair all fit the same. I've only worn one pair and good so far.
B00BHILJEK|4|They look great and pull in your tummy! At the end of a work day, they get a little uncomfortable for me (but I am a size 16). Others will love them!
B00N9NBIZ6|3|Very pretty dress. Runs small though.
B000UBNF7Y|2|I guess it is good, because it was cheap, but def not as good as I thought it was going to be. I am not a big fan of the hinge on the side and the fact that it dosen't really close perfectly.
B00I6KSBFC|5|I ordered the dress larger to make site it would fit my daughter. It was every thingi hooted it would be for her.
B008X27OPG|3|Great buy
B007V03KEU|5|Still pretty after a year of wear and washes! LOVE Levi's!
B00DQBBG94|5|Very light weight, comfortable and is perfect for the hot summer days or nights.
B004BH7OVG|5|Amazon rating system is designed by who know what. I'm being asked to describe how a handkerchief &#34;fits&#34;. It fits well, but is too tight around my ankles... What are they expecting. Maybe amazon should get a human involved.
B005TNJB26|5|I got this bag to paint the gears silver for a silver and white ball. These painted very well and will give my outfit the look I've been wanting.
B005T5S1AW|2|For a guys shirt…its not very long. I like buying mens clothes because they fit better and are a bit longer than women's clothes. I really love NBC but this shirt sucks.
B003PBTIDG|5|Really like these Jeans - sometimes it can be a gamble with buying clothes over the internet - but very pleased to say that these Jeans arrived as advertised. Will definitely be purchasing again.
B000JFF5SI|5|I cannot say enough good things about these mittens.  I had high expectations and these mittens met them.  My 3-year-old and 22-month-old kids stay warm and dry - no more cold wrists and mittens that fall off!  The large thumb opening makes it easy to get the mittens on.  The toddler sizes have a nice Velcro strap on them to help keep them from sliding down little hands.  My kids have such tiny wrists, so the straps don't tighten around them as much as I'd like them to.  The elastic up by the elbow helps, though.  Great for toddlers.  I wish I had bought them sooner.  I will definitely buy the next size when needed.
B0024DBIK2|5|I bought based on recommendations, and was not disappointed.  The shawl and gift scarf were both Dusty Coral color; and the scarf can also be used as a light weight shawl.  Beautiful color, and just the perfect gift for my daughter's birthday.  They were very nicely packaged also.
B00KW3OCMC|5|Delivered on time and it was exactly what I expected.
B000V9OG9Q|5|WOULD RECOMMEND THIS OUTLET TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO RECEIVE TOP NOTCH APPAREL AT A REASONABLE PRICE.
B00092OXJ8|3|The picture is very misleading.  It looks like you are buying pants that can be converted into shorts, but that is not the case.  These are just pants.  They look okay, and seem comfortable enough, but I was disappointed to find out when they were delivered that they are not convertible pants.
B00D48X9OY|4|I bought this to be a work shirt. Thankfully I am a cashier so wearing a cami underneath this is enough to keep me work appropriate. It also looks like it could be cute enough to wear on a casual day off. It fits as expected and hopefully it is more durable than it feels.
B007NZU8YI|4|It would have been 5 stars if the quality of the material was a little better.  Other than that, it was exactly as advertised.  Great product, decent price, shipping was fast.
B003021UBS|5|Very nice dickeys.  So useful in cold weather.  Colors are perfect for winter wear.  They add such a nice, layered look under sweaters.
B00C9V23CG|5|Genie bras are the most comfortable bras I have every worn. Once you try them no other brand will do.
B000EPP58S|5|I have worn this every day since it was delivered! I am 23 weeks pregnant with twins with a short torso and I am feeling so much more comfortable wearing this than my bras, even with a bra extender in place. Sitting at my desk, walking around, in general I have so much less pain. It's amazing. The back does ride up a little, but I think that's how it generates belly support. The only complaint I have is that I wish the bra cups were lined (it's currently winter) but I am using the removable liners from another bra when I wear this. Debating buying another color to get through the next 15 weeks!
B00DOS3RFU|5|Another gift that I ordered. The size ordered was perfect. And the young lady that received it was very happy.
B007XFKBB8|2|The materials on thr costume were of great quality, but the design did not make sense. Their is no zipper,  so the outfit should be stretchy throughout.  But instead, everything was stretchy besides the gold belt, which meant I could not fit it over my hips. My measurements are 36&#34;, 27&#34;, 37&#34;. The costume would have fit if I could have gotten the non - stretchy waistband over my hips. I was disappointed and had to send it back,  so it was pretty disappointing.
B008FYGJZ8|5|I really like these tan slacks and wish I had another pair in a dark green.  They are lightweight corduroy, and extremely comfortable, fit well..
B006C9EENW|5|Buy this line at least one , if not 2 sizes bigger than usual. Fantastic shirt, beautiful portrayal of skull and Roses. Love my shirt!!
B006JGGCKG|5|Fashionable right size is my favorite type I love it<br />If more and more discounts will be able to choose
B00NJEF5CC|1|16 inch sleeves on a medium! Does not look like picture.
B00HXD8GJ4|5|These pants are very comfortable, an excellent buy.
B005ANLRT0|5|The Star Wars belt buckle has great sturdy quality, exactly as described. It is well made and very reasonably priced.
B003R9FEES|2|There wasn't enough poof to it, even after I shaped it. Ended up having to purchase another at a store.
B005RS4ZGU|5|The large was slightly too tight in my chest. I returned it and got the XL. The XL fit great. The XL honestly was like a L in my opinion.
B005DIMVHY|1|waaaay too small for a size XXL. I measured it at 48&#34;... I expected XXL to be 50-52. I sent it back because of size only. Quality and style were exactly as described. Would love to have one that fits, but I'm too wary of the sizing rto try again.
B005QR8PAE|2|Love the shirt but way too small
B00CIYFRTA|2|I don't know if I could exchange this because is way too small. I don't get it I am a Large it says one size up so I choose XL. It fits really tight and it makes my hips pop in a weird way so you could tell I am wearing something for my butt. It's not flattering at all maybe if I get a bigger size it will be better.
B009Z7FDKQ|1|I bought this slip to wear under a dress that tends to cling to my skin. I'm 5'3 and 130lbs. I'm quite fit, but after having a kiddo my tummy area has developed a little pouch that I'm very self conscious about. I saw this &#34;compression&#34; slip and thought, perfect! Now I can wear my dress to a wedding we have coming up. The only 2 things this slip compressed was my boobs, that's it. Below that it's like wearing a long t-shirt. DOES NOT COMPRESS ANYTHING ELSE! i don't know if it's just me, but I was hoping it would help my tummy area. I will be returning this useless thing asap.
B00JJAFLVK|5|Love this brand, quality ties for good prices
B00E6MRBU0|5|Love them! Fit perfectly and are really comfortable.
B005P17UCU|5|Nice fit and looks great.
B004Y4ULVQ|3|I love these and my son did too but they were too large for him. The size 4 we bought looks like it's more like a size 6 (and I double checked the size inside the actual underwear). I'm hoping they shrink a little when I wash them otherwise it will be a couple of years before my son can wear them.
B003IHMJFG|3|They fit well in the waist and legs.  The rise is a lot lower than I would like. You risk exposure of your natal cleft and in the front it squeezes my gentlemen sausage.
B00IE0ZFP8|3|When I got my shirt, it only had three buttons, not like the picture. I'm sick of ordering things that are not as pictured. Color differences are one thing, but buttons? Fits as expected.
B009L2YDN8|5|I usually dont wear US Polo Assn. but when I saw this sweater with the black and pink stripes with the matching hat I fell in love. The sweater not only looks cute on but it fits comfortably that I loved it so much I purchased the Teal and grey matching set as well.
B00AKMX7US|5|I love the SWAK cami's they make me feel on trend, but still comfy! The fabric is awesome, never wrinkles, and is flawless. LOVE!
B00M6XA0VI|1|it looked weird and poorly made. I sent it back.
B0094MEHKO|5|Love it
B00KSFBTWU|5|I LOVE my new sweater! we had an ugly sweater party at work and I have received so many laughs and compliments on this sweater. I bought a size larger than I usually wear since you never know when you buy something online. It ended up being a bit too big, but I'd rather have a size too big than too small. it kind of added to the &#34;ugliness&#34;. I will keep this sweater and wear it every year! it seems like it'll stand up to the annual abuse, great quality!
B00PWL5R3C|5|My sister loved this as a Christmas present!! Fantastic form fitting band!
B00PDJTPWC|5|Love these!
B00AEZLMWG|4|But it shrunk after the first wash. It didn't shrink too much though. I got it for my son and got one size bigger so he could wear it longer and now it fits him perfectly.
B00IRRRNEO|5|Antony Morato makes great lightweight blazers with a bit of convention mixed with a bit of cutting edge and all at a reasonable price.<br />Dig their clothing line and look forward to Amazon carrying more.
B009KY1TYI|3|They were ok
B003ZW4TF2|5|This was a Christmas gift for a nephew and it came quickly, as described.  It was a good quality product, great service and priced in my budget. I would order from them again.
B00D3YQNQK|2|returned it.  the fleece did not look like in the picture and it was way too small.
B00N4OTVUE|5|I ordered it the largest size and it fits perfect she loves it quality materials warm and looks as pictured and it got here in time for Christmas beautiful love it and so does my daughter they also sent a cute pair of socks :) Thank You !!!
B009HC9Y2W|4|I ordered this for my boyfriend, He usually wears a medium and that's what I ordered. It is a great shirt, he loves it. The only problem is the fit is a little too tight for his taste.
B00DIXLUIC|2|Not the greatest cotton...the cotton does not feel great to the touch as marketed. Also the fit is too loose.
B000P55140|3|The watch is very nice looking and seems good quality for price. However it is actually too large to fit a small wrist. Looks awkward.
B006RD9EMO|5|Great buy!!
B00JGH75AQ|4|Granddaughter really liked this swimsuit.  Good material and bright colors.
B00NS636KE|5|This is a perfect boat hat which is why I bought it. It seems like great quality for the price.
B00IALNSZU|2|Too small, not the quality I hoped for and sent it back.
B00CUM2L5S|2|I gave two stars for this product because I didn't wear it is too large ..<br /> I usually wear medium to large. But because I have read the reviews and the ppl complain about the size as they said is too large I decided to buy smallest size which was S small . When I got it was  big, fit for the ppl who wear x larg<br />So  if you wear smal or medium  this proudct no good for you , and if you wear large to x large this proudct good for you if you pick small size. .
B00O82XVUW|5|Seem to run a little small.  Warm and fuzzy, my son said they were comfortable.  I believe they might have shrank a little more with washing.  I would buy these again in a bigger size.
B00JUJJFR6|5|The material is thin, I was expecting typical sweat pant material but was happily surprised when they arrived. They will be great in the summer and early fall. The screenprinting may not hold up to repeated washings. Great value for the overall product.
B00198P09I|5|Highest quality and very very comfortable.  Only brand I'd ever wear.  No show with lower waisted pants is a plus.
B00EY7USFC|5|Very attractive and nice quality hat.
B00DDVV64M|3|mmm it's ok... didn't like it that much but i will use it under some dresses so it's ok.
B005H3BSUG|5|Bought as a gift. She adored this hat
B00T33X016|5|Just what I was looking for so I was pleased it's such great quality. I knew what I was looking for and this is perfect.
B00KILHAHC|4|Quick delivery.
B005YV01WM|5|My husband wore a black vest all winter, so I decided he needed a couple more colors.  Originally ordered Columbia vests, but they lacked the drawstring at the bottom.  He was very happy with this one instead of the more expensive vests.
B00Q7T3MO4|5|Amazing quality.
B00963QI2G|1|cheap. the zipper broke the night of my birthday. would return it but it has been a while since my purchase.
B00QTEGUDW|5|Love the color, light chiffon silk scarf with beautiful butterfly design!
B00XMS3QFI|5|Beautifully made and great for  summer.  Since Im familiar w sizing issues on imported clothing I sized up to 5 times.  I'm about a s-m and got 2xx.  It worked!!!:)
B00FWJU3T2|5|I love this comfortable and casual shirt.  Goes with shorts or long pants and very functional.  Very well made and sizing just about right.  Would recommend.
B00STT2GZG|3|Would be ok but ordered a larger size based on reviews and it was HUGE. It also didn't seem very tailored, it looked boxy to me.
B00XPDPWMU|5|Great purchase.
B004CRTYXQ|3|Nice material weight.  Petite length way too long compared to other brand names.  Waist to crotch length was more in line with a regular women's size, subsequently the waist band flips over.  Would love to see NYDJ offer a true women's plus petite jean in a straight leg cut in something larger than an 18.
B00ACIGVJ4|5|Will buy again
B00AW83K2U|5|I read all the reviews and had to buy this; It's perfect!  I wear it out with my son, I wear it to work, I can wear it for drinks, etc.  I'm about 5'7 and thick (165).  I ordered a large and love it.  I highly recommend it!  It's super warm, too.
B00CCWXAC4|5|My wife loves this little hat for walking our dog she looks quite cute i it too. thumbs up!
B008AEEG8U|3|While this shirt does fit me quite well it is much smaller than pictured (i.e. the model must be wearing a Large). It is quite short (although I do have a long torso) so do not expect the shirt to look or fit anything like it does on the model/in the picture... unless of course you are a size Small and order a Large. I ordered a Large and it fits just like a normal 3/4 sleeve t-shirt.
B000RKA5QW|5|The shorts fit perfectly.  They look good and living in Calif they come in handy.
B001H0FUBQ|1|I have purchased Levi's throughout the years, very loyal customer and really liked the jeans. My most recent purchases, we're talking in the last 12 months, are already in the trash because of the very poor quality materials being used. I even received a new pair for Christmas 2014 and they are already trashed, belt loops rip off, the corners where the pockets are attached to the jeans, ripped, both sides. I do not recommend Levi's and today just purchased some comfy, hopefully reasonably durable, Wranglers from TSC .
B0039824PY|5|Best baby socks I've found.
B00DMWQJ58|5|these were perfect for a last minute flapper costume.  I am 5&#34;4&#34; and 135 pounds with smallish hands - ring size 5.5.  The hands and arms fit fine for me and the material is stretchy.  It might be too small for some one with bigger hands and arms.
B001RKKNQI|3|Product is average. Good for a couple family or personal functions. It does the job but the hairs fall off to easily.
B0059DTPWC|3|It was a little big for a large and the texture of the outside of the sweatshirt was more fleece like than the ones I've bought in the past.
B008VEI5OU|1|I ordered a 36b, piece of crap couldn't even hook. Doesn't follow sizes correctly. Was so disappointed, had to change my whole outfit last minute
B00RE9FHSK|4|So beautiful. Felt like a princess. Beads fall really easily though.
B00IZ984N8|5|Best socks ever!  I bought the men's one because I liked the color and fit better.  No more blisters!
B0042LI4LA|5|I really do love it. Perfect fit and sun coverage. I will buy one more for my next trip.
B000SKLTJ8|5|MY HUSBAND HAS WORN THESE SOCKS AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM IN STORES. HE IS VERY PARTICULAR AND THESE SOCKS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE, LONG LASTING MATERIAL AND THE RIGHT LENGTH. WOULD BUY AGAIN.
B00SDTJZ6K|5|can't wait to wear it! fun!
B000Z9BMNK|5|Great...quick shipping
B0096GO2YO|4|Sometimes leather doesn't work for me. This was a larger capacity wallet than I originally thought, so I felt it was an excellent value for the price.
B00N1S7FSS|4|NICE
B0055TV8P2|5|excellent
B00EUDHVDC|5|I love it does the job!!!! My butt looks nice in jeans
B00F7VKU7A|5|Really liked the way it fit...
B000B91N6U|5|Looked awesome, added a little fake blood spatters and it was perfect.  Size runs a little large, though.
B000FEC8VA|3|The fit was really big, and the fabric gathers around the leg and butt. For the fabric to lay straight you need to go a size down.
B00PJ0487C|4|Very comfortable.
B0061HLWI0|5|Ok
B00KDK1L3M|3|I'm 5'6&#34; and have been on the hunt for non-capri yoga pants that don't also sweep the ground. My search continues.<br /><br />PS Other than the length, it's decent quality and should work for yoga.
B00BPEPZZK|3|We're currently in 10H so I ordered these.  They're marked as size 12H but they run small as they fit just like the 10H Dickies, just longer.  Keep that in mind when ordering.
B00VMP7GCW|4|They arrived in a timely manner and fit great
B00FXPSGR6|3|This is NOT a heavyweight sweatshirt. This is a MIDWEIGHT sweatshirt. FALSE ADVERTISING!!! If you don't need a heavyweight sweatshirt it seems to be nice quality. I would have returned it if my wife didn't wash it already.
B0053XF63K|5|Definitely pull it up from your feet.  I tried over the head and the Small is barely bigger than my neck!  But it's great for holding up pants that are too loose or tight, has good compression, and does not compress in the bust.  I wish it had more side/underarm coverage and maybe was an inch longer to cover the crotch- but otherwise it's perfect.  Ooh and I wish it came in some other colors like Jewel tones.
B005NYNW9O|5|I just bought a new one after buying one of these two years ago. It's sooooo comfortable, I can even sleep in it. Looking forward to my new one! It looks amazing under tee shirts and gives you the perfect lift without any wires.
B00PR0AO2C|5|Great fit
B00I03U676|1|This tank has soft fabric and is super comfy to wear! It's hard not to want to put it on everyday!
B00C6W8AAM|4|Received these, put them on, and never wanted to take them off again. The only thing is: they're supposed to be slightly less comfy and tuck in my tummy. They do not, since they run a bit large. I should have ordered a size smaller!
B008ACLMDO|4|I'm five foot one and weigh 172 lbs so I ordered the large. The fabric is very smooth and light. I had no struggles putting them on especially over my 17 inch calves. When I was running this morning, I noticed the back felt like it was shimmying down my backside. So I keep tugging to pull up the waist band. I'm curvy so maybe it's just the fact that I have an hourglass shape but my other tights don't ride down. I don't know if ordering a size medium would solve the problem.
B004CJ2RHO|4|These are my favorite kid socks- the no-skids never wear out and they fit the kids well.  My only complaint is the &#34;feature&#34; of these socks which is that they are all just slightly different.  It does make them easy to match, but when one is missing (which happens frequently with kids' socks) the other one becomes worthless.  I would prefer to have them all the same.
B000VO1FI6|3|I loved these socks on arrival, but when I took them out of the dryer, they were about 6 inches shorter than they were before with stubby toes - YIKES!!! I must confess that I never read the care instructions and had already thrown away the packaging, but a pair of socks that can't be washed and dried isn't very useful to me! Nevertheless, they started as over-the-knee socks, so there's still enough of them left to make them wearable.
B002B9S3ZC|4|The min top hat looks exactly the same as in the picture with black glitter all over it. The only down fall is that it isn't a hat with an open hole for your head its flat and the strap is suppose to go around your neck like a party hat. So I listened to one of the other reviews and took out the strap and purchased a skinny black headband which worked perfectly. I would recommend buying a really skinny one that will work in your hair because was a slight thick and the holes got a little bigger. Overall a good product and I got a lot of compliments.
B00OC0Q05S|5|Nice quality. Wish it had one more button.
B00Q22BRBQ|5|Great
B00KJ02J96|5|It's a solid good looking hat.
B00H3YUOP2|5|I love it, it fits perfectly , especially since it can stretch a bit at the waist.  I was unsure what size to purchase it so I read the reviews and went with XL since my pants size would be 12 or 13 depending on the material.  I'm 5'6.5 tall and I have sorta muscular legs, it was snug for me, hope this review can help someone else decide if they wanna buy this.
B00M2KL0FU|5|simplicity, strength, and style.
B00FRDK25S|5|I love these gloves, they are warm & soft.
B0042GSAEQ|5|Great socks. Plenty of complements of the pattern
B0048J0BW6|5|GREAT
B00DY7WVUI|5|Very cute
B00LN1WP8A|5|It was perfect.
B003WE9AJ8|4|These jeans fit true to size and look great. They are a bit wider in the leg than we expected though.
B0058GG0B4|4|Very nice and comfortable. Im very happy because the price is low but quality is good. :)<br />(Bought it to my 3 year old)
B002R0F7Q8|5|I have a 4 year old that weighs 42 lbs and is 43in tall. These shorts are perfect for wearing over her gymnastics leotard.  They are not skin tight so they look appropriate for her age.  In everyday clothing she wears some 4s but mostly 5s.
B00D8SLHIA|4|Coat is cozy warm, Hood is to large. Blocks my view when walking my dog. I have to constantly adjust the hood. However the price was great and I am able to be warm on my walks.
B007VMOEE8|5|Bought it for my son and he loves it. Looks pretty darn good to. He wears it every time we go out when the weather is bad. I'd recommend it to my friends and family for a good looking and inexpensive jacket to own.
B00K1KZ900|4|cute
B00KAWCJXO|5|My son loves it!
B007CFD6PW|1|The size did not fit properly and is very loose. Hesitatingly, I wore it on windy day. When I was walking to my office, it flew and got damaged beneath a car.
B00GJWLAFC|5|Ha, these were fun. Good gifts for people who think they don't want socks, but they'll relise this is a pretty great set.
B00U80R3PC|5|I absolutely love this tank top!! Exactly what I have been looking for!! Would definitely buy from this seller again
B003X1DCS0|5|I bought this for my husband, who is always cold in winter. He absolutely loves it! Wears it with the hood up to walk our pet outside in cold weather, and wears it to watch TV or read during the evenings. He said it's the best present ever! An added plus: our cat also loves it: curls up to sleep on it every night after we go to bed.
B0042YZ56E|3|This vest looked very nice when my son wore it, but after the first wearing, the part of the vest where it makes the \\"V\\" is ripped.  I would have expected better.  I have a number of vests for my son and I've never had this happen.
B00LCJAL66|5|Awesome my dad loved it!!
B0012M0TSS|1|This is about the prettiest bra I've ever owned and it made me look good too.   HOWEVER - have you ever had something on that just stabbed you in the side and you couldn't figure out where it was coming from? The inside on the right has something (rough material, whatever) that sticks me whether I'm moving or not. I looked and looked and couldn't find it. You can't feel it with your fingers. I put some fabric over the inside to cover whatever it was. To no avail. I tried everything I could think of but nothing ever fixed it. I am terribly disappointed now because I want to wear it but can't.
B00488C044|4|They are a bit snug at the top but other than that fit just fine
B00K3ZNI4W|5|Fit as expected
B00VJARR8I|5|really like it ,thank's
B00IUJU35K|5|This was a great dress for my 10 yo. Wish i would have ordered the next sz up though. This one fit fine, a little snug going down her chest area but the rest was perfect. She usually wears a girls sz 14 so I ordered her the large. Was too afraid the XL would be too big. Great material and put together nicely. Stones all attached and stayed in place. She's almost 5ft 2in and it fell just to the middle of her thighs. She's very tall for her age. Great dress though for the price, would buy from again.
B00FTKFMXG|5|Very happy with this hat. Well made, great fit and durable. Already in use. Highly recommend. Shipping was fast and everything was as promised.
B00CKLIF90|5|Just what I expected. A very comfy cute shirt. I would recommend this product. The color and shape is as pictured.
B00AA0ZNUM|5|i loved it
B008DZU8LK|1|extremely too small, can't even get it past my thighs
B00GT3JCLU|5|This is a great maxi. I wear it all the time. Lightweight and breathable - I love it.
B009FUF4WA|3|thot the cutting for junior size will not be big.<br />but turn out, the x-large is enormous for asians.<br /><br />but its a nice jacket. will monitor for other sizes available. its currently oos now
B004TUJKEE|1|There already ripping as soon as I put them on. I had to throw them away. Very poor quality in the fabric.
B00D7UX1YM|5|great
B004R1NTSI|3|Like it otherwise
B009RFKLX0|1|I purchased these for my 5 year old. Before they had even been washed, the perry sticker started to peel off. He was very disappointed.
B00180G8U2|5|Very Good.
B007PESS6C|5|very well
B004SWJG4M|5|These are great uniform shirts.  Fit as expected and good quality.
B00D3HER0G|5|I am familiar with this product and was glad to find these colors in a moderately priced 3-pack.  I like the product for comfort, fit and durability.  I will buy this again.
B00JXEKV58|3|I liked it, But the length to short.
B00EFVNGHE|4|ok
B00IO31O4Q|5|Very Nice.  Fits well.
B004LIYYMW|5|I LOVE IT SO MUCH
B0130O6FW4|5|So very cute! This will be perfect for my little guys first day of school. Felt appliqué is just precious. Ses to run true to size.
B00BY1FFZ4|2|I was very disappointed with this top. The material is light and of poor quality. There is no liner. I returned it.
B00OZJXL3A|5|Ordered them for my girls (8+9). I wish I'd of ordered one for myself too! So cute and warm!!!
B005CJMD54|5|I'll start off with saying that I am a 33x32 muscular build. My thighs are larger because I squat and deadlift a lot, so finding the perfect fitting pair of pants has always been hard.<br /><br />Waist: The waist fit perfect. I measured right before purchasing these, I measured 33&#34;, ordered 33&#34;, and they fit perfectly. Not too snug, just enough room left.<br /><br />Leg: The leg is tight on my thighs, but like I said earlier, due to the fact that I have larger muscular thighs. I am hoping (based on other reviews) that this will sort itself out in the future as I wear them in and they stretch out a little. I don't want to go up to a 34&#34; waist to try and give more thigh room because like I said above, the 33&#34; is perfect. Anything larger would be rather loose around the waist.<br /><br />Length: The length is exact as well. Measured about 32&#34;-33&#34; in my leg, purchased 32&#34; because 33x33 doesn't exist, and it was the exact length. Sitting down the cuff will rise on my ankle, but that's expected to happen when you buy to fit. If there was a 33x33 or even a 33x34, I probably would have went with the longer leg.<br /><br />Value: I've been seeing reviews on Dappered and EffortlessGent to start purchasing chinos, but never was able to find a decent pair and a decent price. Everything I found were in the $70+ range. Being able to pick these up for $40-45 were quite the bargain (for what I was comparing them to).<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The only thing that would deter me is if the thigh doesn't stretch out a little bit over the next few weeks.
B00PGSW6KI|2|Great fit, very poor quality fabric
B00KKFC4V8|5|Love these jeans.  Great looking.  Very soft and comfortable.  A little bit loose,  so I am going to order an extra pair in a size smaller,  as my weight fluctuates.
B004353ANM|5|The precious little girl I bought these for just loved them which makes me a happy camper too.  Thank you.
B00EIHKG0U|3|It's very tight but it looks nice. It came early as well. The only thing I'm really disappointed about is the fit. I'm sure after I wear it more it'll stretch.
B00HN2BNBS|5|I purchased this item from my granddaughter. The pants fit well because she is long the shirt was a little big but I expected the fit.
B005QR8PAE|5|Great shirt.  Sizing accurate.  Love this style of shirt.  The gold really stands out and very soft material.  Love it
B003D7KZ7A|5|I purchased these for my potty training 3 year old.  They do not hold a ton of urine, but will catch one accident, which is what I wanted them for.  They are not diapers and are not as absorbant as diapers, but they will prevent a huge puddle of pee on the floor of a restaurant when you are out!!  :)  my daughter loves them and is full potty trained now, but we still use them on long car rides just in case.    I read some complaints that the elastic is too tight.  I usually just stretch out the leg holes a bit before she puts them on.  This seems to do the trick.
B0081K93FY|4|Nice sized bandana 27x27. I bought the drab green one and love the color. I would buy more but $5.13, is too pricey for a bandana.
B00MHVHAX0|5|This is the cap you really want. First class. Top shelve. John Hanly & Company now have a customer for life. When I endeavor to purchase more caps in the future, this is the manufacture I will be going to.
B00MEA0FWW|1|This dress was horrible. It was huge and very tacky. The different pieces of the dress were totally clashing shades of yellow, and the whole dress looked like it was about to fall apart when i took it out of the package. I tried to get it returned, but the company would not pay shipping back to them, so it wasn't worth it for me to ship it back to them in China. Please do not buy!
B00E1JO9VC|5|This is a GREAT shirt. I would say because it is all loose and flowy that you would want to order a size smaller then you normally would unless you want it really loose.. either way it looks nice... The front is shorter (hip length) & the back covers your booty... love the colors and it is a versital shirt as it will be perfect in the summer or in the winter with a cute jacket over it...
B00DNIDN82|3|This shirt is beautiful, but it fits like a too-small Speedo. I wear a size 2XL but ordered a 3XL because I like my clothes to be loose. It fits like an XL, and is not tee-shirt material. It's more like Underarmor material.
B009KJEZ6M|5|I didn't really expect this, but... these are actually my favorite underwear now. I dropped off the rest of everything at goodwill.<br /><br />the lack of fly takes a bit of getting used to, but you know what I never have problems with anymore? jibbly bits sneaking out of my fly. one of those things that doesn't seem like a problem, until all of a sudden it's happening to you and you're super annoyed about it. they're kind of tight too - they're not see-through or anything, but you don't need much imagination to figure out what's underneath, you know?<br /><br />nevertheless they're really comfortable, which is exactly what I was looking for. they're super cheap. just try a pair.
B00MZ594X2|2|Usually, I love Cuddl Duds, but I don't love this top. It is super light weight, as if made for summer time. It is VERY BIG. I'd say the size Large is at least a size 18. And there is something wrong with the collar. It doesn't lay flat, like the photo. It sort'f stands up all the way around, lending to it's, already too frumpy, frumpiness.<br /><br />I gave this to my husband to sleep in, as it was a gift and I won't wear it.
B00485DC5I|5|I wore this to my interview - and needless to say - got the job!  I would definitely buy again, and again.
B00MH215F8|5|Great and quick service.  Thanks!
B00G4TWXWY|5|As advertised, even came with free goggles :o) My granddaughter wore it all summer.
B007ILRU16|2|Bought these for my 8 year old autisic son as he need jammies that don't have a waistband.  The zipper stiching has let go on every set of the jammies, I bought 3.  Don't waist your money on these ones
B008HASBKQ|3|way to short
B003XKNTLQ|4|Just be aware that the standard sizes seem to be on the small side. I ordered a Large and although I fit the guidelines based on the size charts, the jacket is a little snug. I do beleive that it is tight fitting by design so that the thermal lining is more effective.<br /><br />Looks like it would make a good ski jacket. However for casual wear, I would have preferred a looser fit...<br /><br />If you like lots of room, order one size larger.
B002CM0Q4Y|5|Comfortable and non-slip.
B00L8SV7GE|4|A little more matronly than I expected but it's very nice. Very well made and substantial. Fit true to size.
B009PMILQE|4|I got medium. Nice warm wearable to wear in winter. I wear it with leggings and my boots . It's thick easy nice color perfect winter fall clothing. Came early. I recommend this company
B00KZZ86BK|5|Good fit. Loved it.
B00IEHD2K6|5|I purchased these thinking that for the price, what did I have to lose.  These shorts are great quality and wash very well.
B00KFVGM9C|4|I should have gotten a large - never really know the correct size when cycling stuff comes from China. Quality seem fine.  I generally wear a medium in everyday clothes. I plan to keep,price is right. it. I am  5'9&#34;, 155lb, 33w
B002ZP1ABG|3|I purchased a size small of this tee for a young friend. It was definitely smaller than the merchant size guide led me to believe. If you don't want an uber clingy tee (we're talking saran wrap), I suggest ordering a size up.  This is a thin material tee but of similar fabric quality to most trendy teen tees.
B007W8A8SW|2|Marked out large and put small on the tag and gave to Goodwill!  Disappointed that she could not wear them!!!
B004A7XY84|3|need to order more
B00R3J6I5M|2|The colors are awful!
B0085OZA08|4|Fits great if I don't wear anything with any thickness under it.  The color is lovely and looks good when I wear it with my tanks.
B0028NU8EU|5|This piece of jewelry has a very strong magnet. Product is bigger than I thought it would be, but it does the trick.
B00JMAG67K|5|Awesome skirt, paired with knee hi boots a i catching look.
B013MK0GTY|5|I see people wear these all the time and I just knew this would be perfect for my boyfriend.  He is definitely not a dress up guy!  He prefers t-shirts and jeans and would wear them everyday if he could.  However, there are some instances where dressing up is a necessity.....and there are some instances where this shirt would be PERFECT!  I can see him wearing this to a bachelor party or to a backyard barbecue or some outdoor picnic just to be funny.  This is definitely for a wise guy and that he is!  It is not a cheaply made shirt.  You can see from my pic that is is made from heavy cotton yet it is still quite soft and comfy.  It is true to size as he normally wears an XL and this fits like all his others.  He will surely get more laughs the next time he wears it.  I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.
B00EK5NFSA|4|My three year old Grandson loved costume it fit perfect over jacket. The only problem was the elastic on the hat  that goes under chin  broke as soon as I stretched to do so.
B00I7EN35A|5|This shirt is worth the money. The fabric is cotton, the buttons are of coconut shells and it is made in Hawatt. Best Hawaiian shirt buy on Amazon.  If you are going to buy a Hawaiian shirt (flowered shirt) buy cotton with coconut shells.<br /><br />Why spend your money on the oil based fibers?  Cotton is good and lasting. Oil based fiber have a limited useful life regardless of what the experts say. I have been sewing for forty-years and know fabric. I know how different fabrics wear over time and can contrast it to other fibers made in the same time period.<br /><br />Please do not misunderstand, having a few synthetics is not bad. It is important to know the source of the fiber so you may balance your wardrobe and only use synthetics when absolutely necessary.<br /><br />Petroleum is used to make rayon, nylon, lycra, spandex, acrylic, and polyester. Something to consider when assessing your carbon footprint.
B0051U18KA|5|Ok, they are socks and they fit as expected
B007HJFD9U|5|This bra looks and fits so great.  It is more comfortable then any<br />other types that I have and I am going to order another.
B001GZUQ9S|5|Great quality and durable, especially for little kids!
B00ED48X3A|5|I have never used this type of product before. I was seeking something for  compression and decided to give Slim Hot a try.<br />I go walking 2 to 3 miles twice a week. I have back and knee problems which can make comfort a challenge. The Slim Hot pant are constructed in a material similar to a wet suit. It's sturdy construction helps support my back on legs which helps me achieve my activity goal. These pants WILL MAKE YOU SWEAT! I notice the sweat within 10 minutes. They are a big improvement over those vinyl sauna suits popular in the 70's.<br />Some people might be put off by the thick material but I think the pants are worth a try.
B000ICGAIG|5|love it
B00N733FYA|2|Very thin fabric and runs small and shorter than expected.  Will be returning this
B00E18BUY2|5|This is going to be used for my daughter's Christmas dress.  it is so beautiful. Not childish or goofy, but still girly, youthful, and elegant. i love it, and so does she. It will snag easy because of the metallic threading, so be careful.  It is layered and the material is thick and cut with precision. It is a well made dress and I love it.
B00535QBIC|5|I like it
B009ZXBT8K|3|Not real high quality, but as a costume accessory, it kinda works.
B00769I438|5|Very pleased with item.
B00BXNP1ZC|5|loved it! had a much more incredible front print then i thought it was going to have. really loved it
B00DW085WA|5|Love these! So comfortable and fit my curvy body just right! I feel comfortable wearing out to do errands or just lounging at home! Plan to order more!!
B0000ANDE0|5|Carhartt  coats are great. I tried them on at the store to see what size fit me best then I found my best deal here. I am very happy with my purchase coat arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect new condition.
B00KOKA7PY|2|I'm a 2x in Nike and under armor pants and I could not get these past my knees. If your looking for a bigger sizes try these. I ordered a 3x and they fit perfectly. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LGRY8VI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
B004OG7BTE|4|Very beautiful and vibrant color combination
B000V9JR7W|5|Suspenders used to be thought of as an undergarment and so they were covered with vest.  However, as vest went away then so did suspenders.  However, now they are not undergarments and in many cases are the proper way to finish certain pants.  If your pants have the little flap with a button hole that you button across the centerline then suspenders are the proper way to finish those pants.  Also, for those of us carrying around more weight then we need, suspenders are far more comfortable than belts.<br /><br />These CTM suspenders are very well constructed and look very nice.  They also have a great feel to them.  I've got some expensive suits and some cheap suits.  These suspenders go with all of them and make them look nice.  I also use suspenders with sports coats and slacks.<br /><br />Some people may comment on your \\"grandpa\\" look.  However, if you are a sharp dresser then suspenders are another accessory in addition to the tie to make you look good.  I will admit I get a lot of comments about stock broker, or questions about why I wear suspenders but people also often compliment me and label me a sharp dresser.  It's a great opportunity to strike up a conversation and get to know someone also.<br /><br />I got the khaki and navy version of this. These suspenders do not come with either buttons or metal clasps.  Very very nice.  However, the khaki is more yellow then neutral.  That makes them an advanced pair of suspenders and limits their utility somewhat.  Yellow is usually used on a brown pallet not black.  I would recommend the black with grey as they would be more versatile.<br /><br />First thing to do on these suspenders is get rid of the metal clips.  If you use metal clips, a clip on tie, and a short sleeve shirt than this is not the set of suspenders for you.  Dickie suspenders are cheaper and much more up your ally.  If you want to learn to dress better, then these will be a good start.  Get a pair with black ends and a pair with brown ends.  Get some solid long sleeve shirts, grey, white, egg shell, black, blue etc.  Use your black end suspenders with black shoes, black, grey, or blue suit and a tie in the red, black, grey, blue realm.  Use your brown end suspenders with brown shoes, brown suit, brown pants, and a tie in the green, brown, peach, yellow family.  This is very basic list and there are all sorts of exceptions but it is a great place to start.  With solid shirts it is very hard to go wrong.<br /><br />Second thing is to have the buttons sewn into your pants.  The difference between metal clips and button suspenders is like the difference between a clip on tie and a real tie.  It's not that expensive either.  If you have several sets of suspenders then you can just leave them on your pants.<br /><br />Pros<br />More comfortable than a belt.  Especially for those of us carrying around more weight than we need.<br />Fashion statement<br />You will get comments about the way you dress.<br /><br />Cons<br />Did not come with buttons<br />Takes more time to put on than a belt.<br />If you only have one set you will have to get more buttons to have them sewn in.<br />One or two belts does it all.  You will probably want multiple sets of suspenders which can get rather expensive.rey, white, egg shell, black, blue etc.  Use your black end suspenders with black shoes, black, grey, or blue suit and a tie in the red, black, grey, blue realm.

B00PJ6HM7E|5|This is a very small sized skirt. I'm 5'11 220lbs so I'm not a small person. I got the largest size and it was a little small. I actually make the skirt shorter and it look a lot more flattering. I like the material and the zipper is good material. It def fits, it's just not very flattering as a long skirt.
B00NGWQ14S|3|the fabric quality is not good quality
B00OURQFXA|1|Very low quality
B004CRU08Y|5|I love the brand NYDJ.  They fit great, they wear great and they are sooo comfortable.  Easily my favorite pair of jeans.
B00C7W8HBS|4|Comfortable and stayed put; these did not show along the lowcut sides of my flats, and did not slip or fall down at the heel, despite running/walking fast through two airports, and two brief tours once landed.<br /><br />A bit larger than expected, the area just behind the silicone gripper pattern on the ball of the foot had a slight wrinkle, which would ease and stretch while wearing but was not uncomfortable, just noticeable.<br /><br />The silicone gripper heel pads worked great, to keep these from falling and slipping down at the back.<br /><br />Will wash and dry these in a lingerie bag, to see if heat drying them resolves the sizing issue.<br /><br />Good price, good cut, good fit, and fast delivery; would definitely buy these again.
B004XW8VFW|2|The quality is nice but the holes don't rest over my knuckles so they appear to not fit properly. I suppose one has to try on various brands/sizes to find the best fit per individual.
B000X3ON2K|3|I bought three of these in different colors.  I like the quality; exactly what I wanted for lounging around the house, BUT, they are *extremely* small!  All of my bras have the label &#34;38 DD&#34;. I bought size 38 C/DD and I couldn't hasten them around my body!  Exchanged them for size 42C/DD but *still* too tight - too tight for just lounging around.  I would really like to exchange them again; I guess I would need a 46 C/DD in this product.  YIKES!  But if it fells less restraining I guess that's the size I'll have to get ... now that I've said all this I've convinced myself - think I will exchange them again.  If it didn't run so small I would give this product a &#34;5&#34;.
B00C57A8DK|4|bought these for my husband- he says that they are very very comfy, no ride up like with others and says that he does notice a difference in the temp
B007F55ALW|5|i bought this for new years and this shirt was sexy and i love it cant believe how sexyyy it looks
B004E06HRC|2|Runs small
B000NKNOKA|5|it's often difficult to order a product over the internet without  seeing it first.  these t-shirts are excellent.
B005LK8J6Q|5|Arrived quickly.  The shirt is made of great quality soft material, same as Mac's beer shirt (the brand is called suburban riot).  Not sure why others may have issues with how it fits but I always wear a size xl, ordered a size xl and it's a nice comfortable fit for me.  I'm glad I spent a little extra money on the authentic.
B00C2G81G0|5|Well packaged. Fits as expected. Adorable
B00IJOQULW|5|Great product that my wife loves! Very confy and great design. You might go up a size or two in the shirt just to be safe.
B00A8I93SO|3|I had this shirt already so I returned this one to buy something else. I didn't need two of the same shirt.
B009Z2MQ9W|5|The print is beautiful and unusual. The length, fit was perfect and very easy to care for. Fabric is very nice too.
B001PQSH8U|5|I ordered these after I read an article by Dr. Oz saying that they help with cellulite.  I love wearing them!  After I wore these for a while and liked them, I also ordered two pairs of the shorts so I could wear them with shorter clothes.
B00J0QDRKA|5|Nice T-shirt.Looks and feel great.
B00A0N8WRK|5|I love animal hats and have a huge collection. This is a really cute hat and fit my 7 1/4&#34; head
B004CFDBRS|5|THIS SLIP PROVIDE SUPPORT AND SLEEK LOOK ACCENTUATING  THE GARMENT ON TOP FOR A PERFECT FIT. I PERSONALLY LOVE THE BLACK BECAUSE IT GIVES COVERAGE AND PRIVACY AS AN UNDERGARMENT SHOULD. FOR THE WOMAN WHO DOES NOT WISH TO EXHIBIT THE DETAILS OF HER BODY BUT SHOW OF HER FIGURE TO ITS FULL ADVANTAGE , THE BASIC CONTROL FULL SLIP IS FOR YOU.
B00IMB289A|3|Another misleading photo and description by Rubies Costume. I honestly really liked the sweater. I got compliments on it, and it fit well and looked great. HOWEVER there were no burns. Not even one. I didn't particularly care, the costume still looked fine, but the fact this is the second item I received from Rubies that was different then the photo is highly disappointing. Beware of ordering any costumes from them with the hopes it will be the same as the photo.
B0067UH3OI|5|Great fit, color fast, looks great over dresses, shirts, tanks, etc.  washed and dried well, keeping shape and color intact.
B00062NNN8|4|The product was made well. It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago. I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside.
B00DDNPPMY|5|This is the most comfortable hiking sock I've bought in a while. They have the cushion of a wool sock without the weight and the heat.<br />They grip your feet and don't move about.
B00MY2DG80|3|Did 'not know it could take 2 month for delivery before  perches wont do it  again
B004FWZUAO|5|I bought this for my husband to wear to a masquerade ball. It was a perfect fit and he loved it. Looks very masculine.
B0020ML3F2|1|Big and bulky
B00BPXITTA|4|These are your standard long-sleeved bodysuits (I call them undershirts).  I use these as an undershirt as well as a pajama top (paired with cotton pants) when the LO doesn't need something warmer.  They didn't shrink in the wash/dryer which is good.  There is room to grow which is also nice.
B008YWF8MQ|4|I think this one I bought is a little large. But I was to buy it for sleep, so it doesnot matter too much.<br />I used to buy XL in China, but did not think here the size is a little larger. However, the quality is OK.
B004OYT3TM|2|It was too small
B0055M2Q9Q|3|I read the other reviews about how these run small so I bought 1 size up, but these run extremely small. The tag for the XXL list waist size of 41-46, this isn't even close! The waist of the XXL measured 38\\". The quality seems pretty good so instead of returning these I'm going to hold on to them until I lose enough weight to fit in them.
B001J6OMLC|5|Love this bra! This is my second one, that's how much I love it. So very comfortable. Straps stay up on my shoulders all day long.  I wash in the washer and hang it to dry and it has not lost its shape at all. There is padding - and my size-a girls need the boost. The padding is comfortable and has maintained its shape and you cannot tell there is the boost!<br /><br />Overall, fantastic bra.
B00N5E0N8C|5|Great jacket ...fits perfectly !
B009Y9QBYW|5|I spend many hours outdoors working in the NE and this winter has been especially cold and snowy.<br />I got tired of spending so much $ on Smartwool (though I like their socks) and Wigwams quality has gone down.<br />The quality and value of these People Socks is hard to beat.  They are a little thicker and more cushiony than Smartwool but not enough to make my boots or sneakers feel too tight.<br />They are great for hiking.  And at my job I often have to stand out in the cold for a few hours at a time and these socks really keep my feet warm.<br />I highly recommend!
B00246IBZE|3|I'm going to give three stars because they seem like really nice scrubs, but they don't fit. I usually wear a small-medium in shirts and I bought an XS and it swallowed me!!! Going to try and sell them to someone because I fear sending them back may cost way too much money--and considering I got free shipping on them, I don't want to have to pay to send them back. Good quality. Don't fit.
B00CGUROQ0|4|Well made. no complaints.
B00NS01HRE|5|These scarfs are yummy.  I ordered three different colors and was hoping for the best because of the price.  They are truly beautiful and make perfect gifts that look like you spent 4 times the money.  Some of the girls in the office liked them so much they are placing an order too.  I'm going to tag on and get a couple more  Jan 2016 - Ordered two more!  The price went up slightly but still a bargain.
B009S3HYV8|5|the dress was just perfect
B000CENYNE|5|Purchased for husband for Christmas. He really likes it, very comfortable and warm.
B00A1ABXDM|5|Warm
B00ICGICWC|5|Fits my macbook perfectly, no complaints here
B00EYZJW1K|5|This is a very good bra. The fit is nice and the look is great. Unfortunately, I will not be able to wear it for a while since I am expecting and I am no longer a 34. But when I return to my normal size, I am planning on buying more of this brand.
B00C166U5A|4|Very good product!!
B00WZE85LA|5|I like the quality of the material very much!!! Shirt is really soft.  I've bought a few shirts online from other vendors but these shirts have a much better quality feel to them.  My only complaint is the size I'm 6 ft 210 and the XL still feels more like a slim fit shirt.  Maybe get a size or two larger then what you normally wear.
B00A9RVD5K|3|Comfy, but wish it had pockets and was a little shorter.
B007IGJCLC|5|I love this dress! Fits true to size. Looks better than picture. The length is perfect for petite women (I'm 5'-4\\").  It's very firm fitting and sexy.
B001WPPO6M|4|Just fit with chin guard underneath for my slim child so if fuller bodied and need to wear chin guard underneath order up or just wear as a fun theme sock.
B005GPHWC8|4|They are very nice and comfortable.  I have the blue jean leggings as well as brown leggings and won't wear any other without the stretch for comfort.
B00FJ5LI3O|4|Perfect for storing extra cards, gift cards, etc.  have had it for a week and it seems solid!  thanks for great product and easy transaction!
B00AWT8SFS|5|These are funky fun colorful and most importantly very warm. They don't bind or irritate and you can sleep in them comfortably. My house is very cold and these are great. Thank you :)
B0008EOGDK|5|VERY GOOD
B0091CVYIK|5|Product was as described. Quick service
B00KCMJVTW|4|This is is awesome, but does run a bit big!!
B009XUK0YY|1|The email I received from &#34;Anna&#34; and &#34;Kids Apparel and Beyond&#34;, was very condescending and rude.  I will not order anything else form them.  Not only was the dress to big it was very poorly made.  When I received the dress I noticed that the fabric was cheap and the construction was poor.  I was going to keep it and just chalk it up for experience.  Then it did not fit and I decided to return.  Lesson learned form this company I can tell you!!!!!
B003XU6S6Y|5|The leather is (from what I can tell) genuine and basically one single piece. The buckle is solid and the whole thing has a nice, rich leather feel to it. Only had it a few weeks, but no pulled holes or any kind of initial damage you sometimes get with crappy belts. I got size 36 (I wear 34 waist) and it fits great.
B00WOKWBMO|2|It was ok... Not great... I am a medium/large so I bought a large... It was too small did not look like the picture!!!
B00GSD6R3M|5|I ordered this jacket for my daughter because I have the same style from Columbia and love it - I've had mine for probably 2 years.  These jackets are very light weight down, plenty warm enough for our winters and almost too warm sometimes if you layer too much under it (we live in the Ozarks and generally have winter temps between the occasional 18 below to low 40's or so during most days).  The jackets look nice and are well made.  They hold up very well.  BTW, my daughter wears a size 16 girls, but we got her the small in this one as it only looks slightly big now and she will grow into it quickly - so hopefully it will last a while!  I wear a medium and at 5'6&#34; and weight 136 lbs - if that helps anyone.
B000TA1SIY|5|very well made and very durable but also very comfortable, if your on your feet all day you don't even you have them on, they stay pulled up and never slip down which is a nice feature in any sock.
B00CEPXGLY|5|liked the door and the brand is a solid brand happy with purchase and also no apperciable fade noticed did  cold water first as I usually won't wear anything until at least 1 wash, subsequent washes were with warm water
B00A8VHQMG|5|Inexpensive and cute, I would recommend this seller to anyone.  It isnt expensive looking but why would it be for the price?  It's also not cheap looking.  Everything is trendy and affordable and adds a lot of variety to my closet.
B00K5IADB8|5|I have worn them several times.  They are not too thick but keep my legs warm.  I have watched them 4 or 5 times and they hold their shape.  I do not put them in the dryer.
B00LOC1J26|3|Cute concept but the pouch itself is too small.  I am regular size and ordered XL to compensate for the Chinese differences in sizes but still the briefs were a tight fit and the pouch definitely not large enough.
B00LK08LR8|4|Ok
B00412M2MC|2|Like my title says, the horns in this package are not a headband as the description says. They are actually two separate horns with little clip barrettes. Also they way the horns and tail are held in the package caused them to get scrunched and wrinkled. In the end, I am going to head out and see if I can find an alternate set of horns- on a headband- before my party tomorrow night.  Disappointing.
B00D5OW7QI|5|Love the way they feel.  I'm 5'4&#34; about 125 and the small is plenty roomy but the right length.  I wish they offered a XS.
B00LUUN8GM|1|These were really unattractive. I threw them away
B0057PS62M|5|I purchased this for my grandson to use after swimming lessons.  It works great and I can wrap him up and take him home to change and thereby not have to wait while he fools around in the boys locker room.  It needs several wash and dries before use so you get rid of all the lint.
B002K6F7BE|4|Very soft and comfy.  Feels a bit tight though.  I am normally 34b/c, and ordered an M. Maybe it will become looser.
B001FOR1PM|4|Nice sturdy and attractive belt.  Quite stiff when it's new but I have been wearing it for several weeks and it's holding up beautifully.
B004757ZTI|4|This shoe is very strong, and comes with a fabric, comfortable bottom for your feet. I use them my for pole fitness and instructors say its good to actually get the size of your feet and let the shoe contour to you (though it might be uncomfortable at first) because a bigger size can cause your ankle to roll over. I also heard that taking a hair dryer to it, then putting it on immediately after with a thick sock on will help it adjust quicker. Otherwise if your worried, go a size up!
B000HJLWX8|5|This is a really cute dress.  The price is great and the shipping was wonderful.  I received it about 2 days after I ordered it (that was regular shipping).  My (somewhat) compliant is that the dress looks like a lighter, softer blue on the picture.  It is still a cute dress and I think it will look nice for my little girl's pictures.  It looks relatively well-made, especially for the price and the materials used.  I think that my baby will be adorable in this dress.
B002TLUFDA|5|Great product
B0089SX74G|1|Way too small not what it looks like
B002XULNJ2|4|Size and quality are expected
B00AENBXWM|5|These socks were a great deal!  They came quickly and were reasonably priced!  The sizing was accurate!  I plan to buy more!
B00CE32AP4|4|THE SHELF KEEPS THE CAMI DOWN IN PLACE.WHEN WEARING A BRA.iT FITS THE PROPER SIZING IS DOCUMENTED IN THE ADD.
B00D2Q1F6W|2|This is a very small scarf. It's also very silky, which I'm not a big fan of. I thought it'd be better. Shipping took forever too.
B00A6JFHTO|2|cheap quality
B004TERJY8|5|I purchased this robe for my 97-year-old mother for a Christmas gift.  Because she is elderly, I was concerned that her lack of height would make the robe too long, which has been a major problem with other robes that she has.  To my delighted surprise, it was exactly the right length.  It is also very warm and cuddly, exactly right for my mother.  The delivery was actually earlier than I had expected (unusual for an order so close to Christmas).  The price was very reasonable for the quality of the product and I would order from this vendor again.
B003TF6LLU|4|Although the breast plate is what we were looking for, as part of a costume, the colors were not a match .
B0089ND408|5|The batman cape socks were really comfortable, fit perfect, and look....well AWSOME! In short. I really like them allot. And I will be buying more different style cape socks not just the batman ones, if I can find more that is.
B007DIRY56|5|Great story
B00H3EF0KQ|2|Broad shoulders...don't do it.
B00JJ8PI9W|3|Feathers all over the place.  Not only on my clothes but also on who may be sitting next to me.  This should not happen
B0055KYM04|1|Hey Old Glory where the heck is the large shirts I only see a small size able to be ordered headn to Chicago in july would luv to wear one but alas what the heck is the deal (the pun)
B002UKQ1E2|3|Its not a heavy duty wool but good enough for trudging to the store and around cool weather. Not meant for chilly type environments. Its very cute and it fits perfectly on me - im 5'1\\", 90lbs.
B000OWDON4|3|The bra isn't too hard to get on, but you do have to pull it over your head.<br />I like to have some &#34;compression&#34; to hold the breasts in place when working out.  There is none.  IF they had put a thicker fabric on the cups it would be much better to cover nipples.<br />I do like the criss cross in the back.
B0073ODTRM|1|I have purchase many CJ jeans in the past, these are not what I expected.  They were 6 inches too long, did not fit well and certainly not the \\"Faith Straight Legged\\" style I have ordered in the past from her line.
B00QFMZFNE|3|Very soft b ut you better have short arms to put both hands in the glove sections.
B00B5TTMQS|5|This skirt was great quality and inexpensive. It fits flatteringly and is perfect for work or a casual outing. Exactly what I wanted!
B00E9TN9TC|5|My toddler loves it, nice fabric, has been using it for about 3 months, has been washed and ironed many times, no fading whatsoever, very nice quality compared to other T-shirts out there that fade and look old within the first wash
B003QOTO3G|4|These are great shirts and super easy to take care of...no ironing necessary...I just bought more of these in white and one size smaller...must have these as a staple in your closet.
B00B89OXH8|4|fit's a little high in the waist (it's really right under your boobs - unlike on the model) but its cute.
B004WY89Z8|4|it was a great short in this 2012 summer.Get one then to have a beach time,in CA.Diamond Print shows a real style to wear.love it.
B00P545J3E|5|Everything went perfect
B006AA5ERI|5|I bought this set for a gift, and the person I gave it to absolutely loves it. It arrived very quickly, and it is beautiful. I would highly recommend it to anyone!
B00JPHHQ92|4|Beautiful dress. Nice fabric.  But...a little annoying that it is not &#34;Black and White&#34; like the title states.  It is very definitely Black and Cream/Lt Tan. I bought it for a black and white photo session ... but will still keep it to wear this summer.
B00L1GJ0G2|5|I love the soft material and the sweet colors & prints.
B00PJXRV00|4|Love my dress. It fits perfectly. Definitely might buy the black one. And it was on time. Thanks
B00I9RX7BK|5|I love this maxi dress - it fits perfectly on me. I just ordered one more.
B007ZCLU2I|3|Good quality, but WAY too small
B002AQRTCE|1|I bought these pants to wear at the office, and the toughest physical work I did wearing them was sitting in a chair.  Despite that, they've become worn through in two different spots in the back.  I've never had pants get worn so quickly, after just a few months use.    I wish I could get my money back, but unfortunately their warranty doesn't cover holes.
B00JHH2YVA|4|Very cute
B000F0JMKE|5|THIS ITEM WAS CLOSE TO MY OLD ONE I GAVE TO MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IN BRASIL, I WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SAME ONE, BUT THIS ONE WAS CLOSE ENOUGH. THE PRICE WAS ALITTLE MORE THEN MOST TIES, BUT  YOU PAY FOR THE NAME, ITEM IS GOOD.
B006VOV38C|3|Ended up being too large in the waist, even for a size 16, which I just got down to. Returned them
B0009GA77Q|4|They are made of a little lighter weight fabric then what you but in the stores but they fit good and with the lighter weight it makes working out and running a lot easier. It would be nice if they had pockets but that's the only draw back I find.
B00J9EPZDK|5|These socks fit perfectly, feel great, look great.
B0077IK102|4|Nice belt but not the best quality leather.
B008JUTBPI|5|Love the gloves, good fit, good leather
B00BEM26U0|1|This was not worth to buy! after a few months it starting to be defective!<br />DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP PRODUCT!
B008XFATP0|4|Since this was &#34;girls&#34; I had expected it to fit like a girls size 10/12.  It was more like a 14/16<br />I would suggest to order down a size if you are buying it for a girl instead of a tween!
B0058LTVEC|4|Love the corset, cute cut and fit. Isn't the nicest ever, but great for the price, and worked well for a catwoman costume. Has a slight smell to the faux leather.
B0010X4F02|1|Bought specifically for my work pants - did not fit.  (My dress pants are from Kohls mostly - 2 small metal clasps). The one metal clasp on the belly band is too big - it does not fit through the metal brackets (or clasp holders?) on my pants.<br /><br />Tried the jean band - the button was too small, so it popped right out of the button hole.<br /><br />Product is a great idea, but did not work for me. Will return.
B004Q9T8X6|4|nice looking swim shorts.  Quality seems fine.
