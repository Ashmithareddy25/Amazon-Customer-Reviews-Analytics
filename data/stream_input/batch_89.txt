B002UJVNFA|5|Excelente producto
B00CPGQ1GO|5|This thing works great… as long as you don't forget it before you ride off.
B00BD4PVPG|5|Great fit good looks
B001FAGLAM|5|Bought these for a customer's Ranger to replace the automatic ones that were defective. He's happy, I'm happy.
B00FRJGVGG|5|Easy to install on my 2014 Scion TC. Remove the tow hook that is on the opposite side of the muffler and only four bolts are needed to bolt it to the frame. It's right below the bumper and is almost hidden which is great. Packaging could be better as there was a gash on the paint but some touch up was used to prevent rust on the exposed area.
B00UIW6W0C|5|I really like the look of these mirrors.  They unfortunately did non fit my scooter as the threads needed to be longer for my 2004 Aprilia Rally 50.  However that was quickly remedied by going to the hardware store and buying a couple bolts.  They look sharp, and I can now see what's going on behind me without looking back.
B0087NB088|4|Pros: sound quality is great and my husband says he has no problems hearing me speak even when I'm at 65 mph. Cons: I don't know if it is my helmet or the ear pieces or a combination of the 2; but after about an hour and a half of riding with these the Cartilage on the top of my ears  starts to hurt and by 2 hours I can hardly stand them.
B0012P1QN2|5|It fit my Saab and my a/c leak is gone due to a old valve.
B00T6DUL2Y|2|I am  disappointed  with the performance. I haven't seen  much of a difference after having it in my car for the last few weeks.
B000ARPVNO|5|GOOD
B002Q3DGUA|5|Works as stated
B000EQ1W52|5|GOOD SO FAR
B00OKJXS10|5|Fit is true to size and very comfortable. Highly recommended!
B002ML8D7C|5|The decal surpassed any idea we had of what it would look like. The directions to apply it to the car window were easy and we had no problems.<br />The company does an amazing job and we were very pleased with the results.
B0049W4VVE|5|Fast shipping of a great product.  Just what I needed for my new XP 850.
B002UC4WZU|4|replaced the old one that was sun damaged and cracking. I am happy.
B001AIZ5HY|5|This stuff worked great. It took a little longer to polish my OEM headlights than it did my friend's aftermarket lenses, which is due to varying plastic hardness, but both looked great after. I also bought the refill that goes with this kit, and I still have some unused discs after doing two medium sets of headlights and working on a pair of aftermarket taillights. Would highly recommend; 3M doesn't disappoint.
B007KSZQU4|5|Perfect fit. Exactly as advertised.
B009GIUB2Y|5|great fit and easy install.
B00JIAB836|4|Headlights are nice but You'll need to harvest a lot off of your original headlights. I had to take the bracket, rubber gaskets, Bulbs (daytime and high beam) and sockets off of my OEM headlights.  The blinkers are not as powerful as the stock ones so your car is going to think the bulbs are out (turn signals will blink very fast).  They look a lot better than what I had so I can't complain.  The turn signal thing I could see being extremely annoying to some people.
B00E0SSZ8C|1|On the picture it shows red with black reason I bought it. Instead it was solid red color not what I expected.
B003SS62PS|3|Pros: Puts out a good amount of air and it oscillates.  It also has a nice long chord.<br /><br />Cons:  The switch is garbage.  If the switch is your selling point, don't buy it.  We used the fan twice before the switch failed.  Easy enough fix to just yank the switch and solder the wires together.
B005TOLSBC|5|Works better than the original. Had no problems at all putting the board from my old remote inside of this one.
B00267APNM|5|works good
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Very effective
B000X9XTJ2|5|Perfect fit. Built solid. Received in a timely manner. This company will be on my short list.
B005HFYE1O|5|perfect!!!!!!!
B00BD4SM9S|5|Great price great product
B001CQWM8E|1|Sorry, had to return this item as it does not fit a Polaris Ranger 900.
B004YEIV9U|5|GREAT QUALITY! THANKS
B00196SK60|5|Great product! Straight forward packaging. Easy install, can do in less than 30 minutes. Great seller! Will purchase again!
B00C9IWWLG|1|Returned it. Cost a fortune to send back too!
B0010GCVU0|5|worked great<br /><br />no more message now
B00393NDHW|3|Came in a little scratched up
B001BMVTEW|1|Looks good and easy to install
B00G8Z975A|5|Works perfectly, fits perfectly, no complaints, only good !
B002X54SBM|4|great
B009DK2M9K|4|Plate holder fit my 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 with no issues.
B001TXWNLQ|5|works great
B00BQYCKE8|1|Worst I have used.  Good size but bad material.  It's plush but leaves lint on one side and the other side has really small loops.  Not your standard microfiber.  Just not good material for automotive detailing.
B00CA5M9WA|4|Part was good..only was missing the sway arm from the whole assembly...i had to buy that separate...
B00MYA6AXA|5|Great fit.  Very satisfied.
B00IKSL04O|1|Horrible quality, item did not fit as advertised and broke in half before I was even able to install it. Toe piece is very loose and rattles like crazy.
B0041FXOFI|5|The Bedstep is easy to install and very handy for getting in and out of the bed.  I installed it on my 2011 Tundra.  As other reviewers have indicated, you will need a long ratchet/torque wrench or breaker bar to remove the bolts from the truck.  In addition, I needed a deep socket 19 mm socket to reinstall the bolts to attach the Bedstep to the truck.  Fortunately, I had one handy.  There are some good YouTube Bedstep installation videos available too.  Among other uses, we use our truck for traveling and carrying our bicycles.  Jumping in and out of the truck get's old fast.  My knees appreciate the step.  Our 4 year-old likes it too.  The Bedstep makes it easy to get in and out of the truck to load and unload the bed.
B007BGVDJI|5|It was a great fit
B00BLGKQEC|5|The assortment of ends would take weeks to track down and buy individually.  This is definately a must to have if you have any cable operated vehicles like motorcycles, atvs, or golf carts.  Those cables can cost you up to $20.00 bucks if an end fails and you can use whats in this kit.
B00UMQ5P8O|2|Does not fit my 2015 Jeep Sahara. Too loose of a fit. There were no instructions, which were guaranteed to be included so I had to google search for the instructions. Was very easy to install, just didn't fit tight. Arrived within days of order.
B00WMQ17TS|5|Good
B000CN9K0Q|4|These fit perfectly on my husbands truck.
B00G7KPPR0|5|What a difference......its night and day when you compare the sound of my bike after installing my Vance and Hines...I recommend everyone to also buy the fuelpak from Vance and Hines since you will be changing the air/fuel ..
B00D0ACCXK|4|product was just as described, easy to install and works great.  I would deal with this customer again.
B00T6JEC0K|5|This small thing saved my life. I was so tired of hitting the bottom of my machine every minute on Rocks I had to try something to open ut the Clearance. this was a great fix.
B000JZGN6G|5|Dorman saved the day as well as my wallet. These are the same item you'll receive from the big parts chains in different branded boxes. So why pay the outrageous prices for the same item. Quality is excellent and so is the fit. You will not get any mounting hardware, but you won't get robbed either. Oh you will get cotter pin and retaining nut. I was referring to mounting bolts when I said no hardware. Rubber seems excellent and so is part overall. Can't beat the quality of Dorman for the price. Ball joint and bushings are all correct fitting and installation was a breeze. Thanks Dorman for the excellent part with out the theft of my wallet. Thanks amazon for another quality part and service!
B001KS6FPA|5|Exactly the part I needed.  It had very clear installation instructions and easily snapped in place.
B000CIK8CA|5|It has a very high end look that stands out from most other brands.  The tone is mild (exactly what I was looking for), with hardly any cruising noise.  Installation was not difficult with air tools and ramps.
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Good to keep with you when on a trip and is good to see how the battery and charging system on the bike is doing.
B000QGGICC|5|Fits my 03 cbr600rr tank perfectly. This product is thick and the carbon look is beautiful. I also like that they throw in an extra tank fuel lid pad/sticker. Unlike the other tank pad I purchased from the same company this fortunately has no defects. Do I recommend? Yes indeed.
B000C9CC14|5|no regrets on ordering this for my truck, I have a 1997 CHEVY K1500 4x4, fit perfectly and works great.
B002RSIK4G|5|used this to seal roof seams on a box trailer. works great
B00062Z4B2|5|Great product fit my 1988 mustang great would buy another for a Manual transmission.
B0066T5RH0|5|Great Quality, perfect fit for my 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon
B000XEFKEE|5|Product is exactly as described.  I haven't had to test them yet, but they appear to be exactly what I was looking for.  I just wish they shipped to Hawaii.  I had to wait to order them until I visited my son in the Virginia, which they shipped for free.  Huge price difference.
B00OWK4E3I|5|My old one wore out and was not big enough for my new truck. This one is awesome. The quality is great you don't feel like you will ruin it by rubbing too rough or damage the vehicle.
B00SVE1R7W|5|Instauled and working well.
B000C2WF0E|2|Key works, but not easily. The key has real trouble getting in there. Usually takes a few tries, which is annoying. My bf hates it so much he won't unlock it so its always me unlocking it. Will try another brand next time.
B0002V4PRG|4|Good blow off tool for compressed air systems.
B007CLM2JM|4|Surprisingly as show thats how it comes nice box and all only reason for 4/5 is the bulb doesnt fit as well as it should as if the plastic was a tiny bit thinner would be perfect i installed these on 2014 yamaha r1 looks amazing
B00840I6F4|5|Remarkable,  you beat out all other local auto parts places like Auto Zone. This part completely eliminated the existing problem.<br />Great product#
B000BZ93HK|5|This is an exact replacement for 2004 Nissan Titan axle bearing (same brand as OEM)... at less than half the cost.<br /><br />Note that this bearing includes the press on spacer needed for Nitan Titan axle<br /><br />You will need to also get a GENUINE Nissan axle seal (found on Amazon for $25). Do not re-use your old one.... and usually the bearing is not the problem, a leaking seal is the issue but you just have to destroy the bearing and spacer during removal.
B0024ECCJW|5|Works good
B000J4GCV8|4|works fine..
B00DOZC4N4|5|These are great.  Good product, fits over my regular glasses easily but don't look I'm on the way to the nursing home.
B000F5LJ7S|5|excellent product for price
B001V8U12M|5|Works great
B004KJ6KFG|5|Fit great in my 2&#34; hitch.
B005O97Q9A|5|Pretty fast, good quality and easy to install!...thx
B007GRSJR6|5|Fits, and good to have a spare, even though shields hold up a lot longer than they used to.
B005AU59W4|4|Wrong picture but great product!!
B00BXM3M2W|5|The fit is Excellent.  At 70 mph the helmet stays in place.
B00NGIXKKK|5|perfect
B00GXXCP24|1|cheezy
B001DRJ3CA|5|fast shipment part fit perfectly
B00CW9JO4A|5|Great price, Great product
B001EOYIKE|5|Works perfectly and very little rust for the amount of water and salt exposure it gets!
B007WR25ES|4|We used this last weekend, and ended up going through very heavy wind leaving town and then heavy rain near our destination. We don't have a roof rack or rails, but the straps through the car did a great job holding it in place. We were pleasantly surprised to find everything dry inside when we opened it. The only problem is that one of the zippers broke the very first time we unzipped it :(
B000EOR1I6|5|Very well made product, and it looks great.  After a month I've noticed an increase of about one mile per gallon in gas mileage according to the truck's computer.  It's nice to be able to have the back window open without sucking in junk from the bed.  Above 65 miles an hour it does tend to make some noise, but nothing that's really annoying.  So far only one clamp has fallen off, but you couldn't tell until the cover opened.  Installation was very easy, no need to watch any videos, just follow the written instructions.  However, having never owned one before, I didn't know how tight the cover should be.  The instructions say to not adjust the tension before installing because it's preset at the factory.  Surprised I didn't break something when I first closed it, after decreasing the tension it closes much easier.
B000QC6H90|5|Used it on the rails of my SUP boards. I need more.
B0007Y5TB4|5|I shopped around for a long time looking for a good set of quality ramps. These seem to be the sturdiest well built ramps I could find without breaking the bank. The best feature is the full length top tabs that rest on the tailgate. Very sturdy and secure. Still light enough to move around without any problems.
B000RL7GJU|5|good fit and does the job ---thanks
B00RGRVE5U|2|No issues with the shipper, but manfacturing is sub-par - while the tail light is great looking, the LED lights are way too dim, no instructions and the assembly leaks terribly. Had to purchase other LED bulbs and re-seal to make this item functional
B002YFSD7Q|5|Great fit and product!
B001EQ7S2C|5|Great price on a great, quality product!
B004NCZNQW|5|Its great. But this helmet seems to run a little small. I got a 3X, I could've gotten a 4X.
B00ARYC5MK|5|Does what I need it to. Transport our bicycles and nothing too very heavy.
B00LH5YL9S|4|great item, a little tight running the air line to the gauge, kept getting a kink the tubing when installing the switch panel. other than that it is a great item.
B004XL0I18|5|good
B00IM9AQJG|3|not  bad
B000P0U04G|4|wish I had them when I started would have saved cleaning up a mess
B007Y5SP7E|5|Added security if you drop your Accu-gage.  Fits perfect.
B000UIQ4MK|5|Easy to install.  Perfect match.  Great part.
B008Y59BAS|1|Didn't fit!
B00VGL8VGM|5|Just what I wanted and came through the mail quickly
B00SBZRELY|4|I had to put an o-ring in one of the tank adaptors to prevent leaking. After that it worked well. Only used it twice so can't give info about longevity of the product.
B000W0KTMW|4|Heavy, but effective.
B005DTWUDI|5|This stuff works, got my first v8 (2004 gto) about 2 weeks a go and there was noise coming from the rear at low speeds/rpms, so i decided to change the diff fluid, so i ordered this stuff and torco type f additive as everyone says to on the forum and wow it stopped making noise completely i was surprised.
B006ZSUR5O|5|Works great and so far its perfect. Haven't felt and drop in pressure or performance
B00A89JM5M|5|very nice
B0002T5P2C|5|Perfect, they look great and a very good price. I like doing business with this vender.
B00N2DI3Q0|4|A little cheesy and boxy so I do not leave them on my vehicle because I can feel and hear how much they drag my vehicle down and my tachometer pushing more revs then usual on my daily commute...
B002GISKFQ|5|Super quick ship, fit perfect in 10 minutes!
B00VNQNQBK|3|no clue how well they work since they didnt actually fit in my 3157 socket
B00DD0ZGQM|5|Second set I've bought; great investment.
B000C55UT4|1|Not sure why but bushings dod not fit the king pin....no way would this have worked.
B00ATWLY0E|5|It is not really Grey but rather a blueish or purplish grey.  I actually like the color.  It doesn't leave lint on dark clothes.
B00C5D2H2O|1|it would have work if it was the right one but now I have a problem returning it nobody want too take it back
B003YKXTSI|5|Great little tool when you're in a pinch!  With the key ring attachment, it goes everywhere I go.
B000CD56J0|5|Good prices on original equipment parts
B00K8BLRLM|4|they work
B007AAUTG8|3|I own a 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan. For an aftermarket camera it serves it's purpose. It provides more security knowing what is in our major blind spot.
B00VFEDZYI|5|Works perfect!  We love it!  Easy to use.  Saves us money and more importantly time.
B00UE4DFTU|5|These small pawp
B00COYNZJ8|5|My hubby absolutely loved this. Great quality!!! Makes a perfect gift.
B001KQD7KS|1|Didn't fit 16v 1.6l. Suzuki sidekick
B010SPXDE6|1|Completly useless. Doesnt stick.
B009Y8AB7Q|2|Loses it shape on this giant window.
B000B68V6I|5|+++++  ARRIVED AS LISTED. THANK YOU.  I USE THIS IN ALL OUR &#34;TOYS&#34; , MOWER, WEED EATER & GAS BLOWER.  EXCELLENT PROTECTION FOR STORED AND MINOR USE GAS ENGINES.  +++++
B011W6FRQW|3|Not a very strong spring
B000W0RQ8C|5|Durable, solid steel, product seems like it will<br />last a lifetime.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Live in Arizona, this sun shade works better than any others I have used! I noticed a huge difference in the difference of the tempature in my truck. Very well made & easy to use... Highly recommend
B00RVEFL4S|5|looks awesome
B00BD4GRGI|5|Cool
B00AAZNTUS|5|Great item. Easy install but you do have to drill holes. a++++
B00LP44SO4|5|Perfect fit. Looks great
B0001L0DFA|5|Great product. Easy to hold. Durable as heck. Had one for 10 years and then it went missing. Now I have four of them.
B008MISDH4|4|Good oil. Great price.
B000QFVJTU|5|Does what it pose to
B00AR5UV5W|5|Perfect fit,and keeps my car cooler..in In the Houston heat
B00C1CEJNY|5|Worked great!  Got these as a backup in case I needed them when replacing the fuel pump.  Sure glad I did because the rusted pump made the old connections tough to remove.  The integrated clips in these connectors work better too.
B007V2CQQG|4|High quality materials but the fit is not as perfect as I had expected. However, this shield appears to do the job.
B00P2D41OQ|5|They look awesome, and they put out more light than the factory halogens.  High quality product!
B00T62RK1U|5|love the light's. the light's work great at night backing in the camp site at night
B000OO4Q16|5|ok
B002J8RTF0|5|Best light I've ever used for lighting up any work area on the car. Very bright. High quality.
B00BQA3VD6|5|2 thumbs up
B001OBECXU|5|Hard to believe these things are this cheep.
B00COYNZJ8|5|nice
B002SSKFGG|1|This was a good price but when arrived the entire frame was all bent up, the shipping box was not damaged so had to have come from the MFG like that.  Suburban was good to work with and did pick it up and refunded me the money.
B000N322K0|3|This device works well for removal of your transmission, but the biggest drawback is the height of the product.  Attaching this to a jack renders this product pretty much useless unless you can jack your car up 4 or 5 feet in the air.  I jacked my car up as high as my jack stands would go, put the transmission adapter on and successfully removed the transmission, but I could not get the jack out from under the car!<br /><br />I had to take the transmission off the adapter to get it out from under the car.  Upon reinstalling the transmission I totally abandoned the product.<br /><br />I would only buy this product if you can jack your car up to the moon.  Otherwise you are just wasting your time and money.
B007MUY5PM|5|Replacement was easy, perfect match.
B000C9EFFK|5|if you have GM buy GM .
B00EDFM83A|5|Replaced the regular auto bulbs in travel trailer. Plenty of light and much cooler.
B000C9DHE0|5|Now my A?C works again just like new should have done this two years ago
B007NLQO0O|3|I had one leak, don't know why
B000BQWHDQ|5|A must for cleaner dumping. Also, this adapter provides for different diameter connections for different campground dumping station drains, when connecting your adapter to dump station drain opening.<br />RP
B00QUYRQ66|5|The little things always are loved the most.  Just applied this to the propane line and it seems to fit lovely.  I hope this one won't have the same issue as the last one and just fall off somewhere.
B0001EW4FO|5|Looks good and was simple to install
B00HPBT1NY|1|For honda accord 2 doors?
B0015RMU78|3|Depending on your truck year, there may be a handful of extra parts in this kit, and it may be missing springs. In my case, 2005 Toyota Tundra, there were 4 extra posts, 2 extra springs, and missing 2 other springs. However it looks like this is a systemic problem that occurs in every drum brake kit specified and sold for my year Tundra.<br /><br />The other springs in this kit worked fine. All of them seemed to be as good as if not a slight bit tighter than the OEM ones they replaced. The posts are zinc coated, not yellow zinc like OEM, hopefully they hold up in the rust belt.
B000HHYADO|5|Theron trouble tamers are a good repair parts and tool company
B003XVCCW2|4|The bleeder screw is too small, in my opinion.  It makes removing a snug or seized screw difficult (reason why I had to buy new as I rounded the threads on one of mine.)
B000FW2MCM|1|Does not work.
B00VQR3JYU|4|nice light
B005NLQAHS|1|I bought this product due to it's good reviews, hoping it would be able to help me get to the bottom of the mysterious &#34;maintenance required&#34; light that just came on in my 1997 Acura CL. After plugging the device in and pairing it with my android device I opened up the torque app and gave it a few minutes to sync up. I selected &#34;Show Logged Faults&#34; and waited for the results... &#34;No fault codes stored in ECU&#34;. So after all this hassle, the device apparently doesn't think there are any fault codes even though my dashboard clearly shows that there are. I tried the &#34;Clear Logged Faults&#34; option as well which did absolutely nothing. What is the point of this device if it can't check and clear fault codes in the ECU?
B00FFTYUJI|5|Door handle is very well made and fit perfectly!  Highly recommend​!
B009XAQZY8|3|Plastic, but worth the cost.
B000CO86BY|1|The hinges were rusted when they arrived and the pin holding the stopper in place was rusted out in one of the jack stands .  This prevented the jack stand from staying in place.  I am glad that I tested them out before putting them under my car because this is very dangerous!
B001C6SF2G|5|direct replacement
B0016C1Q22|5|very good product and time to deivering
B006NOFKMU|5|Perfect fit, seems like a strong motor. Turns over efficiently.
B00A7WAHTU|5|If you're working on a Japanese motorcycle, these are a must. The fit is fantastic and I didn't slip a single screw. The best way to tell if a screw is a JIS and not a phillips is if there is a little dot punched on the head between to of the X legs. Also worked great for my flat screen TV.
B00G0LJNAQ|3|Worked perfect! 6-30-16.  After not quite a year broke again.     it should be made of metal not plastic!! Cracked again
B009ZXCSO4|5|Did real good refreshing my reclining chair. I would recommend it to anyone looking to treat their leather or vinyl chairs etc.
B00B1TNQCS|5|Perfect fit and high quality!
B008FCFRIK|4|Good flaps at a decent price. Used them on my 2008 Chevrolet Silverado.
B008KM81E2|5|Awesome stuff. Make sure you shake well till it becomes liquidy. Small area (2x2) at a time. No sun. Unbelievable shine. Beads like no other.
B00XM7JOBE|5|Works great looks nice!
B00KRQWZ9Q|5|AAA
B004K9FZFC|5|Works like oem since it is oem came in factory packaging too
B0068ERNNE|5|Fit as expected. Aririved the same day that the rain fell from the sky...perfect
B006VEHO8U|5|These are wonderful, and exactly what I was looking for. It took seconds to take them from the package and put them around the seat belt.<br />Well made item, excellent workmanship.
B00062YABC|5|very good
B00852684M|5|I love this but my kids love it more.
B000CN713O|5|very good
B0016KFY0O|5|Worked out great
B0051MYLS4|4|good but you need deep wheels to get the full affect to cleaning.
B003GZB45Q|5|GOOD DEAL
B00AFWP5U8|5|We loved them!
B0092POHCQ|5|Works great!
B00GSGGEYQ|5|love this!
B001126PY6|5|Great product easy installation
B00XVUWI5Q|4|worked great for fixing my hyperflash.
B00QN95ODA|5|Received just as described.
B00336XFK0|4|Excellent quality and comes with a high quality case. This sunshade is a bit small even though they are OEM. I'd say that there's about 1 inch of space above the window when placed. You do have to use your shades to hold these in place.
B00KGKK220|1|Title of the product said Light Blue, but descriptions and links to this product advertised it as light black or smoke black 35% so I expected the description to be correct and the fact that light blue was listed in their options twice. Needless to say I received a different product that I was expecting to and won't buy again.
B00UZ0OHIQ|2|The module works as expected, no problem there.  However there are many of their customers using it in metric countries, or using it in the States who prefer the metric system.  They have been saying for OVER TWO (2) YEARS that they will add metric to a future international version of their app.  Really, an honest question, just how hard would it be, and how long would it take, to release an interim version of the app supporting metric as an option?  Two (2) YEARS!  Come on!  They are treating their customers VERY poorly!  I'd say that 99.9% of apps that involve distance support optional metric/US distance.  Why does this one company REFUSE to show respect to their customers who have paid them $99 for an otherwise quite good item?  If you need metric, or would just like to see it as an option, you'd be wise to check out one of the many other available products from companies which don't ignore long, long, long running customer requests!
B00HD9V5IM|4|Came on time and fit the make and model of my car.
B00B9ZK6IQ|2|I bought these because one of the rear mud flaps got broken on a snow bank. The mud flaps that were on the truck new (factory installed) are bigger than the ones that I received, these do not fit and are not the same size. I have a 2012 Nissan Frontier 4x4 SV King Cab and I would like to know if anyone else had this problem?
B00AQTAWEY|5|So far so good!  I didn't experience any of the negative aspects of this unit that the others did.  I got a full charge in just several hours (not over a day like others were reporting).  The unit is lightweight, very portable, and will certainly come in handy when you find yourself in a pinch.  I especially like the quality of the clamps, which are more heavy duty and completely clad in durable polymer versus some of the other cheesy clamps with very thin jaws like I've seen on other units.<br /><br />My only gripe would be the case (which was mentioned in other reviews as well).  Its much too large for what its housing and the molded inserts and foam just flop around.  The item is overall a great product and the case, which needs improvement, isn't worth deducting a star.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for a review.
B0010G30UK|5|Exactly what I needed. Works great.
B001KQAA44|5|Good so far.  Well made and went on fine.  Time will tell how long it will last.  Its fine so far.
B000P4WYKK|5|Thanks
B00JHK81X2|5|Huge fan of top gear, and this kit has everything I need. I keep it in my miata and it hardly takes up space in my trunk. It is very useful, and the stig sticker is awesome!! I will buy it again as gifts for a couple of my friends..
B001MV1LE0|5|These things are awesome
B001CYG6XS|1|Still can't get it to work correctly!
B00D504UP8|5|working very good I have no problems
B00BFDJ17O|5|very good
B00Q7Q9890|5|Nice socks!
B000CONUJM|5|HIGH QUALITY. WORKS GREAT. REPLACING WORKING ONE STOLEN FROM ME, BOUGHT IN 1652
B00YIH6LJU|5|So I ordered this sticker because I was thinking it would be funny.. This review is not primarily about the actual sticker though, which was what I expected it to be when I opened the envelope, EXCEPT, for the fact that I did not notice that I had ordered the sticker in black, when I actually intended to put it on our tinted windows instead of the actual car I would have needed white. So that being the case, I immediately sent a message through amazon, They responded quickly and offered to get me a white sticker. I wished I had an easy button or something because it was really just that easy!<br /><br />P.S. just be aware when you are ordering the sticker, they offer it in many different colors, so don't make my mistake and order something that won't work.
B000GOHUVW|4|So far so good. Pleased with the Price and the Fit.  A third the cost of OEM.  A slight drone at higher fan speed but pleased overall.
B009MCU412|5|Super easy install. I installed this and a yoshimura fender eliminator at the same time, left the factory blinkers on the bike. Looks great, definitely brighter and makes a big difference at night.
B009HQ6NIQ|5|Just what I needed at the best price with fast delivery
B000EDOSNI|5|Thank you.
B00AL1KK9Y|4|Open it up when you get it and practice folding it back up!  The directions are clear but a little practice in the comfort of your home will save you a lot of frustration.
B0066QQWA4|5|I love paying a fraction of the OEM parts and getting something that fits right and works right.
B00CASDZKC|5|Thank goodness I found these kick mats! My three-year-old doesn't kick the back of the front seat, but she loves to extend her legs straight and use the back of the seat as a foot rest. Since I currently am leasing my car, I try to keep it clean where I can. It was too difficult remembering to have my daughter remove her shoes each time she got in the car.<br />I currently drive a Honda CRV. The mat fits and covers the entire back of the front seat. It has never slipped at the top or on the sides. It remains smooth and looks nice. Plus it is much less time consuming to wipe down the mat than to scrub the seat back. I appreciate that there were two mats in the package. I only need one right now, but it's nice to have a spare.<br />I love these mats!
B00RMP2888|4|Nice mirrors for the price. My only problem was hardware that is supplied DOES NOT fit stock Harley Davidson Sportster controls (too short). Approximately 2 week shipping time.
B00NT5VDZ4|4|Very well made!
B005QZDU1K|5|over a year still going strong
B0058TF7DI|4|Fits well on top of the car, Timely delivery !
B00BZQZBAC|2|Good idea, poor materials and operation.<br />I like the idea, definitely. However, there are two pretty big caveats that caused me to replace these door catches within two weeks of use. First, the plastic rings on both door catches broke...in half...within a few days of each other. I don't kick the doors open, nor does my wife, and yet these things split with regular force being used to open the door. That alone was enough to HAVE to replace them. The design is such that a metal ring really should be used in order to sustain regular use of the doors. Second (and this was an issue I could've/would've lived with had the catches survived), when the door is pushed open into the &#34;locked&#34; open position, it makes a loud pop, caused by the ring popping into the end of the catch arm. Again, I would've lived with this, even though it was annoying and made my doors sound broken. But, the stupid things DIDN'T last, and so I went with Smittybuilt straps which are working out wonderfully, are silent, and made to last. Don't waste your money or time, go with something that doesn't have plastic components.
B005NLQAHS|5|It works as expected. Very good quality too.
B003D2BXC6|4|A very well made part, good job Edelbrock.
B00318NT1K|5|Great Staff. I love it.
B00O4CV2B6|5|Well made.  I received this as a gift from my wife & was thrilled.  She was a little disappointed because she also gave me $100 meat thermometer & I was more excited about this key ring!  When she bought herself a Jeep....I promptly bought her one of these....& she loves it!
B00I50553E|5|My 2013 F-150 now looks awesome!!!  Great quality and arrived early.
B000AP57U8|3|Good
B000HBGGQ4|5|I love this stuff. I keep it a at my basement wash basin at all times. Gets tough grease and anything really off hands safely.
B0009H51HG|5|Fram always makes great products!!
B002XM51CA|5|Fit and work great look nice too
B00O2O994I|2|But what do you expect for a couple of bucks?
B003CSPK7A|5|I have moderate mechanical skills, and found the install to be pretty straight forward. Tools needed, a drill, 1/2 bit, socket set, and a torx bit to remove molding screws. Some free-form installation is required. On one side you use the existing mounting holes for the exhaust, and on the other you need to drill two holes in the frame. Some plastic trimming required, but not much. Instructions had you remove a peace of plastic on the passenger side, and not re-install, but I just went ahead and trimmed that part as well, and put it back in place. So far so good. Item seems very solid, and well made.
B00VLF1Y2G|1|Returned due to excessive nicks and scratches that had started rusting.
B00BCRMA9Y|4|Said it would fit my Suv but did not so it's already ripping at the seams. But it still looks great. I just know not to buy the ones with head rest in them as my front seat doesn't have them.
B001P2FO08|3|The announces are that as previously posted the bolt threads don't match those of a Jeep Wrangler (TJ or JK); so basically their lug nuts don't work on your studs nor your lug nuts don't match on their studs.  I purchased for the spare tire carrier and managed to make it work, with some annoyance.  I would not use for my primary wheels and instead use the more popular one.<br /><br />But at least this company sales just 1
B008C0WF3U|5|Fits great in my truck.  It is kind of a pain to roll up  (should have longer Velcro) but my best friend has one too and she has gotten used to it and become a pro so I'm sure it will get easier with time.
B0041CDPQO|5|Easy to install
B005EIZNH8|1|Excellent product at a very reasonable price.
B004I142UQ|5|Fits and works, reasonable price.
B00LG07MZE|5|Fits my 2013 Hyundai Elantra well.
B000BYELNC|2|guuud
B000NDQ0O4|5|Fits perfect on my 2003 BMW 330i!
B000IY6URK|5|Bought these for an '07 Hyundai Elantra GLS.  I had no problems installing them as the length was fine on all of them.  Car runs great and I hope to get many miles out of them.
B007BYUXA0|3|Oxygen sensor it wasn't fit properly it okay
B002MQOXGW|5|At first this did not work correctly.  It would give the correct tire pressure but would not hold the reading. It immediately began to leak.  I unscrewed the hose end, found a spring and 2 small discs (clear plastic and black, black goes on the top) - the black disc was upside down and would not seal.  I turned it over, reassembled, and now it work perfectly. I also stretched the spring out a little longer for a tighter seal.  Great for motorcycles with spoke rims where it is a tight fit.
B000E2CVIS|5|The build quality is very nice. I liked that the bottom was plastic sealed so no manufacturing junk could find its way in. The welded on nut is a very nice touch as well.
B00KTR4T2Y|4|Love the sound...wanted to get it professionally done in case it didn't fit well but my mechanic said it was a good fit. Now all I have to worry about is it rusting...few days on but already seeing some rust. Can't complain though ..best bang of the buck
B00I3F38OY|5|Much better fit.
B00E1SMN5W|5|Excellent I will recommend it .
B00CXAHQHK|5|Boyfriend loves them and have been getting compliments on where to get them
B003WOIT04|5|right ones...yea!!!  Its a toilet, what the heck
B000R8F47Y|5|Held everything in place on a trip going 70-80mph. Was a bit large for the 6' bed of the Frontier but the adjustable hooks allowed the net to tighten across the truck bed.<br />When first removed for the packaging there is a strong 'plastic' odor; leaving the net out of its carry bag for a while helps a lot with the strong smell.
B00K7HEJ62|5|Perfect replacement. A bit spendy but what can you do? Made my glass door work again.
B000BUU5Z4|4|Worth the 3 bucks.
B002XYT2HI|5|Fit perfectly and works well.
B005992NCU|5|Andersen makes first rate products, and this was no exception.
B00MML00GO|2|Thin Cheap oversize rags.
B0068EROF6|5|Shipping was quick...no, make that lightning fast!  The rainsuit looks well made and fits great. I'm going on a trip this week so if I have the opportunity to use it I will update this review.
B00BTLEJXI|1|Initially, we were excited to get these seat covers for my son's first car. The car had leather seats, and in the hot desert sun, we hoped these would keep the seats from getting too hot to sit on. My son picked these out as they looked &#34;cool&#34;, they matched the colors of the car, and were just sporty. They were easy to install and the company's installation videos and documentation were helpful and easy to understand. We followed all the instructions to a &#34;T&#34;, including putting the &#34;airbag tab&#34; on the window side so the airbag could deploy if needed.<br /><br />Two weeks after installing the seat covers, my son and daughter were in a roll-over accident. Fortunately, they are okay, other than some cuts and abrasions, but the airbags on the sides of the seats did not deploy properly. In fact, they were prevented from deploying because of the seat covers. It's just a good thing they didn't sustain any permanent injuries or worse.<br /><br />I will never purchase seat covers from this company again. I just wouldn't feel safe using them.
B003ZA8WIE|5|I have a 2006 Toyota Solara and these ramps work great. Just make sure you use them on flat ground.  The first time I tried them out, I was on the part of my driveway that sloped down a little and my car hit the ramps. I moved them back a few feet and they work perfectly. It's not easy to find a flat spot when you live on top of a hill.
B000OQ3Y62|4|Tool looks good value for the money. I used it for the first time today and it worked as expected, I will be using it again tomorrow and I know that it will be used a lot over the next 6 months and I will report on its performance then. I took a star off as the case is cheep and broke in shipping. I know that I will have to modify the case or make a new one.
B00651CLCS|4|Great that it's so short but it doesn't get the same reception as original tall antenna.
B003BYFT9O|4|Product purchased for my husbands truck. It has a lot of storage space and is the perfect height for my husbands arm to rest on while driving.<br />Well made product.
B00SQTJZDK|1|Didn't work on my Volvo s60r
B00NF0G08I|4|A lot bigger that what we thought!! You surely won't lose you keys!!
B00LEX5MH8|5|As described.  Clean looking and good price. Fast shipping with prime!
B001C6OZ48|5|easy install, works great.
B00R5BKHCS|4|Does this kit include both front control arms?
B000CSNK7U|5|It fit wonderfully on my 2005 Chevy z71
B00FPTMLA8|5|great stuff
B006GTRYJY|5|Fitting perfect, delivery on time. Price good
B00429YAA6|5|For the price you can't beat it, its a excellent product for the price.
B000B5QFE4|5|Look almost as good as factory installed, were a breeze to put on  & help greatly when towing my trailer.
B004PL1Q0I|5|Love the sound, installed quickly bc I ordered a new v band clamp....one hanger placed incorrectly and was unusable but overall you can't beat magnaflow products
B006J7E2ZW|5|Awesome decal!
B007MSDYFQ|5|Was a perfect fit .
B00CNEQZHS|4|These worked great on my 2002 Chevy Suburban. They were easy to install and it only took about 3 minutes!
B004Q3Q7QI|4|They do protect my palms from getting blisters, so that's great.  After some long rides my palms feel like they're about to develop blisters but don't, though they get sensitive a bit.  Good thing is that it's giving my palms time to develop that tough skin.  Though, there are times I feel the protector starting to bunch up a bit so I feel I'm losing some grip.  A quick adjustment then it's fine (maybe I just need new gloves too).
B001RBX774|5|So sweet !!
B000GUYB2W|5|Super
B0075JYPNM|5|Love :)
B00BC3727S|5|This helmet not only looks cool but it is functional. Truly low profile.  Feels good on your head. Now there are reviews that say the wind pushes the helmet up at high seed. Not true, if you have it secured to your head properly. The measurement guide works perfectly. I have gotten many complements on the helmet.  Its Worth getting, could not be happier
B00UW4DNEO|5|Brightech exceeded my expectations not only as a product but as a company.  I bought the scorpion primarily to jump start my car that was sitting for over one month in the garage. After following the instructions I was easily able to connect to battery. I was hesitant due to its size but it worked very well. The added bonus in my opinion is to use the sun charging kit that currently works on most cell phones.  I was able to charge my phone and several others with no problems.  Due to its size I use ity very often as my go to emergency charger.  I feel comfortable knowing that I do not have to rely on others for a jump. If you still looking for a reason to buy this item or one of the competitor's, the scorpion sons hands down due to the amazing customer service. They stand by their products!
B000R5CPAQ|5|excellent product for price
B007AHH4R8|5|Great!
B0009JKISG|5|very good cleaner, easy on the leather and works best when applied before applying the conditioner.
B00BD4NI7E|5|Great product
B00XHPLL44|5|Good quality, easy to DIY! Great!
B00BEY9TG2|5|Exact match on my 06 wrx.
B000C9QU5I|4|This product fit my 2005 Chevrolet Uplander. My ABS and Brake service lights were on. I replaced my brakes but it didn't help so I ordered this during the July sale and it came in very quickly. My mechanic put them on. All service lights have now gone away and my braking is now firmer. Excellent product!  EDIT: I forgot to mention in my original post that I had also heard the humming noise that is common with a bad wheel bearing on my front passenger side. Humming is now gone.  EDIT 3/8/16: I have had these since August 2015. Shortly after having them installed by my mechanic my ABS started going off randomly again. The dealer is saying I now need ANOTHER Driver side assembly; labor and parts to the tune of $600 +. Not sure if the one that got put on the front is defective, my mechanic just said he replaced it after it being such a pain to take one off, or if the dealer is trying to bleed me for money since i'm a girl. Just FYI.
B00VNBDVOC|5|Lights worked better than expected and couldn't be happier.  I installed these in a 2000 Honda Accord that had terrible lights.  I had previously used Sylvania Ultrastars, but they burnt out in 6 months and were not much brighter than standard halogens.  These lights however are 'light' years ahead of the halogens.  I only installed them for my low beams, but my high beams are now virtually useless as these lights are bright enough that the high beams don't make a noticeable difference.  As far as the longevity goes I can't comment as I have only had them for a week.  Hopefully I get at least a couple years out of them.  P.S. Photo is showing just the LEDs.
B002IVCR6Y|3|I bought it because my other one was squeaking. This one did the same thing. A little less, but didn't solve my issue.
B004I1696G|5|Awesome
B002LCD9XU|5|I have had this on my cars rear window for a couple years and it's still going strong/looking great
B0001CLG0A|5|Grazie di tutto tutto ok
B000CGRR4E|4|Bolted right up no problems and no leaks. Couple months now and still holding.
B00HLK5I4K|1|The fit on this helmet is terrible. I was pretty happy with my open face Zamp but this full face doesn't cut it. The padding is terrible, it never fits right and the comfort is awful even for a budget helmet. Venting is just adequate but that doesn't make up for the other flaws on this helmet.<br />Also be aware of some vendors offering free shipping, if you have to return the helmet they will charge you not only for return shipping but also the original shipping cost (which is not free).
B0010GG7YG|5|Works great and was easy to install!
B0063OQS3A|5|Fit perfectly.
B000I66JEM|5|Nice design.  Does store a small amount of items, but it is a 2&#34;x 2&#34; hole, can't expect much more
B001KVW6EQ|5|Got as a gift for my father. He said it worked perfectly and was a big help on his overseas flight.
B007P84W9K|5|Great value for the money
B0016KGZZW|5|I was looking for a quality receive hitch to install on my 2010 Chrysler Town and Country.  My other vehicle has a Curt brand on it and I've had no complaints.  The reason I went with Reese this time is because of how they have the item advertised on Amazon.  Curt has this overbearing &#34;warning&#34; that &#34;NO ADDITIONAL HARDWARE IS INCLUDED&#34;.  That was a turn off for me.  Reese didn't say anything about no hardware/mounting bolts included so I went with them.  Little did I know, you don't need any additional mounting hardware, you use what is already on your car!<br /><br />Maybe I missed it on the product detail pages, but it would have been nice if both Curt and Reese would actually mention that to install you use existing hardware from the vehicle.  Either way, I am totally happy with this receive hitch and would gladly recommend to anyone.
B001EOV492|5|Fast delivery, just what I expected....
B0051D3MP6|5|Really nice just what I needed
B003UPVRMM|3|Okay.  Seem like a one or two time only use though.
B00WQSJGC2|5|Nice extra on 1990 chevy truck.
B00ZE9BKBA|4|Great soap mixer for car wash and more!  This is not a plastic sprayer at all, and from the way it is built, I would say it is here to last. I used it for washing the car and the foam was great on the lowest setting, maybe too much. Because of this, is why I gave it a 4 star rating, I think it needs a lower setting because I just about ran out of soap before the end of washing my SUV. This sprayer mixes water in to the soap to displace the soap in to the spay mixture, so as you are washing, the mixture of the soap is bring watered down to the end of your wash. I wish it was sucking up the soap out of the container without having to mix it water so that you use the same water to soap ratio for the whole wash.
B002N5W8Q4|1|I would actually give this piece of crap a 0 star rating.  The box that the 2 D-cell batteries are supposed to fit into was too small.  It doesn't matter if you put one battery in at a time or try to put both in at the same time they don't fit.  It would be similar to trying to put a size 12 foot into a size 10 shoe.  Once we were able to force the batteries into the box and make a contact with the wires the thing didn't even come on.  It is very flimsy and not well made.
B000CN5ERY|4|Fits upper ball joints and tie rod ends on NA (90-97) Miatas and suggested by forum users. To install, you have to cut off all the old rubber, and these just slip over, held in place when the upright is bolted down on top of it. Good replacement for cracked boots, packed with fresh grease. The polyurethane should be more durable than the OEM rubber as well.
B00LSBX0FM|5|😊
B0058WXNOK|3|There has to be an easier way than to use heat to set this product. While it ultimately worked, the little heat sink tool cools way too rapidly. I found the whole repair took too much effort, although the ability to mix colors to match the upholstery was great.
B00SJTQTDQ|5|Best product on the market, easy to use and it does tune the bike well with the standard canned maps
B000P17NXQ|5|Awesome brake controller. Easy to use and install
B00651CLCS|1|I get less than 1/2 the stations I got with the factory antenna.  Reception with this antenna sucks.
B00ALO5TBA|5|Good and cheap
B00B2YHHZY|5|Replaced all the bulbs on my sail boat with LED's. These were great interior replacements and are very bright. Used these in the head and galley. I used other LED's that are a bit warmer for general interior lighting.
B000R308RA|5|Looks Great on My Truck !! Easy to install. Great Price  Thank You
B008BVVY6O|4|These are good quality seat covers, im actually a little scared of buying online but im glad that i bought these covers. very helpful as well i did have a slight problem but they were quick to fixing tge issue. (:
B004HE6UPO|5|Great product and super fast shipping
B00HAMP5Y2|5|Great product and great customer service.
B00H47K2XC|4|Rotors work as they should, not issues with them. However, shipping to A LONG time.
B00X9CCSEW|5|Looks great on my truck! My dog rides along extra proudly, with her head held high.
B003WZRLZ2|3|The tool works okay, well, most of the time.  It's construction is not very rigid.  It flexes in use, which causes it to slip off the fastener sometimes. It also doesn't have much leverage; you have to apply a lot of force to the tool, and finally the fastener will snap loose rather violently. The tool will sometimes pinch your hand when that happens. I would look elsewhere if buying again.
B00065L2D8|5|Great price.  Works real good.  I have no power on one of my properties, and no cig lighter in the car.  So, with this I can charge my phone, and mp3 players all I want.
B001ILIQW4|5|Perfect
B009AFFY9I|5|worked great
B004J9FVV6|5|Direct fit, easy install and really strong. Door opens by itself after a certain point, which is handy. Stays open against the wind, which is also handy. Seems to actually be of higher quality than the factory replacement. Worth the extra couple of bucks.
B000EQ95X8|5|Fit my 2008 f150 and worked perfect! Thanks
B00HVGG94W|5|It's working very well for me!  Super comfortable and the perfect about of cushion.
B000CH5LMS|5|does what it says
B00GSAUHB8|5|Timely delivery, fits perfectly in my 2003 Camry, and awesome, awesome customer service!
B00LFL8PEG|5|Affordable and still going strong
B00O8JSOO8|2|Low quality aftermarket,the OEM is made a lot better.
B00T6B5U4K|5|Beautiful plate, fast shipping
B00DJ3SBII|1|Wrong part. Will not fit a 2012 Suzuki SX4 as stated.
B00M9UJ1K4|4|Very easy to apply. The only down side is it looks 'goopy' but does the job and color matches well.
B0024NSMWY|3|The assembly was not hard to install.  After installation, the bulbs had to be readjusted.  In the future, should include instruction on how to realign the headlights.
B001DRNA1U|5|Excelent product
B001CQMGIA|5|Great product. Easy set-up. Good price.
B00WOT3YM6|3|The digital pressure gauge is slow to respond and likely not accurate, and as the name suggests it's only an &#34;inflator&#34; - as in, it won't deflate your tires if you set a pressure and your tire is at a higher pressure. Nonetheless, you get what you pay for. Works satisfactorily.
B0042KL7OM|5|Great, thanks A+. Perfect speeds. great to handle, long enough cord! I use it for headlights, and car polishing and sanding in hard too reach or small areas. Pro results!
B007HYAUZW|1|I bought a few and less than half of them work!!! What a rip-off!!! Not worth the money or the hassle!
B0009JB7GI|5|Great, thanks A+
B00ODM4I90|5|These are heavy duty RV chocks that will not slid.  Work great.
B0009IQWJ6|5|Came as you see in the picture.  Price was VERY reasonable at almost 50% off from brick & mortor businesses.  Slid right in with no problems
B0084UJHJI|5|Like it
B000WJVG8E|4|Nice hardcopy manual.  I haven't used it much yet, but the first chapter was interesting to read about the history of their motocycles.
B000CMFULU|5|Works good
B004I12F14|5|great buy
B007ZU498M|5|It is heavy but it does the job.
B001IA9UV6|5|Bolted right on to my 2008 International ProStar with the Cummins motor, if it matters. Much better ride than the International OEMs I have been running. Paired these up with the Gabriel 89458 adjustable GasSLX Shocks. The truck rides like a dream.<br /><br />Update, 10/17 Shocks are still performing, no leaks and tires wearing fine. Going to replace these with same before winter hits.
B00KOCSPCO|5|Fit was perfect. Looks better than the pictures. By far the best helmet i bought.
B002UCYRZU|5|AAAAA
B008N6YRTS|5|I bought them as gifts fir my daughter & 2 daughter in laws as they all run together. The girls got a real kick out of them & each girl placed hers in a different area.
B00NZI6IXC|5|Awesome the ladies love it
B00ELJ9BXI|5|Fun!
B0012NYGDQ|5|very good
B00YI7OJG2|5|Bulb was everything I expected from Quicksilver! Very happy.
B000BVRZ74|4|Amazing results...But, difficult to apply.  Make sure you read the instructions, it takes multiple steps to apply it correctly.
B00RH74IF2|5|There was a recall on my 2013 super tenere to I stall this kit, for free, I decided it would be more cost effective to do it myself, as taking my bike to the dealer waiting three days then going back and picking it up would cost more than the 1 hour it took me to install this kit!
B00APOA2P4|5|Very clean lines.  The frame is not too thick.
B000EDOSMO|4|It's a perfect fit. Amazon is the only place I could find this replacement part for my RV.  Thanks!
B0002NIJPI|5|They're awesome!
B006P86XV6|5|Good quality.....fast shipping
B000CNJ060|1|Wrong gasket set
B004JPHE92|2|The motor looked great and installed quickly and easily.  However, I had to replace it, as it vibrated at anything higher than half-speed (blower fan set to &#34;3&#34; or &#34;4&#34;).  Requesting and getting a replacement went seamlessly, and Amazon was very easy to work with.  However, within just a couple of weeks the replacement started making the same vibration noise when at speed &#34;4&#34;.  This time, by the time I got online to request a new one, I was outside the replacement window and unable to get a &#34;good&#34; motor.  I don't know if I got 2 bum motors, or if these are faulty as a rule, but I'll look elsewhere to get the next replacement.
B00AVNAP7E|4|Not exact match, but very close. More than enough paint for basic Touchup.
B006GLEBIO|5|I bought 2 sets to cover the bottom of a 26ft camp trailer. VERY easy to instal and they look great. I hooked them up to a battery just to make sure they were all working. I was worried that having 2 separate control boxes and remotes would be a problem but it really isnt. They start from off at the same point every time so they do stay pretty much in sinc and either remote will run both sets. As for how long they will last? Time will tell but for the price its a no brainer.
B002JCYUL2|5|This intake makes the turbo sound amazing!!! Definitely better sound coming from the engine and power. Worth the money for sure.
B001JDE6ZW|5|Perfect fit for my 99 Wrangler and super easy to install. Great way to keep the jeep street legal when the doors are off.
B0002UQAXY|3|The velcro backing started ripping off after a year.
B0009YDQEE|5|good buy!
B0041TQU14|5|great PRICE !!!!!
B000GZPCYI|4|Don't know how I ever lived without this tool. A great addition to my toolbox. Works well for the price.
B00435O4K0|1|This is perhaps the worst nozzle I have ever purchased.<br /><br />The fatal flaw in the design is that the circular rubber washer cannot form a seal to prevent it from leaking where it connects to the hose.  Inside the nozzle, there is no flat area for the washer to compress against for a seal.  So, it does not matter how tightly you screw it on, it will not seal.<br /><br />If you decide to try to use it even if it's leaking down your arm, the nozzle takes two hands to operate.<br /><br />Compare this (Chemical Guys ACC2007) dog to the fantastic Gilmour 06WJ Jet Stream Water Nozzle: Single-handled operation, no leaks, lightweight, dependable and less-costly. The Gilmour has been my goto nozzle for years and I keep going back to it.  I just got the 12-pack for about $25!<br /><br />When you try to operate the nozzle by turning the mechanism clockwise to get a spray, you can't.  It opens COUNTER-clockwise; exactly opposite all the other nozzles I own.<br /><br />Other than being a leaky failure, the construction seems to be solid.<br /><br />I would not recommend this nozzle to anyone.
B004VDSKIG|5|Very happy customer the chrome finish is perfect super shiny and they look great and fit great
B006T3D7C0|5|Arrived on time and in good condition. Price pretty much the same as other major retailers of these type products. Intstalled easily after tire and wheel removal. Looks awesome!
B0012TZ04E|1|sock fits better
B00B9Z86F6|5|Awesome product, fit like a glove. Very happy and pleased.
B00FYX2WEU|2|The covers were installed in a 2004 Nissan Frontier. The fitment guide says these are a correct fit for the vehicle.<br /><br />The front seats installed like any other covers: fitment on the seat bottom was acceptable, nearly look stock; fitment on the seat back is not as nice as the side bolsters hold out the material and a 3-4 inch space between the cover and the seat. Overall the front seats I'd give a 3.5 -  4 star rating.<br /><br />The back seats are a completely different story. The seat bottom fits well, much like the front seat. The seat back does NOT fit at all . The seat cover is made for a seat with removable headrests, in this model Frontier the head rest is built in to the seat back. This is highly disappointing since now my interior doesn't match. The rear seats I'd rate a 0 stars as they are completely unusable.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to do with this, it's probably not worth the trouble of removing and returning. No word on longevity as they were just installed; the material seems thin but may hold up fine..
B00O8JT13G|5|Exact replacement.
B004GC7A24|5|Good description. Fast delivery. Good price
B0050CVEWQ|5|GREAT QUALITY
B003SS62PS|1|This is the first time I've had a problem ordering something from Amazon and not sure if I'll place<br />and future orders. This fan is the noisiest thing I've ever heard, you certainly couldn't carry on<br />a conversation with this thing on, it's that noisy. I probably won't return it because I've paid<br />shipping to receive so I won't pay additional to return. I'll probably just toss it and call it a<br />day and chock it up to a bad purchase. Definitely won't recommend this to anyone EVER.
B00EVY3RQU|5|Great bang for the buck. Saddlebags are a perfect size for the rebel.
B006JD481Y|4|Exactly like was mentioned
B008CSUTBM|5|Perfect mod for my BMW.
B0015BMYBQ|5|thanks again
B000S2IWZK|5|very good
B00H9Z3FVU|5|Professional grade look-and-feel. Did not smell at first use. I use it to run 230V equipment in the USA.  So far (after 4 wks) no problems, with the heaviest use being a combination of a 700W espresso maker (heater only) and a 120W tablet charger.  Very solid packaging (3 layers of cardboard boxes).  Long term reliability as yet unknown, will update eventually.
B00SBZAG5U|5|Fits nicely but needs lower screw hole covers
B00BFUADXI|5|Excellent, but slow shipping....after the expected date.
B00R8EWV9O|5|Just what I was looking for
B00C2SMAVA|3|Worked well in my Jeep wrangler, Look cheaply made, but they do their job for the price.
B004NA7UY2|1|They didn't come with any mounting instructions(which they are pretty self explanatory though). They have 3M tape pre Attatched to the vent shades where all you need to do is clean the surface, peel and mount. I did exactly that and now after a couple of weeks they tape is coming off of the product. On 2/4 windows. Poor construction, look ok but are very flimsy.
B003POHULA|3|A little overpriced, Had to trim the foam but I guess this is meant to be a universal fit so can't really complain.
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Looks great.
B00804IETW|4|very nice and using in my car at dhaka
B000CQHVJA|2|Advertised as a Walker part and shipped from Amazon, but NOT a Walker part.  A brand called Exhaust Mate, made in India.  It may do the job, but the product is not as advertised.  I have found that quality rubber made in the USA, Europe, Japan and Canada far outlasts the stuff made in China or India.  I have made the mistake of buying Chinese and Indian made tires, only to watch them dry rot within 15 months - something I have never had happen with Michelins, Bridestones or Continentals.  May end up using my 22 year old OEM Nissan Japanese made rubber hangers instead, depending upon their condition.
B00H9S71LW|5|Works as advertised.<br />Well constructed.<br />Connects easily.<br />Instructions explain how to connected bluetooth.<br />The android app showed me the engine code and showed a brief description.
B0040CRTK8|5|was just what i needed. worked perfectly.
B0002SR7SS|5|Perfect pan when trying to be a flat rate technician. Instead of leaving the car racked in the air when draining coolant I drain the coolant into this pan and Lower the car so I can continue working on the car while it drains. Saves lots of time!!
B00KRQFTF8|5|Didn't know these even existed,glad I found them. They came fast and they're pretty high quality
B00E6AAXMA|5|♡♡♡
B00B0C7PJG|5|I am amazed by their customer service. I recently purchased their rotors and Ceramic pads (my first time trying them and then pulled a bonehead move (please don't judge I have done many brake jobs successfully). As embarrassed as I am to admit I put in a pad backwards and tore up a rotor. I called them to purchase a replacement due to my error. They not only said they would replace the rotor and ceramic pads free of charge they two day aired them to me. Very impressive!!!
B002SE1GGS|3|I've had three Nissan Muranos, and had regular Ventvisors on the first two.  They worked great and kept rain out with the window open almost two inches.  I saw these low-profile seamless Ventvisors and thought they would look much better than the traditional set, which is true - they look great.  The problem is that they are so close to the window a(nd there is a little lip on the inside edge) that water drips in if the window is open more than about a half inch below the edge of the visor.  While the look of these is much more appealing, if I had to do it over again I would stick with the traditional set.  They stick out a bit more, but they worked better for me.
B00L8BO5PG|4|ok
B00YF4FETY|4|I believe so, there are some other issues with the car as well
B000BUTD9S|5|Do just what they say.  Look good and improve traction.
B008H183K8|5|2 thumbs up
B00G620ZVU|4|Perfect . .I like! Good seller!
B0062WC9IQ|5|relay fit and works perfectly, thank you, relay is of good quality
B0066S3WJG|3|This part fit my Discovery II just fine, but it didn't align well enough with the release pin to work.  I had to glue a piece of plastic to it to hold it in the right position permanently.
B008BTN7EI|1|This item DID NOT work and actually made the balance worse.<br />Save your $$ and just get your tires professionally balanced.
B00HEZYVYA|4|Bright enough for daytime but not blazing.
B001U8KNQM|5|Very good
B000CFAV7K|3|The back ones weren't even close to fitting our 2000 XTerra
B00VXNK490|2|narrow and short did not give coverage I was looking for. Returned it.
B000CRO4IK|5|Perfect size, very convenient. Quick access, would recommend 100%. Very well made.
B0006SU3QW|5|All purpose spray you can use it on anything also long as you clean the surface first with running alcohol and let it dry, great buy love you can change the look of your car in two seconds, for the job I did I used about a 3/4th of the can be used I did make it thick so I in the future be easy to take off. For rims it's recommend 2 full cans, I can't compline, great investment, easy to apply, anyone could do it!
B000EDUUHQ|5|These work great for our camper cabinets!
B003TPWIEY|5|Just what I needed, good price .
B007Z1FSKO|5|I added the wings to a 2013 Genesis sedan.  I read several articles and watched several videos on debadging a vehicle.  I am  not going to repeat the whole process here but to say cleanliness is the key to good adhesion.  The wings have two pegs on the back that match the factory holes in the trunk lid.  The pegs are keyed by shape and size.  It was a simple installation but results in a much more elegant look.
B00L3KDUD0|5|The three sizes work well and allow good cleaning of the inner wheel barrel without worrying about scratching or marring the finish.
B0084UI62W|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2014 evo x. I was a little skeptical at first. But after i got it and put it in, it was a perfect fit. Any one with a evo x should buy this.
B00WH1ZC80|5|Love it!  Makes room for my purse and bags while leaving area in front free for passenger. No more worries about stuff getting between my foot and controls.
B00MGXQL3E|2|The mirror worked fine for 2 months, then the adhesive failed on my BMW windshield.  I followed the installation procedures carefully.  Fortunately, I caught it before it hit the road.<br /><br />The mirror is a nice piece of hardware, and one more way to check your blind spot, and check out your own self as you ride!  Mounted directly in front of you, it will show any traffic directly behind you.  Just your blind spot, pretty much.
B00KPQVWBK|5|Super easy to install. Took about 30 minutes on my Tioga. Looks great.
B00J11R232|5|great fit
B0016KC3T4|4|Good price, easy to install.
B009YFELLQ|2|does not work like i thought it would
B002935IV2|5|Works quite well for what it's designed for.
B00IYTUWSE|5|Delivered as promised. Easy install. Better visibility to drive at night. Looking good.
B007N6TXH0|5|works great. quick bolt on. Already saved my back hauling the yard trailer around
B00NFSNAS8|5|High quality product. It comes in a convenient travel case with every type of nozzle I have ever encountered.
B000C2AC0E|5|Quality Gasket for My 67 Camaro 327 great price.
B00IKVRCBQ|1|bulbs are different colors... doesnt look good when lights are on.
B00BJCN08M|5|This is really brilliant!  I can move my heavy tool bucket very easily, with no tipping.  Thank you!
B000GD5FMY|5|I can ride with my contacts in. keeps the wind out
B001P11SCM|5|Excellent brakes work great
B00ZGAGNLE|1|I would give this negative stars if i could. This products is a big piece of junk. I embarrassingly spent almost 2 hours trying to make this work and couldn't. It is mis-machined in multiple places to where it wont hold the batteries in place and they wont make solid contact. Junk Junk Junk
B00VSYCZQO|5|These Hub Caps were nicer than anticipated. The blue daisy center matches exactly the blue of the Bug. They fit perfectly, went on perfectly and they arrived very quickly. This was a 1994 base model VW Bug. I certainly recommend these as hub caps for any shade of blue bug.
B00TXRRWSO|5|bad ass thanks
B004IV8NBU|1|Broke off first time
B00P2RYKYS|5|Works perfectly on my van.
B00B0QWXW6|5|Life saver
B001005QIU|5|This stuff works great! can't wait to try it out on the rest of my home!
B00GMO4DC4|5|Very cute in person!
B000UHH6LO|5|I will recommend the product. Good quality.
B00KTFPCVS|5|works like a charm
B00387DX0G|5|Looks just right for my 2000  dodge ram 1500 2wd. Thanx guys..
B00GM4UUZS|5|Nice size, lots of straps.  Fits my Durango perfect!
B006NU3UOE|5|Thanks! It's really cute!
B008F8Q8WS|5|Right fit. Right look...
B00B1VBQRS|5|Outstanding product. Expected from Royal Purple. This is the first time I have used this specific product so I will continue to use it and I can't wait to see the improvements.
B000FPXV5G|3|It mounts perfectly but the cup holders need to be deeper somehow.
B00H7LPKKU|5|Great. Easy to use.
B004C0LSW8|5|Exact replacement of old switch, very EZ install.
B0068SYSP6|5|Excellent Product Much Better than the Husky alternative which was flimsy and curled to a point of no return. Which is what I did, return it, and bought the Toyota product.
B0089VPHZK|5|Arrived well-packed and was easy to install on my 2014 Prius C. With a small lightweight cargo carrier, this hitch gives you the extra storage capacity required for a cross-country trek. For us, this amounted to 5 people, 2 weeks, and over 3800 miles---and we stayed sane because of this carrier.<br /><br />NOTE to Prius C owners: It is important to minimize loading on ANY hitch system used on this car. This attaches to an aluminum extrusion and it is doubtful that Toyota would endorse attaching anything of consequence to the vehicle. This hitch is rated at 150lbs tongue capacity and I recommend never exceeding this and keeping use to a minimum!<br /><br />The only hitch-mounted carrier I found purported to fit the clearance and lift requirements on my Prius C was the Rola 21x55, but since I already had a lightweight Haul Master carrier (Harbor Freight 66983, 33lbs) with good dimensions, I modified my own. I cut the tongue even with the front fence and re-welded it below and set back 6&#34;, giving me a 2&#34; lift and moving the carrier closer to the vehicle to account for the 1-1/4&#34; to 2&#34; adapter (Curt 45785). With modifications, the front fence was 9&#34; back from the receiver hole and the platform top was 3&#34; above it, giving reasonable clearance both from the ground and from the lift-gate.
B000VS8DZU|1|Was about half dried up when I received it.
B00EJPOQRU|5|good service no problems
B007TYNE8A|4|Great replacement light for the price.
B00EPKNGNY|5|Received on time and satisfied.
B00TVROQYE|5|Bought for my sister who is a hair stylist she loved it!
B00EZSTVIU|1|This product looks good, but as soon as i tried to put it on it ripped.
B002AMAXNA|5|Perfect for quick use.
B00EBEV4OW|2|it's noisy, the door isn't easy to open with one hand, gets things a little too warm.
B0014GDGPU|4|pretty cool - colors could &#34;pop&#34; more - prhaps more vibrant would help
B00TO61KIC|5|Awesome
B00B54SJIK|5|Great
B00B3UWUUY|4|Just right
B00FPOSNZK|5|Well made...good quality product. Easy install. Reasonable price!
B00K73X020|5|Pros: Fantastic light.  Works great, no leaks so far.<br />Cons: The large mounting screws are starting to rust so obviously either low grade stainless or plated.
B0058TF7DI|2|Right out of the bag, this looked like a great idea. We have a rooftop cargo basket that we use when we go on camping trips, and having a simple way to secure a tarp on the load would be ideal. Unfortunately, this net is very flimsy. On the first day, the elastic cords started to stretch apart. By day two we had to secure the load and the tarp with straps and bungie cords. The net was pretty much useless. We may keep the plastic hooks and build our own net to the same pattern with higher quality materials, but I wouldn't waste my money on this.
B007JW0XCC|5|I love HK and this is a perfect addition to my collection!
B005H2SXEQ|5|Perfect match for front air dam of a 2000 Cobra R. Very pleased!
B00CP3A1WW|5|The box is smaller and lighter, and the spark is brighter than the OEM part I had. Had to mount it a bit different with a couple washers because it was so much smaller.
B00K73X020|5|Really bright and easy to hook up. I will be looking for more lights soon and will def. consider the other lights these guys have to offer. They are a great price for a great product.
B001AWPQO2|5|This is perfect.  fits exactly, and i used to have such a mess when riding.
B00MEVPQLG|5|Shocked and PLEASED are the words that come to mind when I opened this package.<br /> I was expecting a power charger but this kit is SOOOOO MUCH MORE.<br /><br />1st the prime reason I wanted this is to add it to our ever growing  list of Hurricane supplies.. Living in the Hurricane  territory it is never far from mind and becomes a year round prep. in the event of a  nasty storm.. Also living in the Lightning capital of the USA.. we freq have power outages that last a long time.. So my prime reason for wanting  this are those I have listed.<br /><br />But I never dreamed it would come in such a complete package !<br />A complete package of all the needed  types of connectors you can imagine and then some.. and to top it off it will even charge a dead car battery !<br />...... I promptly charged the battery pack and  after fully charged.. plugged in my cell, and  tablet.. to see how well that went..<br /><br />Perfect ...speedy and completely charged both items w lots of power LEFT OVER for more charging ..WHOO HOO<br /><br />Now, how long will the charge last ??.  I haven't tested it this far but the literature w it says it will hold a charge for MONTHS...<br /><br />So I have recharged it and promptly  placed it in my glove box and set a calendar reminder to RE-CHARGE in 5 months( lets see how much charge is left at that point ))  !!<br /><br />Very pleased with this product and  how complete it is..<br /><br />Now I feel a lot more comfortable having this portable charger......<br />......Delighted..
B00EEDWRYG|5|Excellent plate for the price. Got this for my new Volvo XC60.
B00K87O6IC|2|I had the same issue as another reviewer and was forced to reuse the old top nut and race, not an ideal situation to be forced into with a part that advertises that it fits these bikes when only 2/3rds of the product actually fits.  If you have a PW50 and need the steering bearings replaced, this is not the correct product, keep looking.
B00I552LRM|5|Easy to install. Work great.
B005JZSP08|5|This is perfect for kids in booster seats, making it easier for them to reach all the way down to the buckle.
B00A14QLMG|5|Great product!
B00R7ORA5A|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great
B00GWV57FY|3|the only complaint is that when I charge my phone and listening to the radio it makes the radio static.
B000C9SMDQ|4|Bought for 1994 Camaro Z28.
B000CIQ47S|5|It is a basic spark plug for a basic machine.  I used it in tuning up my Lawn-boy lawn mower.  I only use this spark plug when completing the maintenance and have done so for the last 12 years on this machine.  The mower continues to work like new and all that is required from me is a yearly oil change and ever 2 years a new spark plug and air filter.
B00A6GI104|5|worked great
B001R91QRO|5|Fine sticker - happy to add to my collection on my kayak-mobile.
B000WK248O|5|This fits my noggin really well. I got it to wear under a motorcycle helmet and it is very comfortable. I can't feel the seams at all. I throw it in the wash every now and again which has helped to keep my helmet from getting that typical helmet smell.
B000C2Y58Y|5|Exact replacement; installed easily. Recommend keeping OEM spring clamp on connection to (plastic) radiator fitting to prevent potential  over-tightening and distorting.
B00SDSNNIC|1|jUST WHAT I ORDERED AND EXPECTED. tHANKS.
B000C9SU1A|5|It's an oil filter. It filters oil. Woohoo!
B005F5A6BS|5|I gave these to my boyfriend for his bday and the quality is pretty good! They fit perfectly in his Jeep Wrangler Sahara 2012! Great buy! Really satisfied!
B00Y8TTJ3I|5|Fits my Mercedes steering wheel perfectly. Easy, nice grip. Doesn't get hot under sunshine. I am happy with this product!
B00KAL67KQ|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00CIXMEN8|4|Excellent fit
B007CX6IBI|5|Great
B0009IQZH0|5|Very Useful!
B00CB8WM2S|4|This should do the job. I just wish it were more compact for storage in my car's console. My previous hammer was a great design. Too bad I forgot it was under the driver's seat of my previous car.
B00335JQIQ|2|The reason that I bought this floor mat was for the over the edge cover. It does have very good over the edge cover but the floor mats are much thinner than I expected. If I had to do again ( witch I might do ) is order the Weather Tec Floor Mats, but I haven't seen one so don't know it's thickness.
B00DSD4O26|5|Got for new phone case for my grandson---great!!!
B000182E5K|3|lays too flat
B00JA80PEO|5|Fit great in my HD modular helmet and sounds good at 75mph. I haven't talked on it yet, but that's not what I bought it for. I wanted to listen to music while riding and this fit the bill perfectly. Paired right away with my S6.
B00MB0DOLO|4|On one hand, this is by far the most comfortable steering wheel cover I've ever tried. It has just enough cushioning to be comfortable for my hands, without being so bulky that it gets hard to grip. My one beef with this cover is that metallic part is this thin foil material that covers a clear plastic cord, and the metallic foil erodes relatively easily just due to friction from the hands -- and once the metallic foil comes away (which for me, took about 6 months), the remaining clear plastic looks a lot tackier than what the cover would have looked like if it was just all black.
B00504PFNS|5|GREAT DEAL WORTH THE WAIT
B00P2PJI7Y|5|Fits perfectly on a BMW e90 335i
B00HB9M1JG|5|easy installation!
B0054TQV14|5|Item exactly as described.  Perfectly replacement for the ignition module in my old engine.
B00393VA72|5|The product came as I expected haven't installed them yet so I'm not sure if it's accurate as how it say it is but I have bought from them before an was not disappointed so I know I will be please once I have them installed
B002F4RE1W|5|I got this sticker for my car a while back, but i'm barely leaving my review, so don't mind the picture attached, too much. It's just to show everyone what it looks like. The sticker is still in pretty good shape, even through all the bad weather and things like the heat and humidity. When I first got it I loved the way it shined and  had that chrome look! I also loved how the Longhorn and the letters that spell Texas are separate and not all one big sticker. It's not too small, yet not too big. A must have, if you're a Texas Longhorn fan! I definitely will be buying another.
B00PGUZA6S|5|Great seat covers and they fit perfect!!  I made a mistake while ordering and ordered the wrong rear covers, the seller had no problem exchanging.  Excellent customer service and fast shipping.  The seat covers are better than I expected and do not slide around like ones I have had in the past.  I ordered the black and orange covers and the colors look just like the picture.  Would order again!!!
B00PMXZ1YA|2|These are ok at best...some work...some don't. Thankfully you get a bag because you can sit there and keep swapping them out til you get a good one. I put 4 in the marker lights in the rear of my car...out of the bag 2 did not work fully.
B00NO79ONU|5|Excellent - quality product
B00QN86FC0|2|Decent priced, pretty bright. But when i teceived it and opened the box, they had scratched it and colored over it with a permenant marker. Real disappointed they would treat their customers that way. Id like a replacement light but we all know that wont happen
B00029J4JW|5|Just the right part, thank you.
B000C7VZ0U|5|Exactly for my truck.
B002T4U3Q6|4|Good and heavy duty atv receiver hitch.  I have pulled a 4x8 utility trailer through a clear cut field using my Grizzly 700.  The trailer  had two men riding in it as well as a deer feeder and 250 lbs of corn.  I drove over stumps and small logs and this hitch held up very nicely to the punishment.  (it was a very rough ride to those to men riding in the trailer)  I even crossed a deep ditch and bottomed out the trailer and had to put the atv in 4x4 and spun all 4 tires to get it free.
B001D6T4Q6|5|Bought spoiler for an Evo from this seller for a project car . The sellers had the better offer  over all others.  This spoile is great . I got it for a corolla and installed  it just after it arrived.
B00ZYPU1YG|4|Need to use it more to judge its effectiveness.
B007L6Q1EK|5|This is the good stuff. If you own a Subaru, and you aren't using extra S, than you are probably extra S yourself. and I don't mean Smart.<br /><br />Buy the oil, you are not going to outsmart the engineers at FHI or Subaru with your synchromesh because you have been doing 7,000 rpms launches in your 2002 WRX thinking you are going to impress other 16 year olds on YouTube. You are going to need a new scooby is what you are going to need.
B000JZL1U4|4|Had a little trouble to install it. Otherwise it worked fine so far.
B00UJG9R1I|5|love them. works great on my 2005 GMC sierra. Brighter than stock one's.
B006L74X0O|5|Love Them‼️
B00NTU18KY|5|It works as described.
B0002Z9KE0|5|Works great
B000EVYGZA|1|Without a doubt the worst purchase of my life; this 'unit' fell apart the very first time I used it.  Worst quality item I've ever purchased.  Who are these people writing positive reviews?  Hard to imagine they are real (no disrespect intended if they are).  Can't say whether the functions worked, as the unit felt like junk when I first opened it, and proved it was junk by falling apart immediately.  Was too busy at the time to demand my money back.  Would have.
B0009V1WS4|5|love it
B000NE7TJ8|5|Arrived fast. Gm door panel clip pins
B00UCNCSJ6|5|Great price for a fantastic item.
B00P6OOAC4|2|A somewhat stiffer ride but not uncomfortable.  They are doing their job so far ( 3 mos.), but I can't speak for their longevity.  The price was definitely right.<br /><br />Update: Need replacing after 2 years.
B0073JDIWI|5|I really liked them and apparently a thief also liked them so much that he couldn't wait until he got his own!
B00IUE5OCC|5|Used this on my 2006 WRX, first time cleaning the engine. It wasn't filthy and grimy, just dirty. This is a MILD product, and perfect for my application. Rinsed the engine/bay, sprayed this on, barely scrubbed, and rinsed off. Worked great, and the spray/stream trigger head is great because it let me get the cleaner in hard to reach spots. Griot's makes great products, can't really go wrong with them!
B000C7YRNM|5|Used in my 2000 Jeep Cherokee 4.0l when I put a new engine in - because why reuse a thermostat? Holds proper temp accurately according to what I can tell from the dash gauge. I drill a 1/6 hole above the spring to help with air bleeding. Not enough to not allow the engine to heat up, but enough to bleed an air pocket.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Exactly as advertised. Received package pretty fast.
B002JH9P3U|5|Been looking for this for a while one was great the other did not peel off but that could have been me...
B000MD4YKM|5|Good product, works every time and easy to get the grease flowing. Way easier to handle when your under a truck or piece of equipment trying to reach that impossible grease zerk and still be able to pump the grease gun handle. Shipping was fair and very fast.
B00Q3CM2QY|4|Best battery trickle charger around
B00UCTY6UY|5|Disposable floor mats have a water resistant coating on them & are quite durable! I would definitely recommend it for any auto detailer or mechanic looking to protect a customers floor mats while being serviced.<br />A+
B00N9VYVF2|5|just got my chrome rear view mirror they r great  thanks amazon.  i am happy.  deff you can have 5 stars
B000COC67E|5|OK just a little to small for me
B004EIAADG|1|the air compressor on it is terrible!!!!  It shuts off after barely putting 5 PSI in the tires.  Haven't had a chance to use the jumper function yet.
B000COXNW6|5|strong clip
B00BCRMC1U|4|Nice!
B00GSAUHB8|3|The sunshade does what it is inteded for, but the little flaps of material around the main circles don't really set into place that well. I wish I would have gotten one of the dual rectangular ones that overlap instead.
B009IOT59Q|3|worked as discribed
B00DP5KJ44|5|Looks great on the boat
B00CFQQ1LY|5|It fit perfect thanks i would recommend it to someone
B00VNBEBCS|5|UPDATE 11-16-15<br />I have had these in my car now for about 6,000 miles, including a 700 mile weekend trip.  I have had no issues with them at all.  They are really great!  Highly recommended...  :)<br /><br />I installed the H13 kit in my 2008 Suzuki XL7 Limited.<br />Even though the description doesn't explicitly say it, the bulbs are dual beam - they have high AND low beam just as the factory halogens had.<br /><br />One of the reasons I wanted these is because the location of the bulbs in my car is extremely difficult to get to.  I didn't want to ever worry about changing them again.  The install was a pain, but not because of the bulbs.  Once I got the headlight assembly out of the car, it was very easy to install the new LED's.  I have had them in the car for a week now and I am very pleased.  The light pattern is perfect.  The low beam has a really good cutoff, just as the halogens did.  No blinding of oncoming drivers.  They light up the road very nicely, and when you turn on the high-beams it is amazing.<br /><br />So far I LOVE these bulbs.  The color is excellent.  They look amazing, and they are sufficiently bright.  You really have to listen to hear the fans running and you can only hear them when the engine is not running.  There is no downside to installing these LED's and they are worth the price (so far).<br /><br />If the lights fail, I will update this review.  The longevity of LED bulbs was a big factor in my choice to upgrade, so if they fail I will not be happy.
B00AN3PW3Y|5|Perfect wiring kit! went on exactly like the instructions said. Yes the lights didn't work at first but like the instructions say take the fuse out while the trailer is hooked up and the small black box will reset itself and it did.
B0016C3SZK|5|Can't go wrong with Reece. Good price and fast shipping.
B0009ZEUU2|5|Fit 2013 Nissan Juke
B005MZYIZG|5|Great price for a great product, I bought this for my grandpa and he loves it!
B008DR3ZWW|5|My husband loves his helmet. Only thing he uses it for his cbr bike and this helmet is for a dirt bike...sooo he took the top part off
B000T7HE7Q|5|Great lights! Only issue I have is that the wiring harness that came with them wasn't long enough to replace my current wiring, quite easy to install and replace my existing lights. Be aware though that if you have tight tolerances on the trailer with current lights you might have to modify the trailer!
B0074NPGN2|4|Working just fine!
B00NQD21AK|5|Just hope I never have to use it....
B00GRNGBW0|1|dont work
B00LCBJF0W|4|they fit
B000JZSOA4|5|Bought this for my 2005 Subaru Outback 3.0 H6. Old radiator sprung a leak, this new one is an exact copy of the factory radiator. It even comes with tabs for attaching the cooling fans which the factory radiator did not have.<br /><br />Attached photos are the best comparison I have for the factory and replacement.
B000F0QRTS|5|Fots nice
B00252IF9O|4|were exactly what my customer needed.
B002FA5U6W|4|This actually does work.  Any light fog that accumulates quickly goes away.  The rest of my visor is fogged up around the Fog City portion all the time.  When the Fog City actually accumulates water, it is blurry.
B000C9H7HI|5|Used these for a shoe replacement on my 2005 Toyota Tundra. The quality was fine. All necessary dowel posts were already pressed in place making it pretty easy swap into the drum housing. These AC Delco shoes have a lifetime warranty, so make sure you keep the paperwork that comes with them.
B00WSJKZZ6|1|no instructions very cheaply made  returned and as of 8/17/15 still have not got my money back.
B00TPM7UTI|5|works well, great price.
B00EB41CBC|5|great product
B001GE7BIS|4|The seat covers were great, just wish the headrest covers were a little tighter fit. Overall it is a great buy

B002E581AK|5|Exact fit.  Quiet fan.
B003EJF23O|5|Just got mine today! They came by pretty quick. It looks great with my Miata. Definitely will buy more again. Love the way it looks
B003YOVEYA|5|Excellent fit.
B00HJ6P5EO|5|When perfect on my glossy black procomp rims
B00GZLMEN4|5|Great product - got my wife's lower trim BACK TO BLACK !!
B00K23YF2E|5|Worked perfectly for my e36 and passed CA smog with flying colors.
B000IYNWGC|5|Good part. Fixed the fan in about 10 minutes.
B00VAZFTSM|5|Fits 2003 Jeep Wrangler pre 10-2-2003
B009S2VXC0|5|Perfect fit, easy to install. Quality product
B000JI4P7M|5|husband loves it
B004A30F6M|5|fix perfect works good
B00B8ZDE36|5|car cover works great the material doesn't feel like the fabric that i have seen from other owners, it feels like more of a paper fabric but for 80.00 its still a great cover. now when i uncover my car it still looks like its freshly washed no more dust and debris on my car. if you happen to have a big spoiler on your car like i do it will cover 95% of your car just dont count on the bumper being covered.
B002TZOPJ6|4|Size is too small for xlarge.
B0006I0MVS|5|Item came right away. Works like a charm!
B005JZD6KM|3|Read the fine print for measurements!  I didn't do this and now I have an extender that doesn't fit.  :(
B00HORH0RI|5|I put this on my prius,  all my coworkers love it.  Now I just need one for the semi that says &#34;MY OTHER CAR IS A PRIUS&#34;
B000CKN1YK|5|Great product, worked perfectly!!
B00MWFGQ18|5|Good very good
B004I157X2|5|Fit like a glove
B00I7ELQ90|5|Fit our Pontiac Montana perfectly, as if it were OEM filters... and half price of down town!
B0040CTYAQ|4|OK
B001O4CIHY|5|Worth the money !!!
B00514AOCO|5|easy to install works great
B000BPWSFO|5|Item exactly as described.  Perfectly replacement for the old breather on my engine.
B000L6IXLG|3|Great stuff, but a little expensive. I use it for removing hard water lines in the toilet and thinks.
B000CMJS6I|1|I bought this because I thought this would be better than splicing.<br />It took a large amount of force to push my new trailer plug into an existing vehicle plug and I ended up bending all the pins 90 degrees on my first two attempts. One of the pins broke off shortly thereafter. Maybe the pins on this are a little larger then on my vehicle's plug.<br />Also the 48735 dust covers didn't stay on the plug without gluing.<br />Looks like I'm back to splicing.
B00Q0E2WHY|5|Worked and matched my 2004 Titan perfectly.  No instructions but easy install.
B000637TE6|5|It did a great job that has lasted well.
B00AAYYE26|5|Great sound. Loud enough to tell the neighbors I'm home... But not loud enough to wake them. Stellar looks.  Installed it using the factory cat and can tell mild HP gain.  Will get the invidia high flow cat soon.
B0089LT760|5|Excellent fit, better gas throttle response. For only a few bucks more than after market filters, this is completely worth it.
B000GKDTW0|5|Have been using for many years and works great, has great features such as flashing light to let me know the battery is getting low. I use it heavy duty in a mini RV as shown on http://www.offgrid.green
B006YUID6S|2|Its a decent product but make sure the wires are long enough to reach across the front of your car.  Everything looks easy to set up but once I tried to wire it across the front of my G35, the wires were not long enough so I couldnt use it.  Kensun should have made the wires longer.  Better safe than sorry.  If it was too long we could have just bunched it up to make it shorter......
B00VIVGRS4|5|I own 2 other brands of these charging units, the other being a 19,000 Mamp per hour unit.<br />This one is great, because it will jump start any vehicle and also hold a charge so you don't need to have it constantly plugged into AC all the time.<br />Whenever I travel outside my local area, I just toss this unit in the trunk......just in case!<br /><br />I have not tried charging up the cell or running the laptop with this particular unit, but the other I have will keep the laptop running for as long as you want, and I mean DAYS.<br />As for charging up a cell phone, I use it on my Note3, and it will charge the phone up many, many times.....I have never run out of juice charging up the cell phones.
B009GNC5LO|2|It was allright
B000AA4RWM|4|A+++++
B000XY16YW|5|Excellent. No more brake dust on custom chrome rims.
B00BNPDVO8|5|Battery last at least 15 minutes in my lawn blower!  Better than the original battery.
B00DYZ4AW2|1|I would put zero stars if I could. No wires at all on one light and both back covers have holes in them. I know its ised, but the listing says &#34;good condition.&#34; These are absolute garbage.
B00CYLETLY|5|Loved them!!
B0006IX85K|5|Great product great price wonderful seller, Thanks
B0012PGXZI|5|Perfect fit for a hard to find part. We now have AC coming out of the vents it's supposed to on an older S10 Blazer. The screw hole in the actuator arm was a tiny bit oversized for the original screw, so slightly larger sheet metal screw may be required.
B005R6R6DG|5|Buy again and again
B000BYB3J2|3|Being Bosch I thought they'd be a good choice.  They Look Great!  Thick silicone, spiral wire inside and impressive feel! Though the small clip that grips the top of the plug inside the plastic end has disappeared from one of the wires. Still works ~ but ~ does it work like it should? Who can say? But is the set working at Fabled Bosch Expectancy? Probably not! Think I'll order a replacement and see ~ I'll likely go down to NAPA ~;0)
B00CC4LX2G|1|This product did not come with any adapters so it did not fit in my truck. The seller speaks very little English and doesn't know how to put a sentence together making it impossible to talk with him.
B00AC6Y7HE|3|This CL-1010-MG (magnetic) tank bag is amazingly compact and will not interfere with your riding motions or tank fill ups.  To help put things into perspective I am 5'4&#34; tall with an average reach for my height and I don't even notice this bag is there until I look down. The biggest plus for this bag for me was the clear top compartment. I keep my iPhone 6 Plus in there with GPS for navigation. So for those on the same page looking for a place to store your 5.5&#34;/5.7&#34; cell phone this pocket will do phone. It can be difficult to see in direct sunlight as the plastic cover produces some glare but it is well worth dealing with.  My bike is a 2013 Ninja ZX6R 636 and I had concerns about how the top of the tank has a concave but it did not interfere one bit.  UPDATE 8/22/2015: This bag has left &#34;stains&#34; on my gas tank that resemble the grid-like pattern underneath the magnets. They are brown stains and I've tried some soap and water with a detail rag and aren't coming off the slightest bit. I even took it in today for service and had the tech tell me it wouldn't come out using their cleaning solution they use to clean bikes before selling them. I will update with photos.
B001EOV492|5|Well only complaint is mine didn't have the 5/8  pin with it so I'll have to go buy one. Other than that good welds and solid.
B001H3EONS|5|Very nice
B007QBSX5A|5|This starter is almost half the size of my old starter but just cranks hard and out performs the old starter systems.
B004GZSHSC|5|I bought this as a gift for my husband. We were both very impressed!
B00666GXDU|2|Do not fit Suzuki S50 - returning for a refund.
B00JL7Y8MY|5|Love these things. Going for an all black look on my Chevy. Install was moderatetly difficult and reccommend have some extra help and a lift.
B005H12SZ2|3|The mirrors work just fine. Took about 45 minutes to install and the fit and finish is quite good . They do vibrate slightly but nothing bad enough to be bothersome.<br />The only reason I'm giving these 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because of delivery issues. The first box I received only had one mirror in it, the passenger side. So I called amazon to verify that it was actually supposed to be both sides which they said yes it was. They sent me a return shipping label and shipped me a new order the following day. Luckily I hadn't shipped the single mirror back yet because the second box I received had two driver's side mirrors. So between the two orders I was able to get a pair of mirrors but it was quite the hassle. Shouldn't be that hard to put two mirrors in a box.
B002E5DT0C|5|Fits Perfect
B000OCBO1S|5|Bought this to replace standard pin for electric gate arm.  Came home one day to find someone from our electric company had pulled the pin on our gate opener so he could open our gate and drive down to look at the meter.  I might add we have a key pad for them but he forgot to get the code.  We solve this problem with this little JEWEL!  No more unauthorized entry without the code!!!!
B00280BL9O|5|Not much to say...works OK
B00S1X8I7U|5|I bought these pants and was amazed at the quality for the price. They are very comfortable, the fit well and they look very durable. I haven't worn them in the rain or cold yet, just summer riding. All the seams, zippers and Velcro closures are top notch. You will not find anything near this quality in this price range. I've seen less quality from name brands at twice the price. I also purchased their Men's TT jacket and it is also a great buy for $99. The only thing that comes close to the quality and features is at least twice the price. The jacket zips to the pants at rear of the waist. Both pants and jacket have removable quilted liners and armor in all the right spots. I also purchase a couple pairs of their gloves. The only caveat here is their sizing and jacket zippers. Their sizes are more Euro and run at least a full size small in the jackets. For the pants I wear 34&#34; inseam jeans and I bought the 36&#34; pants. I wish the pants were another inch longer, but they will work just fine. The zipper on the men's jacket has the slide on the right side like a woman's jacket. I don't know if this is a Euro thing also.<br />The most impressive thing for me with Sequoia Speed is their customer support.  The Speed Hero gloves were my first purchase and I wear larges. The Large gloves they sent would barely pull on my hand and I couldn't move it once it was on. I sent them an email and returned them and I got a pair of Xlarge which fit perfect but I noticed the seam on the thumb side of the index finger was separated at the large knuckle. I sent another email and complained about the problem plus the cost of returning two pair of gloves. They told me to keep that pair and they priority mailed me another pair. The gloves fit great and I believe they are going to last awhile. I ordered the TT Jacket after the gloves and going by their sizing chart I ordered a medium. I'm 6'3&#34; with a 44&#34; chest and 35&#34; arms. The large jacket was way tight and I couldn't fold my arms together in front of me. When I emailed them about this they told me to return it and they would ship me a Large and and XLarge and I could return the medium with the other jacket that I didn't keep. The XLarge was a perfect fit. They told me later they have revised their sizing chart since my purchase. I probably don't have much riding season left this year here in Alaska, but if I notice a problem with this gear, I will write another review. I bought the TT jacket direct from their website with free shipping.
B00H2WXWYA|5|THESE are BEAUTIFUL!!!!
B0040M31H8|5|Just what I wanted and the pic is what you get.
B0050HZ10M|5|It was hard finding a place to get it cut nobody wanted to take it but went to home depot and a nice lady did it for me and for free too! They want you to purchase a key from their store to cut it but they are very expensive and this one worked just like my original!
B007TY5I8E|5|As promised easily install 3 day shipping
B00EYGCBEO|5|The fox tail is so soft, perfect for any keychain or cosplay I highly recommend purchasing this item
B000A8JLIY|5|Installed in my 2008 Sonata 2.4 at 91,000 miles. Uneventful easy install and a noticeable difference in pep.
B00OA66IKQ|1|Ridiculous design of placing a plastic baggie inside the mitt between the microfiber outer shell and a polyester inner liner.<br />Imagine wrapping your hand in a starched linen handkerchief, covering it with a stiff plastic sack, and then putting that in a car wash mitt.<br />Uncomfortable to use and nearly impossible to clean and dry rapidly due to the middle plastic liner.
B00HJUKNMO|5|Love the versatility. And it holds my Rm 125 jusssssst right
B006LGKIRC|5|it is perfect
B00SVEQPRE|5|Great sticker
B004HWZFW0|5|Excelent product
B00873J0YY|5|Item was as described.  I did not find the instructions as hard as other members did.  It was only a matter of accounting for the parts and matching them to the illustration.  Additionally, I did not find putting on the rubber foot as hard as others did either.  I used a rubber mallet to tap it into place.  Easy peasy.  There are a lot of parts, so it does consume a bit of time, but nothing that can't be done while catching up on your favorite show.
B007V2UVR2|5|Lots of intake noise; which I like. Have not ordered the airbox cover because I like the noise. Added some performance as well. Would recommend this kit to any and everyone..
B001UHHMRG|5|good stuff
B008FBO8CM|4|Arrived as promised and was easy to apply.
B00FFDPPCA|5|Easy to install, good quality, perfect replacement.
B00FSDBFD0|5|fits great my 2006 tundra v8
B00O83NTUS|4|'Great addition to the look of the truck. Something to make it mine and make a statement. What they don't tell you is that you have to modify the inner fender support or use duct tape to make it fit. I started with the passenger side and immediately noticed that the blink rate was fast almost like there was a bulb out. Didn't think anymore about it until I put the driver's side in and the blink rate was normal. Sooooo I took the passenger side out again, switched the plugs and the blink rate is normal. I guess you get what you pay for...
B0009JB7GI|5|Works as indicated. Very helpful.
B004J9FAYE|4|Fit right in.No more check engine light after clearing codes.No wire harness like in picture.
B00KQ81M94|5|This is a great chamois. Smooth and my car reflects a mirror after a couple hours of work . Great product clear instructions. Happy to help with such a wonderful product
B006TMLEQW|5|This fit perfectly & looks exactly the same as the OEM on the other side.
B00P1SD7ZQ|4|Racks were great. Straps was not so good.
B001DCF6KI|5|easy to install. works great.  Thanks
B00TPKNREM|5|Worked perfectly
B003054ZFI|5|Perfect products. It is exceeding the OEM and original products.
B00ANZHG4U|4|These are a perfect size - we use them in the kitchen as dishcloths.  They wash and dry well and are quite absorbent and sturdy in the kitchen.  They are a great deal for the money - I would purchase again.
B00T74VX24|5|This thing saved the day.... I purchased this last week as a backup plan if my boat died while out on the water... well what do ya know,  took the boat out for the first time over the weekend, and ran the battery down.  Plugged this unit in and clamped it to the battery and the boat fired up... saved me from calling for help and being stranded in the middle of the lake for who knows how long.<br /><br />Boat has an inline 6 cylinder engine... just for those wondering what size engine it was helping to turn over.<br /><br />Really impressed with this little unit.  Great value for the price.<br /><br />Didn't realize it until I got it, but it has a USB port that can come in handy for phones or whatever.... Definitely recommend this to anyone.
B001CO69AS|5|guuud
B003UMRXSW|3|Product description is accurate. The device is mostly plastic(handle gently when preforming torque operations. You will need something to catch the L-arm on when using so the dial turns. The thumb screw and housing it screws into is plastic.(no strong arming or it will break) Works as expected.
B001N729FS|5|Great thing to have in you need to disconnect a battery terminal quickly or if your old terminal is starting to chip away.
B000XRHRZQ|5|worked out great
B00DJ5KL6Q|5|Went on easy enough. should work well
B001UED2TG|5|Met and exceeded our expectations and priced right
B000931OEO|4|One liquid is thicker than the other so when pouring keep this in mind and pour the thinner side more slowly than the thicker substance.  Once blended in the motor they seem to work in harmony very well.
B00RS0NI5Y|5|Convenient tools in the car for an extra holders and to prevent those small stuffs in going down between the seats .
B006VFEJJQ|5|Wow, this was just the thing I needed.  My original 2007 Prius accessory battery was finally having a hard time recharging after heavy electronics use during short trips in-town.  Since the Prius is used in a professional capacity with lots of electronic accessories such as UHF radio, dash cams, warning lights, I needed to find a battery that could charge quickly and support moderate cycling. The Optima 8171-767 has turned out to be a great replacement.  There is a built-in carrying handle on the top of the battery (not shown in most of the photos of the product) which is handy to have in the install phase, but gets in the way a bit when you're reconnecting the Prius connector harnesses and tie-down bar. However I was able to work around this additional space at the top without resorting to clipping the handle.  Otherwise, the install went easily and the 12v. connecting posts were an exact fit. No additional parts or modifications were needed.  I'm able to run accessories without worry now, using a Charge Guard to make sure the additional gizmos don't run for too long without the car in &#34;Ready&#34; mode, and haven't seen the dreaded Red Triangle Of Death once. So far so good!
B00B9F2QCA|5|Exactly what I needed!
B003SS62PS|5|Received this today and tested it out.  Works great.  I hope it has some durability, but time will tell.  It puts out good air flow for a small fan. Update:  We've been using this quite a bit on our month long trip and it is still working great.
B002E2WMVW|3|One of the bulbs went out the next day, lets give it the benefit of the doubt, because that side of the fog light is not that great it looked corroded but will see once I fix.
B000ICYC4U|5|Blue Magic is the best aluminum polish I have found. Tractor Trailer polishing wheels and tanks and steps, this is your answer!
B00G3BRNVY|5|The best oil money can buy. If you do a Google search for China Star Bullet Train Royal Purple see for yourself this is a high speed train we are talking about in the article. My personal experience with R.P. products has always been positive.  My 96 Explorer 6 cylinder  R.P. was used in the transmission and rear end with a very noticeable increase in smoothness. Changed from Mobile 1 engine oil to the R.P. high mileage 5w30 oil. For the best filtration money can buy there is only one brand to trust WIX'S oil filters,  The Explorer runs better than it ever has before. I noticed less use of the gas pedal for the same speed of highway driving.
B000NKCIXE|5|Ossum
B006VFR37G|5|Loved it
B0097MX0OK|5|Exelente
B000C58046|5|Very high quality.  Installation sheet wasn't very clear.  The round washers go on the inside of the oblong washers.
B007D6EABO|5|This works perfectly and protects your OEM mats. They are durable and last. I have been using these since I bought my car in May 2012. There is some discoloration in the driver may though wear my heel rests.
B00FYIBG6A|5|Exactly as depicted, ;erfect fit for my 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo XJ.
B00KWQTCX8|5|Easy install, worked perfectly
B000VKTUJQ|3|I bought the Fram product the last time and it is a better fit filter.
B000C0YR1G|5|Fit perfectly on my 01 Taurus with the Duratec engine. Only took 10 minutes to take the serpentine belt off, unbolt the nut, and install the new pulley.
B00723REN4|5|Worked great
B00NFPTTZE|5|Easy to apply but some of the letters were curved in on themselves to I had to unstick them then smooth them down
B0077S1BBU|5|Fit perfect. Thank you!
B008G4Y076|3|they have been working on and off on my Silverado back up lights , changed then over from one side to another and changed the direction  of the sockets , and they work then don't then work again ,
B0009H519Y|3|Ok
B00JYWDHGY|4|I bought this for my husband he drives a 1976 datsun 280z and was so excited when I found this for him. I wish it was metal instead of the hard plastic but ibis well made and sturdy for plastic, more importantly my husband loved it!!!
B0050EIREW|5|Thank you just want I needed
B009DJS5VU|4|Color was a little off but it looks pretty great for the price. Much better than the chrome look I had.
B001S3ACTM|5|Great item
B000EAIERW|5|great!
B00LP44SO4|5|Fit, quality better than expected.
B00092893E|5|I have a 2009 Honda Civic. I bought it in 2012 with 48k miles and now I'm at 73k. It's a pretty good car and I have no complaints, but... it's nothing special. I hoped the Techron would boost gas mileage.<br /><br />I waited until I had about 10% left in my gas tank and filled up to begin a 60-mile trip. About halfway through the results were obvious -- my car had zip and was responding faster, and smoother, to acceleration.<br /><br />By the time I was halfway home on the return trip, I was able to accelerate more quickly and my girlfriend agreed that the ride was much smoother. I didn't realize I had inefficient fuel injection until giving this a shot (I only bought it because it was on sale!), but seriously, it works. Even if the gas mileage difference isn't massive, I'd pay $8 a bottle just to have the zip back in my car and have a smoother ride.
B00ATE00KW|4|Good quality--good be a little bigger.
B00AAYYE26|5|Perfect system for those people that are planning to upgrade other exhaust parts such as header, frontpipe/overpipe, the q300 i think is one of the quietest aftermarket exhaust out there, just the q300 alone with everything stock sounds like almost stock, i would say 10% louder than the stock, though this exhaust gives you that low deep note when you press the gas and gives you stock sound when your on idle, also no drones, perfect for daily driving. Now everything changes when you upgraded other parts of the system, for me the q300 alone is too quite so i decided to change my front pipe to a catless one, oh boy!!! the q300 becomes more alive, i love that deep tone on wot, the loudness is so balance and perfect. So far thats the only upgrade i made on my frs, and im loving it. Also the burn tips looks good on my asphalt frs.
B002QOYS42|3|Have to remove liner for almost any water bottle to fit. Does not stay upright. Tilts when riding so you have to be careful. The bottle never fell out though. Serves it purpose. Just have to keep adjusting it as we ride.
B000BYGD7E|4|So far so good...  just been on for about 500 miles
B0024E6QX0|5|This is a must have for the RVer.  I have mine installed in bedroom. It block the light at night and heat in daytime.
B000X20KNW|5|Love it, I am constantly putting a wheel chair in and out of the cargo area of my SUV.  Having this makes It easier to slide it in and out saving time and my carpeting.
B004I0FBCA|5|good
B004YA2726|5|I feel so much more confident in circles of friends that have more money now that my 13 year old Toyota Camry has these chrome valve caps sporting the Toyota logo on them. I often wear the included baller wrench on a neck chain just waiting for chicks to ask &#34;what's that&#34; then I can be like oh it's just a custom wrench for putting air in my tires, wanna see? Once they see my Golden Yota they are mine.
B00523AV54|4|It was jusr what we used before
B00MW8G2IW|5|Perfect, buyer beware, the battery does not need to be replaced. It synced or programmed right out of the box. My husband tried to install a battery and found it was already included. Perfect!
B00316K61S|5|exactly what I needede
B00FZK5CYE|5|Love all the quotes. Good quality.
B0002UEOM8|5|Great product  have used it for many years
B00BL00NXM|5|Works as intended. Put it on my 1999 Legacy GT, and it also fits a manual 2012 Subaru Legacy
B00B4S2II4|5|they look good 2008 tacoma double cab pre runner
B000C7S062|3|This is the second one my Cherokee has gone through, but there are not consistently good aftermarket options available elsewhere. The OEM one lasted 168,000 miles, and the first spectra went from 168k to 227k. It wasn't leaking...yet, but the bottom bar was completely rotted out and I was taking it out for another reason and decided to put a new one in. If you're not in a northern state and have good fluid in your Jeep, it should last longer.<br /><br />Also, I have an external transmission cooler to eliminate the possibility of anti-freeze getting into the trans (and slightly better cooling), so I cannot comment on that.<br /><br />Vehicle: 2000 Jeep Cherokee 4.0
B000PUFFF0|5|Easy installation and looks great.
B000C9MZJS|5|The correct plug for my application, hard to find localy.
B00GR2WCTW|5|Stick well even in high temps. Have them on valve cover for 3 months now and no peeling!
B003AG4UW0|5|Very nice quality decal.
B00M78820I|5|Blocks the sun well and folds up easily.
B00WCB96XC|5|Quick delivery great product to show my history and support
B003TPQYPI|5|I have two of these. One for the wash bucket and one for the rinse bucket.  they fit perfectly in the Home Depot orange bucket.  they do what they are suppose to do.  I wouldn't wash my car without them.
B00LUUMVBK|5|Almost 1 week and still work fine
B000C7TTX0|5|Great product. Great price.  Easy do it yourself project.  Fill it with 50/50 to eliminate mixing estimates.
B009XUM0N8|5|must have if u have subs!
B0000AY3DS|4|'mirror' part not exactly high grade 'lens' material, but for a budget purpose does the job...  seems to screw into place securely and is the right size and seems solid enough. WE always have more than one person in the boat if we're towing someone, so this was more to be legal in case we ever wanted to have just driver and person being towed...  and for the driver to be able to peak on their own without relying on the other passenger.  SO, this fits our needs well enough in spite of the lack of crisp visual.  It's ok to good, not good to great.
B00LZGWJ1Q|5|Perfect fit and timely delivery
B00DL6T2YK|5|I love this thing, and the glow in the dark face is really nice at night. So glad I did my research and chose this over a digital gauge. We use this to check the tire pressure on my Honda Fit and on his Hd Road King Classic.
B0045WBVUM|5|works great if I had to give any advice to someone about the air pressure less is best
B003172CBO|5|I love my trailtech on my SV650, there is so much information online on how to install it properly on your bike and it's awesome!  It's easy to read tach and speed, plus you know that your speed is more accurate also.  I got this because my OEM gauges got smashed in a crash, perfect excuse for an upgrade.  Only thing I wish this had would be a dimmer switch of some sort, this thing is Bright at night.  Otherwise, Great Product.  I would definitely buy this again for a future bike.
B00FH8P1DG|5|Awesome product very bright
B00H47K3C2|4|Rotors work as they should, not issues with them. However, shipping to A LONG time.
B00QW8KLEY|5|Super bright
B006X98A7C|5|Got it quickly & works as advertised so far. This is a replacement for an APC UPS battery. I'm happy to keep some e-waste out of the landfill & re-use the UPS by just adding a new battery. I'll be placing an order for another APC UPS soon!
B0006ODWFU|5|Throttle response is a little better and im seeing 1-3 mpg increase between city and highway driving
B00KMM6A6Y|3|They are really cool and I love how they switch from white to amber, then back to white slowly. But the amber is not as bright as I would like it to be. If you want your turn signal to be brighter and be seen - stick with the halogen bulb you already have. The white running light setting is fairly bright though
B000C9TU3M|5|factory oem replacement part.
B00GSE5OU8|5|Everything fit well good seller
B001V8NKW0|5|Holds the ramp up & out of the way
B00AW1SJEG|5|Product as expected
B0019IADHW|2|Springs are about 25% shorter than the worn OEM pair that I removed. Ended up not using these because of that.
B00JHK81X2|4|Great kit with just about everything you will ever need if stranded for a short period of time.
B001S1IN72|3|Ok
B011CVIQ42|5|Nice decal.
B003XWXW7K|4|just a little to tight
B003PB4AY8|5|Great. Did the job!
B002P2YGLU|4|My 13-year old bracket that held the wand had broken and I needed a replacement.  That bracket is just a bit less cost than a whole unit.  So, I bought the whole replacement unit and  installed.  I would have given the ratings of 5-stars, but the bracket (though stronger) did not match the original holes.  Not wanting more holes in the shower wall, I carefully elongated one hole of the new bracket with a drill bit.  Worked well, but sure would have been nice to have holes match both old AND new models.
B004HE563G|5|Great so far, perfect fit.
B00FXYDGCM|5|Looks nice,  easy to work with
B00NMWE7K2|2|Didn't show any difference in my car.
B00YMUC6RE|5|Do the work
B000F0QRTS|4|For the price.....cannot be beat!
B00YOFGLRS|1|I didn't like this product cause when i ordered it i was hoping to get what i was seeing but instead i got a whole different product that i didn't need so for i was highly piss about this product
B002SB04CS|4|great way to keep you back space clean
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Great! Kept my car cool and completely covered the windshield of my Subaru.
B00D1S0JKO|5|Great product.  Fits well
B004IVGA0G|4|Good quality.  The flag pole tube is a large diameter.  I've had to sleeve every pole I've used in it, to make it fit.
B000GRQIZI|5|Significant improvement for my ZRX 1200----should have done it years ago.
B00THH6C0O|5|Arrived quickly! Great product! Thank you!!
B001O67B9W|5|Very impressed with the quality, fit and finish of these bags.  They make the factory &#34;hard bags&#34; more functional by containing your loose odd's'n'ends inside the paniers.  Recommended!
B000FPXV5G|2|Would not buy,not what I expected. Can not use the parking brake and cup holder two small.
B00062YACG|5|very good
B000N2DHQ4|3|It is the perfect height for me, but one has to position oneself with the points inbetween the leg's and for me that is not comfortable.  Unfortunately I cannot return it,wasted money:-(
B00B3CBMH4|5|This light is super bright for what it is works great on a Yamaha grizzly 700 it's not really spot kind of a floody spot . High quality parts . I would buy this again . Far as long term holding up I have no idea . Does not leak water in .
B00BC1G2M6|1|It was my mistake to buy just drive shaft. Need to buy the whole Kit with is go for $ 96.00, that is the best way to fixed
B002EW5FWU|5|I only used a damp towel. My bug stains has been there after 5 car washes. So I jumped the boat for this bug spray even it was a little pricey. It melted the bug stains and removed it within seconds using only this and a damp towel like it was never there.
B009WX88NM|5|I bought these for my Jeep Grand Cherokee. They are a little bit oversized, but that's no big deal. And mine DID com with elastic straps and hooks to secure it. Overall this is a very good quality cover. Very comfy. I mostly bought it to use in the summer when my leather seats heat up enough to burn my gal's legs when she's in shorts. I don't want her to stop wearing shorts, so these fit the bill perfectly. I haven't tried them yet in cold weather, but I can beat they keep the bum warm. Don't know how it will react to the seat warmers yet, but we'll see. I can always take them off for a season until shorts-weather comes back.
B003LNJWTI|4|guuud
B00B51XWTO|5|It was perfect.  Color matched great.  Installed easily.
B00QQ40PIG|5|exelente
B00BQS6YNW|5|excelent materials, worked in mt mercedes 230e very well. As it was said it was at home at the fourth day and I live in Chile.
B005C577Z4|4|fit to my 2013 yamaha vstar custom..the shipping little longer than i respected
B00LG07MZE|5|Very pleased with product.
B00HSCNM4O|4|This stuff is seriously sticky, wear gloves if handing and try not to touch areas of the project with the gloves
B002DPHDF0|2|In discription it should have a left or right or passenger side or drivers side placement
B001C8YQC2|4|These seem great. I just got installed them last month. It was easy to do. The only reason I didn't put up 5 stars is because I haven't used them very long.
B000CNN27S|5|Great Sound, I love it.
B00GYI1ICQ|5|Great product exact fit for my 2016 rancher came with great instructions on not only how to install the winch mount  but how to do a complete  winch install actually the instructions were better then the instructions that came with the winch I bought
B000N9LN22|5|no problem yet
B00EA0ZB7I|3|EDIT ..... They look badass on the truck to bad they won't last :/ .... Overall the lights look pretty cool however they are not sealed properly the weather striping rubber around the lights are all out of place .... Lights look nice worth the 20 bucks but if I where to buy them again I would spend a little more and get better quality &#34; look closely at the pictures and you will notice around the light how the sealing rubber is squeezed out... Out of place
B0002JMUZW|5|Exact replacement for less money.
B00KTHU356|5|It worked great
B00FG5GRZ6|5|Quality Product. Fast shipping!
B001OKD8VI|5|Just a normal gasket, but cheap and worked great, easy to put on. Stopped the leak.
B00IKALC0E|5|worked perfectly for us. some dealers are not using this tool and have damaged engine blocks.
B003YI421I|5|works great
B00KNB87LK|1|PIECE OF JUNK  DO NOT BUY
B0049MZBK4|5|Very easy to install, fits perfectly on my Frontier, works well for towing. Poor packaging. The box was completely broken and in pieces.
B00PUOESC2|4|Good quality good fit seat covers
B00CGGXQV6|5|Cover looks to be good quality.  Cannot yet verify mileage improvement claims.
B00AM3GM7A|5|perfect fit great looking part
B00HFX38U4|5|This is a good tool, easy to read and well-built. I bought it to check pressure on my Sportster and the 90-degree chuck makes it so easy to use. The only improvement I can think of - though it doesn't really *need* it - would be to change the hard connection at the chuck end of the hose to a swivel (the hose swivels but only at the gauge end).<br /><br />As to the accuracy I'm confident it's within a pound. I checked at a random gas station and the difference was less than a pound on both tires. For the price that's perfectly acceptable. For cars/trucks maybe you don't need the right-angle chuck; for bikes it's perfect.
B00844QQKW|3|Harder than I would have liked them. Look great just not squishy like the stock pads.
B00W68ITPM|1|The harness fit very sloppy I ended up buying the Motorcraft harness and glow plugs and only used the gaskets. The clips for the injectors would just fall right off and this will cause major engine damage. The guy I got the harness from told me to only use Motorcraft glow plugs because hes seen aftermarket ones break off inside the heads.<br />Save your money and buy Motorcraft the first time.
B0124DKVXG|3|Quality is just ok. Magnets do stick to car. Even left it by mistake while driving through the carwash and they were still there afterwards. Biggest issue was one magnet had bubbles under the logo. It does appear one of the corner of the logo is separating from the magnet.
B009IFIKAU|5|fast and easy install
B006K8V5M8|5|Good quality, so far seem great for (salt) marine use.
B001DKQZ9Q|1|Broke immediately after pumping a few times. Junk.
B0031I9RDY|5|Great price. Works great.
B0065263IU|2|My husband loves this for ease of use. But it is like sitting on a cinder block. It is SO uncomfortable! I won't ride on it anymore.
B000EQ0082|5|Muy buenos
B00IO0IXOS|5|Looks great
B001554V7C|5|worked great
B000ETQMIQ|3|This purchase was priced right but it will not retain its shape. The sides  tend to cave in or flop over so every time you wish to toss something in it you must first straighten it up. It does however stay put when you place it.
B008G3AD0A|2|Starting to flake on outside after 5 months..
B002E5DT0C|4|Works fine, but is a bit loud.
B0068TXJ3C|1|The adhesive on the clear front that the sticker is attached too is way too sticky and the sticker adhesive is very weak.  When you peel the sticker off and attach it to a surface, the front clear part won't let the sticker adhere to the window and it stretched the sticker.  After some damage to the sticker, I got it to actually stick to the surface but it stretched and ripped.
B00KTJ4RUG|5|Works just as good as my original!
B001GJ3FIS|2|Cheap.  Had one stream of water that was shooting at a weird direction right out of the box.  It started leaking terribly after only two weeks of light use.
B002M47A1Y|5|Fit right in,  Had both left and right changed in 10 minutes.
B00480GYSA|5|I bought these as replacements for my fog lights and they are brighter than the one's replaced.  Received on time and in good condition.
B004I6RQFO|5|Worked exactly as expected
B00AIJY2ZM|5|As close to pure white as I can detect with the naked eye. They claim 6000k which seems reasonable to me.<br />As far as brightness I put them somewhere between a 168 and a 194.<br /><br />Unfortunately the color temperature is too cool to match the warmer (yellowish) headlight bulbs, so I will not use them on my front marker lights. Also the light pattern is not a full sphere, so they are more directional than a typical incandescent lamp even inside the marker light lens I tried them in.<br /><br />In theory, due to the low power of these lamps they could be installed anywhere a 161, 168, or 194 &#34;Wedge Base&#34; lamp was meant to go. Here's why I think that:<br />For reference here are the Sylvania power ratings for the three types of &#34;normal&#34; wedge base bulbs plus this LED bulb:<br />194: 3.78 Watts<br />168: 4.90 Watts<br />161: 2.66 Watts (my calculation)<br />This LED: 1 Watt<br /><br />So you can see that at least from a heat standpoint the LED could safely go wherever the same shape wedge lamp was specified. Since my car uses a 168 or 194 in 7 different locations, I am sure I will find a suitable place to put these.<br /><br />Don't forget they are polarized (unlike an incandescent). A gambling man would say you will get it right on your first try 50% of the time. If not, flip it around (they have a puny red dot on the positive side).<br /><br />Hope it helps.
B00HIZQIBK|5|GOOD
B000NKB2PO|5|2003 BMW 325i<br /><br />Installation: Very simple, make sure you have some sockets for European cars for an easier install. Lots of videos on Youtube on how to install these filters.<br /><br />Also, recommend buying some mass air flow sensor cleaner and using it during the install.<br /><br />Performance: The air intake gives off a very nice sound when accelerating. There is a whining sound at lower speeds, but after around 30mph it is not noticeable. I have not been able to determine if I am getting better MPG.<br /><br />About 2 weeks after I installed this product, I received a service engine soon warning and found a P0174 code. I did some research online and found out that most people solved this problem by buying the MAF sensor cleaner and cleaning up the mass air flow sensor. I did the same, and the code is now gone. I doubt that the code was a result of this product, but still recommend the cleaner as you will be removing it during installation anyways.
B003VOGB2S|4|Fast delivery. OEM quality. Good price.
B0066QT33C|5|I love paying a fraction of the OEM parts and getting something that fits right and works right.
B00BT1GQCA|5|Appears identical to the OEM version it replaced, and it worked perfectly for a fraction of the price.
B00DGMA9K0|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B008032NP4|5|It worked in a 1995 Civic EX 4 door
B0038P9ML2|5|no more falling on my face in the muddy and wet stuff  pick a line and go.and they wear great to better then my metzlers or pirrelis.which cupped and traction stunk.
B00GQO5C9S|5|Use them on my semi, they are solid and get the job done. I would buy these again and would recommend them to anyone doing work on the tractor in the driveway.
B00PMC3BKW|2|revenue water within the bar and now led only flashes
B00ULNYA02|1|Junk one word says it all
B007VR64M8|5|Good

B00NN85SH6|4|Good product
B00T6T1FBE|4|Had make them fit look gud...
B002UBZMCS|4|Working great after a month, gas pilot a little noisier and perhaps using more propane for pilot, but burns clean and quieter than the old one.
B001810SHA|4|thank you
B00EO3HCH8|5|These gloves grip just right on my bike! And breathe pretty well too. Keeps hands cool
B00JL8099Y|5|Item fit perfectly, great looking and well made. Easy  installation
B00MXBTMKS|5|I love it! Especially because it's made to fit a woman.
B009FNX780|5|easy install great fit
B005QION72|5|Overall a good helmet. Cons bad location for strapping button, little noisy. Pros- affordable modular helmet, neat sun visor and snug fit. A good buy for me.
B0041FXOIA|5|Works GREAT on my 2014 Dodge RAM 2500 4x4. Only available for the driver side. Very easy 15 minute install. If you can basically turn a wrench you can install this.
B00K36QPCS|5|Perfect
B002Q1F8L2|1|IT DO NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO PUT THEM ON
B002M4C6AO|4|Give a 4. Because it does have a gap on both. one has way more of a gap then the other . but overall easy to install and they are beautiful . thankx
B00BTSFOLC|4|Works well. Easy to sync with Car
B00UYD2IG2|5|Definitely genuine and helpful.  I wish the trucks would just come with these liners in them from the factory-I am sure everyone wants them!
B00VBZSFR8|5|Good
B00B1UI4MY|5|Its been about a year and it still looks perfect on my Jeep.
B00ANWV5ZE|5|Very good!
B00AJ3WBE6|5|Good product and good price
B00Y3H40KC|5|Great really big but great
B00BITID38|1|I havent even received the part yet and I'm already annoyed, there is a tool to help you find if the part is compatible and before ordering this I used to tool to see if it was the right part, and it said it would work, I checked the part page this morning for tracking details and it showed that this part wasn't compatible with my model car, so I redid it to see if maybe I accidentally changed it but nope, still not compatible.
B0006IX850|5|Makes filling the water tank on the trailer easy.  There is no danger of busting the tank as you would with a pressure supply.
B007T4JTHU|3|As advertised
B000YLWM56|3|Bought this for use in our driveway under an older car. Works to absorb the oil, but needs to be weighted down. Otherwise it would blow away on our Florida afternoon storms.
B00XG851UC|5|Great shipping! It fits perfectly.
B00DWKY0VU|5|Works well
B0028JQZ5U|4|I'm 275 lbs and just finished using this thing for 4 days worth of wrenching. It works great and rolls smooth. I had no problems with it supporting me. The one thing I didn't like, is because I'm fat, the casters will rub on me sometimes...but that's really more my problem than it is a problem of the creeper.  I think this is great for the price and would recommend. It would probably work better for someone who doesn't have 54&#34; shoulders :).
B00EP3PUV2|5|Perfect and super easy installation
B000PGEMQM|5|great product for bathroom bowls
B00U83AZIQ|2|Only lasted 2 months!
B00E1SMYYW|4|The fit well and working fine
B001GH5PWY|5|Installed 2 on the dash of my RZR 1000. Pulled the dash off and cut out the knock out plugs for extra switches. Perfect fit and they look just like OEM. Couldn't be happier.
B0016KH18M|1|Do not buy this hitch! I used it to carry two bicycles and the bike carrier itself. However after a three months it bent the spare tire pan on my car. Not badly but I feel that it's of poor design. I would be worried to pull a trailer with it like it says you can. Now I cannot return it for another better deigned hitch.
B00HSHW3BM|5|Bright lights pretty much plug and play but does not include dome lights overall great product
B00DMOSGH0|1|their junk made it 10 miles before seam came apart and went flat
B008PTN992|3|Appears to work as discribed, however, using theUSB and supplied CD I was unable to download updates? The code in the car was not listed in the index? but its a 2000 HYUNDAI so . . .
B000E35UV2|1|do not fit to small .the reason I'm trying to return everything I order is because my mechanic was ill & couldn't work on my car so that's why I'm trying to return everything. sorry for the delay on everything for my truck.Thanks still in the box
B0049U31I0|5|Perfect fit.
B0002YR8H2|5|Charger worked fast on lawnmower battery---very satisfied with its performance.
B0009H519Y|5|Used this to clean a industrial polished aluminum garage heater, worked great. Wipe on, wipe off and it is very shinny now, went over after to remove any streaks with a microfiber cloth with some vinegar on it, that finished the job perfectly. A little also goes quite a long way.
B00KWEVZTE|5|Original Part fits my Mazda 3, and I don't have to pay $50 to have it installed!
B005HF3BWW|5|Small, compact and does the job for my iPass, good product.
B0039HD4RM|5|Looks great! Easy to install
B00EVEDB8Y|4|I love this thing so far!<br /><br />It is QUIET! But as someone else mentioned I can tell it is getting louder and louder. But still it is pretty quiet!<br /><br />Someone else mentioned that it is tight. I would agree, but I think that is a good thing. You don't want your helmet flying off! I bought a large, and compared to my other helmet (some no name helmet I bought a long time ago) it fits a little tighter, but enough room to wear a bluetooth accessory or headphones.<br /><br />I really like the drop down sun shade. Here are the things I don't like about this helmet<br /><br />1. As you can see in the image, there are stickers all over everywhere. They keep referring to a manual, but it didn't include a manual. Maybe there is a website? I missed it if there is.<br /><br />2. They don't give a rating for the sun shade. I ASSUME it blocks UV radiation, but I am not SURE, I will buy a separate lens filter to put on top of it if I can.
B00CO05K1I|2|The seat covers fit well and looks fine.  However after couple months of use, it started to come apart at the seam where the driver enter the vehicle.  I am an average size person.  I had seat covers on other Toyotas for years without this problem.  It might be poor workmanship that cause the separation. The material seem would last for a long time.
B00EXIEVO6|1|I was looking forward to receiving this item, when it arrived I noticed that it's very small. I tried it on my car battery and found that the clips were too small for the post. I was further disappointed that the charged battery didn't register. I purchased three as gifts one for myself but I may have just wasted my money
B000VL6AHU|5|Perfect fit, no issues.
B00317A1MQ|5|Shorter usable gears! If you want to stay in the power band and love shifting your sled like a motocross bike this is it!
B000YCAMAM|5|Fits perfect!!!
B00A4542H8|4|This is more of a comment than a review.  This wax requires a microfiber cloth for removal and polishing.  I have previously used other Turtle products and Meguiar's Gold, and these waxes can be polished with a terrycloth towel.  Not so with Turtle Ice.  I removed much of the excess wax with a towel, but I could only remove the remaining wax and polish the finish with a microfiber cloth.  Several previous commenters have noted difficulty in polishing, and I expect that they weren't using a microfiber cloth.
B000V5NOY8|5|The quality the bell was just what I expected from a Gates product, very good. The description however could've been better.
B00LBWA3VW|5|does its job and looks clean, definitely an upgrade
B008MPQM2K|4|I would have licked it if the back matt's covered all of the back. But over all, it's a great product.
B00EZJBELQ|5|Does the job
B005LXHZ1I|4|Good quality, good price
B00OQPRPK8|4|I ordered two of these for my kids for a road trip we had.  At first we were skeptical due to the fact that there is no strap at the bottom to hold it down.  We were surprised and pleased.  One was not needed.  It held all of the things that my kids wanted and it even served as a place to keep things while away from the car.  Now that we are back home, my kids asked to keep them in the car for daily use.
B004A32AD8|5|Great part
B001CA8W6Q|5|Fit on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 4.7 4x4 perfectly. A little trimming kept me from having to unhook lines to condenser. Works great, stronger fan than oem.
B002YI74U0|5|So far so good.... time will tell.  Very easy use.
B00KLKW3S6|5|Only issue was with throttle cable mount, screw hole isn't threaded.The blank hole is there if you want to tap it, but it is a free mount system.  Just remove mount from throttle cable and install through neck . Works great, and had very quick and accurate responses to any questions that I had. Recommended seller..
B000C9WJ8K|5|good for the money
B00KTIYXLU|4|The case would come apart occasionally.  I would pull my keys out of my pocket the two halves of the case would become disconnected sand fall onto the ground.
B00BSENYRI|4|Fit just like the original
B000Q0YQIQ|5|Very good
B00L6FWK0G|5|Very reasonable, works great for 1/25 the cost of a genuine Porsche product
B006K6P68O|4|Causes a little trouble with the hatch closing but my hatch is very sensitive about anything touching the hatch.
B007J7E4K4|5|Excellent!!
B000CO86EG|4|Worked great! Reason for only four stars is that the handle is two pieces that slide together with no lock and comes apart as you are using it. It also slides through the hole which makes it tough to use in a tight spot.
B00T4TEWBQ|4|Love it. Handy dandy.
B00L88TNN8|3|Nice peice but is seems smaller than the pick.
B00BI7YHQ2|5|Good shipping, good product. I removed original crush-box, and added a drift-bar for extra strength before install, and the grill is more open.
B00F8TLBM4|5|Delivered early !!!<br />Love it!!
B000XY00IA|4|This was an easy swap, no adjustments necessary to fit my 2008 Vulcan 900.  It greatly improves the passenger seat which was the idea.  I was hoping it would be friendlier on my tailbone as well, but it's about the same as the stock seat in that regard.  I think it is a bit narrower and lower than stock which is good.
B001VLK0RA|5|Works great.  Also bought pump for a friend.
B00CEXKBN2|1|followed instructions for installation, in less than a month, it came off and broke.
B003QACOWS|3|Finish of this product is about C-.  Rough surface and glue residue can be seen... Good fit but I am not happy with it.
B00B2Q1C9E|5|Good product
B0007LTXVE|5|goodjob
B005CW9OXU|5|works well
B00M5CLDP2|5|bolted right up. Seems to steer a bit easier than the stock piece. Best part is that it was a quarter of the price for the Kawasaki part!
B000CIT3NU|5|Some of the best filters on the market, and they are a bit better priced, even with shipping on here versus in store. This size fits where the typical PH16 (Fram designation) goes on many Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeeps, but has more capacity. I use this on my 1992 2.2l turbo lebaron and 2000 4.0l Jeep Cherokee.
B0074BMB0U|5|works.  the plastic card supplied breaks apart, like a dry cracker, so do not be surprised.  I substituted it with an old credit card and it works fine.  The best part is the cloth.
B000CO7NGI|5|Used in Cibie e-code housings. Time will tell how long they last, but output is consistent side to side and they seem well made.
B007SOODHC|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Love these towels. I was able to do an entire pickup truck with a few towels.
B003ZVPMFY|1|Not OEM, china rip-off
B003M73GAE|5|A well-balanced boot jack that is effective and won't make you feel likely to slip while removing your boots.  Because of the construction materials, you can feel confident leaving this boot jack on your covered porch.
B00RE6KV48|5|This is truly a great product, and I'm ordering more today, I used it on my husbands leather recliner, it was drying and cracking, also I got paint on it, I was actually hoping to get it reupholstered, he didn't want me to, so I tried leather rescue instead. So happy I did, the chair looks and feels wonderful. We're going to use it on the leather seats in the car.
B006E595YC|5|good quality product, works on a kayak in wet environment
B006WPQNB2|1|BEWARE!!!,,,,Pump replacement cost $130.00.
B00VVFO39W|5|Works perfectly!  I needed the exterior enclosure.
B00MGTS1WW|5|This is a big case. Perfect for all the stuff to take on vacation
B004ME11FS|5|I use this to refill my aging barrel with water for my fish tank. It works great, great rigidity and doesn't crimp like other cheaper hoses. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00SIKVBBQ|4|This worked exactly as I had hoped. The cable is very long making it easy to route from the front of my bike back to the battery. There were ring connectors on the ends of the wire so it was really easy to connect to the battery terminals. My only complaint is that the size of the USB portion is much larger that I was envisioning. I had to get real creative to find a spot that was out of the way and still accessible for plugging/unplugging cables on my '14 V-Strom 1000.
B000C9NJR0|5|Part was as described shipping was fast
B000EDSSDO|2|Misleading size.
B009OQ6PT6|5|Cute plate and looks exactly as the picture presents it. Very satisfied with the purchase and price
B00EPG08SE|5|Great product
B000CAVDS6|1|Wrong size
B00P2QQEH0|4|Easy install except the inside retention bars didn't fit so they needed to be drilled.
B007L2JNJ4|5|Perfect fit.  Looks like the mirrors actually belong on the truck.
B000BRF3WM|5|easy to use and worked as described
B009AA9XHC|5|Great product!
B00355QYDY|5|Exactly what I needed at a great price and shipping was very quick
B00DD4HRFQ|5|Good product and very fast delivery.
B00496IQAM|5|Fit perfect
B0087NB4H0|5|Shipped fast, Works well.
B00VGL6TWA|3|Pricing was nice but had to make the hole in the tow bar a little large so that it would work in my receiver hitch. The hole was slightly off center.
B00MV7E3XA|5|Ecxelent
B00J5BUZIM|5|This thing is amazing and the quality is top notch. I was looking for a safe way to wash my 911 and this is perfect.
B00COOB298|5|This fixed my starting problem. My 1997 Dodge B2500 cargo van was beginning to start intermittently. Sometimes it would just make a clicking noise and sometimes it would start, but it acted like the battery was weak and would turn over slowly. The plunger ring in the solenoid was really pitted and the contacts were burned down to half of the original thickness. I noticed that I needed metric tools to get into the solenoid. It was a relatively quick repair all in all.
B001050JMS|5|It was just fine - I bought it for a friend who wanted a new firth wheel.  She was surprised!
B00DJ5KEF4|5|As expected nice product.
B00EKTIT0U|5|Makes car look really  sharp
B00BTGSID0|5|These are so useful. They arrived on time and as expected. Great for wiping away streaks from glass top stoves and stainless steel appliances.
B00BNR5Y46|5|worked great
B0002MBKAA|5|A+ Thank you!
B00I5HRFYY|5|Works great no problems
B001C6Q7US|3|After only a week I can hear it struggling. I'm not sure if it's a weak actuator or there's something REALLY wrong with my vent doors.<br />The only difference between this and the factory actuator is additional gear teeth in the cylinder.
B00NAJ6HYQ|5|Awesome product.
B00H29LPCE|5|great srevice
B005P7CL6O|4|GOOD
B004IYCNIQ|5|Just what I needed. Replacement was very easy.
B003U30IGA|5|nice and quick
B000PAM9KO|5|good price and prime delivery
B004GFS2C8|2|I had a small crack which after consulting online looked like a star crack which was less than 1-inch in length in all directions on my windshield. It had been more than 6 months before I finally decided that I should fix it as it looked like it may have gotten slightly bigger. After I got this kit and  read the manual,  it showed some examples of what cracks it would work for. It didn't show an example of a star crack, but it also didn't say that it wouldn't work for it. So I tried it by following the instructions carefully. It filled the small dent (entry point), BUT IT DID NOT FILL THE CRACK ITSELF.  Now I'm not sure if I can even get it fixed from my local windshield repair shop as the entry point is filled with the resin from this kit! THE SELLER and the Blue-Star Website SHOULD post clearly what type of cracks this kit can repair!!!!
B00JU3QPIO|2|smaller than actual Ford emblems used on Mustang.
B000CSGX9C|5|Working fine received it pretty quickly.
B00UMO9O1K|5|worked great
B005TTZ78M|5|Just awesome! !!  I recommend them tell anyone.
B00967HUQ0|5|I have used it several times to retrieve nuts and bolts it works very well. Magnet is stronger than i thought it would be.
B000MIT5VA|1|Bolt holes don't line up (requires drilling) on my 2004 TJ.  No big deal.<br /><br />  But the left largest speaker makes a bad noise.  Can the seller contact me so we can fix this?  Or do I need to send the entire thing back (a real pain)?  Otherwise I'm happy with it, I'll update if the seller gets back with me.
B0001WW37U|4|Good product for light-duty use
B00AQKC7LO|5|I have solar panels and 12v batteries out in a storage trailer in the woods.  I bought two of these lights and man do they light up the interior of that trailer.  When I first put them in,  I had to remind myself they were there and I did not have to look for stuff blinded anymore... hit the button and daylight! They do blind you if you don't aim them right... and I love the fact they swivel.  Exactly what I needed and will be buying more.  I have a led 12 volt tv with antenna on the roof limited local reception.  Even with these lights hooked to separate battery I loose reception on some channels...still love these lights though!  Update.  Rerouted the antenna cable away from led light and I now have no reception problems.  Having good lighting in a trailer/van/camper etc. is a must have!  New led TV, led lights, and an endless breeze fan...as well as internet service...has certainly transformed my off grid experience over back when I had my 1987 conversion van years ago.  Also, advances in solar panels/chargers have made life a lot better...actually down right comfortable.  The lights are bright!
B002M2KO4G|4|Seems to be working fine so far.
B000PEZ196|5|Works Great!
B00COTJYSE|3|Nice cover for the price- however had a pretty good day of rain and next day went to load the truck and the bed was full of water:/ made sure everything was sealed correctly do idk how that much water made it in!
B00G4UW6HU|4|Works as advertised and no problems yet.
B008RIEQXY|4|Could come with better nuts/locknuts, but otherwise a really great product.
B003330HGS|5|I was worried about the quality and fit at fist but once I got it and put it on I was very impressed I like it a lot and only took like 20-25 mins to put on. I recommend you guys but this product
B001LXMHL0|3|quite small
B001OCXI2U|5|Worked well.  Not a lot of space to work with on between the tool box and the bed of the truck but the product works well.
B006N92WCQ|5|Had the death wobble with stock track bar. Not only did this take care of it, it fit perfectly. Now if you put this on and the ball joint end does not line up with the hole. Don't run to your computer or your Amazon app and punch out a bad review. If it does not line up, try shaking your vehicle to the left and right tell the hole lines up. If that makes sense. If not, Youtube it. This product was easy to install and worked just fine for me. 5 out of 5. Spagett
B00ABRFG1U|5|Now that my globe box is organized ... it's easy to find whatever I need.
B00W65O3P0|5|I live it. supper fast shipping
B000CINCXC|5|Put on my 2000 Jeep Cherokee 4.0 with a slight lift. Mounted in front. Not too much of difference in ride on normal roads, but are very solidly built/feeling. Recommend clear coating them if yours will see salt. I didn't and they don' look so nice anymore...
B00SKUYSPA|5|Very nice product splash proof attached to my sit on top kayak seat worked wonderful would totally recommend for small boat I was given this product at a discount for my unbiased review
B0069CQG4W|5|Took about 2 hours to install using the excellent instructions.<br />You'll need to be an intermediate-level mechanic to pull this off.<br />You will be drilling big holes in the plastic of your xB!<br /><br />The cover looks great. A factory fitment.<br />There is a lot of space underneath and it snaps out when not needed.<br /><br />Thumbs up!
B00LQO8OE8|1|This is just a carabiner clip, albeit a very expensive one. As far as clips go, you could get a much sturdier one for 1/10th the price at the hardware store.  It does not work very well for the purpose of keeping the seat belt from digging into one's neck, and the seat belt keeps riding up making it rather uncomfortable.
B006LPW1DC|5|Sweet sticker, fast shipping totally satisfied. thank you!
B004LWVEKS|2|I ordered this charger for my marine AGM batteries in March of 2014. It worked great until about a month ago. Then it just quit and actually shocked me the last time I plugged it in. All the lights lit up on it and it continually beeped at me. I am writing this review to try to get help on getting it fixed or replaced. Please help.
B00CPKV8JU|5|Love this product!  Bought this to put on my boyfriends road king and wow what a difference.  I went 300 miles and could walk afterward....amazing!
B002XF7EQS|5|Looks great on my FX45
B00QMF1HCW|5|Absolutely a Perfect Fit! I highly recommend this hitch to anyone needing to pull a small trailer. Way cheaper than renting a u-haul. Easy to put on also.
B00JQ4FMEU|5|Perfect fit for my wheels
B00DSVMCQI|5|just what i expected
B00KPQYZ6O|5|I have 2003 travel trailer, with an I beam frame with a width of 66&#34;. I took a chance to see if this would work, since I had some basic knowledge with working with a welder and thought that I could shorten this to fit. Well, due to it's design, which I like, I was not able shorten the tubing to make it fit my narrower frame. So, I had some 2.5&#34; square tubing lying around, which I welded to the hinged hanger. This, along with longer bolts to mount to the frame made it work great. Now my tire is tucked away in a cozy spot away from Mr. Sun. Sure, the tire will pick up some dirt from a drive down the road, but most trailer towing vehicles have a tire under their body anyway. Now I don't have to keep replacing the vinyl spare tire covers that keep falling apart. Thanks.
B00HQCQYHI|1|Shredded almost instantly with very little use.
B006GHFXX0|5|exact replacement. visors now stay in place.
B00TAF5SQ2|5|Awesome product and will continue to buy. Very strong product
B000NPDL76|3|Good product but i received mind broken.
B01078GH6A|4|Great product! Only downside is the bag does not stay put and easily bored or of container when I put the windows down. Easily resolved by placing binder clips on it to hold the bag in place.
B00ROWM78A|4|When making these, the emblem on the left should have the  bottom of the anchor facing the marine corps emblem.
B000YMP1SA|5|i love this kit!!!!! the pump is soooo powerful for something so small!!!!! and i love also the bottle that plugs up the flat tire temporarily. it allows anyone to do it and not just someone who knows how to jack up a car and install a spare tire.
B00MOR4CFQ|5|Easy to install. Way brighter than halogen bulbs. I have been using them for 2 months now. No issues.
B002R0NP4E|5|It fits, it works, and it was cheap! What more could you want?
B00R244WFQ|5|The plasti wrap works great on my car .
B001UE9CHM|5|Fits Mazda Speed 3 2008.  Breaks cleaner than the OEM, was a very solid replacement.
B00QN8CP0G|2|Cheaply made, paper stuck on license plate frame.  Hard to read.  Not really happy with this purchase.
B010QXWUFS|4|oh nice key cover
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|Just received this got it programmed and it works great, I have a car that is paid in full and this is just I needed to help me with getting the kids in the car and my hands-free jobs.
B001P3035I|1|Dont last long at all. maybe 1 hr
B001KWG83A|5|nothing to complain about here - simple - it works!!
