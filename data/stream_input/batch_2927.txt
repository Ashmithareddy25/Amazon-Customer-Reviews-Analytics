B005LAIIN0|5.0|First of all, I must say that I am a huge vampire, zombie horror & science-fiction fan. I read all Stephen King novels, collect any horror, zombie, vampire, science fiction DVDs of all sorts. I own all of the original Planet of the Ape on Blu-ray, the  entire collection/ all seasons of the original back & white Rod Sterling's Twilight Zone. My father got me watching vampire movies when I was a little girl, as he is a huge horror fan, he remembers going seeing the first Dracula in the theaters for what I though he said was ten cents in those days. And the only reason why I have decided to explain this, is to show you that I'm not just some average movie watcher on the street, who happened to be excited that Brad Pitt was in a new movie. On the contrary, I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan, although I did find the movie Twelve Monkeys & Fight Club rather interesting.<br /><br />When I first found out Brad Pitt was in this movie, my first reaction was &#34;Oh great another Brad Pitt pretty boy movie&#34;. It was my 13-year-old son who explained to me that it was a zombie Movie. That definitely did spark my interest! Regardless of &#34;who&#34; plays in a zombie movie it's an automatic (we must go). This is because for any true horror/science-fiction fan, the movie (must) be watched and personally critiqued.<br /><br />What a delight! Such a spin off the modern slow moving zombie. I love this movie! In fact, in my personal opinion, I believe this is the best zombie movie to come out in over a decade with more modern graphics. And what do I think of the acting? Brilliant! I truly believe that Brad Pitt did a great job. One of the Best movie of the year for &#34;me&#34;! Still have to see Insidious 2, Riddick, and patiently awaiting Catching Fire. I know that I'm in love with any movie, when I run out to buy the book. In which, not only did I buy World War Z, the novel but I also bought The Zombie Survival Guide. Which is claimed to be a must read for any true zombie lover, by many online critics. But I will confess, that the series the &#34;Walking Dead&#34;  is by far my favorite of all, still ranks #1. for me.  So If you want to watch a Great zombie movie with a new cool spin on it,  watch World War Z!ny online critics. But I will confess, that the series the &#34;Walking Dead&#34;  is by far my favorite of all, still ranks #1. for me.

B008RA3X5E|3.0|I really like look of clock and that you can have the sound fade in. I also like the choices  of sounds to wake up to. Not the usual alarm sounds.

B000FA675C|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and was pleasantly surprised at how well they matched. Also, I could picture some of the scenes that may have been harder for me to visualize based solely on the printed words. I loved the mystery, twists and turns, and possibilities presented. This wasn't the first book I've read that made many of these claims, but it was definitely the most enjoyable (the other often felt more like textbooks).<br /><br />Ignore all the arguments about the validity of any of the issues and just enjoy a good story.

B00F6E4J2A|5.0|When the news broke that Elton John's next album would be a return to the early days of his recording career I thought to myself where have I heard that before. Oh yes I remember. On just about all of Elton's post 2000 albums something similar has been said about those albums. So when I heard that this album would feature primarily piano, bass and drums with guitar thrown in here and there, which is a return to Elton's early band of himself, Dee Murray on bass and Nigel Olsson on drums, I was not going to let myself get sucked in to the same hype we've heard for the last 12 years or so.<br /><br />And then I got a hold of a pre-release of the album. I have been listening for a solid week and I am thoroughly enjoying \\"The Diving Board\\". What surprises me the most is how well the songs work with the band configuration of a trio. There is an energy that has been lacking on some of Elton's recent work but it is back on this newest album, his first solo album since 2006.<br /><br />Anyone expecting to hear \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" or \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" or are comparing this album to the \\"classic years\\" that's just silly and a mistake. Oh he still rocks out in concert but you're not going to get that on new Elton albums these days. That's just not where he is these days.<br /><br />What I will say is that this album is the best thing he's done since \\"Songs From The West Coast\\" and it can stand on its own next to Elton's best work. The up tempo tunes all work. They all pass the skip test. The ballads are what Elton has always done best and he does not disappoint here. \\"Oceans Away\\" and \\"Voyeur\\" are the standouts for me as well as the single \\"Home Again\\". But's it's the up tempo tunes that are what surprised me the most. They carry the album in my opinion. For once the hype is justified.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is almost my favorite book! I love Greek mythology and all of Rick Riordan's books. Don't watch the movie though, it's awful! This book was epic! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!
B00AEFXNGE|4.0|I've seen this movie a few years ago and recently I rewatched it.<br /><br />Plot: It is a disaster movie, with 9/11 overtones. As a disaster movie it pays off well.<br /><br />Characters: Mildly interesting. They're common young adults caught in the middle of something they can't understand. I only midly cared for two or three of them. There's a bit of character development in their journey.<br /><br />Effects: Very well done. Best part of the movie.<br /><br />Atmosphere: Hiding the creature for most of the movie actually works here. It adds some welcome mystery element to it.<br /><br />Monster: A very weird but interesting creature. It pays homage to the Kaiju genre by it sheer size and by being a tragic figure that just wants to go back home. Reminded me of Gorgo but without the<br /><br /><<<<<<<Spoiler>>>>>>>>>><br /><br />happy ending, even if the 'Its alive' post credits easter egg leaves the ending open.<br /><br />Could have been done better but it is a good movie, worth of figuring among the best movies in both disaster and monster genres.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This is possibly the best of the original cast Star Trek films...I think that the acting was very good, including Mr. Montelban as Khan...I think the storyline was very good...and I liked the tie-in to the old series!
B00F4PVQO0|5.0|I first heard of Broadchurch while watching previews on Xfinity.  It seemed interesting enough to give the first episode a chance, and so I am now anxiously waiting for Episode 7 to air.  Broadchurch is an excellent crime drama.  The setting is realistic, and the characters well drawn and well developed.  The acting is top notch, as well, as British acting tends to be.  What is especially well done is the various ways in which the parents, sister, and grandmother of the murdered boy grieve for him.  As the storyline unfolds, viewers learn all sorts of interesting tidbits and secrets about the characters and their lives.  The writers have thus far presented the viewers with several plausible murder suspects, and very few residents of Broadchurch are above suspicion.  The contrasting personalitites of DI Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller, played by David Tennant and Olivia Colman, offer a great balancing act to the approach of handling the family, the media, the suspects, and the case.  Tennant and Colman are the anchors of this cast.  Broadchurch hits the ground running in Episode 1, and moves at a pace which keeps viewers engaged.  As this is a mini-series, the case will be solved and explained by the end of Episode 8, although given the quality of the acting and the writing, many viewers will probably be left wanting more Broadchurch.
B00003XAVA|5.0|If you like Crosby, Stills and Nash...you will probably like this CD. It is very reminiscent of CSN in its' rich harmonies!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This isn't one of those books, \\"you just can't put down\\" at least not for me. There were A LOTof characters introduced right from the beginning. While I enjoyed learning the background story on each of them, the story just took too long to develop. Once it did however (60%through the book,) it became a more enjoyable read with a thicker plot. I also enjoyed how all of the characters stories intertwined throughout each other & that made it more exciting to follow. My favorite part of the book was the last couple chapters & the epilogue. I would consider this book a good vacation read.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Loved it! I got really wrapped up in the characters. Was very sad to get to the end of the series.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|While not perfect, I did enjoy this new version of Star Trek (as well as its 2009 predecessor).  I found that the actors portray the original characters very well, convincingly capturing their personalities and appearance while, at the same time, making them their own.<br />What particularly helps is that I view these as I complete reboot, and in no way try to tie this into the original Trek universe (despite old Spoke's involvement).  (To me, trying to link these to the old series is as crazy as trying to link the Dark Knight saga to the old Tim Burton Batman movies.)<br />The other is being honest. Let's face it, the original Star Trek movies were a mixed bag. Half were really good (2,4,6) and half stank (1,3,5). Nor were they as deep as people would like to believe. Yes they spoke of high minded ideals (most that would never work in real life - such as the idea that all mankind simply works for the mutual benefit of society, obeying their superiors with a smile, and with no thought of personal gain other than the satisfaction of a job well done), but in the end, a lot came down to who had the superior firepower/military tactics anyway. (Oh, and to those that claim that this movie is not Sci-Fi because to is not focused on the technology, the tech described in TOS, and especially TNG, was nothing but techno-babble.)<br />This movie, as its predecessor, was a fun action flick that paid homage to an enjoyable franchise that was fun to watch, but should never have been taken as seriously as it has been.<br />There are a few concerns with this movie, however, especially for parents who are wandering if they should let their children watch. There is one completely pointless scene of Kirk in bed with two lady aliens (it's only purpose, I suppose, is to reinforce the notion that he's a lady's man - which is shown easily enough with the way Kirk is distracted by anyone walking by with a skirt), and a scene in which Carol Marcus strips down to her underwear (the only purpose seeming to be to show off Alice Eve in as little as possible). Because of these two scenes, though rather brief, I find the movie to be less than suitable for impressionable children.<br />** Possible spoiler **<br />My only other real criticism of the film is the beginning portion with the sick child. I know it was to foreshadow the effects of Khan's blood, but the somber tone of those scenes felt completely out of place with the rest of the movie, especially since it tries to pull the heartstrings for a little girl that is never again seen in the movie.
B004S7VQT0|3.0|There are a number of positive reviews of Mohsin Hamid's novel and the author Kiran Desai calls it \\"brilliant.\\" With all due respect, I think Mr. Desai needs to read a little more. It was not one but two of these kinds of reviews that led me to this story and it is definitely an interesting story. Hamid skillfully creates interesting characters and a narrative that keeps the reader engaged, which is not an easy thing given the structural nature of using his lead character's autobiographical monologue as the narrative method. It's a well-told tale that follows the Aristotelian rules of drama but then there is the problem of the ending or maybe the fact that there really isn't an ending. Hamid decided to leave it unclear as to how the story ends and while this might not be a problem for some readers, I found it disappointing. It reminded me of Peggy Lee's rendition of the Leiber-Stoller song Is That All There is? Maybe there will be a sequel so we can figure out how the story ended. Maybe that was the plan all along.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great way to escape. It moves so fast you can't focus on anything but the next obstacles.  Great fun. Try it!

B00D2PIUAM|5.0|I remember a few  years ago, a friend asked me what Placebo sounded like. I stumbled around with responses like \\"British pop with glam overtones\\", \\"Brit alternative but a bit Bowie-ish\\", \\"catchy combo of pop and alternative rock\\". All of the above? None of the above?? I know that for fifteen years now (wow - that long??) Placebo has captured my attention because of that very conundrum. They are alternative, they are glam-ish, and they are hard-yet-poppy. Maybe, too, it was the unique vocals that won me over (he has annoyed others, but Brian Molko's voice decidedly defines them). By the time the last album \\"Battle for the sun\\" rolled around, the band had obviously decided that making (another) play for success in America meant jettisoning their current sound for a harder, more obvious \\"American alternative\\" approach. Unfortunately, that was my least favorite Placebo release since the first album. Harder, guitar-edged and loud meant out goes the quirkiness, the ballads, the keyboards, the quieter moments - in general, their overall creativity was taking a back seat to being \\"heavy\\", and it just didn't fit. Other than Molko's distinctive voice, that album sounded like a hundred other bands to me, but I'm glad to report that Placebo are back with their best record since \\"Sleeping with Ghosts\\". This time, Molko's not afraid of being vulnerably mellow, and outside-the-comfort-zone creative - in both composition and instrumentation, with a nice return of stringed instruments and keyboards to many of these songs - not out of place, by the way, if you look back at their American breakthrough album (and my first foray into Placeboworld) \\"Without you I'm nothing\\". That was a generally quiet and often somber affair, and this new one sees them making a welcome return to that form. The b-side \\"Pity Party (of one\\") is also not to be missed, a beautiful, sublime ballad that's simply icing on the cake.
1451695195|5.0|It was interesting to me to read of a near death/after death experience from someone of a trained medical background.  I enjoyed it and see truth in it because of my beliefs.  It's risky to put yourself &#34;out there&#34; like this.  I very much admire Dr. Alexander for his courage!
B00BHMF578|5.0|I don't like war movies and I'm not particularly fond of films with middle-eastern settings because of the extreme tension that always seems to come with it. But surprisingly, not only did I enjoy this film, I found myself wanting to own a copy of it. I was too young to care when all this went down in real life, so I have no reference point for comparison with the truth. The story was compelling and there was just enough humor to keep the tension in check and make this an enjoyable film.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It's so rich. Tender, sensitive, believable and authentic.  The author has the gift of expressing the feelings of each character. One must read it again...
B00E34A9FU|5.0|As a public service for anyone, who, like me, collects Dark Stars; and is likely to purchase this specifically because it has Dark Star...rest assured: it's up there with the all-time classics.  This Dark Star (over 30 minutes) is uniquely dreamy & jazzy smooth. Jerry hits extremely sweet & lovely high notes throughout.  It successfully sustains a magical momentum all the way, sort of a crystalline perfection with no sour notes, and a hint of trippy intensity right where it belongs.  There's even a nice Phil bass solo.  This Dark Star exemplifies a true \\"lose yourself in the music\\" vibe that utopias are (or ought to be) all about.
B00003CXTG|1.0|With the special effects of today's movie-making business, I eagerly anticipated this World War II movie, as I study the Pacific War quite avidly. I went and saw it opening weekend for my birthday in 2001.<br /><br />I could not have been more disappointed!<br /><br />While the special effects were good, I'll give it that, and the attack scene was well-done, the historical accuracy was abysmal. Michael Bay might as well not even had historical advisors on this film, for he sure as hell didn't listen to them. At the scene in New York alongside the Queen Mary, it shows her being painted gray (by that time, she'd already been painted gray for awhile), in the Pearl Harbor attack scene you have Japanese Zeros flying over MODERN U.S. Navy warships docked in the harbor, and the Doolittle Raid is launched from a MODERN-DAY carrier with a number '8' painted on the deck to symbolize U.S.S. Hornet! Disgraceful! There was a group of WWII veterans sitting behind me in the theater, and they got up and walked out, and I couldn't blame them one bit. And on top of all these gross historical inaccuracies, we also have to deal with some crap-ass love triangle.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want to see a movie about Pearl Harbor, get \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" and skip this piece of crap completely. If Amazon.com had a 'Zero Star' rating, I'd give it to this film.<br /><br />And Michael Bay, stick to directing purely fiction-based films like \\"Transformers\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\", because you have absolutely NO sense of history.

How many times do we have to read about them lighting up, inhaling, exhaling, looking in their pockets for a pack, bumming one, etc. etc. Enough already. Harry drank a lot too. I think these traits took away from the story, which, in terms of plot etc. was very good.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|If you can get past the long digressions -- battle of Waterloo, Parisian street urchins, Paris' underground sewer layout -- and the out-of-date name-dropping, there is an interesting and unusual plot behind all this.  Make no mistake though, those digressions play a role in the weaving of this plot.  If one has the patience there are some really interesting character studies to be noted.  I found it extremely helpful to occasionally reference the Wikipedia article on Les Miserables to remind me of character names and connections; I would not have understood the story nearly as well without this assistance.<br /><br />This book will take some time to read -- I started in May and finally finished in September, reading from between 15 minutes and an hour at a time.  Be ready to see a LOT of difficult-to-pronounce French names.<br /><br />Ron Parker<br />The Voice of the Turtle<br />Minnetonka, MN. USA

B0074QGGK6|3.0|This book was ok.  Im not a fan of self help books because they use a broad brush approach and generally talk down to their audience. This book didn't claim to solve a problem but rather offered hints on how to broaden your creative tendencies.  I personally think it takes much much more than what the author suggests but its a start.  I felt the urge to doodle if nothing else.
B00D2I8E46|4.0|\\"Wise Up Ghost.\\" In which two of the music world's encyclopedic nerds play with Costello's past and Questlove's concepts of pop and funk. Musically it is a fascinating record, with the two of them combining bits of Elvis' older tunes with deeply funked out basslines, boiling things to a rare essence; the songs that equal or surpass the originals.<br /><br />For example, just as deep as the second song, sample lyrics from \\"Sweet Underground\\" and \\"Hurry Down Doomsday\\" are tangled together to create \\"Sugar Won't Work.\\" Or how \\"Stick Out Your Tongue\\" rewrites \\"Pills and Soap,\\" one of Costello's angriest protest songs. Which is something else to note about \\"Wise Up Ghost.\\" The Roots place a lot of dark menace into songs that weren't as sinister as they were when they started out life.<br /><br />Even the samples spin things around. The tinkling piano of \\"Satellite\\" tease \\"Tripwire\\" into a more spooky area, along with the subject matter. Questlove and Elvis don't just stick with the lyrical cut and pasting, songs are pulled into the sampler like \\"Satellite,\\" as well as \\"Radio Silence\\" on the (bonus track version) \\"Can You Hear Me.\\"<br /><br />It's not like Elvis hasn't explored collaborations and re-visiting before. This comes closer to \\"The River In Reverse,\\" with Allen Toussaint and the roaring Stax romp of \\"Get Happy\\" than other Costello works, while The Roots bring out the moments when Costello becomes more a sublime singer, even though there's more than a little menace to the demanding title track or \\"Stick Out Your Tongue.\\" \\"Wise Up Ghost\\" may sound like a mismatch of talents, but The Roots make this album into one of Costello's most interesting in a long time.

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|MUD<br /><br />Coming of age stories have always been a favorite of mine if they are done right. \\"Stand By Me\\" comes right to mind as a classic coming of age story. Well this Matthew McConaughey lead film is right up there as one of those done right. Now I have always liked Matt and never really understood the hate that people place on him. I will admit that I have liked some of his romantic comedies. I went to my Aunt's house to see this movie as we all do from time to time. After it was over we all agreed that \\"Mud\\" was a really good film.<br /><br />Ellis and Neckbone are best friends and are always looking to have a good time and go on that great adventure we all dream of. They find their chance when they decide to go to a small island on the Mississippi in Arkansas. Once there they find a boat that is up in a tree, they have to investigate. They soon realize [after finding some interesting reading material] that someone is living there. A drifter named \\"Mud\\" who befriends the kids and even gets them to help him out. Just what he wants their help for leads the boys into the biggest and most dangerous adventure they will ever know.<br /><br />Writer/director Jeff Nichols' did an excellent job with this film as his direction and script flowed so smoothly. A story like this in the wrong hands or off just a bit in the writing department could easily have been for lack of a better word boring. But Nichols' manages to keep you hooked until the credits role in this tale of love, betrayal, murder, and growing up. Also the look and feel of this film only adds to the experience, you almost feel like you are there.<br /><br />This movie was also superbly acted by the entire cast, from the leads to the supporters. Most of the praise has gone to McConauahey and rightfully so as he has been on a role lately with his performances. He is great here as Mud and from what I have read he was actually who Nichols' wrote the part for in the 90's or something like that. Nay way I haveto say that the two kids here [Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland] did just as good as their famous co star. This story really is more about them and Tye's \\"Ellis\\" in particular. It is through Ellis that the story moves and thus the role had to have been cast perfectly, it was. Also all three of these character's guardians were just as well cast and all play a major role in the personalities of the lead trio.<br /><br />This was a great movie full of great scenery and cinematography that gives this Arkansas based film a feeling of being real. The characters here seem like real people and it is because of that that you actually care about these people. Now this is not the greatest movie ever made, at least to me, but it is a really good one that I would recommend. this is a really well made drama that has made my list of best I have seen this year.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I decided to read more of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books and bought 7 more, going back to early novels.  What a wonderful story Die Trying turned out to be.  Child's second novel is as good as his last one.  The detail is overwhelming, the excitement grows as the story builds.  Jack Reacher is a true hero as are the FBI agents, especially Holly.  Holly is a wonderful character, who I hope will reappear in a future novel.  These books are nothing but fun!

B008YKGQR4|1.0|Read some reviews and thought, &quot;Oh great...exactly what I've been looking for, a Facebook app that will allow desktop view!!&quot; Well, unfortunately, it did not work out that way...in fact, it did not work out at all...it wouldn't even load. I tried several times but all I got was a black screen with the words, Full Facebook Free, in they upper left hand corner. Needless to say, Iam thoroughly disappointed once again...I thought this would be a really good thing but I was duped again by rave reviews. So, I am back to square one...I'm totally convinced that there is no such thing as a good Facebook app. :(

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|So this is.my fifth gameloft app I've tried, and I spend all day cycling through them upgrading and collecting from buildings amongst other things.  If you like army type games this is a good one along with your base building and trying to max out your units to wipe the floor with everyone who dares to attack.  I don't usually like.paying for a game I can play free but I've already dropped 10 bucks in the first 2 days which says something about how much I've been enjoying it.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|and it was funny. I tried and tried,but I could not picture Keanu Reeves as a Doctor,let a lone an admirer of Diane Keatons character. She looked too old for even him. That threw the movie off for me. Then finally it became believable, when she finally ends up crying up a storm,and convincingly ,every woman knew her pain and her tears that were perfect.  It is a great movie with a supposingly nude scene,where you really see nothing. I enjoyed that it was true to life and Jack Nicholson was at his best. These 2 shoudl make another movie together.....Worth  buying and watching
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keeps me guessing.  search games beware!  reminds me of the puzzles I had to solve in my mystery case files games.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great read is right! The story is so beautifully crafted that it is a pleasure to see it unfold. The author was able to take several all too familiar tragedies and combine them into something new. As such, I happily dismiss any faults I may have glancingly noticed. This is the first time I feel ready to recommend a &#34;crime&#34; novel!<br /><br />S. B. Tier

B000I3SYEI|5.0|Sound and picture quality are excellent.  Extra features are interesting as well.  This blu-ray disc is a great value and I highly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I ordered the book because 1) it had a lot of great reviews and 2) it was affordable. I started the book on a Saturday afternoon and finished it on a Saturday afternoon. I knew exactly what happened within the first 20 pages or so, but for some reason, I kept reading. I think because I realized this was the first time I'd ever read a book written by an Australian and actually set in Australia. I liked these Australians, despite the relentless dreariness of all of their lives. I wanted to come away despising all of the characters, and while I was really annoyed at the predictability of the storyline, I actually liked the characters. I'm not sure why. We could have done without the \\"what if\\" explanations, although they didn't really hurt the story. In the end, though, I cannot put my finger on what made me keep reading. But I do think it's an imminently forgettable book.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Bloody, Bloody, Bloody good fun! Well if you liked the cheeky original you still might like this. It is darker and more gruesome than the original but that is because the special effects are so good! It is dark, gritty and full of gore. The special effects are stellar and worth going for the ride. Try it, you might like it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book, couldn't put it down! I would definitely recommend it to everyone! It is like 50 shades of gray but BETTER!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is a great game. Cannot believe it is free. Love the fact that you can earn free credits as well.... must have game for anyone e who likes shooters...
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|Hes old, i get it, but the acting not just from him but the others... UHHGGG. The plot, its terrible. But this is why we wait for movies to come out on DVD. lol
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|At the beginning I was lost with all the stories but once they start to connect, the book was unstoppable! Loved the message at the end! A really enjoyable book that will make your emotions run crazy!
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I loved the show. It is not for young audiences.  Too much nudity and violence.  It interested me so much I wound up looking up the bio s of all the main characters. Fun to watch
B008IGP8LY|2.0|I received the vinyl edition of the \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" OST as a birthday gift in July. The quality of the vinyl is terrible, and the one I received was warped by shipping, or so I thought. Soon enough, the vinyl was returned and I was sent a new one by the manufacturer through Amazon. This one was also warped, and I can only assume that all the vinyls produced in that batch, or even by the manufacturer, are in such shoddy shape. The playback is warped and the sheen given off by the face reflects the warp strongly. It is VERY, VERY WARPED!<br /><br />Not only is the vinyl quality horrendous, the sleeve it came in fell apart BOTH TIMES I GOT THE VINYL, with the sides' glue unsticking and splitting the sleeve in half! Ridiculous. Unless you plan on hanging it up as a memento because you love the film, this is not your deal.<br /><br />Now the only reason this gets a 2 star review instead of 1 is because the vinyl came with a download code for the MP3 format album.<br /><br />Do NOT buy the vinyl if you value product quality over the memorabilia value of it.<br /><br />Otherwise, the soundtrack is fantastic! But deeply disappointed by the vinyl edition.
0071762345|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading Dave's book on social media.  Social media is the future of all marketing for small and medium businesses, yet these business owners do not know that there is a better way to market and advertise their businesses outside of traditional media (i.e. billboards, radio ads, TV informercials / commercials).<br /><br />This book here is a perfect gameplan for any business to start building a more engaging and interactive online presence with their customers, clients, fans, followers and subscribers.  I could not put the book down, for each chapter has so much value within it.  It almost looks like a coloring book, for I have highlighted so much of it within its numerous lessons and case studies.<br /><br />I definitely will keep this book nearby me at my desk.  And I definitely highly recommend this book to anyone serious about social media marketing for themselves and / or their businesses.
0345803450|4.0|McEwan's tale of espionage and romance set in the depths of the cold war and economic hardship in England, the early 70s, centers on the very crux of spying:  trust and deception.  And then there's what people will do to each other in the name of love, which often isn't pretty, especially when it involves a triangle, of sorts.<br /><br />Serena Frome, who tells the tale, is a bright and attractive young woman who would prefer reading novels to taking her maths degree at Cambridge, as her mother insists, with the idea Serena might achieve some measure of independence.  Serena gets involved with an older man, a professor, who had once worked for MI5.  She leads a pleasant life with him, if somewhat indolent, until he abruptly dumps her.  But she does have him to thank for deciding her on employment in the intelligence agency.  She enters at the lowest level, there with other young women, restricted in their advancement potential by an unhealthy dose of sexism.  Good fortune, it seems, finds her, though, when she's assigned to a project named Sweet Tooth.  Sweet Tooth requires her to snare a fiction writer with potential.  The idea behind the project, which already has a handful of non-fiction writers on board (though none know the money they receive comes from the agency; all top secret), is to win over the hearts and minds of people by exerting British cultural influence.  The project imitates what the Americans and Russians already do.  The writer they select for her is an aspiring novelist who has attracted literary attention with several published short stories.  Serena accomplishes her mission, but as time goes on, she pays a price.<br /><br />Serena falls in love with the novelist Tom Haley as she reads his stories and becomes familiar with him; you might describe it as imitate with his mind.  He, in turn, falls in love with her.  Shortly, they see each other almost every weekend.  However, Serena has a serious problem.  If she reveals she works for MI5 and they are funding him, Tom will surely sever both his book deal and his affair with her.  If she doesn't admit to what is really happening and the relationship blossoms into a wedding, she may find herself living a lie for their entire lives.  She wrestles with this for the entire novel, until the end, when some startling information shows up.<br /><br />Since Serena tells the story, we have only what she sees, thinks, and experiences as a guide to what may be occurring beyond her five senses.  Naturally, this being the world of espionage, something does stir.  What I cannot say without spoiling the book for you.  But I can advise you to pay close attention to Tom's various stories, recounted for us by Serena.  It spoils nothing to say hidden in each you will discover a clue to the finale.<br /><br />As you might have guessed, while a spy thriller of sorts and a romance, it's also a story about a moral dilemma.  In the end, you'll have to decide whether Serena made the right choice.<br /><br />Well written, offering up sufficient color, much wit, even more cleverness, enough history to enlighten us on spy agencies, plenty of romance, and a twist at the end.  Worthy of your time.are funding him, Tom will surely sever both his book deal and his affair with her.

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a wondrous tale about an orphan child on a journey to discover the secrets of a broken automaton left by his father. The story follows young Hugo, a secretive boy, in 1930's France as he tries to fix the automaton. Along the way he meets some curious characters, who also have their own secrets. This tale is cleverly designed as a children's novel but appeals to readers of all ages. While the large amount of illustrations makes it seem more childish, those images are what make the story so riveting and unique. Through the ups and downs you'll be on the edge of your set anxiously waiting to turn the page to see what lies next in Hugo's incredible adventure!<br />This novel is the winner of the 2008 Caldecott Medal. The Caldecott Medal is given to an American illustrator of the most distinguished American children's book of the year.
B00EQUP3Q6|4.0|When I had read that Hesitation Marks was looking back at The Downward Spiral and that Russell Mills was returning to do the artwork as well, I was excited. I had always loved the strange audio textures and loops from that era (screams looped again and again, etc). The crazy juxtaposition of sounds. When I first listened to Hesitation Marks I was disappointed. But it's their fault for bringing up The Downward Spiral. :) But I kept listening to it for a week straight. And along the way I liked more and more of the music.<br /><br />First the bad for me: I need more drums, big drums. One or two more songs with big drums smashing through them would really strengthen this album. And one more less conventional song (less verse, chorus, verse, etc.) would really make my day. And my two favorite songs are the instrumentals which are WAY too short. If \\"The Eater of Dreams\\" could have been worked into a five minute song I would be in heaven. It has all the elements there already to become something as strong as \\"Eraser\\" was (is). The same thing with \\"Black Noise\\" just a minute or two more would have been a beautiful heaven of crawling chaotic sound. Oh well, maybe next time. :) I think songs five through eight are where this album falls apart (\\"All Time Low\\" thru \\"Satellite\\"). They are just way too funky and pop for me... but even the songs I dislike get stuck in my head.<br /><br />Now for the good: The album starts off good on songs one thru four. And picks up again on songs nine thru the ending. These later songs do a few unexpected things, and that grew on me. They kind of broke with his usual formula (and thank god he isn't saying \\"Hey!\\" on this album). \\"Various Methods of Escape\\" has a good chorus which stays with you. My favorite song with lyrics here is \\"In Two\\" this song seems less 'lazy' than a few of the other songs can sometimes sound. And goes off in a few different directions. The beginning 30 seconds of it are great, brooding and atmospheric, right up there with the beginning of \\"Gave Up\\". So, ten out of fourteen songs sure ain't bad.<br /><br />I'd say this album is better than The Slip (definitely) Year Zero, and (of course) much better than With Teeth. It sits right under the Fragile and Pretty Hate Machine... and of course my all time favorites are his two chaotic albums. ;)<br /><br />After all this time no'one still quite sounds like Nine Inch Nails.th the beginning of \\"Gave Up\\".

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|the Bible is not a book of history,but a book of faith and belief. Reza has gone to great lengths to investigate the historical Jesus. Her writing is clear and I have found the book fascinating. She does not treat Jesus as a god,but as a real human being and the times in which he lived. The less religious you are,the more you will enjoy this book as it is not a faith based book but a fact based book. I highly recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I downloaded this app a few months ago for my kids to be able to watch YouTube. The ads were really annoying so I decided to go ahead a pay for the app to remove them. I added the app to each of my kids free time and it does not remove the ads. In fact it acts like I didn't even purchase it. YouTube and kindle need to work something out to get an official YouTube app.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Weakest part first:<br />- Carnies is probably the weakest track on this album. It's a decent song, just not great.<br /><br />My favorites:<br />- BU2B, a critique of the &#34;God industry&#34; and how we curse our children with its gospel. Musically and lyrically hard hitting.<br />- Halo Effect, a power ballad that I would ordinarily dismiss, but the lyrics hit close to home for me. I think we've all made the mistake of projecting our romantic/narcissistic fantasies onto another at some point in our lives.<br />- Seven Cities of Gold, guitar work kinda reminds of Rage Against the Machine. A good old fashioned rock-n-roll song.<br />- The Wreckers, a lyrically powerful song. Material is familiar to anyone who has recovered from the shock of grief (divorce, death, terminal diagnosis, etc) with an acceptance of peace.<br />- Headlong Flight, another good old fashioned rock-n-roll song.<br /><br />Lyrically, I think this is Rush's most powerful work. Listen to Vapor Trails and Clockwork Angels back-to-back and you can see a definite thread of emotional recovery.<br /><br />Though I'm a long-time fan of Rush, I don't buy their music or attend their concerts for the 'classic rock legacy' act. In particular I found this album and Vapor Trails among their best work ever. I sincerely hope they play more of these songs live in the future...
1105495957|5.0|In this memoir, which one gathers is at least semi-non-fictional, Orwell takes a voluntary excursion into poverty to see how the other half lives.  He accepts most of the miseries of dire poverty with literary good humor, but all of this in the end is grist for his socialist mill.  He seems genuinely indignant that poverty should exist in the modern world, arguing that there is no inherent difference between the well off and the dirt poor that justifies this arrangement, but like most socialists he is better at identifying the problems than proposing a workable remedy.  But despite the subdued note of social protest this is quite an interesting memoir, full of memorable stories and characters inhabiting the underworlds of Paris and London, rendered with Orwell's inimitable English irony.  That Orwell's poverty was voluntary and not forced is testified to by the book itself; most people who fall into the pit of poverty never emerge to tell the tale. A good story by a good sort of bloke.
B0063FGG22|5.0|Astonishingly, those words are uttered by Leonard (Martin Landau) to Phillip VanDamm (James Mason) as he warns his suave, impossibly handsome boss that he suspects Mr. VanDamm's mistress  (Eva Marie Saint) to be a double-agent. \\"Are you jealous?\\"  VanDamm responds. True, I never noticed that homoerotic angle until I watched the movie a second time. Although NORTH BY NORTHWEST is ostensibly a \\"wrong man\\" chase thriller,  Hitchcock is a master of telling good stories laced with an undercurrent of sex and desire...second to none. How the director suggests ... rather than spell it out explicitly...has always made him a superior director than just about anyone today.<br /><br />And the Bernard Hermann score is heart-stopping - one of the best fusions of music to film in the business.  Just minor alterations of tone, pacing, and volume changes moods from mysterious to romantic to dangerous and back again. The music can make you grip your seat.<br /><br />In the last 50 years, no action movie has topped the desperate escape attempt on top of Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock captures the scene as if the very souls of the Great Presidents were helping Cary Grant in his patriotic mission.<br /><br />There are precious few movie lists that won't have this film among the top 100.  It is easy to understand why.
0307271609|5.0|This book is filled with political intrigue and the usual manipulation of who gets to rule China.  Like most reviews, I never heard of Cixi before this book and while it was an interesting story,it was hard to follow all the names and figure out who was who and what they did.  Cixi is a controversial figure and I still can't determine which one is the 'true' Cixi.  The really fun part of the book was her description of her retirement years in her old age.  She sounds like woman enjoying a childhood she never had.  I gave it 5 stars because it was well researched and all in all it was an interesting story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The kindle version seems to have finally gotten updated so its like what I have on my android phone which makes me very happy! It no longer force closes, my quick picks do actually change now and what I really love is the link that comes up saying \\"pinned to \\" with the board name so I can 1 know for sure I didn't accidentally pick the wrong one and 2 have quick access to my pin & the board I pinned it to. THANK YOU!!!
034580404X|2.0|Overrated.  Poorly written.  Sexual bru ha ha.  Media Hyped.  Good read to put you to bed, and I mean asleep.
B005K17RU0|5.0|the AccuWeather app had everything i needed to see and more. it is well organized and easy to get to. probably the best weather app for kindle, maybe even all android and smart devices.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|So I love what it does, when it works well.  Easy to use BUT if you have a lot of devices in your house sharing the wifi... it just won't work without stuttering.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|It was great. The one kid with all his gadgets. The story was good. The trouble shuffle was funny. Assume.
B003XURDAY|5.0|Obviously a cult classic but a must watch for those interested in dystopias.  There is so much that is wonderful about this movie: the images, the dark shadows everywhere, the confusion, the bustle of the streets.... It is interesting to note that almost all of my present college-age students haven't even heard of this movie.  Such a crime!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Talking parrot ('pieces of eight'), &#34;Fifteen men on the dead man's chest— Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&#34;, Long John Silver; this is just plain fun and surprisingly well written.

B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This is a great film and adaptation of how the government would respond to a zombie apocalypse. I loved it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I originally had the Weather Channel app, but they changed their look and I didn't like it so I got this one, It is definately the better app of the two. There is a lot more you can find out about the weather and it is more accurate. MUST GET!!

B008JFLWLE|5.0|This calculator is great!  It is so much easier to use than pushing buttons and it is forcing my kids to form letters correctly and legibly.  They get upset with me when I tell them to rewrite a 5 because it looks like a 2, for example, but they don't argue with the kindle fire and this app!  It's one of my new favorite homeschool tools!  They are using it to check their math problems after they do them by hand.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|I would love to live in the community of Gordonston.  Have a small group of friends, solve mysterys- or as they have done, create mystery.  Hired Killer?  Jealousy rages, would you hire someone to kill?  You will never guess who is next.
B006QSLBC6|4.0|A hilarious movie about 3 guys, a divorced office worker (played by Jack Black), a rich company owner (played by Steve Martin), and the continuing champion (played by Owen Wilson) out traveling across the states of America, competing for the title in a competition, known as the Big Year. Each going through problems of their own, and competing against thousands of other competitors. This is a great movie to watch, especially with it having so many great actors, I highly recommend you rent it (before you go off and buy it).
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It's a plausible story line with a twist, what's not to love!?! Oh yeah, Tom Cruise, but at least he is not overplayed in this one. All in all, I very much liked this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This device was a real disappointment! I was under the impression that the Chromecast would work with my beloved Kindle Fire HD and I was so excited over all the possibilities and especially since it was only $35.00, what a wonderful thing! Well forget it folks. Once I connected the device to my TV and followed the directions for visiting the Google.com/Chromecast/Setup website and logging in to my chrome (gmail) account which was required to complete the setup process for the Chromecast device, my progress was halted! Before I could even acquire the free Chromecast App, a warning came up that informed me that I did not have any devices! I realized that they were telling me that I did not have any \\"Google devices\\" and as I read further into the Google website, it was mentioned that the Chromecast was not for use with the Kindle Fire HD or Amazon Prime! So why wasn't that information made blatantly available and clear before I spent my $35.00? I went on a search for a solution hoping that someone would give me some help. Yes there are a few idiot Individuals on YouTube who talk very fast so you can't understand them but after replaying their clips a few times you will learn that getting the Chromecast App on to your Kindle is all that you have to do and of course they are all doing it through \\"Jailbreak\\" websites that carry risky viruses and possible identity theft leaks. I was tempted but thankfully Amazon made that endeavor impossible since I couldn't get anything to download to my Kindle Fire HD unless it is in the Amazon App store (even though I have selected the option to allow applications from unknown sources to download onto my Kindle which I activated from the \\"settings\\" menu on my Kindle Fire). So now I'm stuck with this really useless device that only individuals who own Google devices should buy! I believe that Communication should have been much clearer about the compatibility of the Chromecast with other devices instead of misleading people into thinking that you can use the Chromecast on any smartphone or (Kindle)tablet out there. It's very clear to me that this is all just a marketing/selling plot by Google to get you to buy their \\"compatible only with Google\\" device and then maybe you might buy there Nexus devices just to get it to work! I can only imagine the millions of dollars that Google has made from the high hopes of technophiles like me around the world with this crafty ruse on the public. Please save your $35.00 dollars for something else that really works and doesn't make you waste hours of time trying to find a solution when there isn't one! Anyway, I don't know whether to put my Chromecast on the shelf and hope that one day Google will make things possible for me to use it or just send it back?
B0034G4P8A|5.0|For years I was shocked that Marvel failed to put any real video out on the market. While DC seemed obsessed with repeating Batman to the point of being sickening.<br /><br />Now we finally get to see some of the Marvel universe and Thor is an excellent contribution to the world. Marvel has taken a classic character from their many universes and woven it into its own original story.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who has enjoyed Marvel Comics, looking for a good action movie, or just wants to understand the universe that is Marvel.
140006922X|4.0|Excellent & interesting book. Gives a good description of the life around the times of Jesus life. Very thought provoking.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Out of all the Batman movies, I personally enjoyed this one. DC has had the market for videos for what seems like decades. Yet, for whatever reason they choose to repeat the exact same set over and over. This version of Batman does a great job of standing on its own. With movie 1 and 2 being my personal favorites of this series of batman.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who enjoys DC, action, or just Batman movies. Be prepared for a darker theme, as you cannot have batman without the darkness.
B006Y9BVRM|1.0|the clock stopped working in 4 months of use.<br /><br />use the clock just to ride, not used for diving.<br />the clock just stopped working without explanation, is beautiful, but I was disappointed with this defect; consulted the manufacturer, SEIKO, the USA, which reported that the watch has international warranty in the first year, but here in Brazil, where I live, technical assistance to accredited informed that the product purchased outside of Brazil is not warranted here, it was the injury, as it is impractical to mail here from Brazil to the U.S., I do not know how to solve it.<br />I'm sad.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Glad I saw this film. - Excellent and a bit of a surprise, too. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes love stories - even difficult ones.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie just rocked my world! I was absolutely blown away. Fantastic acting. Stunning fight scenes. Best movie I've seen in a looong time. A little language that I didn't like. Overall 9 thumbs up! ---dont' ask ;-)
B00000IMTH|4.0|i remember waiting eagerly for the album to be released and once having listened to it a couple of times being left somewhat clueless regarding the sound. bass tracks seemed to have been recorded according to the who-to-blame section, but where had they gone? the sound still has not improved. blackmore does not seem to care, because he is busy producing kitsch.<br />and i wonder why most of the songs were never played live. imagine the on-stage power of a piece like l.a. connection or gates of babylon, the latter one of rainbow's masterpieces. only kill the king made to the stage and came over us like a hurricane in 1976.<br />anyway, this is an almost great record. so, go and get it, turn up the volume so that you won't hear your neighbours complaining...

1401233376|3.0|The whole comic is on youtube but I felt like owning it,.....  that orange light of avarice really took it's hold on me.<br />Anyway, the art is nice for the most part but some characters are really disappointing, aquaman, for example look way too small to pose a threat, and he barely makes an appearance for more than a page. If you've heard about this story, then you've probably already know what it's about. By itself it's disappointing, but with proper knowledge and appreciation of why it was necessary, then it becomes a must own for those who began with Crisis on Infinite Earths, like myself.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|This is not a &#34; I would watch it again &#34; movie like the others.  It has some very, very predictable situations in it.  I found myself getting bored through most of it...<br /><br />There are also some spots that just don't make since because of poor editing, and at the end of the movie it is as if the decided how it would end at the last minute and even the actors are not convinced of it and it comes across as so...<br /><br />...you can almost hear them thinking...really?  what Moran decided that ?  Still, it is Bruce Willis...and it is good, just not great...great special effects....and a great plot that could have been a really great movie...but isn't.

B00A3XQVKW|4.0|I liked this book.  It is well written and obvious that Ms. Eadie believes what she writes.  I don't want to be a spoiler but I loved the part about the the little girl. While I'm not sure that I find the idea of the choice to come to earth as an alcoholic or disabled theologically sound it didn't stop me from enjoying the story.  While &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34; is similar to &#34;Embraced by the Light&#34; I found Ms. Eadie's book more believable and I plan on reading her other work.

0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key was one of the best book I have read in the last 5 years.  Hands down.  This book sparked for me a new interest in WWII.  I have gone on to read about 2 dozen WWII books after this one.  This book takes place in Paris and deals with the round up of Jews that happened there.  Sarah is arrested with her family but locks her little brother in a cabinet before leaving.  A cabinet they would often play in.  Telling him she would return to get him out. Needless to say there is some suspense in this story until you find out whether the brother ever got out of the locked cabinet.  You figure eventually  he gets out, but the question of whether he was found in time or not keeps you in suspense for some time throughout the book.  This story is hard to read at times but hard to put down all the time.  I found the characters in the book endearing and likable.  I encourage anybody with an interest in WWII to read this book.

1444737090|4.0|I am a cat lover and owner of three cats, so I was drawn to this book first due to that. I recommend this book for animal lovers and non animal lovers alike.  This book really opened my eyes to the life of an addict, and struggles to securing work, staying clean and trying to just survive in life.  A person quickly realizes how smitten James becomes with Bob, and how much Bob means to him.  I truly believe in the benefits an animal brings to one's life, and that really shows through in this book.  This was an easy, quick read.  This book will find you cheering equally for both James and Bob.  And they both win, if you ask me!
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This is the Door 1967 debut album and probably there best. It's a dark, moody album, but that's not a bad thing at all. Soul Kitchen, Twentieth Century Fox, Light My Fire and The End are all stand outs... Excellent music, excellent band

B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really and good app.  I enjoyed the different levels.  I was not always successful, and that is good because if a game is too easy, it gets boring.  I never get bored with Tree of Life.  Hope you like it too.

B000F8O2OM|5.0|Stargate SG1 - the complete Season 2 - is fantastic.  The video quality is excellent, the characters and actors are outstanding, and the special effects and story lines are entertaining.  As others have said, you don't have to be a sci-fy fan to enjoy this season or all the series.<br /><br />If you enjoy good acting, great character interplay, and good story lines, you will enjoy this season 2 video set.  There are many and varied episodes and some will become your \\"fav's\\".<br /><br />Cannot rate this series highly enough.  Buy it (along with the other of the first 8 seasons) and watch them over and over and enjoy!

B001SKB1Y0|4.0|This is a very articulate film that is easy to watch and makes a plane ride go by a lot faster!  Is it Oscar worthy Citizen Kane-esque?  No, but it's entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.  This is mind candy for people with IQ's above room temperature.  A pleasant break from the dreary doldrums of the now ubiquitous genre of indie-misery movies, where the perception is that you can't be artistic without wallowing in a dark horrible chasm of life's lowest reaches - where the concept of being entertained and enjoying entertainment is somehow considered &#34;beneath&#34; people.  This is smart and entertaining - plus it makes a plane trip go a lot faster.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|The album is a great combination of great rock and excellent order. Lzzy Hale has one of the strongest voices in rock and has the equally talented band behind her to add to the experience.

B0094M4R3Q|5.0|My 5 yr old daughter really enjoyed watching this movie, I remembered it when I was younger and my mother played it constantly for my sister.

There are 2 movies on each SINGLE SIDED disc. Disc One has Tremors 1 & 2 and Disc Two has Tremors 3 & 4.<br />Hats of to Universal. They did it right!! YEA.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book was a lot less creepy than the cover pictures led me to think it would be.  I did like how the Jacob discovers that he is \\"peculiar\\" and what the home is really about.  In fact I was surprised that the story ended where it did as so much is unresolved in terms of the bigger story arc, but presumably that is what the next in the series will deal with.  In some ways it was almost to convenient that for each problem the characters face there was a child with a peculiar talent to solve it.  I hope that the characters will have to use both their wits and talents to save the day in the next book in the series.
0375869026|5.0|As I write this review, I note that of the 2,100 or so customers who have submitted reviews, some 85% give it five stars ( as do I ).  You should pay attention to those numbers.  This is an incredible book, so much more than a kid's book.  OK, full disclosure.  I'm 70 years old, and I really enjoyed the book.  Good from beginning to end, and a nice ending  it has. Unforgetable story.  I read quite a bit and from time to time I think why bother since many of the books kind of run together.  No danger of that with Wonder.  You won't forget Auggie or the story.  Unqualified recommendation as a great book for anyone regardless of his or her  age.
0385512104|4.0|I cannot add much to the other reviews. Christopher's journey was amazing, as the story is told from the perspective of the severely Autistic boy with such detail. His hyper-analytical mind worked to his advantage as he solved not only the mystery of who killed his neighbor's dog (which was his original mission) but he solved another mystery as well. You ache for him, since he cannot ache for himself; and you cheer for him for the same reason. A great story of persistence, hard work, anger, betrayal, and hope.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|Great positive uplifting song for teen girls.<br /><br />Helps teen girls to inspire them to be fighters, champions, and to express their voice for themselves.<br /><br />I use this song, as well as Perry's Fireworks,  when teaching teen girls how to improve their self-esteem.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009L4JLMO Self-Esteem: A Teen's Guide for Girls]]

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I really enjoyed this recent Trek film.<br /><br />There is some character development, but it seemed to me the producers/writers were pulling the same plot devices from the first reboot, thinly disguised as something new. I know a lot of Trek fans argument about every TOS/TMP and even TNG cliche crammed into this movie; not too mention the odious TWOK references. Overall it's an enjoyable ride, but that's not what my gripe is about...<br /><br />When I pre-ordered this DVD, I expected the extra feature we're going to be included on the DVD format. Instead, I got a barebones DVD with just the feature film, and a bunch of commercial and previews for crap I could care less about. The original price was $32 USD, then dropped to $29, then to $14 by CBS/Paramount. So if I want to see the extras, I have to buy the Blu-Ray/DVD combo, really?<br /><br />Why did the marketing eggheads decide to do this mid-stream is beyond me? Not all of us own a Blu-Ray player, so why would I have to buy a combo pack, spending money on a disk I can't even use? Marketing choices like this, are a turn off at best.
B00BT70IWS|4.0|I had great expectations of this album but its reality turned out to be something rather different. Having welcomed virtually every album from Jonas Kaufmann with a string of superlatives, I count myself a devoted fan of what is clearly the best tenor before the public today in a time of dearth - but I have to say that I do not think this is by any means the best he has yet given us. Ridiculously good-looking, prodigiously talented and hitherto eminently sensible in the management of his remarkable voice, Kaufmann has succumbed here to a predictably marketable project. Obviously he loves Verdi, but in many of the arias here, he has nothing special to add to their already immense discography. He simply hasn't the vocal lay-out of the Duke of Mantua or Adorno.<br /><br />He is at a stage in his career when the voice is big, dark and handsome but without the Italianate ping and elegance which characterises a true Verdi tenor. He is now evidently best suited to even heavier roles and would no longer essay the more refined, delicate arias such as Tamino's \\"Dies Bildnis\\" which he once included in his recitals in order to demonstrate how he still retained sweetness and flexibility. He still has all the notes and does some lovely things such as singing the concluding B flat of \\"Celeste Aida\\" in a proper pianissimo rather than belting it - although it is not exactly seamless or effortless. Far too many notes here are preceded by an incipient bleat or catch in tonal production which spoils and breaks his legato; this is an irritating habit which has come and gone during his career and it's a tic I wish he'd break. The essential sound is one approaching a consistent smokiness which is almost a hoarseness and which suits a coarser-grained Fach such as the lighter Wagnerian roles or the German-French Romantic repertoire but is not and never was the bella voce of mainstream Verdi. In heavier roles such as Don Carlos his musicality and virility of tone convince in the same way as Jon Vickers could carry it off; I have twice heard Kaufmann live in that role and admired his anguished intensity and amplitude but the more lirico-spinto roles no longer suit his timbre; there are half a dozen great tenors like Bergonzi, Pavarotti, Bonisolli and Carreras I would sooner hear sing that repertoire. However, for all that he is a compelling Carlos, I cannot imagine why anyone would prefer to listen to this \\"Don Carlo\\" duet over, for example, versions by such as Merrill and Bjorling, especially with the lumpy, unsteady Rodrigo we have here. In perhaps my favourite Verdi aria from \\"La forza del destino\\", he is darkly intense but he labours the point too much, especially when hampered by conductor Morandi's slack direction; the pulse of Verdi's line is lost. I do not for a moment impugn Kaufmann's artistry or acting ability but I feel that this recital is evidence of his having succumbed to commercial over aesthetic considerations: a Verdi recital is not playing to his strengths.<br /><br />Nor am I any longer sure that the choice of programme is wise: it is clearly geared towards the popular anthology of Verdi show-stoppers which Sony evidently hopes will sell but it's a very unimaginative selection and the inclusion of a supposed \\"bonus track\\" is sheer, cynical marketing-speak. Nowhere in this glossy, tri-lingual, handsomely illustrated production does it give the total length of the CD, but it is in fact a well-filled 69'30\\" - so how is the thirteenth aria a \\"bonus\\"? The term is meaningless. The Parma orchestra is distinctly squawky and second rate, and the comprimario singers and chorus are really poor - evidence of penny-pinching here. Are his producers beginning to take Kaufmann's audience for granted or cannot they tell the difference - or do they simply not care?<br /><br />Of greatest interest here are the \\"Otello\\" excerpts: the role represents the acme of any tenor who has the voice to sing it and Kaufmann has made no secret of his ambition to doso. On this showing, he is ready and should leave behind the early-middle-period stuff; his baritonal heft and command of the long line are ideal. I would kill to hear him sing the role live, otherwise little in this recital surpasses his previous achievements.<br /><br />There is so much that is good here that I am sorry to report that there is also too much of a whiff of naked opportunism about it for it to merit unqualified endorsement. Kaufmann's enormous gifts no longer necessarily lie in this kind of compilation. Roll on Tristan.so.

B00AZMFJYA|1.0|The movie was way too rushed and had all sorts of continuity/reality breakdowns. There are so many holes and unrealistic action/reactions by the characters that it could be used as a colander! I'll never get those 2hrs back.
B00D6QUMWG|5.0|I continue to be amazed by Ms Netrebko and in my view this is a wonderful album.  Her singing of Miserere from Il Travatore is really moving and the final piece on the album, also from Il Trovatore, Tu vedrai che amore in terra will blow your socks off !!<br /><br />the chorus and rolando villazon are also quite remarkable.<br /><br />I admit it.  I am a fan.
0316228583|4.0|Probably not for everyone (what is)? But I loved it! Maybe because I am an unapologetic Anglophile, but I loved the characters from depiction through interaction. JK is unfailing in her descriptions of English life & surroundings. But make no mistake Rowling fans, this is a major departure. This is a book for grown-ups. So if your stuck at Hogwarts, and can't imagine a writer stepping away from her usual output, steer clear!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|My only disappointment was when I beat the game and didn't have any new levels to play. It was amusing, challenging without being frustrating, perfect little &#34;one more level&#34; type of game to play in the evenings.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series - the movies, the books, the characters, all of it. Even to a point that I am considering a Harry Potter themed tattoo. This movie completes the series, and when I bought this, it was the only DVD I did not have. It wraps up the series wonderfully, and throughout the series, they followed the books quite well.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 8 year old LOVE this book he could not put it down read it in three days. I would highly recommend this book.
140006922X|5.0|I very much appreciated a historical perspective on the life and times of Jesus.  It gave me (and hopefully all readers) a fuller understanding of the political, social, and economic forces that actuated the people of that time, in particular how such a man as Jesus of Nazareth came to the forefront and under the notice of Jewish and Roman authorities.  I did not find that such an understanding undermined the biblical Jesus, but it certainly gave me new insight into the communities that created the Gospels as modern readers have encountered them.  Very well researched and annotated.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|This movie in my opinion was seriously over-rated. The special effects was average, the plot wasn't hidden, and Pitts performance was marginal at best. Having said that, get it at redbox or on demand. With the cost at the movie theater, this was a disappointment.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|I loved Boz Scaggs back in the 70's.  Never realized I was liking blues back then.  His voice is still great after all these years!  So glad he's still making great music!

1416955070|5.0|I am kicking myself that I waited so long to read City of Bones, the first in The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare.<br /><br />I picked up the first two books in a charity shop awhile back and left them sitting prettily on my bookshelf with all the other gorgeous books I can't ever seem to stop myself from buying. It was only when a friend of mine asked could she borrow the books before she went to see the film that I decided to get moving and start reading City of Bones. Of course, I still managed to see the movie first - it intrigued me enough (despite the cringe-worthy dialogue and bloody awful cheesy music played in the greenhouse scene) to go right home and open the first page. Anyway, if you haven't already guessed, I loved this book.<br /><br />Clary Fray is your typical fifteen year old. She loves to draw, hang out with her best buddy, the geeky and cute Simon, and bickers with her mom as most teenagers do. When she sees something she shouldn't in a nightclub, her world is turned upside down. Soon she learns that everything she's been told about her past is probably a lie and that she isn't the ordinary human girl she appears to be.<br /><br />The world the author created was intricate and fully developed, a secret universe of Shadowhunters - warrior humans with the blood of the Nephilim, and faeries, vampires and werewolves - the Downworlders. The New York landscape was vivid in its own right. Brooklyn, the East River, the streets were all clear in my mind. But then there were the buildings and places hidden from human eyes by glamours. The Gothic home of The Institute where Jace and his shadowhunter friends lived was beautiful and spooky. I adored the idea of such places being right under the noses of New Yorkers.<br /><br />The writing is some of the best I've read in the Young Adult paranormal genre of late. The setting was richly described, the characters well developed - the central ones at least. The banter and sarcasm between Clary and Simon, and even Jace had me snickering. Simon was the best boy friend that we'd all love to have. I felt bad for the guy though. He's been in love with the same girl for ten years, but she's attracted to the charismatic warrior Jace, who shines in all his blond glory and rune Markings.<br /><br />I'm almost finished the rest of the books. There will be 6 stories in total, the last not due for release until next year. How will I cope having to wait until then? These books are almost non-stop action, so fast-paced you have to take a breather and go make a cup of tea just so you can catch your breath. The buzz I get from these books reminds me of how I felt reading Twilight for the first time five years ago.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Really felt this is the movie from Steven Spielberg. The movie goes through exiting adventures and chases. Totally loved it.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|The movie examines lost souls trpped in twighlight realms, ominous worlds that parody our own, glimpses through time, and it starts with a man who wants to find a way through into another world, later we find him selling &#34;lucky watches&#34; to hookers going through a rough patch, if one wears one of these watches and burns a hole through a piece of folded over silk  and then looks through the hole strange things happen. A woman is acting in a movie but finds out its a remake of a polish film with a tragic history, it was never finished because the two leada were murdered, but when the world shifts because of the efforts of one magician looking for a doorway between worlds its hard to maintain a grip on where you are in time and who you are in time. Its strange what love does. Even fictional people are able to celebrate in the strange spaces between worlds when the evil magician who started the events is destroyed by our protagonist. David Lynch is at his very best all throughout this movie and the talented and wonderful cast delights and entertains all along.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This movie is bar far one of my top 5 favorite movies. It has a great message told in a dramatic way. If you want someone to really understand the pressures and troubles with drugs this is a movie to watch. Not for the queasy bunch as some scene are VERY graphic but if you can push through it I would recommend it to anyone. Instant classic that I could watch over and over again.

B00168OIOE|5.0|This movie is a classic. The animation in this movie is absolutely amazing and the characters are so life like. This movie I believe is good for all ages. I would watch this anytime which is why I purchased it. In blu-ray the animation is even more lifelike. The movements of each character are absolutely outstanding. This is a movie that in my mind is an instant classic!

B000V1Y43W|5.0|This movie is a TON of fun to watch. Great for all ages. Lots of cars made into cartoon characters which was fun to pick out all the different cars. This movie is a lot of fun to watch over and over. I would recommend it for anyone of all ages.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|If a kindle fire owner its a must have!  It's fun, epic and cheap! I can't  see any one not be willing to pay for this amazing product! Sorry that these are stupid sentences but my review must have 20 words.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|This movie was fun to watch. Has a good message however it was a little depressing right into the movie. It did get cheery as it went on but I wasn’t expecting it to be so sad right away. Overall I think it was a good movie and would watch over and over.
1609611543|5.0|This book it so amazing. It has really helped me understand better why I have felt the way I do so much of the time....and why we keep our big bellies! Even my husband has picked it up and within the first few pages it made so much sense to him. To think of giving up anything in the food line even for better health, usually he won't hear of it but.....he's beginning to consider the benefits of going wheatless. .
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have been enjoying hours of fun!!  This keeps me occupied while watching tv.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes to exercise their mind.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|Fairly long read but one never is bored with it because it is absolutely exciting and most of all the historical background really brings the book to life. I felt like I was the protagonist in the book and and just as it was exciting for the real protagonist to uncover all the mysteries, it was exciting for me as well. A brilliant book !
B009LHFYNG|5.0|Keeps being the best book for the teaching of Neuroscience. I also have the past editions and this was my first Kindle edition. Tools to highlight, make presentations, comments and everything from either my laptop, kindle device or phone are nice. One can keep preparing the lecture at the airport or anywhere.

0142420891|3.0|The sequel to bestseller \\"If I Stay\\" continues the saga and love story shared by Mia and Adam. Mia has gone off to Julliard to become the cellist she was meant to be, while Adams dreams come true and his rock band takes off to unexpected heights. Three years have passed and Mia and Adam have lost all contact while leading separate lives and following their dreams. But the past still haunts them both. The friendship and intimacy they shared cannot be forgotten and chances bring them together again in NYC. Adam has a delayed flight, Mia is performing at Carnegie Hall and their paths cross as the truth and the future lays out before them. This is a quick enjoyable read and great conclusion to If I Stay, which I adored. If characters tend to stay put in your mind long after the book ends, it is fun to read how things might have turned out.  If I Stay took the reader to unexpected places and Where She Went is much more predictable but I am glad I read them both! [[ASIN:0142420891 Where She Went]]
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Love it.  Only had device for 2 weeks, but it's been great so far.  My garage has no windows and is pitch black when entering through secondary door.  Been asking husband to install motion sensor light in garage for 7 years and it has obviously not been priority when garagedoor repairman mentioned the device.  Cheaper than installing windows in garage door.  It now automatically lights as I approach so I can finally see the stairs when going up staircase and keyhole to door without need to use another device such as iphone flashlight.  I am buying couple more for my inside stairwells to basement and 2nd floor so I can move around at night wo turning on any lights. 9.17.2013
0062255657|4.0|A fable set in Sussex England and a parallel world with delightful quirky characters. When a middle aged man returns to his childhood neighborhood for a funeral, he finds himself on a bench by the \\"ocean\\" down the lane. It is on this bench that his mind travels back to his childhood, back to when he was seven years old and his friend Lettie Hempstock saved his life and changed it forever. This Narnia-like magic world spliced so perfectly with reality that the reader must pay very close attention to these beautiful words and characters to follow along. Reflecting on ones own childhood, it is interesting to contemplate why we remember some very specific details from our lives and others not at all. As Old Mrs. Hempstock quotes in the story, \\"you'll never get any two people to remember the same thing.\\" I highly recommend this novel, it is both easy and unique in every way. I personally have not read many fantasy like stories and was extremely surprised how enjoyable this read was. [...]  [[ASIN:0062255657 The Ocean at the End of the Lane: A Novel]]
0132350882|5.0|I have a dirty little secret: the code I wrote last year was not as good as the code I am writing now. Why? Because I had not yet read Clean Code. This book explains *exactly* what makes code smell and how to fix it. I have followed its principles enthusiastically on my current project and have been very happy with the results. For example:<br /><br />* When I go back and look at my code months later, I know exactly what is going on. No head-scratching.<br />* When features change or get added, the code stays healthy.<br />* When we have to port to a new device, the code can gracefully handle the changes.<br />* If I see some smelly code that I wrote, I know exactly how to fix it.<br /><br />Reading this book will make you a better coder, I guarantee it. Highly recommended.

B00DAPOHU6|3.0|After the departure into electric rock ruminations of his late father on \\"To the Sea\\" (which is still a rather low-key, ambling affair), Jack Johnson returns to that simple, clean-sounding acoustic music that has for so long been his bread and butter.  Some of the sentiments expressed on the album are simplistic at best, but somehow Jack carries the tunes through by the strength of his charm and sincerity, even on these grade-school life observations.  He also shows he has some melodic chops, coming up with some of the best melodies of his career, which also help carry some of the weaker moments on the album.  He enlisted Beasties Boys producer Mario Caldato Jr, who previously worked with Jack on the 2005 \\"In Between Dreams\\".<br /><br />Expanding his song-template just enough (but still staying close to the his tried and true formula), he gets funky on \\"Radiate\\", pays homage to his punk days (!!!) as a teenager in \\"Tape Deck\\", and plays some more up-tempo, but still light (and light hearted) rockers such as \\"Washing Dishses\\" and \\"Shot Reverse Shot\\".  Elsewhere, he minds familiar territory with ballads and gentle music such as \\"Change\\" and a tribute to his wife, \\"I Got You\\".  He gets memorably strange on \\"\\"You Remind Me of You\\", a song about parenthood and children as clones of the parent, which doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Johnson has always been something of a sentimental optimist.  Like Paul McCartney with Wings before him, Jack never really gets edgy or even sounds like there has evern been anything seriously wrong in life.  When he does reach out lyrically beyond the realm of a \\"Happy Days\\" life, there is such a disconnect that he doesn't really have credibility.<br /><br />Even Jimmy Buffett (who is one of my favorites) escapes the stereotypical projection of him as an Island/Gulf swing musician and comes up with some great music that goes far beyond his party-hearty image that has so defined him throughout his career.  Jimmy knows that even for a surfer (especially for a surfer, actually), there are hurricanes a-brewin' out there.<br /><br />Perhaps he is just to idyllic for my tastes.  In the end, \\"From Here To Now To You\\" is standard Jack Johnson.  If you prefer the Paul Mcartney \\"silly love song\\" ethos over John Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono\\" era which represents deeply cathartic, highly persona confessional songwriting, then you will get a lot more enjoyment out of this record than I did.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Lennon's school of songwriting.
1250030951|5.0|I'm not a fangirl, I have never read or written fanfiction--yet I feel like Rainbow Rowell understands who I truly am. Rowell knows what being an introvert is like and she seaminglessly translate all of the awkwardness and beauty in Fangirl. Few authors can capture such raw and powerful feeling like Rowell can; Rainbow Rowell is definitely the Queen Of Contemporary Fic.<br /><br />Have you ever fallen in love with fiction? Have you ever felt more attached to fictional characters than acquaintances in real life? Have you ever read a book and had an unbearable urge to share your love with everyone you know? Would you rather live in fictional worlds than in reality? Do you like to escape from the world in fiction?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any of the above questions then Fangirl is the perfect book for you. You know who you are, be proud of your introverted nature! Some readers won't really understand Cath's decisions and actions, but most introverts will be able to relate to Cath.<br /><br />Cath would rather live in Simon Snow's fictional world rather than deal with her life in college. I completely understood the feelings of wanting to escape from life and immerse myself in fiction. I read to escape; when I read a book, I want to escape from reality and forget all of my problems. Cath needs Simon Snow to put off confronting her sister and dad, and her miserable (lack of a) social life. I have felt like this multiple times in life, whether it was in High School or at a different point in life, it doesn't matter. I know Cath, there is a large part of me that is still Cath, escaping reality online and in fiction. Cath is a character that is so rich and developed, there is just so much more to her than people see. After reading E&P, I discovered that Rowell writes the most intricate, realistic characters I've ever read and Fangirl is no exception.<br /><br />Some people are just going to dismiss Fangirl as a \\"chick-lit romance\\" but it's really more than meets the eye. Fangirl is a coming of age tale about coping with reality and balancing life. This may be shelved on Goodreads as \\"Chick-Lit\\" but I believe it can be enjoyed by both male and female readers alike. Cath's journey throughout her Freshman year of college is not one to be missed.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell has quickly become one of my favorite authors and she is quickly becoming a fan favorite on Goodreads. It's easy to see why Rowell is a popular author when you read Fangirl. Rowell's writing is simple, yet poignant and beautiful; every sentence seems to be crafted with power. There are no frivolous sentences in Rowell's books, every sentence, every word is essential in bringing about a larger panorama. The dialogue is filled with sweet and humorous moments that is not only realistic, but also well-written. I really love who Rowell includes unconventional characters; whether it be PoCs, introverts, or overweight characters. Rowell is bringing more diversity to the literary world and I think it's just what more books need.<br /><br />The romance in Fangirl is sweet, well written, and moves at a reasonable pace. Fangirls will definitely swoon over Levi and his relationship with Cath. The romance takes up a decent portion of the 2nd halfish of the book and was absolutely superb. I'm very picky when I read romance in novels but Rowell writes the exact kind of romance that I love. Fangirl has the kind of romance that gives you that warm, tingly butterfly feeling in your stomach, the kind that comes with first love. Reading Rowell's books will make readers fall in love all over again and rediscover who they are.<br /><br />Fangirl has captured my heart and I hope it continues to strike a chord with readers across the globe. This is definitely one of the best contemporary novels I have read and probably will ever read. Rainbow Rowell books hold a special place in my heart and on my bookshelf. Rowell understands her readers and it has never been more evident than in Fangirl, my love for this book is boundless.irl, my love for this book is boundless.
0307477401|4.0|In 1999, Henning Mankell published [[ASIN:1400095824 THE PYRAMID]], a collection of novellas and stories about the early career of his detective Kurt Wallander. He said then that he did not intend to write further Wallander mysteries, but he was prepared to go back. Well, he partially recanted in 2002, when he published [[ASIN:1400095816 BEFORE THE FROST]], which is as much about Wallander's daughter Linda, now a detective herself, as about her father. Then in 2009, he changed his mind again in this long novel that clearly marks the end of the series. This also features Linda, though in a new role, that of mother to Kurt's granddaughter. And in fact it is much more about the past than the present. Indeed, it might almost stand as a retrospective of the detective's entire career.<br /><br />This is very different from the classic Wallander mysteries, in that it is not centered around a recent crime in Southern Sweden, and Wallander spends most of the book on leave, away from the interplay with his colleagues that had been such a feature of the earlier novels. The subject this time is both personal and political. Personal because Wallander meets the parents of Linda's partner, and is invited to Stockholm for the seventy-fifth birthday party of her future father-in-law, Håkan von Enke. Håkan was a submarine commander in the Swedish navy and later a senior member of the naval staff. He was directly involved in the [real] Hårsfj&auml;rden incident in 1982, when a Soviet submarine was apparently cornered in inland Swedish waters, and then let go. He tells Wallander that he suspected treason in high places, and has spent the rest of his career trying to get to the bottom of it. A few days later, however, Håkan disappears, and Wallander is called in unofficially to assist. What follows is the tail end of a Cold War espionage mystery going back at least four decades. Despite at least one ensuing murder, I found it hard to engage very deeply in the spy story itself, and though the ending involves as unexpected a turn-around as any Mankell book, it also leaves a larger number of ends untied than the author would surely have allowed in a normal police procedural.<br /><br />But fortunately this is merely the framework on which Mankell hangs the novel that really interests him, which is the study of a man growing old. Although Wallander is only 60, he is subject to various physical failures and, most worrying, to short blackouts in which he loses all track of where he is and why. But meanwhile he takes delight in his granddaughter Klara, and the new warmth of his relationship with her mother. Not only does most of Wallander's investigation bring him into contact with people in retirement living mainly on their memories, but the entire novel seems to be a retrospective of all the significant memories from his own career. I recognized references to each of the stories in PYRAMID and I think to all the stand-alone novels. Some of these are merely passing mentions, others are quite moving in their own right, as for instance the reappearance of the woman with whom he had a passionate affair in [[ASIN:1400031524 THE DOGS OF RIGA]]. For Wallander fans, especially if they are more interested in the man than the detective, this last novel is a must-read. Others may find it rather heavy going.h the ending involves as unexpected a turn-around as any Mankell book, it also leaves a larger number of ends untied than the author would surely have allowed in a normal police procedural.<br /><br />But fortunately this is merely the framework on which Mankell hangs the novel that really interests him, which is the study of a man growing old.

1451695195|5.0|I waited to write a review after I ended the book to see if my thoughts were different from when I first finished the book.  However, I feel the same now as then in that Dr. Alexander seems very serious, very accurate, and very sincere about his near-death experience.  His interest in sharing the story seems genuine, and the resources he offers seem to extend his sharing of the belief that life exists after death.<br /><br />I don't believe that Dr. Alexander has any other motivation for relating his story except to extend the word that God is love and those whom we love will join together again in the afterlife.  It is convincing and well worth reading.  I thought it was an intelligent, thorough story.

The creators of the 2000 AD/Judge Dredd comics John Wagner and<br />Carlos Ezquerra were closely involved this film and the result is a great film for mature audiences.  The art direction and visual effects elevate this production out of B movie territory and the actor performances are solid.

0375507256|5.0|I'm so glad I took the time to finish this book before seeing the movie.  While I did enjoy the movie, I'm not sure I would have been able to follow all of the separate story lines and characters without first reading the book.  The book follows a &#34;nested&#34; structure to present a story-within-a-story-within-a-story-within-a-story-within-a-story-within-a-story.  So many times I was tempted to peek ahead and see how a story is resolved.  It all fits together so naturally.  I will absolutely pick it up and read it again.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast can turn a dumb TV into a limited capability smart TV for only $35. That's the good news. The not so good news is that you cannot (currently) &#34;cast&#34; local content from your PC or Android device even though the hype implies that you can.<br />  The device set up easily and performs well with the very limited default apps, and you can &#34;cast&#34; a tab from Chrome on your PC or laptop to your TV (NOT your android device) . Keep in mind that &#34;casting a tab&#34; from PC (or laptop) based Chrome does not include any of your local content (photo files, video files, music files, anything from your hard drive).<br />  That said, Google promises enhanced capability in the future as more apps become available, so time will tell. For the time being the device falls short of my expectations (my TV was already smart enough to stream Youtube, Netflix and others, and I certainly expected to be able cast from my Android smartphone).<br />  So read all the reviews, be careful of the hype, and do not set your expectations too high before you buy. This product is OK but not for everyone.

B00DIZS5GU|4.0|We have under Maestro Barenboim almost the best Verdi Requiem line up currently - Harteros, the best Verdian Soprano currently singing (even if not Italian), Kaufmann (the spinto tenor of choice of every opera house), Rene Pape (the hottest bass singer in Europe) and Elina Garanca (star mezzo-soprano).<br />It is wonderful experience to watch these great performers perform than merely listening to them, so this DVD release, even if the camera-work is not top-notch, ranks over the CD release.<br />It would have been infinitely better if the camera man would catch the soloists' interaction with the chorus and each other than focusing at so many moments on the conductor ALONE.<br />The chorus of La Scala has a superb history of singing this Verdian masterpiece, and they do it marvelously this time round.<br />Watching the four soloists, immediately one becomes aware that Garanca is not (yet) a Verdian singer. Not only does the voice find difficulty riding the orchestra and chorus, but even in duets or soloists' ensembles, the mezzo-soprano voice 'caved in' in the wake of Pape's sonorous bass, Kaufmann's incisive tenor and Harteros's highly flexible lirico-spinto soprano. One would have thought that Daniela Barcellona would have done better here.<br />Personal problems have robbed much colour from Anja Harteros's heart-shaped face, but luckily not her vocal lustre. This current Verdian soprano of choice gives perhaps the most affecting performance here, shining above Kaufmann and Pape's otherwise impeccably moving performances.<br />One cannot wish for an all-Italian Verdi Requiem with Cecilia Bartoli, Andrea Bocelli (under Gergiev already), Ildebrando D'Arcangelo (under Gergiev) and Carmen Giannatassio, so this non-Italian line up is about the best one can get currently, am afraid.<br />So, despite the less than perfect shooting, still a front-ranking item of this repertoire.<br />Despite the superb vocal cast, the camera work is clumsy, and the sound isn't pristine.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Every bit as good as the book. No one is slaughtered or raped and then murdered - they just live their tiny, quiet lives full of passion and curiosity and wonder.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|As movies go this is pretty ho hum standard  summer action stuff. Non-stop for two solid hours but despite that or maybe because of it, the movie never really thrills or excites.  Yep it is fun at times, nice special effects the acting is okay the script....well it is lets just leave it at not very good.  As far as working as a Trek movie not at all. It does have a few genuine Trek moments in it but not many.  Yes I understand it is a reboot.  I even had high hopes for this one as the first movie opened up some real possibilities.  This movie squandered the opportunity to do something special in favour of pandering to the simplest of movie patrons.  Worth a look if you are not Trek fan just for the pretty colours.  If you are a Star Trek fan still worth a look,  BUT be warned!  You will find yourself cringing a few times as you watch this.

1781162646|5.0|Stephen is definitely \\"there\\" in every line - but a pulp fiction murder mystery complete with ghosts let's the reader know immediately that this particular ride is bumpier in a different sort of way than the usual King novel.  Characters are perfect, surprises await and abound, and even though you are ready for the final chapter you won't want it to end. So, constant readers, strap yourselves in tightly and enjoy the trip through Joyland!l

B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved the way this story ebbed and flowed between the lives of two women...could not put it down. This was a previously unknown (to me) portion of our American History...maybe I wasn't paying attention at the time or maybe enough time wasn't allowed for the stories of these children.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading!
1439156816|5.0|Honest and straightforward, playful and substantive. Definitely adding this book to my library on writing.  Stephen's approach is intimate and motivational, no-nonsense yet tender.  Thank you!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|The drugged featured in the movie slowed down things so you got to see violence in slow motion just some violence porn.
B00EL6AAEU|4.0|I eagerly awaited the release of Blackfish after having read the book \\"Death at Seaworld\\".  I was hoping that the movie would be as riveting as the book, but it wasn't.  Maybe it was because the book was so good, and Blackfish didn't go into the same level of depth as the book (although I don't think it could have).  Maybe because you didn't hear from scientist Naomi Rose in Blackfish and she was such a vital part of the book.  Whatever the reason, Blackfish falls just a little but short, although I think that the movie and book complement each other nicely.<br /><br />The movie is striking in several ways:<br /><br />1. How it shows the small tank that the whales were kept in on 'off hours' (barely enough for them to turn around in)<br />2. Its use of news footage combined with interviews to tell the story<br />3. How it portrayed the devastating death of Dawn Brancheau, the trainer who most recently was killed by the killer whale<br /><br />After seeing Blackfish, one wonders how all the trainers interviewed actually worked there, given what was happening.  Several of them seemed quite oblivious and took SeaWorld's word for what was going on with the whales, rather than investigating what was known about the whales as they lived in the wild.  It is gratifying to see how so many of them realized what was happening and left SeaWorld, but one also wonders how anyone could still work there given what we know about these amazing creatures.  It would seem that money and ignorance plays a large part in those trainers that still work at SeaWorld.<br /><br />The other interesting (and in some way unexplainable) thing about Blackfish is how little the family of Dawn Brancheau appears in the movie and how non-chalant they are, particularly at the end.  I believe it is her sister at the end who talks about how the family will be celebrating her life, etc, and she (or any other members of her family) say nothing against the organization that led to the death of Dawn.  Both my wife and I were astonished that we didn't hear more anger or disdain about what happened.  As far as we were concerned, SeaWorld should rename one of its parks after Dawn Brancheau.<br /><br />After watching Blackfish, and reading \\"Death at SeaWorld\\", you can only come to one conclusion - killer whales do not belong in any form of captivity whatsoever.  To continue to use and exploit these intelligent animals is tantamount to kidnapping and torture.  Unfortunately, and the movie alludes to this, money trumps morals in this instance, so because killer whales make money, they will probably always be showcased as they are.<br /><br />As for me, though, neither I nor my family will ever take part in one of the Shamu shows, and I hope that others follow suit.  If Blackfish turns just one person against Sea World's atrocities, it will have been a success.wife and I were astonished that we didn't hear more anger or disdain about what happened.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and very addictive. I love playing this game a great way to spend some free time
B003JUGQ38|4.0|My four stars are for David Tennant. I don't really like Catherine Tate, so I left off a star. Great season, though, except for the episode that was all Donna. That was a lame episode, but necessary for the story, I guess. On to season 5 and a new doctor...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I haven't fineshd it yet hut so far AMAZING also read Under The Forever Sky it is also amazing bye😃
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really like the game. Challenging. A game you have to pay attention to. Helps exercise your mind. Enjoy it very much.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|This watch is really confortable for the arm. Also is beautiful. I'm happy with my new toy. Works perfect. Excellent
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased this because I thought it would be a way to expand my TV options as I had cancelled my DirecTV service.  Unfortunately, I had hoped that Amazon Prime free streaming videos would be able to be shown on my TV.  The only way that works is to disable the silverlight plugin.. then you experience a lot of latency issues between dialogue and video.  So it doesn't work for that.<br /><br />It was also not quite as simple to set up as advertised.  I tried it three different days (quitting when I got frustrated).. before I actually achieved success.<br /><br />Not sure why I wouldn't just want to use an hdmi cable from my laptop to be honest.  Maybe if I keep using it.. and apps get upgraded.. it will have more utility?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I can't get enough of this amazing app .I can say it's so much fun for the hole family. we all play and help each other out .my kids are even starting to get alone better .I would recommend it to everyone
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Can actually watch it with the kids over and over. Very well done. Sound and rendering great, plot is solid. Great in Blu Ray.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|I received an e-copy of the book from the author in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I'm not sure I've ever willingly read historical fiction, so was shocked at how much I enjoyed this book. I soon found myself completely immersed in the story, the history and how the war was affecting each character. Incredibly well written, it was obvious the author had thoroughly researched the subject and the emotions of the story were easy to see throughout. I knew how the war had affected where I live, and had heard many stories from my grandparents, but seeing a completely different view was definitely an eye opener.Sadly, like all of life there is much sorrow and loss, reality, but there is also survival and hope. I will not forget this read for a while to come.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I love Angry Birds, and I especially love the Star Wars edition, but I've experienced a lot of frustration with it over the last few days. When the Cloud City level updated awhile back, it would force close the app if I clicked on it. Since I'm usually passive, I left it alone. Then another recent update gave me the Moon of Endor level and I was thrilled, but Cloud City still had an issue. I contacted Amazon and somehow it got fixed without any further assistance on my part. I could access both without problem, and that made me one happy geek! Then another update popped up on my Kindle, and I okayed it without fear.<br /><br />Big mistake. BIG mistake. From that moment, the app force closed on me before the intro music even stopped playing! This time, when I contacted customer service, their recommendations led to me uninstalling the app, which I did uneasily, and reinstalling it. I can get into the app now, but all of my progress is gone! AND the Moon of Endor level is missing as well.<br /><br />I love this app, but this experience has been very frustrating. I hope that this improves in the future.
B001GQ3DXS|2.0|Sorry to say, but this JAFF just didn't come near the punch of the original.  No thoughts expressed here that fans probably haven't heard in their inner ear while reading the original.  Generally, I enjoy Ms Grange's efforts but this one fell flat for me.
B00005JLF5|1.0|The case was falling apart within the first 5 uses, and a third of the episodes don't even play.  I wish I could get another one without defect, especially since it was a present for my husband's birthday...
B0000C1733|5.0|This was the best thing I bought on Amazon. I am so glad I got it. The Cd plays wonderfully. It really is most of their best songs ever played.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|This is definitely better than the 3-stars it currently has on Amazon. Sure, it could have been better, but the fact that Pacino and DeNiro are doing a movie together again will automatically give anything 3 stars, and the story wasn't bad at all. I'd say 3.5-4 stars, but could have easily been 5 if they had a better story to go with this awesome duo.
B0079XNWQA|4.0|This cd was great. It came in great condition as said. The cd plays greatly and the music is great.
0783233477|3.0|Not a good movie, not a bad movie. Pretty slow and plodding, but when people watch love stories such as this one, they rarely care as long as the \\"tear\\" factor is high. I liked the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani, and the story was really good, but in the end the pace was too slow.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I found the book somewhat difficult to read because the author jumps back and forth in time.  The information in the book is very interesting.  I can't comment on its veracity, as I'm not a biblical scholar or historian.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|This is easily one of the best films of ALL time. 5 stars all day. Acting/actors are great, story is great, action is great, writing is great, the chemistry and contrast between characters is great. Anyone that puts 1 star is just a fa@@ot.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|love the game sometimes a challenge sometimes not but always fun. its a great way to relax after work. my husband and I compete against each other.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great for the whole family.  A family movie that the is enjoyable for everyone.  A must see and highly recommended.
B00B7803HO|4.0|this episode was especially moving.  and, in another review, I objected to some of the silliness and occasional incongruities of plot and script (\\"learning curve,\\" an expression used in this episode, is not an expression that one would have heard in England in 1920).  but, the acting is consistently marvelous and the direction is always interesting.  then again, the character of Cora's mother was artlessly constructed to be a repellent cartoon figure, crass, impolite, and devoid of any redeeming traits. a gentle or not so gentle point about the differences between the American nouveaux riches or Americans generally and the English nobility which had been made more delicately would have been more effective and more credible.
B000GT7XXW|5.0|Excellent!  Finally, a production of Hamlet that I can understand and enjoy.  Branagh has assembled an incredible cast for international actors that really brings this gorgeous production onto a human level.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great it is fun for all ages and you get to be competitive on face book with your friends and its free iv had no problems with it personally and I regimens everyone play it
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|It freezes way to much. Takes forever to get the token s to play the game. You can only add people if they are playing threw facebook.  There are way to many ads and they are all long.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really liked this game there was a lot to it and i can't wait to play the second game.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|My son absolutely loves dragons and dinosaurs. When I saw this one, I knew he would love it and he did. It is made of very heavy material that my 5-yr-old isn't going to destroy any time soon. He has spent hours playing with it and still loves it. The only issue that I have with it is that the ball jointed wings have a tendency to pop off with very little effort. That's somewhat disappointing in a $50 toy. When it is shipped the wings are intentionally left unattached and have to be put in as well. The rider also doesn't fit perfectly, but will stay on the dragon with some effort and the occasional rubber band. As for educational value, I suppose if there were actual dragons for him to learn about or he was aspiring to be a knight, it may have some. Other than that, I don't see any. But toys are toys and are made for fun, not always for learning. Kids learn through play, and this is a great tool for that!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Where's part 3!!!!! This book was so good I love love love love loved it. Can't wait any longer for the next one
B008OOYALE|2.0|I loved this game. I have spent buttloads of money to enhance my experience.<br />But I have to play it on my Kindle which does NOT let me  breed half the dragons available.  I also  can't buy and use the Workshop.<br /><br />There ate lots of habitats and dragons I would happily give my money to Team Lava for. My eyesight is poor and I have to use my Kindle to play.<br /><br />If I had known how little of the game I would be able to access I would have NOT bought this game. I have given them around $1,000.<br /><br />BEWARE KINDLE USERS!<br /><br />Also ANDROID USERS Cannot access much of the game as well.<br /><br />BEWARE ANDROID USERS!
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|Ordered this for a 24 fan. He was very excited to receive this and is glued to the tv at this moment watching it!
0345347951|3.0|Starts with a really interesting premise. Aliens have essentially taken over the world and forced humans to end war and poverty etc. They don't reveal themselves to humans and many are afraid they might have secret sinister motives. Lots of speculation over what they could be and what they intend.<br /><br />I thought the book was going to be about politics and the future. Humanity's potential, how we could end war and suffering, what society could become, the aliens helping humanity to realize a higher level of existence etc. Sounds like that in the beginning. But halfway through the book the plot devolves into a bunch of bs about psychic powers. No more science fiction or politics, it's all about magic. Not only does it play out in a kind of corny way, it's uninteresting because it doesn't mean anything. Doesn't speak to the real world today. Clark says in the intro that he used to take a lot of supernatural stuff seriously, doesn't anymore, but the book is still good because hey, whatever, its fiction. That's nice for him, but it take's a lot of the meaning out of the story. In the past he must have meant for the supernatural aspects of the story to be taken seriously, an imagining of what humanity really would become as it realized hidden physic potential. I'm sure most of you reading don't believe in physic garbage, so you won't find it compelling. Disappointing but alright story.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I'm not a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, however I'm a big Clarence Clemons fan. The Big Man is what makes the Band click. The Wings for Wheels DVD is great. The DVD makes this set so good. The DVD is a documentary about the making of Born to Run Album and how they almost broke up, if the Born to Run Album was a failure. After the Big Man joined the Band, the E Street Band took off. Amazon's Customer Service is great too, the DVD was missing and they gave me an exchange without any problems.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Ending to the series is abysmal, but that's in part because the rest of the show is so good. People call it sci-fi but it's really just a drama that happens to be set in space. Production values and acting very high quality, most episodes feel like movie quality. Doesn't fall into the sci-fi trap of having a \\"planet of the week\\" episodic content structure or whatever, doesn't feel like a soap opera like a lot of American TV where nothing much changes from season to season. Characters die, they develop, and they deal with ethical issues directly relevant to the real world and in particular American politics and society. A must watch. Just brace yourself for the disappointing 4th season and conclusion.<br /><br />Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, make sure you get the right version of the box set, as amazon lists a few under the same page. The one in the picture, with the silver box, is the one you want.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy this game. It is fun and a different concept for me. I have become interested in trying to breed the different dragons.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|I love the visuals and the M83 music. I dislike that monstrous plot holes and wooden acting. Anyone could have played Morgan Freeman's or Jaime Lannister's role. Tom Cruise plays... well Tom Cruise. Andrea Riseborough was excellent.<br /><br />RENT OR BUY USED... DO NOT BUY FULL PRICE.<br /><br />????
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is awesome. I highly recommend this app because of what it can do. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO THINK IT IS DUMB. You should seriously get this app
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very challenging which is what I was looking for. Variety of puzzles. I get frustrated a Ted at times because of the timer but it's been the best game I've found.
0385528787|5.0|Someone has written that this isn't Atwood's best book.  I purposely re-read the two preceding books before reading this one.  There is a lot of new ground covered here filling in some of the lives of characters prior to the 'flood'.  The main themes of the trilogy: class divisions, environmental degradation, corporate crime, the necessity to understand and work with the 'bioforms' around us, continue. Above all, there is an optimism that pervades the work and Atwood's sense of humor is ever present.  The three books really from a whole.  They make one think critically about the world we live in.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|The only downside is the pool stick is really sensitive..other than that it's been a great game. Good times!! Can be addictive!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love this show. Hands down, best entertainment value right here. DVD arrived on time as promised one it was available for shipping. (I had pre-ordered this back in May ~ worth the wait!) NO quality or shipping issues....YEAH!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love Pinterest and the app makes it easy to use. To quickly repin something, just press and hold the original pin. The think I don't like though is it will unexpectedly close. This app does have a little glitch and will force close in the middle of pinning or scrolling through which is inconvenient. You have to re open/start the app and hope you find the pin you were looking at again. But overall, great way to find recipes,  crafts, and plenty of ideas.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Jay Gatsby.  The movie was over-the-top, but wasn't that what Fitzgerald described Gatsby as?  Loved the costume design, music and that car!!!
B007N8RULO|3.0|THE GAME IS NOT CHALLENGING.  MAY BE OK FOR BEGINNERS. IF YOU ARE WINNING MORE THAN 75% OF THE TIME ITS TIME TO MOVE AHEAD TO ANOTHER LEVEL OR GAME.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Similar in concept to Angry Birds Siege Hero is a nice, easy-to-learn game. I have it on my Kindle Fire and it works great.
B000FC13E0|5.0|Read this book for a Nanotechnology college course. Although the idea seems far fetched, with the advances in technology, we may see versions of this within the next 20+ years or sooner.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|This is my first Oscar Wilde book and it's rather difficult to absorb. I like to read books that take place back in the 19th & early 20th centuries by classic authors, such as Verne, Wells, Lovecraft, etc. My taste in novels tend to be in the action or science fiction genres rather than romantic fiction. Perhaps back then gentlemen really had conversations like the men do in 'Dorian Gray'.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|if you like to see a lot of action and a lot of cars blown up this is the one for you.<br />Not bad, not great, but if you are not performing brain surgery on the weekend- watch it.<br />It has its good moments.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I use this with my iPod for better sound quality through earbuds or through an external amp (via the amp's auxiliary). The sound is excellent. I don't seem to have a lot of battery life - less than 8 hours when used constantly. The power/volume knob is a little difficult to access when the iPod is strapped to the amp with the included rubber straps. I use the &#34;FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone&#34; to connect the amp to the iPod.
B002MG2RG0|3.0|If you like old movies this is one you need to see. No graphic violence, but when it aired way back then, it was scary. Renfield has a great part and a great laugh.<br />Enjoy
B00136JS12|5.0|Almost every song is a winner here. The lyrics might be a little bit dated, yeah, but the songs still rock.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great App !  I also love the audio . There are many available versions and great fonts to choose from along with easy navigation .
1939416019|1.0|The only reason I gave one star is because you can't give zero.<br /><br />This is honestly the silliest book I have ever read. The interaction between the characters sounds like it was written by a 12 year old. Everything that happens seems to be \\"bigger\\" and \\"better\\" than you can imagine.  The events unfold so quickly on a timeline (within days), the main character goes from sheep herder to the chosesn squire of an epic hero and he gets a pet falcon (with whom he shares a \\"mystical bond\\") and a pet \\"unbelievably rare\\" leopard cub. Oh, and the king's beautiful daughter likes him and he's destined to be the most powerful mage and king EVER. I can't believe that anyone thought this book was good. People must not read very much anymore...
B000OVLINI|5.0|Loved the way author gave background info about each character and<br />how their lives evolved. My favorite character was Fermin.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I got this sharpener because of the overall good ratings on this site. However when it arrived the metal pieces began to immediately fall at and were not all at securely kept inside the device. This is not utterly useless for me to use and I cannot sharpen anything.<br /><br />Do not fall for the false reviews! DO NOT BUY this item, it has a poor make.
B00ECU4DPW|5.0|I chose this rating because the movie felt similar to the first episode. In this movie, Twilight Sparkle had to make friends all over again in another dimension, while trying to stop Sunset Shimmer from driving everyone apart. I enjoyed it!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The app works pretty well. I bought for my new tablet and I'm very satisfied. All of the books I bought from my old tablet were downloaded to the new one.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is by far the funniest show I've watched for years.  However, not everyone is going to like it.  Just because I love it doesn't mean the next person will.  We each have our own tastes in humor, and there's nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />Also, most of my co-workers are big fans.  We've already identified our office \\"Penny, Amy, Leonard and Sheldon.\\"  In case you wonder, I am almost 60 years old, and some of my co-workers are half my age.  I guess really great humor works with a variety of age groups.
B0046W1692|5.0|This album was a breath of fresh air.  After being disappointed with Manas 2 latest albums(rda and aec) I didnt really know what to expect  but as soon as I heard \\"Lluvia al corazon\\" I knew they were back to where they once were.<br /><br />This album like some other reviewers have pointed out have a great alternative rock feel about it which I love.  The sound is superb and the singing is terrific.  Just hear \\"Latinoamerica\\" and \\"el espejo\\" and you know that Fher is back with his amazing voice and emotional singing.<br /><br />You also have Manas typicially fun rock songs such as \\"Mi reina del dolor\\"<br /><br />Although Ive always prefered Manas heavier songs, one ballad here really touched me and that is \\"Vuela libre Paloma\\" which I am sure most Mana fans know what is about.<br /><br />I recommend this album for any Mana fans but especially for those who loved \\"Suenos Liquidos\\" and \\"Cuando los angeles lloran\\".  To me this is their 3d best album.

B00D2I8E46|5.0|For this long time fan, Costello's aim has been more haphazard than true since he ditched The Attractions. There are exemptions in Brutal Youth (featuring The Attractions) and an underrated When I Was Cruel. But since Spike have felt him as inconsistent, overwrought, self-conscious as he's been intermittently brilliant. Sometimes, all you need is a right hook and a punch line you can feel. As for his collaborations, from Bacharach to Otter to Toussaint---they've all been eye rollers in my book.<br /><br />That said, it sounds like Costello has finally wised up. Ghost is his most straightforward, least contrived in decades. One would think a pairing with the Roots and their brand of eclectic Hip Hop and Funk would be an awkward one. But if anything, they live up to their moniker by keeping things grounded. The Roots provide an eerie, hypnotic Funk to the proceedings. At times reminiscent of early Beck. Which really doesn't do them justice as they're hardly imitators. Its more sinister cocktail music and laid back Funk than Hip Hop. Despite, his usual brand of vitriol, Costello sounds much more at home and playful here than in the other musical hats he's doffed and juggled.  Everybody hates a tourist but as Get Happy proved, R & B and Soul suit Costello far more than any forays south of the Mason Dixon line.<br /><br />Vocally, this is his most restrained in years.  But that restraint doesn't come at the expense of edge. I always felt Costello's lower register was eerily effective on classics like I Want You, Beyond Belief and Almost Blue. Mercifully he's left the cringe inducing Broadway belting at the door. And even if he lacks his usual caustic hectoring, don't expect the crooning claustrophobia of North. This is a far more moody, dark and varied affair.<br /><br />Seasoned devotees will pick up snippets of Pills & Soap along with strains of Hurry Down Doomsday on Stick Out Your Tongue. Here's Costello and The Roots organically \\"sampling\\" from his back catalog. And it works. There are also a lot of Musical \\"in\\" jokes. You can tell ?uestlove is a genuine fan. The opening of Tripwire is from Spike's Satellite. There's a mix of Radio Silence and High Fidelity in the bonus track, Can You Hear Me. (She Might Be A) Grenade is a reworking of Delivery Man bonus track, She's Pulling Out The Pin. Lyrically, things typically veer between the outraged and the arcane. But in terms of the delivery and backing the collage approach on Ghost is refreshingly unpretentious.<br /><br />While I found a lot to like off National Ransom, it lacked cohesion. Here, all the eclectic elements including the Deluxe bonus tracks come together to make this Costello's strongest cuff on the ear since the turn of the century.it works.

0307271609|5.0|When I was teaching in Singapore, the history syllabus covered the reign of the Empress Dowager Cixi, or Tzu- Hsi, as she was also known. I find her to be a complex and incredibly intelligent woman who bucked the restrictions imposed upon her gender during a period where females were extremely oppressed to rise through the ranks and become one of the most powerful women in China's history. Though Cixi has been reviled by many as a despot, author Jung Chang, who also wrote the amazing [[ASIN:0743246985 Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China]], provides a starkly different perspective, one that shines the spotlight on the Empress Dowager's many achievements.<br /><br />The book also provides the reader with a compelling look into the politics of governing China during the period. As one of Emperor Xianfeng's many royal concubines, Cixi distinguished herself not only because she provided the emperor with a son, but was also known for her political acumen, and this proved helpful when the Emperor died five years later. Employing cunning strategies, Cixi positioned herself as the real ruler of China, with her son installed as the Emperor Tongzhi.<br /><br />Using recently accessible historical documents, primarily in Chinese, the author paints a compelling portrait of a woman who went against the grain and helped propel China into the modern era with significant strides being made in diverse fields such as economy, military, education, etc. One of the significant social reforms, at least in my opinion, was the banning of the cruel and antiquated practice of female foot-binding which saw many young women crippled way before their time, and prevented women from being more productive participants in society.<br /><br />I admit that it was difficult to reconcile the dominant view of the Empress Dowager as a cruel, ultra conservative with this reformist Empress, but Jung Chang makes a compelling case and backs up her work with historical evidence. I'm no historian, but I found this book to be well-written and cogent, and think it will appeal to those who are interested in Chinese history and politics.this book to be well-written and cogent, and think it will appeal to those who are interested in Chinese history and politics.

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Best game I ever played and the graphics are so realistic, I recommend this app for anyone who is interested in racing games
B00AKHWG6Y|5.0|This album is a must have, extraordinary and haunting. The production is excellent. Worth every penny. Modern Prog Rock at its best.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Lots of great actors in this movie. Comedy and action filled keeps you thinking on w hats next. Could watch it over and over.
B00F0XCL4K|5.0|Just bought the mp3 download but musically this is perfect.  The best group ever at the top of their game.  Have the entire Band catalog, this is worth what I paid for it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Able to continue with my book club selection wherever I am.<br />I am very glad I decided to try it!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is one of the best books that I have ever read in my life. I would recommend this book to everyone
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Nothing but issues, couldn't get it to reliably work, so I'll be returning this complete waste of my time. I have a nice Cisco router within plenty of range of this device and I get connection issue errors left and right. This product isn't ready for primetime.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A dark, clever tale that never gives itself away.  Almost as hard to pick up as to put down.  I call that a success.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It's a slow read and both puzzling in some areas and implausible in others. I finished it in a day Oreo, and it wasn't satisfying. Just so-so. It will remind you of The Firm once you've finished reading it.
030789701X|5.0|For all the additional features digital documents have these days, sitting in your lap while playing a game is not one of them.  The only problem is that this game has so many mods available, no book could possibly keep up with all the unofficial content.  But this certainly has all the data to plan your characters' development, and it looks nice on a coffee table, a desk, or a bookshelf.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My family purchased this a while back and we play it religiously.  When I went off to college at the Naval Academy, I could think of no better gift for my sponsor family/host family than this gift.  Hope to get many more great hours out of this game.
B0016OOS16|4.0|This is a great little device and really lets me get around solidworks with ease.<br /><br />The setup was extremely easy and the settings have a lot a useful customizations. I especially like the ability to reverse/swap the directions, since I like zooming by pulling out and pushing in on the puck. I've set left button to bring up the mouse settings, so tweaking things was quick.<br /><br />My one complaint is that my puck doesn't always center itself. About 10% of the time it will continue to spin when I let go. BUT Amazon is really great about replacements and I'll have a new one in 2 days! Thanks Amazon.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This movie has it all! action was great- loved the old characters!! They did a great job casting these parts!
0552560359|5.0|My 4 and nearly 2-year old both love this book.  I'm amazed at how my youngest picks up on the concept and has fun \\"choosing\\" for everyone in our family. Fun, creative, a discussion starter, and overall great book. Good one for kids to entertain themselves with, too, once they have read it with parents a few times.  I'm now hunting for similar books to add to our library.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Everything from The Oatemeal is worth my money. I wish I had bought it as a hardcover so I could leave it on a coffee table.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great perspective on race in the socialite south during segregation.  The strength of the black women who come forward to tell the truth about what their lives as servants to the socialites is like is powerful.  The characters and their various ways of surviving is varied--from sad, to silent strength, to sneaky rebellion, to freedom.  I laughed, cried, and was riveted throughout the well-told story.  Very good movie.

B00CT5NDHQ|5.0|An employee of the publishing house Kay Norris moved to a new apartment in the trendy skyscraper, called the &#34;rake&#34;. There she becomes the object of rivalry between the two men - the owner of the house and one of the tenants, the author of the popular detectives.<br /><br />A series of mysterious murders taking place in the house, leads her to believe that she herself is compressed around a dangerous ring. Kay realizes that the unknown killer - one of her fans ......
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|I had never heard about Carcass until I saw the Heartwork video on Headbanger's Ball back in the day but I immediately purchased the album Heartwork and its predecessors.  When Swansong came out I wasn't disappointed, as the more pretentious hardcore fans were, because I was just thrilled to hear more Carcass music and, while it was different, I thought it was still better than most of the other music out at the time.<br /><br />Surgical Steel is the album all Carcass fans have waited for.  There is a return to the themes of their first few albums, both in subject matter and use of their thesaurus, as well as sharp riffs, blasting drums, and alternating vocals of Necroticism and Heartwork.  My first reaction was that this is the album Carcass could have produced after Necroticism using the production of Heartwork.  But there's so much more to it than that.<br /><br />I won't make this a long review.  It doesn't need to be.  If you love hardcore music, regardless of genre or sub-genre name, and aren't one of the aforementioned people who think Carcass was only good when the production value was low and you could barely differentiate one riff or vocal from another, then you will enjoy this album very much.<br /><br />Surgical Steel hasn't left my CD player since I got it.
0143034901|5.0|This is a really engaging, thought provoking, well written book. The characters are deep and well constructed.<br />The plot keeps you interested and entertained throughout.<br />I read it on holidays and throughly enjoyed it.

B00CKR63F2|5.0|A normal yearly gathering of Oria's people turns out to be something quite different from what she expected, when she ends up behind the Bridalveil Falls. She, and four others, become new Dwellers in the land of Ahwahnee, since they reached their eighteenth birthday.<br /><br />All her life unusual things have been happening, which are now starting to make sense to her.<br /><br />  \\"You have always been exceptional. You just never considered yourself<br />  special. Your gifts were dormant until you turned eighteen.\\"<br /><br />The first sign that things are amiss is the disappearance of Dwellers. Apparently, not everyone is who they appear to be... Oria is discovering her true calling as the Golden Queen fairy of Bridalveil Fall. She has a lot of growing to do in order to fulfill her mission - to destroy the Ala.<br /><br />  \\"You have to find compassion and embrace the darkness inside of you, in order<br />  to understand it, and ultimately, to transcend it.\\"<br /><br />Will Oria be able to rise above herself and find the courage and compassion needed to fulfill her destiny?<br /><br />And what about the mysterious Grey Wolf? Who is he really? And what is his mission? Apart from breaking Oria's heart at his disappearance...<br /><br />I love that this fantasy world is actually located at a real place. The author is great at world building and describing the character growth of the personages in the book. It's a coming of age story about discovering who you really are and what abilities, talents and competencies one has - and maybe even more importantly - how you can use them for good. The cliff hanger at the end really pulls me in to read the second installment in this series!
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I liked the better language and milder action in this movie.  I would gladly watch it again.  I am not so fond of gore and fowl language in a lot of the movies coming out these days.
B0084670FU|3.0|The movie was okay, and the only issue was that I couldn't put subtitles or change to another language. other then that interesting movie.

B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Paid to view in HD on my roku box. I have excellent signal strength. My roku box is no more than 15 ft from my WiFi. Yet still I cannot get better than two dots on my download during this movie. I couldn't even finish it. It was such a terrible picture quality. The movie might be great but I think Amazon has major problems. I have noticed this is becoming more of the norm and less of the exception with Amazon Prime.

B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I was hooked on Bastille ever since I found them via Emerge on Spotify. I really enjoy the pace of songs and general flow of the album.<br /><br />This is a good up and coming band with songs which to me are very catchy and easy to get hooked on. I can't quite put my finger on my I really, really like this band but there is something of substance there. I just wished I would have sprung for concert tickets locally because by the time I realized they were coming to town (Portland, OR), all of the tickets were sold out. I look forward to seeing what comes from this band in the future and hope they make another tour so that I might be able to catch them live.

B004Y1WCDE|4.0|I recently set up a Plex Media server and noticed an application which I can use on my tablet. The interface is great and I have had no issues streaming media. Easy to navigate and similar to the feel of my roku box.<br /><br />Does what is advertised, what more can I really say.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|the chromecast app installed nicely on my Nexus 7, not so much on my Win7 laptop.  I set it up with the tablet and cast a couple youtube videos to my TV.  I still can't get my laptop to work with it.  Also, it gets pretty hot, probably not a problem, but something to think about.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be steady improvement with new apps and functionality over time.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Good initial product from Google. The set up is a bit clumsy and took a few tries to get it going. netflix subscription that came with it was a very good bonus. Casting is simple. Being able to push Youtube is also great. Also like the fact that once the casting starts you are free to do whatever you want on the computer. I would have rated it a 5 if I could push more content (pictures, movies from my computer) and the setup was a bit easier.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very addicting game. Super fun! Challenging. Awesome game! If you like bubble pop games then this a game for you.

B000002ULO|3.0|As a life-long Beatles and Wings fan, this was the first McCartney solo album I've purchased. I'm kind of thinking it with be the last, though. Here are some descriptive phrases that I think sum it up:<br /><br />\\"An extremely okay album\\"<br />\\"Supremely acceptable\\"<br />\\"Positively pleasant to listen to\\"<br />\\"Mature and mellow, yet Beatlesque\\"<br />\\"It's just fine, like a nice vanilla ice cream\\"<br />\\"As truly likeable as an old hound dog\\"<br /><br />Yes, I made all of these up :-)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there's very little wrong with this album, and the last track, \\"Great Day\\", in particular kind of leaves you wishing the rest of the album was as good as that one is [Think combination of Neil Young, Blind Faith and White Album-era Beatles]. However, Chase Bank chose this as jingle song for one of their adds--which may shed some light on the everyman/woman flavor of it. Steve Miller's presence on the album adds a certain charm, and I can't imagine there will be many McCartney/Beatles fans that will truly dislike it. It's very likeable, smooth, and melodic.<br /><br />That said, I can't help but feel it's unremarkable, somewhat formulaic and with some overly repetitive songs that may remind you just how short the majority of Beatles songs were. For such an accomplished artist, the album somewhat forgettable. A lot of mature/boomer artists have made similar albums, but many such albums have been closer to perfection. The one that stands out in my mind is Neil Young's Harvest Moon. Equally as smooth, mature and nice to listen to, but better compiled, even more inspired. Bob Dylan also released an album with a polished, twilight years feel to it around the same time period that was also notably better.<br /><br />If you're a big McCartney/Beatles fan, DO buy his album. Just don't expect miracles, as few tracks will meet your expectations.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|The latest update of this app is a complete failure! When I got the new endor level the app would crash when I tried to play it. There was a new update that was supposed to fix that ; now the app crashes after playing the opening slideshow. Outstanding :/
0385349947|4.0|was a gift to my daughter therefore I have not read the book.  she is trying to climb the ladder
006091307X|4.0|This book was my introduction to Pynchon and, being such an easy, fluid read, should probably be the introduction for everyone.  If you're reading this review you probably already know how important Mr. Pynchon is to modern existential, surreal literature.  This book is a terrific foundation and precursor that will get you excited to read the thicker volumes of his work.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|After reading the book of the same name, this movie just didn't compare. Big surprise I suppose, as so many people say the same thing about so many books-turned-movies. But I really expected this to be at least almost as funny and dramatic and dark as the book, and it just didn't live up to expectations. It actually starts out good with some quick humor, but it very quickly dies down and the majority of the movie drags. Acting is mostly sub-par too, which does it no favors. If you're looking for something to pop in and have as background noise while you work on some homework, it's not terrible. If you're actually looking for Isaac Marion-level entertainment, read one of his books.

B00E34A9FU|5.0|This is a must have Box Set for any Grateful Dead fan. The Dead were still on a high just coming back from their first & very successful Europe 72 tour. This show at The Springfield Creamery Benefit at Kesey's Creamery. August 27, 1972.the sun was beating down hard and bright on that fateful day in Veneta, Oregon when the Grateful Dead heeded Ken Kesey's call to help save the family Creamery. The 100-degree and rising temperatures did not deter the band who were still riding high from their adventures across the pond & playing for the estimated 20,000 Dead Heads who showed up.<br /><br />The band have an amazing amount of energy at this show. The Dead seem to effortlessly play there in the 100 degree heat with passion & momentum. Song's like Sugaree,Deal,Bertha just seem to spill out of Jerry Garcia & his guitar with ease.Then you get into the more complicated & longer songs like Playing In The Band,Bird Song & a glorious 31 minutes of Dark Star.<br /><br />With this set i bought the CD/ Bu-Ray numbered edition from The dead's web site because this was limited to 12,500 copies. you also get a Bonus documentary \\"Grateful Days\\" featuring brand new interviews with Mountain Girl, Sam Cutler, Wavy Gravy, Ken Babbs, and more. A 40-page book featuring original essays by Nicholas G. Meriwether, Ken Babbs, Sam Field, Johnny Dwork, and David Lemieux.The Original tie-dye slipcase by Courtenay Pollock & Illustrations by Grammy-winning artist and designer Steve Vance. This show was an epic performance from 1972 & that was their most epic period. I'm shocked that it took this long for them to finally remaster this & put it out but What A Long Strange Trip It's Been.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie was filled with humor and accuracy about people that are just like any average person.  Taking into account that all people have issues they deal with.  Five stars because I could relate to the story line with humor.  Laughing is more fun than crying.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is an addictive and entertaining puzzle game in my opinion.  You are shown the finished product that you are supposed to create and given the different tools necessary to make it.  It can get quite tricky but I enjoyed figuring out the way to create each one.  The game might be a bit short, as I don't consider myself one who plays this type of thing quite frequently and I was able to finish it in a couple of days pretty easily.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I found this device simple and efficient.  I use this device to copy all of my 35 mm film into digital copies.  I was able to do a roll of film (24 exposures) in less than 5 minutes.  The process is very smooth if your film is on sheets of three or more.  If you do single fram then the process is a little longer.  I especially like the feature that you are able to view your exposures while you are copying.  This makes this device more efficient as you can choose what you want to save or not.  I recommnend using a picture program editor like Picasa as some of the pictures will have to be inverted when viewed.  I havent figured out how to invert the original photos yet, but I'm sure there is a way to do that and I will look into it within the next week.  I completely recommend this device for anyone who has a box or boxes of old 35 mm film that need to get them turned into digital photos.  It brought new life to all of my old photos and saved me a lot of money because I originally thought I had to take my old negatives to get them reprinted or saved digitally at a professional studio.
1433502410|5.0|My pastor highly recommended it. We were studying John in depth so this version gave us great insight. God Blessed it.
B0082Z447U|4.0|Highly improbable, but an enjoyable page-turner.  A bit uneven, with some dramatic periods interspersed with mind-numbingly boring ones.  Overall, definitely recommended, especially for the sake of Count Fosco, one of the most excellent characters ever conceived.  His advice on managing women is spot on!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Can't wait for the CD to be released!!  I love Lady GaGa!!  She's another Madonna! She will def be a name people will talk about for generations!
B009NX409M|4.0|Loved the movie - I enjoyed both actors (Meryl Streep and Robert Di Niro).  Life can be complicated.  Life should end so happily!
B00E978FGQ|5.0|I missed this in the theaters and liked the pre-views. It's a good movie and I'm happy I purchased so that I can watch on my iPad when I travel.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|This double disc Symphonic Masterpiece is well produced and a great companion to the Live show available on DVD or Bluray ! The only thing I wish is that the artwork would have been presented Inside the disc with some more Fantastic Shots of a Wonderful Tour. I'm sure a pictorial book is on the way! For now my eyes and ears can't get enough MDNA! I'm Addicted!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|$35 for streaming tv in HD, you could not have dreamed up anything better. I purchased this device thinking only about the potential and future apps. I currently own 2 Rokus, 2 Smart Bluray players, 1 Apple TV, 1 Smart TV not to mention 3 iPads, 2 iPhones,1 Xbox and 1 Wii all with streaming. I like because I save money on streaming  and I'm a big tech head too. The Google Chromecast has potential in the future to offer mirroring, games and more. So depending on what released in the coming months I plan to purchase at least 3 more of these.
B0093LFGMO|5.0|Extremely impressed with the talent and tenacity of the Great Brit Robbie Williams who has Much Earned this crown with a brilliant captivating album. No 2 songs are the same! This is one of my All time Favorites! Can't wait for a UK Release of the Tour! Thank God for all Region DVD players and Thank God for Mister Williams!!  PS-The DVD is a short background of him and his posse making the album. Fun and interesting but mostly short sweet studio time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book you are so awesome. I'm going to tell all my friends about this book. LOVE IT
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This movie made me want to read the book!  So, I did!  Now I'm gonna watch the movie again!!  It's a movie that makes you PONDER things in life!
B00338QENI|4.0|The Immortal Life tells the story of an African-American young woman whose cancerous tissue was used to make huge scientific and medical advances - not to mention heaps of money - without her consent or knowledge.  Rebecca Skloot does a good job making the story interesting, including elements of family, science, ethics, etc; but certain aspects of the story are inherently PG-13.  The book touches on a number of issues, including racism, medical ethics, misdiagnosis and mistreatment of the \\"insane,\\" etc.  Overall, I'd have to say it's pretty good, but I wouldn't have bought it except that it was required for school.
B00CISC244|5.0|I've been a fan of BOC for about 15 years. I was a HUGE fan of everything up until The Campfire Headphase, which for some reason I could never really get into. It didn't have that creepy vibe of the older stuff like Geogaddi which is my favorite of their previous albums. TCH made me feel that perhaps they'd lost it, so I was very skeptical of this release. I decided to give it a chance, partially because I just wanted something of theirs on vinyl and didn't want to miss that opportunity. I ended up really liking this album a lot. Very creepy and ominous. Lots of atmosphere and dark places to get lost in. Everybody writes the same basic stuff in reviews: post-apocalyptic 80s John Carpenter movie soundtrack, and it's all pretty accurate. Five thumbs up.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed by a Ken Follett piece. This is the fifth book I have red if his. I am excited for the final book of the trilogy. It will be interesting to see how he ties in all the characters, as he is so good at.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|I realize there were some injuries among the singers working with &#34;the machine&#34; in this production, but the effect the machine allows without stopping the action or undue backstage noise was worth it, I think.  This production is mesmerizing, and has a dream cast.  I've waited a long time to purchase this, but I'm thrilled I now have it.  One thing's for sure -- this ain't your grandmama's Wagner opera!!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Rainbow Rowell `s writing captures life and people with such pinpoint accuracy, breathing life into mundane everyday moments and to voicing the thoughts in our head that make us feel alone. So many times while reading, if felt as though she was writing to me; not me, the reader; but me, Whitley.  And I know I'm not alone in falling under the spell of her words. It's not just that they're powerful (they are); they're familiar, as though she knew you and you knew the characters before ever stepping into the first page.<br /><br />I love Cath.  She's torch bearer of every awkward turtle introvert flailing their way through the social life they don't understand (and won't admit that they don't always want). She's frustrating, yes, but every frustration I had with her was one that I've experienced with myself. Her anxiety and overthinking and self-deprecation are so realistic that the reader feels reflected in Cath's struggles and grows with her throughout the story. There's been a lot of attention lately to the traits and strengths of an introvert in the extrovert world, but its rare to see a main character remain an introvert... and to see her and her supporting cast accept and embrace that instead of joining the author in a quest to change her. I love YA, but it can be frustrating to see the truth of yourself belittled instead of embraced, and as a reader, a fictional story I can fall into is a much more powerful source of acceptance and empowerment and feeling not-so-alone than a buzzfeed article.<br /><br />And man oh man do I love Cath's supporting cast. Her relationship with her twin sister, Wren, personifies the person we introverts think we should (and struggle to) be... independent from our the close friends we made as kids, happily active in the social scene. Cath struggles through the book with this sudden differentiation between herself and Wren when they enter into college, and a major part of her growth as a character is through her acceptance that it's OKto be different from her sister and to chose to say \\"no\\" to parties instead of \\"yes\\".<br /><br />Reagan, perfectly described as Adele, \\"if Adele had a harder, somewhat sharper twin sister\\", is just about as boisterous as they come. She's also is the best thing that could have happened to Cath because she doesn't take any of Cath's excuses, but she also knows not to push Cath. Her friendship and guidance was exactly what Cath needed at this time in her life, and I loved her character. While the fact that she previously dated Levy is a major complication in the story, it is also  a perfect opportunity for Cath to stop comparing herself to others, and for that reason, I love the ground rules that Reagan imposes when Cath begins to show interest in Levy.<br /><br />Ahh, Levy. We've come to my favorite part of the story (and my literary crush).  What isn't there to love about Levy? He's cute (but not too cute); he's goofy; he's flawed (and have I mentioned how much I love, love, LOVE flawed characters?). What makes Levy so perfect in his imperfections is that he nudges without being pushy, he genuinely cares about Cath without claiming she's perfect (because really, who is?), and he seems to understand Cath enough to allow her to take things in her own time. Not to mention the fact that he actively takes interest in her interests, helping her to boost her confidence, rather than laughing at them... and I mean, really, slash Harry Potter-esque fanfiction is a little hard not to balk at. Yes, the romance was formulaic once it took off, but it was also completely swoon worthy and the whole reason I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I couldn't find anything to dislike about FANGIRL, but if I could have changed one thing, it would have been the ending. It's not that I didn't like how it ended (because I did). It's just that the ending was so embedded in Cath's fanfiction and the final book of the Simon Snow series that real final moment felt lost. I think I understand why Rowell chose to end the book the way she did... Cath's attachment to the series and the fandom is all based around the idea that as a reader, we don't want the story to end. So Rowell didn't end it. Instead, she let both Cath and Levy and the reader slip further into the story. Even so, there were so many questions left unanswered and issues, unresolved, that when I \\"turned\\" the page to find nothing more, I was disappointed. More than anything, I didn't want the story to end... I wanted more.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. If you've ever been part of a fandom (or even a lurker on FF.net), were the socially \\"awkward turtle\\" at some point in your life, or liked Eleanor & Park or Sarah Dessen's coming-of-age stories with the perfect mix of romance, then you'll love Rainbow Rowell's FANGIRL.<br /><br />Of course, there will be readers who will roll their eyes at the idea of a fandom and Cath's introversion and nerdiness, but to everyone else, I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />{Review originally posted at whitleyabell.wordpress.com}
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is one of the best I've watched in a long time.  It is so realistic that even though I know it's a fiction, I wake up worrying about these people.  (Second only to Game of Thrones - that's the best - sorry to include this in Walking Dead review, but I couldn't help myself.)

B00D2CYU2W|3.0|Douglas and Damon nail these characters. The movie is worth a watch just for the peculiar performances given. I honestly didn't know a thing about the man, and still don't know all the much of his stage career. But, I do know a heck of a lot about his private life thanks to the film. Soderberg, again, directs a movie that you can't look away from. Though the movie is solidly about his love life, and sometimes raunchy, it is done with crafty precision. The sets are amazing too. Michael Douglas really transformed himself and acting style to create this wild character.
1885167776|5.0|As a small business owner, I have read many, many books on how to accomplish one's goals, how to set goals, how to achieve success,etc. And those books were great, but this book is quite different.  Frankly if you only read ONE book, it should be this one!  Gary Keller with Jay Papasan have managed to capture not just the essence of what it takes to achieve extraordinary results, but have mapped out a true \\"how to\\" guide with this book.  While the real estate community is most familiar with these authors, these folks are some of the most forward thinking business leaders of our time and need to be widely known beyond the bounds of their chosen industry, in my opinion.  Gary Keller's ideas and methods for achieving success work, and of course he and his company are living proof of this, given their extraordinary results.  I had been to seminars and conferences where Gary and Jay have spoken.  They practice what they preach.  There is no magic pill, no \\"specialness\\" required, no gurus or fancy meditations.  It's all about practicality, mapping out in the most effective way (which Gary teaches in the book)the type of goal setting and planning that WILL create extraordinary results. And then he teaches HOW to actually focus in and act upon those goals.  He basically turns goal setting on its head and shows us how many people do it backwards - and he's right!  Through this book, I learned about the myths around multi-tasking and this was a huge takeaway for me.  I read this book at a time when I needed to figure out some things in my business (which is not real estate), focus in and get things done to achieve the kind of results I know I am capable of achieving.  Because of this book, I had found my One Thing that I needed to concentrate on to create the domino effect which WILL lead to the results I am after - again, Gary explains this in the book :).  How do I know this actually works?  Because I am following the steps outlined and am already seeing a huge difference in my results. You cannot possibly read this book, follow all of the advice/steps and not achieve extraordinary results.  I believe that would be impossible.  Thank you Gary Keller and Jay Papasan for an actual \\"How To\\" book on achieving results!  Sincerely, Susan Ringer, Owner, My Pretty Office - The Premier Online Desk Accessories and Office Supplies Boutique.

0865479410|5.0|I probably read too many self help books, and often they are a bit of a chore. Burkeman's great writing, intelligence and sense of humor make this a mostly quick and enjoyable read. Much of the stuff he covers I knew about before - Mindfulness meditation, Stoic philosophy, Carol Dweck's growth mindset, Albert Ellis and exposure therapy. So most of the ideas are not really new - he is talking about other people's ideas and trying to bring them together - but the writing is quick and loaded with interesting nuggets that even if it's not new to you it's enjoyable.  Occasionally the book gets really profound, as when it talks about the way we close ourselves off to life by trying to avoid change. I'm happy I read it.

For those unfamiliar with Tyr, if you enjoy music like Iron Maiden, you'll enjoy this.<br /><br />As for the vinyl itself, it's well mastered, and there is no surface noise on the record. There is also no excess sibilance or anything like that. It's just as clean sounding as a CD. The clear vinyl looks cool too!
031623480X|5.0|If you care about your long term brain health this book is simply a must read.  This book is fairly unusual with up-to-date information on issues that simply aren't well known by the public.  The diet is basically paleo but the reasons are critically different from what you normally hear.  Yes he talks about general health benefit but the information on what you are doing to your brain and how important it is for you to change is what makes this book unique.<br /><br />This information is available elsewhere in multiple books in detail.  However, Perlmutter brings it all together focusing on the brain in a book that is outstanding and in my view has created an incredibly important book.<br /><br />You can preview much of this book with Amazon's \\"Look Inside\\" feature and I recommend you take advantage of that and see how it is organized.  I highly recommend this excellent book to everyone.  It is very well done and important.

B00DJYKFXG|3.0|Revised 9/22/2013<br />Thanks for comments to my original review, which I wrote on the day this product was released. Upon further listening, I agree with Jennifer C: The new sound mixes are quite good. I also enjoy hearing the horn section work thru the arrangements. Altogether more spontaneous & alive than their later, more polished performances of the tunes. Jerry S was right to chide me: I was too harsh in my original review & have since boosted my rating to 3 stars.<br /><br />- - - - Original review below. - - -<br />Consider this product Rock of Ages, the Director's Cut. I've been a pretty hard core fan of The Band since Big Pink, playing the early vinyl and latter releases regularly for 40+ years. I strongly favor their earlier work, and was hoping for good concert performances. I should have read the product description more carefully. As other reviewers note, 39 of 56 CD tracks are previously released material, with only 17 new audio tracks. The DVD contains 25 AUDIO tracks in 5.1 surround sound accompanied by a slide show with a limited number of photos, plus  grainy film clips of just 2 unreleased performances. The book is about 25 pages of concert & production photos & memorabilia, with liner notes by Robbie Robertson, Alan Toussaint & Jim James. Ironically, tucked in the front cover is a facsimile of Ralph J. Gleason's Rolling Stone review of Rock of Ages (October 12, 1972).<br /><br />You've got to be more hard core than me to consider this product a value. I was carried away by the prospect of unreleased audio and film performances, but about $4/song is too high for me. The Band was great in its prime, but there's only so much ore in the mine, Robbie.<br /><br />As for the music, you can get 70% of the performances for 20% of the price of this product on the Rock of Ages CDs.[[ASIN:B002UV0QPQ Rock Of Ages]] and you can buy the remaining unreleased tracks for $1.29 each, such as [[ASIN:B00F0XCP1E Strawberry Wine (Live At The Academy Of Music / 1971)]]. Learn from my mistake!<br /><br />I recommend the Mobile Fidelity vinyl reissues of The Band [[ASIN:B00DI67O5C Band]] and [[ASIN:B004SGYI7S Stage Fright]], as well as other early albums, Watkins Glen [[ASIN:B000TDG9OE Live At Watkins Glen]] and, of course, The Last Waltz [[ASIN:B00F2H7VOY The Last Waltz]]. Note that each album may be available in various versions. Also, Classic Albums: The Band is a decent documentary (available on Netflix).

B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This novel of Afghanistan by the author of The Kite Runner and the recently published And the Mountains Echoed is an exploration of the relationships between men and women during recent and current periods in that country's history. The book is not anti-Muslim, and we should remember that repression of women was a feature of the culture there before Afghanistan's relatively recent conversion to Islam. We should also recall that Greek, Roman, and Hebrew societies during the Classic and Hellenistic periods did not treat women as fully human. The story is well written, difficult to put down, and very disturbing, largely because we can see echoes of the subjugation of women in households in our own neighborhoods.

The way she expresses her feelings about her mother and family is just amazing and so honest.  There were so many lines that went straight to my heart (having lost my mother at a young age also) that I want to read the book again.  (I do have to admit, though, as a die-hard animal lover who will not step on a bug, I completely skipped the section about the horse.  But that's just me.)  I highly recommend this book.

B00BT70J7M|5.0|Jonas Kaufmman is modeling his career as the all-purpose tenor in the mold of Placido Domingo. Those of us praying for a great Wagner tenor will have to share oxygen with equally desperate opera lovers who want a great Verdi tenor, verismo tenor, and French tenor. It's fascinating how well Kaufmann fits the bill. You wouldn't think at first listen that his dark, baritonal tone could ring out with Italianate squillo, for example, but it does. It seem like superfluous blessings that he is intelligent, highly musical, an accomplished stage actor - and thin.<br /><br />For his debut album on Sony, having jumped from Decca (perhaps with a guarantee of complete opera recordings?), the celebrated tenor, now in his mid-forties, gives us some very familiar Verdi arias from Rigoletto to Otello, with the exception of one rarity from I Masnadieri.  The tag of \\"self-recommending\\" applies.  Set against his superb verismo and Wagner recitals, however, this one is slightly inferior because of the ordinary conducting by Pier Giorgio Morandi, a routinier who at times pulls back the reins on his soloist. But even when the pacing becomes lackluster, Kaufmann throws himself into the music with controlled abandon - clearly he wants to establish his cred as a great Verdi singer, even though so far he has sung only seven roles on stage, mostly in Don Carlo and Traviata. This summer saw an excellent Trovatore in Munich.<br /><br />As heard at the Met, where every appearance has been a triumph, Kaufmann's voice isn't large on the order of Vickers or Del Monaco, but more in line with Domingo's. If he eventually sings Otello, he will succeed as much on artistry as on sheer volume - again like Domingo - and this season's Parsifal showed how intelligently Kaufmann already marshals his forces in a very taxing opera. He's not afraid to sing softly and wait for the big moments to ring out.<br /><br />All-purpose tenors always have decided strengths and relative weaknesses. For me, Kaufmann doesn't sound like the rakish Duke in 'La donna e mobile,' but the intrinsic soulfulness in his delivery makes him perfect for Don Carlo, Alvaro, Manrico, and Otello. If I had to choose, the very best thing here is the long aria from Forza del Destino with clarinet obligato, a wonderful display of Kaufmann's messa di voce, although the numbers from Trovatore are so secure and confident that they come as a breath of fresh air after the strained pushing from lyric tenors like Ramon Vargas and Marcelo Alvarez, who followed Carreras's example to boost themselves into bigger heroic Verdi roles.<br /><br />Kaufmann is the real thing, a robust, charismatic dramatic tenor who can live comfortably in Verdi's fervent melodramatic world of outsized passion and suffering. This natural fit, far more than any reservations about sounding \\"Italian\\" enough, is what makes him invaluable on the international opera scene. He's one of a kind, offering no quarter to the great tenors of the golden age.sound like the rakish Duke in 'La donna e mobile,' but the intrinsic soulfulness in his delivery makes him perfect for Don Carlo, Alvaro, Manrico, and Otello.

B00D2MC8WG|5.0|DG put down a marker when its first Dudamel release duplicated a famous pairing of the Beethoven Fifth and Seventh by Carlos Kleiber. Now guess who is being challenged with Also Sprach Zarathustra as played by the Berlin Phil.?  The ghost of Karajan will hover over every Richard Strauss recording for the foreseeable future, and rightly so. He made three spectacular commercial recordings of Zarathustra, two with Berlin, one with vienna (my favorite, on Decca), and now there's a live performance on Testament. Despite its famously bombastic opening, Zarathustra isn't quite the orchestral blockbuster that Ein Heldenleben is, but it gives more scope, perhaps, for expressive interpretation in the later sections.<br /><br />For anyone who is primarily interested in hearing demonstration-quality sound, there is a Japanese version of this new Zarathustra in super-duper SHM sound for around fifty dollars. For the rest of us, I'd say that the DG engineers have tried to balance sonic impact with a natural concert ambience. They've succeeded quite well at this, to my ears. So on to Dudamel's interpretation. Happily, it displays a real feeling for the piece and also demonstrates how thoughtfully the young superstar conductor has grown. He takes the score seriously and applies long, expressive slow downs and lingering phrases throughout, as in the tender string passage that immediately follows the slambang opening. It's so measured as to be startling.<br /><br />Such a sensitive approach verges on the self-conscious, so Dudamel probably won't please listeners who want a thrill ride from beginning to end - Solti fits the bill there. As for the Berlin sound, I hope we're past the stage where ol-timers lament that \\"it's not like Karajan.\\" As a disciplined machine, Berlin may have fallen off, but they have gained far more by being freed up. You get the same sense as with Abbado and Rattle that an ensemble of great soloists is being allowed to blossom. Frankly, Zarathustra has become an old shoe for any accomplished orchestra, so I was grateful to hear Dudamel apply so many personal touches. This is far from a cookie-cutter reading.<br /><br />P.S. - Relistening to Karajan's Decca recording, I find that his tempos were as slow as Dudamel's in Zarathustra's quieter passages - a surprise.<br /><br />To underline the challenge to Karajan, we get two fillers, Don Juan and Till Eulenspiegel, that accompany the Originals reissue of his early-Seventies Zarathustra. The new readings tend to be straightforward, slightly too serious but played with the Berliners' astonishing virtuosity. Dudamel could have given us more wit and swagger - Karajan wins hands down in these pieces.  But the decision isn't so clear in Zarathustra, where Strauss took a philosophical work as his inspiration. Surely there's room for Dudamel's attempt to make the music sound philosophical, too.n old shoe for any accomplished orchestra, so I was grateful to hear Dudamel apply so many personal touches.

0062059963|4.0|THE ELITE by Kiera Cass (YA Romance)<br />This second book in the Selection series is better than the first. While the first book introduced  the candidates vying for the hand of Prince Maxon, this story narrows the focus to his favored among the Elite. America isn't certain whether Maxon or her former flame holds her heart. Can she trust Maxon, or is he as cunning as his forebears? As she learns more about the royal family's history, she isn't sure her place is among them. Rebel attacks bring home the unrest of the people. But when she makes a bid for change, the resultant fallout causes her to reevaluate her goals. Then a friend is severely punished for a discretion, and America learns to bide her time...something Maxon has been trying to teach her all along. Can these two disparate people come together to save a country? Or will the dark forces that are gathering take them down?<br /><br />I liked the more serious turn that made this less of a frivolous YA novel and gave it more depth. I'm hoping America will mature to stand her ground and make her choice. We'll have to wait for book three for the conclusion. Meanwhile, the story is fun and fast-paced and will keep your interest, although you'll wish America would stop her dithering and choose her man.

0670024813|4.0|I read the highlighted reviews before I bought this book, some quite long I must say. After reading the most helpful positive and critical review I was tempted not to buy the book. I really enjoyed Diamond's previous two books and hoped this would be another gem. As my title states, there were tons of interesting facts and stories in this book but the whole book did not seem to flow together that much. I enjoyed the book but took my time reading through it. There are some interesting moments.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The author's heart clearly was no longer in writing his series. It felt very much like an obligatory wrap-up. Without giving away spoilers, all I can say that the speed with which relationships were wrapped up or renewed gave me whiplash. And the plot was also thrown together with random &#34;villains&#34; lacking any real motivation.  It doesn't matter if you're Team Eric, Team Bill, Team Sam, or whomever. The story is so rushed and random, thre's no way to be happy with it.<br /><br />In short, a horrible end to what was once such a rich and intricate series.<br /><br />If you MUST read this, I understand. But do yourself a favor and borrow it from a library so you'll feel less cheated.

I got a tripod with it, that naturally doesn't actually go with it.<br /><br />I'm admittedly technologically challenged, but in buying what is essentially a tape recorder, for $299 (including all accessories) I would have expected a very simple plug and play and upload/download machine.<br /><br />In searching the internet for some assistance, again, no help and I got the feeling I was the only one having trouble. Also no help from Austin Bazaar and no return policy. I didn't keep the packaging anyway-I assumed it would just work-or if I didn't the retailer would take it back.<br /><br />If you are looking for a simple recording device, this ain't it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game will keep you entertained for days and weeks. I found it very addictive and fun. spent hours on the game already.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Enjoy spending time searching the rooms. Still learning what to do with the &#34;extras&#34; that frame the rooms. Have fun!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I less than three this movie so much. It makes me want to start my own acapella group I swear!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great job, Mrs.Harris! THANK YOU! I wasn't certain what trouble was left for Sookie to get into, but you made that fun and exciting. Plus, you brought back so many of our favorite characters from the previous books-the good, the bad, and the newly-ugly!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought this in January for my boyfriend and it stopped working in Sept.. It does not respond to anything. We plugged in the USB and the controller doesn't even light up. We have barely used it (maybe a dozen times in the last 8 months) and it is in mint condition. I suspect this controller is a fake, because we have much more heavily used PS3 controllers that have lasted much, much longer. I bought it through Amazon (Prime 2-day shipping) so I didn't think there would be a problem, but clearly, this is not the real deal.<br /><br />As some others have said, buy at your own peril!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a great book to read.  I really enjoyed the story, and learning what Mitch Rapp is up to during this one.  He is a great character.<br /><br />This one is worth the money!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Really great story from a great author.  It was a short read but kept my attention the entire way through.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I picked this book and put it down several times over the course of a year.  I was drawn to it, but could never purchase it.  Finally, I downloaded it to my Kindle and read it.  What an amazing story!  I really enjoyed this thought provoking novel.  It is worth the money to get and read this book.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I like this game, it is fun, interactive, challenging, and got my brain going. I like to play in the morning while I drink my coffee.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|I purchased this book after reading Ender's Game.  I also read many of the reviews which said this book was as good or better than Ender's Game.  However, I guess I never got it, because I didn't really care for it.  It was ok, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it again.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This is a good book. I recommend reading it. I hope to see it get good reviews from others.  READ IT
B000SEIK2S|4.0|It's a good book with an interesting premise.  I would recommend it to anyone who like Starship Troopers with the understanding that it's not quite Heinlein but still a worthwhile read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I enjoy the weather channel not only for its reliable forecasts, but also for all of the extras that is offered as well.
B003IDMUVI|5.0|A great book from the start to the end, had trouble putting it down, if your after a great read this is awesome
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While this was not the best novel I have ever read, it was better than I expected. I plan on reading the next book in the series.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Jack is back with a really solid album. A very well produced album from start to finish that does justices to Jack's song writing and acoustic melodies. I would highly recommend it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey for a while and it is without a doubt the best Android keyboard around. The predictions are almost 100% accurate and the SwiftKey Flow option is easily a worthy rival for Swype. If you are wondering what keyboard replacement to get then get SwiftKey.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Uno is a great card game and to have an app for my Kindle is even better! The app is great it's colorful fun and exciting!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a great book to read easy to get into and take you away to far away places. Recommend it
B004PGO25O|5.0|If you are ever smart enough to read this book you will thank yourself.  Again, he tells me what I need to know without excess or BS.
1451627297|4.0|Other reviews here will eloquently detail the magic of this book.  I only want to say how much I enjoyed it.  Awesome immersion into the past that came back alive for me with each page.  Beautiful mastery of sci fi as the story progressed.<br /><br />Only thing I found lacking was the character Sadie.  I suppose it could be just my perspective, but King's female characters often seem tinny to me.  Eh, what do men know about us women?!  I still loved the book =D
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I think this is tied for first in books I've read, and its tied with the Theo Boone nook, kid lawyer, this is a great book, I recommend it for anyone who likes John Gresham.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It helps drown out my awful a/c noise in the summer and it's nice to wake up to the sounds of the ocean when you live in the desert.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|i love this game. i do a whole lot of crazy things when i play this game. i defiantly recommend this  game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
030758836X|3.0|I have to give it three stars but keep in mind I could not put it down.  It was a great read but I was sooo dissapointed with the ending I was angry.  The story was awesome but as a Law and Order casual fan, there were so many obvious crime story flaws I was frustrated.  I wished I was a detective in the story!  And the end, while unexpected, was so frustrating and unrealistic.  It was your classic twist but with holes and left me unsatisfied.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is my favourite app of 30 I have on my Kindle Fire HD.  I have used it many times a day.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book, but at times it was a bit confusing. One did not always realise in which period one was, maybe this is worse when reading on a Kindle. I would recommend it though as like the other two books by the same writer, the story-telling is terrific.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I can sleep through most alarms. This gets me up every time. The weather feature is a major plus for an area were weather can be dangerous.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Once you start watching Game of Thrones,, everything else will seem like kids play. This is not for the timid to watch. Addicting OBSOLUTELY ! Nothing even comes close to this series.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|Solid looking graphics and enjoyable game play. Plenty of cars to buy and upgrade as well. I like how you are not forced to send real world money for in-game items, That's always a huge plus for me considering how racing games generally try to get you to do so.<br /><br />There are only 2 things I dislike about it. The first is that the graphics don't always load right, You will see when playing that graphics may look good in one area but very poor further down the road (you'll see when you are driving), Would be nice to have solid looking graphics through out. Also, I think turning controls could use some work as well, I can't tell you how many times I have to turn my Kindle a near 180 degrees in order to finish a turn.<br /><br />Other than that, Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it.
0060574216|5.0|This book will open one's mind's eye to understanding women. My only suggestion is, if you are going to read it, be prepared for aha moments, humor, and some frustrations, once you understand they way women think.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|It is fun, I will give Cubetris that. However, It needs a bit of work. They need to work on the snapping feature (that automatically puts the pieces into place) because it doesn't work properly all the time. They need to develop a way to save your game instead of having you write down your previous level and then putting it in the next time you play. Also adding a few difficult puzzles would be nice as well because all the ones I have played so far have been rather easy.<br /><br />Other than that, It's a pretty solid app. Just needs some work.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Never saw the movie, but I love this song.  This may be a kid's movie but the song stands on its own.
B00F0AAC26|5.0|I am far from an expert on Elvis Costello's album catalog, but I have enjoyed the variety in style from what I have sampled.  He tackles jazz (North), eclectic rock (Momofuku), and roots/folk (Secret, Profane & Sugarcane) with aplomb.  Recently, I saw Wise Up Ghost on the upcoming album list, and I saw that this time he teamed up with The Roots.  I am not very familiar with The Roots, but I figured that this was destined to be a funk and soul filled offering.<br /><br />That is exactly what I found when I started listening to Wise Up Ghost.  If you've been to Costello's web site in the last month or so, you've most likely heard the opening track \\"Walk Us Uptown\\".  It begins over 55 minutes of Costello's biting social commentary backed by grooves from The Roots.  I found \\"Come The Meantimes\\" to be one of the best displays of the unusual chemistry that this artist pairing produced.  The opening bass line on \\"Refuse To Be Saved\\" is funky with filthy distortion.  Longtime Costello fans should check out \\"Sugar Won't Work\\" for some of his vocal harmonies and hooks on the chorus.  One of the more interesting tracks is the English/Spanish duet \\"Cinco Minutos Con Vos\\" with La Marisoul.  Costello channels Guy Garvey from Elbow on the first verse while he returns to himself for verse three and beyond.<br /><br />If you are an adventurous Elvis Costello fan (is there any other kind?), you must give this a try.  Wise Up Ghost works as party music or concentrated solo listening equally well.  Uncertain?  Head over to Costello's site and listen to \\"Walk Us Uptown\\" in its entirety.  If you like it, I think you'll enjoy this unique album in its entirety.<br /><br />Download this:  Walk Us Uptown
0763644765|2.0|This book is ridiculous! Cute pictures but terribly done &#34;plot&#34;. I basically make my own story up when reading this because it's so lame. There are better potty books out there.
B00DNV9V1W|4.0|I purchased this product with Amazon Prime, so I got it in 2 days. It came with 3 screen protectors, a cleaning cloth, a card to assist with the application of the screen and dust removal strips.<br /><br />The instructions were clear and straight forward, and the application of the screen to the phone was VERY EASY...even if they were bubbles when I was finished they can easily be pushed to the side and be gone immediately. Btw my boyfriend bought this same brand  however it was the S3 Screen Protector package and the application was great with that as well, so it shows consistency across products.<br />As it relates to after application another good point is that the touch sensitivity is remarkably the same with the screen protector on as it was without the screen protector.<br /><br />My only negative comment is that grease and dust build up on the screen quite easily, and I constantly have to remove any residue with the cleaning cloth, while i noticed that I didn't have that problem with my phone without the screen protector. However it does show me what would have been going on my phone if i didn't have the screen protector and I wouldn't want that especially since my phone is white.<br /><br />Overall I love this screen protector brand and if i needed to I would purchase it again :).
1419702238|5.0|my cousin loved the book and read it a million times. def. worth the buy. great book no doubt about it
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Boy, did this book keep me on the edge of my seat. I think this is the best James Rollins book ever.
B006AN78XS|5.0|Engaging, fun to watch, educational, and relatable. A nice movie to see more than once and to share with friends and family.
B005K17RU0|5.0|includes a very good radar, temps for up to 10 days, and hourly temps that are prettq close. I check it every morning.
1455510319|5.0|This author keeps me spell bound from the first page to the last page.  It keeps be up late at night.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A really fun game to play. Like Temple Run, but you don't have to tilt the device, and I don't think it uses up as much battery as Temple Run does. I would really recommend this game to everyone for all ages. my only setback is that it is very repetitive, and can be frustrating at times. other than that, its great! and FREE!!! :)
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Constantly freezes and gets black screens and you can not save. Not worth the money. It would be fun if I did not have to start over each time!!!!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|It amplifies and works reasonably well for the price. Would buy again and seems like a solid product. Amplifies stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome in so many ways so glad I found this game I just love it I am just stunned
B0027MJU00|3.0|I like this author's work but this was more gory and desolate. Maybe because I live in the Midwest and remember the farm crisis. Maybe it's a little too real for me.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I was looking for a free planner, but I couldn't find anything near perfect. When I found this I decided to give it a try. The Jorte calender was great. It wasn't a planner and it was confusing for a while, but this app is able to have background pictures, like ones you might have taken. It's a calender anyone could work with. But if you are getting this for placing icons/stickers on the calendars days of a month, keep in mind that the icons it allows you to use are not cool, not a big deal. I would recommend you getting it.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Just endless patting themselves on the back about what great film makers they are. Paramount, you suck! I. Very disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because I thought it was a great book and it has a lot of potential in it.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|I have every album from Jack Johnson and From Here To Now To You is typical Jack Johnson.  Its a nice album, with a relaxing sound and strong lyrics.  Listening to it makes you want to go outside enjoy the sunshine and drink some wine.  I am not sure if any of the songs are catchy enough to make it to the radio but that should not keep you from buying it.  Favorite song is Dont Believe a Thing I Say.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars is in my opinion this album is not as strong as some of his other albums.  Still it is a solid cd and should be included on any roadtrip playlist.
B00005M1Y2|1.0|I got the DVD promptly enough, but it doesn't work! I am Not happy! When I spend that much money on something I shouldnt have to worry about it not working!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This thing flat out works as advertised. Easy to set up. Has never missed a beat.<br />And I like the sound selection and the way it starts out gently and gets more persistent.
B00DJYKFXG|4.0|I feel the previous commenter's pain re getting ripped off by repackaged memories, but I'm just not sure about this one.  The version of Rag Mama Rag on disc two is different, which is to say recorded on a different night, than the one on disc four.  Four is the complete New Year's Eve concert.  The first two discs seem to be collecting material from different nights.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Nail biting exciting  surely this is not the end  I love this man's work.  I cannot wait to read more
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Reacher books are like candy. Quick and you enjoy them but no real substance. I really do like them but them are very predictable.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I'm enjoying this very much! My 'preview' is over and I'm debating whether to buy the full version.... I'm very curious as to where it goes from where I left off.
0231161166|5.0|For a reader with a basic understanding of modern biology (as simple as what are genes and proteins) and a general willingness to explore new concepts, this book strikes the right balance of level of detail and big picture on this extremely interesting new field of science.  The author further brings closer to the reader some of the key individuals behind recent discoveries rather than presenting scientific discovery happening in a vacuum.  An additional nice feature, is that epigenetics is explored not only from the developmental biology perspective, but also from the view point of diseases such as cancer and neurological ailments, as well as by looking at biology in a non-human context such as honey bees and plants.  If you have ever wondered, how it can be that humans and mice share 98% of their gene sequence or what the 90% of your DNA which does not code for proteins actually does, this book is for you.  I enjoyed it immensely.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I was having a great time with this up until i got stuck on the Runes level. Now....not fun waiting for a response. But overall thi  is number one favorable game. So far.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I am just now reading this book so cannot give a good response.  So far I am enjoying it and know it will help me in the days to come.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Cumberbatch and Freeman make a fantastic team. This modern adaptation is very enjoyable and puts a new spin on characters that I have loved for years.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I needed a dictionary on my Kindle, and this one has the name identification that I recognized and the price was right!  I continue to watch for bargains.
B00DJYKFXG|1.0|Do NOT waste your money on this...Its the same songs as Rock of Ages all wrapped up in a pretty little bow...<br />The extras are 2 Cd's of the same songs only \\"from the soundboard\\"...big freakin' deal!!..<br />and a falsley advertised \\"DVD\\" that is nothing but STILL PICTURES with the same songs playing!!<br />I repeat..NO VIDEO!!!!.....what a joke!!!..I'm returning this to Amazon and they should know this is a big rip off..<br />I already have \\"Rock of Ages\\"..if you do too don't bother paying for this piece of sh.. WAY OVERPRICED rip off!!!<br />Robbie Robertson should be ashamed for milking the legacy of this great band...GREEDHEAD!!...I'm sooooo pissed of!!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love this app! It wakes me up at the right time so I'm never late for school. I would totally recommend Alarm Clock Xtreme app.
B004PGO25O|3.0|This book is original and practical. The language is simple and engaging. This book helps to clear few self doubts which are very common with most of the people .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have never seen this on TV but my sister had the DVDs for the first season and got me hooked.  I have very much enjoyed the series.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|Finally!<br />After enduring two disappointing releases in Sleep Through The Static and To The Sea - we finally get something that's more like the Jack Johnson of old.<br />It's got some up tempo tracks and a few slower/mellower ones, but they balance out nicely.<br /><br />Now don't be thrown off by the pre-release track \\"I Got You\\", which is all right - but not the best one on this album. Give other tracks like \\"Washing Dishes\\", and \\"As I Was Saying\\" a listen since they're slightly more catchy.<br />However, I do agree with a previous reviewer that there may not be any tracks on here that are radio hits or chart climbers by any stretch.<br /><br />Still, it's a pretty good album, and a must have for any Jack Johnson fan.
B0051E9JNE|4.0|For the era it was made in an exceptional movie. Great action and some nice special effects. Great story told.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great movie in the true Star Trek definition.  Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are both terrific as is the rest of cast.
B0095T3H2U|5.0|Good movie that is perfect for a date night.  I would recommend to any couple that wanted to see a comedy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a good game my high score was fourteen thousand and one hundred and 98<br /><br />Ps I enjoy this game ALOT
B000FC130E|5.0|Another great mindbending story.  take bits of folklore and history and mix it with a good dose of reality.  And it's more than just a pretty story
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The characters are complex and the story sucks you in. The first time I read the trilogy, I couldn't put the books down (read all three in two days). I'm now rereading them so that I can absorb all of the nuances of the story. The author did a great job.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I had to keep reading, I was too worried to put the book down. It was strange but I love the end.
1444777556|5.0|So often recently, I'll read a book or see a movie, or watch a tv show, or musical or whatnot, and then think afterwards \\"eh, it was ok but I really didn't care about any of the characters, I felt detached\\".  Well this is a book where after reading it (and it's predecessor) I feel a pretty deep attachment to James and his cat Bob.  It's a very moving, and heartwarming story, and you can go on youtube and *see* James and his cat, and some of the very scenes described in the book, unfold.  Amazing!  Like others, I hope there are lots more books.  And if a movie is made, I'll be first in line to see it.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|This app is a great task manager.  Most importantly for me, it syncs with my Google Task list.  In fact, it has capabilities that Google can't handle.  This app could be improved if it allowed you to put a day's tasks in order of priority.  Instead it allows you to assign a relative level of urgency, from low to high.  It would also benefit from a calendar as some of my &quot;to dos&quot; are meetings.
B000000TDH|3.0|This album is one of my all-time favourites, so it was without any hesitation that I bought the vinyl.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the vinyl is a huge disappointment. Sonically, it sounds poor with too much noise and a lack of detail.<br />Voices sound very thin and there is a distinct lack of bass. If you ask me, it's worse than listening to a cassette tape.<br /><br />It's a far cry from the CD, which I continually enjoy playing.
B00CTT9646|4.0|The movie is great, enough said.  The special edition &#34;phaser&#34; is a piece of crap. Save your money and just get the movie. Its nothing special and feels like a cheap Chinese knockoff. I wasn't expecting movie prop quality but still this was  a disappointment
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought it, it arrived, I followed the instructions, the wheel depicting installation began turning but nothing happened.  I repeated this until it was obvious I would never get it installed.  I figured I could do better if I got a gmail address.  No matter how I tried I could not accomplish this.  It refused every attempt.  Since there is absolutely no way to contact Google I am stuck with something I cannot instal and that I reasonable no longer want.  What can I do?  Yes, it is only $35.00 but I hate being treated this way!l.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|I am so grateful for find ing and reading this book. I was coming to realize some of these things from studying Lessons In Truth by Emily Cadie' and Unity Church. How do I meet other people on this journey?
B0098G7AWS|5.0|James Cameron does it right. This movie is a staple for filmmaking and storytelling. Only film that made me cry...
B000BC8TBE|5.0|This is the essential Christmas album. Mariah rocked this album. I can listen to this album all year long. Christmas is Christmas without &#34;All I Want For Christmas Is You&#34;
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very hard,  but not so hard you warm to give up.  Love it.  Can't wait until there are more levels.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I remember watching this show in middle school and was happy to find it on DVD. Daria is a great character and classic MTV. I wish they'd bring back this show and get rid of the garbage they have now. Sarcasm and humor at its finest.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love Philippa Gregory so much and the way she writes that I have started to reread this series from start to finish I started with the White Queen, Red Queen and am now reading Lady Of The Rivers and will move on to Warwicks Daughters. And finally to The White Princess and am looking so forward to reading it. The Books are so much better then the Stars mini series.  Philippa writes to keep you in a page turning trance I really love this series and highly recommend for any one reading The White Princess to start with the first book The White Queen.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|My nephew requested these movies for his birthday. He was thrilled to replace his VHS tapes with the Blu-ray editions and loved seeing them in this format.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great Video.. you will get a awesome workout!! after my first day i tired to carry my 2 yr old son down the stairs and couldn't it gives you a great workout. you will for sure feel it the next day! so worth it.. lost 3 pds already! :) very happy about it
B00A7W29BE|2.0|Started out great on hd kindle, then everytime I open a document it stops and kicks me off. This is frustrating wish that would work like they say,not ready for the kindle fire yet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so worth the money and definetly one of the best games I ever played. It may not be as great as the PC version yet but its getting there. I can not wait for the next update and I bet neither can you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book enough that once I started, I had to read it quickly. It's rare to read a book that doesn't have a single character to like but this is that book. It will surprise and Madden you and too many other emotions to list. ENJOY!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app and I really like the updates there are two updates the first one was<br />for water and lava buckets and cake the second one was for the sun and the moon<br />and the stars and large chest. But I hate creeper and skeletons they are so annoying<br />it's mostly creeper that are annoying but skeletons are also annoying cuz there<br />ranged monsters
B00EHMG358|4.0|I loved the story, but need to get the whole book. Because I got to the part where it gets interesting and the preview was done. lol. Can't wait to finish the book.  Preston and Child do write some very interesting stories. I would recommend it.
B000RIWAYY|5.0|It's a good product in a good price for its quality. Joe Satriani met my expectations with all his biography.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I  love Mahjong, I can while away the hours on this game, and not get bored. I recommend it to any one.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It just need to cheaper or totally free to be the best one! Highly recommendable to everyone to keep all your notes connected and synchronized
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like using Kindle for Android. Easy to use and you get a wide assortment of free e-books. Downloads are simple to activate.
0811866351|5.0|The artists really outdid themselves in this book.  The level of detail is incredible.  I use it for a reference for creating my own Louisiana scenes.  Very happy with this purchase.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|i'm glad i was able to finally find the movie and at a good price. the movie was great and cute.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This one I downloaded from amazon . Played in My Glacier and am not a good player But, still liked it  . Thanks to Amazon .
020530902X|4.0|Great, but not perfect. First off any book about writing is subjective, so no book is perfect. But this one comes close. I refer back to the information in this book all the time. It is a great companion for anyone who wants to write better.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I have seen the lot of criticism of what some reviewers have posted here. The same pattern repeats. The storyline is incomplete, the cast is hollow, etc,etc. What did you expect exactly in 2 hours when a movie has to sell?<br /><br />I must say this regular version seems to be edited out of sense into a puzzle where some pieces are missing.<br />If you are going to criticize this movie criticize the editing work to begin with.<br /><br />I won't cast a complete vote until I see the extended cut but this movie has the potential to be a really good one.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is FABULOUS!!!!! I love getting to dress up all the beautiful princesses. This is a good game for little girls and teenage girls. All the dresses are gorgeous and the models are too. This is one of the best dressup games I have ever gotten. I am not exaggerating at even a little bit. Thank you so much LiBii for making this game!!! If you like dressup games at all you need to get this one! Hope this was helpful! =D
B005HSG3U6|5.0|bought this for my kindle fire 7 inch.  works great.  bought a different one for my 8.9 and it is not as good.
031623480X|5.0|Wow!  This book is very informative & interesting as it uncovers research on how foods affect our body & mind.  Dr. Perlmutter breaks down the truth about grains, carbs, fats, & SO much more!

B001UFQNF0|2.0|This car is cheaply made. Fit and finish of opening parts is very poor. Paint on car has rub marks on hood and scratches. Flux capacitor is awesome if I could see through the foggy finger printed plastic that its behind, and no it won't clean up. There is a tire that wants to keep coming loose and the car does not sit on all four wheels it wobbles like an old table. The price is not justified. Save your money and buy a solid more accurate model. Diamond Select has work to do if its meant to be a child's toy then it should be half the price. In conclusion if it is meant to be a collectors item for bttf fans (which there is probably more fans than children ending up with this item) then it should be better made.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|As long as you are patient and are willing to play and then leave and come back to play it is a good game.  It works for me as a break from work. Good graphics, free, smooth playing. You need to be willing to let it do its thing and come back.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Great book.  Great story.  I found the plot confusing at times, but it tied up all the loose ends by the end.  The main character has some Myron Bolitar attitude and cockiness, which I don't like but he is an interesting individual.  This story has lots of drama but is based on love.  It is long but worth reading.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I bought this app, and was a little skeptical at first. I really didn't expect it to work so flawlessly. I have a powerful desktop PC with multiple hard drives in it, that resides in my home office. A couple of the hard drives contain my movie collection of 400+ Blu-Ray and DVD rips, tons of TV series and several thousand music files... I'm only mentioning this because now, WITH THIS APP, I can watch or listen to any of them on my Kindle Fire HD, anywhere in the house or sitting out back on the patio. (even the bathroom!)<br /><br />I also have complete control over everything else on my computer, all from the tablet.<br /><br />I have used Windows Remote Desktop Controller on a laptop in the past. This app is very similar to that. I will go as far as to say this app is better. I purchased the Splashtop HD version without trying any of the free versions.....NO REGRETS!!!<br /><br />This is by far the best app for me. It made me go from simply \\"loving my new tablet,\\" to ABSOLUTELY LOVING THIS TABLET!!!
B00EV4EUT8|5.0|I saw this film just three days ago now. It is a movie that is still with me right now. I can't say enough great things about it. I highly recommend the movie and while it does have a few apocryphal scenes that may never have taken place in real life, the dramatic license that Daniels takes is quite understanding.<br /><br />Forest Whitaker again gives an Oscar-worthy performance. The first scene of the movie is quite shocking so I do not recommend it for women or children; it is that shocking and terrifying. To me real life violence is more terrifying than something I see in an action movie like Rambo or Die-Hard. When you see it and what subsequently happened to people at the sit-ins and Freedom Rides, you will be shocked and angered all at the same time.<br /><br />When this comes out on DVD I will be one of the first to buy it.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.<br /><br />This Is My 200th Amazon Review. Too, I'm the 21st To Have Reviewed The Movie & The Eighth Five-Star Reviewer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addictive fun I love this game and can play for hours. It is the best free game I have came across so far.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Words don't do justice to this situation. It's basically a death metal fantasy/pipe dream come to life. When the reunion shows started it was still just pillow talk, intangible ideas that fans salivate over discussing incessantly. Now 17 years after the last Carcass l.p. and even five years out from the reunion shows, Surgical Steel is here. If there is any doubt in any mind as to what Carcass may have left or if there even is a need for Carcass anymore, all one needs to do is listen to the first five tracks here and marvel at the remarkable feat provided by one of the all time greats in Extreme Metal history.<br /> This album packs all eras of Carcass on to one finely honed disc and pushes things even further into the future. It's become standard for us to hear new bands translating the Carcass sound into their own molds. But to listen to the originals do it, it becomes immediately apparent which band does it best. The production is excellent, sounding both brutally heavy and natural. Nods to Slayer and Death as well as that fiery, bluesy, lead work by Bill Steer are the absolute driving force of the album and to say the Death Metal community has missed him, is a supreme understatement. The contributions of new drummer Dan Wilding are incredibly intricate, groovy, and pay a small homage to Ken Owen's style which is the only way this reunion could have worked so well. Jeff Walker snarls and rasps his way through 11 tracks of political, biological, and existential disdain like it was 1993 all over again and his bass playing really augments the faster drumming and guitar playing and completes Carcass.<br /> There is absolutely no reason not to buy this now. Don't steal it, buy it. Let's show the bloated stagnant Billboard charts that Extreme Metal fans support our favorite groups to the death. As filthy and repugnant as they've ever been, Carcass are masters once again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and addicting I've been playing it for a while now. I enjoy playing it. It's fun and entertaining. Very detailed.
B004WR125O|5.0|I needed this to control my receiver from the other end of the house from my iphone which can only be done via wifi and not bluetooth.  It worked great when I used automatic setup.  Manual WiFi setup didn't work at all.  I tested the control of the unit from my iphone  this morning and it works great
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|This game sucks I had thought it would be good but it's way to hard gameloft you screwed up on this one. If you don't have like 5 med kits it's nearly impossible to beet some missions. The cover system sucks if you try to move he runs right off of the cover.
0316223239|5.0|Well written, excellent and somewhat chilling story, especially in light of what unfolded in Cleveland with the three young women who were held prisoner for so many years.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Don't read anything about this book, nothing more. But go ahead and read it, and you will be both moved and entertained.
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|I'd heard that the even movies are great and the odd ones suck.<br /><br />Well, now I've seen the first four and I can say that the even movies are definitely great, but the odds ones don't suck. If you like TOS, you'll like The Motion Picture.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|The book is a quick read that does a great job sharing a lot of information and getting you excited about the potential of DevOps!  The writing can be a bit hokey at times as mentioned in some of the other reviews, but all in all it is a compelling story.  It could've gone a bit further into some of the solutions, but it is a great handbook in terms of giving you a high level overview and introducing many concepts and other authors to further your education on the topic.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Just watch it. For realsies. The cinematography is just as beautiful as 2009 and so is the writing. If you've seen TOS, you'll appreciate some of the references. If you haven't, you'll still be able to follow along and enjoy yourself.<br /><br />Unless you hate camera flare. Then you should probably not watch this film as you'll spend most of it as a giant squid of unbridled anger.
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|I actually forgot how good this movie was until I watched it again.  It's a nice story with some great characters plus streaming had nice enough sound and video quality.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|Lockout is a sci-fi action/thriller co-written and produced by Luc Besson, the man who gave us The Transporter, The Fifth Element and Leon: The Professional, and tells the story of a convicted CIA agent (Guy Pearce) who must break into a maximum security prison in space to rescue the daughter (Maggie Grace) of the President of the United States. There isn't much to the story, which has been done before in different ways, but this sci-fi version and action-fueled adrenaline rush is great. Directed by Stephen Saint Leger & James Mather, Lockout is a good, fun and intense thrill ride.<br /><br />The directing is good, but nothing award-winning. The look of it is more like a Stephen Sommers-film mixed with Die Hard; dark, well-paced and fun. Guy Pearce was just amazing as Snow, a CIA operative who's betrayed by the government and framed for the murder of his friend, another undercover CIA agent. Snow is rude, obnoxious and off-the-wall, but that helps give his character the creative juices to make this movie stand out. Otherwise, we'd have just a Live Free or Die Hard knock-off. Maggie Grace was really good as Emilie Warnock, the daughter of the president. The visual effects for the movie were great, given that it was very low-budget ($20 million). Sure, they're nothing compared to that of Prometheus, Elysium, Oblivion or the really massive sci-fi movies, but they're still damn good. The script, again, nothing really new here but a refreshing look back on some old action classics mixed in with some new characters and details. The thing with this movie, though, is that there can be another, even though there isn't much story material to work with. It could be more focused on the character of Snow, who I would have to say acts kind of like a futuristic Jack Sparrow, of sorts.<br /><br />Lockout is a fun, ridiculous sci-fi action movie that deserves to be a part of any action-fan's collection, especially for Guy Pearce's great performance. Pearce needs more leading roles anyway, or at least ones like Lockout, where he gets to kick butt and destroy pretty much everything.<br /><br />4/5 Stars****

B0031RS2HC|4.0|My first Reacher book and I really enjoyed it. It is not deep or meaningful, the support characters are a little one dimensional but it was just a good ripping yarn.<br /><br />Reacher is a complex character and totally unbelievable in a good way. Reminds me a lot of Jack Ryan from Tom Clancy without or the awkward emotion and back story that Clancy felt compelled to include.<br /><br />The twists were telegraphed from many pages before they happen which would be my only major criticism. There was no real suspense build for the climax and no twist (that you can't see coming) to make it entirely satisfactory. However it is a true page turner, easy read and just enjoy the ride.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I skipped the first part of the book and read only the second part that deals with Tesla. Very interesting and informative stuff but Tesla is almost a saint to the author, so the book ends up like a hagiography and not a well balanced biography. Still worth reading anyway.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This app works great onhmy Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet but wont let me view my textbooks on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.

B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Have you ever gone years without seeing an old friend, then you run into them and it's like no time has passed at all?  You fall comfortably back into the old routines and rituals of friendship as easily as writing your own name, as if time had no power over the strength of a true bond, a real connection.  Listening to the new Carcass is sort of like that for me.  I haven't seen my friend in over a decade, and so many new friends have come and gone since then.  And none of it matters a bit.  Those years in between have seemingly not even happened.  The conversation is familiar, but my old friend seems to have gained a hell of a lot with age.<br /><br />The new Carcass smokes.  Period.  Everything a metal fan could ask for and more.  Majestic, soaring NWOBHM melodies.  Scorching grind/death metal with precision blast beats.  Blazing thrash metal in the finest 90's tradition.  A wide array of both face-melting and melodic solos.  Throat-scraping growls from Jeff Walker as viciously wicked as ever.  Puzzling, disturbing song titles and lyrics.  Ah, welcome back to my headphones, Carcass.<br /><br />This album flows right along with ridiculously perfect pacing.  I don't know if I've ever listened to a metal album with more of a perfect balance between speed, brutality, melody, and riffing.  The musicianship and songwriting are beyond reproach, and to that end, the album seems to have been written and recorded with obvious knowledge of a masterpiece-in-the-making.  After listening to it about ten times, I'm beginning to think of it as the \\"Rust In Peace\\" of extreme metal.<br /><br />Every fan will have their own favorites, but for pure thrash/grindcore mayhem, you won't find better songs than \\"Thrasher's Abattoir\\", \\"The Master Butcher's Apron\\", or \\"Captive Bolt Pistol\\".  On the melodic end, I can't, can't, can't get enough of \\"The Granulating Dark Satanic Mills\\".  And for an exact demonstration of how to play flawless thrash, look no further than a track that had to be mentioned for both its high quality and catchy title, \\"Noncompliance to ASTM F 899-12 Standard\\".  Did I mention how glad I am to see my old friend?<br /><br />Without question, Carcass have entered the conversation for Album of the Year.  You'll be hearing a lot about \\"Surgical Steel\\" before 2013 is out.entioned for both its high quality and catchy title, \\"Noncompliance to ASTM F 899-12 Standard\\".

0316056898|5.0|Laughed, cried, snorted and woke my husband countless of times to read him &#34;just this one part.&#34; Read it in a weekend and wish it were longer. Great read for any bossy pants!
B006GLMHBM|5.0|I always love me some Sex and the City!! Sexy and provocative and never disappoints. I highly recommend this show!
B00B49GSOS|4.0|Good movie prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Good blend of computer generated graphics and actual background visual effects. Nice adaption from the book.
0802473156|5.0|I bought this on audible.com and have listened to it multiple times. I gained so much from listening just the first time, so I bought the book through amazon.com for my husband and he has now gone through it more than once. We are newlyweds so we are using Dr. Chapman's techniques as much as possible and refer back when necessary Totally worth the buy!.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is great. It has everything all on one page. The clock reminds me of ny grandfathers old bed clock.lol
0307474275|5.0|If you are not GROUNDED you can be shaken with the REVELATION given in this BOOK. I visited FRANCE two years ago so I was not only able to relate to all of the fantastic DETAILS given of the Louvre Museum and  the Eiffel Tower but I was totally fascinated by the wealth of knowledge communicated.  I will take Napoleon's word away from this mind bending Novel which states that HISTORY is written by the Victor. No truer words have been spoken.  I particularly marvelled at the fact that a polio ridden individual could be so goal absorbed, manipulative and diabolical.  A life long lesson learnt from his fiendish scheming.  Some may say it is only a NOVEL but all TRUTH is parallel. I have learnt.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So amazingly beautiful yet sad at the same time. Brought tears to my eyes. The Book Thief stole my heart.
B00E6890RG|5.0|With a year of great prog releases of veterans like Steven Wilson's The Raven That Refused to Sing (and other stories), Dream Theater's upcoming self-titled (heard it via streaming), and what I have heard so far from the first Fates Warning release in a long time, and from newer bands like TesseracT's Altered State, I am glad to hear more great prog being released. And by this, I was surprised. I am not going to do a track by track because that simply just doesn't do this album justice. It's an album to listen through, to take in, and enjoy the ride. There is a perfect mix of heavy, soft, symphonic, and melodic elements. Ross executes the best vocals yet, showing more range than he has in the past two releases, and the instrumentals are tight, skilled, yet immersing. Whether you have listened to them since their debut or you just stumbled upon this album, you owe it to yourself to buy this and sit down, put on a nice pair of headphones, lay back, and take a journey with this exceptional album. With this, Haken has shown their potential to possibly become legends.
B00F3HMWSI|5.0|There is really nothing that I can say about Aphex Twin that hasn't already been said, so I'll make this short.<br />Richard D. James' most well-received album is (my opinion) a true classic in electronic music; a series of songs that helped lay the foundation for easier-listening music along with artists such as the Orb at a time when Electronic music was though to be all mindless. Without this album, there would be no Moby, no Deep House, no easy-listening electronic music in general. Eccentric to say? A bit, but musical taste is subjective, and out of all of the artists that I've listened to, Aphex Twin is the only one that stands out as his own genre - he really is a genius. This album has gained a statues worthy of all of the work it's accomplished, for the groundwork it's laid. Xtal still sends shivers down my spine. If you like electronic music at all, this needs to be an addition to your collection. It certainly changed the way I look at music; not just the type made with synthesizers and drums, but as a whole. A legendary record that will stand the test of time.
B00181MHQU|5.0|Classic remake of Romeo and Juliette. Rita Moreno is a serious talent! Why can't we all just get along. Watch it!
B008469DGY|3.0|It is fun but not that easy to control without multiple attempts on each hole.<br />The graphics are great and enjoyable.
0920668364|5.0|This was a book I frequently read to my children as they grew up.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon and immediately sent it to my daughter so she could share it with her son while he grows up!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Growing up I was a DC fanboy, I followed the stories of the Justice League, Batman, and the Teen Titans with a religious fervor. I enjoyed the occasional spidey story every once in awhile, but it was the DC rack that always got my attention first.<br /><br />These days I am now a Marvel addict. DC has fallen to the wayside, a shell of its former self. Movies like the the Avengers, and all their other super hero movies has set Marvel up as the premiere tellers of the super hero story, the standard of which all other super hero movies will be judged by.<br /><br />This movie is awesome. The actions sequences are perfectly tuned to be exciting at the right moments, to evoke that \\"hell yeah!\\" response that makes you smile. The humor is spot-on, with several laugh out loud scenes. Is it perfect? No, but no movie is.<br /><br />But is it the perfect popcorn-munching, watch-with-anyone sort of movie? Hell yes it is.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I am enjoying the game so far, however I don't like the social media connection.  I don't want to post on facebook or follow on twitter, this should be optional not mandatory.
B0049J3RBC|5.0|This is one of our families all time favorite animated movies.  Great graphics.  Great story line.  A movie the entire family can enjoy over and over again.

0553801473|1.0|Okay.  I have read many of the \\"most helpful\\" reviews, just to see how other people responded to this book and I think that they pretty much cover the bases.<br /><br />To put it simply, this book was incredibly boring.  I got to the point where I was entirely zoned out and entire pages would go by where I would have no idea what had happened.  I'd skim back over them to see if I missed anything, but I never did because in 99.9% of the book, nothing notable happened.  People mention that he uses annoying phrases over and over.  I was annoyed at first too...but then, I just started skimming.  I was pretty much surprised I had finished, because there was very little build up to the conclusion of the book and no feeling of \\"oh no, it can't end now! No! No! No!\\" which I experienced with the first three.<br /><br />I also think that his writing style is so lazy.  Fluffy sentences that really tell you very little and stupid cliffhangers seem to have replaced thought, plot development, and effort on the part of the author.  I enjoyed the first three books.  I started to get a glazed, out of focus feeling reading the fourth, but this book was the worst.  I had hoped for a return of interest to the story but found instead a continuation of monotony from the last installment.  Characters who were interesting, self sufficient, \\"realistic\\" or at least rounded to some degree become stupid, dull, and repetitive.  I feel like you can read 1/4 chapters for each character and pretty much get their entire story and suffer through a lot less whining (Tyrion, Dany) and tedium (Jon, Dany, a million side characters we hope never to see again).<br /><br />I don't recommend that you buy this book.  I recommend, if you read it, that you borrow it from a friend or a library.  If you don't want to commit hours of your life (which you will never get back, by the way) to reading this snoozer, read a plot summary and you will get all of the main points of interest and can look those parts up inthe book if they interest you.<br /><br />And really, if you think this book is worth five stars isn't it worth a review that shows that you actually READ this book? I am sorry if my review was boring and repetitive.  Just think of it as a warm up for A Dance with Dragons.

B009G41CG2|5.0|Never knew what Mahjong was until I got my Kindle HD.<br />Now I can't stop playing it.  Even if you solve the same puzzle<br />a second time, you never make the same plays.  Great for<br />killing time at the Dr.'s office.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I like it. It swivels but it is very stiff to move. No place for a stylus. Colors were right on. Inside is nice suede feel to it. I would love it if it weren't $40+ and rotated more smoothly. It's a quality product so I felt it was better than any of the other options out there. Worth the money I paid I guess.
B0090X4GJE|3.0|I bought this in the MP3 format.  To me, I was hoping for more.  I wanted<br />something different.  However I like less songs on this album.  I like<br />I Need Your Love (which I hear on the radio more and more), My Blood,<br />Don't Say A Word, and Anything Could Happen.  The tone and sound of these<br />songs seem to me that they sound the same as the songs on her previous<br />album Lights.  Maybe it's me, but if you like her, you need to try this<br />album or borrow from a friend.

0307743659|4.0|I felt the compulsory need to revisit the Shining before its sequel came chopping its way through my door. Memorable movie moments were missing from the book and vice-versa. Having armed myself only with a previous movie viewing, the book remained fresh; moments I were expecting never appeared and moments I did not expect scared the s*** out of me.<br /><br />The differences between movie and book were surprising. Gone were the twins, the bloody elevator, and even the ax. In came the wasps, the topiaries, and the explosion! I felt the focus on Danny's shining was more prevalent in the book, which I believe sets up the book's sequel quite well.<br /><br />I've never read King's earlier works; having read his three most current books, the improvement of his writing clearly shows in comparison to this book, three decades of age. Even advice that he offered in his own memoir on the craft is often ignored. There are adverbs aplenty and descriptive elements that cease the plot. The most glaring example of plot-halt came in the climax; just when all hell began to break loose, we were taken back to a re-explanation of something that happened two hundred pages prior. Thankfully, King has been daily practicing his craft since The Shining's original release. I have high hopes for the sequel that it will have crisp writing and a sharp plot.<br /><br />Despite the yellowed pages the Shining remains quite healthy. Sure, there are elements no longer found in King's writing; gone are the days of paragraph splitting parentheticals and adverb filled expositions. I'm still unsure where on the King timeline his garrulous use of pages hits--it seems random. Even in his modern writing, Joyland came in trim and fit, while Under the Dome weighed in bloated, 200 pages overweight. The Shining remains a strong contender despite showing about one hundred pages of saggy, over-winded narrative.<br /><br />What preserves a favorable rating is the high-tension closing act. Everything wrapped together and exploded--literally--with me quickly turning the pages to consume more. I'm confident that King is one of the few writers able to pull this off with such effectiveness. Bravo to Sai King for creating such an excellent story and for whetting my appetite for more.her and exploded--literally--with me quickly turning the pages to consume more.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Buttons are big and easy touch. Graphics are large enough as to be easily read. Basic calculator functions. I use it when I help with concessions because it is so much easier to read then the little ones that are in the cash box. Still trying to figure out what the 'plus' is in the title which is why I only gave it 4 stars, if it's more  than a basic calculator it needs to have better information but if it just means it's a great little calculator I agree that's a plus.

B004CURZFC|5.0|The movie was a good movie of good versus evil.  My kids wanted to watch a movie and I chose this one because I thought my husband would enjoy it too.  I was right, he enjoyed the action and nobility in the movie.
0440246318|2.0|There is nothing like a Lee Child's Jack Reacher audiobook to alleviate the boredom of a long car ride, unless it's novel number 17: A Wanted Man.  Ready by Dick Hill, A Wanted Man was almost as monotonous as a 13 hour car trip.<br /><br />Former Army MP and now nomad, Jack Reacher, is trying to travel to Virginia when he gets picked up while hitchhiking in Nebraska. In the car are two men and a woman, and they give Reacher a bogus story about traveling home from a work-related event.  But it doesn't take long for Reacher to guess that the car situation is not what it appears and that there maybe be at least one hostage in the car.  The driver picks up Reacher, hoping that it will be easier to get through roadblocks.  I thought that the entire novel was going to take place in the car, and it was slow.  When things finally got moving in the second half, the plot was convoluted and totally unbelievable.<br /><br />When an author writes a book every year, some are bound to be better than others.  We plan on listening to Lee Child's latest novel, Never Go Back, on our return trip home and we hope that this one is more engaging than A Wanted Man.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I ordered this device when I read that you can stream local media files using the Fling app but that's no longer true. The last update from Google is blocking local media playback. Although Google have said that the move is not intentional and they would \\"like\\" to support local playback. I think they caved under pressure form RIAA and such. I'll return the unit for now and may buy it again if this matter ever get cleared up.

B00DWZHTOU|4.0|Sometimes, I watch movies and there are parts that drag. I think okay, I am still going to watch to the end but let's go with it. This was not one of those movies. The movie starts out with a few minutes of each of the Four Horsemen's signature tricks. Then they move on to meeting and the then the viewer is watching the main event tricks. These tricks have people who have had hard times getting money. Who doesn't love that? There is a big trick in Vegas, New Orleans and New York. Then a surprise ending. All the while Morgan Freeman is trying to expose the tricks. Pretty good entertainment for two hours.
006114665X|5.0|As many other amazon reviewers have pointed out, Christopher Clark's book on the origins of World War I is a marvelous read and a deeply researched piece of scholarship with well thought-out conclusions. The book masterfully accounts for the dizzying variety of tangible and intangible factors that made the political situation among the European powers so complex and dangerous in 1914. Clark also effectively attacks some of the most sacred cows of World War I historiography, including the Fischer thesis that sees German paranoia and imperial ambitions as the main culprit, but also the contention that England was threatened by German naval rearmament, or the claim that Austria-Hungary was a doomed empire that sooner or later would have collapsed anyway. The author also notes that historians have now conclusively debunked the idea that Europeans welcomed the war enthusiastically. One can certainly argue with all of Clark's conclusions--as some reviewers here have done--but one cannot dismiss them. This Cambridge University professor has done his homework well.<br /><br />My one gripe with the book is that Clark seems to shy away from taking the evidence he presents to its logical conclusion. In the often-quoted conclusion to the book, Clark argues that World War I is not an Agatha Christie novel where in the end we find the culprit with the smoking gun in his hand (actually, there is an Agatha Christie novel that makes for an appropriate comparison--\\"Murder in the Orient Express.\\" I will avoid a spoiler though). I read the book differently, for I see Clark identifying two main culprits: French president Henry Poincare and Russian foreign minister Sergei Sazonov. Clark's account of Poincare's July 20-23 visit to Russia is nothing but chilling. The French and Russian diplomats appear positively giddy at the prospect of a full-scale war they were ready to hang on Germany and A-H. Poincare on this occasion brazenly refused to even consider the possibility that A-H's inquiry into Franz Ferdinand's assassination might find evidence for Serbian involvement (which of course was very real). As early as July 28, as the Germans were still hoping for last-minute diplomacy, Poincare already concluded: \\"No, there can be no settlement. There can be no arrangement\\" (p. 503). Similarly, Sazonov refused to even recognize that A-H had been wronged. Russia mobilized first, therefore triggering the fateful chain of events that led into disaster. As Clark shows, Poincare went so far as to later destroy evidence from his own diaries, and the Russian government backdated the Austrian mobilization order by three days in their official history of the war in order to give the appearance that Russian mobilization had been a response to Austrian action (p. 509), rather than the escalation that it was. I find it hard to escape the conclusion that among the many factors that contributed to the catastrophe of World War I, here we can identify the two main culprits.<br /><br />None of this is to deny the catastrophic misjudgments, ambitions, and weaknesses among the other actors. In the end, I find the story of 1914 still to be a tragedy above else. Clark's book will not end the debate, but it will be hard to top this book as the most even-handed, comprehensive, and readable account of the origins of the First World War.
B00EEN7CAK|2.0|This movie is like watching paint dry. It moves painfully slow as if they did not have enough of a movie so they put it on slow motion. The teens use google Earth to find celebrity houses and social media to track when they will out of town. How many times can a person watch these teen girls and the one boy go through closets. Dang! I would have had a better time sitting in my own closet. In one scene there is a long shot of the house they are robbing. There is very little music if any and the viewer sees them running from room to room. The scene went on way too long. The characters aren't even interesting. Emma Watson's character is so irritating. The real girl had an E reality show for awhile. She was irritating as well. So, good job Emma but people have better things to do with their time than watch this. The hundred and one club scenes that filled the movie were just that filler. Thin plot so fill up the movie with closets, selfies, and club scenes. This whole movie could have been done in 30 minutes, tops. Each teen got a search warrant served. That could have been one scene. Maybe a quick run through of clips but not the same scene played out over and over again. The court scene is done with all the teens together. There was no actual court. It was them getting their picture taken walking in and walking out of the courtroom.

B00271DNP4|5.0|I waited to see all of the films before reading the books to avoid being disappointed. I loved the entire film series. After reading the first two books I was impressed how similar the movies were to the books. However, this book had a lot of differences, which I thought almost made it a different story for me. I loved it. Great job! Great book! Great series! I will miss looking forward to future movies and books about these characters, which I have grown to love.
B000FC2L1Y|3.0|I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I am shamelessly in love with the story of Claire & Jamie Fraser. This book certainly takes us beyond the central love narrative and inserts now the perils of time travel for Bree & Rodger. On one hand, I've read reviews that suggest Bree' s character is rather dull, if not seemingly \\"stupid.\\" I disagree. I truly enjoyed--if not relished--the interactions between Bree and her father. my only complaint with Gabaldon' s writing style is that she wastes words. I often find myself skipping page after page for the mere realization that some things ARE predictable. I will certainly,  keep reading the  series, but I feel as though the long, drawn out scenes are almost too much to bear! I keep wishing I was as entranced with the story as much as I.was ion book one. Oh, and some plot twists are so ridiculous they get on my nerves. Otherwise, I know I would've scored this book higher than a three out of five stars.
B001L9OKZK|5.0|This was one of my favorite stories as a kid. Before I was able to read, my mother used to tell me about it, while she read it. I was glad when I was old enough and able to read it myself. I absolutely loved it. I even loved the animated movie that was made, although that was nowhere nearly as good as the book. Still, it made me happy to see on television what I had imagined as a child.

B00BUADSMQ|1.0|In every film outing of John McClane, the archetypal everyman hero, he has been a man set against impossible odds against enemies that are far more intelligent, more clever, and much better armed... at least on the surface. But because of Bruce Willis's portrayal of McClane's heart and soul, his wit and humor, and his never-say-die attitude, he has prevailed against these odds and these evil people, initially threatening a building, then an airport, then a whole city, and then a nation. But now it's time for John McClane to go on vacation. Unfortunately for him, it's to Russia to bail out his \\"criminal\\" son (Jai Courtney of SPARTACUS and JACK REACHER, and was quite good in both, but not so much here).<br /><br />And unfortunately for us, this little vacation abroad proves that the DIE HARD franchise has outlived its usefulness as both a successful franchise in both a monetary and artistic sense as director John Moore (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, the 2006 OMEN remake, MAX PAYNE) creates easily one of the worst films of the year and certainly the worst film (and stupidest title) of this once-revered franchise with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.<br /><br />The shark was somewhat jumped when John McClane and his slacker/hacker sidekick had to save the US of A from super-cyberterrorism in the Len Wiseman-helmed LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, but it's still an effective and entertaining film (with the exception of the McClane vs. Jet Fighter sequence). But with GOOD DAY, the film is a series of one ridiculous action sequence after another that effectively destroys EVERYTHING lovable and relatable about John McClane. Sure, McClane has a few decent quips and still is his weary self, but he is now elevated to a status of God-like proportions, plowing through cars and blowing away bad guys in a foreign country without consequences and falling from great heights through wooden catwalks with barely a scratch. This was once a man who, before jumping off the roof of a 40-story building with only a fire hose tied around him to support him, took a moment for a prayer (\\"Oh, God, please don't let me die!\\"). He knew he was human. He knew he was fallible. And these are faults and weaknesses that have stayed with him for most of the films, but now, he's willing to jump through windows, assured he will land and still live because he has become invincible. This is NOT John McClane.<br /><br />This is not just the fault of Willis, who is clearly just cashing a check here as he sleepwalks through this film, and it's not just the fault of the writer Skip Woods (whose previous credits include a slew of sub-par actioners like SWORDFISH, X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, THE A-TEAM and HITMAN), and it's not just the fault of director Moore, who has shown throughout his career that he's very satisfied with creating films that more closely resemble open-air video games than films that have any hint of decent plotting or style or understanding of character. This is a failure on an institutional level. Fox Studios has a very proud history of taking once-great genre franchises and turning them to intolerable garbage (see ALIEN, PREDATOR, STAR WARS, etc.), and this is only the latest. And as long as we keep giving them money for these films, they will continue to release them.<br /><br />The rest is up to the audience now. Do yourself a favor and don't buy into the positive reviews here. I can certainly understand and appreciate seeing and loving a film that has almost as many negative reviews as positive, because certain films are meant to be polarizing. But here with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, this is supposed to be mass entertainment that appeals to everyone. It's not meant to challenge your ideology or to shake up the status quo of the industry. It's supposed to be an entertaining night out at the movies. Sadly, it's anything but mass entertainment. This is lowest-common-denominator garbage and doesn't deserve your time, let alone your money.hose tied around him to support him, took a moment for a prayer (\\"Oh, God, please don't let me die!\\").

B002W7J3SO|4.0|Love old movies and what used to be &#34;cutting edge&#34;. I mainly watched this for the music. I think it has a great movie score and never took the time to actually watch the movie.<br /><br />I like it. Will probably watch it again.
B00915G6MG|5.0|If I had to nit pick it would be that some of the amazing stories seem to have been condensed to fit the time slot and not progress at the right pace - what that means is I'd love more episodes :)<br /><br />If you like NCIS you'll like this season, the cliffhanger is suitably &#34;oh my you cannot leave me a year before I know what happens&#34;
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great 3D visual effects and a pretty good show overall.  If you are a follower of the Star Trek legacy tho' you might get confused with the events in the time sequence. You'll have to see the movie and decide for yourself.  Still a pretty entertaining evening of supermen and super feats.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|The product picture i am looking at RIGHT NOW has a push/pull setup, so, of course that's what i thought i was getting. If i had known it was one fan i'd have gotten the EVO and another fan for IT. But rather than make a huge fuss i'll get another fan for this and play nice.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Pretty good remake of the original.  Blu-ray edition is worth the repurchase from the DVD. After watching the 3-D disc I thought it was too dark in several places so stick with the Blu-ray and you won't be disappointed.  Soundtrack was a big update.

Pop it in in get in to it and so help me, got so distracted at how bad that Hank was acting I held one towel through entire movie! Noticed at the end my mouth was opened. I have to say, Hank shocked me! Not in a good way! He sucked!

B008YKRRI6|5.0|.  The Testament discs in black covers, primarily #s 2,7 and 9.  Testament did not issue  a Philharmonia Orchestra # 3 and 6,, but there is a good Royal Danish Eroica on Testament (see my review) and a live Berlin PO Pastoral(which I have not heard).  On the whole I prefer these black cover Testaments.  Most superior are #s 2 and 7. They are most energized and exciting.  The superiority of the Testament #7 to the EMI version is astonishing, even considering K's bi-polarity.  I also prefer the Testament #2 to the excellent Berlin RSO version from EMI. Both improve upon the PO version. #s 1,4,5,and 8 on Testament I also consider more valuable, but by smaller margins. The two Testament #9s a equally superb, and are among K's greatest Beethoven performances,  The overtures contain comparable virtues: extraordinary clarity, idiosyncratic LVB mood extremes, prominent winds, brass and tympani spotlighted more than most conductors without distortion (mostly the opposite, e.g. the tympani in both #9s). Overall Klemperer exhibits profound insight.  Of competing sets, I value most those of Eugen Jochum (Philips  and DG), George Szell (Sony), William Steinberg (Command), and Bernard Haitink/RCOA/Philips. And there are great readings of individual symphonies in non-sets and in complete ser (e.g the Kleibers, Munch #7, Bohm BPO #4 and VPO #6, Van Beinum #2, Kubelik IPO #4 et al.

B002ECJZ76|5.0|I have read the reviews and I can totally understand some of the negative comments as the bulk of them are based in subjective feelings.  Not everyone is tolerant of a dubbed movie.  Some have said the movie is sad and muddled.  The character of Santa as we know him is a phenomenal man who dedicates his life to the happiness of others.  This would have to be a man of extraordinary strength and compassion.  As the saying goes, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  The main character suffers through some tremendously difficult situations and comes out on the other side a strong good-hearted man.  As for the ending that some people seem to not understand, why are you wanting an explanation for a man in a sleigh flying across the sky being pulled by four flying reindeer?  There simply is NO explanation that can be given for that.  I took it to imply that the spirit of Christmas, that of love and giving, lives on in all our hearts.  My personal feeling is that he wasn't really physically there, but rather, his spirit was lingering and affecting the memories of all whom he touched.  I think this is a great movie that offers the viewer a chance to watch a version of Santa's origin that is not based in magic or fairy tales.  This is based in the kind heart of a good man who just wanted to make people happy.  Is it entirely believable?  No, not for those who will tear it apart wanting facts and figures to prove every theory.  But it certainly offers a very human quality to the legend for those who just want to experience a warm holiday smile.

It's easy to learn and it lets you build at a fast rate without you having to buy coins, etc. The graphics are amazing and there is no lag whatsoever. One of the surprises I enjoy is the funny banter between the characters. This is one of the best apps out there for creating your own little town. Can't believe it's a free app but glad it is.

B00D7D3OQE|4.0|performances.  One truly legendary effort, barely equaled but not eclipsed, is the Beethoven Missa Solemnis.  Soloists gave career<br />psformances, especially Waldemar Kmenntt and Marga Hoffgen- both surprised in re vocal attractiveness and exprssive intensity.<br />Perhaps the primarily ensemble nature of the vocal work helped, but no soloist earns less than five starts, and both Soderstrom<br /><br />and Crass are major assets.  Klemperer encounters no tempi problems, while his customarily extreme clarity allows one<br />to grasp this difficult colossus with more ease and appreciation than in most other interpretations.<br />Messiah also posseses clarity and grandeur. Hines and Hoffman, I think are attractive soloists.  Schwarzkopf was caught a bit<br />too late c.f, Donath, Ameling, and Heather Harper.  Klemperer again captures the grandeur and epic nature of the score. I do find some tempi too slow, which is at least problematic in the two Bach works.  Neither is as static as Klemperer's very late Cosi<br />Fan Tutte, but both require a quicker pace fairly often.  Of the soloists, I warm most to Baker, Prey, and Crass in the<br />B Minor Mass .Fischer Dieskau, Ludwig, Berry, and Pears in the St Matthew Passion.  Schwarzkopf is better here than in Messiah<br /><br />Peers: Missa Solemnis: Bohm/DG/two versions; Jochum/RCOA/Philips, Shaw/Telarc<br />  Messiah: Marriner/Ameling/Decca; Donath/Richter/DG, Janowitz/Richter/DG (in German), Harper/Davis/Philips<br />  B Minor Mass: Jochum/EMI and Philips; Shaw/RCA and Telard; Richter/Stadee/DG; Munchinger/Decca<br />  St. Mattthew: Richter/Archiv/(2 versions; Jochum/RCOA/Philips; Gonnenwein/EMI; Munchunger/Decca; Solti/Decca
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Watching this, especially in 3D, you feel totally transported to an alien planet in far-off space. I liked the film in the theater, and having it in my home collection is wonderful. And the 3 and a half-hour documentary about making the film reveals so much more.
0307476073|5.0|Could not put it down. She had so much courage to do what she did. The book is well written and would advise everyone to read it.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|So before I begin, this is just a movie and nobody really dies. Opinions are not deadly and mine won't kill anyone. That said, I have a real problem with this film, the whole reboot and the last few Star Trek movies in general.<br /><br />First the movie. It was successful and is maybe the highest grossing Star Trek movie in the series (though not in the US and maybe due to higher ticket prices). That does not mean it was a good film, just an entertaining one. Good for the studio for delivering what the public wants. But in this case it seems the public wants very little. The recipe goes like this, some attractive and currently popular actors, an action filled storyline than has them flaunting the establishment and achieving success against overwhelming odds. 10 minutes of plot, an hour and a half of soon to be forgotten breathtaking special effects. The TV episode that spawned this movie had more depth.<br /><br />Overlooking the simple fact that the original this is based on, The Wrath of Khan, was a much better film, (it was probably the best of all the Star Trek films so no shame there), there is the same stupid script elements that the last film had that could easily have been fixed to make this a better movie. Did anyone wince at one of the final scenes where Kirk, among very sensitive technology, adjusted the engine energy sources by kicking it in place. I'm sure that final kick was just the precision adjustment the mechanism needed. It's with the same sledge hammer precision that the whole movie is constructed.<br /><br />But rather than dwelling on every little plot misstep or mistake, I would like to discuss a greater problem. There are a lot of space opera movies and series out there. There was really only one thing that made Star Trek unique and that was Roddenberry's vision on a hopeful future in which humans had finally learned to get along in a society of true equality. It was during the late sixties when Star Trek was born. There was the war in Vietnam (much worse than Afghanistan and Iraq)that had this country divided and calling returning servicemen \\"Baby Burners\\". Our troops returning home from a hell you can't imagine were not celebrated but spat upon. There was a draft that saw worried parents bidding their sons farewell. There was a crisis of belief in our democratic way of life as very public officials were caught doing illegal things. There was rioting on campuses by disenchanted students. Civil rights leaders were being killed and the middle east started it's first oil embargo.<br /><br />It was during this setting that Roddenberry launched a series about the future that told us that there was a future that held hope. That we would solve these problems and go on to a bright future. And the episodes had us encountering new life forms and solving their problems with our unique human perspective that we had so painfully evolved into after so many years of trials and tribulations. Roddenberry offered us a vision of our future that spawned hope and provoked thought. He had ground breaking episodes like one showing the absurdity of racism where the two antagonists were half black and white but on different sides of their faces. Their legacy from this racial hatred was a world in ruins.<br /><br />While there is nothing wrong with Into Darkness as an entertainment piece, it's a shame that so much of it's pedigree and uniqueness has been stripped down to this derivative and mindless eye candy form of entertainment.<br /><br />At some point while I was watching the endless special effects that took the place of storyline I felt I was in another movie, Idiocracy, and I was watching the film that won the Academy Award in that movie. I hate to think that Idiocracy's vision of the future is the one that comes true.

Had swollen finger, toes. Every thing is normal now. He trim, doesn't go to a gym or exercise a lot. I hope it works as well for me.
0062255657|2.0|I am a long time fan of Neil Gaiman, Neverwhere and American Gods are two of my favorite books.  I bought this for my mother who read it first and told me she felt a bit confused, so I read it and while I am not \\"confused,\\" I am also not totally sold or satisfied.<br /><br />The writing, as usual, is wonderful, descriptive, haunting and gripping. The story is fantastical and I can see the plot elements that make it a book for adults, but it doesn't read like an adult novel.<br /><br />I will admit, by the end of the book  it felt like a dream to me - the kind of dream that is fleeting when you awake, you try hard to hold onto it, but the details of it drift and blend and you are left with that unsettling feeling of knowing a story but not truly remembering it or understanding it. Perhaps that was Gaiman's intent.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed meeting the Hempstocks and would love to read and learn more about Lettie.  I also would have liked to know what truly became of our 7 year old, now as an adult - what his life is like now and how those situations may have impacted his journey.  It just left me a bit unsatisfied and it was not what I expected from this author.

B00E018T9Y|1.0|I mistakenly purchased this title believing it was the Kindle version of the actual book.  IT IS NOT.  This is essentially a 3 page summary of the book.  It is worthless!  Zero stars.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|When this movie was released in theaters, I went to see it. I became weepy, and overwhelmed with happiness, right when it began. (This was a first for me) Great performances, just like the first film. (Save for Eric Banna, my ONLY casting complaint about the previous Star Trek film) Chris Pine just 'gets' Kirk so completely, it's a beautiful thing to witness. Relationships are taken further, that's all I can say.
B005NFYXTG|3.0|I like the extras in this set, but also I like Pasolini for his capacity to, in my ability to comprehend, invoke the gist energy of what time he interprets.  I can name a few other effectives, and though I've only seen four of his films, I trust seeing the others again and again.<br /><br />This movie, set at the end of oppressive times in the 20th century dopo la guerra del mondo due, I would call allegorical because it appears to represent oppression, seemingly of a sexual nature, confinement, or enforced sexuality during or at the end of a time in history where such events were exposed, but really to me, it is the progression of a generation shown in an event.  That is special, I think.<br /><br />A Generation may say: \\"As youths and young adults we had these SENSATIONS (key), we suffered, we grew old, shorter, beautiful strangely torturous.  Perhaps rejected, we wore furs, were glamorous, that is, we moved up in the world, and therefore - relieved, able to breathe at last - we raised our children a certain way.  De Sade inspired in Pasolini the fecal nature, the nutty substance (artful too in this case), but I was raised by people born in the teens and 20s, lived through that time, saw their reactions, and therefore have a concept of such connotation, which for a child who hears \\"Boy, what you doing in that bathroom, so long,  reply \\"s***'\\" --- LAUGHTER from the elders - is heartwarming and memorable.  That is only a view, my view because I was very young compared to them, only 3 or 4 years old, certainly not much more, and they were my best friends in the world.  I hated to say goodbye. That may be because they accepted me.  Allegory, but also other elements in storytelling and filmaking are included.  Pasolini was interested in those on the \\"MARGINS OF SOCIETY\\", those who accept people, live for life because they must, and even the least useful stuff bears room for glamourization.  I may have touched on too much, but that's my point.<br /><br />We all have terrible flaws and we pay the price in one way or another, but I saw them pass on.  In my interpretation of this movie, limited as it may be compared to a talented filmaker, or other decvoted professional -- came from my life.  I like this movie, and I think I understood connotations beyond de Sade's influence.  This movie makes me remember people who are not among us now in influence and even in the flesh.<br /><br />So, I highly suggest it!rible flaws and we pay the price in one way or another, but I saw them pass on.

B00CKR63F2|5.0|This is a very well written coming of age/female adventure story set in the context of a Native American legend. The characters feel wonderfully dimensional and real. There is a rich texture interwoven into the narrative that lulls you into the story and keeps you delightfully cocooned as you read. I like the direction the plot went in: there was always some new obstacle for the protagonist and things move along at a nice pace. The dialogue is great and the scenes between the heroine and her grandmother at the start of the book are poignant and moving. A remarkable feat of the imagination. I look forward to more books by this author.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|- Why I bought this?<br />I bought the Chromecast to stream Youtube and other videos to the TV, replacing my old method of connecting my laptop (and making the laptop useless while it streams).<br /><br />- What I think of it so far?<br />After placing my order for this on the day it launched and receiving it about a month later, I can say it was well worth the wait! Playing videos for my kids on their TVs from my Nexus 7 while still being able to use my tablet is amazing. It takes about 5 minutes to set up and is really easy to use.<br /><br />- What operating systems I have used this on?<br />I have used my Chromecast on Ubuntu 13.04 (64 bit) and on Linux Mint 15 (32-bit). To do this all you need is to install Google Chrome Web Browser and install the Chromecast Extension. It is very easy and simple to use on any device, such as phone or tablet. My Nexus 7 while streaming also does not lag at all or display any signs of a hiccup or sluggish performance.<br /><br />- Why you should buy this?<br />Because it does exactly what it is described to do! The product is not the end all to video streaming, but it is a great alternative and at only $35 the cost makes the purchase a no brainer. If you want to free up device usage (or rather non-usage) due to streaming, such as a laptop, definitely buy one of these.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|My husband and I kept hearing reviews and excerpts from the series but we did not want to start watching mid-stream. Ordered the first 3 seasons and after the first episode we were hooked. Can not wait for Jan 5th for fourth season to start!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Im a fan of musicals, what can I say? I really liked this drama packed show. Great story line, but I think they came at the first season too fast, too furious. So much drama, what does it leave for the next season?  (I will start it tomorrow, so I will let you know)<br />I enjoyed how the writers brought out the personalities of the characters; you love some, you hate some... perfect (I actually found myself wanting to throw something at Dev and Ivy in the last couple of episodes) Fow a show to bring out emotion in a viewer!! Amazing.<br />You can say what you want about Ms. McPhee, but she nailed every episode; this is truly her niche.<br />-this is one of those series you have to watch from the beginning though; you can't just watch one episode and skip some, then come back. You {should} watch it in sequence, but since I watched the first season twice over thus far, thats not an issue for me.<br />Overall, this was an awesome drama. I stream it on my iPad as I'm on the elliptical (makes the hour go by fast).
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Very tricky to play, but a good way to pass time! Also, a fun way to entertain the kids. I would recommend it, minus all the ads of course!

Plus you can mine, defend yourself from zombies, creepers, skeletons, and spiders , grow crops, go to the nether, and you can even connect with your friends ( well with the help of wi-fi access ) So I think that minecraft pocket edition is a very good game and I advise it to you it is worth the $6.00
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Gave this set as a gift to someone who just had surgery and could not get out of bed for awhile.  With the first episode I saw a very sick patient laughing and enjoying watching the show.  Great gift!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I always enjoy unique story lines and this book has one......a great example of not judging someone different without knowing their story.  And how people become who they are...
B000SVZIOE|5.0|This movie is totally charming. My kids love it, and it's one of the few children's movies which don't involve the terrifying plot point of being lost, or losing parents. There are a couple scenes with the villain of the movie which can be scary for small children, but they are short and soon overcome by the &#34;good guys&#34;.<br /><br />The humor is acceptable and funny to even young children, while still being entertaining for adults. At about the 4th or 5th viewing it is decidedly less charming for adults, but the kids still love it. The use of Rube Goldberg devices as transportation and robots dancing the robot are creative and interesting.<br /><br />Definitely a movie worth checking out.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Great for what I needed in everyday use. Large numbers and easy to use.  Very satisfied with this app. GREAT!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Loved the whole series.  It's rare that sequels are any good, but 3 sequels, I say they were all awesome.

1400032717|1.0|I was diagnosed with Aspergers when I was 12 and I have to say that this book is by no means an accurate portrayal of an Aspie.<br />I have never met anyone with Aspergers who reacts the way the main character does and I think it's sad that many people think that this is a good portrait of an aspie's way of looking at the world.<br />This book for me was just a collection of stereotypes and I felt like the author just checked the Wikipedia entry for AS and decided to create a character that embodied all the symptoms and characteristics described there without any further research.<br />Having Aspergers does NOT make you a math genius or completely clueless about human emotions. I am also not afraid to take the train, but books like this are the source of comments like \\"Oh... You cannot possibly have Aspergers... You are waaaay to normal.\\"<br />The author must also believe that any random Asian can help him with his maths, simply because they are Asians...

B007U1FEJE|4.0|The Beach Boys haven't skipped a beat or missed a step when it comes to writing beautiful California-style ballads and beach-combing oceanic love songs.

0761172726|2.0|The surface is not nice for writing on. I must use a felt tipped pen and would prefer to use pencil as events and memos change often in our house.<br /><br />The lay out is OK, the stickers not great. Would rather have more occasions and school events and less character stickers.
B00DG86ARK|5.0|Great setting, great band, great cinematography, beautiful setting! What more can you ask for? Sound is great and the band is in fine form as well. Orchestra adds depth and texture to the mix filling out the sound nicely. After seeing them live at a local club, which was a dive with horrible acoustics and a terrible house-sound guy, this was a real treat. Just know that there is no 5.1 mix, but the lpcm mix is quite incredible. Also, the concert is 2hrs 20min. Bonus video of an acoustic set performed at the Union chapel adds another dimension, showing that no matter how small the setting, the emotional impact of this soul touching music comes through. Cannot reccomend enough!
B00D5LC4GY|1.0|Simple puzzles, the pieces are basically aligned around the board where they should be placed. It's just dragging the pieces onto the board. Now, I find that apparently there is no way to uninstall it. Still waiting on a response from customer service. I won't be installing any more apps from the Amazon app store!
B00AA0TZTW|1.0|One of the worst music purchases I have ever made.  If you enjoy the music of Jimi Hendrix, do not-- repeat NOT-- buy this crap.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Just to add to the list of 5 star reviews here, I just gotta say that this movie ruled. The 3D is the best I've ever seen. But it's not just visual gimmicks; the movie is well-paced and just gritty enough to illustrate its world without being a parody of itself.<br /><br />I've heard some people voice their dislike that Judge Dredd is a boring character; one-dimensional. My view is, there's more to him under the helmet. I have often thought about becoming a police officer. There is a struggle inside, a struggle between being yourself and obeying your animal needs, or, sacrificing your ego, and devoting yourself to a code, so that you can help others and keep what's left of your society intact. That's who I think Dredd is. And I think they portrayed him well.<br /><br />Here's some minor spoilers to add to my analysis: When Dredd has to stun those two kids who pull guns on him, I could really hear the concern and sincerity when he leaped to the side and yelled, \\"Stun!\\" before he put those kids out for a bit. Urban threw in compassion into that line. Also, when it's all over, and he's asked what happened, all he says is, \\"Drug bust.\\" As if it were just another day. I love it. Little things like that make a big character like Dredd, and I don't think he gets enough credit.<br /><br />The music is also awesome and noteworthy. It's pulsing and carries the film well. The futuristic setting, while not as wacky as the original comics, is still fresh and realistic; I can picture it happening.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that I love like a great album. If I'm hanging out at my apartment and just need something on, I'll just put it on, and inevitably get drawn into it. We need more movies like this these days, to balance out the over-the-top-with-meticulous-CGI, ADD explosion-fests, a la Michael Bay's Transformers movies. So, here we have a tight, well-paced action/sci-fi flick that will be up there with the ranks of RoboCop, The Terminator, and other 80's classics. Nothing is superfluous, and everything is perfect.<br /><br />Here's my part to help make a sequel. 5 Stars. Thanks, guys.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I had high expectations when I purchased this gadget.  I installed it and...poof...it was a dud.  The streaming sucked big time, with buffering all the time; I could only get two Internet sites (Netflix and something else); the quality was awful; there was zero reason for me to keep it, especially as I have a PS2 player and can get full access to the Internet.<br /><br />The most disappointing aspect of this was that Google produced it.  I expect only quality products from Google; they've really failed on this one.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|If you are a fan of Carcass, Surgical Steel is, without question, a \\"must have\\".  After seventeen years (yeah, nearly TWO DECADES), Jeff Walker, Bill Steer, and company are back in such proper form that it seems like they had never left.  They bring the tasty shredding riffs and eerie/awesome solos that we all love.  This material is as fresh and as biting as everything else they gave us so long ago.<br /><br />When some bands return after a hiatus, they are just trying to recapture an old era, and the resultant music is tired and watered down.  Surgical Steel is NOT that kind of comeback.  All of the aggression that you expect is packed in there, with Jeff Walker's signature vocals and even Bill Steer's ore-crushing vocals accent the songs here and there.  Their new drummer, while he isn't the same style as Ken Owen, does a fantastic job, and his playing might give the music a bit of an extra edge because his playing style is a bit more aggressive overall.<br /><br />Like others have said, they blend the styles that they developed on each of the albums over their career very well in Surgical Steel.  It is absolutely one of the best metal albums, and you should probably stop reading my review so that you can buy it and hear it for yourself!
0812982622|5.0|Fabulous - best I've read in years. Gripping weird compelling and maybe not so far from reality as one might think - unbelievable and then again maybe not
B00DPY95D6|5.0|I must admit that it wasn't me that purchased this book, it was my daughter.  I picked up her Kindle over the weekend just to see what she'd been reading and Cult of Mirrors caught my eye.  So I decided to have a look.  Well I just could NOT PUT IT DOWN.  What an unexpected treat!!  From a legal thriller to the bizarre after affects of bath salts, this story line runs the gambit.  You have no idea what's going to happen next!!  And it's NEVER WHAT YOU EXPECT!!  If you love roller coasters, you WILL LOVE CULT of MIRRORS!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought for my grandson and ending up reading. Will probably read the next one or maybe the prequel. Hope the movie captures what I saw as I was reading
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I loved Jonathan Safran Foer's other books, so I bought &#34;Eating Animals&#34; without knowing what it was about.  Like the author, I have also &#34;flirted&#34; with vegetarianism.  The book was very engaging, but at times I actually put it down to cry.  I had seen a film about the meat industry, but that didn't bring the information into my consciousness the way this book did.  I will never forget what I read, and am now a true vegetarian.  I thank Foer for writing this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a must read series! If you like the fifty shades of grey, you will LOVE the crossfire novels! I can not wait until the next book(s) come out.
B009UNGYHG|1.0|Waste of money. Charges one in ten attempts.  Took a trip and didn't charge even when the charger was fully charged.  Waste of money. Need refund / replacement
B009LDD54K|5.0|Awesome love this show+game of thrones+Vikings+justified+hell on wheels+copper+sons of anarchy can't watch normal tv programmes any more production and writing of these shows is unsurpassed
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I haven't yet finished this book but am enjoying it very much.  The author does an incrediable job of merging three differant groups of people to bring them together.  A great read thus far.  I only wish I didn't have all of my other responsibilities so I could read the book in one setting (it is that good).
B00AEFXXMI|4.0|Feeling down? Old? Locked into your humdrum life with no escape? Kick back, relax, laugh and enjoy this hillarious romp down freedom road.  It will entertain and lift your spirits.
B002PZJMU2|3.0|Simon Baker was a scene stealer in The Guardian, but the Mentalist simply does not give him the vehicle in which to shine.  It's a cop show that's simply OK.  It's a shame as the premise is strong but the show does not go deep enough.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game is just a good time waster but any little kid who left car horses would prompt find this to be fun
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Adele has one of the best voices today.  Beautiful intro and then she hits those notes like nobodies busness.  Loved the way the Bond &#34;music&#34; was used also.  Very inventive!
1939416019|4.0|The story line in this book is quite good. The character development throughout the series has progressed since the release of this book. It's all in all a good book but it has its flaws. The books are filled with grammatical errors and sometimes the transition between characters story lines can be a bit sluggish. The whole series has kept me entertained and I'm always waiting for the next book to come out. I'll just have to keep on hoping that the author will get more people to proofread his work.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Wonderful production - great singing and the stage was amazing!  Loved the ending especially but was disappointed that the original phanton didn't sing with the original Christine
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|As musician myself I give It 5 stars. And not just because Im a musician as well but because I have a lot of respect for all the artists featured and/or mentioned in the film. Theyve paved the way for aspiring musicians today and have brought music to a place of many different genres. Some of which were created right there in sound city from the depths of that magical board that is now owned by dave groll. I just hope that he is sharing that magnificent piece of equipment for other new artists who are trying to make a name for themselves. Its amazing that thing has been able to last for so long so it needs to be shared. All in all, great movie and really cool to how a lot of my favorite records were created.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I had been looking for a while for a light to use in case of power outage.  I looked at several different ones and this one fit the bill with not only a good price, but output of lumens was great.  I highly recommend this for an emergency light.
B005OP2928|5.0|Even better than the last season.  Gosh they are SO funny!  Lily is talking more which is GREAT, and Gloria gets to be even more sassy.  Love the progression of the families.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|It puts some levity to our current world, with all that our military personnel have to face on a daily bases.  God Bless our real Joe's!

B00CLD65X0|5.0|addicting. but hated how episode 9 ended. Can't believe Mary is finely happy to have it all come crashing down.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The G930 offers good audio quality either if you are listening to music, watching movies or playing games.<br />  It is definitely better than the steelseries 7H, which I had before this.<br />It has good base for a headset and you can reduce or increase the bass level from Logitech gaming software easily.<br /><br />The microphone is perfect, at least with skype or teamspeak. Your voice sounds realistic and there usually ain't any static noises.<br />Muting the mic is easy, push the mute button or simply just push the microphone in the up positions and it mutes automatically.<br /><br />The range of G930 is about 10 - 15 meters, but you have to stand still at those distances. Going down-, upstairs reduces dramatically the range.<br />  I have a two storied house and it works everywhere ( the computer and the receiver is upstairs), yet i have to be still in<br />  downstairs.<br />the battery of the device is pretty mediocore about 7-9 hours of gaming or watching movies.<br /><br />At start the headset were really uncomfortable until i found the right extension ( level 9) and now i can hardly feel them even i have eye glasses. Having eye glasses reduces my options with headsets, cause some of them are really uncomfortable with glasses, 7H was. Anyway I usually play/be on PC about 6-11 hours a day and have no problems with my ears, glasses etc.<br /><br />Overall the Logitech G930 headset is good for a gamer who wants excellent quality with a reasonably low price.<br /><br />4.9/5<br />I recommend this product.

B008JGSM6G|1.0|Not a game to the adult or intellectually minded.  I thought it would be more challenging than it is, it appears to be more designed for small children who are working on their spatial skills.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This would be a good movie if you were trippin on acid. Looks like that is what it was made for.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|It's an okay game...not very competitive tho.  It's fun for when you need to just relax and/or are tired and just want something to &#34;win&#34; easily at.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Well acted..very well written (very clever) and awesome ending!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I've only seen this movie about 50 times.  It is a great classic.  It was never meant to be but it is a great love story.  But why would any real woman go with Lazlo when Rick is there?<br />And Claude Rains performance is incredible.  The perfect corrupt official.<br />Madeleine LeBeau is the only actor still alive.  She was Rick's ex-girlfriend who started dating a Nazi and then remembered she was a French patriot.<br />Great movie.  If you haven't seen it, your film education isn't complete.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Great movie. Great buying experience. Would be willing to purchase more movies like I did this one and will recommend this route to movie seeking friends.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I love this book and have read it several times.  I cannot believe that I was 40 something when I finally discovered the awesome Ms. Austen.  Pride and Prejudice is so tight and every time, you just can't wait for his disasterous proposal and the subsequent series of events.  If you have no patience, just see the very fabulous and faithful BBC version starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennett.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|Other than about 5 different scenes and probably less than 15 minutes of the movie. I found it rickety, faint, debile, halt, nerveless, sapless, halting, crippled, weakly, feeble, gimpy, infirm, decrepit, game, weak. Choose your Synonym . . .
B000IKM8UM|2.0|Wasn't worth the money.  Spike Lee could've done better than this.  Denzel was okay, but Wesley Snipes' performance was better.  Also, Spike should have stayed out of this movie.  He was absolutely horrible.

B001O53BK6|5.0|I love rock and roll and this story about a middle-aged rocker was well done. Humorous, good music and a great story line.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|About 50 years ago I read this book and remember really liking it a lot, so when I recently received a Kindle as a gift, I decided to revisit it.  I think I loved it more now than I did then.  Some of the vocabulary, being the writing of the time, is a little difficult but you don't even really have to look up the words to get the idea being expressed.  Once I got to a certain point, I had to finish it.  It really is one of those romances and adventures that is a timeless treasure.  By the way, my husband tried watching a movie version of it one evening and I left the room, the entire first part of the book was missing.  Moral of the story, if you really like the book, don't watch the movie.  It just doesn't translate.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Loved this show for a long time, but it's been a while since I've seen it. Started watching again back to back episodes.

B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Brilliant physics challenge,  with a pleasantly colorfull interface that is nicely mixed with cool music. Sugar used as a main ingredient in anything is a plus.
B00F4FGC0S|4.0|What can you say about such a creative band like MGMT? Well three albums in, they continue to flex their musical muscles and deliver an album that is different from the previous one.  When [[ASIN:B0037W68F4 Congratulations]] materialized as the follow-up to [[ASIN:B0010VD7EO Oracular Spectacular]], there were plenty of skeptics off-put by the sophomore affair.  2013 effort [[ASIN:B00DMEQP46 MGMT]] doesn't incite such an outcry as the band have firmly established themselves as an experimental unit who are content to rewrite their past.  This is not the formula for commercial endeavors perhaps, but does speak to the band's artistry.<br /><br />MGMT is filled with plenty of 'goodies' for the receptive, open-minded listener.  Opener \\"Alien Days\\" seems very head-scratching from a first listen, but give the child-singing featured cut a couple of spins and it's brilliant magic finally opens up itself.  \\"Cool Song No. 2\\" its follow-up has the lofty task to follow-up the thoughtful opener, but easily accomplishes the task fueled by it's dark, poetic lyrics and a touch of piano for color.  The catchy \\"Mystery Disease\\" still eschews an outright chorus, but latches due to the multiple iterations of the titular line.  \\"Introspection\\" follows more nonchalantly, feeling a bit less notable than \\"Alien Days\\", \\"Cool Song No. 2\\" or \\"Mystery Disease\\".  However, a touch of religious skepticism (aka atheistic references) tends to always propel alternative music, with the eyebrow raising lyric about prophets (\\"...why have all the prophets lied?\\")  doing just that.  Throw in the optimistic sounding pessimistic lyrical \\"Your Life Is  A Lie\\" and MGMT continues to be the gift that keeps on giving.<br /><br />\\"A Good Sadness\\" continues the consistency, though the cut may grow a bit too dense and overindulgent for some, sounding more like a soundscape as apposed to a song by the close.  \\"Astro-Mancy\\" is busy sounding as well, but its hard to deny the craft of the synthetic layers and the driving, ubiquity of the groove from the onset.  The eerie \\"I Love You Too, Death\\" restores any lost momentum, even if the restoration of 'faith' is questionable (\\"Generations of defeat / always assuming you're the worst...\\").  Penultimate track \\"Plenty of Girls In The Sea\\" isn't bad and benefits from catchiness, but to some extent almost feels 'too standard' for MGMT.  \\"An Orphan of Fortune\\" closes solidly, but not quite as notably as \\"Alien Days\\" opened.<br /><br />Overall verdict? It's good news as [[ASIN:B00DMEQP46 MGMT]] is another fine addition to both MGMT's discography as well as alternative rock in 2013.  The best album of the year? Nah, but a very good one worth checking out for sure. 4 stars.g, ubiquity of the groove from the onset.

B00DYFCYSO|4.0|Seeing the incredibly gifted John Legend bow so modestly on the Billboard Charts with his fourth solo LP [[ASIN:B00DYFCYSO Love in the Future]] (his first solo effort in five years) was very disappointing.  In an age where R&B has cooled off tremendously, artists like John Legend only come ever so often.  Regardless of underperforming commercially, Love in the Future is nothing short of a fine R&B album.  Most impressive is that Legend never compromises his soulfulness nor his personality just to conform to 2013. It isn't without moments that could've been more exciting mind you, but the delivery more often than not is stunning.<br /><br />There are plenty of highlights, with the first being \\"The Beginning\\", which seems to detail the seriousness of the relationship of which Legend sings.  Already onto producing offspring, \\"The Beginning\\" seems a bit 'quick out the gate' where narrative progression is concerned, but the songwriting and overall execution is undeniable.  He follows up the genuine opener with a solid cover of \\"Open Your Eyes\\".  While the cut is not a Legend co-write/original, he performs it at a lofty level.  The trio of \\"Made to Love\\", \\"Who Do We Think We Are?\\" and \\"All of Me\\" is where much of the 'meat' lies in Love in the Future.  \\"Made To Love\\" is both classically soulful yet forward thinking, accentuated by contributions by alt-pop singer Kimbra.  \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\" is throwback at its best, with some swag added by the ubiquitous Rick Ross.  Contrasting Ross's money-based rhymes is the \\"Ordinary People\\" rival \\"All of Me\\", co-written by standout songwriter Toby Gad.  On \\"All of Me\\", Legend singing with his piano is him at his best.<br /><br />The brief \\"Hold On Longer\\" is no throwaway, still finding Legend getting the most out of those gospel-drenched vocals.  \\"Save The Night\\" adds quite the addictive groove, which instantly has the listener nodding.  For those turned off by the hip-hop sensibility of the beat, the pianistic lines erase all doubt that Legend has eschewed the soul.  The Dr. John sampling \\"Tomorrow\\" further cements Legend's love of the classics and his goal to still keep the 'soul' in R&B, even if neo-soul has long faded.  The rest of the album continues to show John doing what he does best, totally putting his soulful stamp on it.  \\"Dreams\\" may lack some songwriting depth, but Legend atones with his pipes as he floats through, literally like the 'dreams' of which he sings.  \\"Angel\\" featuring Stacey Barthe could've lasted longer, but as teasing as the minute and a half performance is,  Legend still provides more than enough to 'whet the palate'.  Moments like \\"You & I (Nobody in the World)\\" and \\"Caught Up\\" truly showcase just how in love the recently married Legend is... very much so.<br /><br />Ultimately, [[ASIN:B00DYFCYSO Love in the Future]] is more thinking about the 'future' as far as the success of the committed relationship as opposed to its musical endeavors.  Sure, Legend walks the thin line between contemporary and retro very well, but one listen tells you where Legend's heart and influences lie - the past.  Personally, why should it be any other way? Legend is one of the few artists who has a skill set to capably channel the golden days of R&B. Why shouldn't he? 4 stars.ubt that Legend has eschewed the soul.

This author is exceptionally talented at his craft and this will be one of the highest reviews I have given to date, or might possibly ever deliver!  A very emotional book, but one that while sad, also allows you to appreciate how lucky you are in your own life.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|A little over the top even for a comic book-based film - I thought the Iron Man films were done much better although Ironman's character in this film seemed cliche and dull, smart-alecky to the point of being annoying
B008JFUO4U|3.0|There were good special effects, sound and picture. The movie was very predicable. After viewing the movie I did not feel much of anything even with the $15,000 surround system.
B007NR9WBG|4.0|Writers Rubin, Stitzel and Messina take the premise of recording a person's full sensory experience and explore all (and I mean all) the implications of such a technological breakthrough.<br />Under Douglas Trumbull's directing, this 1983 classic has withstood the test of time.<br />And Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood do a superb job as a couple whose marriage is on the rocks. Separate from but complementary to the scientific aspects of the film, their relationship problems draw you in meaningfully.<br />Supposedly Natalie Wood passed away before completing her parts in this film but you would never know it, as the continuity is seamless and all the consequences of the theme are fully and satisfactorily portrayed.<br />This excellent film gets my vote for one of the top ten SciFi movies of all time.

034580404X|5.0|This series of books was very interesting but had sad parts also.  It was erotic and somewhat informing for the somewhat uninformed or the less adventurous.  It told the story of an abused boy and his growth into a healthy but nonconformist relationship with a naïve but willing woman who changed his outlook on life and his sexuality.  It was very entertaining but thought provoking.  A very good read.

B00BCX2F66|4.0|This is a great looking case and does what it is supposed to do. The flip feature works well.  There are a few things that I have noticed about the case might cause problems.<br /><br />1) The back of the case is smooth leather when new. There is no scoring or crease. While this looks nice, it doesn't give the case a clean line to fold on. Over time the back of the case develops a somewhat straight crease from using the flip feature. This might not bother some, but was a bit off putting to me. I like things nice and neat.<br /><br />2) Due to the flip feature, the phone does not sit in the case as securely as others. My wife has the Poetic Atmosphere and her phone is very securely seated in the case. I am somewhat concerned that if the phone was dropped that it might slip out of the case and get damaged.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|Viewers of STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS will probably fall into three categories: those who love it, those who hate it, and those who have very mixed feelings about it. And there will probably be many reasons for this, although one of the major reasons will be the degree of affection and loyalty a viewer feels for the original series and the movies that included the original cast members, especially THE WRATH OF KHAN.<br /><br />To me, one of the few \\"bright spots\\" in this often lame action film was the brief cameo appearance of Leonard Nimoy as Old Spock talking with Young Spock. To me and to several fellow Trekkies who are between 50 and 80, the original characters, played by the original cast, had great \\"charm\\" and \\"warmth.\\" This new cast, to us, for the most part is cartoony and is doing a moderately competent parody of the originals. Try as some of us do, we just can't buy their performances, can't take them seriously, because they haven't grown on us over a series of years, even decades. And if any were to die - as we thought Spock had \\"really\\" died in THE WRATH OF KHAN - we would not feel real grief and sorrow and pity for these newbies, as we did for the original Spock and Kirk and the others.<br /><br />Watching this film, I felt \\"removed\\" from it emotionally; it was a visual and intellectual experience with all the \\"caring\\" about the characters drained out. I could appreciate the \\"cleverness\\" of several special effects and several allusions the original series, and I could bet myself that X or Y or Z would be the way the script-writer would get the characters out of predicaments A, B, and C ... and 95 percent of the time I guessed right, which made me feel \\"smart\\" but also disappointed me that the script was so weak that even I (in my mid-70s) could predict virtually every plot twist at least ten minutes in advance.<br /><br />In the last half of this film, I sensed that parts of one major confrontation were deliberately parallel to recent and current Hawk-vs.-Dove foreign policy disputes in the U.S., and I was disappointed by the stereotyped shallowness and blatant dishonesty of one of those sides in this film. While I agreed with the point being made, I wished the characters had been given more depth and better lines - and that the \\"solution\\" had been more imaginative than the violent beat-down killing we see.<br /><br />I viewed STAR TREK: IN DARKNESS with a very disgusted Trekkie who thought this film was a \\"desecration\\" of the \\"already perfect\\" Khan story and who, at the end, rated it \\"F-\\".

0061992860|5.0|It's a great book and while I'm not quite sure what's different compared to the older edition, it seems to have everything you'd need to survive.  Bear in mind though, it's probably a good idea to practice some of the things it teaches instead of just hoping you can figure it out when you need it.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I rleally like this app. Is fancy, easy to use, great information. Help me keep updated and know new thing of any sector.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This book is so heart warming and interesting. For anyone who lives animals, this is a must read.... And it makes you feel good.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|This movie was scary until you finally catch a glimpse of &#34;Mama.&#34; Her character is so fake looking that we were actually laughing. It made it un-believable and ruined the movie.
B000GCFY0I|1.0|It was a boring start an I couldn't really jump into the book I wish it got more in debt and make me be in the character
B00DU74U74|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the book, but this doesn't follow it very closely. I was so mesmerized by the book, and the movie was a flop in my opinion.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|Not very intuitive application. It could me better user friendly designed.<br />I would like better ability to customize the layout.<br /> Not much advantage over the web ui
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!! Totally fangirled over this! Great plot! I really strongly recommend this!!! Definitely a favorite!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Awesome.  Love the show altogether.  Walter is a trip.  Good quality video.  No issues streaming on Amazon. Thanks so much!
B005LHOKFS|4.0|If you are accustomed to TripAdvisor online, this is an nice abbreviated version.  Gets quick answers and had ample info for me to work comfortably on my tablet.
B00F2362IE|5.0|really cool game nice graphics and its challenging really fun the game is a keeper the game is worth every penny I spent
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I wish it was a true story-it is so believable & good. To read the preview I wouldn't really automatically assume it would be that interesting, but he is such a good writer that it hooks you from the beginning!
B00CATSONE|3.0|Book is ok if you are up to lite reading, it's easy to understand and doesn't use complicated words; I will say it's ideal for young people. It speaks vaguely about achievements and breakthroughs
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|A great movie but even better on Blu Ray. This is a real classic which has lasted the time and looks even better after being restored.
B005LAII4E|5.0|This second GI movie is so good but sad why did they have to kill off one of the best actors
B001PP9ALY|2.0|If it weren't for Angelina and her naked backside pose, the whole film would be totally worthless. It was terrible, really terrible. Put a curve on a bullet and shoot around something, what a crock. That was the end of the movie right there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very good game that I can not seem to put down. I am addicted to this game.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This is a great second movie in this new series. Just as good as the first one. Perfect casting on these movies. Can't wait for the next one!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|As a long-time science fiction and fantasy reader, with hundreds if not thousands of books on my shelves (physical and virtual), I wanted to add my vote to say that this is a stunning debut.  I'd put this right up there with the initial works Patrick Rothfuss, Peter Brett, and George Martin.  I can only hope that Anthony Ryan (this author) doesn't fall victim to the same success issues that plagued those three (inability to produce more, writing the same story again and again from different perspectives, and stretching out the never-ending story until it turns into a soap opera, respectively).<br /><br />This book is rousing, dark, sad, and inspiring.  It's a complex work that's easy to read.  Another reviewer complained that the foreshadowing \\"hooks\\" (some of which have yet to be resolved) were bothersome, but I liked them.  They add to swirl of speculation that the reader experiences even while reading a straightforward battle scene ... and with good reason.  There are many surprising twists, even as the overall arc of the story progresses as you know/hope it must.<br /><br />I appreciate that Ryan added depth to his characters without degenerating into trivial, banal conversations.  David Weber started with a great premise in his Safehold series, but it completely degenerated into boring soap opera.  So far, Ryan has ideas, imagination, plot twists, characterization, emotions, and more.<br /><br />I've written a number of fairly negative reviews on Amazon, so it's nice to be able to write one that's unequivocally positive.  If you like a story of the somewhat flawed but basically awesome hero as he progresses from childhood training to acting on the  tragic world stage, you'll love Blood Song.  I'll be buying copies for my friends.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Much better than I expected and than most of TV series i have watched! A lot of drama and quite interesting.
140006922X|2.0|The author is a scholar of religions. Otherwise he could not have assembled the vast material he uses in this book.  He also has a masters of fine arts in fiction, and, he is also a professor of creative writing. This book well demonstrates his ability in creative writing and fiction.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is truly inspiring! Read this book not only for you but with your family for your family. I have a 10 yr old son who is my life, my light and my everything. Reading this book with him is a time period I spent with him that will embrace for all time. Please, please read this book and absorb all that is has to offer.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|If you don't mind that the leading character is simply a foil for all the others and, frankly, pretty wishy-washy, this soapy story is okay. But neither the dialogue nor the skimpy historical context (other than some descriptions of the food) manage to tranport me to the antebellum south. I did race to the finish to see what would happen -- and story is, after all, important -- but that wasn't enough to make it a truly engaging read for me. Then, the ending was disappointingly anticlimactic.<br /><br />Again, to the dialogue: Topping off other less egregious language anachronisms toward the end of the book was when a character talked about asking for somebody's \\"input.\\" Grated on my nerves. Where are the copy editors these days?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It such a good game if your a my little pony fan this is the best game ever you need to play this game .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great brain teasers that test your logic and problem-solving abilities!  Graphics are clear and puzzles range in complexity.  Can't wait for more rooms!
B00DAXXO98|4.0|This is the best story/show. Kevin Spacey is excellent. The back water workings of Washington. I believe this<br />is close to the truth to what happens. Plot excellent. Next episode (3) should be exciting.
B00F88H5K2|1.0|This video has been censored so that we don't see images of Liberace's penis, or Thorsen's.  These have been discussed in the media, but buyers of this video won't be able to join in the conversation.  It is the film Soderberg made, and not Amazon's gentility, that I wanted to purchase.

1579129129|5.0|This book is beautifully photographed and very well written.  It's filled with really great information.  I'll certainly keep this one around.  It's also a great reference for understanding the different animal skulls for the creation of artwork.  Very well done.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I am a big fan of the movie and the game is just as good<br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|It is very useful.  I look up everything from movies and who starred in them, to current events. Even Google recommends you to Wikipedia.
B005TPCR2U|5.0|Great romantic movie. I recommended to anyone who still beleive in love and a great story. The movie takes you places you don't expect.
B002M9WW30|1.0|I bought the set from WalMart and took them home and found that half do not work..  I returned it, thinking it might be a fluke, only to find out the 2nd set did the same thing..  I REALLY wanted this bad, and severely disappointed..  WHY would you do this to Rocky????  DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!
B000I9WWHW|5.0|Great Movie, great family flick to watch, althgouht stars a bit rough it gets better. It is a bit goofy, but that is what you expect from Robin Williams

B0064X7FVE|1.0|It's hard to navigate ever sense they changed things around on the app. I don't like it all, it seems to be more about other things than what it supposed to be about, which is weather! Hence the name on the app. Change it back to the old way
B00BKRON5K|5.0|the minute I started reading this I thought of all the sense it made. and as soon as I put it into practice I noticed major differences especially in my performance in the gym whilst training. It makes sense, it has history on it's side and afterall this is how we are supposed to be eating anyway!

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I LOVED the first edition and this one is cool too but they need to add more guns to the game. But other than that great app, a must get.
B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|This book was way too wordy and the plot was predictable.  It was also difficult to follow in spots because it jumped around.  It was mostly about the heroine's thoughts.
B009AY04A8|5.0|They do play a mean game of hide and seek! Enjoy a variety of mini games that change just as you think. you've got it all figured out.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Dog not have to come here to get apps! It usually takes forever to load this specific website!<br />Great app.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|A great book to start the series really gets you stuck in the story! Could not put it down until i finished the book and continued to buy every book a great series!

1847879071|5.0|It was what I needed for my class and affordable. It was in good condition too, so I am happy with my purchase.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Star Trek?<br />I know Star Trek, sir, and you are no Star Trek!<br />I watched Star Trek with my Dad and my Brother when I was young. I saw all the movies, the television shows like Next Generation, Voyager, Enterprise which makes me sad to experience this.<br />This is like a Hunger Games future (unique and outrageous fashion sense) collided with a star trek/tokyo drift spoof took over or started their own intergalactic agency not for exploration though. It is an alternative to a high school education that you get to travel on a star ship and play grab @## with the universe. But of course there is the plot sprinkling from The Wrath of Khan for nostalgia and to give a semblance of a story line because you run out of colors to paint the people on the funky colored worlds after a while. That and it begs the question is this the pinnacle and illustrious branch of society supported by all making one feel safe in your hover bed at night knowing that huge quantities of frivolous resource wasting adrenaline junkies are standing guard? No, it's more like a remake of a classic rock tune during which the original band takes the stage and then proceeds to take a whizz whilst spinning in a circular pattern like a planetary orbit (Star Trek Into Darkness Spoiler!).<br />However, the animation was pretty darn good, uh, no, wait, would have made it better!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use KINDLE fire HD and this one seems to work  the best  of the  clocks I have tried for me.<br />  A nice feature would be the ability to change the digits colors<br />..unless I just haven't figured that out yet.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I wish all my friends and family would read and join in the fun! After all, manifesting with loved ones is exponentially more exciting!!
B008S80OU2|5.0|This set contains almost everything officially released by BOC. Only a few post-Columbia albums are excluded. And then there are tons of bonus tracks, some added to the album releases, some on the rarities disc, and HOURS of bonus live material supplied via download. If you're a BOC fan who only had a few of their albums, like me, this is an ideal way to acquire an almost-complete catalog for about $100.
B00BEYYEE4|5.0|Good storyline and great performances by Mark Walberg and Crowe who play adversaries in this action mystery drama about life in a big city.
B00AEFXEZE|4.0|I have seen this movie many times but only recently purchased it. I would not call it a great movie but it's compelling enough--mostly because Richard Gere is so goodlooking that it's easy to believe women purchasing his services. I have to admit I have watched it so many times just to look at him in a role where his looks ARE the most important trait of the main character. Still, his acting and that of the principals is solid. They are all believable.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This sequel to how a young Jim Kirk was recruited for the academy continues the story of his first term as Captain of the Enterprise with Spock and Jim learning to get along and trust each other. Well done. I pre ordered this DVD and recieved it within days of it's official release.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|...with Ian Rankin and John Rebus.  This is comfort reading start to finish despite the somber events and tragic lives. These are people we know and trust and we share their experiences as familiarity allows us to do.  A wonderful rainy day read.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show.  Watched the pilot back after having watched all three seasons thus far. Witty, well paced, and engaging story arcs. The characters are fun to watch.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Nothing but praise for this remarkable character and all she went through.  Great insight into the childs mind and how they coped.  Realistic, this could be a true story for sure.  So interesting that it was written from the childs view.
074401493X|5.0|Recommend it to anyone who is stuck, and plus it's a nice collector's item, and can't beat the price for what it provides, I gurrantee that you won't get lost with this gem.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love this author.  Her stories are very insightful and document the time period very well.  A great story that I did not want to end.
1781162646|4.0|I love some Stephen King. To me this was totally different than most of his books. Not horror, it's more of the mystery theme. Really enjoyed it though because the boy can write.<br />This was a sweet coming of age book. It had a lot of carnival theme to it but it didn't bring the amusement park to life as much as \\"Palisade Park\\" but it didn't really need too. The story more than made up for it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Confusing at first with alot of characters to keep straight, but once in i was all in!  Could not put it down!1  Very well written I will read more by this author.

B009B1UZ7C|4.0|I think I might even love this after listening a bit more.  He's got a fascinating voice/tone and I'd really like to hear more from him.  I know he's being written up as reminiscent of Dylan/Beatles yet he's quite truly his own person.

B00594XOZU|5.0|I noticed when you use your kindle fire with this app, it doesnt let you change your name. Thats all. You basically can do anything but change your name. The app itself is great and perfect to use as long as your friends have it. (OF course) I give it a 5++!
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Did not finish. Pretty boring. Great spectacle of a production. I did not connect with any characters at all. This story seems so trivial. When I read this in high school it seemed so exotic, relevant and adventurous, now just dumb. Great movie, boring story.
B00CFYAT6O|1.0|This 2013 release is a huge disappointment, especially after the incredible 2011, \\"Revelation\\", and the live album compared to this latest release,\\"Made up Mind\\". Where the hell did Susan's soul-full vocals disappear to? Almost all her vocals on this record are rushed to a speed of 78 rpm. While there is some great guitar pieces from Trucks, this is a nightmare production-wise! Not even the prolific producer, Mutt Lang, could have saved this mess.  The only decent track is the last one,\\"Calling Out to You\\", and it pales in comparision to \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" from the \\"Revelation\\" album. This latest Tedeski-Trucks effort  should have been titled,\\"Lost Their Way\\". Don't waste your money!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great movie, terrible playback from amazon roku as usual. Seriously using roku is terrible, I really would like to AirPlay amazon from iPad or laptop and see if that is better playback performance. I know that the controls would be better.

0385343248|5.0|Of course, it's written by a gaijin = a foreigner - so many might wander if this book lives up to the real japanese customs and history. It's with pleasure that I announce to you all that, yes, this book is simply amazing and it delivers a historic moment in japanese history - the battle of sekihagara and the ascencion of Tokugawa Ieyasu - with perks of Clavel's incredible and creative mind. Everything in this book is based on real facts. So what are you waiting? Go read it!! =)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for the next season....next decade. Love the characters and storyline, venue, costumes and accents. More people will be watching.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Loved it!!  I would definitely watch it again.  I loved the acting and the artistic work as well.  Two thumbs upIII
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Thin storyline. We know the outcome because it's based on a true story. The filming was fabulous, acting average.<br />Makeup and  special effects were very good.

B003QS9WIE|5.0|The movie deals with betrayal, revenge, love and obsession. It's a beautifully made film with great use of metaphor. How far would you go to be the best? How much would you sacrifice for revenge?
B00F35B8F8|3.0|JJ Abrams rebooted Trek universe is visually excellent. And the movie is a good, fun movie. However having some affinity to the original characters I have mixed feelings about the new franchise. As fun summer movies they are great. I don't know if they stand up quite as well to the richer story lines of the old Wrath of Kahn and Voyage Home. But they are at least equal to the Undiscovered Country and surpass probably all the other Trek films.<br /><br />The reason I can only give three stars is primarily comparisons on the characters. And, trying to avoid any spoilers, the reintroduction of such an iconic story line just didn't seem to be called for this early in the reboot life cycle. Regarding the characters, it seems that Abrams characters border on parody of the originals. Chris Pine seems to have some moments of gravity and some of his frat boyish persona may be a result of this being a younger, brasher Kirk, perhaps updating the Jame T of the original series, but pretty sophmoric when compared to the Kirk in movies 2,4,and to some extent 6. Zachary Quinto seems to be just be mimicking Spock, versus Nimoy who I think really defined and owned the role. Bones is great and spot on, but Scotty and Checkov are really on the parody side of things. The Zoe Saldia's Uhura is an interesting twist, and while I'm a fan of hers, the character just seems somewhat forced. Sulu is sort of set dressing. Last and maybe least, why does Abrams think a starships engine room needs to look like a factory? In the first movie I think he used a brewery for a set, and while he used a tech lab for part of this one, the industrial setting in other scenes just seems out of place.<br /><br />Now for this movie, again avoiding spoilers, while interesting to see this plot line rebooted. the movie looks great, it flows very well and it's a fun couple hours, with some decent acting and a few thoughtful scenes.  But all of the symbolism and depth of it's source material seem forced now. The characters are too young in their relationships for this to have the impact it did a couple decades ago. That said, it's a fun ride. I just think there could have been more to this story, without giving up the action portions. However a couple of the iconic lines that were sort of redistributed in this movie for me fell flat. If you know nothing of the old universe I don't think it will matter.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie, probably better if you don't know the source material. For long time Trek folks who have heard of the connections to the past here, I have to think this will come off as disappointing. I think JJ's fun reboots will be well suited for the Star Wars franchise which was always meant as space opera, and I thank him for reinvigorting my beloved Trek, but would be nice to see if the next caretaker could add some depth. It doesn't have to go full Battlestar Galactica dark and drama, but still...you think Ronald Moore might be interested?<br /><br />Oh and just because it probably needs to be said..Seriously there are other effects besides lens flare.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Wait for the next season to start.  This helped me get caught up!  I had a hard time getting into season 2 but after I did, I was excited.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The story didnt stay in my mind very long, but I enjoyed it while I read it. I would recommend it.
0061564893|1.0|Every serious researcher knows it was extraterrestrials who took the Chinese on a joyride around the World a couple of days before Zheng He's fleet took off. Prof. Dr. Gavin Menzies, in his infinite wisdom, of course knows this too, but he chooses not to mention it yet, because he wishes to publish this revelation in a later publication.  This will be his crowning achievement upon which the Church of Menzies, with it's original roots in the fifteenth century will be based.  Tom Cruise has already agreed to play Admiral He in the churches first cinematic dramatization of the extraterrestrial abduction.  Co-starring will be John Travolta.  Filming will commence in Salt Lake City as soon as the Menzian testament is completed.  There is a rumor that the Pope has agreed to donate the box he wears on his belt as a prop.  It's going to be Epic!

B005MHI0QM|5.0|I read this quite a few years ago and since we were going to Amsterdam decided to read it again before going to Anne Frank museum.  It is so moving and a good read just to remind our selves what it was like at that time in all of<br />Europe.
B0095P31L6|3.0|For a cartoon targeted for a younger audience there was some bad language. Story line a bit weak. The CGI was very good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have gave it five stars because it's dramatic ,interesting, and odd. If I have to pick a book to read I recommend The Hunger Games.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|What a fantastic show and BluRay quality is fantastic highly recommended to add to your collection. Very happy with this disc and want to see her live.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|At first I found this book irritatingly disjointed and almost abandoned it.  I am glad I kept reading because I finally was able to keep the characters straight and pick up the story line.  The author did very well developing her characters and seemed intimately acquainted with tragedy and loss.  I also thought her analysis of long term intimate relationships astute and told with loving humor.<br />Had it launched better,  I would have given it more stars because the story ultimately became very engaging.  This is a book  I would recommend to my lady friends.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie. Really enjoyed it. Kept me guessing the entire show  would recommend this to friends and family anytime. Great
B00571F26Y|5.0|I loved this book.  I had previously eaten gluten free from both of my sister's recommendations but this book totally sold me on being gluten free.  It goes into some science but the author does a good job of making those parts readable.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show. It's a great change to see a show without all the violence and bad language. Also neat to see how others before us lived
B007HUD6OS|5.0|As mentioned in other reviews the ending was really rushed.  You get the vote on the bypass and a few more paragraphs the book is over.  The other thing is there is no mention on putting the bypass on the other side of town or even moving it further out, it was strictly a yes or no thing.  I wish at least an explanation that it was the best spot that all other routes were considered.  Still an excellent book that anyone should read young or old.
B00B1TJO10|5.0|Extremely useful book. Love it!<br />Very nicely written. Flows like a charm. Understandable and clear. Worth all my time. My favorite book so far (in statistics -- that is a compliment, I have quite a number of stats books that I use as bricks to level off my table without one leg!!!)<br />I could not find a similar one by Andy Field for SAS statistics. That would have been interesting.<br />Additionally, i would have loved one specifically for mixed methods in cancer symptom research.

0744014956|5.0|The finish and the binding on the book is great.<br />Like most people I use the internet for quick tips and hints on where i can find collectibles, but this guide goes way beyond that. It shows you locations with in depth pictures for all missions, side quest, etc. For the price of $23.00 this is definetly the cheapest around. Just buy to book already!
B00846REIS|5.0|I haven't read a book this good since the 50 Shade's Series.  This story was very well written & was a hard to put down until finished type of book.<br /><br />Definitely a must read.
B000JQUZCI|3.0|This was in interesting, though severely overdrawn, read. The<br />language use was enjoyable but the main character, the creator of the monster, was a judgmental and annoying man who whined about his fate rather than taking steps to make things better. He is a super annoying character.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Great movie. Wonderfully made, not a cheesy musical. Great acting and singing had some surprises from the actors. Moving story.
1907016414|4.0|If erotica doesn't crumble your literary cookie these days, or if you think you might be offended reading first person accounts of less-than-consensual sex (i.e., rape) then you might not want to read this book. It's the kind of book a writer would use to send a simple message to the world: I'M WILLING TO TAKE CHANCES. And, for her act of bravery alone (in a literary world where 99% of all writers play the `tried and true' game), Chloe Thurlow deserves a round of applause. Then, we could probably argue whether or not her heroine is a little bit too passive, and a little bit too twisted for her own good, and the good of the novel. One's suspension of disbelief is hardly forced into submission by a young woman who discovers that great sex comes close to a Zen breakthrough while abused by (some of) her captors. I can hear the feminists building a gallows, checking twice if the noose is tight enough...Although since the Stockholm syndrome, we've learned that the relationship between a kidnaper and his victims is a little bit more complex than we thought, Girl Trade invites us to examine the possibility that somebody can experience an entire array of sexual awakenings while spending three months in a non-stop intercourse frenzy, some voluntary (to her own surprise) and some coerced (to her own abandon). By the way, did I mention that all the men in this book are Muslims...? Yeah, talking about playing with fire. The excuse that this entire scenario is nothing but a pretext for describing steaming sex scenes--like all erotica is--can take us only that far. The book is designed to shatter taboos and steps on toes, one too many.<br /><br />Nevertheless, before walking away from Girl Trade, I would suggest you read only one chapter: chapter three, \\"Escape.\\" That chapter (as well as 4 through 9!) could very well serve as a business card for a writer who sends a second message to the world: I CAN WRITE. Because Chloe Thurlow can definitely write; better than two battalions ofaspiring writers out there, and definitely better than a host of people whom the world calls bestselling authors, but have failed English Comp in College. To say that I found myself enamored with the prose of an extremely talented writer is an understatement. Anybody who has the slightest interest in the craft of writing, should be able to tell that Thurlow has been blessed with an excellent command of vocabulary, a gift for assembling simple yet compelling sentences, and an instinct for how much is too much and how little needs to be said just to engage the reader's imagination. Her paragraphs flow effortlessly, her ratio between exposition, inner monologue, and narrative is spot on, and her quirky comparisons pepper everything with just the right amount of dark humor (and in my book that's a plus). I belong to the school of thought that says that voice equals style, and style equals rhythm (did Virginia Wolff say that?). If that's true, then I'm sold to Thurlow's prose because I find the rhythm of her sentences intoxicating, the kind of music I like to listen to, the kind of writing that makes me re-read the paragraph I just finished. The voice is there--unmistakably unique. I might be old-fashioned, and actually paying attention to such things, when story should tramp style, right? Not necessarily, but that's not the object of this review. Let's just leave it at \\"different strokes for different folks,\\" a cliché totally appropriate when reviewing erotica, one has to agree. Back to chapter three: steamy sex scene on a beach between a small-breasted cutie from London and some sheik Samir who smuggles Arab emigrants across the Mediterranean. Not that original, is it? That's not the point. The point is that the entire episode is narrated in an almost lyrical fashion; the poetry that permeates the entire scene, the implied tenderness of the lovemaking, the candor with which the heroine bares her body (while the writer bares her soul...) are disarming. After reading ittwice back to back, I found myself wrestling with a simple question: \\"Did I just read erotica (i.e., explicit rendering of close-ups on genitalia), or this is a love scene that belongs in a different novel, maybe a heart-wrenching love story between two people belonging to two worlds at odd with each other?\\"<br /><br />So why is Chloe Thurlow writing erotica? I'm sure she has her reasons. And I don't want to give the wrong impression. I don't find erotica a throwaway genre, a literary bastard, an artistic forgery akin to pornography. On the contrary, I think that when it's well done, it's as much a legitimate genre as any other, and famous names dabbled in it.  In the hands of a gifted writer, and Thurlow definitely belongs to the club, we are left with no choice but to jump out of our Victorian suits, drop the Augustinian horse blinders, and simply look at ourselves in the mirror admitting that we are sexual animals, and that there is no shame in that. But at the same time, for the sake of tapping into a much larger pool of human resonance (and reaching a much wider audience), I think Thurlow should go mainstream. She can still keep her insights into human sexuality (of which she has plenty), and still entertain us with vivid scenes designed to haunt our (wet) dreams.But, in my humble opinion, her potential for crafting compelling prose could be better expressed in stories that will... reach deeper. At the end of the day, even when we're able to come to terms with the fact that we are pathetic sexual animals, we're still left with the hope that maybe--just maybe--we're a little bit more than that. And Chloe Thurlow might be brave enough, once again, to help us figure out exactly what that `little bit' is all about.
B000001FN3|5.0|Alan Parsons hit it big with \\"Tales Of Mystery And Imagination\\". A truly inspired masterpiece, with a most interesting subject matter, the literary works of Edgar Allen Poe.  Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson collaborated for one of rock's greatest concept albums of all time. Put this record, disc, or download on and have your mind blown!

I love the combination of math, reasoning, logic, association, memory and cause and effect puzzles that need to be solved to advance to the next level.

B000IZAHB4|4.0|I have seen this movie multiple times. Yet and still I wouldn't mind watching it over and over again. This is one of my favs even though I hate that ugly creepy thing that goes around killing everybody. Overall I don't think I would get tired of watching this movie.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Totally new to Remote Control world. This will get you hooked. Start off with high wing aircraft, then Helicopter, then speed boat. You can purchase other models as you improve your skill set. I had never touched an RC model before and flying one is not as easy as in You Tube videos. It's like you are all thumbs. But then the hand eye coordination clicks and you are on your way. Big advantage withe the simulator is that you do not destroy your pocket book with simulated crashes which allows you to purchase higher end equipment when you do buy.
0395389496|5.0|This book is a gift for my 6 yr old son he loves the movie and is going to ride the polar express this christmas in north carolina and on the train ride they read the book and had to get the book for him for this trip it is very nice and clean!

0307476073|5.0|Although I had frustrations with the authors lack of preparation prior to her hike of the PCT, I found a respect for her perseverance and courage.  It's nice to read about a woman accomplishing something so challenging.  The book reinforced women's ability live their dreams.
B00519YRH2|5.0|We were looking for a movie to watch with your 6 and 8 year old children and came across Big.  It has been years since we last saw it and had fond memories and so figured that the kids would like it.  We were right; they loved.  One word of caution, it does have some swears and adult scenes, but overall we found it to be appropriate for the age group.  It was a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy and so I strongly recommend.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Not what I thought it was going to be. Love me some Leo and I liked the idea concept of the story just not really the theatrics of it all.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|While I own 7 devices that will stream Netflix, I bought the Chromecast because I don't own any other streaming device that supports Amazon Instant and HBOGO.  I knew that both Amazon and HBOGO were not available at launch, but HBOGO is pending and I'm hoping Amazon will follow.<br /><br />My workaround in the meantime?  The Chromecast &#34;Cast from Chrome&#34; feature - if you can stream it in Chrome, you can transfer the video to the Chromecast.<br /><br />Sounds great in theory, but be forewarned: your streaming experience is fully dependent on the specs of the machine that is running the chrome browser.<br /><br />Case in point: My wife is watching GoT on HBOGO at the moment.  She really wanted to watch on our HDTV, so I showed he how to do so on her MacBook Pro and Chrome.  The problem? It's an older MacBook Pro, and while the streaming is flawless in Chrome itself, the moment she chose to &#34;cast&#34; it to Chromecast, the video became really choppy - unwatchable.<br /><br />To see if the real problem was the fact that both her laptop and the Chromecast were on the network via wi-fi, I turned off the wi-fi on her laptop and hard-wired it to my gigabit network - same result.<br /><br />Then, to see if it was HBOGO itself or her laptop, I went upstairs to my desktop (overclocked quad-core 4GHz with 12GB RAM and a GeForce 275) and &#34;cast&#34; HBOGO from there - absolutely flawless HD on Chromecast.  But it's upstairs... how do I use it as a remote control when I'm not even in the same room?<br /><br />The takeaway:  Chromecast works best when streaming directly from the cloud (via a &#34;native&#34; app), or if you have a *beefy* laptop/desktop nearby running Chrome.  If you want to stream your favorite videos often watched on your phone or tablet, or if you have older/cheap hardware at home, wait until there are more &#34;native&#34; apps...<br /><br />... Until then, this is just the 8th device for me to watch Netflix.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Three stars for ease of use and setup.  Really painless<br />- The Netflix content streams HD with no stuttering.<br />- *Beefy* machines can also stream HD with no stuttering via Chrome-to-Chromecast<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It really needs more apps.  Will add a star for HBOGO/MAXGO/etc. &#34;native&#34; apps.  Will add a star for Amazon Instant app.<br />- Chrome-to-Chromecast experience is not top-notch (see above)<br />- Audio streamed from Chrome to Chromecast is significantly lower in decibels than the &#34;native&#34; apps.  Again, it may be based on the audio card on the machine running Chrome.for ease of use and setup.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Loved Season 2.  Engaging, creative, pulls you into the story line.  In my opinion, a must see.<br />Don't miss season 1 to bring this all together.
