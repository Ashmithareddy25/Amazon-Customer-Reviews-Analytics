B000T4EDXC|4.0|I really did enjoy the movie. I had seen a more recent version but it just didn't live up to this one.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am very pleased with this app. Very User friendly. Does exactly what it promises. Reply glad that I found this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like puzzle games and this is no exception! My 6 year old lives to play it with me and does quite well.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I can't stop playing this CD! Best PSB release in years! They are back in top form! Do buy it!
B00FGKF888|5.0|The Wes Anderson Collection is one hell of an impressive book. Flipping through its first few pages I thought, \\"this book was meant for my coffee table.\\" And I don't mean that because of its hefty size, but rather the way the book is laid out and how it lends itself to multiple readings.<br /><br />Extended book review can be found on my blog here: [...]
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|bought this before a while back. they ended up removing the app from the store. I was excited to see it come back and yet I still cant play it on my kindle. I am high up in the game and it wont show my level. disappointed again
B0093QE37S|5.0|The movie that rescued Ms. Hepburn's career is fantastic.  One could gush, but it speaks for itself.  Go on.  Watch it.  You know you want to.
B00ESF2772|5.0|Always a great book. I purchased this for my granddaughter to start her on basic word recognition and phonics. Dr Seuss books are the perfect tool for early trading skills.
159514188X|5.0|This novel, \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" is about Hannah Baker, a young girl who has committed suicide. She recorded several tapes explaining the thirteen reasons why she had killed herself. This book is very moving and makes me and many people have different views on things. This novel goes to show what rumors can do to a person. I recommend this book to everyone of all ages. It helps people realize that just by the things that can be said and actions that will be done can drive someone to suicide. The book is hard to put down once you start it. It's very well written and at an easy reading level. I think everyone who has the chance to should check out this book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it and so does my kids. This game is fun for the whole family, pass it around! Thanks Gameloft
B003YT5TGE|4.0|I have watched Office Space several times. My girlfriend had never seen it, or I probably wouldn't have rented it. If you haven't seen it and need a laugh, it is well worth watching.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Excellent movie. It was a great history lesson of the musicians that recorded at Sound City. Not only is Dave Grohl a great musician, he is also a great music historian and director. I love the fact that he was able to get so many different artists to record in analog using the old Sound City equipment. The highlights were the recordings with Paul McCartney and Rick Springfield as well as Stevie Nicks. Any person that loves music should watch this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has wonderful graphics. Its good if you can spend money but if not still a great game!!! I've been playing it for a long time.
B008JFUR10|4.0|I am so glad I finally get to watch this movie, although there were a bit of trouble with it. There was a delay in the shipping which caused to be delivered a day later than it should have, plus there is a small dent on the side of the cover for the case leading into a small part of the back of the case. And there was also a few scratches on the dvd, which it should not be like that for a brand new copy; the two Blu Rays discs on the other hand were perfect! Overall I am happy I finally have it!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love it . I always like the part when you hit Ben in his belly and also the science lab.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It's fun and addictive, but really frustrating. Pony prices are so wildly inconsistent. The thing that bothers me most is having to connect to social media to get hearts (one of many in game currencies) to buy some ponies to finish some of the quests. I don't want to connect this game to Facebook, so I tried making a Gameloft account and this game doesn't recognize it. So annoying that I can't get these hearts. A few other annoyances but those have all been covered in other reviews here.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|don't miss all seasons starting from season 1 you will be hooked so if your not wanting to get hooked don't start
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|One of the best weapon apps out there. May not have as much selection as say GunClub 2 but the level of detail, options, and variety that is put into each firearm is spectacular. Wholly recommend this app.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I can`t believe this game is free! The visual effects are really cool. Recommended for anyone who loves hockey. VERY short download and doesn`t take up much storage space.
140006922X|4.0|Although a more intellectual friend criticized lack of scholarship, I found Aslan's explanation of the origin of Christianity to make a lot of sense.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|REALLY ENJOY PLAYING.  MY REFLEXES ARE IMPROVING.  ALSO HAND AND EYE COORDINATION IS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.  I MAY GET GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT MY GRANDKIDS!
1878424319|5.0|I ordered this book after having a friend tell me about it! It truly was eye opening. It also not too hard to read. Read it in a couple of hours. Only 138 pages and they are written at maybe a third grade level. The information inside the pages was deep and philosophical. I think if you have the will power to follow these four basic principles, your life could change. Like he says, it all has to come from within.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's like the other hunting game I got from these guys it's better though I can get a COD killcam
0345803485|5.0|What can I say about this. I  don't see why it is appealing to women and it doesn't contain anythig I have never heard before.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|You will have to spend about $5.00 to get ahead. It is worth the $5.00, you will have a great time with the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that they finally put this game on. So know I could play on my own tablet then borrowing my tias or my cousins.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was quickly pulled into this story and had to keep reading find out what would happen next. A thoroughly involving story.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This movie/document would convince most people that every country should have universal healthcare. Yet, I don't think we are told the entire story about how long people often have to wait for their &#34;free&#34; healthcare, which is not free. They pay high taxes and food prices and have lower wages in many of these countries.<br />Obamacare is a sad premonition of what universal health care would look like. Cost more for less services-universally.<br />I'm sure it was possibly meant to convince people that we should have that kind of healthcare everywhere, yet the hidden pitfalls remain hidden in this documentary.
B000067FP8|5.0|its gremlins! fun and awesome movie. the first one was good, but this one is awesome. funny, lots of new gremlin types. its good. my 5 year olds favorite movie at the moment. maybe spooky for some kids, but its fun for everyone. a great classic. if you haven't seen either of them, i recommend both. check em out!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|All seasons of STTNG were awesome. A few bad episodes here or there, but every season is worthwhile.<br />Season 4 is next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played candy crush on my phone and i loved it so much so i tried to get it for my kindle but i couldnt D= D=  but Now I CAN AND ITS SO MUCH FUN!!!!![...]
B000FBJAF0|3.0|Vivid and quite frightening characterisation of the antagonist, Zoran Zilic. Calvin Dexter as the sort of anti-hero come hero is almost too perfect to be true; a kind of working-man's-Jason Bourne-lawyer-come-batman-vigilante on a personal crusade to rid the world of the sociopathic genocidal maniacs of the world. The plot is intricately woven around the tragic and senseless murder of a young American foreign-aid volunteer in the Bosnian war by the monster-mercenary, Zilic, and the boys' well-to-do grandfather seeking vengeance through Dexter who spends his life making self deprecating, tortuous reparations for his own personal tragedies. What's preventing this rolicking thriller from getting 4-stars is the slightly flimsy, and all too fortuitous - at times even seemingly coincidental - development of the story towards the climax. Once we get to the apex it seems to take on a randomly chaotic 'fizzle' but ultimately predictable ending. At the end of the day it is a thrill-a-second adventure that delves into the disgraceful genocide in Bosnia and the insight into some of the likely factors, dynamics and protagonists around this true human horror. Here the master of faction delivers a very honest, chilling and probable view of how the awful and senseless 'ethnic-cleansing' chapter unfolded in Bosnia. From there however we move into the realms of Bond and Mission Impossible, which unfortunately detracts somewhat from the raw terror of the Bosnian conflict and the international politics surrounding it. It is however jolly exciting and if you can get past the, at times, superficial inadequacies of the plot, a real roller-coaster ride around the cold, harsh human failings in the Balkans, the intolerable claustrophibia of the steaming jungles and tunnels of Vietnam and the oppressively humid darkness of the deep third-world Caribbean coast of South America. In the great scheme of things it does raise questions around some of the possible circumstances that lead to 9/11. the theory is that if Calvin Dexter had not intervened with his private crusade, then the well-laid plans of other 'third-forces' may have prevented 9/11 from happening. This sub-plot runs throughout the novel and raises the interesting dilemma: is it better to entertain some, seemingly, lesser evil in order to achieve the greater good; or does evil need to be brought to account at all costs, even if it results in further tragedy. Poignant thread, I think could have been more of a central element of the entire plot. Still, exciting, edge-of the-seat stuff from the master storyteller.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's really candy crush.  It's so much prettier than the bootleg version I put on my kindle!!  So glad it's finally here.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game despicable me minions are the best<br />Helps pass the time on my breaks. Great graphics and ha game play. Wish gru coins were easier to get though
B000QDA7OU|5.0|I have found that this is a very good movie that show the life of nuns and what happens when on &#34;loses their way&#34;.  I believe this is must see prior to entering a convent for any woman.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I love Stephen King books.  This book did not disappoint and was so hard to put down!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I just started and I have no complaints.I enjoy hidden object games I never had it in this form before.
0571238343|5.0|This was a recommended text by my animation school, and I'm glad I got it. It has a lot of useful information and references. There are many different ways and styles to execute particular animation exercises and skills, but the book provides a lot of examples that readers can make an informed decision on their own. After over a year of its purchase I continue to read through it for reference.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|An excellent take on the super hero genre with Sanderson's flair for the twist! As usual he takes the universe and makes it his own.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app not only lets you use photos u already have but you can also download pictures from google and you can create ur own pictures.one of my favorite apps!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not as good as the Shining, of course, but this was a non putdownable book.  I loved it; of course I love all of S. King's book!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|'The Shining&#34; was the book that made me a life long reader of books. Doctor Sleep was an extension of this story. The main character is the boy, now a man, with the same power to shine with an additional character needing his help.<br /><br />The story is classic Stephen King, good versus evil where good prevails.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City of Bones is the first book in a five book series.  City of Bones is a supernatural book all the way.  There is a tinged of romance, but this is definitely a supernatural, kick-butt and take names kind of book.<br /><br />The leading main character is female. Clary does not know anything about supernaturals or their existence.  Clary, raised and lives in the human world ... until one day, her world is turned upside down, and she begins to see things that no human should be able to see.<br /><br />Hang on tight, because this book is 485 pages of a whirlwind roller coaster.  You will be following her through out her discovery and introduction into a world of vampires, warriors with special powers, demons, and, so much more! This adventure begins to unfold as Clary tries to solve a mystery, which began with the disappearance of her mother.<br /><br />There are some parts in here you might get a bit teary. There are definitely parts in this story that will have you gasping, startling moments, and time when you will laugh.<br /><br />I received the entire set of hardback books as a promo from my work (I had no clue they were coming. They were gifted with no strings attached). On Amazon.com, these books sell for $4.99, and considering the number of pages ... you are getting a great deal! They are well worth the buy.<br /><br />If I had not received the full set, I would have bought the rest right away! The stories are that good.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Since you find out by maybe the middle of the book who done it, there are no twists there. It is more about how people deal with the hand that they are dealt. It is also about how having certain information changes perception of people, events and relationships. I think it would be a good book for a book group.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception is a very entertaining movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was a bit confusing at first but it all comes together at the end. I would highly recommend Inception to anyone who is looking for an action packed thriller.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book! I cannot imagine anyone not loving this book. So well written! It is one of those books that both parents and children will enjoy. I recommend that as a parent of middle school children or above, after reading it, leave it on the coffee table and say nothing to your kids. Let them just find out for themselves.
0345533666|5.0|Page turner.  I would recommend to those that like legal thrillers and plot twists and book groups.  Well written and good storyline.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Malala good luck on your journey,ill be praying for you. Hope you are blessed with wisdom and can make peace in your country and one day return a free educated women
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|I've been a fan of Paul since The Ed Sullivan Show debut. I read all the wonderful reviews for this album and was really looking forward to hearing it. I've heard it now about ten times and I'm sorry to say that Paul can barely sing on most of the songs. His voice is mostly shot and his singing reminded me of a frog croaking on some of the songs. His singing skills has been deteriorating for about ten years and this is the album where his poor singing outweighs the fine writing and playing. Sorry, Paul. It's time to call it a career as a recording artist.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a really fun and addictive game, but it does take a lot of patience if you don't want to spend money. I do agree with a fellow reviewer that it's good for me to put it down and do something constructive with my time while I wait for my energy to recharge.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I played Ico on the playstation 2 and this is the same thing but made for playstation 3. If I remember correctly it's non violent and more on the artistic side.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|I saw Isabelle Huppert in person at a film festival in the early 90s, and she spoke about H.G. (Chris Walken was there, too.) She said it failed because it presented a view of America that wasn't popular with many Americans. So i gave the movie a chance, and although some parts seem a little prolonged, the total work is a masterpiece. At nearly four hours, the pacing is more relaxed than your average western adventure film, so there are places in the story you wouldn't expect to get the treatment they do. Cinematography in this restoration is breathtaking. Movies simply are not made this way any more.
B000GWE44U|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|We finally to see something about the old man agents life and how he really met will.  Great movie to watch with family.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great kids movie. Has a great story of a girls want to be herself and has plenty of laugs .  A great family movie
B003M8NG94|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Best of all the Marvel superhero films to date, with the possible exception of Spiderman 2 (with Tobey Maguire). Highly recommended.
B006OZKX02|5.0|This is something you just have to see.  It is not for everyone, but it is for everyone with any sense!
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|Even though it was marked as a kid's game it did not hold my 4year old Granddaughter's interest very long.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This is a movie I watched growing up! Superb plot  and a great historical fiction. I would recommend this movie for families to watch together.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|This is an all-time classic!  Fun and entertaining with exceptional acting.  Michael Keaton should deserves an emmy for his role as Beetleguese.  The dinner-dancing scene was hilarious.  Appropriate for early teens on-up (10+)--younger kids might be frightened by some of the special effects.  Highly recommend seeing this movie---again and again!
B009POHHRG|4.0|I didn't think I would find a comic narrative of much interest, but there is an added element to this fiction beyond words: the artist's eye. It's a different way to enjoy story-telling. This particular tale has exquisite artwork and visual characterisations that are visceral in their own right.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Awesome book. It elucidates the life of steve from his childhood to his death.<br /><br />Book is written with a simple vocabulary for a better understanding.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I am 1/3 of the way through Dr. Sleep and liking it more and more.  I was quite disturbed at the beginning when King went into GREAT, morbid detail about Dick Hallorans' past. I really don't think that was necessary and in fact, might turn new readers off. So, with that out of the way, I am excited about the rest. I read his books slowly, savoring them.<br />Keep 'em coming Mr. King!  He really is one of favorite authors.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At times it was hard to handle the whole submissive-dominant thing but it's a good story and you should continue the series it gets better.
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House, Kathleen Grissom's debut novel, offers an amazingly detailed yet nuanced description of life on a plantation in the Deep South. I was surprised by how quickly I became invested in the lives and well-being of all the characters portrayed across the pages of this beautifully written book. Historical fiction is not my usual reading genre of choice, but I am so glad that I took the advice of many readers. I now understand why this book is a book club favorite and NYT best seller. With the holidays approaching, this novel is the perfect present for anyone on your list who enjoys vivid storytelling that keeps you engaged until the very end.
B005MMYBXI|4.0|Follows pretty close to the original in attitudes and actions of the people.<br /><br />Has the same cartoonish action scenes that are funnier than they are shocking,but that was to be expected.<br /><br />Well worth renting or buying if you liked season 1.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In is a must read for all women in the workforce. I don't agree with everything that Sandberg professes: I wish she had spent more time discussing working single mother's in the workforce - according to a Pew report published in May 2013 there are over 8 million single working moms today. I also believe that there needs to be space to discuss that perhaps many women don't want to \\"lean in.\\" It's possible that women have different ideals when it comes to measures of success and personal satisfaction. However, here is why I give this book 5 stars: it has created a dialogue. Agree or disagree with the author, this book has put discussions of women in the workforce in the national spotlight. In conversations with other women about this book, reactions have been as varied as \\"this book changed my life\\" to \\"couldn't get past the lack of connection to most working women who don't have access to the support systems of the writer.\\" Read this book and join in the debate; the needs of all working women is a discussion that should continue.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I cannot live without it! I use it on a daily basis and what I love most about about it is the different versions to read from. I always use the King James Version, however, if I don't understand some scriptures, I can switch to the Common English version to get a better understanding of what I'm reading. Love it!
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Fantastic can not wait for the next season!!! I so want the truth to come out. The Grayson's are a nasty bunch!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Gave me insight to Afghanistan and its people. Definitely worth reading. Very sad to see that women are treated like second class citizens and property.
159514188X|4.0|The author writes this book from an interesting point of view. I ended up really enjoying the book. My daughter is now reading it because she heard about it in school. It really makes you think about the effects one's actions have on others.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|The product has real measurements in regards to all activities, including sleep cycles, which most of other products do not offer. I compared almost everything on the market and this is the best by far. The only catch is that you fully appreciate the product if you also get their scale and the BP monitor. Then everything works together to give you a comprehensive health tracking. Nice integration with workout tracking and calorie intake to keep you on weight goal. Recommend for those willing to purchase other devices.
0345803507|5.0|There isn't much to say about these books that hasn't already been said! But, I enjoyed them and I was very pleased at how the book was wrapped up in the end. I love books that have great closure and a look into the character's future. This book didn't disappoint!
B001BANK32|5.0|Amazing book by an amazing author. There is so much detail in the book. It was hard to put down. I could easily read this multiple times and not get bored of it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow! Do not start this unless you think it is OK to do nothing but read! I wish I had saved it for a plane flight.  The last few pages are a surprise and really gives someone a lot to think about! What if ....  ?
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It sounded so much like my husband's clock he started to get out of bed at midnight while I was choosing the sound I wanted to use.  Very easy to read and many different display and sound options.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I started watching Broadchurch on an airline flight, and couldn't stop.  Now I have hooked 3 more people on it.  British shows are so good at developing characters and drama -- I wish we could get more of these here!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|So great to bond over such a great blend of new (Angry Birds) with the old (Star Wars).  Encouraged me to give Angry Birds a second chance.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was a good book. The only bad part was that sometimes you don't know who is telling the story and u have to  go back and .<br />So everything else it was a great book
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|It was so great to enjoy this wonderful classic again and share it for the first time with them, especially their excitement and laughter.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|this game is do awesome and all my friends think to.  I love this game its just full of new things to discover. you will never.
1440503257|5.0|Our grandson enjoys this cookbook.  He is 9 years old.  hopefully it will help teach him to cook.  Thank you.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game. Had found friend who had on his iPad and wanted it on my kindle. I got so excited when I saw it finally be on this thing. AWESOME
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|very good and no problems with the physical album cover and record itself. i think it'll be a classic someday, which is why i chose vinyl. and nothing sounds better than a vinyl record.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It indeed is a calculator!!! It works like a calculator! It's FREE!!! It's a calculator and it is free! Hehe
B00F56AZK4|5.0|This is a great puzzle that can be used for all ages.  It can be worked in few large pieces or changed into smaller sized pieces.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|I'm sorry but I had to see it myself, there IS adware (Flurry Analytics) buried in this game. I refuse to accept any full version software that contains advertising. I see it as double dipping and I am 100 percent against it. Therefore, until they remove the advertising I will not review the game proper and am not giving IT any stars whatsoever. The one star that I HAD to give it (because zero stars is not an option) means: FIX IT!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Read The Shining when I was younger and enjoyed the sequel very much! I think I'll read them both again before the year is up!!!! 😄
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|This cd is badass: im really impressed with this band. On a very cool note, the house looks awesome when conpleted! It's great when a band and their team goes out of their way to give you more bang for your buck. These two albums are a modern classic for both the ideas and the music.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|very much like xbox controller, has a nice grip.<br /><br />Took a while to figure out how to sync the remote with the dongle w/o reading manual
B008YZXYY2|5.0|This new music from Stone Sour flat out rocks your ass off, but their is enough variety and texture that it keeps you coming back for more. Corey Taylor is an exceptional talent.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Love love love it! GREAT album! Walk Off The Earth is an extremely talented band who utilize many different items as their instruments. You may know them as the band who had 5 people playing 1 guitar, covering Goyte's 'Someone that I Used to Know'.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Mel Gibson is one of my all time favorite actors.  Perhaps because he is not one of the politically motivated socialist freaks who have no ethics or honor.  We Were Soldiers highlights the loyalty and honor that America under Obama has lost.  I'm totally ashamed of our current political leadership and the total lack of patriotism, honor, ethics and loyalty now in this once great nation.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|And I loved this book and the characters in it.  Most of us made it through and the world is still spinning.  I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I know a couple people who have been waiting for this to be on the kindle. finally the legit ones here. now amazon just has to improve on dragonvale and ill never put my kindle down.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was purely amazing! Not the ending I expected! I absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down :))
1577314808|5.0|In my 46 years of living, I've read and studied Thoreau, Christ, Gandhi, Chopra among others.  The Power of Now is unquestionably the most important writing I've ever encountered. It contains the answers for life.  Echkart Tolle bares the Truth open for inspection, and presents it so that anyone can understand.  If you want to be free of pain and suffering, if you want the answers to life, if you are finally ready to be at peace, read this book today.  I never thought I could recommend a book over Walden, but this one is it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed this - not what I was expecting, but really good. I'm glad there is a sequel though or I might kill this guy :)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is an engrossing story about teens coming of age while facing illness too.  You can't resist the interesting characters that are fleshed out in all their emotions.  While the story is pulling at your heart strings it is also hitting your funny bone.<br /><br />I found myself not wanting to put this book down.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I still continue to enjoy the stories of A Song of Ice and Fire.  Looking forward to the next book!
B008383GE8|4.0|Perhaps a scientific bent would help, which I don't have. So a great deal went over my head, but overall I learnt a lot, so it was worth the effort.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was my first Liane Moriarty novel. The way the characters lives, though very separate, intersect so seemingly insignificantly, yet with such grave impact. Loved it.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Spartacus!!!!!! What can I say .... I Loved it!! I have the complete Spartacus trilogy! ! And this last season was the icing on my collection!! I watch Spartacus every weekend!! Excellent quality !!
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|this cd just isn't any good. the music and lyrics are very sophmoric. hopefully she can fall back on her so-called acting career.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i loved this book. it was set up in such a way it could be relatable to someone in that situation. it made me laugh and it made me cry.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|Works good.  Lots of details.  Good info on all but last page.  I hate a whole page of ads.  If I wanted to down load other apps I would
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was such a warm embrace to the closing of a great thriller.  Danny / Dan is a good man.  We all have demons but he has been a life long demon slayer.  He passes on his gift.  I can not imagine another book in this series because the Mr. King closed everything up so nicely for the constant reader.<br /><br />Thanks Stephen King for letting us re-visit.  Great Party!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A must read. Keeps you thinking. Just as good as Gone Girl.<br /><br />Excellent author.<br /><br />Can't wait to read Dark places.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|As usual this sequel seems to be running on fumes, story plot stretch to the max, needs major remapping to be more interesting.
B007N85POS|4.0|My son loves playing angry birds and once he figured out it was Rio (reference to the movie) he loved it even more. Sadly, being 2.5 years old, he already have quite a few stars.<br /><br />Other than that, its like any other angry bird game, but with a colorful fruity environment.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Taught me a lot of lessons that i will incorporate into my life such as, live the life that fits you and not the life society wants you to live.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is like any other angry bird game, but the additional cartoon shows on it (with internet connectivity) was great. My son will sit there for hours on end (if I let him) watching those cartoon shorts.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|So this isn't early John Mayer or even Continuum but man is this good music.  I loved those days but I also love the maturing sound and blues sound of this album.  Top flight effort on all tracks.<br /><br />A must buy if you liked Born and Raised.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I finally found the best game that I have ever played!!!<br />It lets you choose if you want to be human,elf,oark, and undead.

B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I've always been a Marvel fan, though not particularly an Iron Man fan. However, these movies paint a much more dynamic and human hero.
B002EXI5L2|5.0|Always a winning duo!  I have never been disappointed with a Doris & Rock movie. I only wish Doris would do a new movie. I miss seeing her in film.
B0058VW36U|5.0|As easy as this game looks, it gets more challenging as the levels increase. This is a great game to stimulate problem solving.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I'm a big Stephen King guy but this one did not do it for me. I expected a sequel to the Shining to be darker and creepier. This story was  foolish
B00632HWOG|1.0|The latest and newest version of Yahoo Mail really sucks. It is very hard to find information, the UI is not clear. Whatever Marissa Mayers is doing the yahoo mail is really degraded. Yahoo used to be fast and have a much clear UI, not it is very slow with the rotating symbol trying way too long time to load the mail (pretty sure it is my not my internet as I have a 30 Mbps connection and working perfectly fine). I hope yahoo realises the mistake and revert to their previous version if not they will loose a large number of users.
B00004YZFR|5.0|A must see for any music fan. A must own for any Stones fan. Great footage, great historical intensity, Can be watched over and over again.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|One of the most chilling and powerful statements in this book uses no words at all.  It's the underlying acceptance of each of the main characters that &#34;this is normal life.&#34;  It's normal to live with a speaker in your home so Dear Leader can spout his propaganda 24/7.  It's normal to know that you will never rise above your caste because your family has some minor political &#34;impurity&#34; in its history. It's normal that families are punished for 3 generations for the most unbelievably petty &#34;offenses&#34; toward the govt.  If you're lucky enough to have a TV, it's normal to have it tuned automatically and exclusively to the state-run stations.  It's normal to have a picture of Dear Leader on a wall that must be clear of any other pictures, and a special dusting cloth used to clean it each day.<br /><br />What spoke to me the most powerfully though was what drove each of the people in this book to seek freedom.  The human spirit is an amazing force....what causes so many to just go along to get along, and others to risk their lives for freedom?  This is a book worth reading, not only for the knowledge I gained about the darkness behind the DMZ, but for a fresh perspective on my own freedom.  I have such huge respect for the courage and stamina of North Koreans who know they want to be free.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was absolutely extraordinary! The two main characters, especially Amy, would have driven Freud completely mad! The story flows very well and I hated to put it down. When it ended I felt a real emptininess; I wish there was more. However, somehow I knew how things would go.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly and to read it before seeing the movie that's being made. It will never be as good as the book. And, I now plan on reading Gillian Flynn's other books!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another great Stephen King novel. It kept me spellbound from beginning to end.Where did he imagine his story plot....love his weird mind..
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|It was an incredible story of the miraculous power of love... Especially a mother's love... After the movie was over I cried for an additional 30 minutes .. I could not easily shake the impact of the love in the family - they grew closer because of their struggle..
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|Many parents want their children to be bilingual, but even if you are bilingual (or speak a different language from that of the country you live in), it's no easy feat. As Bourgogne tells us, \\"Sponges only absorb when dipped in water, not thin air or good will.\\" Becoming a bilingual family requires extensive planning, commitment, and a variety of resources. This book will help you find the resources and make a plan, but the commitment is up to you. Bourgogne presents plenty of research identifying the benefits of bilingualism and multilingualism, and by the end of the book you'll also have a better assessment of how much work will be involved, and how to select an appropriate level of commitment based on your desired outcome (fluency in two languages, biliteracy, and so on).<br /><br />Bourgogne advocates two primary methods in this book: \\"one-parent-one-language,\\" and \\"minority language at home.\\" There are other possible approaches and these methods are also tailored to various situations, but these are the two that receive the most focus. OPOL involves each parent speaking a language in which he or she is fluent with the child, so that each language is supported at home; mL@H involves one language inside the home and another outside the home, primarily supported by the community. While Bourgogne's techniques can be adapted for families that speak or intend to speak three or more languages, most of the information is tailored to bilingualism. She outlines how to make both languages an important part of everyday life, continually underlining the importance of need: if a child does not need a language to communicate, she or he will be less likely to speak it. (This is true of adult language learners as well, and there are plenty of ideas that adult language learners can implement.) She also addresses include expat living, international adoption, single parenting, and trilingualism.<br /><br />The book is also filled with ways to find and take advantage of family and community support, not just locally but globally. Some of the advice contained in these pages is relevant to any parent, but if you intend to have a bilingual family, it is required reading. And start early! If you begin planning and decision-making before your child arrives, you will have more options and have plenty of time to find an approach that works for your family. Finally, Bourgogne ends the book on the note that language goals and plans can and should be reassessed periodically, as your family and its needs evolve. This is a book you'll refer to over and over again, and the resources suggested are an excellent jumping-off point for your journey.community support, not just locally but globally.

B00015YVD6|5.0|Still goofy, still whacky and still the perfect mermaid movie despite the high level of cheese. Thanks for the amazing price, too!! Loved seeing baby faced Tom Hanks also.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Awesome movie! Lots of twists and turns, great ending! Awesome movie! Lots of twists and turns, great ending! Don't miss it!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|For most of this movie, I was mesmerized. The performances are terrific, which is not a surprise considering the cast and special props to the young girls who are very good as well. The moments that we are set up are genuinely scary without being too overt. It takes skill to scare. The director did a magnificent job with this film. It still gets to me just thinking of it. And it is old-fashioned in that regard. It rarely gives us the shaky cam look I cannot stand. There is little CGI. Not much blood or gore. I have seen it four times. And it is something special.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Then we get to the exorcism. That is the only part where I felt the film lost its way. It's not bad at all but doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the film. I guess it is eventual that they had to up the ante on the film level but I was still a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Not enough to stop me from loving this very scary film. It is a film that is fun and scary to watch simultaneously.<br /><br />And I enjoyed the extra features, particularly the interview with the family who experienced this (although how much of it is not said). The mother talks about even today she is scared and won't go back to the house. Although I heard from someone who recently said she 'must' go back. And then she won't even watch this film. It suddenly dawned on me that whatever she experienced, it was certainly real to her and to her family.<br /><br />No matter how much, or how little, of this film is based on actual events, I don't really care that much. Because it is a film. Not a documentary. They are trying to create entertainment. With that in mind, this is one of the very best horror movies ever made. Even with the ending exorcism I feel the rest of the film more than compensates.<br /><br />If your idea of horror is the bloodier, the gorier, the slashier the better? You will be disappointed in The Conjuring.<br /><br />If you like your horror subtle with the silent creaking of a door openingsending chills up your spine? This movie is for you.<br /><br />For this time of year especially, I give it my highest recommendation.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Although I am an adult, I find that this movie is beautiful: funny, tender, and Agnes is sooooo cute!!!!! The minions.... well, the minions are something else. I fell in love with them! I am buying Despicable me 2 as well.

B00701L5XS|5.0|I don't usually rate apps, but this one is exceptional. This is the best knot app I have come across. A very interactive app.  This app ties the knot right on front of your eyes. You can slow it down, back it up, run it forwards and backwards. You can rotate the knot to view it from any angle. There are great descriptions of the history and use for each knot. The only minor criticism ot that on a few knots the method shown is not realistic to how one would actually tie it in the field, but the finished form is always correct.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|Probably would be better for those who are more understanding of systems programming and design, however as indicated in recent media, that big sniffer in our sky is an actuality and both scary and somehow a bit comforting to know &#34;big brother&#34; has the backs covered for those who have nothing to hide. While I am devoted to our first amendment rights and descended from those early citizens who fought for these rights I believe our Country must be protected from those who wish to destroy those rights. Thus said, I did learn enough about the lovely old city of Seville I have added it to my travel bucket list!
B00BP0O7QW|5.0|The product was as described. I received the original copy that it is what I wanted.

B00A6CCF0K|3.0|'Doctor Sleep' is a typical modern Stephen King novel in that it is readable, entertaining, shocking in a few parts and suspenseful.  As a continuation of the story of the main character of 'The Shining', (a book that I have read many times) it is less successful.  I never had the feeling that this person was the same person from the original book (albeit as an adult), and the story relies on too many plot contrivances to advance the story.  Where, for an example, were this book's supernatural characters during the original novel?  Nevertheless, it was very interesting to read an attempt by Mr. King to advance one of his earlier stories, and I hope he tries it again.
0375812024|5.0|Daughter loved the book. Great distractions on every page.  Must have for travelling with toddler on airplane - along with lots of snacks!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great story! Nobody can tell a story like Stephen King in my opinion. An awesome sequil to The Shining.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|Liam brings the action genre to real a level with his acting skills. That's why Taken is successful. Stathem and Wahlberg are fine, but Liam brings a big bag of realism to the role. He doesn't rip his shirt off before a fight or spout cheesy lines every two seconds. Up to this point action films were all the same, or maybe the acting was just okay. The story here is good & simple and Liam elevates it. I look forward to Taken 3 that they announced will happen. Great decision for Liam to cross into the action world as a leading star.
B001BANK32|5.0|Redrum. It must be one of those words that can send an instant chill along your spine, especially said aloud by a five year old child, first wonderingly, then grimly, and, at last, with an adult understanding. If you think you know darkness, think again. The scariest monsters are not the ones that look ugly and brandish their claws, attempting to make us into a tasty breakfast. The scariest monsters are the ones that live inside us. That part that is capable of hurting people, hurting those we love. This is the real hair-raising stuff, this is the stuff of nightmares. This is what THE SHINING is about, about facing a deeply rooted horror of ourselves, of what we are capable, in the creepiest corners of our soul. Where does it come from? What does it feed on? How does one understand it? How does one get rid of it? Is it possible to get rid of it? Perhaps is has to be there, always, to counterbalance our other side, our loving side, the one that we are proud of and like to parade to family and friends, like to look upon in the mirror? Can one answer these questions? Stephen King tried, and I admire him for it. THE SHINING only looks like a horror story on the surface, but it's a story about pain we all go through, a story about search and doubt, and, ultimately, a story about yearning for love.<br /><br />Jack Torrance is out of work again. He's got issues, he's got issues big time, drinking issues, but he is over them. He thinks he's over them. He really wants to believe that. And he gets a job, thank God, he gets a job, as a hotel caretaker. The hotel happens to be a spectacular establishment by the name of Outlook tucked away in Colorado mountains and virtually unreachable during winter months. You can perhaps imagine the rest. That's right. A man, his wife, and their 5 year old son, Danny, get snowed in, in a gigantic empty building that echoes of the past, only those are not simple echoes. Danny possesses a special talent, \\"the shine\\", as the hotel's cook Hallorann calls it, when they meet upon Danny's arrival and Hallorann's departure. Danny sees things, Danny hears things, and those are terrible things. They are frightening and real, but Danny doesn't want to ruin the peace between his Mommy and Daddy, who, at last, are on the path of reuniting, of finding love for each other again. Only Danny should tell them, because the hotel is stirring, slowly, and everything seems to be leading to a disaster, leaving the cut off from the world family in mortal danger.<br /><br />What else can I say? It's brilliant. Simply brilliant. I will probably reread this book many times, to pick up on a new nuance or story layer each time I dip my head into the horror of THE SHINING.nn calls it, when they meet upon Danny's arrival and Hallorann's departure.

B0037TPMOA|5.0|I am very glad that I chose this one to get introduced to the awesome Stephen King literature. This is one mind blowing thrilling horror drama exploring the father and son relationship in a strange way. The Stanley Kubrick movie is absolutely disgusting and doesn't deserve to be known as movie version of the book. Read it today to have an experience of a lifetime.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I think that this book definitely deserved a five-star review because it was a really good and it was very interesting and it just makes me want to keep reading and reading. I also like this book a whole bunch and I just want to keep reading the whole series and hope that there will be more and more books coming out so that I can enjoy and read all the books. I would love for other Diary of a Wimpy  kid book fans to read the whole series and recommend them to share there review.

B0006HBZXS|5.0|This was a replacement copy of my VHS movie and I have to say with the higher pixels it is outstanding. I love anything Anthony Hopkins is in. His consumate acting ability is amazing. The story is very exciting, as you don't know which way it is going to go next. I highly recommend this to add to your libary for those rainy (snowy) days...
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|new kind of game. i love it because i love playing uno with friends  but when i am alone it is hard for me to play so i donlwnloaded it.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Packaged and delivered on time. Stunning performances by the actors in a story of a troubled man.  The set and background was picture perfect. I don't want to know how much CGI was used as it takes the viewer right to the time when life was gay and resplendant. Definately a good one for the libaray.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good game to pass the time. Pictures are nice and are themed nicely. Have to rate or connect to Facebook for bonus level.

B00CF34B2I|4.0|Love the art, the game, bought full version. About one in 4 matches. . It crashes. No error just game is gone, it happens at the end at the game summary, so I have to play the match again sometimes several times to get progress. And sometimes cards like terramorphic expanse don't add the land that I pick. Otherwise totally awesome game.

B001FB4VXU|4.0|I would recommend this to everyone. It gets funnier with each season. At first I thought this show would be stupid but it's not, it's really funny and the characters are perfect together.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Perhaps in its time &#34;LA Law&#34; held my attention just as much as The Good Wife but it was mostly a masculine role with a few women tossed in.  Maybe even The Practice pulls even with this until it's last two seasons.  But for now, The Good Wife is a refreshing look into the back room of not just a law office but the personality of a good person among many not so good.  I love it and when I have finished the series...it will be Suits - but it does not compare in any way since it premise is so very beyond convincing.
B001KZG99A|5.0|We love superheroes in our house! We could not be happier with this show. Robert Downey Jr. Is worth the watch!
1589944607|5.0|I love the game, and I've never watched the series before. My husband loves the series so he was the one who wanted the game. However, it is not necessary to know the story of Battlestar Galactica.. But I guess that if you do it's even more fun! Love the board and the pieces. Very well made.
B000J159N8|5.0|It's a high quality movie that I really enjoyed very much. It depicts the reality of war and its consequences. Awesome movie.
B008N9AASC|3.0|Too bad: it is not an international version. I had to change the zone of my DVD player on my PC and now I cannot view it again.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game needs better firing needs to fire in the direction you are going instead of using the multi direction button
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this series. It is very well written, and I love the sudden plot twists. I love all of the characters along with their traits. Before I read this series, I was reading another book series. My mom told me about this one, and I thought that it would not be any good. After I read the first chapter I was hooked, and I finished the first book in one day. I finished the whole series in five days. I recommend this book to everyone.<br />  Some people say that this is a horrid book series, because of the hunger games. I agree that that is terrible, but it is a book. For entertainment. No one wants to read a book about living a quiet, boring life in, say, Tuscon, Arizona. People want to read stuff that is interesting, and that you normally wouldn't think about in everyday life. Some people also are paranoid that the hunger games will really take place in the future. I say: don't hold your breath. I am 99% positive that that will never take place.<br />  If you want an amazing, page-turning series to read, read the hunger games series!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Okay so I was pretty into Korn when they were huge.  I was in high school when I went to see them tour for \\"Follow the Leader\\".  I followed them from the beginning, and enjoyed them up until 2003's \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\". I've dipped in a little bit here and there since then, but nothing really impressed me.  First Brian \\"Head\\" Welch left the band, and then David Silveria... and I kinda don't like when the original band splits, so I kinda lost interest...<br /><br />Recently I've been listening to a lot of \\"classic\\" Korn, I didn't even realize that Korn had a new album coming out the very next day, after I randomly found myself web browsing Korn online.  I read about the return of Brian Welch, and I gave the new album a chance the next day, now that I had skipped the previous 5 albums...<br /><br />The end verdict is a good one.  Although I'd imagine I'd enjoy this album better if David had returned, just for my own stuborness of new members.<br /><br />... To be honest, I've been all over the place this year with new albums.  And likewise it's been a great year.  The new Yeah Yeah Yeah's album was amazing.  The new Filter album was amazing.  The new Nine Inch Nails album was amazing.  And now Korn has returned from the grave for me.  The first album I've really enjoyed since 2002's \\"Untouchables.\\"<br /><br />I hate to say it, but this new Korn album has left a more positive effect on me than the new Nine Inch Nails, and from the beginning, I've always been a bigger NIN fan than Korn.<br /><br />Every time I listen to this album, I love it more and more.  Favorite songs so far being \\"What we Do\\", \\"Spike in my Veins\\", \\"Never Never\\", and \\"Lullaby for a Sadist.\\"<br /><br />Maybe not my favorite Korn album, due to nostalgia reasons, but this is pretty close.<br /><br />Awesome.... Highly recommended.<br /><br />Sidenote:  It really does bug me when bands change members sometimes.  Not all the time, but sometimes.  Nine Inch Nails I don't worry about, cause that hasalways basically just been \\"Trent Reznor\\" with constant new members filling his vision.  But bands like Alice in Chains...  The newer singer is pretty good!  But I feel the band would have been more successful if they simply retired the \\"Alice in Chains\\" name, and started from scratch with this new vocalist since \\"Layne's\\" death.<br /><br />Another one... Guns N Roses...  Axl Rose is amazing, he's always been a legend, but the dude is old now...  He's very talented, but he should have let go of the \\"Guns N Roses\\" name instead of acting as immature as a teenager.  Wake up!  Let go of stuff!  Start over!  I think if Axl had devised a whole new band, the so called \\"new\\" Guns N Roses would be significantly more successful.  He should have gone ahead and reunited with ex band mates for the Rock and Roll hall of fame too...  when ARE you going to grow up...  I have a lot of opinions on the matter of Guns N Roses.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Ian Banks is currently my favorite science fiction author. I like all the Culture books, but this has to be the best. If you would like to know what good science fiction is, you should read Banks. He is just as good as Arthur C Clark and Isaac Asimov.
B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|Despite all the criticism this movie received, having the name Oz and remembering what a great movie the original with Judy Garland was, I went ahead and purchased this film. Franco, Braff, Kunis, and Weisz were all actors whose performances I anticipated to be great. Their work in the series Spider-Man, Scrubs, Family Guy, and The Mummy convinced me this film would be one worth watching. Much to my disappointment, the opposite was true.<br /><br />From the very beginning, Franco seemed like he was on some sort of low budget independent film and on the way to beginning his abysmal and short acting career. I could not understand it. The same went with Kunis. Every time they spoke, I was always puzzled with what exactly was going on. Kunis did horribly. What was supposed to be her sinister, wicked voice was amateur at best. The CGI and special effects were not even great. If you were perhaps still a child, then maybe there was hope that you would be able to enjoy this movie.  There were noticeable flaws in the animation. I wondered throughout the movie if there really was no one else who auditioned for the parts. Did none of the budget go towards properly casting this film? The writing wasn't that great, either. Much of it was predictable despite not following the storyline of the original. Disney should not have his name attached to this.<br /><br />This movie is one of the worst movies I have watched, and I've watched Glitter. I think that movie was much better than this.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I returned to all my 80s favorites in a true adventure, video, quest story.  The references to 80s culture were great and the online future, realistic.  Makes me think its time to start reading books on paper again!  Highly recommend this.
B00ENYCQX8|5.0|Great app!  It let me read epub´s but the best part is that i can switch the background to black.....  great feature to save some battery.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|My 9yo and I are Minecraft fans. We play on the XBOX all the time and he's been eying his Minecraft LEGO set (the original one) for quite some time, but it costs almost 100 bucks in Singapore. I was surprised it only costs 35 bucks on Amazon, even bigger surprise that the Nether set is out already (I was expecting it to come out on Xmas).<br /><br />The set is creatively designed, which is a great thing. The Zombie Pigman micro figure and the Ghast are cute as well hehe.<br /><br />To be honest, unless you're a Minecraft fan, this really is just a specially painted set of basic blocks, but that's the whole point, right? Minecraft is a block-based game, and to tie it up with LEGO is just a no-brainer.<br /><br />Good purchase for any Minecraft collector. Thinking of getting the other two right now :P
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very simple and yet so entertaining....!  I really like it... i have downloaded it to my iphone, my ipad and now my kindle.<br />I would recommend it to anyone... and its free.
0525952926|1.0|If you are a Socialist or have Socialist leanings you will love this book!  Follett takes every opportunity to portray Conservatives (both American and British) as heartless, racist, homophobic, rich snobs.  When one gay character came out to his brother about the only response was &#34;At least you're not a Republican&#34;.<br />I read &#34;The Pillars of the Earth&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34; and found them both to be totally engrossing books that I could not put down.  This book was written by someone else.  The dialogue between characters was never realistic and sounded like two 12 year olds in conversation.<br />Historical novels should not be used as an opportunity for a political lecture.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|The steel may not be the best and the tip a bit misaligned but you get the feeling you can take on a Rhino with this knife. It is massive and with some work you can get a reasonably sharp edge on it. When they say the blade is 1/4 inch thick that's exactly what it is!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was so moved by the things that occurred in Vivian' s journey through life  I Did not know about the trains before finding this book.  I intend to research this further.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for Amazon to have candy crush. Works great on my kindle fire hd. Very addicting I can't stop playing this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Easy enough to keep your attention, difficult enough for a challenge. Memory game that is fun and creative for all ages.

B00633W614|5.0|Loved Loved Loved this book!  My only wish is that trilogies on Kindle would all come together without the hassle of searching for the next  book at 3:00 am.  That being said, I adore Jeffrey Arches writing and I always feel such a connection to the characters.  By the end of the first Clifton Chronicles you'll be hooked.  Read them all and now awaiting till Oct 22nd to get the next one.  A little frustratiing to say the least!
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|I was thinking that the DVD would bring the complete live concert movie...but this is wrong....it brings only photos of the concert with live musics...I became disappointed with that...Anyway, it is always good to hear The Band...
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This album is much like Paul's solo career: with unforgettable melodies (&#34;New,&#34; &#34;Queenie Eye&#34;, &#34;Early Days&#34;, &#34;Scared&#34;) and at least one clunker (&#34;Hosanna&#34;). His voice is showing the strain of 55 years of performing, but his songwriting hasn't suffered. Working with four young producers seems to have revitalized him. At age 71, the man is still a musical genius and this album is worth the price if for nothing else than no one knows how many more he will do.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Doctor Sleep the sequel to the most beloved book The Shining shows Kings ability to weave together a story. Whether or not you enjoy that story is up to you. A GREAT story and terrifying on its own merits for sure(and def will keep you AWAY from motor homes of any sorts), but if you go into this looking to be as terrified as The Shining was you will be dissapointed. The book has lots of promise but scare wise doesnt really follow through to completion IMO. Still an excellent read and i would recommend it bc as most of Kings works its great-not his best but still great. And if you are a fan of The Shining you must be curious whatever happend to Danny, Doc, and Wendy.. this book wraps those characters up like a bow.
B00C7607BC|5.0|its the Little Mermaid... cant go wrong with a Disney Princess movie. my kids even will watch this movie with me (:
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|We were excited when we first download only to have the game crash repeatedly. Left it alone for about a week and now so far so good.. my 7 yo loves it!
B008N1V11U|5.0|EPIC! seamless play, amazing graphics.I spend atleast 2 hrs a night playing this game! Works great om my kindle fire hd!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints. Like all of his novels, he had me in his clutches from beginning til end. Bravo Stephen!
B00DJXSKWU|3.0|All in all a fun little RTS. Nice little time killer with a decent soundtrak. Works great on my kindle fire hd.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's always good to come back to a story started long ago and meet familiar faces again at different parts of their lives. It's clear that much of King's experiences go into this book, just like we find pieces of him tucked away in others.<br /><br />It's always difficult to put down one of his books when you get started and Doctor Sleep doesn't disappoint in that regard.<br /><br />I even shed a tear or two toward the end. Thanks Big Steve. It was a hell of a ride.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This is a great and entertaining game. You can play it for hours and hours. Love the speed and movements.
B007W4OZ76|1.0|I could not get this to work on my Kindle Fire HD.  Apparently not made for that.  Don't bother to install
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally they made this game available for kindle fire I am so happy to see that is on hear have been wanting to play for so long!!!!!!!!!
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|This application does not work on Kindle Fire HD.  Don't waste your time trying to install it.  Not worth it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I throughly enjoy the reboot of Star Trek.  I have been a Trek fan dating back to the original.  I really like how they are showing the Spock character's progression.  While I don't believe that he and Uhura every had a &#34;thing&#34;, still it shows his emotional side well.  The DVD is well done and a great addition to my Trek library.
031623480X|5.0|Was truly surprised at the valuable information. I truly did not expect to get what I received from this book. Very surprised.<br />Thanks

B00E6F15HM|5.0|I really cannot add anything to the accolades this genius has earned over the decades.  I feel extremely fortunate to have witnessed the dissemination of brilliance from this gentle soul.... since Genesis.  As I watch Peter age, (just saw him live last week), I am filled with angst as I realize there is no one to carry the torch.  This applies to all the rock icons who are in their late 60's...I'm an optimist, but musically, the future is bleak.  So, I beseech all you Gabriel fans, to get your children involved when watching his masterpieces (Secret, Growing, and this).  My 5 year old daughter often asks to watch \\"Peter\\"...and then she asks why \\"my eyes get wet\\".  When she hums Mercy Street, I want to tell her the story of Anne Sexton....but that will be another story we can share when she gets older....<br /><br />\\"Who's Biko daddy?\\"<br /><br />WE need to carry the torch.<br />WE need to carry the torch.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I really didn't think I was going to like this at all, but after viewing I was actually taken aback at how much I enjoyed it.  I watched it back to back...
1476727651|4.0|The story of Danny Torrence continues, but I wanted more time with him, Wendy and Dick. Like may of said it's easily a stand alone novel, you need to know little of Danny's time at the Overlook. And, that's where it disappoints. The big skip to Dan Torrence as an adult, following the path of his tormented father lacks a bit. That said, it's still a good read.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My kids love this app. They each used their saved allowance to buy their apps (we're teaching them about money). It's really helping my youngest learn his letters. He'll tell me what item he wants, I spell it and he finds the letters.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I like the Nintendo version of Monopoly. Aside from tokens I am not completely familiar with (would've expected Starfox somewhere in the game), this game is pretty fun. Not much different from the classic version, but the kids definitely enjoy this one more than they would the original.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|It's as good as it gets... Not dated, still works and is just a pitch perfect film start to finish.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|OMG I LOVE IT!! BEST SHOW EVERRR! Except I wish I could stream it live and not wait till midnight or the next day to watch!
B0009MAP90|5.0|I hate writing this review because it implies I didn't already own it, and what baby boomer idiot doesn't own it already?  Well, maybe I have it on vinyl and I just wanted a clean MP3 version...or not.  In any event, for the very few that do not have this album, treat yourself to the artist when he was only 20 years old & showing his greatness.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's easy way better than the others and I like the way the deer fall when you hit them<br />and the way it's Easter to buy stuff so you don't have to pay real life money
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Who wouldn't like to see Brad Pitt as a Zombie hunter?  Fun, full of action with some gore throw in. And I have to say Brad is as hot as ever! All in all, a very enjoyable movie. Just be aware of possible zombies!
1849163863|5.0|One of the best mysteries I have read and it has 2 other sub stories which were very good...book club loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the App. Its so realistic. It can be a little slow sometimes though. One of my favorite games though.
B0086449YA|5.0|Being a guitarist myself for decades, I don't recall anyone else that has as much talent as Mark Knopfler, as a writer and musician he's tops!
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Although a bit long and with subtitles, this movie held my attention.  Realizing that it is fiction, based loosely upon the one time voyage of a German public affairs officer its depiction of life aboard a WWII U-boat is probably one of the most accurate to date. I work with many maritime historians and we have this near the top of our list.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved it! Its kid friendly and super fun with a fast paced beat that the whole family will enjoy!  I recommend it to kids and even some adults! But the best part are... the ... MINIONS! If you don't like minions, this game is not for you. And if you do not like fast paced games back away now!
B00A5FPQBI|4.0|true to life film, very entertaining. lots of action and violence,good to learn how people live and survive on the streets
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is fun because you can build many things. I have monster traps and enjoy getting on it. Budder is awesome!!!!!! Anyway, this is worth ur seven bucks. But warning does glitch sometimes.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Although there isn't that much originality in the story itself (which is sorta the point, right?), there's much new goodness to love in the setting and the premise. Loved the whole cyborg angle, and Cinder comes across as a very likable character: spunky, vulnerable, down-to-earth, and determined. I would have liked to have seen a little more maturity in the prince, but that's a minor quibble. This is YA, after all!<br /><br />The setting was a delight, the supporting characters (especially Iko) were great, and the overall affect charming. I could have done without the cliffhanger ending, but I will be reading on to the sequel.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved &#34;The Shining,&#34; and this one does not disappoint. Dan has grown up to be a very complex and interesting character, and a wonderfully kind and human one. His relationship with the child, Abba,  is full of wonder and danger. The story just kind of takes you along like the little train, but not always so benign.
B00BECZPI0|5.0|The Walking Dead is one of the best television shows ever created, and this set is a must for any collection. The third season carried on the amazing story of the first two seasons. The third season has action, drama, and comedy. This season continues the great story with very relatable characters. This season they kill off many of the regular characters from the previous seasons, and that can make you sad when they die. This season introduces new characters too. This is a favorite of mine, and thrums up review from me. The action can be seen through not just the shootings and zombies, but just the suspense they find a way to put a action packed spin on it. The drama from the death, emotion, and hard times, is enough to bring compassion for the characters, even knowing it is fictional. The comedy can be seen through the characters with individual personalities and the little ways they are trying to entertain each other in this tragic experience they are in.  If you sit down to watch you will not want to quit until you have watched all the episodes.  There is one huge problem with this, and that is when you are finished it leaves you wanting more.  Two thumbs up!!!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I just love the Twilight series.  I have enjoyed the movies over and over again.  one og the best movies series I have ever watched ( aside for Harry Potter that is)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Candy Crush is on Kindle. Finally!!!!! I have been waiting on this for a while. It is here.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Good!! Card illustrates the ongoing perseverance of a true Military Trainee. Can relate to many scenarios and brings a good example, through scifi entertainment, the hard work of our brothers in arms.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This update is not working on my kindle<br />Please read this and make a new one I need this update
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I have been reading books like 'The Hunger Games' for a while. I read Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and I almost read Twilight. I thought that the endings were the strongest part, especially in Harry Potter, which THG are most compared to. This book gets VERY boring and talks about things that never are explained but has one thing that makes it so you can't stop reading: Peeta. He gets in a weird situation with Snow (not saying what... don't wanna spoil) and it kind of is the whole storyline. It ends too quickly. Gale is COMPLETELY out of her life in the Epilogue, which I think is stupid. It is a good series, but the book has a terrible ending, a bad storyline, and just SUCKS. It does not live up to Catching Fire, what is one of the best books ever in my opinion,
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It doesn't take much to make a boy happy. My son has taken this everywhere and it is quite a conversation starter. Some of the pieces can be removed so we hot glued a piece on that he was afraid he would loose. It did not seem to affect the operation of the toy/pen. Oh I mean screwdriver, my mistake!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Fun, great movie.  Fun for who enjoys aliens and space science fiction movies.  Hope to find more like it.  Enjoy!
B00006FDCD|5.0|I remember watching this when I was younger it was fun watching it again. Classic Stephen King and Tim Curry, love it!!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Good acting and story.  Keeps you guessing about what is happening and a good surprise ending.  Good romance story for those who like both mystery and romance
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I honestly don't feel anything I could say would do this film justice.  It is suspenseful, frightening, touching, and an emotional powerhouse all wrapped into 90 minutes.  I really don't want to spoil the plot.  All you really need to know is that it's about people lost in space, but surviving space isn't what this movie's really about.  It's about life and it is beautiful.<br /><br />I'm not a Sandra Bullock fan, but I thought her performance here was top-notch.  I felt attached to her character from start to finish.  George Clooney, while essentially just playing George Clooney, does a great job as the veteran astronaut who talks her through things, but as far as acting is concerned this is Bullock's movie, no question about it.<br /><br />The visuals here are just incredible.  Not since Kubrick's 2001 has space seemed so beautiful yet terrifyingly deadly.  This movie knows how to capture the beauty and horror of the situations faced by its characters and does it with extraordinary style.  There are long stretches of silence, emphasizing the vacuum of space (as Kubrick did in 2001), but often the movie's best visuals are complimented by an outstanding score by composer Steven Price.<br /><br />As for 3D: This is honestly the only time I've ever felt a movie needed to be seen in 3D.  I have been against 3D ever since James Cameron started this recent trend with 'Avatar', but I'm telling you now: If you can see this movie in 3D don't miss it!  3D feels like it actually enhances the atmosphere and emotions of this film in ways I don't think any other 3D film to date has.  As a whole I'm still against 3D films, but Gravity has shown me that there is a place for 3D movies.<br /><br />Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n ('Children of Men', 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban') has delivered a modern masterpiece.  It is worth seeing in theaters (especially IMAX 3D, as I did) and I feel that when it's on Blu-Ray I'll be analyzing its themes, and visuals for years to come.  Most importantly: I felt genuinely moved by this motion picture.  The scares, the tension, and the emotionally charged climax- it all just rang true for me as a viewer.  Gravity will likely go down as one of 2013's best and is a must-see.t importantly: I felt genuinely moved by this motion picture.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I loved this game it has FUN game play, the graphics are not bad and there a lot of guns(the tier 3 rifle and shotgun are the best).<br /><br />But the one and ONLY thing I can think of that could make this game better would be FASTER UPDATES.<br /><br /> Oh yeah it only took me one week to beat the game
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|I like a lot ,but wish it was longer. It was little short but, I really like playing this game.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is one of the best  I love this show and will watch again next year. One of the best

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very well written and gives everyone something to think about. Very good book and would recommend it. It even gives you demonstrations to show how strong your thoughts are.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I thought it would be tough to top their Revelator CD.  It took me 2 listens to really open my ears.  This CD is just as good.  Susan's voice is awesome; sweet one moment, bluesy, then rough and rocking!  Derek's guitar is pure magic,  Then there is this monster band that is downright perfect.  Must have for anyone!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is okaii but its fun anyways I play it for hours and hours. This game dosen't get boring its fun too.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Wow!<br />Sorry I was a late bloomer on this marriage.  I have a lot of Susan's music, and didn't know Derek as much.  I was shocked at the band's sound.  Huge band, huge sound!  Derek really knows how to inject his solo's.  Susan's voice is awesome.  This is a flawless piece of music.  You need to click on the sample, then add to your collection.  Priceless!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game is a little bit tricky but its still really really fun game to play I hope u have fun playing this to
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Its awesome to see Keith and Mick so humble playing with the legends.  This is a great show.  Pass the bottle Ronnie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is an addicting game and I was waiting for it to come to the Kindle Fire. It plays so much more easier on the Fire - swipe and there you go. No more mouse actions. All my friends are addicted to it and first thing I did when I saw it on Fire was post it to Facebook to let them know.<br />Now my husband will have a hard time getting my Kindle Fire away from me. It is easy to play, addicting, and once you get stuck you can't stop until you are free of that level.<br />Synched my accounts and away we go.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|After watching Ben Harper on the Funk Brothers DVD documentary, I've been waiting for him to soul out.  I recommend you watching the short DVD explaining how this 20-something and this 80 year old got together.  To see them choke up when it hits them that they are sharing the same blues soul is priceless.  Congrats Ben, you created a &#34;Top Shelf&#34; CD.  Please continue with the blues!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to see this on Amazon now. Love playing this on my Kindle Fire HD, the colors just light up. Very addicting game, but helps pass the time. If you haven't played yet, it's worth the try. It's addicting ;)
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|I watch some of this series to see how emergency ethics are treated by the writers. Zombies don't otherwise interest me.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|there is nothing like a classic action movie.wacthed with my father as a kid and watched it with son recently
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you like hard sci fi, you should love this book. Written from the viewpoint of a man marooned by misfortune on Mars with the full expectation that, sooner or later, he's going to die there, it's a brilliantly funny tale of survival.<br /><br />Armed only with the materials at hand, a solid understanding of science and engineering, and determination, Mark Watney refuses to give up. Each step along the way is presented as a problem to be figured out, and the author supplies realistic solutions.<br /><br />No aliens, no wormholes, no inter-dimensional travel. A rock-solid, believable tale that could read as a memoir from the future.<br /><br />Did I mention it was funny, too?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is not a sequel to The Shining, it is the story of what happened after.  Stephen King once again makes me believe the unbelievable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for man by Candy Crush Saga available for Kindle Fire!! Have been waiting and hoping you would!! What a surprise! My hubby and I love the game and play mostly on our phones. But now I can play on my awesome big screen Kindle Fire HD!! It looks amazing, so colorful! I'm still smiling!!! Again, thanks!!!
B003UBTX72|3.0|Very good details on Keith's youth. A good read for Stones fans. An interesting history of an ageing rocker. Keith's memory is surprisingly good.
1451695195|5.0|I loved reading this one doctor's experience with the afterlife.  My experience with doctors, is usually they would never be open to anything not proven through Science but this doctor not only accepts it,  he goes through the process of proving it with all of his knowledge of Science, making it hard for the non-believers to not consider the possibilities.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Film: 4.5/5<br />Video:5/5<br />3D: 4/5<br />Audio: 5/5<br />Supplements: 4/5<br />Package: 2/5<br /><br />Review:<br />I am, by all means, obsessed with collectors, exclusives, specials, limiteds and steelbook editions.  If you're a huge fan of Guillermo Del Toro's ingenious mind than you will be astounded by Pacific Rim's sheer mechanical beauty and colorfully visceral joy ride.  Though I know you aren't reading this to know that but rather, to know if this edition was worth it.  I ordered the Limited Collectors edition purely on a geek high and sadly I am coming down from it.  The idea sounds amazing to have the behemoth Gypsy in your collection but this idea is comprised relatively of hollow plastic.  The 4 disc set (2 Blu Ray discs and 2 DVD discs) are stacked on a flap hinged to the back.  I have found no real issue with this disc placement to be damaging, just merely inconvenient.  Gypsy from the front looks full figured but from the back you will see that it's a hollow mold nicely designed with great depth at the proper angle.  Similar cases have been done with the Watchmen and Batman blu rays but I'd have to say this one looks better and more detailed than those.  Keep in mind, this package is not the same size as the standard blu-ray case if you leave it within the clearly printed package.  It extends almost an inch more in height, width and depth making in stand out in its clear casing from the rest of your collection.  For the die hard fan of films I am, I enjoy supporting the ones that deserve it and Pacific Rim blew away the original concept I thought it presented.  I paid $34.99+taxes and still feel that the 3D blu ray package is more appealing and will end up buying it once the price has become worthy of a double dip.  This edition absolutely does not merit a $64.99 MSRP by all means and hopefully will get an honestly accurate edition in a steelbook re-release...maybe four with each Jaeger (Sadly, I would probably by all four).  With Guillermo havingalready written the sequel, I hope for a trilogy to be established and a brilliant box set announced.  On a last note...Ultraviolet?! Why must the best be UV only.  I mean I have the blu-ray, so no qualms, I just want to add this to my already existing iTunes collection. I've grown exhausted attempting even to redeem a code for UV and can't help feel a tad incomplete leaving even one code floating in digital expiration space.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|this is a great sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;.  Well-written (of course) and definitely holds my attention--can't wait to get home from work to pick up where I left off!
B0002KQNL8|3.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid so I decided to buy this movie for Halloween this year. It was not as great as I had remembered it to be. It wasn't bad but there was far too much over the top screaming and it wasn't nearly as funny as I remembered. This movie wasn't great but it was entertaining enough and had some fun scenes that made it worth watching. It was nice to watch a fun horror film without nudity as well. I recommend this movie to people who enjoy cheesy 80's horror. It was worth the $5 I paid for it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's Candy Crush Saga. I think enough people KNOW what it is. Fun, addictive social media game. One of the few where I don't feel pressured to buy anything.<br /><br />It's about damn time it's on Kindle!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Wonderfully motivating book not only concerning women but also their partners. I could simply not stop nodding my head while reading.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|loving it, great, wonderful  my granddaughter love it  and my adult kids  even me ... what it for a long time
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Well written, strong actors, and great chemistry. I will buy and watch this again. I hope there's a part two...
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The entire family loves to play this game. Its cool that we can gift items to each other. Don't like that it freezes up a lot on my kindle. Works great on Pc but does freeze up occasionally which is why I gave the four stars. They have been pretty good at crediting when that happens however. :)
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I think that many people will really like this book.  It's a story about a woman who has bad things happen to her and then follows a very destructive path before turning it all around as she hikes the west coast equivalent of the Appalachian Trail.  It's a story of perseverance and of finding oneself--kind of.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found the author's tale of self-discovery and her self-described foibles annoying rather than endearing.  Her pack is too heavy because she doesn't really know what to take with her.  She continuously reminds us that she didn't really plan this trip as well as she could have--well, I guess she did read a book about it first.  Planning is not really her thing.  She even changed her last name to Strayed on a whim.<br /><br />I think it is difficult for me to empathize with a person who chooses a path of self-destruction in the face of grief.  If I were in the same situation, I cannot say that I would behave differently, but I feel that while the author is forthcoming about her faults, she maintains an emotional distance which makes them seem like excuses rather than the emotional outbursts they must have been at the time.  She feels bad about cheating on her husband--kind of--but, the narrator describes the situation as though it were completely rational at the time.  Oops...I cheated, but I was really sad, so it's no big deal.  It is the same with her drug use.  She says that she took drugs, but in her hindsight narrative, she treats it as though it were just something she was experimenting with and could quit at any time.  She similarly discusses her trip from this distant narrative perspective.  She acknowledges some of the mistakes she makes, but you never get the sense that she tries to fix them--she just moves on to the next instant of poor judgment.  And, it's a long trail.<br /><br />Again, I believe that many people will enjoy this book.  They will applaud her honesty--especially about those things which make her a bit of a vile character, including cheating on and pushing away her ex-husband, her heavy drug use, and her lack of preparation for her trip.  They will find her details of the trail (and her story of walking with blisters, having very little money, having the wrong supplies, and sleeping in the rain) inspiring.  I respect that.  I just didn't enjoy the book as well as they will.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The reason for the 2 star is because this product does allow you to watch your videos from your devices, however it's typically videos from YouTube and Netflix. I tried streaming online movies and it would not show on my TV because the video is not compatible with Chromecast. In addition, I can't even watch videos on my phone or desktop directly. I would only recommend this if you only want to watch Netflix and YouTube.
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|Nice to have two ports to charge both phones at once or phone/tablet, etc.  Doesn't seem to charge our devices any faster than the cheapy chargers we're trying to replace.
B00123NWKE|5.0|Awesome..every track is simply the best!  DAvid Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Tommy Bolen..rock star hall of fame.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  BUY IT!!!
B00F8L2VO4|3.0|Not far enough into it yet.  It starts a little too simply.  I expect it to improve.  An inexpensive way to start learning a different language.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoyed playing the game and play every day almost. I like the fact you get updates on a regular basis.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I like all the variety it provides.  Excellent way to look up some things.  It's easy to read.  A good addition for the Kindle.
B00FEN000S|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It reminded me of a reality based version of Power Rangers. Had me shouting for the good guys!
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Fun movie for some comic Halloween relief. No slashing or incredible gore here. I would not recommend it for children under 8 though, it still may be a little scary for their age group. It is a classic and if you like comedy with a little edge...buy this one!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Caught me off guard completely.  I couldn't put it down after it was revealed.  Definitely recommend this book. Saw it in People magazine.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Take a fantastic journey to another realm of reality in the beautiful prose of &#34;The Night Circus&#34;.  This is a story that requires a willingness to suspend disbelief.  Then, take a long clearing breath and enter this magical world of wonder, mystery and romance.  It is unique.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not a bad game but it could use some better aspects and not force you to rate it or like or follow it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so addictive...I found myself sitting playing this on my kindle as well as my phone for long periods of time.  I would highly recommend this mind teasing game.
B001AW156U|5.0|i couldn't stand playing gta5 for another minute with the awful ps3 trigger buttons. Holding them down for driving and shooting all the time was just too much... This fixes alll of that... now u can drive n shoot for hours on end
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Boring dialog, weird music. More like a cartoon than a movie..<br />That was such a magical period in history but it did not come thru in the movie
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Wow! this must be the season for everybody to get married, but they are so cute together and Castle is sooo funny. I am glad that Kate is back at the precinct
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Loved the first season and we are watching the second. Funny, yet poignant<br />The actors are all great. We love it
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Great Album. Songs get stuck in your head all day. Just saw them in Cincinnati a few weeks ago and was amazed at how good they sound live also.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I know these are written as more of a 'teen' book, but even as an adult I enjoyed them.  There is alot of death and some 'adult' like topics in the book, so if I were a parent, I'd make sure I'd read it before giving it to my child, but overall I liked it.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory is never a disappointment.  This was every bit as good as The White Queen and The Red Queen.
B005KIQDYE|5.0|Lovely product that &#34;make my daughter's day&#34; completely. Always fan of Lego, but sad that not many choices available for global delivery!!!!  Why amazon?  Why?
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I enjoyed the film.  It was long without feeling too long.<br /><br />Though if I never had to hear Russell Crowe's singing again, I'd be okay.
B004BSFC46|5.0|I loved these rattles.  It was fun to attach them to our granddaughters wrists and watch her look at them.<br />I highly recommend them.
B00BU18U82|5.0|If you enjoy simulator games and are a kid at heart, this is a fun game to pass time. Multiple items to keep you busy. I don't know why there are cars on the road other than to get in your way. It would seem to me they could have put a little more thought into selling the crops, why do I use a tractor to drive there? It seems like a truck would be more efficent. The controls are little difficult to get use to also. The game has some quirks, but it is fun.
B004GKMV3Y|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella novels - they are perfect for escaping and relaxing. Enjoyable without a lot of work, and genuinely funny.  I do find myself actually laughing when I read her books.<br />I have read them all and none disappoint!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|If you like heart wrenching books, this is it.  The characters were easy to get to know and love.  I will read more of Vanessa Diffenbaugh's books.  Great discussion for our book club!
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played those crazies who gave this one star are probably working for mojang ( creaters of minecraft ) but this is seriously the best game I have ever played
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Never saw the show before.....now I am hooked!!  By far, one of the funniest shows out there today.....freakin hysterical show
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great book, but was expecting more horror since the media kept branding it as King's &#34;first true horror in years!&#34;. It wasn't really scary at all, but it was a great read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|AT first I thought that I would be bored with just going from room to room. But goodness I was wrong this game is fun
B009LDD5E0|4.0|This is Cory Monteith's last season with Glee and these DVDs are all we fans have left to remember him by. Keep singing with the angels, Cory. We will all miss you.<br /><br />P.S. One of my favorite moments from season 4 was when it seemed like Finn beat up Brody in the \\"Feud\\" episode and said \\"Stay away from my future wife!\\"
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this app forever! My sister has it on her Samsung Galaxy Tablet, and i have been waiting for it for my kindle fire hd! Now that its out, i havent put it down! This is so fun and entertaing. Definitely 5 star rating.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This amplifier is much smaller than I thought it was going to be. Similar to the size of a half dollar coin. I use Bose AE2 headphones and my laptop and android phone just wasn't loud enough on them. Once I plugged in the amp, the sound is much more clearer and louder. No distortion. Its not going to make it &#34;ears bleeding&#34; kind of loud, but it is still a great difference. For its price and size, you really cant complain, not to mention that it has its own rechargeable battery built in.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The best game ever I love to play this game. If you see this review you should try the game
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|A very good and easy read that looks to have a good future. Looking forward to next book in the series
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book tells it like it was for the front line Marine who fought to give us all the freedom we enjoy today.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The start may be a bit tricky and some readers may drop the book but you will be quicly immersed in this world
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|addictive and why wouldn't you want to play with the minions :) other than the fact that the game freezes on me sometimes ... it could be my kindle.... id be playing whenever i get the chance
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank You  amazon for finally putting this on the Kindle Fire. I was so dissapointed when I got mine, because you didn't have the game/app. Love this game and is very addicting. Now you need to work on getting the Pet Rescue Saga game.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I got seasons 1 and 2 together so that I would be ready for season 3. Now I am so addicted to the series that I am practically counting down for the next season!
B005LAIGYQ|2.0|Propaganda. That is the best and the only way to describe this movie. Propaganda.<br /><br />Act of Valor must have been made by the American army. I don't mean it as a joke nor am I being sarcastic. I sincerely believe in my heart of hearts that this movie was either commissioned by the Pentagon or the producers had approached the American government and said: \\"Give us access to military equipment and money and we will make you a propaganda movie like you have not seen since World War II.\\"<br /><br />I do realize that all movies that are made with the help from the military have to portray the army in good light. Would you help filmmakers make a movie if their movie would portray you as a bad person? But Act of Valor does not show the army in good light - it worships it.<br /><br />Act of Valor is about a team of Navy Seals who find themselves pitted against a Chechen terrorist mastermind. Not surprisingly, the terrorist is a radical Muslim. Since 9/11, nine out of ten movies have a villain who is a radical Muslim extremist. This terrorist mastermind is working with an arms dealer. In Costa Rica, an undercover CIA agent (who looks like a supermodel and is played by a supermodel) uncovers some evidence linking the said arms dealer and the Chechen terrorist. She is kidnapped and tortured and the Seals are sent to rescue her. After they do so (after a battle, of course), they learn that the terrorist is planning to infiltrate a number of suicide bombers into the United States. This forces the Seals to head for Mexico where they try to intercept the suicide bombers. However, the terrorist is paying the Mexican drug cartels for protection, which results in not one but two battles. How this ends, I will not say to avoid spoilers, but don't expect any twist endings or shocking revelations.<br /><br />The main characters are the Navy Seals. I must say that it has been long time since I've seen such bad acting. I am a very forgiving viewer when it comes to acting. I don't expect Oscar-winning style performances in all the movies that I watch. As long as the acting is passable, I will enjoy any movie as long as the plot, the characters (their psychology and interactions) and the dialogues are good. In Act of Valor the acting is so horrendously bad that I could barely stand it.<br /><br />I could even forgive the bad acting if the rest of the movie was good, but the portrayal of the Seals is absurd. They spend their free time doing nothing but showing and telling each other how much they love their families, each other, their country and how great America is. We get long, sappy speeches about duty, honor and strong family values. Their dialogues, when not about technical military matters, are inane and completely unrealistic.<br /><br />The problem is not that the Navy Seals in Act of Valor love their country and families. I am sure that almost all real-life Seals do too. The problem is that the Act of Valor Seals are living, breathing propaganda machines who do only two things - fight and promote America and family values. Their behavior and personalities are so wooden and unrealistic that halfway through the movie I stopped thinking of them as human beings. And, this also means that when they get hurt or die in the movie, I completely don't care.<br /><br />The bad guys, on the other hand, were quite good. I enjoyed watching scenes with them and found them to be quite realistic. Granted, they are horribly flawed human beings at best and sociopaths at worst, but that is what makes them human. Such people (sadly) really do exist in real world. The Seals, as shown in this movie, are too unrealistic to be accepted as anything than G.I. Joe action figures made flesh.<br /><br />Coming to think of it, it is quite an achievement for a hardcore pro-America, pro-Navy Seals, pro-war propaganda movie to make the foreign-born villains more interesting than the American heroes. While watching the movie I never went as far as to root for the bad guys, but I preferred to watch scenes with them rather than with the Americans.<br /><br />The movie has one, and only one, redeeming quality, and that is the combat scenes. The Navy Seals, as human beings, might come out as completely unrealistic, but when in battle, they do fight like professionals. The battle scenes are very well done with real professionalism. The battle cinematography is a masterful blend of hyper realistic, almost documentary-like shots and action movie moments. The fight scenes are full of fast action and adrenaline, but at the same time they are realistic and you can easily follow what is happening. They are also professionally done from the military and tactical point of view. This is more or less how special forces fight in real life and the movie avoids all those clichés that you can find in action movies.<br /><br />In conclusion, while this movie is great when it comes to action scenes, the rest of it is little more than nauseating propaganda. Overall, unless you are interested in special forces combat techniques and want to use this movie as research material, I would recommend that you skip it. I give it only two stars.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|I needed a replacement for my standard lens cap that I lost. This fit perfect and is complete with the Olympus so it doesn't look like a cheap knock off.
B007SGM084|5.0|What a very interesting trilogy.  However, I do think this book would be inappropriate for certain age groups.  The serious has a very real plot line that keeps you captivated!!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I heard the series was good but was reluctant to spend the money on the discs. It was so worth it!!! GOT is awesome; if you are hesitant, don't be!
B00005B4GT|5.0|This is a very nice copy of radiohead's best CD great quality LPs the only thing I wish I could change is that this is the only 10&#34; album I have I wish it was a 12&#34; so it would fit in better with the rest but not a big deal
B00957T6X6|5.0|The HBO series got me hooked on the story, but the books add so much depth (yes, I know they are the basis of the show). The books are long, and tend to consume me. The writing is excellent and the story is addictive. I love this series.
0812983459|4.0|I heard about this book from book club members, although this wasn't the chosen book.<br />I immediately ordered it because I knew Amazon would be best and fastest source to deliver!<br />Okay, I am a Prime member, honestly I love it!<br />ABOUT the book!  I loved it!<br />Maybe I am biased because I was born and raised in England where the subject of the book started his pilgrimage however I think everyone can find something here that they might relate to!<br />It's not a romance, mystery, thriller or history novel however the author manages to make this all of this!<br />Truly enjoyable and thoughtful read.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have been so disgusted by the True Blood TV show and it's wandering away from the original Sookie stories.  I love it when Charlaine herself continues the saga.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|I've got a Kindle Fire HD.  The game HUD (menu items) covered over some of the clues which you needed to click on to play and continue the game; Very frustrating.  I quit playing after 10 minutes of fighting with the HUD.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|This game is addictive. It's the appropriate level of difficulty. Most levels are passable but every so often you get a real humdinger, and since the level is random you never know when it will happen. It's definitely re-playable once you finish it.
B001O53BKG|5.0|I Loved it. Very Funny and Great music.  Teddy Geiger is a fantastic artist! Glad I purchased instead of renting.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A bit different than their other games...and I really like it. In app purchasing is more than I like to pay but it's ok.....some of the games are getting repetitive.
B00104W8T6|5.0|What can I say great sound track great condition, they have wonderful voices, catchy songs loved the movie, loved the actors.  If you also like the movie, I would go for the sound track too!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like the clock. The only problem is trying to figure how to change the time. Overall it is a good app.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Worth the wait for the sequel. I could not put the book down. I am planning on reading again after I finish reading The Shining.
B00AAZSH0U|3.0|he prefers real books because if he 'turns' the wrong direction, he gets adds for other recommended books. next time I will get him an audio book
B00F96P8S4|5.0|good solid cher love her any time any where she just keeps on getting better as time goes on although not her very best it aint bad
B0089LOG02|5.0|This wonderful story kept me so engrossed, I couldn't put it down.  This is a must read for everyone.  Thank you Ms. Kline for weaving this tale that is based on our history.
B005UKK4Y2|4.0|In need of a good laugh?  This movie is hilarious with several laugh out loud moments!  It has an all-star cast with some in roles you never seen before (Jennifer Anniston)!
1484021851|5.0|Very good book with lots of good examples and specific hints about how to improve your talks and speeches<br />Liked it!!!
B003YCI1O8|5.0|Not sure what it is about this movie but I laugh to myself during nearly 90% of the movie. \\"Running's not a plan, running is what you do when a plan fails..\\"  I think it was the chemistry of Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon.  They just seemed like two peas in a pod in this movie.  Add in Michael Gross's performance as the hard core libertarian gun nut and this one ended up being a PERFECT B movie classic.  The one liners, the dopey underground monsters...can't beat it if you have no need to watch something serious.  I saw this movie when I was about 14 with one of my best friends.  We both still remember seeing it in the theaters and having a great time.  The Blu-Ray is a fantastic way to re-visit if you are looking for the same nostalgia.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Maybe a must read for Jack Reacher fans-this establishes how and when he became a wondering, somewhat disfunctional hero-this story is hard to put down and has some interesting twists that keep you involved with each and every page-not Lee Child's best of the Reacher series but still worth while.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|But in the few books I have read, this is one of the best. Though I have watched all the seasons available, there is only so much that can be put into the show. These books are an awesome read, very hard to put down.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is sad in haunting in many ways but a joy to read at the same time.  That is ultimately the book's message, that life can be lovely even in the worst circumstances.  Highly recommended.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book is an incredible insight into the psyche of North Korea and how they control their people.  A must read for modern civilization.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Stephen King!  It's been awhile since I reread The Shining but this book stands on its own. It was fun to visit with the old haunts again, and meet some new even better ones or should I say worse.
0385350864|1.0|If possible, I would give it one half of star. Stupid, boring, awful, shallow (much more than shallow!) attempt to earn some money with former success.<br />Save forest!!! Don't print it more. In comparison with it &#34;50 Shades of Grey&#34; is definitely a masterpiece.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|A really good read could not wait to read the 3rd book in the Clifton Chronicles, a good book for a wet Weekend
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is one of the best DVD's I have seen in a long time. No wonder Sandra Bullock won an acadamy award. And to make it even better it was based on a true story!
B002AWX6UM|4.0|A powerful tale of how tragedy and desperation lead the author to life as a soldier at a very tender age and his road to redemption.
B001N4OX82|5.0|I love his acting ability but to me this was the the &#34;one&#34; for Brad. I loved all the drama, and yet his gentleness with his lady co-star. Thats why I qrdered it for my collection!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You can play for hours and not know it.  Very enjoyable, fun.  Habit forming.  Easy to learn.  Very artistic and colorful.  LOVE IT!!
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Very good action film with development of characters being secondary but not absent.  Definitely entertaining.in a way that makes the comic book characters come alive.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I downloaded this app to be able to view notes and presentations for school. It is very easy to use and I never have any issues opening files with it. I like that you can make spreadsheets as well
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed the challenges of escaping. Just wish there were more levels. Nice way to kill time in the Dr. office
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book made me think before I react and I now try to figure out why i am really upset.
B009BK67PW|1.0|I really didn't understand why I was watching it and not tracking down the creator and the actors and beating them with their own dismembered arms instead.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really well written, but what do you expect from King. You finally get to know what happened to that kid from the shining.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one great sequel to one of Stephen King's masterpieces The shining.  Great characters and a perfect way to say whatever happened to Danny Torrance
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the receipes, crafts, and decorating! So many wonderful ideas! The ease of use is wonderful! I highly recommend using Pinterest  !
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The critics were blind when they rated this.  This is a great follow up to the rebooted Star Trek.  While some would say why, I say why not
B009WUBERW|1.0|I've got to admit that I didn't get past the first 30 minutes but it was just another violent movie (which as a rule doesn't bother me) but the dialog was bad and the acting was bad too.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The truth about the origins and development of Christianity has set me free from my irrational ties to it.  I'm much more relaxed now when I enter a church or cathedral, less intimidated.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|Fast shipping and new as described.  Great movie and true story especially locally in NC since Robin Gatewood who is still MIA was on this plane.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Entertaining look inside a Manhattan law firm, with characters , who although have faults, manage to do the right thing and get the job done.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Without doubt one of my favorite artists that I listen to on Spotify, but I also like supporting artists I like by buying their music. Certain songs resonate so succinctly with their music and the lyrics are heart wrenching at times.<br /><br />I'm not really a Music-ophile but love deep bass tones in music such as the National.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers I  my favourite because  every time I play it very month of a holiday it always going on tour an  u can get pumpkins and going to new Orleans and China and las Vegas you guys need to do one in Texas or in oklahoma
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Quite different in his approach to music. Not music to sleep by, but more for a Sunday morning house cleaning, upbeat kind of music..
B002QYUV5M|4.0|humorous and entertaining picture that seems to be a hidden and fairly unknown picture with a great cast, well done
B00DJZ06DO|3.0|you get what you pay for but after reading the reviews about the nonsensical direction this remake has taken, i'd gladly go this route again.
B000005RSW|5.0|Bought this for my husband for his ipod...he loves it, loaded it on to his ipod as soon as it arrived.
B004XQO90O|4.0|Jake Gyllenhall does a good job as Cpt. Colter Stevens who awakes in a train bound for Chicago.  He is sitting across from Christina, a very pretty woman who seems to know him.  The train explodes and he awakens in a metal capsule speaking with Cpt. Goodwin who is encouraging him to find the bomber!<br /><br />The movie is much better than the summary.  This is not one of those films that plods along.  This is face-paced action, time travel and a love story.  There is good acting, good directing, and a good story.  This is definitely worth watching on a Saturday with a big bowl of popcorn!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Outstanding, couldn't put it down once I started reading it. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new Sci-Fi story line. Looking forward to reading all books in the Quintet.
B005FITIGO|5.0|WOW!  Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Paul Bettany, Demi Moore, Zachary Quintos and more!  These people and a taut, riveting, heart-pounding script keep your attention, as well as you on the edge of your seat, through this entire film.  A huge investment corporation discovers they played hard and fast with too much paper and have to make some soul-destroying decisions.  It is so difficult to even give the plot of this movie without giving too much away.  This is people at their very worst and some who can't stand what is happening and try to get through their everyday business carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders.<br /><br />This is a must-see!  Especially in today's time and economy!  I highly, highly recommend Margin Call!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game totally recommend it please do get it so fun<br />I love playing it but it's addictive<br />Lol don't become like me
B003O86FMW|4.0|looking forward to the movie.<br />Loved the idea of continuation at the end. Must get 3rd book in sequel for sure.<br />Good writing and storyline.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I couldn't have imagined a more well timed book for our generation. I look forward to what's next from Ms. Sandberg.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Engaging & witty, keeps you guessing while you soak up the suspense.  First TV series recommended by my niece that I got into. Apparently appealing to a wide age group.
B000FC130E|5.0|This  was  an excellent  read. The  concept was fun  and made you go hmmm... just a little bit. I absolutely love all his stories!
B000I0XLYO|1.0|I thought the movie was funny at first until too many dirty and sexual jokes and references for my taste.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I am a huge sci-fi reader and rarely find anything recent to enjoy. I usually don't care for short stories because they feel rushed. I was pleasantly surprised with \\"Galactic Energies\\". The stories were delicious and I want to consume more...Would like to have the last story end....but didn't keep me from giving it 5 stars!
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Such a good story. This movie has been at the top of my list for almost 20 years now. I love how Forrest Gump is weaved into so many major events.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Well done.  I like the integrated weather and dimming feature. I look forward to learning more.  Easy to use - intuitive
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love game.  My four kids love this game.  Even my four year old can play this game.  She loves playing it, she's just not very good at it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The only author I pre-order books for. Have been reading him since my teens. Slept with a rosary for a week after Carrie!  This book is the same for me as all the others; I'm hooked from page one and can't wait to pick it up again at the end of the day-
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received the item as promised in perfect condition much earlier than promised<br />It worked as expected<br />I am happy on this purchase
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I give this 3 stars because it's fun for a while (being able to connect your Google account to it and everything) but then it will star buffering a lot and it won't respond a lot more often so yeah... on a side note I got this on my kindle fire HD
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  If you've read Fifty Shades of Grey and loved it, you will definitely love this.  They're very similar but the Crossfire series doesn't get too explicit with the sex talk.  A definite read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love the crossfire series! I would definitely recommend them! I can't wait for the 4th book to come out! Every book of this series gets you hooked & don't want to stop reading!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book as I was not aware of the number of orphans that were sent on trains to the Midwest. The links to history were very informative. The story of what a little child had to experience, before finding a loving home was heart breaking and heart warming. When people struggle in life, reading about other's struggles gives you hope and courage that the human spirit is so resilient.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I had a set and then my niece destroyed this one watching it so much.  Just bought it again to make a complete set!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Tim Burton's blending of American's two favorite holidays result in a scare-fest my elementary-aged boys loved. Cleverly written musical numbers punctuate the stop-motion animation reminiscent of the Rankin Bass holiday classics.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|I love everything about this game as hidden object games are my favorite. love the different ways to find the objects.  Wish it could last forever
1451695195|3.0|Book is okay more suited for individuals  that do not or are questioning if there is or is not a God. It is a slow read not, can't put it down  material.
B001F7AXKE|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a dear friend. She and i have both visited concentration camps.Hers was Auschwitz, and my visit was Dachau. I was there twice. I really wanted to read this book. Haven't had a chance to start reading yet, but from her recommendation, i am looking forward to it.. ,
B003G4W49C|4.0|I saw the previews for the upcoming movie and decided to read the book.  Found it very intriguing hard to put down.  Liked it very much.  Looking forwards to seeing the movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is fun and challenging. I've only just begun to play. It is different from most other hidden object games I have played...Looking forward to solving the mysteries of this game.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My friends got me into this movie and I think I will own them all or as many as they create.  It's for the kids AND grown-ups!  I even teared up at the end of this movie.  I can be a light weight when it comes to a moving scene!  It is hilarious!!  Enjoy!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It has been a very good device so far, I really love the simplicity of use.<br /><br />The phone app has been a little bit buggy at times (freezing, or not working in 4.3 on my t999). But when everything does work, it's fantastic. I am wondering how long it will take to get more thrid party apps for it (like Playon).<br /><br />If the bugs get worked out fully, and more third party apps become available, I will probably buy one for every TV I own and suggest them to friends and family.<br /><br />Also, a small pet peave, I wish the micro USB power cord connected at a different location so that it wouldn't be visible under the tv. And, as long as I'm making feature requests, it would be fabulous to have a headphone audio out jack to use it as a music streaming device (with older amps, etc).
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Thank you for a book that grabbed me from the first sentence.  You trapped me in the mystery I was even guessing who was who. The mystery was there all the way to the end wanted to know what the out come was but did not want it to end then went out on Amazon and found it was not ending just yet yeah. Hubby went and bought me the next so I could keep going.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Very cute..funny and touching....whole family enjoyed it...good moral to an entertaining story with great characters. ...thumbs up!...a  good pick for family movie night with the kids.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Excellent product is very good, works fine I have no problem with its use, which is recommended for all .
B00F91RYL8|1.0|THe plot line was incoherent<br />Think abt World War I Mass Atacks by zombie like Infanty<br />were absolutely destroyed. So killing a few hundred thousand massed zombies should present<br />few technical problems. Surviving a plane crash within walking destination of your journey?<br />Was this suppose be some sort of metaphor focused on Israel? I just do not know It was a stupid movie
B001QFZADA|4.0|This book has helped me to utilize others love languages to develop my relationship with them. It truly gave me a perspective and insight I did not have before.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|Way too much Alan.  Cooper and Helms sleepwalk through the movie.  A plot so already done it was unspeakably bad.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I liked this book because it helped to understand who women in high posistion has been managing their roles, their families and the will to lead and give an example. There were many questions that I have that were answered with this book.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is may favorite of all his albums.  I can listen to it all day.  It's breathtaking.  It's beautifully done as always.  A must have in your library.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Takes too long to accumulate coins and stuff that falls should count whether it falls on the side or the front
B00B69UQEO|5.0|One of the best yet! I say ONE OF because yes, there is Violator.  But if you liked Violator you will immensely enjoy this album along with the extras.  The extras are a must and should have gone on the album in my opinion.  Any true DM fan will fall in love with this album.  Brilliant work.  Once again.  Way to go DM! Looking forward to the next one!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I hate to see this alarm in the morning, but I hate to see any alarm when it goes off.  All that being said the blue light has a great dimming feature. The wake up alarm is not obnoxious as was my previous alarm clock app.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Don't tell anyone how much I like this album, they would not understand. My last 2 music purchases were Kendrick Lamar and Run The Jewels (although Run The Jewels was a free download, I would have paid for it so it counts). If you have ears do them a favor and get this album.
B002QVZ71I|4.0|Heart warming story. It was good to watch when you want to see the underdog do something really spectacular. Yep.
B00FGH3TGO|4.0|Did not know about Lorde until Royals was on the radio. Now that I've found her I'll never let her go.  That right there sounded creepy,  but I meant it as a fan of her music, not in the \\"chain you in my basement and make you sing for me\\" kinda way. Good music for my discerning tastes.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was the first book of near-death experiences I have ever read.  I was wondering about the afterlife when a loved one fell ill.  The author presents the story well and intertwines it with not only his experiences as a neurosurgeon, but with the current knowledge of neuroscience. The struggle to describe what he has experienced contributed to the humanity of this book. He doesn't bore you with science and attempts in many ways to describe what must be a foreign concept to all of us. I will admit since it is the first book of this sort I have read that I don't have much to compare it to.<br />Ultimately, this book put my mind at ease. I'm glad I've stumbled on this one first because he has a great list of other reading suggestions if you want to delve deeper.
1401938906|3.0|Well I really liked the book and believed the reasoning behind it.  I was feeling great thinking I was going to begin taking my life by the coattails.  I did the first experiment and even though I felt very confident that it would work....it didn't.  That burst my balloon and I haven't gone back to the book yet.  I feel now that I won't have the same confidence in the experiments and that in itself will render them less likely to work.
039916409X|5.0|I could hardly wait until October 10th when this book came out!! I love Margaret Lynch and her very practical way of presenting EFT for money. She guides us to results! This is a great book- I bought one for me and one to give away. Plus, I and friends will be attending her seminar in Boston in March! Margaret Lynch is the Best!!
0307742997|5.0|Bedtime reading turned into late night reading as  I read &#34;just one more chapter&#34; of the Snowman.  My conclusions were faulty and Nesbo kept me in suspense until the end.  Great writing style.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|It's An Older Movie So I Knew The Picture Quality Was Going To Be The Same But The Sound Definately Approved And All The New Features For The 30th Anniversary Were Cool

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Happiest day for Candy Crush Fans with a Kindle Fire. Wont rate it five stars because it took too long to get on the store. Works fine on KFHD7.  Really happy with this game now available, been waiting ever since I got my tablet,
B0089EHWQE|5.0|While this book is about a very sensitive topic, it certainly has given me a new perspective on the trials that some people have to go through.  I would definitely recommend this book.  Congratulations to Jojo Moyes for writing such an moving story.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting and first it was on androids now it on kindle so I'm very happy about that.
B0064Z8O80|4.0|It is worth listening to. I liked their earlier stuff because it was more unprocessed and was really why they were good from the beginning.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is awesome. All I have to say is read it. It's even better that the first book. READ
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Great movie. I like movies that are filmed on the east coast (Boston,Philly,New York), they seem to have a more gritty feel to them than other places. Anyway, the whole cast was excellent, and Affleck has turned into a pretty, damn good actor, and storyteller. If your interested in a quality, well acted action/drama type of film, than you can't go wrong with this. Enjoy!!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|GREAT GAMEEE You need to read a little but overall this is one of the BEST games on the Amazon store. Recommended has all different kinds of cards you can battle. Only down fall is that if you don't have it the get it!
0380730405|5.0|This is a beautifully written classic. The mystery within a mystery was captivating and the thick underlying tension that runs throughout was gripping.  I loved the marvelous way Daphne du Maurier depicted the time period and how she wonderfully highlighted it with all the pomp and circumstance of the day.  The characters were all very refined and their personalities were truly genuine and believable, I really felt connected and engrossed with them and this great story.<br /><br />The narration was top notch and am looking forward to listening to more of Anna Massy's work. Highly recommend this enchanting book.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love playing this game. It is realistic and fun playing folks from all over the country. North, South, East, West , Uno is the best!!!

B001F6ZIXC|1.0|I know lots of people who are addicted to Sons of Anarchy, so I was really looking forward to getting into it. Ugh... WRONG! It's a soap opera, except instead of Port Charles or Pleasant Valley, you're in Nowhere, California with a bunch of smoking bikers (not smoking hot, mind you - just smoking).<br /><br />In the first episode, we have: 1) a junkie giving birth prematurely; 2) the junkie's vengeful ex-mother-in-law who tries to poison her; 3) a protagonist torn between the violent will of his mother and stepfather and the do-good righteousness of his deceased father (which he learns about by reading his dead father's journal); 4) a former girlfriend with a shady past who somehow has become a DOCTOR (even though she looks to be about 20);  and 5) an assortment of black and bandito rival gangs, some dead illegal alien hookers, an explosion in a weapons & ammo storage shed, and a bunch of corrupt cops. OH! I almost forgot to mention the Elvis impersonators. (Who WRITES this stuff?!)<br /><br />Don't bother with this show - you can't get those hours of your life back. Sons of Anarchy is nothing more than One Life to Live, or All My Children, or As The World Turns.... with bikers.<br /><br />If you're a soap opera fan who wants to pretend you're not (by wrapping your voyeurism in smoke and violence), then this is the show for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Highly Recommended.  This book was very touching.  I read it in two days and then read it again.  Warning: You will also need to purchase a box of tissues.
B003ES61EE|1.0|What I received was a polishing tip that was a VERY SMALL RECTANGLE.<br />These pens are NOT useable for cleaning lenses of any size, except maybe a small viewfinder.<br />My recommendation is not to buy this product.<br />The product photo is very misleading!!!<br />I am going to return the two I ordered.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|Trivium have always been sort of a sore subject within the metal community. Musically everyone involved has been top notch musicians but there was always something lacking within their records, rather it be on the production end or the band's constant search for their identity. Today they have released their 6th album &#34;Vengeance Falls&#34;. Let me just say now, if you loved the Trivium's more extreme technical material then you will be highly disappointed. However, if you are into big production and clean vocals then this is the record for you.<br /><br />Trivium seemed to have peaked on their 2008 effort Shogun. It was their most technical record to date with the thrash influence brought forth on &#34;The Crusade&#34; being expanded upon with a return to the band's metal-core sections at times. When 2010's &#34;In Waves&#34; came out I was slightly disappointed because although I expected them to make a more radio-friendly record they seemingly compromised their identity. When I heard Vengeance Falls for the first time I was blown away because this record had the catchy stripped down elements that In Waves had without the boring vocal sections and for the first time in a while more intricate solos and lyrics.<br /><br />The singles released for this record were &#34;Strife&#34; and &#34;Brave This Storm&#34;. These seemed to be the weakest tracks on the record because they were more mid paced and felt like In Waves B-Sides with less screaming. It's a smart marketing tool to draw in a more broader group of metal-heads. After all, the record features Disturbed frontman David Draiman in the producers seat. To many, this seemed like a bad decision but give the whole album a chance before you judge. It has actually made the band more creative and ready to take on the arena crowd.<br /><br />&#34;Brave This Storm&#34; is the band's opening track and let me just say I did not like it first listen. It has slowly grown on me but what is so off putting about it is the basic guitar riffs. I hear a lot of groove metal influence as well as a blatant David Draiman ripoff in the verse melody. It's the most radio that Trivium has ever sounded yet you can still bang your head to it. The solo is pretty flashy which had me convinced that this was going to be a more creative effort with the lead-work compared to &#34;In Waves&#34;.<br /><br />Next up on the album is the title track. This song caught me by surprise because I just imagined how well it would go over in arenas. The riffs remind me of Machine Head and DevilDriver.  Vocalist Matt Heafy shines here lyrically with more poetic hooks and his vocals sound stronger than they ever have. This song doesn't sound like a Disturbed &#34;rip-off&#34; so kudos.<br /><br />&#34;Strife&#34; is the band's first attempt at working with Matt Heafy's lower range. I love the layering of singing and whispers on the verses. My only complaint is the chorus riff didn't have enough leadwork to make up for the fact that it's basically the bridge on &#34;Built to Fall&#34; off of their last record. &#34;No Way To Heal&#34; comes up next and will kill any doubts that Trivium are writing just for the radio. This song has the most technical drumming that I have ever heard drummer Nick Augusto do in his time in Trivium and the riffs are reminiscent of Dream Theater or August Burns Red. Guitar nerds will geek out on the solo sections and their is also some thrash and more uptempo elements within the song.<br /><br />&#34;To Believe&#34; is a bit different. It's one of the more faster songs on the album but the vocal melodies on this one are undoubtedly Disturbed influenced. It's a busy song with a lot of shreddy guitar licks and a monstrous bass tone. Next up is &#34;At The End of This War&#34; which starts off with an acoustic guitar and Heafy using a softer more higher range vocally. At first listen you would think this would be a ballad until the drums kick in and it becomes rather progressive structurally. Bynow I am convinced the record has peaked and could get no better.<br /><br />&#34;Through Blood And Dirt And Bone&#34; and &#34;Villainy Thrives&#34; are good songs that are strengthened by the incredible vocal sections and I feel like them working with Draiman has made Heafy shine. Nothing is overdone whatsoever. What I believe will surprise the listeners are the final two songs on this record, &#34;Incineration: The Broken World&#34; and &#34;Wake (The End Is Nigh)&#34; &#34;Incineration&#34; starts off with a lot of tom work from drummer Nick Augusto and the riffs unfold similar to something from latter Nevermore or 90's Annihilator. This song also has a bass solo from Paulo which hasn't been done since 2008's Shogun. There is a very progressive bridge on this one.<br /><br />Wake (The End Is Nigh) in itself gives this record a good rating. It starts of with a dark melodic clean intro with Heafy singing in a low baritone voice. He was definitely channeling Peter Steele with this song. The beauty about this song is there are no repeating parts. Riffs build into new sections and both guitarists bounce off of each other brilliantly. Lyrically this is Trivium's darkest song to date. Overall the album is pretty depressing lyrically. The solos on this one sound like the stuff they did on Ascendancy. Iron Maiden style harmonies and impressive speed.<br /><br />The reason I say this is Trivium's magnum opus is because there is really nothing I would change about this album. I have not a single gripe about it and it's the perfect balance of mainstream music without the band compromising being true to their core sound which I feel like was lacking on &#34;In Waves&#34;. If you have never given Trivium a listen and want to check them out then this is the record worth buying. Everything I have loved about Trivium is here on Vengeance Falls with some new twists.
B000ZNRBK4|4.0|A good quality and easy to use product. Love it.. but definitely I would call it a little overpriced. According to me ten bucks is perfect price for this.
B00FPM4IRO|5.0|Yes this is one of the best games ever created in this game u can fight lots of enemy hordes, find treasure chests, enhance your hear and defeat strong bosses.<br />This game is really good give it a try have fun and give 5 stars reviews for keep updates frecuently
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a great movie that has grown on me.  I enjoyed it when I first saw it (much like Elf).  The second time I watched it, I thought it was wonderful (just like Elf).  I had to own a copy for my family.  I know we will enjoy it over and over and over.....
B0091REZMW|4.0|Not a fan on hidden item games but this is ok May keep it for a a week or 2
B000MD7OKY|5.0|No matter if you haven't seen it in awhile and you know the plot, it's always good to see it once more. I can never get tired of seeing To Catch A Thief.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The fact that I had to endure the excruciatingly long and detailed descriptions of American football (or whatever they name it) games is kinda a hold back in finishing the book simply because I dislike the sport. I almost couldn't stand reading this book because of it. But I kept telling myself that I HAD to finish the book before I watch the movie, because of you know the Oscars and all, so I did. Despite making American football as the big deal in the story, this book has a few chapters about dancing and I must admit that I got a bit teary when I reached the climax of the dancing routines. However I like the narration. Pat is more lovable than Tiffany. If you like drama with football in it, you might wanna read this. If football is not your thing, pick another book that has been adapted into an Oscar-nominated movie. :)
B001XVP9CY|5.0|I love this movie more now than I did when it was new--I think its message and its questions are even more challenging today than in 1977:  What does it mean to be human?  How can one be most human?  What elements of Artificial  Intelligence are truly artificial, and what elements can be attributed to experience?  Perhaps most profoundly:  How does power and authority define our understanding of these concepts.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell has become somewhat famous for his ability to puncture popular preconceptions, and this fifth volume continues that tradition. This one focuses on the ways in which presumed underdogs seem to come out on top so often, whether it's the Viet Cong fending off both the French and the Americans for twenty years, or the impoverished Catholics of Belfast holding their own against the might of the British Army, or the civilian citizens of London not only declining to succumb to panic and terror during the Blitz but actually showing a boost in morale. And it's mostly because of misunderstandings about how power and advantage work.<br /><br />The title, of course, comes from the Bible story about the shepherd boy with the sling and the heavily armed Philistine warrior. I did a degree in ancient history many years ago, one course of which was an introduction to classical methods of warfare, and our professor explained to us then what Gladwell points out here -- that slingers (think of them as artillery) were well known in the ancient world to be superior to infantry, just as infantry could usually defeat cavalry. The Romans certainly knew this, but generations of Sunday School teachers obviously don't. David wasn't overcoming Goliath's strength -- he was avoiding coming into contact with it. The Philistine never had a chance.<br /><br />How did the leaders of the civil rights movement in the `60s finally defeat Bull Connor and those like him? How did Br'er Rabbit beat wily Mr. Fox -- especially when, in this case, he had police dogs? By changing the rules of engagement, that's how. If a small class in school is better than a too-large class, is a *really* small class even better? If being wealthy is better than being poor, is being *really* wealthy even better than that? The answer to both is \\"No,\\" and that's because of the \\"inverted U curve.\\" How did a basketball team of nerdy 12-year-old girls in Silicon Valley defeat almost an entire league of avid and talented players? By substituting attitude and aggressive full-press tactics for the dribbling and shooting talents they lacked.<br /><br />How did the Impressionists overcome the critical resistance of the French art world? By becoming Big Fish in a Small Pond instead of Small Fish in a Big Pond. How can it be that so many multimillionaire entrepreneurs are dyslexic? Because they learn to substitute other skills for the inability to read fluently. Can a disadvantage have a positive influence? Not everyone survives overwhelming odds -- but those who do tend not to have real problems with anything else.<br /><br />Gladwell has a very fluid style and his stuff is always a pleasure to read, but in addition he has the ability to call to your attention things that may seem obvious once they've been pointed out to you. Note that none of the insights he makes available here are original with him. But he holds them up and says, \\"Look at this. Why does this happen? How did they manage this? Well, here's what the answer seems to be. . . .\\" His approach is not academic at all -- and he has been criticized for this by people who don't understand who his audience is meant to be. In any case, he'll hold your attention until you run out of book and he'll entertain you while you learn.yers?

Well, here's what the answer seems to be. . . .\\" His approach is not academic at all -- and he has been criticized for this by people who don't understand who his audience is meant to be. In any case, he'll hold your attention until you run out of book and he'll entertain you while you learn.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|Quite simply the greatest rock album ever made.  EVER!  PERIOD.. Nothing more needs to be said.  This album will be played 100 years from now and still admired.
1936608898|5.0|So well-written, interesting, informative, and helpful.  They make science and health fun and easy to understand.  It has become my &#34;bible.&#34;
B008EL25LE|2.0|I have a T-Mobile LG Optimus L9 and this game plays for a little while then crashes me back to the main phone desktop.  The task is still running and I can switch back to it and continue my game for a little while, then it does it again.  After the 4th time I uninstalled the App.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I remember when this came out and I thought I should watch it but the name was stupid and there was so many other shows I watched at the time this couldn't fit into the schedule. I'm sure if DVR was out then this show would've made it a few more seasons. It's well written and entertaining. Too bad TV execs don't watch their own shows, might've changed their minds long term.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Challenging levels and colorful game boards make this game fun.  Strategy and big explosions from candy combos make it addictive.  My only gripe is that tools or helps cost cash.  I&acute;d like it even more if I could just earn them.
072325804X|5.0|Beautiful book, bought as a first birthday gift for my nephew to start his hopefully, lifelong love of reading!  my daughter and her sons all loved the Beatrix Potter books, and they have kept their collection for future use.
B00ESF2772|5.0|I love that I can have this now anywhere, kindle, iphone, computer. It is my favorite book to read to all of the kids in my life.  If you love Green Eggs and Ham - this will be a sure fire hit - if your tongue doesn't go numb of course!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ITS ABOUT TIME THEY GOT THIS ON HERE. I WENT TO THE APP STORE AND SAW IT THERE AND SAID PLEASE DON'T LET THIS BE FAKE LOL.  Love this game. Don't have to play it on my phone no more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its Fun And Awesome You Should Play It Is Very Fun to Play And Sometimes Addicting You Should Play It
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Story is not that good but Imam giving it 5 star due to the special effects and good actors..
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! This I one of my favorite Disney Princess movies, next to Little Mermaid of course, I haven't seen it in years and I couldn't be happier now that I own it. I've watched it at least 20 times so far.
1250038820|5.0|Just got the book today. I found his blog about a month ago just by chance, and I immediately fell in love with it. I've never been to New York, but I think his photos, especially the ones with stories, are fantastic. Something about the photography feels intimate without feeling intrusive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I am so glad that I can play it on my kindle now this game rocks
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I really enjoy reading mystery novels that can  keep my interest. This was very good reading. I would recommend to others.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|This game does not let me to get out, and I have to reset the my S4 to get free from this.<br />Further more, you can tail your phone invoice without even know what you are doing.<br /><br />I uninstalled on the next day, just used twice.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|A lot of action not much of a script amazing how much punishment these actors supposedly took and still no injuries
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wonderful ride into what happens AFTER the horror of The Shining... Could not put this one down. Stephen King is back to his deep thinking novels... A must for all King fans!!
B00AO3K01C|5.0|the pacific ocean divides these two very different countries and this book brings them together in their differences and connections; real and mysterious, contrasts and links.  Authentic voices of a troubled, young Japanese teenager and a middle-aged writer on an island near Vancouver who finds and investigates her story.  The story develops well,  hangs together and comes together to my satisfaction.  One or two characters lack definition and space (particularly Nau's mother)  but many are well and finely drawn.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I thought it was informative and interesting and shed some very bright light on the birth of &#34;Christianity.&#34;  I would buy it again and again if I had to
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have always enjoyed Stephen king's books and this one is no exception. Loved it!  Would recommend it but you should make sure to read the shining to get the references.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Grandson really showed us up on this game ,He is 7 the graphics are wonderful ,entertains him for hours of fun.
B003G4W49C|1.0|So many positive reviews, prizes and whatnot, and yet so disappointing. Ridiculous plot, and so poorly written that I gave up on it halfway through book I.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Fun to try. I highly recommend this to anyone willing to keep and open mind and try these experiments.  Great read!!!!
B00000K0E5|4.0|This one of the best Bond movie out there, but i expected more from the visual quality. I does not look well as other movies.<br /><br />The sound is incredible.
B00FEN000S|5.0|This movie rocked it.  Totally implausible, but terrific fun. This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to make more of IMHO.
B008JFUR10|5.0|The visuals are superb (my product is blu-ray version), clear, crispy and sharp. The &#34;robots&#34; looks amazing (my tv is a Sony Bravia LCD 32&#34; KDL32).<br /><br />About the sound,<br /><br />I'm glad this product comes with 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound for older home theater systems like mine, 5.1 analog. The sub woofer sounds incredible, but where it really shine (IMHO) is at the first Kaiju roars at the Golden Gate.<br /><br />The blu-ray disc comes with extras and another disc that says &#34;Features&#34; but i have not seen it so i cannot comment on it.<br /><br />I took me by surprise the 3D lenticular cover, i was a good extra.<br /><br />Now the bad part,<br />I don't know if all the packages released was the same, but it comes with 3 disc at stated, the problem? mine one of the disc came  above another and sadly it was the blu-ray disc, lucky it was not scratched, but that arrangement is horrible.
B006WMILQU|1.0|This movie resembles Mansfield Park in name only.  If you enjoyed the book, probably the best of Austen's novels, you are not likely to enjoy this film. The characters are so altered from the novel they are unrecognizable and their motives so inscrutable you can't really care! The subtle humor is entirely missing. Two examples of the bizarre story/character changes: Our Miss Fanny Price would never have accepted Henry's proposal, or worse yet, change her mind the next day! Her highly principled, if overly stern, uncle Sir Thomas Bertram is portrayed as a lecherous man who brutalizes and rapes his slaves in Antigua? Very disappointing, because the cast is  good, even if all the young people seem just a little older than they ought to be.  I was fully prepared to enjoy it, expecting it to be better than the previous movie version which I was also disappointed with, however I now see that the older movie is the superior one, if only because it doesn't absolutely butcher the story and characters.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|The movie was excellent. It may not be that of a gory movie, but it have great suspense and visuals. The unrated version is a good add, but if you think the alternate ending is here..no, i repeat NO, so if your purchase is just based on it then pick up the regular version.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just challenging enough to keep my interest but not so hard I get frustrated. I really enjoyed it, wish there was more.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you are fan of the book The Shining you should be more than satisfied with this follow up. Danny Torrance is all grown up and for my money, his character development did not disappoint. As a loyal King fan, I did not know what direction King would take and was a little worried Danny would not be recognizable. I liked him and thought King did a great job and didn't turn Danny into someone who didn't jive with the first book.<br /><br />I really don't want to say too much about the story itself because I don't want to give anything away. It's a good story with an excellent new character, Abra. The story is typical King good vs bad, and I was hooked from page one. There is nice surprise in the final confrontation that I thought was perfect and brought the first story back around in a satisfying way.<br /><br />The only negative I see in this book, is now I want another one and I probably won't get it.
B0009P5YXO|1.0|I chose this rating because I thought this product was going to be more durable then previous reviews suggested. I just got it in the mail and I might pay $5 for this product. It is flimsy, cheap and the button doesn't always work.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have read all of Gregory's books.  If you like historical fiction, she is your woman!  Gregory draws you into the time period and makes you want to to outside sources to learn more.  Love her books!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My son is a big fan of Doctor Who, and he loves his Sonic Screwdriver.  For me, the sound is very realistic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best drama in recent 30 years I've ever seen included US, Europe and Asia!<br /> This drama is great because actors and actresses are real actors.<br />It's not like recent silly drama using just popular actors at the moment.
B00F2362IE|3.0|My son was incredibly excited to play this game. He saw a commercial on Nickelodeon for it showing how you could &#34;play all the Turtles!&#34; This is true, but MISLEADING. In order to do so you will need to buy the app and either spend an inordinate amount of time playing it with the ONE character they let you use, or spend an inordinate amount of money buying all the characters. Luckily my son has fun with the game and that's what matters to me. Basically the game moves for you and you have to jump gaps/obstacles in/on rooftops and fight footsoldiers (bad guys). It's easy enough for my five year old to comprehend, play and enjoy.
B000GDMFWM|4.0|I purchased this used. It is in mint condition and is a Japanese vinyl pressing. The album is one of the greats as it has a few songs that are my favorite songs. The two best known songs from this album are &#34;Fat Bottom Girls&#34; and &#34;Bicycle Race&#34;. This also has the original nude bicycle poster with a lot of naked girls riding bikes. There are other hidden gems on this album as I usually buy an album and play it in its entirety.<br /><br />I purchased this because I collect Japanese vinyl pressings as they are some of the best sounding albums from this era. Most where pressed on virgin vinyl where as other countries , mostly the US, where using the scraps and recycled vinyl during this era. My only complaint about this album, and this is my fault for not inquiring, is that it is missing the OBI sash. That may sound picky to most, but as a collector, I like having the OBI intact on my Japan pressings.<br /><br />Overall a great album from a great band.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|but it does get more challenging at the higher levels.  I think young kids might enjoy this -- going to see what my grandson thinks!
B0063S3DMK|5.0|So different and insightful. Opened my eyes to problems other cultural groups face in surviving and in being able to keep their identity.
B005K15XR4|5.0|My son and I love this CD.  The more you listen to it the more you realize just how many television commercials, and movies, use the tracks on this CD for their background / mood music.  I am also impressed with the raw awesome power that some of the music conveys to you...it makes you feel awestruck but empowered at the same time.  Good workout music too!!
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie was enjoyable to watch.  It is tough to get the whole story crammed in a couple of hours, but the highlights were covered well.  As is typical, read the book to get the most out of this story.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 6yr old daughter loves this game. Plays it every chance she gets. She is amazed by the details and the challenge. She also likes the fact that you can add other characters to the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a awesome game to play I love it you get characters, surf boards, and prizes it's a lot of fun I hope you have fun.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Honestly this film wasn't perfect.  The main actor left something to be desired, a little odd in the way he delivered lines, but everyone else was great.  Some generic plot points, and characters.  Some plot points just don't really make sence or are not well explained (the mind melding thing, had to be related at first, but then not...  not explained well)  Knowing all this I was still amazed and pleased with this movie.  There were about three moments were my jaw hit the floor in nerdy enthusiasm for the cool effects presented on screen.  The battles were cool, special effects were the best I've ever seen (non noticable).  The ending did leave a little to be desired, though the second to last battle was excellent.  Again just a fun monster flick.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am a single 27yr old mother. My 3yr old son introduced this game to me &now I play all the time. Its fun,  challenging &has pretty great graphics. Vibrant, I love it!
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I love this movie!! It cute and funny!! I watch it at least once a year around Halloween if not more often!
1933492953|5.0|Wow! Amazing art work! I absolutely LOVE this book and all it has to offer on set up a graphic novel. It's very detailed and the author shows exactly what he means and has a lot of art work and framed artwork that clear explains how to set up your scenes!
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I first met Diana Krall while flying home to Melbourne, Australia  from Sydney; the in flight entertainment was Diana Krall Live in Paris. Although I have all of her albums and videos,<br />I still think this was the best concert she ever did.<br />Please Diana, get back to what you do so well!<br />I bought the Glad Rag Doll out of loyalty, more than because I liked it. Technically it is good, as you would expect from a brilliant jazz pianist and singer. I am assuming she did it for her father, as I know she is close to him. \\"Diana Krall Live In Rio\\" was the last good thing she did in my humble opinion. Where is her trio, Anthony Wilson, John Clayton, Jeff Hamilton, and many other brilliant musicians that she has used in the past?
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Watched it with two of my grandchildren (ages 5 and 7) who absolutely loved it.  It is a fun movie for all ages.
039916409X|5.0|I love this book and I love Margaret Lynch........its great to see so many books making it to the NY Times Best Seller list bringing this amazing tool of tapping to the world.<br />I have used Tapping for many things and have been utterly amazed at how just 'feeeeeling' better attracts new and wonderful things so quickly.....after all, nothing is more important than the way you FEEL.<br />Get this book, give it a try, even if you don't BELIEVE, just try and see what happens. You will be amazed !
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game, but can be a little annoying to wait for energy as well as the slow Crystal earnings. But still, 3/5
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVE! the whole trilogy is great. it keeps you on your seat and the love story is something else!! I wish it didn't have to end. Hoping EL James comes out with some more of this story! :)
B0035XVVDY|5.0|This is a very good action movie that is all about our messed up legal system, but he does go over the top at the end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVE! the whole trilogy is great. it keeps you on your seat and the love story is something else!! I wish it didn't have to end. Hoping EL James comes out with some more of this story! :)
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|It was a good continuation of the Shining and it has left it open for a sequel. Stephen is back in form.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE! the whole trilogy is great. it keeps you on your seat and the love story is something else!! I wish it didn't have to end. Hoping EL James comes out with some more of this story! :)
B00F35BV64|4.0|Not sure what the title refers to, but the movie is solid and well done. Character and storyline development are smooth and leaves us waiting for the next installment.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|This game was kind of boring but the art work was wonderful. I think this game was priced very fairly, all in all I'm happy with my purchase.
B000VZX8J4|5.0|I love this album ! Great mix of heavy, blues and guitar ! Chris Cornell is a natural ! He reminds me of an earlier version of Gregg Allman. I love Slaves and Bulldozers
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great sequel but it stands alone too (if you haven't read The Shining).  I'm a &#34;constant reader&#34; of Stephen King and I don't know how he thinks up new monsters!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|The best crime story I have read in a while. Kudos to the author for the fantastic narration. I liked the way the story goes on without any lags.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|Nothing like the original movie, so if you're a die-hard Arnold fan you may not like it. All in all, it stands well on its own with plenty of action and decent swordplay.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased to see our road warriors back.  The scenes are so real, and emotions so raw.  No one is safe, everyone is hanging in the balance....and the viewer is brought to the very brink over and over again.
B00E0SX118|5.0|My kids love this movie!  The animation in it is great and the artists had great imagination for all of the prehistoric animals!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love this series but the end of season 3 was awful! BUT I can't wait to see what happens next.<br />The quality of acting and costuming is extraordinary.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Pretty good movie I thought ut wasnt gonna be good at first, but I was wrong you should watch it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love to play this game, it makes you think hard but is relaxing at the same time! Hope they never stop coming up with new levels.
B005DJREJS|1.0|just didn't work for me. i just don't think I'm in the demographic for this show.  there's a large part of society that will enjoy this--not me.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Boring, just very boring. Matthew McConauhey also manages to put a shirtless scene in this movie as well, something for the ladies.
B009JNXK88|4.0|I really enjoyed the gameplay. A bit hard on touchscreen but otherwise tight controls, with great level design and enemy placement. Sometimes the game would get repetitive and would take long to load the window to start the next stage or quit when finishing a level. The graphics and music are a lot of fun.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like how in the beginning of the game it like OMG I can NEVER be as good a hi/her. But in the end u realize improve. It's great for all ages and its so relaxing. Plus the dragons r soooo cute!
0142418471|4.0|I really liked this book, especially the John Green portion!<br /><br />1. Characters quirky and cute<br />2. Believable chain of events<br />3. Gay teens handled tastefully<br />4. Dual points of view both interesting<br />5. Ending so magnificently awesome!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the first Stephen King book I have ever read.  I was awed at his outstanding narrative writing!  I couldn't put this book down.  It was incredible!<br />Janet Lorek
0062014536|1.0|Delirium was awesome!<br />Pandemonium was okay<br />Requiem sucks<br /><br />Lauren Oliver totally changes Alex and Lena. They are not the same people who feel in love and you feel in love with. They barely interact and Lena never explains why she cheated on him.<br /><br />Also Lena didn't really speak to Hanna when they met! I was waiting for some epic moment that never happened.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I picked this up to have an app to do with my 5 year old, and it turns out I'm hooked too!  Great app!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just like my phone app, so I already got the hang of it! Only have access where wireless is available, but I knew that before I downloaded it.
B005NNML6K|5.0|This one was a game changer for them and for American radio music trends. On \\"Some Girls\\", they showed that disco and rock and country and blues were sired by the same father and raised by the same mother, then abandoned to live on their own in a decrepit apartment in NYC. With all your friends.
B0000DZTIL|4.0|Ok...some of you may disagree about the terrible part. But I would consider this one a must have for those collecting (bad) 80's movies. But hey, I really like it.
B00C061HZY|4.0|Yes, it's good ... some of it's even great (the Giorgio Moroder track is genius!) Best RAM so far, IMHO.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Once again, the Satch man cometh and cranks out some awesomeness. A definite must! Shipping was great. Not a scratch on the cover. Highly recommended.
0060581808|5.0|These classics from Laura Ingalls Wilder should be required reading for all little (and big!) boys and girls... They give us the feel of our forebears, of how it was to live in those days when we were just discovering this amazing land of ours, and when people valued the small things, appreciated what they had, revered each other, and had time to have courage and character and to appreciate nature and this world we live in.  How easy we have it today!  And these stories help us appreciate that...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Besides the ending being a little corny, I was thoroughly engaged following grown up Dan Torrence.  King's antagonists in the book were superb and something only he could have dreamt up.  Sequels can be misfires many, many times, but King paid homage to his  original classicand his other classics with this one in many splendid ways.  It was a nail biter when I got involved with these characters and their interaction, couldn't put the &#34;Kindle&#34; down.  Can't wait for the movie.  Cast Rose McGowan as Rose the Hat.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|so much fun playing this game with my little girl. would recommend this game to anyone who loves the minions.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I have seen.  I truly felt the fear of the unknown.  Happily, it lacked any gruesome scenes and just gave you a great scare!  Blood and gore are good for shock-value, but it's not scary.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's anatomy is my favorite show. When I first watched the show I became a grey's anatomy fan I never miss it. I already have Seasons One Two Three Four Five Six and soon  the rest of them l love this Show♡♥♡♥♡
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow!! The book is great!!! I have read this book for times and I still can't get enough of it!! Great job Suzanne Collins!!!
B0018M6J90|5.0|One of those movies you'll watch again and again.  Broad mix of actors with definite talent.  Would love to see a sequel.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|The artwork isn't very good. Hard to see what the active tiles are. No fun. Not worth the effort. Took it off my device.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King is Truly my favourite author. He writes prose and dialogue that's realistic and sounds like your having a conversation with your best friend, even when the dialogue gets to be a bit on the \\" fantastic\\" side. He makes me think. Laugh at times,and oh yeah can scare the pants off me. For the record I do read with my pants on. When I heard about Dr.Sleep my eyes bulges out. A sequel to The Shining, I couldn't believe it. But even I wondered how King could pull it off. One of the scariest,breathtakingly, and yes poignant novels oh Kings caterer, how can he top it? The answer is he can't. But that's not a bad thing. There is plenty hear to remind you of The Shining but it's not a direct sequel. This Dan Torrances story. Not the child we met in the first book but the man he's become, and surprise he's a lot like his father. The story begins a few short years after the events at The Overlook. We do get some surprise appearances from some of our favourite Overlook residence. And a couple of wonderful scenes with our favourite old cook and Dan's protector. And if your a Joe Hill fan you'll appreciate the shout out to one of his more memorable characters. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. But this is Dan's story,from his lowest point to his new awakening which leads him on a path of discovery that will take him from his alchohics anonymous meetings to that evil place in Colorado. But first he encounters A bra, a young girl with the shining that's much more potent and powerful than Dan's. For me she's the best character in the book. King can write young characters that are smart, funny,and very identifiable. The relationship between Dan and this young woman is what drives this story. I'm not going to rehash the plot of the story because others have and I'm sure some of the people reading this have already read the book. But I will say \\"don't trust people in RVs!!\\" All in all another great literary treat from the King.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Fun Game. Not so easy to score big but not impossible. Lots of variety to keep you interested and playing for hours.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|The movie is great, and the quality was awesome. I was tred of using netflix and rent this from Amazon. Kind of pricey though.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Not so easy at times. But you can get 5 stars if your fast enough or if you don't care about the stars, don't try so hard and you won't get any. te he he. Of couse, you can redo any puzzle to get a better score. I am surprised this game is actually a free game, I'd pay for it. Love it! Give it a try! I finished all the levels and wil go back and re-try those few pesky little ones.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time for along while I was wondering when this game was coming to Amazon yay I'm so glad now I can play on my kindle
B006M4F67A|1.0|The artwork isn't very good. Hard to see what the active tiles are. No fun. Not worth the effort. Took it off my device.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worth every penny this chromecast is an amazing little device and I just hope that later on its able to do more
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This movie was great, priceless all time movie that everyone should watch! I would totally recommendable for everyone looking for a good movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really good i love it jas dofferent themes and its fun i love the movies thats another reason i like this game. YOU SHOULD REALLY GET IT!!!!!
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|Excellent product for light industrial / hobby applications requiring multiple I/O and DAC ports. Free download of excellent open-source development system.
B006M4F67A|5.0|All electronic Mahjong games are not created equal. I like that this one stops and offers the option to reshuffle when you have no moves, rather than automatically reshuffling for you. Also, if you change your mind, focus goes to the next tile rather than having to deselect a tile (like in Mahjong Titans for PC). Also, the music is calming unlike some that go to great lengths to have cutesy dragon sounds or disturbing gongs.<br /><br />There is one tiny glitch on a tile in Fish ( lower right) that appears to be selectable, but isn't. You can easily select the one next to it and so it interrupts the flow for just a moment. I do hope this is corrected on the next update.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes... at 374 pages, it was just my size! I was not surprised at the ending but enjoyed the journey of Rose's life story... Rose had visions and only a short time to experience her Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes... read on... The Kindle edition is free!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't put it down, and I've recommended it to several of my students (I'm a substitute, but I know lots of the high school students where I teach) and fellow teachers.  The weaving of an historical story with the contemporary experiences of a child who is in the foster care system is delicate and well done.  The characters are well drawn and I cared about each and every one of them.<br /><br />BUY this book.  (or borrow it).  I usually read audio books, but this one (on my Kindle) kept me reading at times when I should have been doing something else.  It is a lovely tribute to the strength of human character.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|After the death of his beloved wife, Martha. (At the hands of humans) daddy Dracula is left to raise their daughter mavis. Dracula is very overprotective of his little \\"mavey wavy\\" and soon builds a hotel to Protect her and the others that come to the hotel.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wow. I'm about halfway through this book, but I can safely say it already is a worthy follow-up to The Shining, which haunted me for years (and it's all coming baaaack). While the movie wasn't as good as the book, the little boy who played Danny was breathtakingly vulnerable, and I wondered about what would lie ahead for him. Now I'm finding out! Ironically, HE is haunted by a heartrendingly beautiful little boy in this story, and, as I continue to read, may be able to affect the future of a little girl....Totally worth reading!
B00DURHYWC|1.0|I love Pink Martini but this is disappointing. I agree with the other reviewer that said it was a Various Artists collection, and as such it doesn't flow well from song to song. I will check out their other cds to buy BUT I will listen to samples first.
B00004XQ8H|4.0|Lisa Della Casa is an example of a musician with a standout voice - it's an instrument of great beauty and range - but without the musical expressivity or depth to match.  While I expected and wanted to like this CD, it's unfortunately an also-ran in the competitive field of Four Last Songs, Richard Strauss' last composition and perhaps his greatest.  Della Casa can sing any note and do so beautifully.  It's hard to overstate her technical perfection as a lyric soprano.  But there's no equivalent shaping of phrases or dynamic range, in terms of purely audible events, and no sense of emotional depth or connection to the music or poetry, something I intuitively sense from her \\"interpretation\\".<br /><br />These strengths and weaknesses are very evident in the 1st Arabella excerpt here (track 5), in which the humor and drama, so apparent in Elizabeth Schwarzkopf's recording from the same time period, is completely absent.  Della Casa doesn't seem to understand the melodic flow and presents everything in a flat fashion.<br /><br />I would actually have given this incredibly overrated disc 3 stars except for two facts:<br /><br />- Karl Bohm, a conductor who normally doesn't interest me, has a very unusual and original approach to the Four Last Songs, one stressing individual lines and interplay between the instruments.  It's worth hearing.  They take \\"Im abendrot\\", the concluding number of the Four Last Songs, unusually rapidly, perhaps showing how I am conditioned to slow tempi by more ponderous recent performances.<br />- I love the engineering on this release, despite its age.  The sound is completely natural and attractive.  The Four Last Songs clearly mike Della Casa separately, which is a flaw I will forgive given the tonal beauty of the recording, perhaps a result of the tubed equipment which must have been used.<br /><br />Note that the order of the Four Last Songs has been rotated, with \\"Schlafengehen\\" and \\"Fruhling\\" switched.<br /><br />Superior alternatives would include the Elisabeth Schwarzkopf version from 1953 and beautiful more recent performances featuring Gundula Janowitz and Jessye Norman.  All of them are different but all are much better than Della Casa's.uld include the Elisabeth Schwarzkopf version from 1953 and beautiful more recent performances featuring Gundula Janowitz and Jessye Norman.

B006RXQ1L6|5.0|This is the way a Broadway musical should be translated to the screen. The director of Les Miserables should have watched this.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful. I couldn't put it down. I loved how the story was told from the perspective of three different women. The angst and emotion was described so perfectly I could feel their pain and their joy. A fabulous story.
0307596885|4.0|I had this book from the library, and decided I should read it. I enjoyed it though I usually do not read many short stories. Alice Munro is very talented. The stories resonate with feeling. Since she won the Nobel, there was some curiosity as to how she expressed herself. I must admit she has a very literary style.<br /><br />I think you will enjoy the book. I highly recommend it.
0761172726|5.0|Trying to keep track of a busy family can be challenging. Both my husband and I work full-time, my husband has gone back to school, we have kids, school events, class projects, sports, birthday parties, family get togethers, etc. It’s a challenge to not only keep everyone’s schedule straight, but also to make sure that everyone is informed of all upcoming events/plans. This calendar is awesome! There is a column for everyone in the family (as long as your family doesn’t consist of more than 5 members), it comes with cute stickers for common events, and even a magnetized 1 page phone list for the fridge. I am a little OCD when it comes to plans (drives my husband crazy, but someone has to keep us all organized) and I couldn’t ask for more from a simple wall calendar.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|This was a short fast read that was combination Howard Stern/Anchorman movie/Hallmark channel movie with some hot sex scenes thrown in.  If looking for frivolous fun sexy read with a couple characters we all have met at work or at a bar, you'll enjoy.  The twist on this fun sexy read is that the main male character essentially narrates from a \\"guy's perspective\\" and it is funny and accurate.For the reviewers who think the lead is horrible, it is just that the author took all the \\"guy's guy\\" attributes, slightly exaggerated them and if every guy walked around around with a bubble over his head, this is really what females would hear. Guys lead with their penis, as we all know from the most educated/respected/highly professional to the factory worker, it doesn't matter(i.e. from Clinton on down line). I know for a fact that any line this character said would put my husband and his executive friends under the table laughing and they would agree-though have the courtesy to check that side of their brain!  If you don't get that, then you really need to get some good male friends to bond with and check the condescending attitude at the door-accept guys as guys and know to pick the ones who know how to control that part of their brain-like this character finally realizes-but still can tell a crude joke but not mean it in a demeaning way-just crude fun.  Yes the story gets a little too much at the end, but all in good fun and no more then the reason so many like Pretty Woman! And for all those horrified at sexual harassment-this nicely is written ignoring the crazy females who will shout this just because a guy is trying to pursue/date a love interest. That is how sexual harassment got so misunderstood-a guy pursuing you or telling an off color joke is not harassment, lighten up! There is no undertone the girl is having her job threatened, male lead is not her boss but co-employee, no tale he will report her to his father to get fired-they are equals and he happens to be aggressive, sarcastic determined and fun.  You should hope to be pursued by that guy! He also likes children and doesn't lead on girls-I like this fun guy who knows he's great but nice to others!!  And girls should not play dumb who meet up with this type of character that he is the bad guy-girls should be smart enough to not offer it up so easy then! lol  Overall a 3 star book, plus an added star because if your in the mood for a funny frivolous sex read I would recommend!  By no means a Great Book Club read but you shouldn't be buying this type of read for that
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I can't fully settle on my favourite aspect, the depth of the characters, the detail that lends subjective realism, the gripping and unpredictable drama. Very thought provoking example of fear producing control freaks producing fear. A good read that reminds us of the best and worst of human nature.

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Rovio Stars IS a &quot;division of Rovio&quot;.  it is an offshoot production division for games that rovio thinks have what it takes to be part of the rovio tradition.  Also, the &quot;thief&quot; word in the name seems something we need not be so worried about.<br /><br />The game is adorable, functional, challenging and fun, yet easy to learn.  I have grandchildren who will love this as much as I do.  It has been fashioned to work the same way angry birds works, yet the game is different enough to be a &quot;new thing&quot;!<br /><br />This game works fine on my Samsung galaxy note two(i317 not rooted, ver 4.1.2)<br /><br />I want to address the reviewer who had the problem with the word &quot;thief&quot; in the title.<br /><br />Their is no doubt about it that the main character is a thief.  So was Robin Hood.  So what.<br /><br />This game does not teach one how to be a thief, it teaches thinking skills and dexterity.<br /><br />Should we take &quot;thief&quot; out of the dictionary?  Burn some books? Have a witch hunt?  Really.  How about the movie &quot;Aladin&quot;?  I allowed my children to watch THAT movie repeatedly.  They are all successful honest adults (two phi beta kappa and one on the way) for which I am very proud.<br /><br />Thank You Rovio And Rovio Stars for another hit game!

B0088X7YMS|4.0|The continuation of this series of movies was the best of the sequals  of Starship Troopers. I hope that any further sequals will be of this quality.
B0068857QA|5.0|When I first saw the skittles in the Humvee in the beginning of the first episode I knew that they had taken great pains to strive for accuracy down to even the very minute details like the ever presence of Charms and Skittles in Humvee's.  It's made by the same people that did The Wire, so it should be no surprise.<br /><br />They manage to make a documentary account by a journalist into a very entertaining mini-series that will certainly satisfy anyone looking for an action show but the semi-fictional nature of the show allows adds greatly to the journalistic account by adding a certain life to the story that is missing in factual documentaries and books.<br /><br />The ONLY disappointment from this show is in how short it was.  After seeing how well they did a war-series I wish they would do a full show like this.  This does an excellent job of breaking the hard emotion and tension and boredom with gallows humor.  It's not as shockingly violent as some war movies and shows are, I watched it with my mother and she liked it a lot, other than having concerns about the effect of war on the soldiers but that's mothers for you.<br /><br />It isn't horribly politicized, it was taken from a very straightforward account of the journalists time with Recon and his interest was in youth subcultures so it's more focused on the people than making a statement.  That said, there are clearly overtures about the successes and failures of the command and mission but it's incidental rather than the focus of the show. Most of which is kept narrowly and personally to the experience of the soldiers and their immediate superiors.  But, those looking for or interested in the politics of the Iraq war will not be disappointed either.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this show enough. I've watched and liked shows/movies like the Unit, Zero Dark Thirty, and documentaries like Restrepo (also the best Documentary btw.) It's closer to the documentaries than the shows and movies which, while all fine pieces of work for what they are, sacrifice accuracy for over-the-top drama but manages to be much more entertaining.  This is very much like The Wire, but the format is carried overly very aptly to the Iraq War.

B0062P3392|4.0|The movie cast was impressive. It included  Jason Statham, Clive Owen, and Robert De Niro. The acting was engaging.<br /><br />The action scenes were gripping, suspenseful, quick and deadly.<br /><br />However, there are many logical holes that are too huge to be ignored. For example, in one scene, the hired killer was able to kill an SAS soldier right at SAS headquarter in Herefored, UK and got away with it.  That's right. It's so far fetched that it became a bad joke.<br /><br />In short, it's worth watching once for the action and suspense.

I'm a teenage guy and I think that opera is super cool and I wouldn't want to see any other prod of Der Ring. Robert Lepage is such a visionary and I think he's so brave for persevering, even when the Machine was a challenge. This recording is stunning, with amazing graphics- almost like watching a movie, but still with the feeling of a good, old stage production. Maybe not a must-buy, but definitely a must-see!!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil Gaiman has crafter one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read. The tale will truly stand any test time may hand it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I confess I rarely consider the &#34;extras&#34; in a movie review unless they are essential to understanding the film, or they are a major addition to the cost (such as with 5 disk LOTR sets or 3 disk Avatar sets). On this single DVD, the value stands and falls on the value of the film. I have never been a rabid fan of Star Trek, especially the movies, since I believe they are relatively weak when compared to their closest competitors, the Star Wars series. But this film may be the very best effort so far to attain a level comparable to Star Wars (lets say Star Wars II, Attack of the Clones). I think one of the very best reasons for that is in the quality of the competition, the fabulously talented Khan Noonien Singh, who first appears in the original Star Trek series in 1967, and again in the second Star Trek movie, The Wrath of Khan. The moral here may be &#34;never let a good villain go to waste.&#34; Khan's virtue is probably based on both the screenwriters script for his dialogue plus the delightfully sinister characterization by my favorite actor, Benedict Cumberbatch (who is having a very good year in film). Cumberbatch plays it very, very cool. Khan is an unknown quantity to the young Kirk and Spock, which is why Spock somehow, consults an older version of himself<br /><br />It annoyed me that the technique by which he did that is not explained. But that is one of the difficulties of fast action movies. There is no time to fit in the glue that fits things together. (Even the greatest sci fi flicks have that problem, such as 2001 and Avatar.) The advantage you have over the characters in the story is that you know all about Khan long before Kirk and Spock do.<br /><br />And, like so many action / sci fi movies, there are many deus ex machina rescues which pull the bacon out of the fire just in time, and there are an equal number of whatever the opposite is of deus ex machina. That is, dangers, especially late in the film, for which no groundwork has been laid. It's as if the writer says, &#34;These guys are getting off too easily. We need to throw another monkey wrench into the works.&#34; Too much of that and we have just action for the sake of action.<br /><br />But, I confess, this film carries it off with a great amount of &eacute;lan. We feel sympathetic for at least a few of the characters, such as Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Sulu, and Admiral Pike. And, Cumberbatch pulls off a really believable cold, but remarkably calculating character who can appear to be sympathetic and on you side when it suits his purpose.d.

B009LDD4V4|4.0|In this season, Booth and Bones have settled in to their new relationship, living together, still unmarried, but in love. Join with that a new twist in the Sweets / Daisy relationship (trying to avoid spoilers) a new relationship for Cam, and new emphasis on Hodgins and Angela, with their daughter. All of this would seem to make a better rounded story setting. I always thought one of the great virtues of the series \\"Numb3rs\\" was that it had three centers of gravity, the FBI office, the University, and the Eppes home. That solution to the \\"Three Body Problem\\" was set in place from the start. With Bones, it is not as effective, except that it has renewed the Brennan / Booth / Sweets dynamic which was fresh when Sweets was added to the show. In fact, in general, Sweets character is the one which has grown the most. The most exciting non-forensic arc in the story is Cam's new relation.<br /><br />The opening episode, which resolved the cliff hanger from Season Seven was done very nicely. \\"Bones\\" often has very good transitions from season to season. But after resolving the Christopher Pelant arc at the end of the first episode, the story line is left dangling, except by a puzzling piece of action involving Reed Diamond, the FBI agent who takes over the Pelant case from Booth. Most of the episodes from 2 through 21 seem relatively routine, with few case based connections between episodes.<br /><br />Like Ian Edgerton's appearances on Numb3rs, the story is always enlivened when certain guest actors appear, such as Cindi Lauper, and especially Patricia Belcher, as Miss Caroline Julian, the Federal prosecutor, who more often than not is the one who gets our heroes out of a jam. On piece of business, Bones naivet&eacute; about many commonsensical things, which the average person takes for granted, is wearing thin, like Ziva David's constantly misspeaking American idioms on NCIS. One would expect a person of her intelligence would be smart enough to dumb down her small talk. But she doesn't, irritating Booth, especially regarding religion.<br /><br />I have never been especially fond of the Bones recurring villains. They don't seem entirely human. They are held at arm's length, not like the pair, Buck Winters and Crystal Hoyle in a two part arc in Numb3rs (first and second episodes in the 3rd season.) Booth continues to be the best all around character, with Camille Saroyan a close second. I would rate this season just a bit less interesting than the second season, and seasons 5 - 7. We need more flesh put on our arch-villain's bones!e doesn't, irritating Booth, especially regarding religion.<br /><br />I have never been especially fond of the Bones recurring villains.

King fills the reader in concisely on the life of Danny Torrance since &#34;The Shining&#34;, creating a brand new story without simply re-working the prior one.  I read it in two days!  It is also a spiritually uplifting story that I have been recommending to my yoga students, friends, and family.

B00B1D7ANK|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for our 5 year old grandson's  Christmas 2013.  After looking at the toy in the box I'm very pleased with it.  The detail is superb.  I had only the pictures, discription and other reviews to go by from Amazon.com.  So very happy it came in a box with an extra cardboard sleeve for protection.  This will make for easy wrapping.  Any other Schleich toys I've seen in stores don't have any packaging available.  I've never seen the dragons and griffins anywhere else in person.  I will be looking for more figures from this site in the future.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|It keeps you alert and makes a good reading. However, while reading, it seemed to me it was written with 2 main aims: 1) trying to make up for the Da Vinci Code assertions regarding the Church and 2) advertising the Masons. I am not saying any of the aims are bad, but one may wonder about the intentions of the author. Still a very good story and well written, even in the passages when too much technical detail is given for no particular reason. :)

B00ELD19OI|4.0|After legendary releases with Aquarius and Visions I was expecting something equally as legendary from Haken.  And while this album is quite amazing, I'm giving it 4 stars because it isn't at the same level as their previous two albums.  Maybe it's not fair to compare an album to past releases, especially when the two previous releases were in my mind two of the top 10 albums ever made.  But there are a few reasons I give this album a 4.25/5 instead of 4.5 or up.<br /><br />The down part of this album for me was that they seem to have veered away from the heavy guitar-dominated songs of the previous albums.  Not that I don't like the keyboard, but I was left wanting more from the 8-string and 7-string guitars they play.  The other thing I noticed was that this album is a bit more progressive than I am accustomed to.  On first listen I was pretty disappointed.  It has since grown on me and I listen to it all the time.  But I can take songs from Aquarius and Visions and play them for my non-musically minded friends and say &#34;see isn't this song bad ass.&#34;  I don't think I could get away with that with anything from the Mountain.  Maybe In Memoriam, which is pretty catchy.  But a song like Cockroach King, while I like it now, is a bit too prog in my humble opinion.<br /><br />The high point of the album is Falling Back to Earth, which you'll really get into after a few listens.  For any fan of prog rock this album is a must have.  But don't be expecting another Visions.  Maybe the bar was set too high after that release.  Happy progging.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Great game! I would've rated it 5 stars but made my kindle freeze up. It went black and I couldn't use it I had to shut my kindle of then delete the game! All in all its a great game but needs to be fixed. Thanks!!!!
B00EOO55GW|4.0|I think this is a great album and I love all the songs.  The reason I give it four stars is because instrumentally it's not what I've come to expect from Avenged Sevenfold.  By that I'm talking mainly about the percussion.  Maybe we got spoiled with The Rev and Mike Portnoy filling in on the last album, but the drumming on this album just seems to lack that A7X punch.  It's simple and lacks creativity.  Especially on the title track, where someone with moderate drum skills could fill in and play on stage.  I know the new drummer can play some pretty intense stuff, since he plays Portnoy's stuff from Nightmare live.  So I wonder why the drumming is so simple and bland on this album.  If anyone knows feel free to fill me in.  Maybe they're going for a more radio friendly sound?<br /><br />Synister Gates is awesome as always, but I think he toned down his solos just a bit.  Which is fine, maybe now I can actually play them without endless hours of practice, but I've come to expect to be stumped by his work.<br /><br />That being said, I still love the songs.  The highlight for me is Crimson Day, a more ballad type song.  Coming Home is also pretty awesome.  The low point is the title track.  But it's easy to get into all the songs.  This album is not in the league of Nightmare and their self titled album, but it's still pretty awesome.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Interesting book. Good characters.  Loved the plot line.  Not wild about the ending, but completely understand it.  Good leisure read.
0385743564|4.0|I picked this book up for myself, but once I finished it, but son picked it up. He isn't much of a reader, but the cover caught his eye and now he won't put it down. I still need to finish the last two chapters, but wanted to share how this story draws you in right in the first couple of chapters. You find it hard to put down as the setting and character development just flow perfectly and don't lend to a place where you feel you can put the book down. I found myself vividly seeing the scenes as I read. The author voice is natural and the pacing is right on. Action is fast, but then you have time to reflect and slow down to take in the details that follow. Well done and I'm sure I'll be happy with the ending once I get it back from my son.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook's Android app is one of the buggiest, feature-missing, steaming piles of fail to have ever been foisted on the public. As a software developer, this app completely horrifies me. It's like they just didn't try. Launching the app is just the first step into a user experience that is both disappointing and frustrating. Once you have selected whether or not to sync your contacts (and you WILL be asked to make this choice every single time you start the app), you get to see your news feed. Or at least it kind of looks like your news feed, if your news feed were put together by trained monkeys who sort of had a grasp of the English language and layout concepts.<br /><br />As with everything else Facebook, kiss your privacy goodbye as the app uses your device's GPS (or wi-fi triangulation if available) to let everyone know where you are. On vacation and looking for a quick way to let potential burglars know that your house is unguarded? Look no further than this app.<br /><br />And enjoy exiting the app - on a very fast device, the program averages three to four MINUTES to close. Literally the slowest-closing program I have ever seen. There's no excuse for it, and as you sit there, looking at the Facebook logo and the message that it is logging out, you will begin to wonder when your life lost its intrinsic value.
039916409X|5.0|This book brings together the tools that anyone can use to change their minds set and in so doing change their life.<br />Margaret Lynch is some one I have been following for about 5 years now and all I would say to you is \\"buy the book\\"\\" do the work and your world will be changed
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I held off on reading this series for a long time.  I actually started it some time ago then stopped and then decided to resume it closer to the movie's release.  Ultimately I ended up watching the movie before finishing the book. There were times that the book read like fanfiction to me (and then I learned that's because it actually was), but I've certainly read worse.  While I thought the movie was pretty rushed, the book had the opposite effect for me and felt overly long, but that could be because I didn't find the melodrama particularly interesting between the main three, especially Simon's assured-to-be-unrequited feelings for Clary.<br /><br />Jace.  Jace. Jace.  Well at least he has a personality?  He comes off as pretty juvenile for me at times and I didn't always find it funny, so for me he wasn't as swoon-worthy as I'm sure he is for millions of others.  The chemistry with Clary is pretty good until the twist that made my eyes roll.  After that I was pretty sure I wouldn't be interested in seeing it play out for multiple books throughout the series.<br /><br />I enjoyed the magic, mythology and lore here, but it honestly wasn't something that I can't get anywhere else and better, so while I don't think I'll completely drop the series, I'm also in no rush to continue it anytime soon.  I'm much more likely to read the The Infernal Devices Trilogy instead because there are only 3 of those and they're complete.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Excellent  product and exceeded my expectations. Easy to set up and excitedly waiting for additional applications. Currently works very well with Netflix and YouTube on iOS.
081099741X|5.0|This is one of the best art books I've ever purchased. It's rich with content, behind the scenes photos, exclusive illustrations, and excellent interviews with Wes Anderson. To be honest, I think the book is worth triple what I paid for it. I'm not sure how Amazon can even sell it for $25.00 when it has so pages filled with beautiful photos. I bought a second copy for a friend and plan to buy a few more for Christmas Gifts. If you're a Wes Anderson fan, and you should be, I highly recommend this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just can't get enough of this game! I have ALWAYS thought the minions were adorable, and now I get to play with one everyday lol! I am so glad I downloaded this game and I recommend it to ALL my friends and family all the time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy playing the game. its neat how they have all animals from the movies. I cant stop playing the game's
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I just started watching castle few weeks ago. Iv made it to season 5 so far, it's a good season so far.
B008602KQI|4.0|The book was much better as far as the story goes but Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job. Loved Lenny Kravitz in this too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is very captivating, trying your best to analyze the scene and piece together the clues in order to escape and move to the next level. Each level requires you to think differently and memorize clues and tricks you learned in the previous levels
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I really enjoyed the first 60 percent of this novel, but felt that the later section got into trouble. My favorite King books are The Shining, The Stand, Thinner, and (strangely) Cell, largely because those brilliant works all share the same concepts which I love.<br />1) There's a malevolent force that's far more powerful than the tiny group of good guys fighting against it.<br />2) The good characters are outnumbered, and hopelessly outmatched.<br />3) They get hurt.<br />4) At least one of them dies--usually a major character.<br />5) Against their will they are forced to make a final, desperate stand.<br />6) Almost impossibly, they win.<br />Dr. Sleep started out with the promise of containing all of those exciting ideas, but then it felt like King couldn't bear to hurt or scare his own characters too much, especially Abra. I never seriously doubted that she'd come out on top, not even for a minute. None of his heroes ever seemed in grave enough danger, and I wanted the cost of their victory to be higher.<br />That said, for me, the opening half of this novel showcases some of King's best work in many years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, I play it at least three times a day, it is fun, frustrating and exciting not to mention addictive
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Duolingo is a really fun app that helps you strengthen or learn a new language. It is easy and walks you through your learning really well. It is effective and really educational. For example I am a middle school student learning French in school and Duolingo really helps me memorize it at home. It is really easy to use and not a waste of your time. It is so good that I guarantee you will love it!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|brad pitt is the sexiest person to ever piss me off. his miracle cure is bs. &#34;oh look, im immune to zombies now!&#34; BS!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is the strongest proof of Life After Death that I have ever encountered in my 80 years on this earth!
B0018CENUC|5.0|I listen to Toby Keith when I walk at the track and I find it gives a terrific bounce to my steps as I go.  I love it!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I thought Man of Steel was awesome! It was visual masterpiece and the action was incredible. It did have its flaws though...I felt like they didn’t develop Superman/Clark Kent’s character as much I thought they should. But I did really like how they didn’t hold back on his powers at all. He was pretty super. For some reason I really like his heat vision like how veins around his eyes would slightly pop out like like he was using a muscle, great details!<br />I surprisingly really liked Faora, she was a friggin’ badass and I also liked how they made General Zod’s character sympathetic and a monster at the same time.<br />A lot of information was jammed in this film, which could get overwhelming at times and pacing got weird like during the random flashbacks throughout the movie. Overall, it was better than I was expecting since I am not a fan of any of Zack Snyder’s movies. Man of Steel was a great start to what I hope more DC movies XD<br /><br />4 out of 5 Stars
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Enjoyed the book.  It was well written and easy to read.  It's a very sad story out of contemporary history.  My negative comment would be that the very end was a little cheesy which surprised me since the book was otherwise so well written.  Rated it 5 stars anyway but was torn between 4 or 5 stars because of this.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I watched it with my kids and now I enjoy watchig it with my grandkids! It is funny and sweet with enough adult humor to keep me laughing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't load the game on all of my Kindles. Apparently Candy Crush Saga won't work on 1st Gen Kindles that are less that 18 mos old. This is a recurring issue with Amazon and the Kindle OS. It seems more and more apps are not supported for the 1st gen Kindles. Way to look out for your early adopters Amazon. I bought 3 1st gens (for the same price as 1 iPad) and now I'm feeling kind of left behind and ignored. There hasn't been a significant update to the OS, just new Kindle versions of the HW. I bought a Kindle because I didn't want to get caught in the Apple world of constantly upgrading to the latest and greatest, but at least I can get OS updates on my 3rd gen iPod touch and be able to play the new games. Come on Amazon there is now reason why you should ignore your loyal customers who got in the game early. If this continues I can promise you a couple things... My next tablet will be a Google Nexus and my Prime subscription will be history.<br /><br />As for the game itself, it works on the only 2nd gen Kindle in the house and now everyone wants to play.<br /><br />--------------------------- UPDATE 10/18/2013 ------------------------------------------<br />It looks as though this App is now compatible and works with all three of the 1st gen Kindles in the house. Good job Amazon and King.com I now have three very happy people who can play candy crush.<br />I guess it should get the 5 stars after all!!<br /><br />Now let's get to work on getting that watch Disney Jr. App working on the older Kindles.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is the perfect connector for the job and anyone who needs one will be happy with this easy purchase.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book-it was not what what I expected. I would like to read more books by this author.
0345803493|5.0|Omg I love this book. I have read it in a week and working on the second book then ordering the third book.
B0083Z614S|4.0|An orphaned little girl, a little boy who has been lead to believe he's an invalid and a lower class little boy  with a love for nature and all living things come together and the magic happens. A very uplifting book!
B0091THRCU|1.0|I had similar cases but they were made of cheap materials and didn't last long so I was very excited to read that this one is made of real leather and all the great reviews of this product that I bought 2 for my iPhone 5 and 1 for the galaxy for my friend. When I tried to put my phone in ( I have a very slim case), the phone wouldn't fit. Thinking that it just needs to be broken in, I forced it in half way and the phone got stuck and I couldn't get it out. I ended up cutting the case open at the seams to get the phone out. Since I bought a 2nd case, I tried it again, removing my slim case this time, again the phone got stuck half way and neither go down nor could it come back out. It was stuck really bad, In pure frustration, I cut the seams again just to get my phone out and to avoid damaging it. I love this type of case with the pull out tab but this case is just WAy too tight. I understand it loosens with use, but I can't even get pass the first use. Wasted money on 2 cases! Worst purchase ever
B0052RE4MQ|1.0|The series is try aerated<br />Retarted idiotic mental stupid horrid audio I hated every last word in the last book
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|had some troubles with the streaming from netflix. chrome browser streams well and youtube streams well. chrome browser streams well and youtube streams well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey!!!  I can not wait for season 4.  I enjoyed watching season 3 on amazon prime.  Thank you for making it available.
B003WE9TU8|2.0|Granted, I didn't finish this book. However, I did enjoy what I read - the first half. Then it all just became too much of the same. The part I read was completely plausible (if Zombies happened to try to take over the world, I am almost certain that this book would be a great guide and will tell governments exactly what not to do and yet they will still handle it exactly like in this book).<br /><br />But the actual zombies stop after about a third of the book and then the aftermath just continues, forever. I just have too much to read at the moment to finish it. But if the zombie apocalypse does happen, this will be my go to guide.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I choose solitaire because I love playing the game. I would recommend this to anyone that likes to play cards.
B008EL25LE|2.0|It works great after you first install the game. But after &quot;save&quot; and exit and then come back later to play, all you get is a white screen. I kept unistalling and reinstalling it,and as long as I played right away it worked. Of course  ever time reinsalled I had start the game over again :(. I am glad I did not to pay for this.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Like it's been said, &#34;All good things have to come to an end&#34; well this is one of them. Absolutely loved it, entertaining, thrilling and most of all intriguing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think Candy Crush is an award game! It's challenging, yet fun. It makes you think. You should purchase Candy Crush because of my review. Thank you for considering Candy Crush!
B00F880BWG|5.0|5 stars all the way, great series...the drama, gore. George romero the king of zombie flicks has gotta be loving this show. Cant wait til next episode
B002NXPTDK|5.0|Awesome album every song is good.<br />The songs are Not mainstream and they have a lot of emotion in every single one.
B00FEJHPRI|3.0|Tony Stark is a flawed hero ... we get that. But in the first two Iron Man movies Tony was a flawed hero with an emphasis on HERO. In this movie the protagonist is a flawed hero with the emphasis on FLAWED.<br /><br />Also, this movie is loosely based on the \\"Extremis\\" story arch from the comics, but the story was butchered in order to make it work for the movie. If the Extremis storyline in the comics ended like the movie version it probably would have been one of the most hated stories in the Iron Man series.<br /><br />Bottom line, the visuals and the acting save this movie. The horrible writing and direction kill it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's awesome I will play it every day of my life until I die . I recommend  u to get the name now before it cost money
B006LSZECO|5.0|First time I've read this author.  Good pace.  My jaw actually dropped more than once.  Highly recommend.  Just bought two more of her novels.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is an amazing game. You hat to breed dragons, feed dragons, and evolve them too! It is an exciting game to play and so much fun. I would recommend at least trying the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting. Thank you AMAZON for making it available to all Kindle players! It's nice that our wishes are heard. Great game for all!
1400052181|5.0|The way that story has been told! AMAZING!! o:)<br /> Tle immortal life of Henrietta Lacks can be described on of the most amazing real life story!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It's fun, just too many adds for my taste, and they play the same one over and over again. Less adds, more stars
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This was my first purchase of a TV show and it was well worth the investment. I got hooked on 'Castle' watching re-runs and, as season 6 was about to begin I realized I'd yet to see season 5. You kept me in the loop. Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|LOVE CRUSHING CANDY AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY! Colorful, puzzling, and always fun! I hope the saga never ends because we love candy!
B00E9P959O|4.0|I'm keeping my original, as I never really had any problems with it, sonically . . . but this remix is a fun listen to another take on the mixing of this album. It definitely has a more open sound, and you can certainly hear all the work Geddy put into the vocals better, as well as more of Alex guitar (including the &#34;more&#34; he added!). Really dig it. Any Rush fan, and fan of this great collection of songs, won't be disappointed by what they hear at all.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app really helped me keep track of my battery level and I love how you can change the color of the battery
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I've always liked One Republic since Apologize but I've really come to really become a fan with this album. Counting Stars, If I Lose Myself and Good Life are all great hits. Even the ones that are not played on the radio are awesome too, I Lived, Preacher...<br /><br />Ryan's vocal has a very wide range and enables him to be adventurous. The lyrics is thought-provoking and has more depth than songs of other more popular bands.
B005PK57IK|5.0|What a great lawyer show! It is good to see people from ER in this series. I cannot wait till next season. It is great to have all seasons available.<br />Dr George Tomes
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Delightful show.  Great actors and storyline. I only wish there were more seasons to watch.  Worth watching, highly recommend any episode.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I am pleased withe product so far . It's still evolving so its capabilities are limited. There are still quite a few  issues to be resolved YouTube streams fine to my Samsung but the Tab Cast still in Beta Mode will work intermittently
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So I can't give it a poor rating, because I will never read it or see the movie. And I could give a crap who the lead characters are. However, my wife loves the series, the movie character vetting process, and so do all of her friends with boobs.<br /><br />It did produce one of the most brilliant SNL digital shorts...
B001992NW4|5.0|Despite some excessively, and unnecessary, indulgent visual trickery, Friedkan's mid 70's masterpiece about evil incarnate stands as one of the finest films of its respective genre.  Powerful performances - especially from Von Sydow and MIller; the film that set the bar for everything of its kind to follow.  Mark Leier
B00EOO55GW|5.0|This album is AMAZING!! I love this band and they always come out with greaqt music. If you love G&R, Metallica, Avenged sevenfold puts a little bit of everything into their music and Freakin rocks it out!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is ok but not the best. It is not even close to minecraft but it is really fun.I rate it 3 and a half stars. I like waffles!<br /><br />  - jackoo21
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been writing and waiting for this game to be available on the kindle fire.  And now it has.  I love you guys.  Now if I can only catch up to my FB friends' lol.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am impressed, the ability to describe the terrible struggle of a person with an addiction, his determination to quit, along with a horror story, are both sublime and honest.<br />Couldn't be happier, if they make a movie out of this book, please, let James McAvoy be Daniel, he was born for this role.
B009ZOCLD6|5.0|Indisputably Lisa Batiashvili is nowadays super star of the violin. Whatever she cooses to play will sell out the hall, whatever she chooses to record will raise a huge acclaim. I was ione of the privileged members of the audience at her recent performance (September 2013) in Bucharest on the stage of the George Enescu International Festival where Lisa was paired by the phenomenal Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and its chief conductor Mariss Jansons.<br /><br />Here Batiashvili plays an interesting repertoire coupling Johannes Brahms mighty Concerto in D major with three Romances for violin and piano by Clara Schumann. This link deepens the mystery veiling the relation between the two. What is certain is the emotional flow that fulfills the proceedings. More majestic, the Concerto is a suitable vehicle for Lisa’s tremendous artistry, while Romances favor the poetic sensitivity, of her lyrical side. Not to be neglected Lisa’s partners for this CD: Staatskapelle Dresden under Christian Thielemann (in Brahms) and pianist Alice Sata Ott (in Clara Schumann). They offer intelligent supportive accompaniment to showcase violinist’s skills, although the recorded sound lacks somehow in aliveness.<br /><br />All in all, a valuable recording featuring a wonderful violinist in a cornerstone of her instrument’s repertoire!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love it. I'm an 11 year old and I'm super addicted. Great pastime and entertaining. Great for people of all ages.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|Just thought it was very entertaining and had a nice story.  The  Actors were wonderful also.  Would recommend it to all my Girlfriends.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Elton, but I do own a lot of his CD's. I find this to be one of the best collections of songs that he has recoreded since \\"Mad Men Across The Water\\". There seems to be a passion in his songs that I have not heard in some time. Even if your not a big fan of Elton I think you would find this to be a good choice to buy. I have truely enjoyed this CD.
B00BEEKN26|4.0|I bought this because I was too impatient to wait for the ending, and I hate commercials. The reason for the not 5 star rating is because I guessed the killer in the second episode. I never try to guess, lest I spoil a program for myself. I am<br />going to rewatch it and try to figure out how I deduced despite my will. Definitely worth watching though.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|The effects here are average, the acting bland, the effects mixed. But somehow, this is one of those B movies that just sucks you in. I was paying attention throughout this movie and, despite the low budget, a few of the effects honestly gave me chills. I went for this one on a purely emotional level.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|There are many reasons to buy anything you really like from the UK, as nearly everything is shortened or changed somehow for U.S. consumption. Masterpiece Theatre is great, but I want to see the whole program. This is the only way to do that. Downton Abbey has such wonderful actors I don't much care about the plot. It's worth it to hear Maggie Smith's one-liners. Nobody does it better.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I watched season 6 at least 5 times since receiving the dvd's. The quality of the dvd's is fine and this is the funniest show ever!!
B006K1IIAC|5.0|I have watched many productions but this one is imaginative and modern, fast-paced and believable, at least while i am watching. I have rewatched the episodes many times and am mesmerized and in their world each time. My  favorites are the first and last, those two I've lost count of the repeats.  The Woman (aaaah) is a favorite also. They are on  Netflix right now but won't be forever. Multi-region players are extremely inexpensive, and you get the full story. Masterpiece edits for time.
B00CATONCA|3.0|I was expecting a MUCH bigger product. I thought the case was going to be a couple feet high with larger heads. There are no measurements listed, but it is about a foot high and the heads are about the size of Barbie doll heads. I was very disappointed when I saw the size. The light up feature is indeed very cool and intriguing to look at. But this &#34;toy&#34; is not worth $100. It's cool, but I just want measurements provided before I spend that much in a Macfarlane toy. But hey, I got the season, and that's the best thing about this set.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I wanted to watch this when it was in theaters. However, I didn't get a chance to until I purchased the DVD and this movie was just simply awesome. I loved the storyline and the graphics of the Kaiju as well as the Jaegers as they battle it out is just amazing! I wished there were more movies like this!
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Great kids movie. As an adult I was hoping for more adult innuendos. But it was a very cute caption of cave man meets modern teenager.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Interesting story line. Very imaginative! Special effects are a bit lame. But, if I had to pick between a good story and good special effects, I will always pick a good story.<br /><br />On that count, Dr. Who delivers!
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|All and all a great wonderfully made movie but....I grew up reading the book, it is prob still my favorite. There are a lot of things that disappointed me. The one that got me the most was the way they did the character thorn. He didn't have a large nose or even a decent beard. His face looked too human. He didn't talk like you would expect from a dwarf.like a lot of the dwarves he also wasn't squatty looking just like short humans. Also with the character bilbo they seemed to stray from the book. Hobbits aren't completely helpless they can move quickly and quietly and aren't stupid. I also hated how most of the movie they treated him as an outcast while in the book he was truly part of the company. And wasn't always quiet in the back. he was a part of the adventure and there was hardly ever a word about bilbo not being able to fulfill his agreement. And hobbits are shorter than dwarves and chubbier with furry feet not just giant awkward feet with a little hair growing out of them. They also removed the fact that eagles talked to them after they were saved I'm worried they will do the same with smaug and the talk he and bilbo had was an interesting part of the book. And in the next movie the spiders talk while bilbo listens to what they plan to do with the dwarves. Plus the white Orc had nothing to do with the book but I'll admit that was a nice touch.  Don't get me wrong it's still a wonderful movie but if you haven't read the book yet wait until you've seen all the movies. I still give it 4stars
B00EH0K9H8|5.0|(Previous remarks removed by poster bc distributor has made good on promise.)<br /><br />Update: Oct. 31, 2013- replacement bluray arrives and does appear to read tho I have not had time to view the entire program yet. A review of the performance to follow...<br /><br />Thank you to Bill Evans and MPL for expediting deliveries despite my earlier skepticism to the contrary. My cynicism sometimes gets the better of me and I forget that decent human beings still do exist, however rare that may be.<br /><br />Update: Nov. 11, 2013- I have watched this bluray twice now and all is well. MPL made good on delivery and the disc plays perfectly.<br />As for the performances, there are simply no words to describe the joy... No blathering over the music, just full, epic, flawless playing. I'm SO glad they got this fixed. If you buy this & get a bum copy, it sucks I know, but don't worry... it's absolutely worth the wait once you finally see the show. Every track is pitch perfect and the sound quality is spectacular.<br /><br />Thank you, Flying Colors! Can't wait for the next record! Please do another bluray concert, too. Just maybe next time cross all the T's and dot a few i's before release day.<br /><br />Peace-
055357342X|5.0|Fantastic addition to my collection. It's a great book overall and I would recommend it to anyone who reads the books or watches the show.
B000P0J024|5.0|Awesome power house musicians! This is a very select group of guitar players and in each song you can pick up on the different personalities. Different, but certainly the group blends well.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|I've seen some of the negative reviews about this album (...The Last Ship has sailed, A Shipwreck at Best, etc.) while listening to the album and in part I took it in stride. While listening to the first album of Sting material in 10 years I had the epiphany \\"Is this the Sting that dominated radio in the 80's & early 90's?\\"  No.  It's better.  While listening to these songs, I also asked myself if I was the same person from back in the day when Sting penned classics such as Message in a Bottle were brand new?  No.  In some ways, I'm better and matured.    It's very safe to say that these new songs are not Radio friendly.  In all honesty, radio friendly music today is for the young & intellectually incurious.  The songs that are radio friendly lack depth, emotion, soul & most of all have nothing to say.    These new songs by Sting not only have more depth, but the songs are about something (not to say that the songs back then weren't.  Because they were) but they're more visceral, tangible and have something to say.  Not overproduced Electronic drivel (Did someone mention Sacred Love?)  These are songs that take the listener on an interesting adventure, made with real instruments and real musicians and sounds great at a small neighborhood pub (What have we got).  These songs are going to be around for a while.    Some of my favorites from the new batch are (And Yet, What have we got, Language of Birds (Underground River), The Ballad of the Great Eastern and Practical Arrangement)    Been listening to Sting since his early Police days.  These are some really good songs that share connective tissue with The Soul Cages.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is exactly like the flooded run style game market.  My kid seems to like it since its the Minions,  It keeps them occupied for about 5 minutes before they move onto something else.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  My favorite part of each level are the &#34;differences&#34; pictures...enjoy the challenge.  My least favorite part was having items to find that I could not identify because the picture was either too small or it was simply something I was unfamiliar with.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I feel as if this is slower than any other facebook app I use.  I have also noticed it takes a week or two to do updates after the other apps have been released on full androids and iOS devices.  Majority of the time on both kindles the pictures don't sure right away it takes a long time to scroll.  I know its not my internet seeing all the other tablets work perfectly fine with it.
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|What's more to say?  The movie is a classic that's always enjoyable.  I picked this up for $5 too, so you can't beat the price.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Star Wars and Angry Birds, that's all you need to know.  This is probably the best game to play to past time, like all other angry bird games its pretty simple to play.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Exciting read. Couldn't put it down. Ending was not what I expected at all. Interesting to see how this will be made into a movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is by far the best running game on any tablet/mobile platform. Its addicting and a great  time waster. you can link it to facebook and try to beat all your friends best scores.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Absolutely love this game. It is just so darn addicting. This is a great game for passing time. There aren't too many games out there that I really get into, but for some reason this I can't put this one down. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B0014J8D9Q|4.0|I hate to see Morgan Freeman die in this movie. Gene Hackman was a horrible person and I think Clint Eastwood was fantastic; just kill them all as he did.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Smart comedy that I loved to watch while at college. It's great to revist my favorite episodes, and Dan Harmon and cast do commentary on every episode
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I see now that Daniel Jackson was the pivot character in this story - he solved the riddle of the Stargate, he communicated and made connections with the indigenous peoples of the first planet visited, he stayed behind when all the other survivors returned to Earth, and he prepared for the eventual return of the Stargate teams. James Spader is such a wonderful actor, and he's even more awesome in his latest NBC series The Blacklist. While I'm unsure whether Kurt Russell's heart was in this project, the film delivers on many levels, and sets the future stage for ten seasons of Stargate on TV. One of my Top Ten favorite films, for sure.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Well I like this book an I think it should be more of the in different kinds of these books by different authors
B000TERI3O|5.0|We loved these songs and played them all the time on the old LP player.  hadn't found a good version of them on CD until now.  Hubby is glad to have it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG I'm so glad they finally got candy crush saga I been waiting so long I would check for it every day now I'm a happy customer!!!!!!
B006CHML4I|5.0|This watch probably isn't for everyone. It's an automatic which means you have to wear it to wind it. There is no battery and will stop if it doesn't move enough. Also, you may need to have it adjusted a little. Mine lost 5 seconds per day the first day. I've adjusted it to get it a little closer to perfect but it's more art than science and you have to be careful.<br /><br />A Quartz Eco-drive is probably better suited for most people but for those who love watches and love having an automatic movement, this is a brilliant watch for an incredible price.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|We have a copy and a great grand daughter wants one for her fifth birthday.  Amazon's the best for offerings, savings and fast delivery.  Disney always puts out a pretty good fairy tale type movie.
B001TM14VC|4.0|I like this movie. great story line, acceptable acting, famous actors while they were really young plus good music. Now, please watch this movie than go watch Hot Shots part one. You will not be disappointed, trust me.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I just started reading it, and what I´ve read is very interesting, clear, and I enjoy the way Pam explains how our thoughts manifest in our daily lliving. Great bok
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Do I dare to say this re-make is much batter than Sly Stallone's Judge Dredd? I believe I will say that. Core concept in this remake stays same. Futuristic Earth but over crowded, high crime, I mean it is a horrible future. After that two movie goes their separate ways. No reason to talk about old version. This new version takes place in a single location but full of action. Cool effects and when I tell you in this movie hero runs out of bullets, believe it. Dredd goes into a Mega building block  to investigate murder of three people with a rookie assign to him to evaluate, things go bad to worse. he gets trapped in the building with almost 100 drug users who has automatic weapons. Instead of hiding and trying to stay alive until back up arrives ( one he hopes he might get), best defense is offense, he starts hunting down these drug cartel members and destroys their drug lab finally killing the leader, a prostitute turn drug dealer. You will enjoy the movie. no nudity but lots of violence and gore. You decide how old your kid should be to watch it. Again, if you have Amazon prime, movie is FREE
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I won't go into the story as there are enough out there to do that but I really thought the characters were real and believable which to me is critical in a good book. I was disappointed that we never heard from Will, it would have been nice to hear what his thinking was from his own perspective. Parts of the book are real tear-jerkers.
B00008S7KC|2.0|Doesn't play in region 1 so it doesn't work for me although it said all regions it doesn't play in all of them
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is about huge, extremely awesome, alien fighting, robots.<br /><br />I give the story line about the people a 4 out of 10.  However, the effects, combat, and length of action completely make up for the lack of human connection.  The acting was good, with a few exceptions.<br /><br />In the end it doesn't matter.  The combat scenes with the robots and long and well thought out.  It has a sense of realism just because it doesn't get cut-off due to budget.  You want mega robot combat, you get it.<br /><br />Watch it, buy it, enjoy it.
159562015X|1.0|I purchased the book hoping it would help me in forming my resume and finding my strengths.  I read Part I and when I got to the part where you are suppose to do the assessment I opened the envelope & took off the sticker but NO CODE to speak of I am EXTREEMLY disappointed I had a purpose of my purchase & now I have just wasted money I don't have to waste.  I am unemployed & I at this point either want my money back or EMAIL me the code.  DO NOT PURCHASE NO CODE COMES WITH BOOK AS EXPECTED!!
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|This movie certainly is good.  It had the feature of not being full of the usual cliches that you often find in sci-fi.  Both Will and Jaden did a great job, and the story kept moving all the way through.<br /><br />Will's role stands back a bit from what you would expect.  Of course, the effects were outstanding.  So, if you want some serious entertainment, but don't want to have to think much, I recommend watching this movie.<br /><br />As for buying it, you'll have to really like it.  Given the other electronic media in the modern world, I probably didn't need to all out purchase it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|My son just got me hooked on Thrones. I started to read the books and am enthralled. I have finished the first and in the middle of the second, but I also keep up with the episodes. What fun.
031623480X|5.0|This goes along the same lines as &#34;wheat belly&#34; though it talks about what grains do to the brain and the negative effects it has on it and how to heal. It's clearly written, easy to understand, yet has a lot of science backing as well. That's a perfect book to me! And it works! Cutting grains out has made me feel a zillion times better!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is an amazing show. I like all the characters of it. Story line and screenplay are also very good.
0525478817|4.0|Love stories. All books these days seem to be these. Almost all love stories are just the typical high school relationship- two teens fall in love, have some problems, and end up living happily ever after. Now don't get me wrong, I love a good love story, and that's just it. The key word is good. All love stories nowadays seem to be replicas of another one. Same plotline with a few changes and it gets boring after awhile.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars by John Green is another love story but not your typical one and definitely does not fall into the category of replicas. This story takes you through the twists and turns of Hazel and Augustus' relationship. When I heard about this book, I knew I had to read it. Everyone seemed to be in love with it, and I had not heard one bad thing about it. I figured I'd give it a try and see what all the hype was about. You could say I had high expectations and those expectations were met, if not exceeded. The moment I opened this book, I fell into the story. I laughed when the characters laughed, I cried when they cried, I really felt like I was apart of them or they were my friends. The cancer twist kept me on the edge of my seat because anything could happen at any moment. Hazel and Augustus were so different, yet so alike. It takes a lot for me to cry when I'm reading something, and this novel was one of the few that me cry.<br /><br />Now, some may argue that Augustus and Hazel's language are too sophisticated and they aren't relatable to teens, but that's life. Obviously not all teenagers in the real world are going to talk like they do, but I can assure you that some do, you may just not know them. The characters will not be relatable to everyone because no one has the same story as someone else. I think it all depends on your perspective on things and what you've been through. I'll admit, I didn't relate to them. But I don't have cancer and I don't have any friends with cancer. You don't have to relate to the charactersin a book for it to be a great story.<br /><br />I do have one small complaint though. The book was slow. What do I mean by that? I felt like it dragged on a little bit. It was around chapter 12 or 13 where the story really took off and I literally could not put the book down. I just wish the book would have picked up a bit sooner, but it was still one of the best books, and love stories, I have ever read. It was refreshing to read this novel, and not be bored. I had no clue what to expect and I hadn't ever read a book like this before. It was an emotional, heartwarming, and wonderful love story between two lovesick teenagers who just happened to be fighting an illness. I can promise you that when you read this book, you will cry at some points and you will cheer at others. You won't ever be able to guess what's about to happen.
B00DYEBM2Y|5.0|Thank for this and the warm feelings that came back from the last album. A vintage quality where I'll listen again and again for years.
B00FF8OKJE|4.0|Am only a level 7 but it is fun so far I will keep playing maybe write another review later ..not an easy game it takes time to be good at it. Haven't had problems so far as far as how it plays on my kindle downloaded and plays great and I haven't bought anything to play it
B000NGTJTY|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. Great job Leonardo, Jack  Best movie in the last 10 years blu ray is great
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Action packed from the get go! Love Brad Piit, he always makes you forget it's him and immerses you in his characters. One negative, I didn't believe the wife, she smiled too much in trying to show you she was in control for both the kids sake and his. But over all, the movie peeked one's interest through out! Wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars but couldn't figure out how to.
140006922X|1.0|Aside from some grammatical mistakes, the book was excellent. Sometimes Aslan mixes up historical sources with the kinds of apocryphal sources he denigrates, but in general the scholarship is creditable. I like the subject. It's about time someone wrote a clear-eyed summary of what exactly is known about Jesus. His discussion of the environment of the Middle East at the time of Jesus's life is first rate.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I really wanted to love this book but it was a long and slow read. I just couldn't connect with the characters no matter how hard I tried.  It seemed disjointed and confusing at times but finally came together in the end, which at times felt like it would never come.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Quirky and sad with a beautiful ending. Harold Fry is an unlikely protagonist and the reluctant pilgrim. The people he meets on his journey create the fabric of his life story. Could not put it down.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|game kept me occupied following surgery.  thanks for not letting me die of boredom.  it was an ever growing experience.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|An amazing read. The unexpecting narrator takes his time in realising that he is actually in love with the most unsuitable of selections of marital partners. Rosie has her own challenges in life and our hero does his best to complete. A fabulous read.<br />(
B00F880BWG|5.0|This show isn't just gore. It has characters that develop and you care about them. You don't want them to die and you are saddened when one does. Now add the gore and action on top of that and you have one awesome show.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|It seems wrong to rate and review this book after reading it, so effective was the message of this book that I now question even reviewing it. With growing horror I read as Mae was drawn deeper and deeper into the Circle, conversations with her co-workers and bosses on the surface seem harmless and even reasonable at the time but you can't shake the deeper more sinister undercurrents. There have been many comparisons to 1984 by other reviewers and that comparison is apt, only this time we conduct the surveillance on ourselves. There's no need for Big Brother, we are all Big Brother.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a great tale of two women and how their lives intersect. The characters are well written. You will not be disapointed.
B00F91H666|3.0|A new take on an old tale, the film was visually appealing but emotionally dull. One might call it lifeless...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is amazing. It's so handy to not have to pull out the old calculator every time I need to add/subtract or any other calculation!
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|You have to listen carefully, as there are several turns in this movie, that keep it exciting. Well worth watching

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book had me in its grip from the moment I started reading it. I couldn't look away, it affected my work day and other activities and the best part was that it wasn't a disappointing ending, which is what I didn't like about &#34;Duma Key&#34;. I got &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; because I loved &#34;The Shining&#34; and the synopsis was similar to &#34;The Talisman&#34; and &#34;Black House&#34;, two books I read long ago by King and Peter Straub.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|my husband and i really enjoyed watching this series. we love to watch horrors and thriller type shows. currently watching season 3 on fox. good buy
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|this story became interesting about at the half way mark  not Stephen king's best effort  I would not recommend this book
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I absolutely love this movie; it's such an amazing story and was very well done. I could watch it over and over!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played it for years and still think it is fun to see if I can win.  I don't want to move on to something different.  Also, the game does not always let you win.  Sometimes it is very mean in that regard.  I do enjoy playing even if I don't win. I find it very relaxing and it reduces my blood pressure like a meditation.  I know there is Luminosity as a way to stimulate one's brain also.  It is a bit more time consuming and not relaxing - more stress of a test activity.  One always wants to better the score.
B001L5YW9I|3.0|The acting and location of the movie were great, but it was too gory and sad for me. It's a great one if you like that kind of stuff though!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I saw the movie at least 2 times on TV and know I have read the book long ago. It is a book I would read again.  The draw if the family life.  I wanted it on Kindle to read again.
B00005JLF5|1.0|I ordered this set of discs as a birthday present for my husband, who's never seen DS9. But the discs would not load in the DVR or in the computer. I have returned the set and am awaiting a refund.
B00A287PG2|5.0|Very well written and complete history of McKinsey's leadership. Not recommended for those who want details of day to day operations. This is a book about the C-Suite.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|this film has to be one of the worst scifi films of all time, AWEFULL acting on behalf of young Mr Smith, shame dad did'nt help him out or guide him through, i am sure i will not be watching another Smith film in the future
0553293397|5.0|enough said.<br />isaac asimov is my favorite author and all his book are just really thrilling and at the same time educating i recommend any book he has written.
B00DQT1EOI|5.0|This multimedia book clearly conveys marketing practioners' views on big data opportunities and challenges. (McKinsey consultants and industry leaders) It does not have technical details, but it is good for a perspective.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Smart and funny show, perfect for all ages. Stories are told through visuals, music, sound effects, and gestures so they are easy to understand no  regardless of the languages you speak.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great mix of scifi, drama, action, and character development! Great special effects too. I hope season 3 comes out before I finish season 2.
B000007VLL|4.0|Great album, has lots of good songs on it, takes me back to the 80's- and has great sound quality
B002QNTNL6|1.0|We watched it half way through and got bored. It was just too cookie cutter and simplistic for us. Not recommended.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I love anything Fleetwood Mac, but this one was a little different, didn't have the same old same old, had old, newer, and a mix. Definitely a classic to own if you love Fleetwood MaC- and hey, who doesn't?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34; was very exciting to read.<br />I especially liked how the author included a reference  in the book to<br />Joe Hill's book &#34;Nos4a2&#34;.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved the book! Much more detail than the movie and was a great read! I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the movie!
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I remember when I saw the first trailer for Gravity. My wife thought it looked stupid. I thought it could go in several directions, so I thought I would keep an open mind. From that trailer, you would likely come to several conclusions. First, you might think the movie was trying a bit too hard to be dramatic. You also might conclude that it would be a terrifying, graphic, horror story of a sci-fi. You also might conclude that it would have overblown acting and direction that tries too hard to be edgy (in addition to dramatic). And yet...you might also conclude that this film would be DIFFERENT from the sci-fi that has come before, and break new ground if it met it's seemly lofty ambitions. Well the film is out and it is nothing you feared and everything you might have hoped for and more.<br /><br />The Most Beautiful Realistic Science Fiction Yet Filmed<br /><br />The film begins, and you are treated to the most astounding CGI/optical special effects yet seen for realistic astronaut work/spacewalk. A single, long, LONG shot allows the scene to unfold. The sheer beauty of the scene's visuals opens our eyes to how astoundingly beautiful the Earth must be from orbit. Throughout the film, if you have any appreciation at all for cinematography, visual effects, and just plain splendid film visuals in general you WILL be amazing. The way the opening sceene unfolds is more than that though. It's great film-making. The astronauts talk, Mission Control advises, the the astronauts go about their daily work. And then...all heck breaks loose.<br /><br />\\"What do I do? WHAT DO I DO!?!?\\"<br /><br />If you've watched ANY of the trailers for this film, you should know by now that it's a disaster movie...in SPACE. In a space of moments, events transpire that take everything from tranquil to terrifying. If you were to judge this film based on trailer alone though, you would miss something very important indeed.<br /><br />From a two minute snippet of a film like this you can see the build-up. You are acclimated to a situation, then the music, the visuals, the dialog, and perfect direction quickly make you feel the gravity of the situation. In zero gravity, object have momentum and inertia until they are acted up by an outside force. In plain-speak this means if something is moving 20,000 miles per hour and heading your way, it keeps rocketing at that speed until it slams into you with unimaginable force. Likewise, if something is moving only 50 miles per hour in zero-G it just keeps right on coming, and unless you have friction (thrust), you won't change velocity until that thing (again) slams right into you. When the only thing keeping you alive is a few centimeters of cloth and a tank of oxygen, that's absolutely terrifying, and the director makes you feel it, see it, hear it, and experience it with amazing realism.<br /><br />While mileage will of course vary, I am of the personal opinion that Sandra Bullock gives the performance of a lifetime and one that will define her entire career as the newbie astronaut Ryan, and George Clooney is splendid as the veteran astronaut Matt. They both come across as believable, and as I watched the film I felt very much taken along for the journey (thinking about just what I would do if I were in that situation).<br /><br />\\"I hate space!\\"<br /><br />Now, if you have ever seen a disaster movie in your life, you know that they are a series of unfortunately coincidences one after another that keep the protagonist on the edge of near-death (with some breaks in between now and then so you can catch your breath). This film does not stray too far from that formula, except perhaps that it is directed less like a disaster film (no interventions from unexpected sources to save the day, and the dangers are all environmental/psychological, so you won't have to worry about any psychopaths with knives, insane robots on the loose, etc).<br /><br />Some people have said that this film is completely predictable, and othershave said it is completely original. The truth lies somewhere in between. I have often been very irritated that people continue to blast a film simply because it uses tropes (tropes are not bad), and embrace something that hasn't been very well-done simply because it isn't familiar to them. What I am trying to say is...this film is NOT original in the story it tells. We've had movies about survival against all-odds in a crisis situation for a long time. We've had a few decent films about real-world space travel as well. What we have NOT had, is a film THIS well-made about this story told in this AMAZING WAY.<br /><br />\\"Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.\\"<br /><br />Some people have (justifiably) complained about scientific inaccuracies in this film. The objects of certain objects aren't correct, or are in the wrong direction. The likelihood of a debris field of a certain size being created as a result of an impact in space. A Payload Specialist being called a Mission Specialist. The fact that the main character does not act like an astronaut and acts more like you or I would... Yeah, some things bothered me too. If you know anything about NASA, a Mission Specialist trains like CRAZY. They don't let failures or people with obvious psychological issues on spaceflights (unless, again, they are just there to do one thing, in which case they aren't trained at all for spaceflight maneuvering [if any astronauts want to correct me my source is Wikipedia]). But after seeing the movie all the way through...none of that matters.<br /><br />For one thing, this film is just far enough off from the real world that I can call it's setting an alternate near-future Earth (Earth 2 if you will). In such a world, EVERYTHING that happens in the film is POSSIBLE. It's POSSIBLE that NASA runs out of money and skimps on training, but gives a bit of extra training for emergencies. It's POSSIBLE that orbits are adjusted for one reason or another. And yes, it's possible that collisions happen, create a catastrophic debris field, and a person has to fight to survive the cold vacuum of space. And that possibility is what makes this film so darn amazing.<br /><br />When you see objects moving, spinning, acting upon each other, it is all INCREDIBLY real. With a very small suspension of disbelief, you can swallow everything that happens and just go along for the ride, enjoying that under the exact circumstances of the film, everything would transpire exact as seen (or as a book on writing sci-fi that I once read said, you can setup whatever rules you want for your story, you just have to obey them).<br /><br />\\"Either way, it's going to be one hell of a ride.\\"<br /><br />This is one wild roller-coaster of a movie, and it uses EVERY trick at the director's disposal to make you take this amazing journey. You will taken inside of an astronaut's helmet and be able to read the indicators in their HUD, you will watch objects burn up into the atmosphere, you will be with an astronaut as they tumble and spin out of control, out of breath, terrified out of their mind. And the beautiful, compelling, thrilling reality of it all will take your breath away.<br /><br />There are moments in this film that will stick with you forever. On this journey you will follow an astronaut's psychological death and rebirth, spelled-out in visuals that will easily make this among the highest ranked science fiction masterpieces ever made. There is no sound in space (though there is in the trailer, it is not there in the movie). The only sound effects are what a person inside a suit or spaceship would hear. The music more than makes up for it. Listening to it will make your heart pound. There is no closet horror here, no zombie hordes or dinosaur jack-in-the-box that leaps into view, and it isn't needed. The thrill of an escalating situation in space is all the terror you need.<br /><br />But thankfully, this film is more thrilling than terrifying. You will feel stressed, but you will not feel drained. You will be taken to a low point, and then your spirit will sail up into the sky along with the protagonist. This film is NOT a downer. It will make you want to cheer.<br /><br />\\"It's time to stop driving. It's time to go home.\\"<br /><br />Within the story of survival there is another story. A story of a woman who has given up on life, and is just going through the motions, and now has to make a decision about whether or not she wants to live, whether it's worth the harrowing journey to SURVIVE and walk out the other side of the cold dark tunnel. Some people may think this story is cliche, or boring, or unnecessary. I think it's humanizing, compelling, and inspiring.<br /><br />I'll make a confession. I AM a Sandra Bullock fan. I fell in love with her as a teen in \\"While You Were Sleeping\\". I've followed her career since then, and for me at least, she has always made an otherwise unwatchable movie one that I could enjoy (not a fan of Miss Congeniality or The Blind Side, but I watched both movies for her). I've been waiting though, for the movie that I would love her in more than anything she has ever done (much like I'm still waiting for the movie Daniel Craig or Jennifer Lawrence will be in that is good enough for me to want to own for a reason other than that he's in it and I like him). Well, for me, THIS is that movie.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is 49, but she has NEVER been in better form. She is gorgeous in this movie, a perfect representative for all women of humanity (I told you this was high-calibur sci-fi). She is at turns, normal, helpless, determined, angry, lost, strong, and at last, triumphantly spiritually transcendent. Ultimately, this is not a battle against the elements, but a battle against herself, and the conclusion is awe inspiring. The music, the visuals, and the actor combine to create scenes that are downright iconic, and the as I said, the end of this film will make you want to cheer.<br /><br />After seeing this film I could not stop thinking about. I cannot stop talking about it. When it comes out on Blu Ray I WILL buy it and treasure it forever. I had thought no film could be better than Oblivion this year, but this film IS BETTER (And here I thought for any film to be better than that one was impossible. Silly me.) Do yourself a favor. Go out to a theater immediately and see this film. Great, compelling, entertaining, glorious art like this deserves to be seen, appreciated, and celebrated.<br /><br />Oh, and it deserves to win Academy Awards for Best Actress, Best Director, Best Script, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Musical Score, and DEFINITELY Best Picture!collisions happen, create a catastrophic debris field, and a person has to fight to survive the cold vacuum of space. And that possibility is what makes this film so darn amazing.<br /><br />When you see objects moving, spinning, acting upon each other, it is all INCREDIBLY real. With a very small suspension of disbelief, you can swallow everything that happens and just go along for the ride, enjoying that under the exact circumstances of the film, everything would transpire exact as seen (or as a book on writing sci-fi that I once read said, you can setup whatever rules you want for your story, you just have to obey them).<br /><br />\\"Either way, it's going to be one hell of a ride.\\"<br /><br />This is one wild roller-coaster of a movie, and it uses EVERY trick at the director's disposal to make you take this amazing journey. You will taken inside of an astronaut's helmet and be able to read the indicators in their HUD, you will watch objects burn up into the atmosphere, you will be with an astronaut as they tumble and spin out of control, out of breath, terrified out of their mind. And the beautiful, compelling, thrilling reality of it all will take your breath away.<br /><br />There are moments in this film that will stick with you forever. On this journey you will follow an astronaut's psychological death and rebirth, spelled-out in visuals that will easily make this among the highest ranked science fiction masterpieces ever made. There is no sound in space (though there is in the trailer, it is not there in the movie). The only sound effects are what a person inside a suit or spaceship would hear. The music more than makes up for it. Listening to it will make your heart pound. There is no closet horror here, no zombie hordes or dinosaur jack-in-the-box that leaps into view, and it isn't needed. The thrill of an escalating situation in space is all the terror you need.<br /><br />But thankfully, this film is more thrilling than terrifying. You will feel stressed, but you will not feel drained. You will be taken to a low point, and then your spirit will sail up into the sky along with the protagonist. This film is NOT a downer. It will make you want to cheer.<br /><br />\\"It's time to stop driving. It's time to go home.\\"<br /><br />Within the story of survival there is another story. A story of a woman who has given up on life, and is just going through the motions, and now has to make a decision about whether or not she wants to live, whether it's worth the harrowing journey to SURVIVE and walk out the other side of the cold dark tunnel. Some people may think this story is cliche, or boring, or unnecessary. I think it's humanizing, compelling, and inspiring.<br /><br />I'll make a confession. I AM a Sandra Bullock fan. I fell in love with her as a teen in \\"While You Were Sleeping\\". I've followed her career since then, and for me at least, she has always made an otherwise unwatchable movie one that I could enjoy (not a fan of Miss Congeniality or The Blind Side, but I watched both movies for her). I've been waiting though, for the movie that I would love her in more than anything she has ever done (much like I'm still waiting for the movie Daniel Craig or Jennifer Lawrence will be in that is good enough for me to want to own for a reason other than that he's in it and I like him). Well, for me, THIS is that movie.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is 49, but she has NEVER been in better form. She is gorgeous in this movie, a perfect representative for all women of humanity (I told you this was high-calibur sci-fi). She is at turns, normal, helpless, determined, angry, lost, strong, and at last, triumphantly spiritually transcendent. Ultimately, this is not a battle against the elements, but a battle against herself, and the conclusion is awe inspiring. The music, the visuals, and the actor combine to create scenes that are downright iconic, and the as I said, the end of this film will make you want to cheer.<br /><br />After seeingthis film I could not stop thinking about. I cannot stop talking about it. When it comes out on Blu Ray I WILL buy it and treasure it forever.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Just finished reading this book for the second time. The first time was 27 years ago. It was just as good as I remembered it.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Hope this is not the end of this series. I need to know what happens with Gary, and if they have the happy ever-after.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I watched this movie in the theaters and I really liked it. What's not to like about giant robots fighting giant aliens? I also liked how the love interest for Charlie Hunnam's character was actually developed as a character as well instead of just being eye candy or whatever. I recommend this movie for anyone who loves movies like this. It doesn't disappoint.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally amazon has the real candy crush!! Most addicting game ever. I love it! I warn you don't start unless you plan on playing every free second you have.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Emotionally charged as all her music is, Born to Die is hardly my favorite track. Off to the races, Blue Jeans, Radio and Summertime Sadness make this album worth owning.
B00A46H3J6|4.0|Time has been kind to this fantastic collection.  Just as crisp , and relevant as when it first was released.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Sure, Grisham, you expect to read about lawyers, and you get lawyers.<br /><br />What you don't get is a courtroom story. And that's what I found great about this book. Grisham managed to stick to his core business, entertaining books about law-related stories, but also to bring a brand new twist to it.<br /><br />It's a great read, surprising story, a real page turner!
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|way too much foul language and over the top character development. Not like the same author that wrote The Shinning.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is challenging for both the mind and reflexes - take your time with puzzle mode or try a faster pace with a timed version!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King's writing and this was a great book. could hardly put it down. I have read everything he has written. I will read his next book.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When I buyed this app this morning by 6am The Appstore Said the App was Compatible today But It wasn't compatible yesterday BUT I LOVE THE GAME!!!!!!!!!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I love Brandon Sanderson's books............Steelheart is one that I could not put down. I read constantly.  Each novel I read takes about a couple of weeks.  This one took 3 days...........and I usually read when I'm dead tired.  Figure it out.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is an awesome movie in 2D, but in 3D it is even better. Delivery was on time and as promised. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|I found this movie though entertaining and heart warming near the end, the Croods were a very dysfunctional family... A lot of resentment toward character Guy by the father who believed he was being replaced. The Father wanting to knock off his mother-n-laws. An animalistic baby girl, a half brained son and a very passive mother. The daughter on the other hand was just your typical young girl wanting to see the world and what it offered. Overall I give it acceptable grade to watch with friends or family night.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Trek fans will love this movie, especially in 3D. Delivery was a day earlier than stated, which made me happy. Definitely a must have for your collection.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I did a bunch of research before I bought this CPU. Its the best bang for the buck, if you're considering getting the i5 or i7 I dont think its worth the extra money. Been running it for about 4 or 6 months now. Just yesterday overclocked it for the first time so we'll so how that goes :) I'll update this review if anything changes. 5 stars. The windows experience index gives it a 7.1 out of 7.9. but I dont know how much that matters.
B000IZ6FLK|1.0|Come on, really? I thought we were all done with rewarding eating disorders. Sure wouldn't mind my money back, because that was time I wont get back!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I always enjoy books by Nicholas sparks and loved this one as well  he knows how to make you feel part of the story
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game I played in a line time it's very addictive and fun to play. I'm glad I can finally play this game on my kindle.
B004W4N55C|1.0|Fail..no updates for tablets, crashes. contacted developers and they said to bad it is amazon's problem and ask them for a refund.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I just loved this book, even after reading it three times it still was filled with adventure! Just one problem- I could never go to sleep at night because I was so hooked! I to&#34;Tally&#34; recommend this book. (Haha) it was so &#34;bubbly&#34;!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app. It's very addicting and fun. My only gripe is that you either have to get very lucky on some levels or you have to buy the power ups. It's basically designed to get you to spend money. I don't choose to and am on level 156, but I get stuck sometimes for weeks.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love it. It's easy to use, it helps with pronunciation, and it teaches how to spell in the other language too. It's helpful and it's fun.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|KEEP ME IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND UP- TO- DATE WITH OTHER SITUATIONS ALSO MAKE NEW FRIENDS UP TO NOW IT'S WORKED OUT OK
B0063HC7EQ|5.0|ZAMM is a brilliant book that looks the very essence of our existence. Thought provoking and insightful. It has given me lots to think about
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg yesssss!!!!!  Candy crush is finally on kindle! I used to have to play on my friends ipod, but now its just right here!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Paul has been on a creative late-career peak and this new album keeps that track record going. Both Chaos and Creation (2005), and Electric Arguments (2008) were excellent; Memory Almost Full (2007), not so much. So I wasn't sure what we were going to get with this New album. And in a strange way I think New offers an excellent mix of the best of all three albums. There are gorgeous acoustic pieces like Early Days and On My Way to Work. There are fantastic experimental tracks like Alligator and Appreciate and Road. And there are more conventional pop songs like the title track New and Queenie Eye. Really there is not a bad track on this album, and no cringe-y moments like that Gratitude song on Memory Almost Full. Paul's lyrics are a mixed bag here -- as usual. But there are some really sharp lines (\\"I need a sweet communicator I can give my alligator to\\" is excellent!) My least favorite track is probably Everybody Out There, which is hobbled by some lazy lyrics (nothing embarrassing, just bland). The big surprise was how great the two bonus tracks are: Turned out and Get Me Out of Here. I especially love Get Me Out of Here. Paul has always loved doing country/folk type songs and that one sounds like an old country song that's been around for ever, and he sings it with such amusement.<br /><br />It's the diversity of the tracks that make the album so strong. Paul keeps changing directions, track after track. And it's the energy that the album captures -- modern sounding but not TOO modern sounding -- that makes this a pleasure to listen to from start to finish.<br /><br />One word of warning: This is Paul singing with his 71-year-old voice. It's not his 1967 voice or his 1977 voice or even his 1997 voice. Whether you like his \\"old-man\\" voice is a matter of personal preference. I enjoy hearing what he can do with his voice as it is now. I have no illusions that he sings like he did at 30. But if you're one of those people who can't stand the thought of Paul getting old, and sounding anything but like he did with the Beatles, this album ain't for you. However, if you're interested in hearing what a genius can offer at 71, just when you thought all his tricks had been revealed, you're going to be pleasantly surprised.
1476727651|5.0|Amazing....everything I expected. I waited a long time for this book to be released. Got it on the first day, and didn't loved every page
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a fun read. It was not like the movie at all but still very entertaining. I would recommend it to anybody who likes zombie/apocalyptic books.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Awesome. Outright information and communication. With daily devotion being shared to friends and love ones. And up to date happenings from people around.
B000002UJQ|5.0|They have a few cool tunes on other albums but nothing like this! Money well spent. Can't go wrong. It actually tells a story! Enjoy!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I just completed watching fifth season, sad because this is by far the best show I have ever watched. Will l Probably go back to season one and start all over.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|A fascinating book with twists and turns that was difficult to put down.  A very different storyline to Eat Pray Love, with amazing attention to detail
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm not a gamer by ANY means. I don't have games on my cell phone and I mostly use my Kindle for web surfing and book reading. Occasionally some movie & TV show watching will occur, but for the most part that's the only time I'm on my kindle. BUT This is one of the random games I have downloaded on my Kindle for those times when I'm waiting extensively somewhere for something or someone in a place that offers no WiFi. If I'm not currently consumed by a book this game comes in real handy. It's makes waiting seem-less and enjoyable. The time just flies by...no pun intended.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 6 times usually around Halloween.  I am a fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.  The movie is extremely visually appealing and both Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt did a great job in the lead vampire roles.  Storyline stays close to the book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I had never heard of the Orphan Train and would love to learn more. Great read.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I use this app everyday and it is so helpful. I only got it because it was free at he time but if I knew it was as good as it is I would have payed the 2 dollars.
B004JQN364|5.0|This figure is masterfully detailed down to the very last scale, I bought him along with the tiger mutant and they really look like they are squaring off and going to come alive on my table top! The weapons seem like you might be able to get the free of the claw and holster but its pretty tight and I didn't want to break the weapons. I definitely recommend this to anyone! Papo does not disappoint!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever it keeps me going it's lots of fun and its about damn time they created this app for Kindle.. but for real Its a really good game download it and try it for your self.
B00DGABUIC|5.0|Awesome quality figurine, he's so small and adorable, a must have for any who loved the movie or who just love dragons! I'm debating on actually buying several more for gifts!
1401922732|5.0|I bought three sets of cards and this set by far is the one that speaks to me the most.  I feel that they are postive and have helped me look at life in a wonderful way giving me postive guidance and reaffirming my choices.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|My six year old son's favorite movie. He has been watching this movie since he was three years old. Very entertaining. I totally recommend this film.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I bought this book because of the many good reviews it had. (If that many people liked it, it's a good bet that it at least doesn't suck). The author did an excellent job showing the complexity and simplicity of human emotions, and the strength required to be a mother. Very good read.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show. Gritty, realistic, yet charming in its own way. Has heart. Once you see the pilot you want to keep on watching.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Leonardo<br />Tis was and will be one of the best movies around for years if he keeps it up.<br /> The man is a a classic performer and I truly enjoyed the entire series.............<br />  After all a little mafia and crime never has hurt the American reputation it has garnered over the years lol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad it's finally going to be on my Kindle Fire HD. It's hard to see on my iPhone and I am so in love with this app and none of the wannabes can be a substitute. Have fun and enjoy its great graphics!!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I saw the Broadway show and bought the soundtrack, which I like.  However, I thought this movie soundtrack was better.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use, and seems to do the job with little effort.  It alerts you if you haven t cleaned in a while.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|I loved the moved, but was disappointed with the constant skips in the DVD itself -- especially during the songs in the movie.
B00BDNCXTE|5.0|This show is pure soul!  The Garcia band is on fire.  You will not be disappointed! The year 1980 was for Garcia, is what 1977 was for the Dead.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Once you get past the porn the books are a very good soap opera character study/love story. Very relatable characters and situations.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this continuation of The Shining. It was great to revisit with Dan, even with all his grown up vises. I thought the plot was really well thought out, but I have become used to that with Stephen King. The twists will keep you reading until the end and still looking for more.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It was OK...certainly an interesting idea..fast spreading, fast moving zombies...every time a shot came up where we might see some blood and gore they cut the scene or stop panning down...that's a good thing in my book, too much blood and guts isn't necessary...I'm personally more interested in the start of the outbreak rather than how they end it...I do have issue with the premise that (SPOILER ALERT) zombies can sense terminal illness...give me a break, zombies can only sense fresh brains...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is the easiest method to watch shows from Netfix on a big screen.  Never have problems with streaming anymore. It was easy to install too. Great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that kindle finally got this.. been waiting and waiting for it to come.. now I can't stop playing..
B00FGEO9NE|5.0|Homeland remains brilliant and unforgettable for me. I cannot say enough about it. From the writing to the directing to acting, it is seamless and unforgettable. We look forward to every new episode - it's full of surprises and I really like the complexities of the protagonist, Carrie.<br /><br />I seldom watch television, but I absolutely love this show.
B000MDJH9A|3.0|A well made movie about the sad reality that is a part of the Jamerican Experince. God help us not to create anymore monsters!
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|I love the insight into another culture while being entertained in a great story.  I plan to read the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is so fun but i wish we wont have to buy stuff in real life . i wish it was just buying stuff in fake life
0375703764|4.0|I am really enjoying this book so far. It has a really unique writing style that's pretty complex. I know  this one is going to take me a while if I read it word for word because it includes a huge amount of footnotes and clippings. Sometimes I find them unnecessary and off topic, but I still enjoy them. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but if you're looking for a long read that you can pick up when you're not busy this is definitely for you.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Right now Brandon Sanderson could write a teen romance novel starring vampires and I'd read it. He is, without doubt, the most creative fantasy writer of his generation and quite possibly (consider the diversity of his work/worlds) of any generation.
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|Storyline was well written and moved seamlessly. The country side scenery was beautiful.<br />Highly recommended as a movie night film.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great read and nice follow up to the Shining. I wonder how much of the story relates to Stephen King's personal life challenges? Will make a great movie!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This DVD box set is a gift for my husband, who is a big fan of Columbo.  He has complained that the many tv channels have not been showing the reruns ofthis classic series, so he'll be very surprised to receive this set.
B007L24T52|5.0|A most consistent writer and I have read most of his books.  I can recommend it to most of my friends who seem to appreciate his books too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this app it is incredibly fun and very good and if you do thanks and yeah get the app and play it every day and year now buy or die.
1426209584|5.0|Most wonderful photographs of all the birds.  A book I have wanted for a long time. Will take my time to finish reading it.
B00138H5PQ|5.0|FIONA has really evolved with her poetry and music. She OS her pena perdón and I apreciate that. This particular album IS one of My favorites. She IS candid as always her music sounds like blues, rock, and poetic folk.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|BUT then it gets easier once you figure out how NOT to flip over! Very intense! Addicting as well! I enjoy playing this game, keeps me on edge!
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|Been playin this for 7 months n im bored cause it takes too long to get enough coins to buy land and level up. Its also pretty hard to get rubies without spending actual cash. Otherwise it was fun for awhile
B00DHRLK84|1.0|I did not realize it was a zombie mover, if I had I would not of ordered it. My fault.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Books like this are why I fell in love with Stephen King's writing as a teen.  I'm much older than that now, but the love affair still continues.  This book picks up with Danny Torrance as an adult, but it feels like you never left him.  I can't say that you would get as much out of this book if you haven't read The Shining.  I'm not going to rehash the story, there are plenty of other reviews that do that.  Just let me say that if you enjoy a good scare but not &#34;too&#34; scary, you'll love it!
0743289692|5.0|This book surprise me! It's tells of a young woman growing up in the Muslim faith and all the rules and how they affect her growing up. Part of it as for older teen reading, adult. But it's a true story how this woman wants a better life and questions her faith. It's well written, yet flows easy. I start reading and my eyes can't move fast enough to the next page!! It is a powerful book and very frank. It opened my eyes about how a lot of people live in the world. It came fast and though it was a used book,,,it is almost like new.  I'm happy with this book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has a great narrative, and Cline is a good writer. But what made this book great was that it was woven together with the pop culture of my childhood. It's a must read for geeks like me who grew up in the 80s.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Wonderful story ..... Gives the reader a good sense of life in Afghanistan! Character development is good. Great book for book club discussions!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I had no idea that there was an actual train that took thousand of children out to the midwest to be adopted against their will all those years ago. basically the people who adopted the boys wanted them for free back breaking farm labor and the girls for servants I am sure  that they didn't have to pay, or for free labor in their small businesses. I am sure  some were welcomed and loved, but overall it was a sad time in America's history. Some of the children were snatched off the streets by the police and given over to this social service that sent them out there.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is so classic Stephen King.  I was hooked from the first page.  He's always been my favorite author.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I'm always drawn to singer-songwriters who offer great lyrics and beautiful melodies. Don't get me wrong- I like a nice piece of bubblegum every now and then, but albums like this one are the bulk of my collection, and the ones who get the most play. Mike Rosenberg has a unique voice, both literally and figuratively, and I can't rate it high enough. The first song I heard from him was 'Circles', and it remains my favorite for its delicate hook and poignant words, but other songs like 'Life's For the Living' and 'Feather on the Clyde' are equally as impressive. There are a few more lighthearted tracks, including a bar sing-along about hating things like taking a dump in a port-a-potty (how's that for a wide range of topics?) so the whole album isn't pensive and moody. Once again- stellar work.
B00A2H9X6I|3.0|In November 1976, the Stephen King adapted horror flick, Carrie - starring Sissy Spacek, took the box office by storm.  If you look at the box office returns for the film today, they are by no means impressive as the film only earned $33.8 million.  However, don't forget that was back in 1976, and still plenty enough to thrust Carrie towards the top of the list of the highest grossing films of the year.  Not only was Carrie a commercial success, it was also highly praised by fans and critics, and even today is regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made.  You know what that means, right?  It means it was only a matter of time before the studio decided it was time for a remake.  Obviously, remakes are a natural occurrence these days and rarely live up to the originals - especially in the horror genre.  But, Carrie might just be the exception to the rule.<br /><br />Directed by Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don't Cry, Stop-Loss), Carrie stars Chloë Grace Moretz as Carrie White, a gifted teenage outcast that discovers she has the ability to move objects with her mind.  After an embarrassing incident in the girl's shower room, fellow classmate, Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) attempts to make amends by convincing her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort), to take Carrie to the prom.  However, another fellow classmate, Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) is suspended from prom over the shower incident, prompting her to seek revenge against Carrie - in front of everyone at the dance.  Against the wishes of her highly religious mother, Margaret (Julianne Moore), Carrie decides to attend the dance, leading to the most life changing moment in Carrie's life.  Judy Greer, Alex Russell, and Barry Shabaka Henley also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />To simply say this film is bad because it's nothing more than a repeat of the original is just flat out stupid.  In fact, it's fair to say that this Carrie remake is executed smoother than the original.  Unlike the poor re-imagining of horror classics, like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, Carrie sticks to the same storyline as the original - with slight variations and welcome additions.  If anything, the modifications and additions by screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen make this story even stronger than the original.  For instance, viewers never knew the definite fate of Tommy Ross in the original, so that question is answered for us.  For reasons beyond comprehension, Tommy and Carrie kiss on multiple occasions in the original, even though he's supposedly dating Sue, which is addressed and cleaned-up in the new version.  And finally, a slight elaboration about Carrie's powers is briefly mentioned when she states there are more people in the world like her - a small fact that will no doubt lead to possible sequels.<br /><br />While I'm personally a fan of Chloë Grace Moretz's acting, largely for her strong portrayal of Hit-Girl in the Kick-Ass films, she's not exactly the best choice for Carrie White.  Sissy Spacek had a much more mysterious, often creepy vibe surrounding her character.  Moretz doesn't feel like an outcast in this film - quite the opposite in fact, to the extent that she could easily be a member of the \\"in\\" crowd if she would simply loosen up and talk more.  Spacek's version felt like an outcast, clearly struggling to maintain control of the inner hatred that was just looking for an excuse to be unleashed.  Moretz's version just doesn't provide that same inner turmoil.  Even though Moretz is more age appropriate for the role (16 years old), she doesn't seem angry enough.  If anything, she appears to be too happy for her own good.  Even the climactic showdown at the dance feels more like an overreaction than a full-blown emotional meltdown.  In any event, I guess we should all be happy Moretz was cast instead of the previously rumored Lindsay Lohan.  That surely would have been an onscreen and off-screen disaster of Carrie-like proportions.<br /><br />The supporting cast is mainly lackluster and hardly worth mentioning, but as usual, Julianne Moore stands out (as always) - in the role of Carrie's mother, Margaret White.  In all honesty, has Moore even given a bad performance in her life?  Regardless, she really (forgive the baseball metaphor) knocks this character out of the park.  She's doesn't necessarily appear to be as overly religious as Piper Laurie's portrayal - at least in terms of preaching, but is much more harmful to herself in the name of God.  On several occasions, Moore appears to be on the verge of insanity, especially in one scene where she is beating her head against the wall and also in another scene where she is purposely stabbing herself in the leg.  In a perfect world, Moore's depiction of the character would star alongside Sissy Spacek's portrayal of Carrie.  Now that would actually be the pairing from supernatural Hell.<br /><br />Overall, Carrie is an enjoyable remake that will bring this masterful story to a new generation.  Obviously, this film is targeted towards a younger film audience, with an emphasis on horror.  Although, horror fans are sure to be disappointed with this effort, since it doesn't provide for one outstanding scare and will likely seem boring in comparison to modern horror flicks, like The Conjuring and Insidious.  At times, this story feels sadly outdated, which is what made the original film popular in the first place.  Sure, this new film cleans up a bunch of small nuances that felt out of place in the 1976 version.  On the other hand, there's no such thing as a perfect film and the die-hard lovers of the original won't like the fact that some things are changed (although many lines are still the same) - even if they do make more sense.  For me, this reworked story is much cleaner and more elaborate, making for a better film experience, especially if you've never seen the original.  Still, it's impossible to give a remake a score that's any higher than average.  After all, it's really nothing more than a blatant copy.<br /><br />GRADE: C<br />FNDNreview.comhe supporting cast is mainly lackluster and hardly worth mentioning, but as usual, Julianne Moore stands out (as always) - in the role of Carrie's mother, Margaret White.

B0063M22QO|5.0|This game keeps my interest, New tiles keep coming into play, New puzzles and lots to watch for. I played the game with tiles when I was younger and what I didn't like was setting up the board, now I just hit play and go.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|He doesn't put a foot wrong with music! Quite different from his other albums, but amazing nevertheless! All of me and made love is my fav
B003XT60KO|5.0|Most of our public schools today are not teaching basic economics.  The little that is taught is mostly Keynesian economics indoctrination.  This book considers the other side of the story and presents a logical case for free markets.<br /><br />I believe it should be mandatory reading for all high schools students.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Fun game. Different from Tetris. It is very easy to play this game nonstop for a long period of time. It can be both easy and challenging.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|First let me say that this novel is a real page turner.  Lee's first work succeeds in producing enough suspenseful cliffhangers to prompt the reader through the novel.  The characters are fairly well developed and the varying plot lines weave together nicely. Nonetheless, the reader must endure a very high degree of suspension of reality.  Several situations that Reacher finds himself in are a bit contrived to say the least (eg. the main premise of the book: a random bus stop into the town his brother's murder the night before?...).  The excessive, gory detail of violence and sexually explicit content at times borders on obscene and does nothing to advance the plot.  Overall I would say that the book is only passable for this genre given you know what your are getting into as a reader.
B00DU74U74|3.0|Having read the book, I was hard pressed to see how they were going to make the movie.  80% of the book is dialogue between Melany and Wanderer inside Melany's head.  The movie does a pretty good job and is fairly true to the book.  I REALLY disliked who they picked for the body near the end of the movie (you'll understand if you have read the book or watch the movie); the actress they picked looked odd and did not fit the reasoning in the book whatsoever.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such and amazing show, would recommend over and over. I especially love the era. Great acting, and filmed in an absolutely beautiful location.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I started watching the mentalist a few months ago and now I'm hooked! Love this series, very funny and not grewsome!
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I think Kevin Spacey always brings his A game, which you have to respect.  The story is interesting, the characters are twisted in twisted ways; but after watching half of the first season, I found myself kind of depressed from its message...so I stopped watching it.
0399246665|4.0|These books are cute, I don't necessarily like how they are cut in half so that you &#34;search&#34; for the matching items but I do like the eric carle brand and hopefully my little guy will have fun with them!
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|I mainly watch these type of movies to see what's new in animation.  I applaud the creative attempt, but this one did not work for me, as the look and feel never struck a nerve; but I will admit that by the end of the movie I did find myself liking most of the characters.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun to play whenever, easy to use and navigate, very addicting game to say the least. Would most definitely download.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I don't dislike it, and it is a slightly different twist on the whole zombie theme, so that's good.  But I guess I never fully bought in to Brad PItt's character...being the reluctant hero.
140006922X|4.0|I'm still reading the book and enjoying it immensely.  I'm reading this for my book club but am glad I was forced to buy it because I'm loving all the historical detail.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I find myself enjoying E-Squared in a completely different way than most books.  It is filled with energy experiments that actually work!  The book is based on the premise of the law of attraction.  But, unlike other books that simply tell you about it, E-Squared shows you and gives you the tools to make the law operational in your life.  An example is the &#34;Jenny Craig Experiment&#34; in the book.  You are given instructions to use over a 3-day period that can bring the loss of at least 1 pound.  I lost 4.2 pounds in the 3 days, using this experiment!  And that is only one example.<br /><br />The book is entertaining and a fast read.  I find myself going back over some of the experiments for the enjoyment of it.  I highly recommend Pam Grout's E-Squared.  This book can do more to open minds than anything else I have come across.  Thank you, Pam Grout!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Been reading King's work since I was 10 and this one is just another great to add into my collection for my kids someday.
B006CHML4I|4.0|It was gift for my nephew who is in college.  It suited his taste and color was also a good one.  In all I think my nephew appreciated the gift!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I found this while seeking something to fill the gap between books 5 & 6 of Game of Thrones, so this lacked something at first; mostly in the depth of characters and believability of some of their conversation. However, that was soon left behind by an intricate new world being unfolded in front of me. This book is entertaining, engaging and, as I write this, I am waiting for A Wise Man's Fear to download. Very good read - you won't be disappointed.
B000669GAI|5.0|I think it gives a good view on there work untill 2003. Known an some less known songs mixed together in 2 cd's. 2 hours of rock from Seattle. Just sit down and enjoy!
B000I0XLYO|5.0|In my humble opinion, one of the cutest, most hilarious comedies ever. I would love Ben Stiller to do another harmless (unless of course you are a ridiculously good looking male model) but hilariously funny film like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Your reputation as creators for candy crush is very important to us. Dont ever leave us hungry and thirsty for this app again, ok. I've been waiting forever for this app. I love this game. Stay close to us and don't ever let us go.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Interesting thought provoking exercises.  The author uses interesting text to bring the exercise to mind.  There was a good progression from one exercise to the next.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I recommend this book to all! Well written and full of events to keep the reader in suspense. Thank you Anne, for letting us in!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Loving it so far! It's challenging but still able to win levels that's all you can ask for out of a free app
B00004W50T|5.0|Love it!  The collaboration of these five talented men is outstanding.  These songs made them famous! The oldies but goodies!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|If you like knocking things down and racing to get miles. You will love this game has great features and a great penguin that turns invincible to all things. But one thing you git to make sure not to crash or fall in the w as water,ice and fences. But differently get app
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|I really enjoyed the Shinning and sometimes sequels can be a bit disappointing but this was fantastic. It was great to have some continuation of Danny's relationship with Dick O'Hallaran. I won't say too much as &#34;spoilers&#34;. A very well put together story. A must read for Mr King's fans.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|I like the old English settings and situations.  A couple of the characters weren't quite in character, but still worked well in the story.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|In book two of the Dwellers of Ahwahnee series, author Sheryl Seal continues to skillfully build a wonderful world of fascinating characters and beautiful landscapes. It's easy to get lost in the world that Seal creates and you may find yourself wishing you could go there and be one of the characters. New characters are introduced who play important roles as the story progresses including Grey Wolf's sisters.<br /><br />This story is the most sincere romance I have ever read. The author has a gift for describing what people are feeling in the most real way. The romantic passages are tender and passionate without ever seeming overly done or too syrupy. \\"The promises of tomorrow were in her eyes.\\" That is one of the many romantic thoughts in this beautifully described romance set in the magical setting of Native American mysticism.<br /><br />Author Sheryl Seal has a poetic way of writing which is sincere, unique and wonderful. The story is peppered with amazingly thoughtful passages and I found myself going back and re-reading them and highlighting them so I could go back and read them again. Here is one of my favorites, spoken by Oria to her grandmother while she is wondering if she will ever see her beloved Grey Wolf again: \\"Seriously grandmother, I think the biggest coward in the world, is the man who awakens a woman's love with no intention of loving her.\\"<br /><br />But there is a lot more going on in book two than beautiful and sexy romance. In Beyond Oria Falls, we actually get to see the terrifying Ala in her real form as she wreaks havoc and destruction upon the peaceful people of Ahwahnee.<br /><br />I think Beyond Oria Falls is a bit more of a cliff hanger than Beyond Bridalveil Fall and when you read this wonderful fantasy you will probably be as excited as I am about encouraging author Sheryl Seal to continue on with a third volume. I wish I could tell you more about the finale in book two and why I anticipate the next volume, but you will need to read it for yourself. I highly recommend this amazing 5-star book.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|good sci-fi classic would recommend to anyone who likes these movies pass the popcorn please, thanks Oh I'll have a coke
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I was really happy to play this game until I got to one level and can not figure it out at all
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Well done on cast and would recommend to anyone who likes these stars pass the popcorn please, thanks Oh I'll have a coke
0761172726|5.0|This is a great calendar for the home. It's built more like a graph in that you fill in the dates and information for only those people in your family that are involved in that event. My kids write their names (in order of birth) and fill in their own dance times and busy days. I can keep track of who goes where and when they need to be there. We all joke that Dad is the busiest. But he's a coach and I can write his home and away games, plan things when he's out of town and not miss out on anything. We do have to put the information into our cell phones to keep us on track when were not home though.
0446672653|3.0|Dr. Weiss has an engaging style but Many Lives, Many Masters is the most compelling of his books, in my opinion.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This long and utterly fantastic read had me excitedly turning each page.  I couldn't have enough of the character Kaladin.  The unique way Sanderson writes his books will have me buying many more in the future.

0316322407|5.0|Every generation of mankind has its own redeemer, avatar, sage, or messiah. Listening to 16-year old Malala, there is no doubt she is the gift sent to redeem her generation. She articulates wisdom that many adults are incapable of imagination. Thanks to the British for saving her life.
B00AEFYWDC|4.0|This movie is mostly overlooked. There are many plot twists in this movie. The ending will surprise you. Great performances by Richard Gere and Edward Norton<br /><br />N.E.C.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great cast, good screen writing, great follow through of Star Trek 2009. I did expect more from it, but I was not disappointed. Could have been better for those of us who love Star Trek, but able to stand on it's own!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game goes on and on. There are ways of earning money and gems but I found some required tools and stuff are expensive. So far I've not had to purchase coin or gem. More later.......
B000W8HC8I|1.0|This is a rare instance that the movie might be better than the book.  I cannot imagine the movie sucking more than this book.  This book was too long, too embelished, too many exaggerated antics.  I guess if you were stoned on  &#34;ludes&#34; this might seem insanely funny and entertaining, but unfortunately, I was on a cross country plane straight as an arrow.  It read like one long drunk story, I guess you had to be there.......
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Love Charlie Hunnam<br /><br />He is such a great actor in this movie. Great to see that he can play different characters<br />aside from Sons of Anarchy. Good story line, full of action and adventure.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed tnis book very much. Always wondered what happened to Danny after the Shining. I will never look at an RV park the same way ever again.
B001974DG0|5.0|I loved this book! If you are an animal lover, it is a must read!If you are not a big fan of animals, you will be after reading this book!
1419705644|5.0|This book is HILARIOUS! And it's interactive!: there's a flip-book animation on the corners, a page written backwards so you have to read it in a mirror, and other fun stuff! And there are some pages that take you by surprise, like the guy who was trapped in the book! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, well spent money!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. I play it daily.<br />Thanks Mobility Ware for a great game and a daily challenge while waiting for my schedule to catch up to my calendar.
1849905789|5.0|This Book I felt was great having watched the video series first and thinking it a very good series the book was a great follow up to the video series of Indian cooking and curries provide much greater detail with the actual cook process :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am not good at most games but this one is easy and super fun! I am actually addicted! I mean who doesn't like playing with minions!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is along the lines of Abraham Hicks and it is a MUST READ for anyone who questions coincidence or even their religion. I heard about this book from a friend and I'm very glad I got it. I now recommend it to everyone I meet!
B00785P2QC|5.0|THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR WHEN YOU ARE PASSING TIME. IT ALSO KEEPS WHEN YOUR NOT PLAYING. THAT'S A PLUS. It keeps making you money.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's cool and the setup is easy. If you only want to watch YouTube or Netflix (or Hulu now?). When I first put this in I wanted to stream movies from my PC. I already use PS3 Media Server which works well for most devices in my house. I bought this because of a new TV I have that is not any type of smart TV. When I plugged it in and got my browser streaming on the TV from my PC I was very happy. I quickly found out that not all video types are supported. It seems to play mp4 fine if you have a lot of those. I have MKV's mostly so 99% of the movies I had would not pass audio. After many attempts at getting this to work with different players through Chrome (VLC, Divx, etc.), I finally gave up. This is probably more of an issue with the Chrome browser at this point and it's inability to work with some audio streams. What did finally end up working was Plex. Plex is nice because it has its own web page which you can open in Chrome and it forces Chrome to use its player. Then you can cast that from Chrome which works and you can pick audio language and such. Okay problem solved right? Not quite. My movies are mostly 1080p. Now although the Chromecast can get 1080p (I believe), this is only through apps like YouTube and such. Chrome browser will only cast 720p. Boooo.<br /><br />Another really important thing is the fact that Chromecast requires wifi. It's not totally clear that this device only works on a wifi connection. I actually had to buy a wifi dongle for my hard-wired PC. Don't get me wrong, I needed it, but it was unexpected. I thought that if I could stream other stuff from my PC to devices on my wireless network then this would work as well. I was wrong.<br /><br />Anyways I give Chrome browser 1 star for having such a huge job in this and failing miserably. I'm giving Chromecast 3 stars because of its lack of streaming apps like Fling (which was awesome and then taken away). I also think it should be more obvious when purchasing Chromecast of these shortcomings.<br /><br />I can't wait for new apps that let me stream local media more easily. It's still a great device and I'm not upset that I bought one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app is very quick and easy. It has lots of versions to pick from to allow you to do a lot more research in a very quick ammount of time.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this read. Like all his books it was finished in under a week, and I cannot wait for the next installment of this series or the Stormlight Archives.
B0086700CM|5.0|Your classic game of running away after stealing a precious artefact from a tribe of monkey people. I discovered how to duck the hard way. Get it 'hard way' I repeatedly hit my head? No, it wasn't't that funny anyway.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I truly enjoyed playing this problem solving game. It was neither too difficult nor too easy! The puzzles were fun and the lab work was logical. The hidden objects are visible if you look - not obscured as in some games. The story was actually intriguing and the dialog didn't ramble on which was refreshing!  I liked this game a lot and will play it again and again. Thanks to those who created it! Keep them coming!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I was looking for a microsoft word, but this is almost as cool. You can personalize each note book cover and give it a title. Like a word document.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Great show! If your into sci fiction and like jj abram style twists this is for you! Actors are great and the story holds well. Some loop holes but not a big deal

B008CX2A2I|1.0|This does not work on 2011 model receivers.  It only works with 2012 models...<br />I have a TX-NR-809 which is 2011 model year.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is a detailed and chilling accounting of nuclear weapons in the US.  Schlosser gives an engrossing look at how the US has attempted to control its nuclear weapons.  Of note are the many accidents involving weapons including a blow by blow account of the explosion of a Titan II missile and its nine megaton warhead.  I found the book interesting from both a policy perspective and as a chronicle of the technology of the cold war.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really just needed a simple calculator feature for my kindle fire. Haven't had any problems. Works great and can't beat the price (free!) either.
B00AFEY354|4.0|Ezra Miller is the best thing in this movie, but Emma Watson and Logan Lerman are also quite good. After seeing Emma in the Harry Potter movies, it's amazing to hear her in this without a trace of that British accent that's become so familiar. Ezra Miller is very funny as Patrick, and Logan Lerman does a good job as Charlie. The movie is much better than the title would suggest.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A wonderful up listing story with a great message. Kindness ... We should all strive to spread more kindness! Absolutely loved it!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|The cast is great, but Judd Nelson steals the show. He is hilarious as the rebellious non-conformist teen, yet he also brings a vulnerability to the role that makes his character real and sympathetic. The other cast members are very good. This movie is about character development. No car chases, no violence. But very funny and heartfelt. A tremendous movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a great game but I think it's a little hard to collect the coins, it didn't move fast enough when I tilt it and I have to tilt it really far, then if I want to turn while it's tilted I slide instead<br /><br />Other wise pure awesome
B0084IG8TM|5.0|In the 2nd disc, there's a feature about the casting of this movie, and the casting director comments that Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence's character) is the key--&#34;if you get that wrong, you can't recover.&#34; They got it right, and then some. Jennifer Lawrence is simply spectacular. She can say more with a facial expression than most actors can with 1,000 words. Woody Harrelson is surprisingly good as Haymitch, Katniss' mentor, and the rest of the cast is also very strong. While the movie sticks very close to the storyline of the book, it also makes a few improvements, such as taking us behind the scenes of the &#34;arena&#34; to show us the Gamemaker pulling strings, or letting us listen in on the conversations between the Seneca Crane and President Snow. Many memorable scenes, most of them involving Jennifer Lawrence. I'm looking forward to the next movie now.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Since I am a big fan of Mr King, I always expect to be surprised.  This book really hit the button.  It was great to follow up with some of the characters from The Shining.  I loved that the &#34;good guys&#34; won.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a long time Constant Reader, I could not have been more thrilled to finally get a chance to reconnect with Danny Torrence. I always knew his life would be difficult (how could it not be?) but was quite satisfied with how he turned out in the end. Abra is an amazing, comforting presence in Dan's life and a strong character in her own right. Even the characters of Momo, Dr. John, and Billy were brought to life and were bright spots in an otherwise dark tale.  The evil Rose and her crew of nasties were the dark, terrifying aspects of this novel. As a reader of King novels and not a real fan of the movies, I appreciate the continuity of the tale which began in &#34;The Shining&#34;.  Potential readers of this novel need not fear that they will be lost if they have not read &#34;The Shining&#34;. King brings the old hotel to life as well as those horrors cluttering Dan's mind. Dan Torrence was and always will be one of my favorite King characters. Once again,Stephen King does not fail to deliver
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Loved the simplicity and honesty of this magical story. It is so important in these times of stress and massive social media, that we remember that animals can bring love and  unselfish , unconditional love into our lives and the true meaning of life beyond all the superficial material stuff.  I'm sure everyone who gets to know James and Bob wish them a great life together.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this product since my Roku didn't offer YouTube channel. The experience wasn't bad . The setup was easy and the wifi speed was fast. But it should be along with phones or laptops as the product name implies. I expect a lot of improvements.
B000O599ZS|5.0|This movie is John Ford's version of Cynthia Ann Parker's kidnapping in early Texas history by the Comanches.  It is a great teaching aide for students in my Texas History class.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. I recommend it all ages for girls. The horses  look so real. I love to play the app.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book brought me back to my favorite Stephen King novels of the past. Fully developed story - good read.
B000OJFV4C|3.0|It's always interesting to see how history in film.  Henry was quite unstable and easily influenced. There is a reason for the head of the church, and just because he was infatuated by Ann he wanted his assigned people to make laws in his favor.  Don’t we all wish life was as such? But entertaining all the same.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I absolutely loved The Shining and when I read that Stephen King was writing, what I guess could be called a sequel, I knew I had to get it!  I loved the references to The Shining, the resurrection of Hallorhann.  His depictions of Wal-mart Americans are so real and unreal!  The afterward gives the reader some insight into the genius writer and his own demons.  I had no doubt that he would not disappoint and Doctor Sleep did not.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|People would ask me how do you like your kindle, I would say, it's cool, I just can't get candy crush....NOW I CAN!!!!!! Having my favorite game of all time completes kindle fire as my best tablet ever....my husband and my mom has on as well....all smiles over here!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I first read the preview chapter that had been posted on Brandon Sanderson's Facebook page.  As soon as I completed the preview chapter I immediately preordered the book.  Brandon Sanderson does not disappoint.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|One of the absolute best books a teenager, or anyone, could ever read. This book is gripping, it pushes you to your limits, and it captures your heart. Jay Asher has found an amazing and different way to portray suicide - through Hannah's voice, literally. You fall in love with Hannah and Clay's personalities immediately and the hurt that Hannah goes through is so relatable for teenagers. Absolutely recommend this. One of my all time favorites that I could read again and again.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good book still reading but it will get more stars im sure when I get done. I wiil always read and like stephen King
1591845831|5.0|Most of the books on self development are worth to read. Same can be said about this book. I've found many fascinating ideas about life and career, though I don't feel inspired to build a company that will enchant people. Maybe it's my problem only, but still written in somewhat calm not inspiring style if somebody can consider it as a disadvantage. But anyway I am giving it 5 stars.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Take out the sex and give it to 13 year old girls to read.  I normally persevere with bad book and movies just in case there's an improvement - Here I gave up!
B0091REZMW|2.0|Energy runs out too fast, and you have to buy bullets to enter certain rooms. Difficult tonget diamonds. Very disappointed.@
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|This is a fun game.  I like hidden object games, it makes me feel like I accomplish something when I find it.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|One great steal.....get it while it's the free AOTD !<br />This is one of the best games I've played on my tablet....it's not just another kids game, in fact some of the later levels provided quite a challenge trying to get three stars.<br />I'm really hoping for a sequel or an update with new levels .....really this is a great little game .....give it a try you won't be sorry :)
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I grew up on all kinds of music, but my favorite is Bluegrass.<br />It is so evocative of the early mountain music and the traditional<br />chords of the Scots and Irish. If you like \\"old fashioned\\" country this<br />is the CD for you.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Stefany Robles and the most popular stories about how much you have any questions or comments vote for the same thing as the other side of the a set equipped with the other Wed Jan and the most thing with the other side effects and the most p to D.C.and fifth avenue in the other side of the state
0060523794|4.0|It is exactly what it is advertised to be. You will understand IBM and what it went through in the 1990s. Don't expect it to be a lesson in turnarounds - Big Blue is very unique in its culture, structure, and business.
159514188X|5.0|I am really excited to read this book it came is grey condition and I received it super fast I love it awesome
B0037NB6QE|4.0|Nice, light read.  Sometimes slightly predictable; however, the characters are well developed and easy to like.  Great little pause from reality.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Reminds me of the old (90s) lemmings game. Feels slower than lemmings :-)<br />Nice graphics. Nice free app of the day
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Excellent lyrics, soulful sound, and good beats. I would definitely recommend this album. A unique offering in a sea of clones!
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|Great story. Great acting spectacular sets and costumed. Action continuously through the movie. 3D well done without being too dizzying.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|On time! Perfect Condition, great service! Very satisfied as a costumer. No more to add, excellent! I would strongly recommend!
0316219266|4.0|Despite some inherent challenges this was a very readable account of the Amazon story to-date....the book has some interesting 'you-are-there' anecdotes, offers a deeper look at the company's founding (and founder) & serves as a good review of the internet boom and bust (and boom?)....while not exactly an authorized account, the book is far richer and has more first person insights than earlier attempts (One-Click, Get Big Fast, Amazonia).<br /><br />My primary quibble with the book relates to the admittedly broad scope before it....Amazon is an amazingly complex beast, and it only becomes more so with each passing year....so it's a challenge for any author to decide what to focus on and to what level of depth....I think for the most part Stone does an admirable job, but the book does feel a bit disjointed at times as it bounds from topic to topic....I'm not sure that's avoidable if you want to keep the telling to a reasonable length and cover the complete history of the Company....but i do wonder if the topic at hand wouldn't ultimately benefit from a multi-volume effort focusing on different time periods and/or topics....similar to Robert Caro's LBJ series.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|this album proves that the more you practice your instrument, the easier it is to create a masterpiece.  great album.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|There was no way I would have figured out what the secret was until it was disclosed. Well writtten book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great for when your board . It is addictive I can't stop playing it.<br />This game is so fun and great for little kids
B00EZZ9W3C|5.0|I recently discovered GP a few weeks ago... I immediately purchased album #2 \\"Be Good\\"... I fell in love with it.  I immediately purchased album #1 \\"Water\\".  I fell in love with it.  I saw him live and was AMAZED at how much he sounded exactly like he did on the albums... it's rare in this day of studio one hit wonders... but this guy IS THEE TRUTH!!!  \\"Liquid Spirit\\" falls right in line with the expected excellence that came after his first two albums.  I have played songs from this album and others for a few of my friends and they purchased albums on the spot!  Treat yourself to the next greeatest singer you've never heard!  Your ears deserve it! ;-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app was fun and I really enjoyed  in I would suggest it to other people for long trips, and times when you get bored
B00CH3QLG0|5.0|The best house record of 2013, hands down! The vinyl version, included here, is the ideal way to listen to Disclosure, IMHO. Packaged nicely, played smoothly, packaging was as gorgeous as the tracks.
B001BR5NH6|1.0|It has too many adult themes and no restraint with the fowl and lewd language, definitely not suitable for children!<br /><br />From a quality production stand point, it's just way too old school.<br /><br />The special effects look SO cheesy and the way they portray how technology is suppose to work seems like a kindergartener came up with the concepts.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|once you get past all the sex, the story line is good.  read it in one nite. Now I am re-reading to see what I missed
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The author is obviously well versed in the subject BUT I didn't particularly appreciate his  continued use of stating that so much is false about what is known about historically about Jesus - It seems to me that more credit should have been given to what we have known for generations - The part that was frustrating to me was not being able to easily skip from one part of the book to another which is important during a discussion.  It is a book for those with a definite interest in the subject - b/c it was not an easy read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|was almost as good as the twlight books.  this group just had a great deal of sex but the story line was great
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King does it again with this story that is a continuation of the Shining.  It's a must read.  Bravo Stephen!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I read all three books, because I felt I had to. After the first book the other two seemed to really drag on and by the third book I felt I owed it to myself to find out how it all ends. If you can stand just reading the first one I recommend purchasing one at a time.
B006BQI1V2|3.0|The movie was ok but a bit of a let down after reading the book. My husband who does not like subtitles enjoyed the movie.
0553384775|5.0|If you are looking for a way to get in the mind of a stock guru and understand what the 80's and 90's were like for the rich then this would be a great book for you. The Leonardo Dicaprio movie is coming out very soon and I would highly recommend you read through this book beforehand because it is going to be hard for them to truly capture how Jordan Belfort lived like a king and had the tolerance of a rhino to get through his drunk binges and still be able to make millions of dollars in minutes of actual work throughout the day.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed the book and went out a looked for another by JoJo Moyes--now reading it andenoyoing this one also
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The characters were very real.  I felt the anguish of all involved in this book.  The ending was a surprise.  I expected something quite different.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|What a fun game. Not to hard, just enough to make u think of your next move. Very enjoyable to play.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|great game I love it its a lot of fun. Very easy to play I enjoy it and so does my grandiose.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think this gives some hope for long married couples who aren't communicating as well as before.  However, both parties have to participate.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel is great as usual.  I like him in just about everything he does.  Good storyline as well .Good acting!
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|As a teacher for 10 years I know this book is a winner! Well loved by children in my classrooms! I would recommend it from age 3-7! Wonderful book!!!!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This was a great read to me, I personally think this series will even outmatch the ever-loved mistborn series. It has plenty of action and the narrator is quite cunning as well. All in all: 5 stars.  The only downside is the sequel won't be released for quite a while..
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game i have ever played i love it and i think you will to everyone should get it
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Not what you expected, twist and turns.  A little over the top for SF in the movie itself, but it sure got your attention.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first got this game, I thought it was going to be hard, but the moment I started to play, it became clear to me that it was going to challenge me,and it did!<br /><br />My favorite part in this game is that I can jump and move around to avoid the subways!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I was so excited to get and read this book. I pre-ordered my Kindle version and waited with anticipation.  This was a good book.  It delivered the usual Stephen King richly detailed characters and supernatural connections.  The villains were frightening and stick with you long after finishing the book.  The kill scene was hard to take but that’s what makes Stephen King a master at this book writing thing.  It was, however, a bit depressing in that Danny, that sweet little boy from the Shinning, had become a raging alcoholic.  That and all the AA references just gave the book an overall tone sadness and hopelessness.  Still it is an interesting and worthwhile read.  I won't ever say no to a Stephen King read.  Much like Danny wouldn't turn down a drink before being saved by AA.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Like the slimness of the cover, I would have liked to have a different color but couldn't beat the price!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|He upgraded from 1 to this, because he was racking up so many points so easily.  Kids get this so quickly.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Watched this all thru the 80's and never thought I would see it again. Thanks Amazon for bringing it back!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved revisiting the world of THE SHINING! The story draws from what is familiar but is still new and thrilling!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Not sure I was crazy about the way this book ended.. but I couldn't put this book down. Gripping reading!
B000GWE44U|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's vision shows through in this snowed in thriller. Steven King has long trashed this version of his novel but he really lacks an ability to step back from his stories and allow someone else to film them properly. This movie is beautifully filmed as Stanley's other epics
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|The novel opens on 27 January 1866, in Hokitaka, a gold-rush town in New Zealand.  Walter Moody, who has recently arrived from Scotland with secrets of his own, enters the Crown Hotel smoking room and unwittingly interrupts a gathering of twelve men.  Nine of the men are European, two are Chinese, and one is Maori.<br /><br />Gradually, Walter Moody is told about three events that took place one night two weeks earlier.  A reclusive man named Crosbie Wells died in his cottage outside Hokitaka.  A young rich man named Emery Staines vanished, while Anna Wetherell an opium-addicted prostitute, who was with Staines earlier in the evening, is found comatose in the middle of the road.  Each of the twelve men is somehow involved.  Each of them has a piece of the story.  But can the pieces be fitted together to complete the story?  And what of the people outside of the smoking room?  What parts do they play?  Gold has been stolen - more than once.  Documents appear to tell contradictory stories.  Fact and illusion collide, opium and alcohol obfuscate.<br /><br />It's a complex story that unfolds over 12 parts.  The first part (12 chapters) occupies 360 pages, the twelfth (1 chapter) covers 4 pages.  Each part is smaller than its predecessor.  From full circle to sliver, there are many angles.  Few of the characters are straightforward; some are more devious than others.  It's not always easy to differentiate victim from villain.  The cast list at the front of the novel helps to make sense of the characters for the first 300 or so pages.  After that, if this book appeals to you, you'll find that the characters and their personalities become clear.<br /><br />I loved this novel and found it impossible to put down.  Just when I thought I'd made sense of it all and worked it out, a narrative shift or a differently presented perspective would have me question my earlier conclusions. For those interested in the astrological: each of the twelve men has been assigned a sign in the zodiac, six others embody planets, and the titular luminaries - Emery and Anna -are the sun and moon.  Those not interested in astrology need not be distracted by it: the story may refer to it and may be structured around it but it does not solely rely on it.  The different views of individuals owe as much to occupation and personality as they do to astrology.<br /><br />`But the doubled fish of Pisces, that mirrored womb of self and self-awareness, is an ourobouros of mind - both the will of fate, and the fated will - and the house of self-undoing is a prison built<br />by prisoners, airless, doorless and mortared from within.'<br /><br />As we pursue truth in Ms Patton's novel, there is plenty of action and adventure along the way.  Betrayal, infidelity, piracy and politics provide some of the flavour, as does the search for gold, romance and the tragedy of opium addiction. It's a hefty book at 832 pages, but I found it one of the most enjoyable reads I've tackled this year.  I was 300 pages in when it was announced as the winner of the 2013 Man Booker Prize.  I hope that winning this prize at such a comparatively young age is a boon rather than a burden for Ms Catton.<br /><br />`So I am to be the unraveller, Moody thought.  The detective: that is the role I am to play.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithzodiac, six others embody planets, and the titular luminaries - Emery and Anna -are the sun and moon.

B005KISGI0|5.0|Grandchild requested this because it contains R2D2 character. He never builds the actual model on the box, all LEGOS go in a bucket and miraculous creations appear. I don't think they even know what they are building when they start. You can't lose with a LEGO gift.
B00EV4EUT8|1.0|Why would any American pay for or view a movie, that stars a traitor and murderer such as &#34;Hanoi Jane&#34;?  The cast of liberals in this movie is without a doubt, what is wrong with America today.  Our servicemen and women deserve better.  I despise &#34;J. F.&#34; and any producer or director that would give her a role, or any actor that would share the stage with her.  I give this film just one &#34;little piggy&#34;, because I will never see it.
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|I'm a de niro fan some of his movies can boar you, this one does not, sit on the couch with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I thought the movies was sweet.  However it did seem like a few plot points were not well developed.  If you are looking for a fun hero movie, here you go.
