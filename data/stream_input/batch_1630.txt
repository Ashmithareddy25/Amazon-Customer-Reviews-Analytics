B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the perfect way to save all those great things you find online. I have been using it daily.
B004UID2LC|2.0|it used to be great but it stopped downloading songs and videos even though i tried uninstalling and reinstalling ;(
0553381709|5.0|...so far.  This book is packed full of action and intrigue.  Many of the dramatic events that occur in this book have had significant impact on the the plot and characters going forward.  All I can say is that you need to buy this book just for the Red Wedding - Wow!...just wow!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Its a great little time killer. I play it whenever I can get some time to play this great game!
B005USZYDU|5.0|This book had an excellent story line. It kept my interest through the entire book. John Grishman has produced another hit.
030758836X|4.0|The twists and turns in this book are so worth the read - I won't give away any details, but it is a smart book for mystery readers.  I was disappointed at the end though - it felt like author ran out of steam, which is too bad since the rest of the book was great.  I know if they make this into a movie, the ending will be different, otherwise everyone will leave the theatre quiet with a \\"huh?\\"
B0091XRL86|5.0|Im always looking for cute movies to keep my two year old entertained while I get a couple things done and this definitely does the job. It is for sure a kids/family movie, but I also find it quite entertaining. In fact I've probably seen it ten times already and haven't got sick of it yet. The plot is engaging, there is enough action and \\"special effects\\" to keep my kid excited, and there are enough \\"adult\\" jokes thrown in to keep mom and dad laughing too.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|Maybe I missed the point, but all the story consisted of was two strangers meet on a train, get off the train and spend time together and talk, talk, talk;  agree to meet in the same city at a future date, get back on separate trains and go their separate ways.  Not much of a story here.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As before, more sex in fact I skipped over some parts of the sex, not because it wasn't hot, it was, but , lets just say, too much of a good things can get somewhat boring.<br />The mystery was good and the finish was what I hoped for. Once again, a very decent read worth your time.<br />JW
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent, very strong book, a very good description of the judicial system and how it works, etc., don't want to put it down.  Very sad ending, never thought the mother would do something like that.
B008MLNDEO|5.0|A unique, somber, era supportive soundtrack that just keeps the movie itself flowing plus its a moving piece to listen too by itself.
1469984202|5.0|I have probably read over one thousand books in the science fiction genre - this is one of the best.  The author portrays developing characters in a quick (but not hurried) plot.  The mystery elements are well executed and compare well to parts of Asimov's robot series.  The limited world setting was well done with one exception:<br /><br />Spoiler Alert<br />When Juliette navigates from the submerged floor of mechanical, she is rising something like 30 floors - she should have experienced some decompression sickness, aka the bends.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I don't even normally read a lot of fiction, but after reading \\"Gone Girl\\" by this author, I couldn't wait to read her other books.  This book didn't disappoint.  It's another page turner that keeps you enthralled every step of the way.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Excellent...up to the minute detailed news covering the US, Europe and rest of the world.  Makes it easy to stay informed on the run. Gives a different take on world issues.  Great video content too.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|After slogging thru Atlas Shrugged, this is a comparative walk in the park. The Fountainhead should be required viewing or reading for anyone in the creative trades. The movie, with Gary Cooper, is beautifully filmed and tightly edited. A must see.
B0027MJU00|4.0|hard to put down  not as good as her latest novel but i would buy another of her books when it becomes available
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game was well worth it. Difficult but very entertaining!! Had to use the walk through a couple times. I recommend to anyone who likes puzzles.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|I guess the Killers ran out of ideas so they opted to go electronic. There are no kick ass songs on this album. This album will put you to sleep.  The tempo is slow and lethargic. The lyrics are childish and uninspiring. I would have never become Killers fan if this had been the first album I heard. Farewell.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|I've tried many productivity apps that claim to support GTD (Getting things done). This one doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but what it does have fits very well into the methodology. What it's missing are things that GTD people don't focus on, so it's really not lacking anything. I would like to see some features like sub tasks, and WYSIWYG editing of notes, but those gaps don't hinder usage to get things done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it! I cant find anything to complain about! it is just like being on your regular computer. its awesome! sometimes it takes a little while to load but I think that is more of a problem with the Internet.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I bought the book on release day and could not put it down.  Kudos to the soldier who was compelled to give us a boots on the ground perspective of this historic event.  The book was great, but left me wanting more.  I would love if Jen, the person who worked on tracking Bin Ladin for years, could publish her story as well.  But I don't see lightning striking twice.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|I know this is subjective, but I think The Unforgiven is one of the 10 best films ever made. An amazing study of the good and evil that live side by side in most people, beautifully shot, splendidly acted and cut. This is a great, great movie.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Amazon MP3 is always my first choice for music purchases. It almost always beats iTunes pricing. I also like that occasionally they give me free music credits for being a loyal customer.
B00846REIS|3.0|The author does try to write a good story... but forgot about the plot in the midst of all of the sex scenes. It was too much -- you can't flip a page without feeling like you need to cover your eyes again because here they  go. I was also unimpressed with the female character's \\"storyline\\" (if you can call it that) -- she obviously has issues but the author doesn't seem to be trying very hard to resolve them. All in all -- just an okay read. I wish I'd saved my money for something else.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|The book follows the concept that we can evaluate and act after death, all through the internet and software.  This is a very interesting concept.  The book was compelling and fun to read.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a very enjoyable but addicting game. You will find yourself cursing those Pigs!!!!! I enjoy the puzzle aspect of trying to figure out where to use which bird and the levels can be quite maddening.
B003MX94EK|5.0|we've seen it before, and I must say the unrated version is not really too different. But, it was fun to watch either way.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it wont download. tell me how to fix it please! its a good game on Pc and xbox but I want to play it on the kindle!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was sort of fascinating for the first several chapters.  Getting further along in the book, I began to find it predictable, repetitive, and even boring.  How long can one go on about sex?  Forever, at least in this book.  The ending made me decide to get book two, as I thought it was going to go toward a different, and more mysterious track. After all, how long could they keep repeating the same theme.  It was even worse, so I will not be ordering any more of this series.  If you want to read about never-ending varieties of sexual behavior, repeating over and over, this is for you.  I am done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This plays like my favorite classic solitaire. It is easy to play on Kindle Fire. I like the options that allow you to play many different ways.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I started playing Online mahjong not too long ago.and became addicted.  I had a hard time finding. an free one that was too short, often. with a story line that was sitting you up to pay for the next level. This one has many games with in levels,  and they are timed you fan go back and try to best your time.
B0050DZN4K|1.0|The product just hangs and states 'Logging In' when I try to access it on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would love to use and do use it on my other devices.  It's a shame it can't work here...
B0088WGBC8|3.0|Pretty good movie. Some twisting and turning that make it interesting and the action is non stop.  I'd suggest you rent it if you want a cheap thrill.
1119962846|5.0|After listening to Andrie de Vries' talk at LondonR [...] about how he and Joris Meys went about writing \\"R for Dummies\\", I thought I purchase a copy of the book for people at work who may have had little or no contact with R. I'm pleased to say that de Vries and Meys have produced a book that contains all the essential information to get a complete novice working usefully in R quickly. In particular, \\"R For Dummies\\" covers data input and output; matrices, arrays and data frame structures; dates; vectorized calculations; graphics; and add-on packages. These are all areas that new users of R can find difficult. I particularly liked the chapter on 10 things you can do in R that you would have done [dare-I-say-it less efficiently] in Excel.    Experienced R users (myself included) will find this book too lightweight. It generally stops at the point where many existing users will wish to begin. This is of course not a book aimed at such people. I do, however, thoroughly recommend \\"R For Dummies\\" to completely new or inexperienced users of R. It will provide a springboard to more advanced texts such as Venables and Ripley's two books, \\"Modern Applied Statistics with S\\" and \\"S Programming\\" (the latter book is not for the faint-hearted); Hadley Wickham's \\"ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\\"; and the large number of other books describing detailed areas of the S language and/or R implementation. \\"R For Dummies\\" also provides useful directions to the various R online communities. Other introductory books on R exist but this is a compact text that will get new users of R started quickly. Buy it with confidence if you are such a user.
B004LROOUK|4.0|While I did find this guide slightly lacking in information compared other Rough Guides from other regions such as Europe, I think Rough Guide does a far better job than Lonely Planet Japan which only spends about, roughly, 2-3 pages on Osaka, which is a major city. Lonely Planet spends most of their focus on Tokyo, while Rough Guide does try to spread it around. I visited Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, based on the book and had little to no difficultly (combined with Kansai region provided maps) planning my daily adventures. I still find (especially after having lived in Asia for two years) that almost all travel guides seem to be unable to capture the right amount of information like they can for more traveled areas such as Europe; so knowing this is the case across the board, I would say Rough Guide did a pretty good job capturing a balanced amount of info.<br /><br />I do think they should consider including much more detail in assisting the reader in locating places when writing a book for English speakers where the country being visited has an entirely different alphabet, it makes a difference.
B007MJSQSK|3.0|Tintin was smashing. It was an action adventure for the whole family. I recommend it to anyone. Go see it.
B001NKI60W|3.0|I think they could have found actors with better voices but big names sell tickets.  Was ok but the Broadway show is 100 times better.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Had 2 of the same controllers for many years and it still worked great. You can use it without cords and go a decent distance and continue playing.<br /><br />The time it can go without being charged is surprisingly long, ie several years.<br /><br />Worth the money and quite capable of being dropped often.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I grooved to level 48. Then my village went to space.  Promised the acorns I lost. Waiting for their arrival.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This has to be the most awesome movie in years!!! Made me wish the U.S. still had REAL BATTLESHIPS!!! GO MISSOURI...
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|The game installed just fine on Kindle fire and Galaxy tab 10.1 devices that I have and the graphics is pretty nice. The Game has ZERO in-app purchases and ZERO permissions. This itself deserves stars! The game-play is nice and gets you thinking and exercises your brain.<br /><br />The intent of the game obviously to move the cubes from side to side using touch controls (Tapping) in clockwise direction and arrange them such a way that you get that required 'AWESum' number. If the blocks line up correctly you score points. If you do better and are able to land number of blocks simultaneously to get the number needed twice in the same move you get multiple bonus score and another 'swap' of token. There are points for matching the desired SUM. BTW, You can also flip the number blocks down make them fall faster to the bottom. Look out for that target number when you add the cubes vertically However, you can achieve the required SUM by adding two stacked cubes not three.<br /><br />There is good instructions provided in the game as it starts for the first time. I do appreciate this part of the work done by the developer. The music is bit annoying especially for me as I cannot add numbers fast enough when there is distraction and the music can be distracting to me. Luckily you can turn that off. - Thank goodness!<br /><br />This game is a keeper. Super for both Kids and Adults alike - Very good Free APP of the day.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|One really can't review the third book without having the background of Books 1 and 2.  This  really is a romance novel with some expicit pornography and mystery  laced through it. Very well written with some really adept touches (the e-mail coversations and the thoughts of ANA not expressed verbally but internally. Christian is a bit over the top and adds a little unreality to the books but overall I enjoyed all three books. They are quite long and having them on my Kindle was a great way to not only save a little money but not have to carry a big volume arround.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was very good and I can't wait until October 2nd, 2012 so I can find out what happens next. It keeps you focused on the events with Eva and Gideon. Despite their pasts they have managed to come together. Their love for each other helps them live from day to day. It will be interesting to know what has happened to Gideon as a child, the reason he has such bad dreams.
0800177177|5.0|if you love vampiers...<br />this is not the twlight crap<br />this is not dimond covered vamps<br /><br />this is the real deal, the Dimond in the stone, the best vampire movie ever<br />good plot<br />amazing acting<br />stunning visuals<br /><br />and the one of the most kick ass bad guys you will ever see, so creepy so strong so much power !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three of the fifty shades, and couldn't put down any of them.  They were differant and there was a lot of sex, put the book had a great story line, and they continued each one with out missing a step was great.  I was hoping for another.  I read a lot of authors and this is the first time I had read E.L. James books, and I will be looking for more.  When you can't put a book down, you know you have found a good author
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great reading! I completely enjoyed the whole series!!! What fun & I would highly recommend this series to any age!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I have been reading, off and on, historical fiction books about the Tudors and the Wars of the Roses.<br />I read the Red Queen and the White Queen and both were great reads, if you like this type of book and reading about this time frame in history. I did find all of them a little confusing, trying to keep track of siblings, cousins and various marriages, so this one was no more confusing than that. I actually felt this helped clear up some of the confusion, but it may be that I am finally remembering more about each family! I felt this book offered up a different point of view regarding all of the rulers and a different perspective on Richard and especially about Elizabeth Woodville and King Edward. I used to feel more sympathetic to them but this book makes you see why some would feel threatened, especially in those times with belief in black magic and other superstitions. If nothing else, it makes you realize while they led a privileged life, their hold on power and the ensuing riches was tenuous if nothing else. I am also enthralled with the way of life during this period for both the peasants and the royals.
B006OT03BM|4.0|The set looks good<br />it looks good when opened, but mostly is cardboard, it's easily ruind<br /><br />it's better to guy it and place it behind a galss window, and watch the movies on their normal Blu-ray's instad of using this one,<br />it's an OK set.... I'v seen better, not very impressive
0307352145|5.0|We have a very quiet, shy daughter. People keep telling us we need to \\"fix\\" her but there's nothing wrong with her. This book helped me understand her better and give me ammunition to support/defend her.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This app keeps telling me that it needs updated.... but i cant figure out how to update it. could someone please help me.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I found this book to be okay. As a thirty something year old mother, I related more to the parents in this book than to the main characters.  I did like the love story in this book as it was very sweet, but I think overall I found this book to be a little depressing. The ending was pretty ironic....  I'll leave it at that!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I usually do not play games on my phone but this is a very addictive game. I would not have bought it, but as one of the free apps of the day I said what the heck and that was it from there.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|one of the greatest movies. i love this movie so much i re-brought on blue-ray.I hope you enjoy it as much i do.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|After watching this documentary, I can only hope that I get a chance to eat Jiro's sushi before he is no longer able to do it.  While it is a fascinating look at Jiro and the requirements of becoming a sushi chef, I wish that the pacing was a little faster and that filmmakers went more in-depth on the content.  Still, it is a completely enjoyable documentary.
B003X27L9U|5.0|This book presents a unique and insightful view of one of life's more terrible phenomenons from a powerful and often little considered point of view.<br />A triumph.
B005Q6GIY0|5.0|I love Sons Of Anarchy season 4 I have watched this show from the beginning , every season. It just gets better all the time . One of the fantastic things about this product is being able to watch it with out commercials.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Great movie very close to the original book or comic book that I remember. Great for kids also if you like action and sci-fi movies come see this film.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use it a couple of times a day to remind me about things AND it wakes me up every day.  What more can you ask for?  The free one was what I had, and I purchased it simply because it was such a great help to me.  Thanks Alarm Clock Xtreme.
B008K3HRF0|2.0|I find it ironic a man who is an author and prints his books on paper to be so against those who cut down the trees. Dont get me wrong, I love trees and I believe in planting trees but I have no problem with loggers, if anything I think they make use of the trees before they get wasted in a forest fire. Didn't care for this movie at all. I just saw that it was produced by the same company that made Despicable Me so I thought it would be a good one for my kids... Should have watched the trailer, oh well...
B004LROUNG|4.0|I found the book to be suspenseful not knowing who were actually the \\"bad guys\\" or the \\"good guys\\".  Mr. Grisham's book is getting like so many others of his that the courtroom scenes are getting a little boring and technical.  Altogether, it was an excellent book and I recommend it to anyone who likes lawyers and courtroom battles.
0938045768|5.0|I got this book in feb. 2 years ago, started slow, put money in bank, as the author says, and now i'm half way trough with training. Very good and simple to follow routines and don't take much time either.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I've used many Nikon speedlights over 20+ years, sometimes they improve a lot, sometimes they go backwards it seems.<br /><br />Having used 5 SB-800's for the past near-decade or so, i wanted a newer one mainly for on-camera fill and to use as the Master for the older units when i didn't carry my SU800 flash controller. It does work very well as a master unit, and you don't have to carry another piece plus the CR123A batteries for the SU800. THis is a major selling point for me, and if you dont already have a SU800, this is a good alternative for just using as a controller with other Speedlights.<br /><br />The 700 model is actually BETTER than the 800 in a few respects: the controls use some dedicated switches for M/TTL, and slave functions. You have to go thru a bunch of pages of menus to get to the function you want with the older 800, then back in and out, what a ridiculous mess of a menu, Nikon. This is MUCH better and faster, and is the reason i hated the 800 the day it came out, even though i've used it on a daily basis professionally for years now. The thing is, the much older SB26 had the same switches essentially, years ago! So Nikon actually went back in time and realized the OLD way was better, thankfully.<br /><br />I do not like that this unit is actually bigger than the 800 (altho smaller than 900) and uses s newer, weird-fitting bounce cover. Think they just did that to try to sell more accessories, again. So if you lose one, it wont fit or be interchangeable with another, even their own speedlights. Not to mention an off-brand such as Stofen, who made them long before Nikon and other major brands stole the idea and started making their own with their flashes.<br /><br />The really bad thing is that i find it tends to be less accurate on-camera than my old 800's were/are. Sometimes it just totally blows out the exposure/dumps for no reason. The 800s seemed much more reliable and consistant with exposure.<br /><br />The battery chamber/latch is different. I've read of some problems with this, but so far mine does seem to work fine and is an improvement, it doesnt fall of and get lost at least every time you need to change batteries.<br /><br />Seems like a solid flash overall, but think it should be more compact, it's unnecessarily large for the size of the flash tube i think.<br /><br />Doesn't have a PC sync jack. Big no-no for most Strobists, but i'd rather it had a 1/8\\" jack anyway. I may put my own in it if i feel the urge (don't recommend if you are not electronics-inclined though, and you'd void your warranty).<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a decent flash, but i think Nikon just has to change things for the sake of changing up models and such. And it still isn't that reasonably-priced either, just more affordable than the \\"pro\\" model.ent.

0345803485|1.0|...and your ability to laugh the entire way to the bank for writing doubly triply crap like this. Who knew that to be a best selling author, you need to be a forty-something woman who writes like a sheltered fifteen-year-old.<br /><br />The only way I got through this book is reading it as if I was dramatically reading it or taking everything literally. Believe me, \\"I flush\\" became less annoying and more funny.<br /><br />The sex is ridiculous. It's not hot, erotic or even sexy. If people think it's so racy... you need to broaden your horizons. Or don't because it might shock you beyond recovery.<br /><br />The only good thing about this book? At least I didn't waste my money on it.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Battleship is a great action movie.  Non-stop action with excellent graphics.  It was very well developed and nicely put together to make it belivable.  The characters are a bit over produced/developed but for the most part believable.  A good shoot-em-up movie that entertains.

B001EC2ISA|4.0|[[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]<br /><br />Beetlejuice, the Tim Burton classic from 1988 now comes to you packaged as a 20th Anniversary DVD edition.  Michael Keaton, I think in one of his best film performances brings down the house.  Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best.  The DVD also has special features, although nothing to make your head spin, but it offers several episodes of the cartoon series from the late 1980's.  But beyond that, nothing too spectacular; not that it needs that much more. A simple classic comedy that if it doesn't make you laugh, something is wrong with you and you should be exorcised!  With that being said, buy it if you don't own it. It's a must have dark comedy.

B001MEJY8W|1.0|As the title states, I rarely feel compelled to write a review on anything... be it a book, a movie, a restaurant...anything. Alas this crap storm of a movie has prompted a rare staging from me.<br /><br />Long story short.... what in the hell did I just watch? Holy freaking crap am I ever upset that I took the advice of you reviewers! How on Earth was this given such a high overall rating!? Let alone even receive a budget to film and distribute? Has the basis of a horror movie really become \\"how realistic can we make  skinning a person alive look\\"? ......... guess that was a spoiler alert. sorry?<br /><br />cliff notes:<br /><br />If you have ever wanted to see what a vagina looks like without skin... skip to the end and save yourself an hour and a half of complete garbage (with subtitles none-the-less).

B008FTAAG2|4.0|In This Moment's newest release \\"Blood\\", is pretty good. And besides Screaming, she can actually sing (I dig the screaming though), I would classify this \\"Heavy Pop Metal\\". Be careful about which version you get!, One version adds an additional track \\"Closer\\" a NIN cover, you know the one, {♪\\"I wanna 'F' you like an animal\\"♪} They could have made it heavier, but it sounds great!... If you're into Heavy music with Screaming chics (FeMetal, as I call it)... Check out ~Kittie~ and ~Otep~(much heavier), ~Straight Line Stitch~{they are a bit heavier} and ~Butcher Babies~... and if you lean towards the more Poppy Metal, check out ~Otto's Daughter~{the songs; Monsters, Angel, and Prison Walls} ... Keep Heavy Music Alive! ♫ ♪ ♫

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think I need an intervention. I need to get all the medals and achievements and buy all the things from the store! Can't believe this game is still fun. It varies the challenges just enough to not get repetitive and there's lots of customization and goodies and the scientists! Oh it feels good to hurt them!
B004ZN9R6G|5.0|I love the entire album, but Childhood's End is one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs ever. Like Morrison and all the poets, philosophers, and many other seekers of God, I've always been a word man. In the beginning was the Word, and God was the Word. Music, like painting and sculpture, is at its best the language of the angels, a form of communication that cloaks experiences so profound our earthly language fails. Music is the proverbial carrot on the end of the legendary stick that keeps drawing words out in our eternal quest back to that state of blissful communion together, before we were born and after we die. The lyrics in this song are road signs to the accompanying music; together they record the journey full circle from Alpha to Omega as we re-unite in the Universal Mind with each other, the state of conscious being we call God:<br /><br />Childhood's End<br /><br /> You shout in your sleep.<br /> Perhaps the price is just too steep.<br /> Is your conscience at rest if once put to the test?<br /> You awake with a start<br />  to just the beating of your heart.<br /> Just one man beneath the sky,<br /> Just two ears, just two eyes.<br /> You set sail 'cross the sea of longpast thoughts & memories.<br /> Childhood's end,<br /> Your fantasies merge with harsh realities.<br /> And then as the sail is hoist,<br /> You find your eyes are growing moist.<br /> All the fears never voiced say you have to make your final choice.<br /> Who are you and who am I to say we know the reason why?<br /> Some are born;<br /> Some men die beneath one infinite sky.<br /> There'll be war, there'll be peace.<br /> But everything one day will cease.<br /> All the iron turned to rust;<br /> All the proud men turned to dust.<br /> And so all things, time will mend.<br /> So this song will end.
B004TI5N38|5.0|You can't go wrong with any Baldacci but this is one is hard to put down. You get so involved in the characters and sometimes find yourself holding your breath or gasping!  Can't get this one out of my head.
B0090EIILU|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible.  Literally all the good scenes were in the commercials.  Don't watch this unless you are on a serious amount of drugs, or you have insomnia and need a nap.<br /><br />My wife hated this movie more than I did.
B005721W9O|5.0|I'm almost embarrassed to say how many times I've watched Galaxy Quest. It's just good fun & has a number of well cast characters. I'm not good at remembering actor's names, but Prof. Snape from the Harry Potter movies and the guy who plays Monk are just plain great.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I enjoyed the entire movie, HUNGER GAMES, but the ending reminded me of the old movie, LOGAN'S RUN, with Michael York.  There are several other movies that have that same theme because the same type ending, however, the \\"younger generation\\" has (more then likely) never seen LOGAN'S RUN.  Perhaps you should offer that movie to the public.  Otherwise, it was quite exciting to watch.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love this game. Its super fun and addicting. Perfect time waster. I wish all the other jetpacks have a purpose, because its all basically just different graphics.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a tantalizing novel helping resizzle marriages all over the United States and beyond. After reading the entire trilogy, I was left wanting more and wondering where my Christian Grey could be found. Absolutely worth rereading!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app for my kindle fire.  it has recently started loading slowly, but it eventually pops up and is awesome!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This was a great book, read the whole thing in about 4 days, dreading the end of it. Just the right amount of adventure and fantasy, with plenty of wit and cleverness. It was a fun ride. I was barracking for the hero the whole time, the only frustrating thing was the number of struggles and set backs he had - I just thought, give this guy a break! But luckily as with all the best heros, he's got some tricks up his sleeve to get him through. All in all, if you like your adventure with magic and intrigue on the side, it's worth your time and money.
B008MIZ7X2|5.0|Love this show!! It really does keep you guessing and wondering.  But if we find out who, then the show would be over... and I like all the story lines of each character.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great story that moved along quickly. Interesting characters and historical references. One of the best in this genre I have read.Have started sequel and it's wonderful, too.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Good animation. But too many left-wing ideas that weren't originally in the book. It was over-whelming and a bit annoying .
0811870413|4.0|Well written book with clear and consise instructions.  Lots of process photos make following the instructions easy.<br />Would recommend this book to anyone who's into good, wholesome breads.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Enjoyed the last of the three second best with the first book being #1.<br /><br />Freed was just a little too much with a everyone living happily everafter, except Jack of course.<br /><br />I did like the final two chapters written from Fifty's point of view and we are left with the thought that perhaps there will be more.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting to hear how the capture really happened.  I cannot see why the government is so upset about it, there weren't any secrets exposed.
B002361MLA|5.0|A good surprise, a very clear and pragmatic approach to how to better lead with everyday anxieties and stress. I found this reading very interesting with a true depth of thought. Strongly recommend.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I'm not gonna pretend I am some hooty-tooty movie reviewer like some people on Amazon.<br /><br />All I'm going to say is I laughed through the whole movie.  It was definitely worth the rental.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I didn't know anything about this book before I purchased it.  When it went to another chapter, I thought I was starting a new book until the weave between the chapters was introduced.  I am going to finish it because I bought it, but I certainly don't look forward to getting into it every night.  Would I recommend it to my friends - no.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is fantastic! I use it on a daily basis (i.e school and weekend) It never fails to wake me up to a specific playlist.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My title says it all, aside from the explicitness I would not call it raunchy at all. Fell in love with the characters, although I wouldn't normally lend myself to the \\"hype\\" on this one? I AM SO GLAD I DID!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like this app. I love the song and wish that I could get the title of it. Sometimes there are littlest glitches that are annoying.
B008JAG2AA|4.0|American Reunion was funny, but mindless.  Entertaining, but won't win any awards. It made me nostalgic for the original.  Worth renting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book didn't end how I wanted it to but was still a great ending.  Cant wait to compare the next movies to the book
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game doesn't get boring. oh say can you see by the dawns early light. what so proudly we hailed at the...
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Treasure Island inspired my husband to read more books as a child and it is now working it's magic on our son.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|It's a great story and a great price.  I was impressed with the detail and flow of the story.  It reminds me of best sellers like \\"The name of the Wind\\"
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an excellent story not just about the taking down of Osama Bin Lasen, but also the everyday sacrifices and complete dedication of these brave men. Reading this story just begins to demonstrate the tremendous commitment that these soldiers make on an every day with no recognition. They are amongst our bravest and most dedicated soldiers, yet their work, by it's very nature requires them to be constantly on call to go anywhere and perform any type of mission in extreme danger with the knowledge that in most cases no one will ever know what they did or accomplished but that their mission is critical to our safety and freedom. God Bless each and every one of them.
B0094KF4WG|3.0|Not a bad read, but too much detail of the author's earlier life leading up to the Mission itself. Certainly explodes the myth behind OSBL's final moments.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read all three and thought they were worth reading. Held my interest and had a few twists. I would recommend them.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My almost 2 1/5 year old loves this app.  It keeps him busy.  Even though the first four/five puzzles are free, I think he would enjoy doing all the puzzles.  I plan on purchasing the complete app.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|maybe one of these days after i stop playing with it my nephew will get a chance.  where were these when i was young?
B008XG1X18|5.0|great job!  pinterest app is perfect!  works great!  thanks!<br />it was so difficult to pinterest on my kindle fire before!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this little device! Works perfectly with my 6th gen nano[[ASIN:B002L6HE9G Apple iPod nano 8 GB Graphite (6th Generation) OLD MODEL]] and Jabra Bluetooth[[ASIN:B005FVNHBI Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellow]] headphones.<br /><br />The ONLY drawback thus far has nothing to do with the transmitter but everthing to do with MY clumbsiness. I wear my nano as a watch and since the connection is at the base it sticks out just a cm or so from my wrist.  I tend to forget this fact and will find my wrist hung up on just about anything I've managed to brush against.  That being said, I am quite impressed with the durabiliy of the transmitter since I've really whacked the crap out of it more than once.
B008D28HYS|5.0|It's a nice game that gets your brain working and links logic with visual patterns. The colors are vibrant, and the boxes are easy to manipulate.
B00932A2MC|4.0|The beginning of the movie was a little strange and i didn't think I would like the movie. After the first 15 minutes, the movie was okay and it kept my attention.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The whole family enjoys this game, from our 3 year old up to me the 40 year old!  Very fun game, plenty of replayable action, my 14 year old son and I are ultra competitive trying to one up each other getting to more and more levels.  Highly recommended.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I love this collection just as much as I have love their previous music. Pat is a true singer. I love that Train's music makes me feel good and that world is good.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Interesting to read what happened on the raid. The author is clearly not a literary genius, for his split infinitives and excessive use of acronyms was very distracting. I'm surpriswed his editor didn't pick these up and correct them. The history of his early career and previous missions did nothing for advancing the story of the raid for which reason most people read this book. In fact, if you skip those irrelevant chapters entirely the story becomes readable and interesting. I was also turned off by the blatant disrespect the author displayed for the president which offered nothing to advance the story but was further indication that the author felt his political views and opinions were important enough to include in the text, which they were not. I'd recomment reading this book if you are interested in the details of what happened on the raid but skip the irrelevant chapters and don't expect literary excellence and you won't be too disappointed.
030758836X|4.0|Good book - however it leaves you waiting for more..will there another? Hoping there will be another, it seems the story isn't finished :)
B0067AC5KA|5.0|now I love to read, duh! So, of course, I love all good stories, but<br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy bundle was a home run!<br />As soon as I was done with one book, I could start on the next.  Ironically enough, my sister had tried to get me to read the books for months, but I kept resisting.<br /><br />I was so saddened to learn that Stieg Larsson had died - what a great storyteller!<br />I had been hoping for a new favorite author.<br /><br />If you liked the movie, you'll love the book!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD a couple weeks ago. I already had the black and white version on my Kindle Fire, so I figured I would try the color version, despite the bad reviews.<br /><br />This is a great game, and I feel that the only reason people gave it sub-par ratings is because some of the levels are pretty hard, and it was too frustrating for them.<br /><br />You really need to be an avid puzzle/gaming person to enjoy this because it does require math skills, deductive skills, and patience, especially with the more advanced puzzles.<br /><br />I love it and would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a challenge.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Play this game all the time! Not sure why it's so addictive, but it's good exercise for my brain - kinda like sudoku.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book, No Easy Day was a great read and it was very interesting throught its pages \\"E-Book- Kindle\\" and if you are a reader of war history, you will enjoy this book.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The first book was good, this one is better. Getting a little tired of the near constant sexual encounters... spread them out a bit...geesh.  But love how this is turning into a love story... great cliff hanger at the end of this book... will buy the 3rd
B0042RJWTC|5.0|If you are a fan of the series and/or didn't catch them, then this is a MUST HAVE!!! Even if you are just fascinated by Tudor England, the price makes this set irresistible. While not completely historically accurate, there is nothing that one wouldn't love about this series.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I absolutely love Jorte....super easy to use, links easily to my google calendar! This is by far my favorite calendar app.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is awesome when it runs. It tends to crash a bit when trying to open it though. I love how easy it is to pock certain categories and it is really easy to repin.
0425263908|4.0|Very good book.  A lot like 50 Shades of Gray.  Needed a little more sexappeal to make it stand out a little more!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was an amazing book, I would reccommend any one to read this book.  There are no secrets, just real<br />life what they do to protect our country.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key is a gripping tale of a young Jewish girl and her family victimized by the Nazis in France in 1942.  Throughout her life she is plagued by her guilt on the death of her 4 year old brother. She blames herself for things that were not really under her control. The story is a reminder of the atrocities that took place at the time and brings to mind the atrocities currently taking place  in the world.  How sad that these acts can still take place in what we think is a civilized world.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The writing style of this book makes for easy reading.  As I read the author's story it was as if he was sitting at my kitchen table telling me about his life as a Navy Seal.  The background of where he came from, his training, his weaponry and various missions were just facinating.  There were no particularly huge revelations about the UBL mission.  But is was facinating to get an accurate take on it from start to finish.  Hats off to to this fellow for telling his story but more importantly thank you to him for his service to our country.  The author is an exceptional human being.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|i travel alot for my job and i am also a gamer. i love this product. i use it constantly when im on the road. it is reasonably priced and a very useful and convenient idea.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|While I don't play this game myself, my 3 year old grandson loves to play it on my Kindle and it occupies him for hours.  He loves it.
B004M8S440|5.0|A good, light read.  Georgette Heyer had a wonderful imagination and kept to her story line at all times.  Nothing \\"deep and meaningful\\"just light reading and very entertaining.  All of Georgette Heyer's characters are believable and entertaining.
0553386794|5.0|First of all I love that Martin is not afraid to kill off characters!<br /><br />The writing is absolutely amazing.  Martin's descriptions of everything are so vivid and detailed that I know exactly what he is trying to convey and am able to imagine the scene in my mind.  With that being said the descriptions can become a little lengthy and exaggerated at points, you just can't have it both ways though!  I also love the style and how he breaks each chapter up into a different perspective.  From that perspective the readers is able to get a whole three dimensional persona of every character and their thoughts/feelings on what is going on around them.  All of the characters are unique and have their own outlook on everything.<br /><br />There are separate storylines but Martin makes them all work and blend together literally creating a whole new and incredibly interesting world.  He also adds just enough history that allows the reader to get the full picture of the universe in which he is writing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a very intriguing novel that held me captive the entire time. Although I was totally engrossed in the book the ending was a bit disappointing for me.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Always enjoy the series.  Lots of information and keeps you on your toes.  I have read all the books and hope to read many more.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I read this book a few months ago and even after reading many many books since then, it is still one of my favorites. I'm not really into poetry but I loved the story of Will and Layken. I love the name Layken that if I ever have another daughter, I might just name her that. Anyhow, this was a quick and easy read with good writing to match. Although I was frustrated with Will at many times during the book, it all came together in the end. I was even happier to find out there was a sequel that I immediately jumped into.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so many ideas and its so addicting. ive found so much stuff to do with my 3 yearold and to help with my best friends wedding.
B00932ANQM|4.0|I had to watch this with my girlfriend and it actually surprised me. Turned out to be a pretty good movie...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was a fun read. I bought this version since I was borrowing the Wife's Kindle to read it there.<br />Wanted to read it again, so I purchased this one
B007FEFLTO|3.0|didn't read. i will wait for paperback at less than half the price.  or pay $20 at costco and share the book
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app - it's a lot quicker to see how much battery I have left. I especially like knowing how much time is left for doing different things like reading vs games or music...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Had me for every page. Loved the pictures though out the book! Really had me scared at points loved it!!!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Nice job. We finally get the straight information without political spin on the event. Goes to show what can be accomplished by well-trained staffs with a singular goal. The only disappointment is the feeling I got that it was a kill mission. I would have preferred a trial and execution in the U.S.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have not yet seen the movie, so I had no preset ideas about the book. I started the first one, thorougly enjoyed it and I was hooked. I couldn't put the second one down and went right into the third and final book. Now I have to get the movie to see how closely they match.<br /><br />I hadn't read anything by this author previouly, but found her writing very descriptive and well written.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was hooked from the start. This is one of the few books that can still let me escape from my modern day world.  I forget about time and everything going on around me when reading this.  I'm 2/3 of the way through the last book and am reading slower and slower.  I don't want it to end!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Because Ms. Dugard's story is so compelling, reading the book<br />goes very quickly - a real page turner.  It is almost unbelievable.<br />Sometimes difficult to comprehend what happened to her, still as<br />an adult in America who thought that our law enforcement folks<br />would protect such a young person, it was very shocking to know<br />that this predator got away with his crimes for nearly 20 years.<br />One has a feeling of pride that she survived for so long, but<br />still amazed at the control Garrido had over her so that she<br />never tried to escape.  Praise to the officers who finally<br />brought him down.
B00138H6I2|5.0|This is a great Billy Joel album.  Great ups and downs and a bunch of classics on it.  This man is a god.
0385344333|3.0|Having ridden the \\"Jack Reacher\\" express since he was introduced by Lee Child in the \\"Killing Floor\\", I found this effort very difficult to review.  Child made some clever changes in the storyline but also stumbled at times as he tried to keep the bar so high for Reacher's fans.  Child has clearly begun to struggle keeping Reacher's stories fresh and vital while avoiding the pitfalls of repeating plots and rehashing storylines--something not easy after 17 books that have created a gigantic following. The set up in \\"Wanted Man\\" is different and new for Reacher, but the whole conceit ultimately takes a toll on the reader's patience, interest level, and acceptability.<br /><br />Reacher is hitchhiking to Virginia when he is picked up by two men and a woman and the story unfolds as Reacher's keen insight and investigative experience begin to reveal that things are amiss and everyone is not who they seem to be.  It is an interesting concept to allow Reacher to use his akills and intuition to discover underlying plot threads in \\"real time\\" as he dissects the words and actions of his car mates. But this is at a cost as the reader becomes distracted by the sheer verbiage in descriptions of the passing landscape and mind games inside the car.  The whole car sequence, while vital to the plot was overly long and easily could have been truncated by several chapters.<br /><br />Reacher is ultimately abandoned in the boonies whereupon he conveniently joins forces with an FBI agent willing to ignore her protocols and bosses and joins Reacher on a fanciful flight after the fleeing men who we discover had left a dead man behind before car-jacking the female passenger's car.  There are reappearing characters representing the FBI, the State Department, and the CIA as well as local law enforcement who all seem bent on either solving the crime or making it disappear.<br /><br />Reacher's cerebral skills are more in evidence in this effort than his oft employed physical skills.  He intuits lies, motivations, and purpose from the conversations and actions of his ride sharers.  Child builds a palpably dangerous sense of menace within the automobile as the traveling companions lie, feint, and misdirect allowing the reader to wonder when the explosion of violence will occur.  The conflicting law enforcement agencies and references to the Homeland Security Act helps confuse readers as one group works to solve a crime that their superiors claim never happened.  For this reviewer, the ending was somewhat abupt and anticlimatic with some strange decisions about who should live and who should die.  The last glimpse of Reacher resuming his hichhiking on the interstate after all he has just been through seemed both convenient and unlikely.<br /><br />Is this the worst Jack Reacher novel as so many others are saying?  Not in my opinion because there are intriguing elements, interesting characters, some menacing suspense, and a mystery not solved until the conclusion (along with one unresolved thread).  So let's just say it was somewhere between his best and his worst.  But trying to create a novel where the story unfolds in real time as Reacher interacts in a confined auto with a sense of menace building ultimately results in a claustrophobic and overly drawn out sequence.  Also, strangely enough, several characters die in \\"A Wanted Man\\" that totally surprises the reader, especially the manner of their deaths considering their contribution early in the plotline.  The Jack Reacher novels are still great reading (some more than others) but visualizing Tom Cruise as a 6'5\\" 250 lb. mass of menace is something even my suspension of disbelief cannot handle.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Good compicated plot.  Character development well executed.  Just what I expect from Michael Connelly.  The Bosch character continues with increased depth into his personality.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|i am right this moment enjoying this \\"Eurythmics Ultimate Collection\\"  when amazon bugged me with an e-mail asking me to review it.  I think I am going back to that old adage that Big Brother is watching.  but never mind my paranoia,  the Music is great and doesn't music heal all wounds!  Seriously,  I wish I was older so that I could have married Annie Lennox.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a very good read. If you like Tom Clancy style war books then you will definitely enjoy this read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great read that is uniquely presented from two points of view of the story's two main characters.  An interesting thriller that will keep you engrossed and guessing...
B0033TI4BW|5.0|It's not at all strictly bound to psychology theories as in \\"dull and boring\\". The reading is compelling and gives you many many examples on how some of the concepts presented have been applied in the real world. A really useful appendix includes practical things you can do to move your life towards a \\"purpose, autonomy, mastery\\"-driven life. Highly recommended.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see a pre-screening of this movie and was blown away. I'm a huge A Capella music fan and a singer. What was amazing about the movie is that there is truly something for literally everyone. While it's not a movie for young children, I would guess everyone over the age of 13 will love this movie!! For the women there's an understated love story going on and for the men, there's very attractive women  and some seriously good humor... and it is funny throughout, it was engaging throughout and the music was amazing. The sound track alone will be worth your time and money when it comes out. I'll definitely be in line to purchase both the Blu-ray of this movie as well as the soundtrack.<br /><br />I've never written a movie review before but I was so impressed and so moved by this movie... I think you will be too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|First the first half of this book I was awestruck, particularly at the writing, so clever, so funny, so well-expressed. The problem was the last third when it all got too unbelievable and contrived. But I am still giving it 4 stars - five for the first half,three for the second.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Definitely a must read for anyone in any sort of professional role - this book does a great job at explaining how simplifications can have huge impacts on our complex tasks.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I haven't had any problems with the app yet. It's easy and nice to use.  I would recommend it to anyone who uses Facebook.
B00881VLCE|3.0|puzzles are fun but there are some features I think could use some improvement.  for instance I'd like to be able to go straight to the puzzle I'm working on when I open the app instead of having to search for it.
B003TY3F06|5.0|Top notch movie! A real classic. Packed with superstar actors and written by Quinton Tarrentino how could you go wrong.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Book was an amazing and well told story about a man that you can see as extremely human through his faults and failures, yet, ultimately he rises above his past and becomes a warrior, a leader, and a hero.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.  Set during WWII, it gave me a good insight into the mood of wartime England.  The characters were likable and realistic.  My sympathies even extended to the antagonist.  I highly recommend it.
B006HTUZ1C|2.0|Good idea for a game, but the controls are horrible.  Controls are very slow and this is crucial when the levels get higher and faster.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a beautiful, sexy love story. Sex between the pages of a book. I cannot wait to read part three!!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this is wonderful. absolutely thrilling game that i recommend. plus its free :)<br />so you should download it if you read this
B007HGPBRC|5.0|everybody, who is a caregiver of a cancer patient should read this. It gives you insight in the patients feelings, thinking, fears and hopes, the patient, at least in my situation won't reveal.Excellent writing, have to read it one more time to fully digest it, thank you
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great account of what our country's best warriors have to go through to keep us safe at night.  Very fast paced book, very insightful and a happy ending.  I know this book has been getting a lot of bad press from the liberal media, but it doesn't seem any out of line with the information provided in Chris Kyle or Marcus Lutrell's books and the criticism of the Whitehouse seems on par as well.  I have yet to read a book written by an \\"on the ground\\" operator that wasn't critical in some way of the Whitehouse, their branch or their superiors, and that goes all the way back to the books on Hathcock and Marcinko.<br /><br />Great read and looking forward to a follow up.
0812992784|5.0|At a Salman Rushdie lecture that I attended a couple of years ago, a well-intentioned member of the audience asked him to contrast  his life during the years when the Iranian fatwa loomed over his head and his now time of freedom. If I recall Mr. Rushdie's words , there were only two: \\"bad\\" and \\"good.\\" This author, beloved by many and still hated by others, has finally told us what his life was like during the decade or so-- the Ayatollah Khomeini issued the fatwa on February 14, 1989 for Rushdie having published THE SATANIC VERSES--  when there was a price on his head by Islamic fundamentalists  in his memoir JOSEPH ANTON.  (Forced to live in hiding, he chose the two first names of two of his favorite authors Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov for his pseudonym.)  His one word answer has stretched  to  over six hundred pages.  He has a lot to say.<br /><br />Mr. Rushdie seems to omit nothing. At times he is angry-- although from where I sit he usually shows remarkable control-- but always honest  (about both himself and others, even  telling the reader about some of the most intimate details of his marriages) and he never loses his sense of humor, as anyone who has had the pleasure of hearing him speak knows. But what Mr. Rushdie says over and over and what makes his story so important is that freedom of speech,  i.e., the freedom both to write and to read  is something worth dying for. In his own instance  Professor Hitoshi Igarashi, the translator of THE SATANIC VERSES into Japanese was murdered and  did pay the ultimate price. Dr. Ettore Capriolo was stabbed; William Nygaard, THE SATANIC VERSES Norwegian publisher, was shot. Both these men survived. While heads of government in the western world were not always so brave, often putting politics over the freedom of  writers to publish  and publishers caved in to fear-- it was years after the initial publication of THE  SATANIC VERSES that a major company in the U. S.  would come out with the paperback edition-- writers around the world came to Mr. Rushdie's defense: \\"I have been given a lesson, in these years, in the worst of human nature, but also in the best of it, a lesson in courage, principle, selflessness, determination and honor, and in the end that's what I want to remember: that I was at the center of a group of people behaving as well, as nobly, as human beings can behave.\\" Practically every major writer spoke out for him. The list is long. Two who did not were Roald Dahl, who called Rushdie \\"a dangerous opportunist\\" in print, and John le Carre, who also spoke out against him early on. He and Mr. Rushdie exchanged fire in a series of letters to THE GUARDIAN in November, 1997 after Mr. le Carre complained that he had been called anti-Semitic in the NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW by Norman Rush. \\"He (Rushdie uses the third person for his memoir) should have kept his feelings to himself, of course, but he couldn't resist replying.\\" Then Christopher Hitchens \\"joined the fray unbidden\\" and you can imagine how that fire got fanned. My favorite essayist compared the writer of THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD to someone who urinates in his hat and then wears it-- a bit of comic relief in a very serious book.<br /><br />Mr. Rushdie, during much of the 1990's lived as a virtual prisoner in the many places he lived  with members of the British secret police, whom almost to a person he praises, twenty-four hours a day. He looked forward, however, to his trips to the U. S. where he could move about with more freedom. He was well received here as a celebrity of sorts and met many famous people. One of my favorite stories among many is his account of meeting  Meg Ryan when she went into rhapsodies  over visiting India, and her love of what Mr. Rushdie calls the \\"guru industry.\\" He reminded her that if you grew up in India,  it was easy to conclude that those people were fakes-- a real conversation stopper.  He does  describe with great emotion his visit with his son Zafar to the land of his birth after he was finally given a visa after not being allowed to go to India for so many years. When in Mexico City  he spoke to Gabriel Garcia Marquez on a telephone call arranged by Carlos Fuentes. Marquez paid him what he says is the greatest compliment he ever received when he said that the only two writers he followed outside the  Spanish language were J. M. Coetzee and Rushdie.<br /><br />Even though Mr. Rushdie lived as a hunted man for so long, he worked diligently to have as normal a life as possible,  trying sometimes unsuccessfully to keep writing and spending as much time as possible with his son Zafar whose mother was his first wife Clarissa and with his second son Milan by his third wife Elizabeth. Some of the most poignant passages in the entire book have to do with his descriptions of these two sons. He loves them dearly and it shows.  Rushdie has a lot to say about love.  When he writes of his beloved mother who would not seek out her first love, her first husband, after the death of Rushdie's father although she lived for sixteen more years alone and never responded to any of her first husband's letters, this brilliant writer reminds us that \\"sometimes love is not enough.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, has anyone described literature and its importance better than Mr. Rushdie? \\"Literature tried to open the universe, to increase, even if only slightly, the sum total of what it was possible for human beings to perceive, understand, and so, finally, to be. Great literature went to the edges of the known and pushed against the boundaries of language, form, and possibility, to make the world feel larger, wider than before. . .

B004J5366M|5.0|I love this album. Different sound than anyone, excellent to read to or scrapbook to. I fell in love with this music quickly :)
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I originally got sucked into this game, then an update came along and would no longer allow it to open.  Forced to reinstall losing all previous save data. App steals money and forces you to start all over.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great story about one of the most important days in the history of the U.S. war on terror.  I'm so glad Mark documented the mission and some of the events leading up to Bin Laden's death. In my opinion, he took considerable care not to disclose anything that may jeopardize active Seals or other service personnel.  After reading numerous other books written by former Navy Seals, I don't see what the big stir is about the publishing of this book.  To Mark and to all active and former warriors, thank God for you!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was an alright read.  I did, however, learn a lot about combat and who is truly the best trained in the armed forces.  I always feel a sense of pride for these soldiers.  Without them we truly would not have the freedom to write reviews on books.  The book did keep me hanging on and I just couldn't see what all the fuss was about.  I would have liked to have seen the author go into more detail on the killing maybe even giving up details.  Also, tell us more about where he is buried ?  Why didn't anyone get to see the pictures?  I have many questions left to be answered.  It was still a good book to educate and teach all about life.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|The movie has action from beginning to end. It was like one long wild ride.<br />The fight scenes made you jump and cringe.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's a great option to have on my cell, for times when i don't have the space for my kindle in a smaller handbag.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is a must if you're publishing an e-book online for the Kindle. It gives detailed instructions not included in the step-by-step method you must navigate to upload your book. I had great success using this book while uploading my novels, Arrowstar and Honor Bound.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It gives an insight into the SEALs.  I think the author went to great lengths to make sure he didn't include any classified material but still told a complete story.
B000050WZY|5.0|I recently purchased this album on vinyl and have been totally amazed with the sound quality. I've had the CD version for several years and had thought that it had amazing sound quality until I got this on 180gr imported vinyl.. I played the CD and LP side by side for a true comparison. I used my Technics SL1200 MK5 turntable with a Denon DL301 MKII moving coil cartridge and an Onkyo SVL5 24 bit SACD player for this comparison. 'Yesterday' was the first song that I compared and after switching the input between CD & Phono 2 times it was quite apparent that the music that was in digital format sounded flat and lifeless compared to the LP.  The richness and warmth of Paul's voice with the string quartet accompanyment is breath taking, it truly sounded like they were right in my living room playing. The sound of the cello and violin are so clean & crisp that I could hear the rich undertones that the instruments bodies produced. At times I could hear Pauls breathing on the microphone as he sang his song. Every time I would switch back to the CD version it was quite apparent that this was a recording with noticible compression of the sound staging and imaging, truly lacking any of the warmth and detail that was on this vinyl LP.  I then compared 'Let it Be' CD vs Vinyl side by side. After just a few notes of the piano I stopped listing to the digitally compressed CD version, the piano really sounded like it was sitting in my house on the vinyl LP, on the CD the piano definately sounded like it was just another recording so I ended my comparison after 2 songs. There is no substitute for pure analog sound!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A wonderful end to a beautiful love story. Very trilling, a lot is reveled and explained literally laughed out loud at certain point.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I saw the author on TV and thought his argument against wheat was very convincing.  I'm not interested in losing weight but I am concerned about high cholesterol and blood pressure and in just maintaining good health.  The first part of the book was interesting and I thought eliminating wheat from my diet would be a good idea.  However, by the end of the book he was saying to not only eliminate wheat but way too many other things.  When he began to suggest eating unlimited amount of eggs, fatty meats and high sodium content foods I really began to question his information.  I will continue to keep wheat out of my diet to see what happens but I won't replace it with much of what he suggests.  I only gave it three stars because far too many people are overweight and need some advice.  Do your research and talk to your doctor before following this restrictive diet.
B00846REIS|4.0|They marketed this book as similar to 50 shades of Grey but I thought it was better.  It seemed more realistic and better written. I even ordered the next book already because I was interested in where it goes from here!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrist rocks, especially for DIY! Women's fashion, hair, and make-up are also super addicting!!! Such great sharing. A new pinker, but I'm definitely hooked!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found this book really exciting and was a bit worried in the begining.  I had heard it bordered on porn and that's really not my thing, but the banter that goes on between the characters is wonderful.  I swear I am related to the main characters Inner Goddess, who adds a great comody to the whole thing... I thought this book was great fun and really makes you think outside the normal box.  A fascinating read, I could not wait to start the second book so thank goodness for Kindle because I didn't have to...within minutes of finishing the first book in the trilogy, I had loaded and began to read the second book.  I am now on the third and have loved them all so far.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I admire this Navy Seal for his refusal to back down from writing this book despite the political pressures.  I really enjoyed this book and appreciate the accuracy of the events leading to the killing of Bin Laden.  I did not appreciate any bias nor do I think that the book was written for the sole purpose of personal gain.  I highly recommend this book without reservations.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Children and adults will love it, it's just as addictive as all the angry bird games. It has great graphics, too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read! Could not put it down. It was not just about the final mission, but about the life of a Seal - as well as other missions. Absolutely gripping. God Bless these men and women for what they selflessly sacrifice every day of their lives. They are a special kind of American - and I wish more of us were like them.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After all those positive reviews concerning Susan Collins's series I was really eager to read her books. I'm not disappointed - these books really ARE interesting but there is not much more to them. The final book of the trilogy did not stand out from the other two.Overall, it was a well spent time. I guess teenagers, for whom the books were primarily written will appreciate them more.
B009329ZF2|2.0|It has some action, some very little acting, and not much script.  I've really liked Battle - Los Angeles and was hoping for more of the same type of action.  You won't really find it here.  The action is too far fetched to be anything but laughable...but then, maybe it was supposed to be comedy.  I guess I like my action to be just a little more realistic - I mean, come on, get an old battleship commissioned and ready to fight in hours - it would take months if not years.  And to run it with a handful of personnel - impossible.  The script was 'see-thru', you knew what was going to happen in the movie from the opening scenes.  Guess I was just expecting more.  Don't expect much and you might like it.
B002NJUN44|2.0|Now, I should point out that I did not watch the entire thing. I was too bored to do so. I stopped at 32 minutes in before writing this review. So if the movie got amazingly better after that point - I am sorry for this review. Otherwise, this is what I have to say about this piece of garbage:<br /><br />I recently listened to Eragon and I loved it! I heard that the movie was bad but I wanted to see if it was really that bad. After all, it couldn't be as bad as \\"The Last Airbender.\\" It had to be better than that, right? Well not really. . .<br /><br />Like \\"The Last Airbender,\\" Eragon tries to cram an entire book into a little over a hour and half. Consider that the audiobook version of Eragon takes almost 17 hours to complete. How in the world are you supposed condense all that material into one movie?<br /><br />The answer is you can't. So either you try to cram everything in the book into one movie (like Eragon) or you branch into multiple movies (like the Lord of the Rings). Both have their drawbacks, however if it is done well then the result IS worth watching!<br /><br />Too bad this is not the case with this movie . . .<br /><br />The first 32 minutes are almost completely filled with exposition. There is little plot movement and all the characters are fairly flat. Despite knowing who these people are and their relationships to each other from the book, I found myself not caring about them or their fate.<br /><br />Most of this could have been explained by a montage followed by his uncle's death. It would have fit into the theme of Eragon and allowed you to get a gist of this stuff. There was no need to bore us with this. Just get to his uncle's death and the road already! That's what matters . . .<br /><br />If you are curious on how they messed up this movie then rent it and never think about it again. Read or listen to the book. You'll be glad you did!
B001AFF25W|4.0|Funny title but I think about my frog often during the day.  The title alone keeps the information at the forefront of my mind (have to go eat my frog!!).  Book well written.  Many things I already knew but needed my memory jogged.<br />Anxious to finish it and it's certainly a re-read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thought the author did an excellent job of presenting several aspects<br />of being a Seal, Seal training and deployment. Then the call to arms for<br />a special mission, the object of which is undisclosed. The preparation and<br />drills that followed and finally the green light to proceed.<br />The race to the final outcome is covered in detail. Truly deserving of<br />a four star rating.
B008MJC6ZS|4.0|I do so want to love Testament.  They are a classic thrash band with metal talents as good as any thrash band in the Big Four and elsewhere.  I am just not crazy about the lyrics.  I keep getting reminded of Spinal Tap as I listen to every song.  I still glad I have this record in my library, and all metal fans should also.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Just want to add my voice to the \\"thumbs-up\\" crew. Yes, this collection of stories/ novel told in different narrative voices and formats is not for the faint of heart, but I for one found it both addictive in process and rewarding in retrospect. Go to the website for the PowerPoint, and use the pause button frequently so that you don't miss a thing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an awesome insight into the DEVGRU (Seal Team 6).  Nothing adverse to the operations of the team is revealed in my opinion.  The writer even refers to the helicopters as Blackhawks.  The administration leaked more info such as the Whisperbird, than the writer.  Yes, he sighed a non disclosure but so did I and I wasn't even in the teams.  I was involved in physical security.  I admire this dedicated SEAL.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|I assumed all the short stories were centered around the Harry Bosch character but they were not. The writing was good but I was disappointed.
B003M6TVQI|5.0|Sure, it's another comedy/drama mired in crimes, crimes and more \\"grey area...\\" [you're welcome Matt...] but I love this show, more than chocolate.  Okay, yes - that's an incredible compliment, but I just ate a mini Hersheys bar... :o)  Seriously, I think the interaction between all of the characters is a finely tuned instrument, awesome rhythms in the delivery, and I truly enjoy Matt's \\"strut\\" - geez, is that just for Neal Caffrey, or is that how you really walk, Matt?  Thanks for bringing great entertainment to us.
B001GJ1BBQ|5.0|I bought this at the request of my 12 year old grandson.  First we rented it and he wanted to watch it over and over again.  So, I decided to buy it so he would have it at his house.  He absolutely loved the movie and continues to watch it and gets others to watch it with him.
B005LAII80|4.0|Dredd 3D takes place in a futuristic City with plenty of action that doesn't get in the way of story telling and character development. Well paced with some note worthy 3D moments.<br /><br />DREDD 3D STORY: Entertaining for the most part<br />The story is well told and set in a Megalopolis City, following Dredd as he's travels by motorbike after a gang of wasters, putting an end to them only to end up trapped inside a giant mall/apartment building on lock down. Calling the shots from the 200th floor is a ruthless, merciless female antagonist Ma Ma, short for her full name which includes the first two letters of her first and last name. She is distributing a slow-motion drug, and it's up to Dredd to stop her or perish at the hands of every armed citizen called to action by Ma if they want to regain their freedom.<br /><br />The story is given heart with trooper Anderson, a female mind reader on her first assignment with Dredd, who not only adds a soul to contrast against Dredd's cold, caculating demeanor, but she also adds some comical moments between her and Dredd, thanks to her mind reading ability. In a way, she was the star of the movie, but shared equal screen time with Dredd thankfully.<br />Their assault up to the top floor takes many twists and turns, with the bullets taking a break just enough to allow for character and story development before the guns begin blazing once more. Karl Urban does a great job as Dredd nonetheless, delivering believability in his role.<br /><br />ACTION: Well paced, with plenty of bullets flying at a steady stream, with easy to follow cinematography from start to finish. Many shots get up close and personal to the characters, but offer enough space to get a sense of location and character stance. The action is not constant, and allows breathing room for the characters to express themselves during the brief stealth moments or downtime. Several moments reminded me of DIE HARD. The cool twist was Dredd's gun had plenty of different ammunition types, from stun, machine gun, incendiary grenade, silencer, and more to add variation to his assault. Plenty of gory moments followed his ascent up the massive tower.<br /><br />3D JUDGMENT: Mixed Bag 3D gets better halfway on:<br />Dredd 3D has a combination of brilliant (slo-mo shots of glass or water flying looks amazing), good (most of the film) and poor (the first 10 to 20 minutes or so) 3D mixed throughout it's runtime, but most of the 3D is clearly restricted by the scene compositions usually including a very close foreground object, character or fence so close to the screen, that everything has to converge its focus on the frontal object, resulting in some average 3D where it could have been brilliant, like many of the scenes during slow motion.<br /><br />Peering down some of the hallways, you really get a sense of great space reaching far down the path, with objects jutting out from the sides, characters walking into the depth to great effect.<br />But not to overlook the flaws during the first twenty minutes of 3D shots, where we end up with a lot of timid 3D with minimal layers, plus combined with some conflicting reflective lighting effects where one eye sees light on the vest of Dredd, while the other eye only sees some of that light. Thankfully the problems clear up roughly after the first 20 minutes of 3D and the rest is mostly smooth sailing with good to excellent 3D.<br /><br />STORY: 8/10. Point A to B with plenty of conflict, along the way.<br />ACTING: 8/10. For an action movie, believable characters.<br />ACTION: 8/10. The action was fun to watch, but fairly basic in style.<br />FX: 8/10 Nice special FX and some nice gory moments in slo motion.<br />3D: 7/10. From brilliant to subtle, a mixed bag of mostly good 3D.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK: 9/10 Industrial, hard edged electronics compliment the action well.<br /><br />DREDD 3D is a satisfying shoot-em up action movie with a nice futuristic style worth a watch for the lead characters,action, special FX and 3D.action, special FX and 3D.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Still trying to understand the new website but it seem like it has great potential. I will continue to review my specific pin.  I found some of the information quite fascinating.  Fun site :)!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|First, before I review this film; people reviewing this film and giving it poor reviews are reviewing the wrong product or know nothing about what they purchased. One person is reviewing The Dark Knight Rises and another is upset because he expected something relating to Nolan's films and is declaring this a rip off.  I find those kind if irresponsible, uninformed reviews infuriating. Know what you are reviewing people. This is not Nolan Christopher's The Dark Knight Returns. The title is not a rip off of Nolan's films.  This film is based off one of the most influential Batman comics of all time. Nolan's films and titles are partially based off the 1986 comic book by Frank Miller which this film is depicting. In reality, had The Dark Knight Returns never been written there wouldn't be the Nolan films you see in the theater today.  Miller changed Batman from the campy hero of the 60s into the brooding angry man Burto and Nolan depict. I am not going to go over the plot. For those unfamilar with the story a simple wikipedia will suffice.<br /><br /> The Review: This film is excellent. I read the graphic novel about 9 years ago during the summer of 2003.  Although there are a few (positive) changes that lengthen the story, they are consistent so that Frank Miller himself might have written them. There are no serious changes. Everything you know that happens still happens.  The animation is amazing. I wish all cartoons had animation this good. It also has a very 80s feel to it, almost Cyberpunk without the cybernetics (if that makes sense).  Grimey. Dark. Corrupt. Horrible violence everywhere once you set foot in the city. Basically the future the way science fiction writers (and many criminal justice professionals) at the time were depicting the future to be.  The only cons were the voices.  I am a fan of the 1990s animated series. I think the voices were perfect.  Although not as good as Kevin Conroy, Peter Weller does a good job but takes some getting used to. The only voice I do not like is Comissioner Gordon's. He has a slightly whiney sound.  But this isn't a serious detraction from what is otherwise a masterpiece.  I will definately be purchasing this film.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|This book was a hard read for me to understand each character and i found it confusing at times.  The format of the book i did not enjoy which consist of all letters being written back and forth, this is what i found confusing for me.<br />I started reading it 3 different times  but due to the fact that i am in a book club and we descuss the book at our meeting i forced myself to read it and still did not understand some of the characters.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book as a good read.

0307455874|2.0|I have to say that I was surprised by this book.  Not necessarily that it's well written, or by the content - Obama has never had a problem clearly communicating his thoughts.  What surprised me was how little the book told me about what Obama's views really are.<br /><br />It's pretty clear from the outset that this was a book written by a man laying the foundation for a potential run at the presidency.  Obama writes very well from an \\"every man\\" point of view, relating efficiently and effectively, helping me feel the struggles that accompany being in office.  He covers the daily grind in stories here and there, talks about some past policy he supported and some things he wants to move forward with.  Some of his stories regarding establishing relationships are very entertaining as well.<br /><br />The book itself is separated into different topics.  With each new topic he'd start with an experience he had or a person he met, and use that as a way to relate the topic he's discussing in that chapter.  Some of the stories relate to the topics better than others, some have a clear relationship with the topic and some strain a bit.  How sympathetic you feel toward the stories, and thus the focus of the chapter, will depend directly on your political stance.<br /><br />I read this in preparation for the upcoming (Nov 2012) election, hoping I could get some idea who Obama really is and what he stands for.  I came out mostly disappointed as not a lot of it reconciles against his actions.  There is one chapter, however, that is extremely telling.  That chapter is 5 - Opportunity.  Chapter 5 is a detailed and thoroughly fleshed out exposition of what we've seen to date from Obama's domestic policy.  Regardless of how you lean, Opportunity will tell you exactly what you need to know, and you'll either love it or hate it depending on your ideology.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, can I recommend this whole book?  No.  But I would strongly recommend chapter 5 to absolutelyeveryone.

B0081L37Z0|2.0|It was good intermainment to watch on my flight but I would not pay full price to see this movie on the big screen.  Story line was not great and the acting was lacking.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game.  Closer to the real thing than most.  The sound effects and *shake* mode are fun.  Great for all ages.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Likr it. Good time waster. Makes you use your brain. I would recommend this game for kids to develop their math skills.
0470901071|4.0|Overall a really good purchase. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to get CCNA certified.<br /><br />However, 4 stars because the book never came with the CD for me. Beware!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Probably a 70 year old woman would be the last person one would expect to be buying this book and reading it straight through in two days, but this is exactly what happened.  Then, my 74 year old husband (retired Air Force) did the same thing.  We agree that these men deserve our highest regard.  To that end, it is the President that needs to be sued for releasing information about this activity and making it available to Hollywood.  He has put their lives and their families at risk and exposed our military and the intelligence community for nothing more than the purpose of politics.  Our military deserves better!  God bless these authors.

B0088XXCZ6|3.0|The best songs from Fiona Apple's last album are the two Jon Brion productions left intact after the singer decided to remake it without him. She enlisted the less experimental, more radio-friendly talents of Mike Elizondo and Brian Kehew. Now the expulsion of Jon Brion is complete as his music is nowhere to be heard on this new set, entitled The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than The Driver Of The Screw And Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do because, in Fiona Apple's world, there is no character limit on album titles.<br /><br />What's pleasing to the ears is the minimalist approach of these songs. Drummer Charley Drayton is involved, but this isn't an album that's driven by beats, so the drums aren't so obvious. Even on a song like Left Alone, which begins with thirty seconds of drums, they're panned to the left or the right and set at a relatively low volume in the mix. In fact, all of the percussion sounds take a back row to Fiona's voice, which is almost always right there up front. For some reason, the starting leads of Daredevil are (also) panned to the left.<br /><br />With that, the overall message seems to be, \\"Hey, listen to what I have to say.\\" But this is mostly just amorous poetry about Jonathan or whatever boyfriend she's thinking about at the time, even the closing song. That means Fiona Apple is a typical romantic; \\"I love you,\\" she says to her Valentine; who stands out only because of her quirkiness. The closest thing to exceptional talent here is the refrain of Anything We Want; the album's best and most easily accessible song. The best moment is when the Hot Knife piano first comes in.<br /><br />But the first song, Every Single Night, is annoying. I don't know what made her think it was a good idea to stretch \\"brain\\" out to eight syllables. It would sound silly enough at two. She's also grown careless when it comes to the sound of her voice, sometimes letting it distort into an ugly growl as if vocal intonation is her sole way of conveying strong emotion. Not that such flaws would matter much if she were singing pretty melodies consistently instead of contrasting them with not-so-pretty ones for the sake of artistic creativity.<br /><br />marcellee.comconveying strong emotion.

1933633867|5.0|I'm a multi-disciplinary thinker and I read a lot about history, so I consider most people mistaken when they assume the complexities of the modern world are new and unprecedented. Certainly there are remarkable changes occurring, like the internet, but most existing institutions are grounded in historical ones and human nature hasn't shifted a millimeter.<br /><br />Occasionally, I'll read a book that sheds a broad swath of light on the big patterns that have given rise to our world. Guns, Germs, and Steel was one of these. Repetitive and over-simplifying it was, but it touched on something primal in the human condition: what the author called \\"history's broadest pattern.\\"<br /><br />Debt deals with another: the very basis of value and obligation, which are at the root of what we vaguely call economics.<br /><br />The first half of this book blew my mind. It places debt at the very core of what it means to live in a human society. It torpedoes a number of fundamental economic assumptions, and then promises to lay out a history of the institution. I was left with the feeling that if I persevered through all 544 pages a great secret would be revealed, an Eleusinian Mystery of sorts. The second half didn't quite fulfill on this promise, but that doesn't change the fact that anyone interested in politics OR economics OR being human should probably read this book.<br /><br />Insights include Graeber's attack on the \\"myth of barter.\\" Generally, economic theories assume that money arose to deal with the fact that barter was awkward. Debt argues that barter societies never really existed, and that credit and virtual money always dominated human interactions before the arrival of coinage (roughly 600 BC). This I buy 100%. In my readings about the pre-coinage ancient world (mostly Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia) it has long been clear to me that \\"money\\" existed, if only on paper (achem... clay tablet). Heck, writing, and therefore history itself, was invented as a tool to record debts. The earliest documents are all ledgers: \\"so-and-so owes the temple fifteen chickens and thirty-two bushels of grain\\" and that sort of thing. Early civilizations usually converted productions into one or more virtualized \\"money\\" currencies, like bushes of grain (not so coincidentally called shekels!). Few lugged piles of grain or weights of silver around with them, they merely agreed to the common value of various goods in these units. Therefore: money!<br /><br />Graeber makes mind opening points about the relationship between debt, money (which is often about exact measurement of debt), the state, and human politics and freedoms. States were/are fundamentally military and money exists in no small part as an expediency to supply the army. He questions again and again the assumption that \\"everyone should pay their debts\\" and points out that really translates to \\"everyone should pay their debts unless they are holding the gun.\\" This leads to tackling and exploring the conditions that lead to that most unpleasant and also long-lived of human traditions: slavery. His discussion of the relationship between \\"human context\\" and the lack of it being a prerequisite for chattel slavery is alone worth the price of admission.<br /><br />He also explores the incredible tie between debt and morality. Our relationship with God is usually even couched in credit terms: reckoning, redemption, and so on.<br /><br />Much of the middle of the book explores four big periods of history. 1) the pre-coinage credit kingdoms of the remote ancient world 2) the axial empires of middle antiquity (600BC - 600AD) 3) the middle ages and 4) the modern imperialist era. He points out that these periods oscillate between credit and bullion based economies. He also argues that we have recently moved into a new 5) credit economy. I'm not, myself, sure that the current period isn't more of an evolution of the imperialist/capitalist stage, but anyway.<br /><br />However, Graeber is not without bias. He appears to despise the coinage ages and glorify the credit based ones while I see things as more of a progression. He is perhaps right that the \\"axial age\\" (600BC - 600AD) was dominated by bullion/military/slavery economics and a tremendous scale of warfare. But he seems to ignore the subsistence living of the prior and middle ages and the wild cultural and population growth allowed by the expanding axial economy. He seems to have a love affair with the middle ages, particularly in their Eastern incarnation (read the Caliphate period). Don't get me wrong, I have a bit of an Arabian Nights fetish myself, but this was not a time and place free of human misery. Far better that Western Europe during the dark ages, sure, but we all knew that (or should have).<br /><br />In the later stages of the book, when discussing the Imperialist and modern eras, Graeber remains fascinating, but grows a bit confused and political (in the sense of having an axe to grind as opposed to discussing politics, which are, after all, fundamental to the work). I'm not sure where he leaves us, in our world of debt imperialism and mandatory expansion, but he certainly provides tremendous food for thought. His is a keen mind that resists carving culture, history, and all that into neat little bundles. Civilization is a messy knot. More scale, more people, bigger cities, bigger armies, it all requires infrastructure. Resources must be moved, systems must be invented, the machinery of state and the greed of individuals must be fed. Where does it all end? Who owes whom?<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dreamias. He appears to despise the coinage ages and glorify the credit based ones while I see things as more of a progression.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie was fantastic! Everyone says that books are better than their movie-remakes which is usually very true and while this movie did not hit on a few things I felt it was an extremely close representation of the book.  One of the best things is the actors in it- I have become a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence from this and other movies she has done.  This is mainly because her ability to play a serious role while being a huge goofball off camera makes me really respect her talent (want an example? Check out her interview on The Letterman Show). You'll really enjoy this even if you haven't read the book!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I think this game is awesome. I just wish you get coins for every mile you go and everytime you beat yyour record. I wish the car were cheaper and you get double coins for killing not one. make the game better.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Christopher Hitchens was one of the increasingly rare breed, the public intellectual. During his terminal illness he wrote about his experience of his own mortality and his pen had lost none of its wit, vigor, and sharpness. He was a very public atheist for many years and deals with well-meaning religious of various stripes who are intent on \\"saving his soul\\" before his demise. He maintains his humor throughout his ordeal and documents the grisly struggle with the medical industry while dying of esophageal cancer. He says kind things about MD Anderson cancer center in Houston, Texas. Last fall, I had the privilege of hearing Hitchens speak in one of his last public appearances at the American Atheist Alliance in Houston. He was dead by mid-December of 2011.<br /><br />Read the book. It is insightful, witty, and --oddly-- hopeful.

He also is a great storyteller, as you get drawn into what seems like an impossible tale, set in Southern California back in the riotus 60's. It is always a delight to read his books, but this one is my new favorite.

So understanding how to make concepts and ideas more compelling and, importantly, how to get people to remember and act on them is key to what I do. This book is filled with practical advice and examples to help those of us who must communicate well in both speaking and writing. The fact is, with so many messages, it is the presentation and delivery rather than the content that \\"hooks\\" people.  This book gives great advice and techniques to help presenters have the best chance possible of being heard and remembered.

Although the chase scenes were very well done. The acting was very good and Brad Bird's directing was excellent. There was even a nod to Cal Arts classroom A113, which I thought was awesome. Definitely worth watching.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show went beyond my expectations. So many twists and turns that it kept me totally engaged. Homeland is thrilling, yet undenyably scary because of the world we live in today. Theatrics aside, it makes one question whether this can happen in the U.S.? I cannot wait until the next season comes out on Amazon.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This is a very good book. The information has led to being able to adopt a dramatically different diet with great results, and we are eating better tasting food than we ever have. I have lost enough weight that I now weigh what I weighed when I graduated from high school in 1969! The only criticism I have is that the author, like many authors, implies that this is the ONE thing we should do to be healthy, and life is more complicated than that. But it is an IMPORTANT thing to do, along with eliminating high fructose corn syrup, exercising, developing mindfulness habits, establishing strong and supportive relationships, etc.

B00943SQCI|5.0|Disclaimer up front:  I love Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  In my opinion, they make a fabulous team!  Tim Burton is dark and quirky and Depp has ability to pull off even the srangest of characters and make them come alive for the viewer.  I also have never seen the TV show.  I didn't even know there was a TV show until a couple weeks ago.<br /><br />With that in mind, I have to say that while Dark Shadows isn't my absolute favorite of Burton and Depp's work, it definitely a classic Burton movie and well worth the money.  The visuals are dark and fascinating.  The costumes are as beautiful as always.  The actors are just quirky enough to make the charater interesting and make the viewer feel empathetic towards the character.  The script was very funny.  My friend and I laughed throughout the whole movie.  In the interest of disclaimers, we do have more of a Burton sense of humor so we were laughing at some things that other people were not.  However, the movie gained quite a few laughs from the other viewers in the theater.  If you love the typical creative Burton set style, costumes, and script, I truly believe you will love this movie.  I was a little disappointed in Alice just because, to me, it still came across as too Disney so this Burton movie felt like coming home and seeing a long lost friend all at once!
B009329ZF2|4.0|I am amazed that the movie reviews were so low on this movie.  There wasn't too much reference to the game but I thought it was a great movie
B00498TQV8|5.0|This film is so honest and simple. But at the same time it's wrapped in this complex and little known world that resides in this dark, yet altruistic American subculture. The writing and direction manage to carry the movie through the slower, more visually stunning transitions. Jennifer Lawrence proves again in her role here that she is destined to by one of Hollywood's greatest. John Hawkes carries his role impressively, delivering his best performance yet!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It gets a little redundant after a while It is easy so you don't get over whelmed by it. Fun Though
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I was so excited for Snow White & The Huntsman to come out; not because of Stewart and her Twilight involvement, but for the simple fact that the trailer looked amazing.  I should have stuck with the trailer.  The costumes and cinetography are as beautiful as the trailer would have you believe but the acting and script are subpar.  I would watch it again but only with the mute button on and if we can skip Stewart's classic and always there \\"oh no.  What should I do?\\" face.  Even when she rides to battle and is supposed to be a strong heroine, she has her \\"I'm conflicted\\" face on.  I think I may hate her as the heroine even more than the script.  By the end of the movie, I was bored and secretly wanted the Snow White to die again just to spice up the movie.

B005ZCXPP0|4.0|While some of the Marvel superhero films don't do a great job of adhering to the source material, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) does better than most, as it succeeds in capturing to a large degree, the spirit of the comics which saw the genesis of the character during World War II.  The film features Captain America battling his greatest and most ruthless adversary, Red Skull, the personification of Nazi cunning and fighting spirit, and the leader of the Third Reich's secret weapons branch.<br /><br />In superhero movies, setup and character origins typically eat up a nice chunk of time in the initial film.  That is somewhat true here, but the process is streamlined by Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the future Captain America, not having a complicated backstory, and the action being set in the already familiar setting of World War II.<br /><br />The year is 1942, and a patriotic Steve Rogers has once again been classified 4F, and rejected by the army.  Recruited by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), the scrawny Rogers finds himself in uniform, as a volunteer in a top secret experimental program to develop an enhanced fighting man.  The process is successful, as Rogers becomes a muscular specimen, but when Erskine is assassinated, the secret of the process is lost.<br /><br />Instead of an army of supersoldiers, there is just Rogers, and as the costumed \\"Captain America\\" he is used mainly as a public relations tool for the red, white, and blue.  Under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), Rogers is in Italy entertaining the troops, when he learns that his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been reported missing, while battling German forces led by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving).  With the help of British intelligence agent Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), Rogers embarks on an unauthorized rescue mission.<br /><br />Dressed as Captain America, Rogers frees Barnes and other American soldiers being held prisoner.  Schmidt the leader of a force of specially trained HYDRA agents, reveals himself as Red Skull, a man who has aspirations that exceed even Hitler's.  Rogers puts together a strike force, and sets out to destroy all of HYDRA's forces, leading to a dramatic final battle with Red Skull, and setting the stage for Captain America's appearance in The Avengers (2012).<br /><br />With World War II as the canvas against which the action takes place, Captain America: The First Avenger successfully captures some of the spirit of the comics, while adding a ton of high-tech enhancements.  There isn't much time devoted to character development, as director  Joe Johnson focuses on keeping things moving, and making the second half of this darkly atmospheric fantasy, as action oriented as possible.<br /><br />Although the war becomes a complete parody, borrowing from films like Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America is still one of the better Marvel adaptations to date.  With a rating of 4.5 stars, don't miss this one while it is available on Amazon Prime.force of specially trained HYDRA agents, reveals himself as Red Skull, a man who has aspirations that exceed even Hitler's.

B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is good when you are a first time player like me. when you begin I tells you how to play as you play you get more in to it.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory never disappoints.  A perfect blend of fiction and non fiction brings you into her world of past royal times and a perfect portrait of human nature. Love, betrayal,luxury, beauty and power. Men define themselves as returning  war heroes or dying on the battlefield, but women always showing the true strength.  Entertaining and well paced, realizing you are disappointed when it ends, yet satisfied.  Only later do you realize it also left you thoughtful.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I bought this DVD when it was first released and whenever my nephews came to visit, it was the first thing they wanted to watch.  I finally gave them the DVD as a \\"gift\\" but, I missed seeing it myself.  So I purchased another one just for me!  Even though parts of it are somewhat violent, this is a real feel-good movie for all underdogs of the world.  I never tire of watching it and I am a grandmother!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I am enjoying \\"Jet Pack Joy Ride\\". The different levels are quite entertaining.  I like collecting the coins and checking out all the items @ \\"the store\\". I will continue playing the ga me and see where it may \\"jet me to!\\" Thanks.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Like Mr. Ripley this a bizarre and dark character ......i lovethis book and it's much better than he American movie.
0756407125|5.0|I enloyed this book as much as I enjoyed The Name of The Wind.  I like the writing.  I like the characters.  I like the story. I do sincerely hope the author comes through in the end and does a good job of tying up the loose threads and finishing the tale in a satifying manner.
B004X75RK4|5.0|This is a really great movie! I've seen it before and I made my boyfriend watch it this past weekend, and he complained at first, but then he saw how funny it was and actually enjoyed it. Not overly sappy, which makes it more enjoyable for those who aren't huge romance fans. I would highly recommend this movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed both seasons of Downton Abbey.  It is also great to have them available in my video library.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book really ties together many of the relationships of previous books. It also gives you insight as to how many of these 'games' started. It is a very real depictuion of the brutality of human against human back in those days long ago.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Without this application life would be very difficult on trying to operate this device. This is a must have for any device!
B008D28HYS|4.0|great app if you have a tablet, good app if you have a smartphone.  The higher level puzzles are very difficult on a small screen.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Fifty Shades Freed is a must read if you made it through the first 2 books of the trilogy.  It continues to be a good read if you can stand the repetitious explicit sex.  It definitely has its moments.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Didn't think the book would end the way it did.  Interesting story about 2 people who pretended to be someone else to please the other person.  At the end, they are stuck with the situation they created for themselves.
B009329Y30|3.0|I could have been sooo good! The movie left a lot out - The Acting was Disappointing... but a good story since I read the book...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like that I can compare verses with different Bibles.  Also it is very easy to navigate from Book to Book within this program.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|This movie concentrates on an elderly Baroness Thatcher with flashbacks to her glory years as PM.  Not terribly accurate at times. Is is likely that the Iron Lady would have so many regrets now when she seemingly had non during those years of civil unrest and cutbacks in Tory governed Britain?  When she was powerful she steamed ahead and mowed everything in her path...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story keeps you wanting to read more about Christian and why he had become the way he was.  It made you wonder if he could change and was he willing to change; but not completely.  It will make you think about your own dark side, if there is one.  I was totally obsessed with the book(s) and could not put them down until I read all three books.  I thought it was one of the most wonderful love stories.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I'd say it was one of her better books about Dr. Tempe Brennan. Some not so good as this. Kept my interest so much I found myself reading past the time I usually go to bed. If you want a good read this is it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This whole game is worth $7.00 it has creative mode and survival mode prefer survival mode, but really BUY THIS GAME.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book! Well written and it an easy read. It is like no other book out there, it pushs the boundries with sex and lust and intimatimacy.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I really did enjoy this book. I find it hard to create a \\"title\\" for my review, though. The book is similar to \\"Turn of Mind\\" (also excellent) in that the narrator does not know much about her life, and often has to re-learn what the reader already knows, and does a good job of that without feeling repetitive. Unlike Turn of Mind, however, the protagonist in this book is not experiencing a degenerating disease and so her thoughts are always contemplative and cohesive (vs TOM in which the protagonist is sometimes quite confused and rambling).<br /><br />The book is told in the first person, and each morning is a \\"new day\\" for her. Much of the book is told journal style (i.e., documenting what just happened in the morning but the afternoon is yet to come), with a little bit in the here and now, as it's happening. It keeps the reader in tune with what she is going through, and also helps the reader piece together bits of her life. There is enough foreshadowing that a savvy reader could guess the ending, but it is still a good ending, appropriate for the story and characters, and ties things together while still leaving the reader to think a bit. I am not sure if this condition is at all plausible, but it certainly makes for a good story. I found the book well paced and the character development well thought out and captivating. I have recommended this book to several friends.
B008XG1X18|1.0|So far I do not care for the app.  Although I do enjoy Pintrest, so I hope you fix it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I cannot wait to read the other two books! I couldn't put it down read it in less than a week! :-)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the complex and visually intriguing subtly leading to the surprising ending. Descriptions and characters were completely believable and<br />compelling. Graphic by nature but fun.
B0034DGP6S|3.0|Committed has nothing of the intense energy and heightened emotion of Gilbert's previous book, Eat Pray Love.<br />Although quite interesting in it's historical account of marriage and some thoughtful musings about the institution in today's context, I found it unfortunately dry and dull by comparison to her amazing and spiritual bestseller.<br />It is a worthwhile read for anyone who is married. While her last book was perhaps more universal, Committed feels like a much more narrow account, and a little neurotic :(
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is not a book I likely would have picked up on my own, but a good friend recommended it, as it was her book group's choice of the month.  I was not familiar with the author (apologies, Mr. Cline), and when I read the book's description, I was not terribly enthused.  A book about a boy who devotes his entire life to playing video games?  Seriously?  Hell, yes; seriously!  Start to finish, I absolutely loved it.  The main characters are strong, sharp, and unexpected, and all of the 80s references appealed to my inner goonie-geek.  The only tiny complaint I had about the book was the overly involved descriptions of the ever-changing setting, but it is a small con against a book that had so many pros for me. Get it, read it, love it.  I know I did.
B0087HT36U|5.0|a fun little game for wasting time. both me and my kids liked it very much I got it free but would have paid for it and would have been worth it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I ordered \\"No Easy Day\\" before it's release date and Amazon delivered it at 12:01 on the day of the release. I read it in 36 hours... This book is well written, easy reading and written from a Navy Seal's perspective of the events as they went down. The author was among those who first first entered Osama's room.<br /><br />I feel this account of events is factual and describes not only the final hours, but the events and days leading up to this mission. We owe our Military, and others, much for the safety of our great country... This book really involves the reader in the commitment that the men and women in our Military and Intelligence Agencies have made to the completion of their missions. I highly recommend \\"No Easy Day\\" to you.
6304696515|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. What great actors, director, everything. I can watch it and watch it over and over.
B007WV05GY|5.0|Loved it, great suspense and Liam Neeson is an amazing actor!!!  Would recommend it to anyone. Not for the feint of heart - especially the airplane crash scene - most real I've seen!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, especially the development of the characters. The story had many twists and turns that left the reader wanting more.
B0085776BG|5.0|Excellent rendition of the heroic actions of the black pilots during WW2.  The characters were believable and the flight scenes, while difficult the phathom so many planes in so little space, seem true to the realities of air battle.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is a convoluted story about two very disagreeable people. I am 75% through the book on my Kindle and I don't plan to finish it because so far it has gone from bad to worse and however it ends neither of them will probably get what they deserve.  I can't imagine why this book is so popular!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|looking for a new project? there is always something. to find on pintrest. from clothes to yard ornaments to house decorum. I recommend this to every one!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|By the third book, I was ready for the end.  Too much, too long, the characters too unbelievable. Very erotic, but the story was so impossible.  And the end was really too much to believe.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book, it was very different  from anything I have read.  There are twists that are very surprising and unexpected.  I hated for the story to end.
0099579944|5.0|Can't get enough of the story.  Sorry it had to end.  I loved all 3 books & have already ready them twice.  First time ready an erotic novel & WOW!  Even getting my husband to read them & he agrees WOW!  Love Christian & Anatasia and how their relationship evolved.  Extremely hard to put down.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|this software did exactly what it was supposed to. i can access my files easily and quickly on my android device.
B008578PRK|4.0|This provided a good scare - the actual woman in black was super creepy and scary but the story \\"creeped\\" along a little slow.  Some of the effects were predictable and stale, but overall I thought the premise was good and the ending was great!
B008YRVW0I|2.0|There were a lot of interruptions to buy and upgrade the product and not enough levels to fully enjoy the game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Like many others, I was really drawn in right from the start and couldn't stop reading. I enjoyed the various incarnations of Amy up until she turned into a sociopath. While the author did a great job with character development, I do not think this book constitutes great writing. Yes, the author was clever, in particular with the treasure hunt, but there were too many cliches and too many twists.<br /><br />Apparently, I'm not alone in disliking the ending. For a thriller, it was drawn out and anti-climatic and left me feeling very unsatisfied.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The subtle love triangle offset by the exceptional detail of a horrible, yet adventurous world of what government could be, kept me listening for 2 days straight.  The characters share their feelings and thoughts to the point that you are there with them just watching it happen.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Honestly, I never even knew about the original series.  So I suppose you could say I came into this with a neutral standing in terms of how I would perceive it.  I wasn't too sure about it at first, so I gave it a bit of a watch before deciding to buy it or pass.  Now I can say this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a good while.  Everything from the actors to the lines and the way they're delivered...  It all seemed to flow nicely.  There aren't so many laughs that you'll find it hard to have time to breathe, yet there aren't too few that leave you wondering if you're actually watching a comedy.  It sits perfectly in the middle all wrapped around a rather interesting and entertaining story.  There is an abundance of cussing, so be forewarned about that if it turns you away.  This movie sits very close to one of the few I'd recommend buying immediately.  However I do know that there will be some people out there who don't get much enjoyment from it.  Either way, you need to at least give it a chance by renting it or watching it in some way shape or form.  I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed if you have a general idea of what to expect.  :]
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Great game. It's addictive. It's easy to learn and has 3 levels so you can hone your skills. Plus 32 different maps and 3 different armies.
B004GYY714|1.0|I just got this based on reviews and none of the local stations are available. Not the commercial, college, or even any of the independent stations. I did get one talk radio station. Just a waste of time.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|A cracking good yarn! I'd have to say it's not brilliantly written, but it sure keeps you on your toes! There is action from woe to go, and the characters are, from the start, endearing.<br />I haven't yet finished it, but can hardly wait til the end. That, to me, is a good book.
B000I9WW6I|5.0|Do keep the kleenex nearby.  This movie was so touching on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin.  The love, friendship and unwavering faithfulness between the two young woman, as told by an elderly woman in a convalescent home, is so beautiful.  Everyone should be so fortunate to really experience this kind of friendship on the Earth.  The movie is equally beautiful with regards to the friendship that happens between the elderly woman and a middle aged married woman who is having something of a midlife crisis.  They become the best of friends, with profound mutual blessings shared between them.<br /><br />By the time the movie is over, your heart will be touched.  If it isn't, take your pulse and call for medical help if necessary.  Furthermore, you might find yourself with a vague desire to move South.  You will probably also make and eat fried green tomatoes for the first time in your life.  I had them this morning for breakfast and I never would have ever thought of eating such a thing.  Delicious (the tomatoes and the movie)  :o)
B0076NKNLA|4.0|This film lacked a little in substance and seemed slow, but we really enjoyed Michelle Williams' performance.  It was as if we were seeing Marilyn one more time.  After the movie, I decided to watch a documentary about Marilyn Monroe and it was as if she wasn't vibrant enough in her personality.  Maybe Michelle spoiled me with her imitation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have to admit it was difficult getting through a few pages but I could not put this book down. The next two books were the same way. The series were Fantastic!
B004X75RK4|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Kept me laughing from start to finish. I thought<br />Ryan Renolds and Sandra Bullock were great together. Comedy for sure, with<br />a touch of romance. Love it!
B009157BWU|5.0|I was afraid it was going to be sad, and it is - a little, but the ending more than makes up for it. Perhaps not for the very young (4-5) but any older will most certainly see the beauty of the story and its surroundings.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|In the beginning Katniss struggles with herself, she is hesitant and at times this was a little frustrating. However one needs to remember the shocking psychological mind games she has been subjected to at only 18 years of age. The second half sees more of the Katniss we have grown to admire and respect and we see her make decisions that require courage and selflessness. The final chapter is more than what I was hoping for.
B005TOW9JM|4.0|I really like this album, but its very diffent than the first album. If you really like Justice I would give it a go atleast listen to it one time though really good for excercising too.
B0090EIILU|2.0|Some of it was funny, some vulgar. Watched it once, but no more.  Would have been better without the vulgar parts.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|My kids love Angry Birds, so we got this one for my phone. It never worked; it froze up every time and we had to force shut down. I deleted it from my phone. Until it gets fixed, don't bother getting it!
B001NLKWLW|3.0|Very interesting at the start.  Gets slow 3/4ths of the way.  Strong finish.  a little confusing jumping back and forth in time.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love getting these shows on Amazon and being able to watch them in a row without waiting for weeks.  Now we have to wait for the next ones to come out!
B003NDC07M|5.0|Its a differnt mix of popand if different is what you like this is what you need. Her vocal variation is like that of Florence but with a darker tone. The in your face beats will have you bouncing as you listen . i loved evryone with an exception of the second one ,but with the delux version you have a variety of songs that you can relate to if you still have that \\"who am i \\" thought. \\"Obsession and \\" oh no ARE MY PRIDE AND JOY:3
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is awesome---HBO does it again. I watched every episode of Sex and City way back when and I have not been this excited over a TV show sense then.  Amazon needs to carry Season 2...
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Unusual film. Good acting, good script,good performances around. Hard time deciding on three stars or four. Gave it four for the unusual subject matter.
B00499NHLC|5.0|TV has now surpassed film for the telling great stories with in-depth characters.  I highly recommend this series as compelling, interesting and exciting.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Beautifully written novel centered on the lunacy of WW1 and the cataclysmic changes wrought in Europe and the US as a result.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So far this book is very intense.  Got to stay with it because still don't know where it is headed.
0395389496|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beautiful book but ALSO that it included a CD and a medalion to hand on the Christmas tree because it is celebration time. This was at no additional charge.
B00932IHGK|4.0|I really like the series and look forward to the next season.  The plot works well, the cast is great, and each episode ends in a way that makes you anxious for the next one.
B008D28HYS|3.0|I really like Cross Me Color, but I prefer the original Cross Me. While it is easy to comprehend the differences between the two, the Cross Me Color games are much more difficult with the colors starting and ending next to each other. Don't get me wrong, it is fun and challenging. But sometimes I like to play to have fun and not think so much. If you're looking for a more advanced/difficult game, this one is right for you. If you're just looking for fun, original Cross Me is much better.
B005MLP91C|4.0|This is a great movie for kids and yourself. Worth having on your Kindle Fire. We purchased it for when we travel.
B00005N6KG|3.0|On August 15, 2012 I purchased 2 Maxell Stereo Head Buds and 3 Sony MDR W08L earphones. I use earphones a lot when I walk my dogs, use the treadmill in the gym or work in the garden: Nothing \\"stressful\\" as far as earphones go. The prices for both products were excellent, and there was no shipping charge. I have used both products in the past. The Sony usually lasted for one year before the connecting wires in one of the earphone got loose and the sound was no longer stereophonic. The Maxell  lasted longer.<br /><br />The difference between the two products from the very start was clear: Sony has a superior quality sound (especially for Classical music--where quality really counts), Maxell was of noticeably LESSER quality--good for speech, less-than- great for music.<br /><br />This time, one of the Sony earphones' wires went out TWO WEEKS after I purchased the product. I tried one of the Maxells, only to find that, at least in one of the two I had purchased, the right earphone had virtually no sound.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Neither product has adequate quality controls. The difference is that Sony gives you 30 days LIMITED WARRANTY, while Maxell gives you LIFETIME warranty (although I wouldn't take THAT too seriously...)<br /><br />So, the price is right, but is the quality comparably adequate? I don't think so.
B00846REIS|1.0|I couldn't even finish the book.  It's a rip off of Fifty Shades without the humor or the affection the characters have for each other, which is a major part of Fifty's success.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Definitely anot page-turner. Disnt think it was possible, but I liked itit even better than the first book! An amazing (and hot) love story.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was a very interesting yet easy read. Although the premise of the book (and perhaps the marketing) is directed toward the end climax, it speaks to much more than that. It humanized the Navy Seal, this fighting force that we often think of more machine than man. It explores the deep conflict and challenges these men face in their day to day world and the struggles when they return to normal society. I liked this book for that reason and found the climax to be just another day in the life of man doing his job. It was more human than not and there was no hype, just a really good read
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome! I can't get my mind of of it. for parents it is good because your kids can join each others world and play together.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Interesting read....very informative...if this version is correct I don't understand why the government had to fabricate a different story, this version seems fine to me. it's a testament to our special forces that a mission like this can even be considered. job well done
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've always been a Nicholas Sparks fan.  I decided to read the book after I heard they were filming the movie near my hometown of Wilmington, NC.  It did not disappoint..  It was great - I loved the story line and cant wait for the movie to come out.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|This is a great movie. I learned so much about Bob I never knew. I am so glad I added this to my movie collection. It is something I will watch over and over. ONE LOVE
B0087HT36U|4.0|Its a awesome take on the siege war game type. I love the first person view. it runs fine on the kindle fire
B007SSDDWE|1.0|The movie itself was OK, probably a 3.  Different take on the alien invasion theme.  We have our HD movies run thru our Sony to our big screen tv.  Sadly, we won't be purchasing anymore HD movies thru Amazon as for whatever reason the quality is not good.  It really does not look anywhere close to HD.  The last movie we tried to order HD we quit viewing 5 minutes into it and purchased on Dishnetwork and it was much better.  I love Amazon but sadly there is a problem with us watching HD movies thru them.  The regular movies actually look better than the HD.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great character development, excellent flow of story, edge-of-your-seat suspense, incredible imagination.  Couldn't put it down and can't wait for the next one!!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Northanger Abbey is one of the earliest books written by Jane Austin. Literary Critics usually contend that this book is definitely not up to snuff with her later writings.  However, I have always loved it.  The characters are hilarious, and it is a sweet romance.
0393088774|1.0|Paul Krugman couldn't be more off base in his economic assessment.  Unfortunately for him, time will prove him wrong as his analysis of where we are and where we should go are based on false premises.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|I highly recommend having a Prime membership. I got to rent this movie for my daughter and it's the cutest movie. If your child loves cat's this movie is for them.
B0013O123Q|4.0|What a movie. I hadn't even heard anything about this movie before queuing it up on Streaming. Started the movie rolling and wasn't aware of what to expect. I didn't even read the summary prior to watching! So the opening comes out being straight up weird and was just a spinning camera flying around almost giving me motion sickness. Actually debated whether to stop watching. Thankfully, I didn't. As the spinning camera style does start to slow down while the movie progresses. The kooky scene with the old man also ends rather quickly. And then comes the fire extinguisher scene. The fire extinguisher scene was incredibly realistic. Almost too realistic. And the movie is just as twisted the longer it goes. So hang in there!<br /><br />So, the story of the film is shown in reverse order. Personally, I liked it that way as seeing how these events come to form really forces you to pay attention and link all the who's, what's, where's, etc... together. And as the story shapes up, the details start to reveal a far more normal picture than you would have originally thought. That is what makes this movie so brutal. The beginning pieces. After the ending (or beginning?) has been realized, this is the point that really hits close to home.<br /><br />So I am an avid horror/thriller/B-movie watcher and I wasn't as broken up over the movie as some reviewers. So if you are someone who had trouble making it through a movie like HOSTEL, you will most definately have trouble watching this movie. And for those that are just annoyed with the opening 'shaky' camera style, wait! It becomes less and less throughout the film. And if you can hang in there through those minimally annoying details, you will get to watch an excellent show!
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best app i have ever got! its so addicting and fun! seriously this isnt a advertisment. no one is paying me to say this. one time i accedently deleted it then i imeadiatly got it again. also its free so if you dont like it its all good. no waste of money. however dont get brave temple run. its a complete waste of money. it costs and is super slow. take it from me. im the app queen.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I first read \\"Run\\" by Blake Crouch and loved it.  I love this one too and will read more from this author.  Along the lines of Koontz.  Exciting and well written.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|We rented this movie for 48 hours on my Kindle Fire for my daughter. It was so funny and a life saver for the days she had to come to work with me.
1400064627|4.0|I had to know if the character played by Jessica Tandy in the movie was Idgie. I'm not telling. I was also surprised to find the differences between the movie version and the book. I wish the screen writer had followed the book. Worth reading if you've only seen the film.
0385344333|1.0|we have been Reacher fans from the beginning but this book was most disappointing. it did not live up to the hype on the dust jacket and the plot stunk--i kept waiting for something to happen, for the Reacher we love to bring the plot alive.  Lee Child did a disservice to a great character. and what the heck did the title have to do with anything?  come on Lee, you can write a much better Reacher novel.
B008KPIN9C|5.0|The Bloom and the Blight doesn't feel quite as polished as some of their other stuff... It's a bit heavier and grittier sound to both the vocals and the guitar, they seemed to use a little more distortion on this album which really works well.  Great album from a great band, I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|This was a great book, it felt like something more was going on but you just couldn't work out what ! This book is very well written and keeps you guessing, fantastic well worth a read......
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Bought this USB GPS puck to work with my laptop and APRSPoint.  It works great in my car just putting the puck on the dashboard.  It also works when I have the system setup in my basement, but it gives position errors over about 30-40 meters.  This is when I put the puck up to a basement window which faces north.  I didn't expect the unit would work in the basement, so I'm happy that it does work at all.<br />Overall I'm highly satisfied with this unit.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you want the actual facts of what went down in the process of getting Osama bin Laden without the media and government hype, then this is the book for you. It also gives a great account of the work and sacrifice these men go through every day to keep us safe at home.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I got this for my husband who owned all the original DVDs and he is so much happier with the Blu-ray discs. Picture is so much better!! Big plus for us is everything is one package so we didn't have to have 6 different Blu-ray cases.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love the prizes<br />just like playing at chuck e cheese<br />love the different levels and challenges to be played. could play all day
B001P5M7QE|5.0|This is one of my ten favorite comedies of all time. So many funny quotes. From the French guy in the Castle to Lancelot killing the father of the Bride in the wedding scene I laugh every time I watch it.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I agree with all the reviewers who have given this novel a positive review.  It's very good, and sets up the anticipation for the third and final novel in the series.<br /><br />I've been waiting impatiently for its release for months.  My only negative comment is that it's a little too long, particularly at the end, when the novel didn't conclude at an obvious point, either the Berlin Airbridge or the Soviet detonation of their first nuclear bomb.<br /><br />I disagree with all the commentators who have complained about the price and given it 1 star, without reading it.  I think $20 for an eBook, particularly of this length and quality is quite reasonable.  I'm definitely going to read it again, although probably as an Audiobook.<br /><br />One slight confession ...  I haven't actually read the novel either.  I preordered it months ago.  I also preordered the German translation at a different time - so on September 18, both appeared on my iPad.  Some time or another I'll get around to reading the original English version, to compare it to the German translation, which was very good.<br /><br />Publishers need to be encouraged to release eBooks, particularly their back catalogue.  With eBooks, books should never be out of print.  Now ... If only the publisher owning the rights to WF Saint's 'Memoirs of an Invisible Man' (which appears to be Amazon's most favorite out of print book) would release an eBook version, I'd buy it immediately, to replace my second hand hardcover copy.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I think this movie adaptation was very good.  There were very few things that I disliked about how they interpreted this.  Watching this movie got my sister interested in the books so if you are not sure about whether you want to read the books give this movie a try.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|This sucked it wants to give platform for solicitation of services not needed or desired would be better without the sales pitches to be able just to play.
B004X4QW42|4.0|I couldn't play it on my x-box but I loved it when I was able to view on my DVD Player.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much, I intend to put this author on my \\"watch for\\" list. Highly recommended author!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I thought this season of Dexter was quite good.  I think if you are thinking about buying this then you already know what you want.  This season is much better than season 5.
B009329Y30|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it was a great love story and I also liked the military story that went with it
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I've read all of the Jack Reacher books, and a few look-alikes, and while A Wanted Man was very enjoyable, I had been looking forward to it for some time, it just wasn't up to the standard of the earlier books.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|After spending a little time with this game, I found it to be quite enjoyable. I look forward to allowing my children to play it because it's definitely also very educational.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|The author sets such a wonderful mood with her rich descriptions that the reader can feel, touch and taste the events as they unfold. It is uncanny how Kate Morton can bring the reader into a work of fiction in such a realistic way. I have read three of her works and cannot wait for more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A real life account of the mission as told buy an actual seal that participated in the mission . It leads up to the missions preperation and training in the words of a seal that was in the forfront of the operation , with the actual feelings and perspectives of the seals that took part . Of course our judiciary system is out to usually prosicute and harass anyone that tells the actual truth that sheds light on the scripted political story that is put out for our exploitation . It would be very interesting reading for anyone interested in the true rendition of how the mission really played out and who the real heros are . The political rendition put out for our consumption is the only hearesy connected with this heroic mission giving the bulk of the credit to people at the white house who observed ONLY while siting in a nice warm safe place as usual . The realization is damning
B009329ZF2|5.0|I always appreciate a clean, original, quality action movie. And that's exactly what Battleship is.  A solid movie, good acting, good special effects, good plot. For the most part family friendly, some light profanity and the aliens might scare some younger kids. I'm very picky about the cleanliness of whatever my family watches, and I must say for an action movie they did a good clean job.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Some of the best straight up rock I've heard in a while. It's been a long time since I've heard a record this solid.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked it but I thought it was a bit slow. Not sure I would recommend it strongly to others.
B00846REIS|5.0|Could not put this book down.  I got so wrapped up in the characters! It was just as good as Fifty Shades!  Can not wait until the next book is released!!!
B008JTK9NW|5.0|I love it when you can take music and speak to a generation of people, reach someone where they are at, and praise Gods name all at the same time this album rocks!!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I am stuck finishing this series just to see how it ends, but this is one of the worst books I have read. The author needs to purchase a thesaurus and stop cut and pasting sections of the book. What I mean is, the author uses the same words and descriptions for multiple events. I would say the first book was ok for it's shocking descriptions and interesting characters, however, books 2 and 3 are just painful to read. I actually find myself \\"rolling my eyes\\" at the mundane and lazy mind of author E.L. James. If I could go back in time and never read this series, I would.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|I don't get what everyone is complaining about. The graphics are just like Mario Mart, the controls are easy enough that my six year old figured it out, you can tilt to play if you turn on the accelerometer in game settings, and yes it's only one level... BUT IT'S FREE. I'll be buying the full version.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am not sure if Mockinjay was as good as Catching Fire, but if not it comes close. I don't think Suzanne Collins could have ended the trilogy any better, and there is a beautiful twist in the story that I just did not see coming. A fitting end to the books that kept me going from beginning to end.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Cheap, but very addictive fun.  The green pigs can drive you crazy on some of the levels before you get through the level. Great way to kill some time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think these games are challenging. they make you think fast and need to make good and reasonable estimates. I love this game but isn't perfect
B008LY5VHE|5.0|If you need a movie to give your kids a good scare from a classic or you need a go-to because nothing else is on, or you need the stuffing scared out of you one more time, \\"Jaws\\" fits the bill every time.<br />  There is nothing, no demon, no ghost, & no chainsaw wielding vengeance seeker that can compare with the first fifteen minutes of \\"Jaws\\". After thirty-some odd years, this is still my top rated scary movie. An absolute must-see!
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Holy crux I love smashing, shooting,electrifying and blowing up mutants and this game delivers all of the above with great graphics and lots of Gore to boot!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although this book is aimed at a teen audience, I loved this book. It was one of those books you can not put down - a one sit read, I call them. The charcters were true to the persona the author created and the plot took one turn after another, making it something that was both entertaining and unpredictable.A good read for book lovers of any age.[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|Good story. Good read.  Harry Hole is a oddly flawed character who is totally fascinating.  The author knows has written a story that continues to unfold right up to the last page.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Enjoyed the game immensely.  Puzzles were pretty challenging--had to use the walkthrough several times, but it was still enjoyable.  Looking forward to The Haunt 2.
B0078JP5SS|5.0|This was a great show. The acting is superb, costumes wonderful and an interesting time of life that I did not know much of the history.  I have become a fan of watching these continuous shows one night after the next.  I hate the idea now that I need to wait till January for next season.  It is like watching a movie when you purchase the episodes and watch one after the next.<br />I am a fan.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was unexpectedly engaging.  The ending was interesting, but I believe was left open for sequels, a possible explanation.  However, this book combines several genres, including mystery and fantasy, which elevates the interest level.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, I felt like I was on the PCT with her, she brings you in every careless, carefree, crazy moment she has. What an amazing journey.
B007SSEU9O|3.0|As usual, a great acting performance by Merryl Streep, but I found the story and plot rather boring. History buffs will probably like it.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|This product allows for seamless sharing of files.  I use it all the time and encourage others to do the same.
B009329Y30|5.0|Wonderful movie, It shows the heartfelt love of family, love & romance, pain & sorrow, comedy, hope and much much more. Well written, directed and the actors were amazing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great book that gives insight into the selection process and life of Navy Seals as well as the other components of the US military serving within the special operations community. It does  an excellent job of telling the story of one man's  career but, by extension, tells the life of all his comrades.  It is written at the 8th grade level to allow adolescents the ability to understand and perhaps become  inspired by the lives of modern day heroes.  While the book does a good job of telling the story of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, an undercurrent of the sorry is the motivation, teamwork, and brotherhood of those who fight our nation's wars.  While some details of the story are new, what the author effectively does is piece together the story from already disclosed sources in a manner that allows the reader an opportunity to get a clear picture of the mission from the viewpoint of someone who was on the ground.  I would heartily recommend this book to young people interested in the military, current members of the armed forces, and the general public who are interested in the life of soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen during the last decade of war.  It is more than a book about the operation that killed bin Laden.  It is a story about the sacrifices and dedication of the men and women who serve.
B007N85POS|5.0|The great game, yet challenging, It's like eating a potatoe chip once you start you can't stop if you all know what I mean. I have all the Big Bird games and love them all.
B0091XRTTM|3.0|Pirates is a good movie if you're a kid but for adults it can all be a little silly. The basic plot is that Pirate Captain(that's his name!) has entered the Pirate of the Year competition. Unfortunately he is a terrible pirate. But when he attacks Charles Darwin's ship Darwin realizes that Captain's parrot is really the last living Dodo Bird and wants to steal it for Queen Victoria. What follows is mostly screwball type comedy with occasional pop culture references. It's not bad, just not great. My advice is to wait till you can watch it for free.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are interested in Military history, read a first hand account written by one of the men involved.  The Navy seals are highly trained professionals and this book will give you a glimpse of what was involved in the mission to kill Bin Laden.  If you are an Obama worshipper, be warned that this book shows him and his staff to be uninformed about our military and extremely slow in his decision making.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I am not very pleased with this game.  The series of letter given make it almost impossible to construct interesting words.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|For the life of me, I don't understand all the hype about this book. The writing is very immature, sounds like it's written by a middle-school student.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was fairly close to the book, The quality of the movie using Amazon Prime was very good. I think pricing for rental could be a little less expensive and the time of rental extended - then I would rent a lot more movies.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author did a great job writing this book. The descriptions were great. The feeling of crashing in the helicopter was so detailed. He made you feel like you were right there. Thank you for the courage to write this book and the service to our country.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|AMAZING BOOK!  I wish that I could go back and read this book again and again.  The descriptions are vibrant and enticing.  The story line is compelling.  I even loved the ending.  Strong characters, beautiful imagery, and an easy read.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is her best album . every song is good. and are all catchy. i give this album 5 stars
B006LSZECO|2.0|A story that has many twists and turns and keeps your interest piqued. However, the ending is a shock and totally anti-climactic.
B004FGMV0W|2.0|This is probably her worst album. the only good song on it is \\"smile\\" this is probably a waste of money
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I thought I was going to just love this movie, but not so much. Everybody else I've spoken to says it's a great movie and they really enjoyed it.
B000066NW0|3.0|I bought this album for the song \\"complicated\\" then after awhile the song got annoying. so eventually the cd broke and i didnt care haha
B009329ZF2|1.0|This movie was horrible. I love mindless action as much as the next guy but damn. If Michael Bay were dead he would be rolling over in his grave. The story is non-existent. Acting is bad. Directing was all over the place. People keep making comparisons to transformers, but I do not think this is a fair comparison for transformers. It at least has a antagonist who talks throughout the movie and has an agenda. The invaders here have no real motivation and never speak or even make you dislike them at all. Save you money and watch an Armageddon rerun. It is a masterpiece of mindless action. This movie is just a piece of ____.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I usually go for thriller books but decided to read this trilogy because there was so much buzz about it. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I am on book 2 & love it. Yes there a LOT of sex but there is also a great story. I would definitely recommend this trilogy.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Ive always loved the free version of Angry Birds so when then ad free came up as a Free Deal of the Day, I downloaded it.  It is wonderful not having to worry about hitting the ad by accident or one of my kids touching it.  Makes the game that much more enjoyable!
0345803485|5.0|I work in publishing and ended up reading this series because it is such a phenomenon and the topic of many conversations.  I was another a romance reader and had never read erotica.  I was captivated by the story and frankly educated by the rest.  For entertainment and escapism, I highly recommend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It makes pinning so much easier and fun. I am addicted!!! All pinners should download this app, you won't be disappointed.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A good version with more variations than the Windows PC version.  The screen view of what's available does change when the Kindle is rotated.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this first hand account and would highly recommend it. Fascinating information that I didn't know about the military.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|It's a great video and comes in handy when I need my daughter to chill out while mom does shopping! Just love the movie and can't wait till the minons have their own movie out soon!!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is one of my favorite Grisham books because he exercises his considerable wit in the description of a depraved legal enterprise.<br /><br />A class action claim becomes an irresistible force for two of his most morally deplorable characters ever. A great contrast is set between these two slime-ball veterans of the ambulance chasing world and an idealistic young attorney who decides to really help a victim's family. Grisham skillfully tells a modern day parable about the damages of greed and the ultimate reward of courage if not heroism.<br /><br />As always with John Grisham, The Litigators is a really good read!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and I still think it's great. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy it.  My wife knows nothing about football and she loved it.
B00258SS72|5.0|Perfect flint eastwood film! Has action and good dualities wig a great storyline! I like how it is filnmed in the Detroit are!
B008JAGTNK|2.0|I rented this based on the good reviews and the strength of the cast in spite of knowing very little about the film. Thankfully I had a $5 credit so at least I can't say I wasted the money but it's a waste of time. It's listed as released in 2011 but filmed around 2005. Apparently issues with the director not being able to produce a final cut which lead to legal actions and eventually had the studio bring in Martin Scorsese to help with editing. In my opinion the issues showed, the flow was not there making the already LONG movie seem even longer. I never found find myself sympathizing with the main character nor was I drown into her \\"inner turmoil\\". Maybe that was the point.<br /><br />This is clearly a love it or hate it movie, not much in between. I fall well into the latter. For those who loved, great, you clearly see something in it that I don't.
B00992CF6W|5.0|plz give it back 2 me a. a a a. a a a a a a. a a a a. a a a a a a a a a. a a a a a a a. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought the book was captivating! The surprise that came halfway through the book completely through me for a loop. A good loop.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Enjoyable but predictable. A light easy read but as with most series after awhile they become mundane rather than suspenseful
B0083SBM7Q|2.0|I am severely disappointed that all of the truly great special features are blu-ray only.  This is a great movie and dvd users deserve to enjoy the same special features as the blu-ray users.  Seriously?  The dvd only has one featurette and a commentary?  That SUCKS.  I don't want to have to buy a blu-ray player, just so I can see the special features.  I know this is just entertainment, but I do feel kinda bitter about this.  I think both formats should get equal treatment.  This is very unfair to a lot of faithful customers.  I was waiting on pins and needles for this to come out, partially for the deleted scenes and gag reel.  Now, I know I'll still be missing out, after Tuesday.  Sad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once you have started on The Hunger Games, it is impossible not to go on to the other two books.  Catching Fire is as good as the first one; it's another \\"can't put it down\\" read.  The main characters are explored in more depth, and new characters are equally interesting.  In fact, I liked this book a little better than the first because of some of the new characters.
B007G92QGO|5.0|Brilliant strong characters in this book. You'll stop & think several times while reading it about what you would do in the same situation. How far would you  go to stand by your child even if you're not entirely sure they're innocent. Real moral dilema. Definitely gets you thinking.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Of course you can't stop now, you have to read the final Hunger Games book.  Thankfully, it does complete the cycle without dropping the ball.  Don't want to say more because I don't want to spoil it for others.  I was sorry when I hit the end!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|going back in time was a blast. Great love story woven into a seemingly real replay of a historic event
B009157BWU|5.0|WHAT A WONDERFUL LOVING FILM, A TESTAMENT TO WHAT WE DO TO NATURE AND HOW NATURE SHOWS US THAT NO MATTER WHAT IT WILL SURVIVE WITH OR WITH OUT US...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is something to do while u r bored.so I have something while I sit and do nothing that is how ifeel
B0090EIILU|2.0|There are a few funny parts but overall very disappointing. I love Borat and Bruno. It's not filmed the same way as those where I.e. the documentary style.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a strong young girl to go through this. She is amazing. She wrote straight from the heart. What torture. Not many people could come out of a situation like this the way she did. I would love to meet her.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I cannot believe the twists and turns of this book.  I stayed up late every single night trying to finish it.  Gillian's writing style is one I've never experienced and I love it.  I haven't been this crazy about a book since Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|My five year old grandson loves this movie. The characters have well defined personalities and the action is non stop.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This game kept my wife busy for hours. She liked it better than Angry Birds. This was one of the better FAOTD.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is a good book but I thought it was a little self-serving. Too political in a couple of instances. It's as much a story of his life as well as of the Bin Laden raid.  I would give it three stars.
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazon's presentation of the Hunger Games portrays a very real potential of what could transpire in our world in the future.  The discord and vehement rhetoric that currently exists may well portend a violent and dictatorial quest for power and control of the masses.
B000068FY0|4.0|Supertramp and the BBC go hand in hand, this album was one of the first to break out on Radio 2 and Radio 1 as a few albums did.  Radio Caroline when it was still going on a little, played this album quite substancially.  Old pens and old friends are these songs.  Dreamer is the song on this album, which we all raved about in the Seventies, it's on here,  but it is followed by the other dreamy songs ,if you go about dreaming about one-self in one-subject or another. It's all a delight with reverb and phasers which are used through the album.  You must look out for 'If Everyone was Listening', this is rather good and the other big song of Supertramp's in my opinion. There is a song about an Ayslum but is not as harrowing as the review states by Mr Wyzard.<br /><br />Singing off and letting off steam about something trampish: this is what Supertramp are good at doing.<br /><br />An album for the old boat radios if your revered them: try listening to this last of all if a collector or purchaser of all their albums. A recommended further album is 'Even in the Quietest Moments' on the same theme.
0439023521|5.0|I often do not give in to \\"fad books\\", i.e. the Twilight Series, 50 Shades of Gray, but my mom recommended this book and I caved.  I am so glad I did!  I could not put this book down once I started, and never once was I bored reading it.  Excellent read!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was great. The storyline was quite different than any other I have read and I loved how the book was written through letters.  Although I was sad to finish the book (it was so good I wanted to keep reading it!), I was satisfied with the ending.  The main character is easy to relate to and you really feel like you know him and are friends with him throughout the book.<br />I can't wait to see the movie! I hope they stay true to this fabulous story.<br />This is a MUST-READ!!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good read. I was expecting more hype with all the publicity. Enjoyable and would recommend because it provides insight as to what the men and women serving our country do everyday.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Just as you are thinking I will just read this chapter at the end of the chapter something grabs you in the last paragraph in that chapter and you have to keep going.  I have to admit I could not read this book at night because I dreamed about it all night.  Just starting the next book.
B005721W9O|4.0|I first saw the film in the theater. Unfortunately, I missed the first 20 minutes of the movie, and came in just as Tim Allen's character first showed off the real ship to his co-stars. I finally saw the whole movie a year or two later on cable. Later a friend bought it for me on DVD.<br /><br />A movie worth watching.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is painfully written. I am convinced a horny ten year old could write a better book. I suppose its entertaining enough if you have read every other book available, but I certainly do not understand the fuss!
B008B1VYP0|4.0|Starts strong but fizzles out at the end they should have reversed the tracks or something but still Adam at his best
B000FC10QG|5.0|This is a book about money and boardroom diplomacy. When the two mix, it ends up drawing greedy, needy men into something like a gold-plated bar-room brawl. It is a fascinating, readable and highly believable account of one of the largest LBO's of the 1980s.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I showed this to my environmental science class and they loved it. It really has such a great moral about the environment and is presented in fun Dr. Suess fashion.
B007IO1X5C|4.0|This is a book about the general form of some arguments that can guide us to determine the proper nature and scope of commercialism in civic society. The book is quite short and about a quarter of it (on Kindle) is footnotes. Sandel uses repeated examples to illustrate how market forces have encroached on different aspects of life and to show how two counter-arguments might point the way for further discourse. His approach is Socratic and Aristotelian: rather than present absolute answers, his aim is to provoke public discourse, and this is entirely in keeping with his views on the integrated nature of public life. The drawback is that the reader may well be left wanting more guidance.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|What a rare treasure this book was. I felt like I was along with Harold on his journey - Beautiful writing and real characters. Wonderful!!
B0094KF4WG|4.0|This is a book about working for the United States special forces, particularly in relation to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. It is couched in operational language that blunts the impact of the earlier sections, but the task to find Bin Laden himself makes for compulsive and fascinating reading. Perhaps unintentionally the book conveys something of the necessary brutalisation process required to be successful in the field.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|FIFTY SHADES of GREY. FIFTY SHADES TRILOGY on My KINDLE FIRE: It was the most exciting book I've read in a long time . It kept drawling me back every time i put it down. Every page as exciting and heart wrenching as the one before. It had me smiling and crying with every moment while tugging at my heart strings for both the main characters, Ana and Christian. What a beautiful stimulating sexy exciting  love story of two people. I will definitely re read this again and again. I wish there were more then just three books to the story. I'm anxious to read some other works of E.L. James
B007T99ENE|5.0|This is a book about the relationship between empiricism, diplomacy and love. It has the best ending of any fiction that I have ever read. The ending reaches back across the novel in more than one register, revising assumptions in a very satisfactory way. It also reaches forward to open a number of differing interpretations of the work. The book also contains an amalgam of McEwan's greatest hits - the set piece, empirical description, slight of hand, suggestion and the comic turn.
B003B02PFO|4.0|Certainly not a typical Grisham but shows how a great writer can tackle any subject and entertain the reader. I've enjoyed all of Grisham's novels.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is another awesome read by the uber talented Mr. King.  The elements of time travel merged with details of history make for a riveting journey. My one complaint would be its length--only insofar as I could not put it down, and really should have been doing other things at times while I was reading!  11/22/63 was a day in history that few Americans alive at the time will ever forget.  The intriguing plot engages, enthralls, and entertains.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Really good book. I loved how it was written from the perspective of \\"death\\". It's not the way I was anticipating the story to flow when I bought the book, but it worked well. Beautifully written!
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|It's a good record/album.  A classic.  In my case much better quality than digitizing my vinyl version (and a hell of a lot easier to listen to while commuting on the train ;) ).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIE! MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS AFTER A WHILE I WAS GETTING TIRED OF ALL THE SEX. I GET THE POINT THEY ARE A FREAKY KINKY COUPLE THAT COOL BUT AFTER A WHILE I GOT TIRED.
0984999302|5.0|You may be successful, you may have tried and failed, either way you will definitely learn a repeatable process for success by reading and using this handbook. If you're even considering a startup idea or creating new product inside of an existing company you will benefit from reading this book. Buy two, one for you and one for your co-founder. The lean process works best in pairs.
B001NB545Q|5.0|This is the best example of their work.<br />Original<br />Tight<br />Focused<br />Rock'n<br /><br />The first 10 cuts are essential for any emerging fan, each cut is unique, perfectly played and most importantly original. Not a derivative theme in the set.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really good, a 2 niter. Don't see the code or secrets violations. If, u liked lone survivor u will like this, if u did not like lone survivor, I don't know what to tell ya.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I appreciate the security side of details on this topic.<br />But with that aside there was nothing in the book worth reading, or that I haven't read many times before.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I know this film did not get very good reviews but we really enjoyed it.<br />If you can deal with non stop action then this film is for you.<br />The graphics are very good.<br />Enjoy !!
0307341550|4.0|I imagine that, like me, a lot of people are going back to read Gillian Flynn's first novel, SHARP OBJECTS, after reading her national bestseller, GONE GIRL. SHARP OBJECTS is a page-turning mystery that presents a flawed heroine and a town full of tragic characters.<br /><br />Camille Preaker is an average reporter for Chicago's fourth largest newspaper. Her editor sends her home to Wind Gap, Missouri, to write about the murder of two young girls that have rocked the town. Camille is reluctant. She doesn't get along with her mom, and finds it painful to return home since her sister died when they were both young girls.<br /><br />While the mystery of who actually killed the two girls is always hovering around, the true pull of the novel is the portrait of the small town through the eyes of Camille. Camille is a damaged soul, so through her, every character has a flaw, every motive is questioned, no one is just kind for the sake of being kind. Camille doesn't do herself any favors. She abuses her body through hard drinking and other methods. She mentally abuses herself while pushing away those that care about her while at the same time longing for acceptance from her mom. The harshest portrait of a character is Amma, Camille's thirteen year old stepsister. Amma can be sweet, charming and evil, and she and her group of friends give a horrifying example of what junior high can be like.<br /><br />Flynn writes compelling novels and is deserving of her accolades. If you like dark, compelling mystery then I recommend all Flynn novels.

B0061PEAUY|3.0|Kathy Reichs is one of my favorite authors and I always grab her books as soon as they come available.  The beginning of this one, however, was so slow I almost put it down.  The ending was good enough to get three stars, but this was my least favorite of her books.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|We have somewhat of a \\"book club\\" (ages 23-56) going in our office lately and we've all recently finished this novel after an all too steamy encounter with another certain trilogy.<br />Hands down, we all agree this is GREAT! I read it in two days (and for me this is a serious accomplishment)! I just couldn't wait to find out what would happen next!<br />We can't wait to get Walking Disaster, I've already pre-ordered for my kindle!<br /><br />For starters: I've never been pulled into a novel so quickly! Handing me a fight club scene, blood covered cardigans, and tattoo covered B.A.M.F. all together and right off the bat sucked me in faster than any other author has done before. I love that Abby is a written with a backbone. The relationship between \\"Pigeon\\" and Travis is a little over the top at times, but in college what isn't!? Romance and tension are there without making it a porn (very respectable of the author--and very much appreciated), and we all found ourselves holding our breathe in Chapter 21! Kudos to this Jamie McGuire!<br /><br />We highly recommend it!!
B003WEA4UM|5.0|David Mitchells book is a literary Palindrome, the first half a mirror image of the second half. That, in and of itself is not intersting, but it is the means of weaving six stories spread across about 400 years of past, present and future that make the book so enthralling. Strong visual language and riveting action sequences are dovetailed with ruminations on mortality, reincarnation, deja-vu, morality,creation and redemption. There is no bigger palatte. Although some of the juxtapositions between stories are a bit sudden and contrived, the overall effect is shimmering, thought provoking and haunting. Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a book series that I couldn't hardly put down. This trilogy has been awesome! The worst part was that it had to end! :(
B00123IATW|5.0|The must have quintessential, Yes allegory.  Remastered just to enjoy the thundering organ patches after the calm has made you peaceful.  This is one of those must haves, out in your player, put it in the cloud have music so its accessible from anywhere.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game!  I play it on my PC and am glad I could get it on my Kindle Fire, so I can take it with me in my purse.  But be careful...it can become addictive :-)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A realistic account of life as SEAL, not glamorized or Hollywood-ized. Reading about the end of UBL was riveting, even though we know the outcome in advance.
B00992CF6W|5.0|please update the game with nether portals,  redstone and bigger playing field please please please please please please please please please please please please
B000002HRE|1.0|Boy these boy's should just give up. All the die-hard fans, of which I used to be will try and adore anything they put out. I gave up after the black album. Never bought Load or Re-load. Now that I think of it what aptly named releases? Maybe St Anger is the feeling that most die-hard fans have.<br /><br />  I never even listened to this but just listened to what others were saying about it. Rubbish.<br /><br />  The main reason I wrote this review is because these guy's are like Christianity. At first there was a lot to believe in. Now the people are standing up and saying wait a minute there is nothing to believe in. False idols. Just think how these guys would have been etched in the history of Rock had they stopped after the Black Album. Now they will be remembered for the war against Napster and how every release their after never gave anyone a reason to spend another dime on them.<br /><br />  I saw the opportunity that their were 665 reviews, mine rightfully so is 666.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Didn't really consider myself a prude but find it disheartening to learn that one of the most read books in the world concerns sexual bondage.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was such a fast read for me. So many twists and turns in this book! Just when you think you have finally started to figure out the mystery the author throws something else in that makes you change your whole perspective.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I felt this was believable and informative book on the life of a seal. It seems natural that as the war goes on the politics of war starts to interfear with the operations of the warrier.  I appreciate the seals work defending our country. As citizens we must remember that war is not like police work.  Its to dangerous, uncontrolable and difficult to be well contrained by clear rules that have good intentions. If we want a clean fight don't go to war in the first place. Its on the polititions not the warriers.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I haven't stopped listening to it since it came out! I have listened to their older stuff which is good too, but this is even better! Buying it was a great decision; I'll never regret it!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is fun! I am really enjoying this game...and it was free! I hope there is another one when I complete this one!
B009329ZF2|3.0|Generally well done.  Wish Liam Neeson had been given a bigger part.  The special effects are spectacular, but the script is lacking and character development is shallow at best. The use of the US Battleship Missouri in the story-line was inspired but not particularly well executed.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This book was fantastic.<br /><br />five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|Love Castle ... The acting is great ... and usually the writing.  Hope that now that C and B are finally \\"together\\" the writers bring back that  wonderful \\"Tracy and Hepburn\\" rapport that makes them really sizzle.  Things got a bit too intense and overly dramatic.  Need less of that and more clever dialogue and spice!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Several members of my book club had read this book over the summer and came back in September with rave reviews - a \\"gotta read.\\"  But, truthfully, I was wondering what all the fuss was about until I hit page 51 and then all hell broke loose.  It's a real page turner, full of twists and turns, going at breakneck speed or maybe that was just me - I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  Several times I thought I had figured it out but then the author throws in another twist. It's an interesting study of some very sick and diabolical personalties and it's up to the reader to figure out which ones they are.  Without spoiling, it does contain some raw language and sexual content and I did hate the ending.  However, true to the rest of the book, it's another twist. You have to respect the writer who is bold enough to do the unexpected.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The rule in our house is you must read the book before you can see the movie. After reading the book and having much discussion about over the next several weeks (and waiting the movie to come out on a DVD), we sat down to watch. I was a little concerned about the reported violence, which of course is in the book (Ms. Collins does a very good job of handling this important element in the book) but you never know how Hollywood will treat the same subject. However I was relieved from the start of the film as the director's handling was well within the meaning and feeling of the book, as well as the treatment and handling of the central themes of the book from the very start. In fact some themes were appropriately exaggerated so if you didn't read the book you should be able to easily pick-up on them so more kudos to the director for a fine job. Of course no movie can pack in all that is in the book, but \\"The Hunger Games\\" really delivered!  Three thumbs up, way up from our family!!<br /><br />As for the Amazon on-demand video - It ROCKS!!!! Super smooth streaming, clarity. and no hiccups (absolutely cannot say this about Netflix).
B0087DFIYA|3.0|This is Mel Gibson being Mel Gibson. It's up to you to decide whether to believe this is an unofficial prequel to PAYBACK. It certainly has the same feel, bad guys are bad, some badder than others. In this case, he winds up in a Mexican prison that is more a city with the warden being the mayor and alot of enforcers doing whatever they want to whomever they want whenever they want. No one is safe in there but to be fair, there are no real innocents either, even the children are hardcases through no fault of their own. Betrayed once again by his supposed friends, Mel does what Mel does best..gets to know what is going on and uses it to his advantange. And as in PAYBACK he gets even. Not the greatest Mel Gibson movie but certainly not one of the worst.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|In line with hunger games and insurgent...young girl busts out of dystopic society, falls in love, etc etc. Still an entertaining read. Hoping to get my 14 year old into it as well.
B0090EIILU|4.0|I found Cohen's character interesting.  Of course, his rant about invading other countries was a great spoof on USA.  He still has comedic talent, but unfortunately, his future efforts are going to be compared with Borat.  Borat was a magnificient presentation.  It will take some time before Sasha Baron Cohen leaves Borat's shadow.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|This is a must-see classic film with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the end. The acting by the entire cast is outstanding, and Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne and the departed Pete Postlethwaite do an especially fine job.
B004NOH9LW|3.0|This is a tough effort to find 20 words to review this movie.  First, I have nearly forgotten everything about it, and I watched it less than four weeks ago.  I don't know whether it was Damon's character or the plot, but I found myself wanting the movie to end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The ending of the series was gritty and mesmerizing. Great way to end the series - I couldn't put it down!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This video series is excellent in all ways. The storyline is compelling and the cinematography is superb.  Costuming and actor selection excels.
076780421X|4.0|One of the funniest love stories ever produced in movies format.  I don't normally like love stories, but this one is the exception.  Matthew Perry and Selma Hayek pull this one off with the help of all the other actors.  Even though the ending is predictable it was still fun to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mocking jay the last of the three book series turns out to be the best. It keeps your interest peeked from start to finish. The ending is far more than you could ask for. I recommend the series to anyone who likes adventure.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love it! Well devised characters, great plot!  I was glued to the tv for every episode. Excited for Season 2!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus is a triumph of cinema! This film successfully marries the challenging and the bold (both visually and narratively) with the proven format of classic sci-fi adventure/thriller. There is really no need for me to dig into the details (clearly this film is beyond divisive; everyone seems to have an opinion)...do yourself a favor and purchase this film on Blu Ray!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm totally addicted to pintrest now that ive downloaded this app. I'm on it all the time! awesome craft ideas for my cousins when I babysit. 5 stars all the way.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Great sound!I love her voice, sultry sound with a little irreverence in the lyrics.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0087HT36U|5.0|fun challenging visually exciting game that makes you think and analyze until you succeed with each level.  a game for all ages<br />.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app should have been a standard function of the kindle fire - it is so simple and helpful! It has helped me anticipate when to charge and how long that will take. Highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|best game ever. its awesome I love it. but the coins don't come fast Haha. I suggest downloading it,  if you want a coin game
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|When I first started to watch this movie I was thinking it was for only young people which I'm not!  But this movie turned out to be great . . . it kept my interest throughout the whole movie.
B00136JS12|5.0|Love love love Boston! Classic rock doesn't get any better than this. Takes me back to my carefree days! You won't regret purchasing this album.
B007L24T52|3.0|The plot revolves around Will Robie a government hitman who finds himself involved in a far reaching conspiracy.  He ends of protecting a 14 year old runaway who is also a target for the very sophisticated villains that are stalking them.  It wasn't bad and the best part of this book was definitely the end.  I felt however that it dragged in the middle and the plot became a bit too complicated to follow at certain points.  I did figure out something about the ending which brought me a certain amount of satisfaction.  Nevertheless despite the enthusiastic reviews I don't consider this one of Baldacci's best books.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app works great on my phone. Better than any other downloader out there. Just beware of downloading this app from online unverified sites, most have a virus in them. This one is clear of any virus(that my antivirus can find). Upload and enjoy.
B0065CCM76|5.0|This album just keeps on keepin' on!  You forget how many great hits Bob Seger has had and they are all on this CD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the story... the sex gets a little tedious.    It is doubtful that anyone does it that many times in a day_
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book, full of adventure great characters and suspense. The setting is well rounded so you truly get a feel for where all the action is taking place.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book.  Could not put it down.  What a great adventure and journey of self realization and strength! Glad I don't have to make that trek.
B0090EKRKU|2.0|The movie was not very good. For an animated feature, there are usually a few laughs for the adults and a more for the kids, but I'm not sure this had too many all the way around. Fairly boring. I'd say pass on this one.<br /><br />The picture quality was very good.
B008GANNIC|5.0|POD did a great job of combining their classic sound with new innovation. These guys are really talented and they show that again on this album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever read! I wish it wouldn't end and that E L James would write more books to follow the third :)
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was released may 24th 2012 and 50 shades of grey was may 25 2011 and it was so close to a copy with a crappy ending that I cant believe they printed it and she got away with copying 50 shades of grey. If you want a good book stay away from this one and read 50 shades of grey.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The characters say the say thing over and over again, sometimes with the  exact the same verbiage.  Even the sex scenes are too simular to stimulate the reader more than once.  If you want some good S&M check the internet.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thought the book was an easy read, well done.  It didn't seem to me like the author told any secrets, which he said he wouldn't.  Thankfully someone has written an accurate account of what went on,
B004SBQGHS|4.0|It's classic.<br />It works smoothly!<br />Of course....it's good to play together.<br />My children like so much.<br />Anyway, it's free and free.
030758836X|4.0|Wow. This was just, wow. It's been a long long long time since I read anything this gripping and brilliant. Gillian Flynn is a bloody fantastic writer, she has the wonderful ability of making her characters human, but also more importantly relatable. I could see certain traits of Nick and Amy in myself and friends, and as an aspiring writer, I envy her gift for creating them so perfectly and, what seems like with such ease too.<br /><br />On the morning of their 5th anniversary, Amy has vanished. The story follows Nick and his quest to locate Amy, trying to avoid suspicion that seems to be building as Amy remains missing for longer and longer.<br /><br />It's a really gripping story. And I won't give any spoilers away, but the reason it got 4 stars was down the ending. The ending made sense, it's just as a reader, I didn't necessarily agree with it or for that matter like it.<br /><br />Nevertheless it's a cracking read and deserves all the praise and publicity it's getting. Faboosh.
B008K8U13K|4.0|The original Sonic series has always been considered to be Sega's best. During the 2000s, the series had nothing but a big line of clunkers and game collections, with a few exceptions (Sonic Unleashed, Colors, Adventure series, and the handheld games, to name a few). Then, instead of re-releasing the old Sonics again, Sega finally decided to make Sonic 4, a game that was meant to take the series back to its roots? Did it succeed? I'd say so.<br /><br />Sonic 4 may happen to rehash of Sonic 1 & 2 elements, but the level design, music, homing attack and graphics are all-new (At least, to the original series). The basic gameplay holds up pretty well, and there are some really cool gimmicks added into this installment, such as running across a path of cards, riding in a mine cart, having to beat the special stages under time limits (and no jumping during the Special Stages), etc.<br /><br />Of course, there have to be some flaws. First off, since this was built from ground-up, the physics are off and somewhat floaty. Another thing is that it was really easy compared to the previous Sonics. You won't have a hard time being able to collect 100 (or even 200) rings. Another thing is that this handheld version of the game contains 2 exclusive levels. One of which has Sonic ride in a minecart entirely and the other a \\"pinball challenge\\". Those levels aren't really as fun as the levels that replaced them in the console version. I also recall the Special Stage controls not being totally responsive. Lastly, although this is minor, it could have been more fitting for Sega to use the classic design of Sonic for the game.<br /><br />Those flaws aren't to say that the game is bad. The game itself is just as fun as its predecessors. In fact, while it does contain 4 zones compared to the other Sonics' 6+, certain levels themselves are pretty long. I timed it, and the game is actually just as lengthy as the old Sonics, if not longer. It could be a bit steep for a purchase, but it is totally worth it.<br /><br />Overall, people can say it's a rehash, but in my perspective shown above, in which I think about what's beyond that, it's a new fun Sonic game. Does it have a lot of flaws? Yeah, but they are pretty tolerable.tally worth it.<br /><br />Overall, people can say it's a rehash, but in my perspective shown above, in which I think about what's beyond that, it's a new fun Sonic game. Does it have a lot of flaws? Yeah, but they are pretty tolerable.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am not sure what all the hype is about this book. While I am not a prude, I just think the language was overboard. I could not like either Amy or Nick. Hated the ending.
0525953728|3.0|It was poorly written and you have to question how accurate it is, but it was a fast and fun read that was perfect for the beach.<br /><br />Not much more I can say about it.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Love it. Smooth as silk. Classic, turn based, hex board, strategy game. Feels like a professional quality game. They even give movement penalties for terrain, such as swamps. Very well done.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Being a non military person I some times got lost in the \\"alphabet soup\\" jargon, but over all the book was very interesting, gave a whole new perspective as to what really happened. I have a heightened respect for the Seals, they job they do and the extensive training they under go.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Seichan is one of my favorite characters of all the books I've read. To have her as the central figure was great. Would not want her after me.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the gentle reminders the app sends me to keep me on track. great to use my kindle at church..no more fumbling to find the right passage. great ap
B006LSZECO|2.0|I didn't like this book and found it totally unsatisfying. The reason it got 2 stars is that I did want to finish it rather than quit in the middle. But the characters are unrealistic, hyper-stereotypical, and at times just plain crude. I did not like the style of writing either.
0385342063|5.0|This book is hilarious! The situations that arise are comical, could be relatable, and keeps you guessing. I borrowed this book from the library, but I loved it so much that I bought it on here to send to my sister! I had never read any of Sophie Kinsella's novels before, but this book showcased her fantastic writing ability. I have already read \\"Twenties Girl\\" and \\"Remember Me?\\", they are fantastic! A must read for anyone looking to indulge in some girly humor, it's definitely a feel good book!
B002SW8Y2E|5.0|Really exciting, full of new ideas, well written book!<br />Although the \\"big surprise\\" was quite obvious before it has been revealed. :)<br />But it's a must read.
0811870413|5.0|It's the best bread-making book I have and I'm still enjoying it a lot!  It offers a different perspective of making - and enjoying making - bread while immerse you in the magical journey that Chad and Elisabeth took to rediscover some of the ancient knowledge about bread making, which finally allowed him to develop his own way to master bread making. It also make me feel I have to go to their bakery, in one of those cold mornings in San Francisco, to enjoy that pleasure in person.
B000ME5B30|5.0|I watched \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" for an Oceanography class. I am familiar with the topic of climate change but this movie puts it in easy to understand language with excellent diagrams. I recommend it to all students and adults who don't believe in climate change. The scary part is that we have so little time to get the CO2 under control before it is too late.
B007SGM084|5.0|I just finished the first book in no time and I am already in the 2nd book :) Love the fact that it comes in soft version.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It starts out like every other crime novel, and you think you know excactly how it ends. But the story twists and turns in unexpected ways until the end. This is the most original crimestory I have read in years. The language is exellent and keeps you bound to the pages. If you are only reading one novel this year, chose this one
B00122LXTM|5.0|Every song the Dobbie Brother's ever did that you would want or need in you collection. Perfect fit! Well done!!
B008ULRY78|5.0|We loved this movie. All action, no real story line, but that is not what we were looking for. A movie you can watch again and again. Can't wait for the next one!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\".  Each novel of the \\"Tatoo\\" series is full of suspense, intrigue, romance - it's hard to put any of the books down.  I read all three within a couple of weeks.  It's a tragedy Stieg Larsson died before his time, he was an extremely gifted author.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thought this account was just that of a participant.  Very interesting about SEALs.  They are in a warrior class which is truly at the tip of the spear.  As far as a source for intelligence I think a Time magazine account would provide about the same level of insight, maybe more.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Song is upbeat...gets your heart pumping and promotes good feelings and happiness. Beat is fantastic...and lyrics are upbeat. You just want to sing and dance...when you hear this song
B009329ZF2|4.0|The picture kept me watching right through alot of cool special effects and action. I am glad they did not overact it or it would have been horrible ,it just kept moving along.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|I've been hoping for a Samus figure ever since the ending of Metroid: Fusion. After unlocking one of the images in the gallery that showcased an illustration of a SA-X and Fusion suit Samus figure pack, I kept thinking, \\"Why haven't they done that for real yet?!\\" This figure is excellently detailed, using the design tweaks implemented in Samus' armor design for Metroid: Other M. It's gorgeous, and has quite a bit of articulation. The head has limited movement, but that's understandable considering the armor design. My beef was with the legs. The knee joints are strange: double jointed, like the D-arts Mega Man X figures, but the knee joint also has a swivel. Oddly enough, it allows for a considerable amount of posability that the limited waist joints otherwise inhibit.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A good read much different from first hand knowledge than previous books written about this raid.  Recommended to anyone who enjoys modern nonfiction reading.
B009329ZF2|4.0|...this movie snob found herself generally engaged with the movie and even shed a tear or two near the end. I love a good action flick but that's just it - good action is sometimes hard to find. This wasn't bad at all and certainly better than most of the goofy crud offered lately.<br /><br />Go ahead and spend the few bucks on it - add some popcorn and kick your feet up for a nice few hours of distraction.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book got my attention in the first chapter. By the middle of the novel, I couldn't put it down. It had twists and turns that were totally unexpected but quite realalistic.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|The Lorax is a fun family movie with a sobering message about our responsibility to steward well our planet. It has an all-star cast of voice talent and actors and rich music throughout. But for some reason it didn't have the magic of a story that draws you in and takes you on a ride. My kids enjoyed it (ages 9 and 7) but I don't think we would watch it again.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Really good, loved it!! Couldn't put it down, then toward the end I slowed down because I didn't want it to end.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This book was a difficult one for me to read as a Grandmother of young men this age of Christopher, young men who share his idealism about the world.  I must say the book was very well researched by a man who might have suffered the same fate in his early years.  I was compelled to read this just to see if the author could conclude what led to Christopher's strange and tragic end.  Mr. Krakauer, I think, probably came close to the real reason that such a promising young man's life ended way too soon.  Read it!  It's  unforgettable!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|good app. just ad more music. i slept great with this. it helped my mind stop the thought prosess so i could sleep!!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I love this show. I was hesitant about paying for it, but I'm mad that I didn't do it sooner. I love this show and can not wait for the upcoming season.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I really liked it. I thought it was a good movie. The download went fast.  I would rent another movie.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|So many people think this movie is funny.  My wife and I watched this movie and were pretty much bored the entire time.  We kept waiting for the funny parts.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am addicted to this game!  A friend told me to try it.  It is not the type of game I usually play, but now it is the best-challenging-frustrating and fun.  I love it!
B0086700CM|3.0|This is a fun game to pass the time but I do get bored with it easily. It seems to be just the same thing over and over.
B000PVAFT0|5.0|I love this movie. It's very informative, good for kids and the narration is fantastic and not boring. Would definitely recommend
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I have been using Tripadvisor for 8 years. I use it to plan all of my trips. I love reading all of the reviews. It prepares you for what to expect out of a hotel, restaurant, or attraction. I trust TA for all of my vacations.

B005K01VZS|5.0|this book is unbelievable...it makes you take a real look at how you live your life and what you do with your time. it is inspiring,thought provoking,and just a really good book to make you take a deep look into yourself,and how you live your life.
B008EEHRAU|5.0|The scenery went perfect with the movie, you would have to be a bit of a romanticist to enjoy, but, I guess that I must be. It really held my interest all the way through. Aside from the storyline, it does make a social statement regarding abusive relationships, and not staying in them, but finding a way out. Although the abused is a woman, it holds true for men as well.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is an amazing app. My fiance and I listen to this almost every single night. I would recommend this to anyone. I usually try only the free apps and when I tried this one.. I decided to buy the premium version.. We use the Grandfather clock, underwater and ocean to sleep.
B008602KQI|5.0|The scenery, photography, costumes and storyline are all stellar. I wouldn't recommed to small children as there is violence against children by children, but, it is very entertaining.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was recommended by my daughter. While reading the book, I could almost relate to the characters as their personalities reminded me of people I have known, just not on such a grand scale. It is almost like a study in human behavior. How far some will go to get what they want, how easy it is to lie and cheat to be special if only to ourself. The ending was not what I wanted, but I don't think it could have ended any other way.Purchased the book on Amazon for my Kindel, and hard a hard time putting it down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG!  I could not read them fast enough.  Finished book 1 Friday night at 11:00 and downloaded book 2 5:00 A.M.  by Sunday night I downloaded book 3.  This was an amazing story and I felt so connected to Christian and Ana. They reminded me that although most do not have such a horrible childhood, we all have baggage and need to be more understanding to our loved ones.  We ALL have issues, but they  would sure fade for me with that kind of money.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The book includes detailed history of the presidency from when President Harry Truman took over the presidency at the death of Franklin Roosevelt.  It has information and facts about the presidency of the United States that you will not find in a typical history class.  It brings back memories for me of people in government with much more information on events that I experienced.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is an excellent movie for learning what dedicated men we have protecting us. I'm glad they are on our side!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved it so much I'm reading it a 2nd time, have recommended it to several friends & am picking it for book club!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not care for the book. It had the same thing going on and on and on. It did not leave me wanting to continue buying the rest of the series. The story was not very exciting, and very slow moving!
B0090EIILU|1.0|A very silly and crude movie. If you are hard up for 'entertainment' or like off the chart stuff, then try it.  I saw no point to any of it but gave it one star out of sheer kindness.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Well thought out. Love the action. Absolutely over the top! Does this man ever age? :). I love all his movies.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It does not give any hints to assist you if you get stuck. It seems to have several unneccasary steps that does not progress the game.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I loved this little fable. It made me think of how precious time really is, a gift, not to be wasted. Mitch Albom did it again.
B008RJFRTK|3.0|I love the fact that I can view maps offline. My HTC Flyer has only wifi and I am never near wifi when I need directions. My only complaint is that the search feature is not working on my tablet and I can't seem to reach anyone for support.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book did not hold any surprises about SEAL training but very interesting details about the raid to kill UBL.
B000N90JG8|5.0|I thought the acting was very good. Both actress and actors played a very good role. I will rent it again it was that good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was hard to put down.  I really liked that it was not easy to predict how it was going to turn out.  I am an avid reader, and this was one of the best I have read!
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Interesting and unique story, and Clint Eastwood is wonderful.  That is not surprise, he is one of the most intelligent and original actors out there.  He is not afraid to think for himself and this has always been the case.  The movie was entertaining and has a great message.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The content of her experience resonated as truth. This perception can be another way to look at the path home. To be unafraid. As in the prodigal son parable, she was welcomed home with open arms and unconditional love.  Anita wrote a beautiful picture of the unexplainable. Thank you Anita, for being willing to return and be helpful to all willing to see.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I love new girl and buying an entire season was the best decision I've ever made! It's the funniest and the cutest tv show :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just to know this SOB is gone, makes my day ! Hopefully it will bring some closure to thousand of others.<br />Enjoy reading books of incidents of people in there own words who were involved, and not proof read by<br />media.
B002413TY2|4.0|Hey what can I say I like chop sockie,this movie is all right.  For people that like action movies and guns and Martialarts this is the movie.  Not much plot to fhe movie about same as the other too he maid .  But it is a thrill ride through the movie,so if you rent or buy the movie in my opinion it was worth it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I always enjoy reading Mitch's books. Have been a fan of his writings since his 1st book. Just down to earth writing style, in laymans terms :-)
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Firstly, the standard disclaimer. I received this book in a GoodReads drawing so it made its way to my door at no cost as part of the book's marketing. Even so, as always I will endeavor to give the book an honest airing.<br /><br />I rated the Orphan Master at 5 stars but to be honest it's a rather weak five stars. The topic, the novel and varied life of a North Korean orphan and conscripted soldier, is automatically amusing before the second page is even turned. We get to see what life is at least theorized to be like in that backwards little Asian country. The depiction is keenly Orwellian and inspires great pity for a people so ruthlessly used by a tyrant for generations.<br /><br />All that said though it does begin, after a while to inspire a bit of ennui. There's only so much to say and Johnson seems to say it again and again and again. At half way I was a ship happily adrift in the sea of this novel. By the last few pages I was just tired and looking for the shore. The ending, though dramatic and appropriate, failed to spur me to awe because of the length of time it took to get to it and the fact that it was fairly obvious after all the lead-up.<br /><br />Well worth a read, perhaps spread out over a lazy week or so. Transitions between narrators can be abrupt in the last half of the book though so take special care to figure out exactly who it is suddenly using the first person before you go to far. Enjoy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to pin and do it on the go with my kindle fire. best app since I don't have to access it via web.. great app shortcut
B001490ZME|5.0|my title  tells it all: how great and unusual is this series. The acting is excellent  and the main character's metamorphosis is wonderfully done!
1451629192|5.0|\\"A Stolen Life\\" chronicles Jaycee Dugard's 18 year nightmare at the hands of Phillip Garrido and his wife Nancy. She shares her experience as she was constantly sexually and emotionally abused by the couple, bearing 2 of his children during her captivity. Dugard shares her reflections on the experience and how her life is after her rescue.<br /><br />The book will make you angry at the couple, especially Nancy, who had more than 1 opportunity to set Jaycee free, but failed to do so. You will really be angry at a justice system that clearly failed (Garrido was a registered sex offender, yet no one thought to check on why he had children living on his property).<br /><br />Dugard is a survivor, and we take the journey with her. It is painful to read, and I admit that there was a great deal of tears shed when reading the book. I think about how painful it was for Dugard to bring her ordeal into the light for those to see, and I feel that she was brave to do so.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is 1 of the best games I've seen on the Amazon market. Its fun engaging the graphics are great and I can't put it down
B008OOYALE|2.0|Dragon Story is a typical \\"get you hooked and get you to pay money\\" game. It is really fun and addicting but they set it up to make you pay to advance in the game. Dragons and other things in the game cost \\"gold\\" and \\"gold\\" costs real money to buy. So you can only go so far without paying. You can easily rack up the money in a short amount of time because the \\"gold\\" doesn't go very far. Clever on team lava to create an addictive game that makes people give crazy money to them.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book is very well written, and truly speaks to core American values. Honor, Duty, Country, Friendship, Courage and Perserverance. It should be required reading for all high schoolers. A true valuable addition to American Literature and the American Spirit.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the second one we have purchased. We wore the first one out. It is a family tradition to watch this Christmas Eve both in  Phoenix and in Asheville. It just never gets old. We wait for certain scenes and know the script by heart.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Very good book. The main character is inspiring and authentic. Like The Art of Fielding, the premise is that a book can influence a young person and make a difference. I loved learning about the meanings of flowers but this was just a small part of the story. The major point is to observe the growth of a young girl to adulthood. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great quality streaming video. No buffering not pauses. Great movie also. Always thought it would be a \\"chick flick\\" but really liked it. I recommend it to everyone
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|\\"A Discovery of Witches\\" is fantastic.  I hated putting it down, but when I had to, I couldn't get it out of my head.  I will say, that it started a little slow, but picked up momentum around chapter four or so.  A must read!
B007AB5KF2|5.0|I'm a 42 year old man, I have not watched a running series since the original 90210 with my wife. Then this thing comes along and I watch this with my wife, like I said in the title addicting!
B003TH2LYY|5.0|Fantastic show.  Love the chemistry between the whole cast.  And the story lines are interesting and engaging.  Can't wait to see how Castle & Beckett's romance turns out.
B004AP9W46|4.0|I cannot say that this is my favorite of the series, but the perspective and description that Ms. Rice gives Heaven, Hell, God, the Devil, and her take on the spiritual journey are truly thought provoking.  I finished this book a couple of days ago and keep replaying some of the imagery in my mind.  I mean, wow.  Just wow.  I am not the best with words, but her writing truly took you there and for myself, described exactly how I pictured them.  No matter what your personal beliefs are in the afterlife, I think it is a great read.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Maybe I'm a romantic, but I like books that are thought provoking, and have a satisfying end...this had neither. The language was superfluous, the characters unbelievable, and the plot highly unbelievable. I read many reviews before purchasing, all good, so was highly disappointed that this is what young people find entertaining. There are psychological thrillers out there that are devoid of the foul language and poorly constructed scenarios of this book. And they are great books. I was highly offended by the content of this book.<br />I also recently purchased a book that was clearly intended, after reading the first chapters, for teens to early 20somethings.. I wish amazon would let us know the age books are intended for, if they contain graphic sex, violence, or other offensive material, etc before I buy another book...
B008LZHA3G|5.0|You really can't usually judge a Bob Dylan album from listening once, or twice, or even three times. You have to listen to his albums a few dozen times to really form a strong opinion.  That being said, this album has a nice rhythm and the music draws you in.  It is great to get another album from Mr. Dylan.  So far, I've listened to it a few times and really like several of the songs. So I'd recommend it as another enjoyable Dylan.
B0083EW97W|4.0|John Mayer has certainly done a little bit of redeeming himself on this album.  After Battle Studies, Mayer fans may have thought that all hope was lost.  But it seems all hope was not lost.  This album certainly does not live up to the blues/rock of Contiuum, but musically it holds its own.  The album has a folky, I'm-a-rambler feel which is soothing.  It is a very laid back album which is sure to have you listening over and over.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|It was just as good as I remembered!  The grand kids (2&4) sat mesmerized for the entire movie!  Ttkhanks for the nice afternoon!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I feal like I now have the real truth about what happened. His description of the events make more sence. I don't think any citizen should be distrubed by the way they killed Binladden. Their lives were on the line too and they performed perfectly!
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Loved this film.<br />Acting from EVERYONE was excellent.<br />Heart wrenching flick about just how precious our time with others is and how life has a way of working itself out, regardless of our own efforts to thwart that from happening.<br /><br />This is an intelligent movie and I highly recommend it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the best drama shows on TV. Each episode brings a new twist to the plot and each character is well played.  Come on season 2.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|For anyone who has been in Military or had a loved one who is/was, this movie will mean so much more than to those who don't.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use,very good size of buttons, make it easy to see as well.  Convenient to access on my I phone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the whole trilogy.  Really enjoyable for all ages.  So happy there is a third book in the series!  Definitely keeps you wanting more!
B009329Y30|2.0|I love other Nicolas Sparks movies like The Notebook, Dear John, but for some reason this one didn't do it for me. Wanted to see it in the theater even, but glad I waited for home rental.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all three of the books in this series.  Definitely worth investing some time in to read them.  I was so enthralled I read all three books in 4 days!  And I have three kids at home!  I ignored them a little for a few days, but they lived!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is usually so non-speedy that it doesn't raise my blood pressure but does give me a chance to think.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I hope to see this group succeed and continue to bring us their amazing creativity.  I enjoy their variety of sounds and arrangements.  Each member has a crucial role.  My favorite tracks are Starships and Aha, but all are good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great way to end the trilogy.  Loved every page of it. The true essence of every character was finally revealed. It almost made me sad to see the story end.
B004FN2CZY|5.0|I have always loved this story and read it every year.  I'm so haapy that I now have it in my Kindle and can take it with me an read it whenever I want!
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|If there is such a thing as a 'death-affirming' film, The Grey is just that, a film which faces death head on in grizzled, human fashion and invites the viewer to gaze unblinking as well. This isn't a sugar-coated survival story where men built giant implements from jungle grass and spears or end up staring up at a heavenly deus ex machina helicopter that happens to be surging over the Alaskan tundra. No, The Grey is a dour, sometimes even depressing, film, where survival is questionable, but the battle must still be fought.<br />Liam Neeson--in a far less super-human role than he plays in, say, Taken--leads a few ragged oil men through a remote part of Alaska following a plane crash. The men are starving, freezing, and very, very afraid. The characters are a bit familiar, there is the hot-head renegade, for example, who spars with Neeson over leadership roles and attempts to purloin dead mens' wallets. The archetypes like this man lend a striking humanity to the survivors--these are flawed people in an unfamiliar and hostile world. We are trapped with them whether we like it or not. But they are not alone in all that ice and whipping wind. Haunting predators are loose in the snow, showing up without warning like horror movie creatures. Blood flows and bodies are mauled. The men try to continue to live in spite of this. They must work together to face the seemingly impossible probability that they will perish. Neeson, at times, is a Shepard of sorts, offering a dying man comforting words early on as he bleeds out. The man looks around, wild-eyed, terrified, repeating, \\"Something's wrong. Something's wrong. I'm too warm. I don't know what's happening.\\" \\"You're dying,\\" Neeson calmly assures him, \\"and it is going to be over soon. Tell me who you love. And let that person guide you there.\\" Sound heavy? It sure as hell is. This is not a popcorn thrill-ride like the trailers made it out to be--though there are indeed breathtaking action sequences (the plane crash is one of the best on record, for example). This is a tough, sometimes hard-to-watch, though ultimately beautiful and poignant human endurance tale. There is a sanctity in death explored here that lesser films of this genre (The Edge, for example) were quite a bit too timid (or worried over box office potential) to explore. The Grey explores the power of death and the will to face it knowingly.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|Love Adam Levine's voice and it is really showcased on this album. Great to have playing in the background while I work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is an exciting read, twisting in unexpected ways. Gillian Flynn has a gift for narrative voice. Be careful- you can't put it down once you start reading!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|ANGRY BIRDS is the cutest, most addictive app today. Love it. Play it. Dream about it. Ad-free is the icing on the cake :D
B008IJTFYW|5.0|really helps you relax if ur stressed out of just need to relax awesome and some are realty realistic to the real sound
B007UXSPK2|1.0|Bad guy walks away from a head on collision??<br />The story is not credible.  The bad guy is either super human or there is a sub plot about secret human testing that I missed.  It was a major distraction.
B00846REIS|4.0|As good as 50 Shades. Loved that the characters were smarter and hip. Can't wait to read the sequel. If you liked 50 you'll love this one also.
0446615625|2.0|Four D.C. area wacky people, starring the brilliant, brave, misunderstood Oliver Stone, uncover an amazingly complex, cast hundreds of Muslims, who plan to kidnap the president on the occasion of his birthplace changing the town's name to his name. This is the first time I have been disappointed with a David Baldacci novel. Was he trying to write a farce?
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Charming, entertaining, delightful, inventive, fun, and laugh-out-loud book.  Full of wonderful characters, upbeat, and gives the heart a lift.  Happy and inspiring--I hope the whole world reads it and enjoys it even more than all the rest of us who love it!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|In a hurry, so I will just say: This was a life changing book. Hope to see more by the same author.
B00932A6G4|5.0|Excellent animation - good story line - good followup to the original movie series.  If you are a fan of the series - must see
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Don't really get a sense for Thatcher, except as a elderly woman struggling with Alzheimers. Whether or not one agrees with her politics (I don't), that's the real story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not exactly sure how I feel about this book. It did keep me glued to it for the two or three days it took me to read it, but it's such a downer... and yet I liked how it didn't go the clich&eacute; route and had Katniss doing typical heroic noble stuff. Hell, she messed up most of the time, and got plenty of people killed for nothing, but that was realistic, if you ask me. She might have been good enough to survive two Hunger Games, but she was no soldier, and too much was being asked of her, especially with all that pressure about being the Mockingjay and thus the target of the Capitol. Her constant psychological breakdowns were to be expected, though most people would have broken down completely way before she did.<br /><br />I feel like Suzanne Collins just wanted to write an exploration of the human condition (basically, our capacity for cruelty), but for some reason went with a Young Adult series to do this. It will be really interesting how all of this suffering, gory violence, and psychological torture is translated to the big screen; \\"The Hunger Games\\" might have seemed to be a bit controversial for a YA movie, but that was nothing compared to this. It's almost like the Harry Potter series jumping for the semi-lightheartedness of book two to the heavy grimness of book seven in just three books. You better grow up fast.<br /><br />Speaking of Harry Potter, if \\"Catching Fire\\" reminded me of \\"Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire\\", \\"Mockingjay\\" reminded me of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\". How? Well, like the Dark Knight trilogy, the beginning was good, the second part was brilliant, and the conclusion was sort of grim, nowhere as good as the second part, but a satisfying conclusion nonetheless, especially the last lines, where Katniss and Peeta use the Real or not Real game one last time.<br /><br />Yeah, from time to time I'm a sucker for corny endings too.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|Dwayne (Danny McBride) despises his father (Fred Ward) and wants his riches.  The natural choice is to link up with a bonehead friend named Travis (Nick Swardson) to make a bomb, kidnap a pizza delivery guy named Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), make Nick rob a bank, and use the money from the bank heist to hire a hitman (horribly out of place Michael Pena).  If it sounds like a little bit too much to squeeze together into a coherent plot that has a semblance of believability, I agree.  And that's not even considering the hitman's intricate side story, flamethrowers, an Indian best friend inexplicably named Chet (Aziz Ansari), and the dreaded, unnecessary romantic angle that seemingly gets shoe-horned into every movie for absolutely no redeemable reason (well, getting Dilshad Vadsaria some screen time is the only redeemable reason).<br /><br />There are several laughs, and fans of McBride will like the movie more than most.  He absolutely steals the movie from the intended \\"star\\" Eisenberg, who does his best to distance himself from Zombieland.  The distance is not enough, and Rule #1 needs to be revisited.  He is neither believable or worth rooting for - unlike Zombieland.  He plays Eisenberg.  It's interesting to note, however, that McBride plays a stereotypical McBride character and comes off brilliantly.<br /><br />It's nothing that will blow your socks off, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen.  The deleted scenes and outtakes are pretty good.  Rent it; don't buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|By far my favorite book of the series.<br /><br />The ending of \\"The Hunger Games\\" left it clear that surviving the Games wasn't the end of the road for Katniss, that now the Capitol's feathers were ruffled and they had a rebellion to quell before it started. \\"Catching Fire\\" devotes the first half to Katniss trying (very unsuccessfully, of course) to cool down the rebellious spirits of the districts after Snow threatened her and her family. Since the book is called \\"Catching Fire\\" and not \\"Cooling Down\\", you can pretty much know what happens next... except that, before that \\"next\\" thing happens - that's for the final installment, \\"Mockingjay\\" - there's a second Hunger Games Katniss has to attend to, for failing to cool down anything.<br /><br />Once it got to that part, this book reminded me a lot, in a good way, of \\"Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire\\". In that book, a tournament of champions was set up, one in which Harry had no business to be in, and one which by the end will trigger the war between the wizards and the Death Eaters. Here it's basically the same, with a Hunger Games that now feature past champions from every district, and one in which by the end will trigger the war between the districts and the Capitol. The set up of the Games themselves is more interesting than in the first book, and Katniss being forced into alliances with victors from other districts adds another interesting twist (since, of course, by the end there can be only one).<br /><br />This is probably the easiest book in the trilogy to adapt to a movie, and am looking forward to how they do it.
B0060D11LI|5.0|You watch these movies for the amazing choreography and to see favorite dancers.  The story line is a background for the choreo...the choreography was stunning.
B00138GZAC|5.0|Her amazing voice is showcased in this \\"best of\\" package. The soft, sultry, romantic vibe that Sade is best known for is overwhelming. One of the best albums in my collection.
B004LGE2LC|4.0|even though all the theories revolving throughout about the dragon infestation aren't well thought out and don't always make sense.  HOWEVER.  Just love this film, and its \\"storybook\\" feel...BEST BARE CHESTED MATTHEW MCCONOUGHY EVER!!!!  Heads up, Ladies....
B005K17RU0|5.0|More straight forward and intuitive than the weather channel app. Nice graphics and easy to use interface. Has a 15 day forecast feature.
B000KJZWMW|3.0|and I had forgotton how dated, sexist, and just plain old this one would now seem.  Still, if you're a fan of this series, as I am, you have to watch them in chronological order, or it just isn't the same.  An extremely young looking Mel Gibson.
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. Reading, running, in the car - its just that good.  Her voice is so serene.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Straight forwad, no nonsense or fluff.  May be overly technical for some, but offers those of interest a gritty insight that only someone who lived it can provide.<br /><br />Read the book in one evening, easy read for thsoe with a military background or with topical insight.  Those who are not in tune with the subject matter, or have some preconcieved ax to grind with the author's decision to write it, will probably not like it.  Open your eyes to an accurate historical accounting, ditch all of the personal prejudices.<br /><br />The author's decision to write the book, without the proper, pre-publication review, will unfortunately cloud a lot of opinions - too bad!
B0091XRL86|4.0|My girlfriend and I always enjoy a good animated movie and The Pirates did not disappoint. It had a good story and good clean humor.
B007JMW46U|5.0|This is obviously a great book, so there's nothing new I can tell you people or any reasons for you to love it too.<br />honestly Sir. A.C.D was one of the best...<br />This book is a must
B009329ZF2|4.0|Enjoyed the action and CGI.  Would have changed the ending a bit (the brother survives) but overall the movie was very good even if it were based on a board game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wish the series didn't end...great book, have to check out the movie now!<br />Please read the entire series, worth it!
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Amazing album. Two months and i'm still listening constantly. Highly recommend both the album and the documentary. Be sure to check out Cold Fact as well.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Since implementing  the suggestions in this book, I have \\"accidently\\" lost 10 pounds and have a lot more energy! I recommend it.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Story got too cheesie at the middle of the movie. Aliens had better weapons than earth people. Aliens should had won!!!!!!
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Not as intense as season three, but still great! Tara finally grows a back-bone and puts Gemma in her place. Lots of drama between Clay and Piney.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|It is Testament!!!  What else needs to be said?  After listening to it about a dozen times I would have to say \\"Chuck...You are still a great singer!!!\\"  Erik writes great riffs.  The band is tight and I love them.  I saw them a few months ago in Cincinnati with Death Angel and Anthrax and they still rock out as hard as ever.  Dark Roots brings back a little of their past from say Souls of Black but is a continuation of their harder stuff too.  Testament is one of bands that never lets me down.  Keep thrashing.<br /><br />Russ

B008UTV6S8|4.0|Paul Simon is the consummate artist/musician; a guy that still cranks out fantastic new music after 50+ years in the business. For me, it was a no-brainer to pick up this new CD/DVD combo package. I've been a Paul Simon fan since I was a kid, and I've been to more than a few of his concerts, including the opening show for this tour (Seattle, April 15, 2011). The music from the Webster Hall concert does not disappoint. The band is tight, Simon is in excellent voice, and the song set is outstanding! My only regret is that some major tunes performed that night were cut for this release: Vietnam (a song by Jimmy Cliff), Mystery Train, Wheels, Peace Like a River, Questions for the Angels, Road to Nowhere (with David Byrne) and You Can Call Me Al(with David Byrne). The saddest deletion for me is Mystery Train. I heard Simon say on \\"Center Stage\\" (talk show in NY) that Mystery Train is his favorite Rock N' Roll song, and in another interview, he said that 60% of his music is based on Mystery Train. Amazing! No wonder there are so many Elvis references in his movie \\"One Trick Pony\\". Anyway, it would have been great for Paul to make all the songs from this wonderful Webster Hall concert available on this release. Nevertheless, what is released is exceptional and well worth buying.
B0091XRL86|4.0|There is a lot of great humor in this movie.  Some of it may be a bit over the heads of younger viewers (under 10).  There are a couple of somewhat more adult jokes including a couple of instances of bad language but nothing terrible.<br /><br />Kept my family and I entertained two weekends in a row!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Honestly I had to read it myself, just to see what the hype was about. I agree with most of the reviews, it repeats itself over and over. It es quite boring actually.
0062068423|4.0|Excellent, well-written, tight story line. I find it difficult to find mystery/suspense novels as good as this one. I look forward to reading all of Jo Nesbo's books. I particularly liked the blunt depiction of the choices Norwegians had to make in the face of seven long years of occupation and exploitation in WW2 and the fact that there was no reliance on a black and white depiction of the value of the choices made.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Kathy Reichs has done it again - another riveting novel featuring our favorite characters - Brennan and Ryan.  From the first few pages, I was glued.  Death of infants is a hard sell as a plot line, yet it's done in such a way that you become completely absorbed by the twists and turns you travel getting to the answer.  I love the relationship of all the characters and the depth of development that is invested in each and every novel.  It's absolutely worth spending time in Temperance Brennan's world...
B007PP2J9I|5.0|READ THIS BOOK IF YOU LIKE A GOOD NOVEL!!!<br /><br />This book was even better than Zero Day!!  It was great to read more about Daryl and Jeff, two of the main characters from Zero Day, however, Trojan Horse is even more intriguing, and it stands alone!  It is unusual for me to be more captivated by a sequel than by the original, but I found myself losing track of time as a read this at record speed!<br /><br />The pace of the book is as captivating as the plot.  It reveals even more of the intracacies of cyber-terrorism.... the hospital scene that opened up in the beginning of the book reminded me of scenario that may one day be depicted on an episode of House.... Yes, it was that well-written!<br /><br />At any rate, as a society, we are so tied into technology and need to be more cognizant of what that means in the event of a cyber-attack, and once again Mark delivered a very real and very compelling account of why this needs to be addressed, and at the same time it was very entertaining - best case scenario is that this never happens and we are left with a \\"what if.... Mark had never educated us and entertained us with something that changed the course of cyberterrorism....\\"<br /><br />A MUST READ FOR SURE!!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|First time I  read that Jack reacher is getting old. The book is OK, but the end/ climax is a bit wierd and confusing, or should I say too far out.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|I finally found a epub reader that works on the kindle. I need to clarify that. It works on my kindle fire(6) but not on my kindleHD.I am now having second thoughts on wisdom of buying the Firehd. This plus many of my other apps<br />likewise do not work.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a fantastic book to read it just draws you in the moment you begin to read. I couldn't put it down!! You will love this book its a must have. Enjoy I did.
B000V674E8|5.0|Although not their most well known album, still an essential cover to cover album for every Supertramp fan. It gets five stars in my book!
B007SGM084|5.0|Had not heard all the controversy about the book nor the rave reviews.  Purchased it more on a fluke but boy was I glad that I did.  This book was hard to put down.  It made ma laugh, cry and  showed another side to life I had not really understood.  The depth of each of the characters was wonderful and entrancing.  Had to laugh that my 30 year old daughter \\"laughingly refused to discuss this book with me\\".  Really enjoyed all three of them.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to re-vitalize a relationship or just enjoy a great book.  Still trying to find which character the author wrote herself into.  :)

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is a book for men, if all you want is an inside look at men at work, preparation for war, and dedication to duty.  The minimum qualification for acceptance into this elite fraternity is completion and acceptance into one of the existing special forces communities: Navy Seals, Army Rangers, etc. Only about a third of those accepted into Green Team training are actually able to complete the program to the end. These are the kind of men we want and need to fight the terrorist threat around the world.  They are hard, rough men, trained hunters with an almost fanatical sense of mission.  The  author's descriptions of the kinds of missions he was personally involved in does not, in my opinion, give away much about tactics, arms or means.  If anything, this holding back of the intimate  details of a mission  left me wondering if I had skipped a page.  For example, in an engagement involving the rescue of a container ship's captain kidnapped off the coast of Somalia, the team was tasked, arrived, the pirates shot by snipers, the captain rescued and the team had gone back home. By far, the best story is that of the attack on Usama bin Laden.<br /><br />The second story is the political story.  If this had not involved UBL, the book would have been a non-starter, but the post mission leaks of information started only four hours after the assault team made their radioed report that they had succeeded in killing UBL,  Leaks that included the loss of  one of the helicopters with advanced avionics, blow by blow details of the teams change of plan in mid assault, and even the identity of those involved in the gathering of pre-op intelligence.  These leaks continued over a fairly long period of time and even involved the Secretary of Defense who begged the White House to stop the leaks because they were compromising the safety of future missions and the lives of the assault team members and their families.  And, as the author points out, all of the leaked information waswrong and that's what led him to write his book.<br /><br />The third story, is really the political after-story.  The Defense Department now accuses the author of violating his Non-Disclosure agreement and may have compromised Seal Team operations and tactics.  It has been reported that former Seal Team members have ostracized the author because of an agreement, formal or otherwise, not to write or profit from their experiences, even though the author has said that most of the profits will go to support the families of operators who have been killed and to Wounded Warriors.<br /><br />I give this book a four star rating because it is a story honestly told in the face of powerful criticism and opposition.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|Purchased on one of these.  It was pretty easy to install the chip, the memory, a DVD drive, and SSD drive.  I really like the build of this unit and it is incredibly quiet.  I also like the smaller size.  My previous computer like others was a huge tower, and there was always a fan running that you could hear.  With my new shuttle, it is like a new level of quiet I never knew existed.  I'm very happy with it and hope my buying quality components it will last for a long time.  UPDATE: It's 12/29/2013 and I've had my unit for 15 months and it is still super-solid.  Quiet as ever - just the tiniest fan hum.  I'm going to replace the other computer in the house (aptly named Frankenstein) and I'm 99% sure it's going to be another Shuttle.  UPDATE2: It's not 6/2/2015 and I had a problem with Windows shutting down when I inserted anything in the front two USB 2.0 ports.  I can use the 3.0 port or the ones in back, but the other ones are off limits unless I want the blue screen of death.  Also, I am not tech savvy enough to update the BIOS, I wish there were step-by-step instructions for that.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I liove all the Bones books. This one is no my favorite but I really did enjoy it and just hope KR keeps them coming.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love the game, very addicted to it.  Play all day if can. Download this game from Amazon, you will love it.
B007L6VQHW|5.0|I was excited for the movie when I saw that it starred the phenomenally talented Tom Hardy. My hopes were high, but wasn't sure what to expect. It was better than I ever could have imagined. The entire cast was stellar. It was so well paced throughout the entire film. It was suspenseful, dramatically engaging, and humorous at the perfect moments. The violence was very intense and realistic. Couldn't speak more highly of this film. It's a must see!
B008D28HYS|3.0|I downloaded and installed the CrossMe Color App onto my Samsung Stratosphere without any difficulty.  The application runs well and is easy to use.  My only issue is that my phone has a large screen, but I still have difficulty selecting the appropriate box.  The application makes it easy to zoom in/out, but once zoomed in, you can't easily see the number queues on the side of the game board.<br /><br />I'd quickly recommend this game for those that want a challenging, unique puzzler game AND have a tablet.  The easier levels are fine for a smartphone, but screen size quickly becomes a limiting factor just as your are getting the hang of the game.  Not recommended for smartphones of any size.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I have been playing the game for a few months on my iPhone and loved it...until it kept freezing on me.  I decided to not wait for the game update to come out which was supposed to fix the problem and downloaded it for my Kindle Fire.  On the surface it looked better, seeing it on a larger screen and being able to do things without squinting.  The gameplay is identical, the graphics and quest are the same and purchasing and building look and feel the same too.  The major difference in the two games is the \\"free money\\" options.<br /><br />On the Apple version you get about 10 free dollars a day by watching videos for other games you can download from Gameloft.  Having money in the game (not the coins you get from rent or quest, the money that appears like real dollars) is required to purchase needed \\"luxury items\\" and more efficient tools like a better ax or shotgun.  Of course you can purchase money packs from $4.99 to $99.99, but I'm not to crazy about spending that kind of money for a game after I purchase it (I know it's a free download, but you get my point). Anyhow, the option to watch videos to get free money isn't available in the Kindle version.<br /><br />So to summarize, if you don't mind spending real money to purchase things in the game, or if you just want to play with the less efficient tools and no \\"luxury items\\" then this is a good game for you.  It will keep you busy and engaged for hours on end!
0805095535|3.0|A personal reflection on his life but not one I could relate to. A bit boring.  Also rather marose.  Is he depressed? Perhaps he  should take better care of himself.
B003UAHIM0|5.0|A must see movie. It is a riot. I my opinion one of Mel Brooks top two movies, number one being Young Frankenstein. Its one of those movies you can watch again and again.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it! The set is massive considering the extensiveness of how many episodes they filmed. It's perfect for killing time, on trips, or just to relax with. The DVD booklet that ships with the set is actually very nice! Pictures and stories from the cast/crew are fun to read and highlight some of the fun times spent filming the series.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|My daughter loves it!  She listens to it none stop.  Buying music for her on her Kindle was fast and easy.  I will do it again.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|A very sobering story about ALS with a great expression and lesson about life's most important values.  The author has a special ability to bring one personally into the experience.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Everyone deserves a Travis.. This book was an easy read and enjoyed it Cant wait till April when the next one comes out.
B00846REIS|4.0|Liked it but not the characters as much as Christian and Ana in Fifty shades.  Book is very similar though.  Just couldn't connect with characters the same.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I get so many great DIY projects, home decorating ideas, recipes and much much more from Pinterest. I'm constantly checking it through out the day! Love love love it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are interesting and just difficult enough. I like the variety as well as the ease of use. I would recommend it.
B003NX76BM|4.0|This is a must read for those who believe that dogs are truly man's best friend. Not only does this book have romance and suspense, it also demonstrates how much dogs assist us in our lives.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey has become a family favorite.  We all can't wait for the next season!!  So very well done!  Each character has so much detail.  You want to see what happens with each one.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Thank you to Michael Connelly for Mullholand Dive, we can have his wonderful writing until the release of his next book at the end of the year.  Cant have enough!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I love action movies with a twist.  With Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg in the same movie directed by Martin Scorsese, how can you go wrong?  Great ending!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Each book was better than the last which made #3 the best.  Fast moving, kept my interest, etc.  All the things a good book should do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this novel, enjoyed the suprises and the dual inside their head's style of writing.<br />Did not expect most of the twists, captivating book.
B00866JL96|5.0|This was a good movie.  It took a bit to get into it but it was good.  Any movie by Nichlos Sparks is great.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|this game is so much fun and it is so cool it is definitely worth the money it is so cool how it can guess what you are thinking
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is sad movie about a spouse dying, but a touching one.You watch the progress of time and emotion after someone losses their life partner.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I purchased the 10th Anniversary Concert from Amazon some time ago and have watched it several times. This newer version is brilliant also, but I miss Alun Armstrong and his 'Master Of The House'. But,<br />this updated version has magnificent voices and acting and the addition of two of my favorites, Alfie Boe and Ramin Karimloo. This DVD is a MUST for any true lover of musical theatre! And Amazon offers it at an exceptional price!
B007ATNHLI|5.0|We love Si-Fi and this series has not disappointed us.  We have enjoyed the not so serious aspect of MIB and are looking forward to MIB III. Thank you so much for the positvie experience we've had ordering thru you...
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The characters have a complex personality that you want to keep reading about to try and understand. Combining that with a use of the Victorian language of flowers was a great way to bring the complexities together. Loved this book!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this book in one day. Excellent book the truth has been told to the public. There should be more people out there to let the truth come out to the public. As for our troops there doing and excellent job keep it up.
B007JRU4N0|5.0|There is not much I can say without spoilers, but this is a movie to watch.  George Clooney has somehow come from B movie actor, to being one of the best stars to watch.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't see what all the hullabaloo is about. It is quite clear \\"Mr. Mark Owen\\" made a sincere effort to safeguard the military secrets he was entrusted with while at the same putting his readers in boots on site. A well written \\"page turner\\".
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|Not your typical action film...it's a little slower paced at points, the acting isn't amazing but that doesn't really matter because the fighting is so cool! She really knows what she's doing, and it looks like actual fighting instead of fake action movie stuff.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gave us the real day to day operations the Seals were up against.  Contrary to what others believe, I did not see any government \\"secrets\\" that were given away only things we already knew.<br /><br />I do not think the author embelished any situation and wrote from the heart.  This is a first hand account of what was happening as it evolved. It had to be a frightnihg experience for him and I applaude his bravery!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books! They are a great easy read and kept me wanting more! If you are offended by graffic sexual details then these are not the books for you. However, there's more to the story than graphic sex.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|one of the best books I ever read about the Seals. Ive read no less than 10 and this book ranks up there in the top two. I am so thankful for warriors like this man. God bless the USA!
0425263908|2.0|I read this book after the reviews recommended it after reading fifty shades of grey......what a waste of time! The book was not well written, I mean it didn't flow well. it was hard to follow where the storyline was going. Some of the details were too similar to fifty shades which made me question the originality of it.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I read the series after the movie came out, but before I saw it.  While the books are fairly entertaining, this is for me one of the rare occasions where the movie is better.  If I'm not mistaken, the novels were aimed at a youthful demographic.  If so, this could be the cause of my boredom.  I'm old.
B0091UAEA6|4.0|A very good movie, with a little bit for everyone.  Action, drama, love story all wrapped up in one.  And pretty amazing to see what these Marines do.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Wife did not like the ending of this last book. BUT she enjoyed the first two. I heard the stories are pretty raunchy. I wonder how a producer will make a movie out of this. It might be rated X...LOL.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Moran tries to be funny about some topics (and bits of it are laugh out loud), but what this memoir does better than anything else is make feminism accessible. It speaks to women coming-of-age, and seeks to make feminism relevant (why DO we spend more time worrying about female circumcision than the societal expectation that women must dress or act a certain way to be relevant?). In this, the work succeeds. She wins the argument for why men and women should not only be feminists, but vocal ones.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Light, quick, summer reading.  Quite entertaining, as per previous books sexually explicit areas become a little repetitive. A fun read .
B0014D6PCO|5.0|After years of comical often ridiculous Batman movies, Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins set the standard for what a comic superhero movie should look like. Gritty, realistic within the parameters of the superhero's universe looks like. It is not the best movie of the trilogy, but the trilogy would not be as great as it is without this beginning. Overall, it's a superb movie.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|A fun, quick summer read for someone who is looking for 'harlequin' type novels with a lot of sexually explicit expansion.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was amazing!  I loved that I found this book right after I finished 50 shades of grey trilogy...it was a great transition book.  I cannot wait for the next book to be released.  I will definitely purchase it on the exact release date!!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|this app is ok because it craches every time you open it but it was fine before that it was awesome it is a very entertaining but it will crash right when you open it
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Great movie for the whole family with a strong and important message which it delivers in a fun way.<br /><br />Loved it.
0425263908|2.0|Being on the NY times bestseller list I was beyond ecstatic to purchase this novel and dive into what I thought was going to be a great book. After a while I became slightly annoyed with the main character and how predictable she became. The book lacked a good plot, and I found the main character to be a little annoying! I know its an opinion, but I can assure others would agree that her attitude/decisions were a bit cliche!! Unfortunately not satisfied with my purchase :\
B0087HT36U|4.0|good entertainment! easy gameplay with enough challenge to keep you coming back. looking forward to more levels in the (hopefully) near future...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thanks to friends in dark places, I am confident that this is a true and faithful account of one of the most important \\"special\\" operations of the 21st century.  What I do not understand is the kerfluffle about the book in certain political circles.  The author seems to have taken pains to assure that his book is apolitical.  I certainly found it so.<br /><br />If you wish to gain some insight into the sort of \\"rough men\\" that allow us to sleep comfortably in our beds at night (with apologies to George Orwell), this is one book you should study.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Expected a lot more from the book.  Found it to be very formula.  I did not conect with the characters and did not find any chemistry between the main characters.  Overall not going to be rushing to read another Grisham novel any time soon.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to share this story with the world.  So many horrible things happened to this child, yet she has somehow managed to grow into a strong and loving person in spite of them.  This book has changed the way that I view the world.  Now, I am much more aware of my surroundings and ready to report anything that seems out of the ordinary. I sincerely hope Parole Officers conduct future property searches with her abduction and imprisonment in mind, as well.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|If you like Civ & Tower defense, \\"UniWar HD\\" is a simple game you will enjoy.  (Gets me a quick, Civ4-type fix, in a short, easy way.)
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was a well thought out and well written novel.  I had a hard time putting it down.  One of my favorite books ever!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The matter of fact storytelling is great. The things seals can do is nothing short of amazing. Knowing these guys are on our side is comforting!
B004FOA84A|2.0|I can't believe I spent actual money on that, let alone time. Game play itself was cute, and the graphics were good, but otherwise not a great investment. Not only were some clues completely non-intuitive, but it took all of an hour to get through. That's it. I would have hoped it would take at least a few hours to justify the price, but no. And it's not as if I'm some skilled gamer who whips through games day in and day out. I'm very much a casual, infrequent game-player, yet this was mostly way too easy for me. You're not missing much, believe me.
B0090EKRKU|1.0|It was a turn off of children's movies. It seems like most children's movies these days are being used to push some political point into my kid's heads. I'm sick of it, and I am going to be more careful of the movies I show my children from now on.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love Angry Birds.  I always got the \\"free\\" version, before.  The ads were a pain in the rear end.  There was always a possibility of accidentally hitting the ad.  Then it would take you out of the game, and on the web.  And then there was the \\"data\\" issue.  Every ad used data.<br /><br />There was a promotion where the \\"Paid, ad free\\" version was offered for Free.  I took it.<br /><br />Next time, I won't wait to get the paid version.  It is so much nicer!  No interruptions.  No worries about data usage.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor...Get this \\"paid\\" version!
B0071FBARY|5.0|I recently scored some tickets to watch The Fray live promoting their album, Scars and Stories.  Honestly, I had not heard any songs from this album before the concert.  I was absolutely blown away by the show and I purchased this album the very next day.  Scars and Stories has become one of my favorite 'unwinding time' albums that I play on my Kindle Fire when I am preparing to drift off to sleep.  This isn't bubble-gum-no-substance music.  It's thinking music.  It's heart music.  Listen between the lyrics and you will hear a gentle wisdom that's easily entreated.  There's experiential knowledge shared in every verse.  Great stuff!
B00000JSJC|4.0|This is the only racially conscious sci fi movie that I've ever seen so it scores some points on that account for originality. This movie was made four years after the Rodney King riots so I suppose at the time people had a real fear of a racial violence. Part of the foreboding dystopian mood of the film is a sense of an impending race war as the new millennium approaches. Added to the mix is ethically questionable technology that allows people to experience other people's memories, and a psychopath who rapes and kills women and records the murders on snuff videos. You can probably tell the plot careens into many directions. This might have worked smoothly had the screenwriter not been James Cameron (Titanic, Avatar). Still, it's a worthwhile movie. Its socially conscious messages aren't perfect, but few movies even tackle this territory. The acting is at many points laughable. Angela Basset is the best in the cast. As an actress she's been great and over the top, and she's both in this movie. Some scenes work, some don't. So, overall, the movie is a mixed bag, but even if you consider it a train wreck, it's an interesting and unforgettable one.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I have enjoyed the entire series and hope Rollins continues,,,Very moving. Action, history and a great cast of repeat characters, that are likable and believable.  I like the interaction, between the main characters, knowing they care, but not going into the bedroom details, where not needed.. It is about the hunt.. I also really enjoy, where he goes into detail, at the end of each book, about facts and fiction.. Just great reading....
B000FCK65W|5.0|Of all things, I discovered this book while watching the Tom Hanks/Spielberg Mini-Series Band of Brothers. Picante is handed the book by a fellow soldier who is asked, is it full of blood and guts and gets the answer, it's not that kind of book. Rather it is about a smart young girl growing up in a tough tenement neighbourhood of Brooklyn who at one point assumes a fake home address so she can get into a better school. Reputed to be autobiographical the book is told matter-of-factually without pathos or appeals for sympathy. If it isn't on every high school reading list already it should be.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This game is definitely mindless fun. The graphics are cool & colorful. Good for both kids and adults. I often let my grandson (who is 7) play the games on my Kindle Fire and he enjoys it too. Love IT!!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|First met this show in an online preview of Episode One at a nameless competitor. Since I grew up 20 miles from Lunenburg the filming location for this show the hair stood up on the back of my head the moment I started watching it. The views of the harbour are classic and the aerial shots give a whole new perspective on a town I know and love. Camped in Lunenburg this summer up the street from where the Bluenose II is being rebuilt and walked the harbour where Duke's boat lies docked with a for sale sign. Town Hall subs as the police station.<br /><br />Those personal attachments aside the series employs great Canadian actors the two male leads being standouts. Anyone who has gone down to the sea in ships knows that superstition and faith take over when man loses control and despite the most advanced technology man is still powerless to control the sea. Half-million ton ships still plow straight into rogue waves off the Cape of Good Hope and vanish forever. Ships like the Mary Celeste show up sailing themselves with crews that vanished without a trace. Among people who try to make sense of the inexplicable ghosts and hauntings are commonplace. Some of the storylines here begin to strain suspension of disbelief but on the whole are not too far removed from reality. The episode in Season 2 based on the plagues of Egypt taken from Exodus is a case in point. Highly recommended. If it succeeds this show should do wonders for tourism in a World Heritage Community. Weekly it makes me homesick for Lunenburg, Mahone Bay, Chester, and Hubbards.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|First off, have to give a big thanks to Nomad for not using and ridiculous permissions. This app doesn't have any permissions at all, actually. Honestly, this game looked boring on the surface but don't judge a book by its cover! This game is quite entertaining. It's similar to Tetris with falling blocks that you have to put together to add up to the aweSUM number. After you make enough &quot;matches, &quot; the aweSUM number will change. The game is designed to not always give you the blocks that you need. You'll have to use the block switchers which changes the numbers on the falling block. Earn more switchers by creating aweSUM combos. There are also two bonus blocks that will help you. The first one can remove every number on the board it touches and the second one can remove an entire row or column. The graphics are simple and clean but the music is a little annoying. Thankfully you can lower music and sound effects or just turn them off completely. I had no problems with the controls on my phone. Simply tap to rotate the falling block and then swipe it in the direction you want it to go. As for storage, this app can be moved to the SD card which I like. Some phones don't have external storage, but as long as there are phones that do, this should be an option. The only problem I found with this game is that even every few minutes it would freeze for about 10 seconds. I didn't lose my progress and the game continued on. This happened even while I was reading the help menu, so I think it's the game and not my phone. Overall I like this game and look forward to an update that increases its stability.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I love this game, it's seriously one of my favorite games!  it did take me a while to get into it, but once you get the hang of it it's very fun and addicting!  I can't wait until they add some more levels!  highly recommended!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great Book!!!!I have read all of Ken Folletts books and they are a piece of our history we should know. Carolyn Taylor I am reading this on My Kindle
B0090EIILU|1.0|Don't bother...if you expected something equivalent to Borat, or Sacha's Ali G work, you'll be terribly disappointed. I hope this qualifies for twenty, non-repeated words.
B000NY12LO|5.0|The bullying weighed heavily on my heart.  I have teenage boys, one says this stuff doesn't happen, but the other relays stories all the time of similar events.  Also, Josie's romance with Matt was very disturbing.  I know many girls feel powerless in these situations.  I think it would be a great read for teenagers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing and I hope there is others sequels to the book.  A must read for everyone.  Can't stop reading it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|While the eroticism is quite potent, it seems there is a lot of filler w/the \\"Inner Goddess\\", as well as the emails--yet those are somehow entertaining.  It's a fairly good read. (Would not suggest to \\"sexually inhibited\\" people, as it may be too much--over the top.)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing and I hope there is others sequels to the book.  A must read for everyone.  Can't stop reading it.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Was a good spur of the moment movie. However, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater. Overall a good watch.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It was a distinct pleasure to read this book. I could not put it down. After all the fallacious stories I read from the Government, it was great that a Seal had the guts to write it as it really happened. I have the utmost respect for these warriors and feel that they are really not given their due. It is evident that these warriors are dedicated Americans and I feel that we do NOT award them their just due. I am envious of their abilities and dedication. This is a book for ALL americans to read and understand. It was also a blessing that I could get this book for my Kindle and for this I thank Amazon----keep up the good work.
B009329Y30|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was well-acted and entertaining.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys \\"love stories\\".
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was hooked throughout the book. I read it faster the the other two. It wraps up the series and leaves you happy.
B00493E1GI|3.0|EPL is the consummate \\"chick flick\\". The theme is that of a young woman searching for inner self and how she learns about life while traveling around the world. The locations are great visually but the characters are saccharin sweet. The ending was fairly predicable. I would not watch this show again, let alone pay for it, but my wife liked it. I can tell because she actually managed to stay awake for the entire program.
B004LROUNG|1.0|I had not read a Grisham book in a while because I think they are written on about a 3rd grade level. However, I decided to give his work another shot. I am a lawyer myself and enjoy good legal thrillers. But, the definition of insanity is doing the same things over and over and expecting a different result. This was no different.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I'm a puzzler fan at heart and love trying to figure out where a color block goes. There are alot of CrossMe's to solve. I'm still on the easy levels. Works great on the Kindle Fire.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's ok. gets a little boring. Same old things over and over. I know Asa loves Christian and I know Christian loves Asa. Ho Hum
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Philippa Gregory's latest entry in the War of the Roses saga is neat because she approached it from Anne Neville's point of view, which must be pretty underserved in this overhashed period of Medieval English history. I also appreciated Gregory pumping the brakes on all of her waterwitch Melusine exposition. That is one overworked, tired bit of imagery, and I'm glad of the absence in this side of the cousins' war.<br />Maybe the most salacious revelation in this novel for me was the bit where George and Richard had Anne's very much alive mother declared dead so they could divvy up the Warwick fortune once Lord Neville was struck down in battle. Anne consents (rather readily) to have the poor woman placed under vigorous house arrest in a separate tower of her own former castle--a neat bit of Mother-in-law housing by Slick Richard 3.<br />Who's next on the Philippa Gregory docket--Princess Elizabeth? Back to the waterwell, I guess. When on her game, none can touch Ms Gregory for well-written plot tension and first-person female narrative (try the Wideacre trilogy).
B004HD61KE|4.0|Interesting historical fiction? Written well as are all James Rollins books. A great read! He is the master of historical fiction and translates them through his main characters from Sigma Force novels.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought American Sniper took you inside the mind of one of America's top fighting men.  It gives you a real life perspective of the men who fight for our country and the committment and sacrifice it takes to become a Navy Seal Sniper as well as the sacrifice of the loved ones at home who have to do most things at home alone.  It was a very easy read and does a great deal to bolster the respect for the men on the ground, a truely enlightening and informative book. I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to not only get the perspective of the soldier but also the soldiers wife.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Great buy ! Must have for any Rocky Fan! Massive extra content ! Box set is out of this world with great pictures from this classic movie !! Beyond happy with purchase ! Don't dream it be it !
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After seeing first movie had to have the book so i bought all three, could not put books down until finished.  Need to have more books like this.
0385344333|2.0|As many of the other reviewers have said, this book is a disappointment.  The writing is lazy, repetitive, and simplistic.  It is written as if the reader needs every detail explained laboriously.<br /> Child has also fallen into the formula trap, his last few books are simply the same basic story over and over.  Reacher gets caught up in a situation, he has to flex his muscles to intimidate, and in the end, miraculously escapes after killing the bad guys.  Fans deserve better, and as someone else has said by agreeing to have Tom Cruise play Reacher it is all about \\"show me the money\\"!!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|What a great album from Linkin Park. They never disappoint and they have stayed true to making amazing music! I have liked them from day one and will continue supporting them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first and then read the book. The book didn't disappoint! I can't wait to read the others in the series.
B007ELN8Y8|1.0|I was only able to view the first 12 minutes at which time a circle in the center of the screen began to turn and the screen stated \\"loading\\" for the next 20 minutes at which time I terminated the session.<br /><br />I hear that the movie won lots of academy awards.<br /><br />Best, Tim
B001NBEWN6|5.0|As a multi-generational work of fiction set in India, the characters' psychological development and family dynamics could be true of any family, anywhere.  The cultural environment is richly descriptive.  This author is amazing.
B00932A2MC|5.0|Lots of action all the way through the whole movie It keeps you interested You won't go to sleep<br />I liked it so well I bought it
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|helps teach cause and effect to children as well as management of two activities at once (when there are mutiple spiders that you have to keep track of).<br />challenging even for adults.<br />great strategy game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I SO loved these books! I read all 3 (you HAVE to read all 3, it's a continuing story) and immediately started I over and read them all again! I miss Christian & Ana now!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Is it just me, or is the dialogue just outstanding? This has to be one of my favorite book adaptations in the world.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Got introduced to this book by my brother and I can't put the series down.  Buy each next book in the series as soon as I finish them.  I love how he explains the world using mythology and legends. Very entertaining.  I'll be sad when I finish this series. :)
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I find it very useful and really like the ability to share across my mobile devices.  I am still learning the product.  what would be nice is the ability to easily save and make a list of generated passwords.
B001EC2ISA|2.0|I know this was supposed to be some great funny movie, but I just didn't get it. It started off OK, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were fine, but it just got boring. I couldn't see the point of the movie, even in retrospect. Why make this movie? Plus, the Michael Keaton character was so annoying, I just wanted to go away. I know he was supposed to be annoying, so fine, he did a good job with that, but I don't want to have to listen to it. We watched as a family and my 8-year-old son hated it too. My husband liked it. Maybe it's a guy thing, a grown-up guy thing.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I don't know how they think Tom Cruise could even begin to fill the shoes of this character, it is beyond me.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Interesting and pleasant.  Somewhat odd .  Loved the parts using flower meanings and how the character found her calling.  Disjointed in parts.
B009329Y30|4.0|I liked this movie, some parts seemed like they drug on for a few extra minutes but for the most part it was good.
B007RI56NY|4.0|After seeing them a couple of months ago on Letterman, I took advantage of this month's $5 offer on the album.  A good investment.<br /><br />Their music has a unique feel to it.  Love the strong emphasis on the horns.  Several songs off this album will go into my regular ipod rotation.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Teriffic summer read.  Great characters in well written action.  I was somewhat unhappy with the ending, lots of threads left undone.  Highly recommend reading the whole trilogy.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun<br />great if u want to kill time.  takes a while to figure everything out. gives u like twenty puzzles
B008NABUU8|4.0|I love this game and hope they come out with a follow-up!  My only complaints: 1)there are only 2 levels where all building materials are made available - they are the most fun to complete so I was hoping for more and 2) there should be a free build mode or levels where funds to build are unlimited (this would be particularly fun to do across the big canyons!)  Overall, though, well designed game with few bugs (it froze up my Kindle Fire twice over the course of two weeks to complete the entire game).
B009329Y30|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It had a great story line to it and a great cast. My husband even enjoyed watching it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is great it covers the whole screen on the kindle fire and is simple and easy to use. Would definately recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an amazingly good book. There were so many twists in the book you can't figure out who is the protagonist or how it is going to end. Absolutely fantastic writing and worth the money to pick up.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Of all my games, I play this one the most.  It fun and challenging.  The good news is the developers continue to update with great surprises.  Keep up the good work.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|I don't usually write reviews on products I've gotten as I'm far too lazy, however I felt that it was necessary to give a word of warning letting people know that this video player is a waste of your time if you're using the Kindle Fire. It's extremely laggy and the sound quality is terrible. I used the free version and not the paid version, so maybe the paid version runs better but I highly doubt it><br /><br />Anyways, try your luck elsewhere, I know I will
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is written first person, which is my favorite type of writing.  Most importantly it is true, again my kind of book. Great book and I am only half way through it.<br />I received this book for my Kindle in just a matter of a few minutes from Amazon
0525953728|5.0|First; I'd like to thank the author (as well as ALL those who put their lives in danger) in  service of our country.  We owe you a great debt. GOD Bless you!<br />Second; for ridding the planet of UBL/OBL - You have my undying gratitude!<br />Third; Thank you for giving us the Truth.<br /><br />This audio-book was gripping; especially when  the author described the events leading up to, and including, the May 1st/2nd mission.<br />I listened to this book, twice, and heard nothing about the mission that I had not already read/heard in other books, the internet and the media.<br />The DoD will be hard pressed to find anything with which to prosecute the author.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"NO EASY DAY\\".  I even ordered two more Audio CDs as Christmas gifts.  I know the recipients will be thrilled when they unwrap them!<br /><br />GOD Bless our SEALS and GOD Bless America!<br /><br />Denise M. Shae
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Italy, India and Indonesia mixed with food, wine, yoga, and spirtual growth.  Made me laugh and cry and want to be a stronger person.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is an awesome hack n slash rpg and definitely worth the money keep the awesome games coming glu!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is by far the best of the three. It ends perfectly and realistically to the character. Very well written.
0765316994|5.0|Just at its beginning, at its first chapters, I'd already decided to comment how this was a very nice book, with an astute satire and criticism of televised science fiction shows, but in the end this book was much more than that for me. I didn't expect it to be that good, and now and I'm interested in reading other works of John Scalzi. \\"Redshirts\\" is highly recommended!
B0090EIC3Y|4.0|Some, I'm sure, will be very offended by many aspects of this film but I found it very enjoyable.<br />Funny exaggerated reality.
B00932A5QA|1.0|I like Robert A. Heinlein and the first two REAL movies.  If you are a cartoon buff, then maybe this is for you.  I like people in movies - computer generated characters more or less advertised as real actors are very poor.  It works for special effects in high budget movies, but the graphics are not that great in this one.  I will look much more carefully at the credits and whether there are actors or cartoons starring in the movie.  I would have given this a \\"0\\" if it was available.  I watched 10 minutes and turned it off it sucked so bad.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|We enjoyed this movie very much, a great rainy Sunday night! This could be / is the Best \\"Mission\\" yet!
B000RVK1AQ|5.0|I have loved this movie from day one, don't know bout the next one. The best part was  when both riders rode at the end.
B009329ZF2|1.0|a movie. That's about all I can say about it, other than if there were a zero star option, I'd give it that.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Didn't really get this movie at all.  The whole wolf thing confused me. I figured that the wolves would have stopped chasing them once they fed on the other ones. What do I know though, I have never been stranded in the mountains.
B004IFD9HE|5.0|This was such a cute movie. I really love it when I can find a movie that I enjoy watching and that I can still watch with my kids and not feel like a horrible parent! LOL
B008VIKLWA|5.0|Very well done.  Great for families. Sad but nice lesson to be had.  Life has its ups and downs, but when needed, you never know where help may come from. I will watch it over and over.  And tell all to watch.
B0087HT36U|5.0|great game has some issue with freezing on motor photon but fun enough to put up with this great game.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|From the beginning of this book, I kept saying, \\"This is one strange book\\", but I trusted Mitch Albom to deliver and, of course, he did.  When I was 80% finished, I thought, \\"OK, he really is going somewhere\\".<br /><br />This is a book about the power time wields in our lives- not always for good.  What an unusual way to go about telling the story!  But that's Mitch--he always delivers a fantastic story, whether fiction or non.  He is just a fabulous writer and the way he puts words together makes my heart soar!<br /><br />Thanks again, Mitch!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was so good I couldn't put it down!! And I had to PEEL myself away from it when I did have to put it down!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This is a fantastic book series. Great for the whole family from pre-teen to moms and dads! Very imaginative, the author takes you right into the story.
B0014EU5XI|4.0|I enjoyed a lot of the music on this CD, but a few were remakes and they didn't do it for me. A little over half were what I liked. Overall a good buy!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is a surhuman !! He is simply a class runner with integrity and respect for other runners and he is doing all the right things a professional runner should do.  Eating a well balanced diet ect. Every runner should read his book. Excellent book!!! Love it!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|The story was very interesting and spell binding, one of the best fiction stories I have read in a long time. It was a good followup from the 1st book.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|There was a lot of potential from a classic story line and good special effects. It just never went anywhere.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I would rate the first two books at a much higher interest level, I felt Mockinjay lost some of the interesting asspects of the first two books. But all in all all three were worth reading.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I love and read lots of Navy Seal stories. This book is a truthful story of a real event. After reading 40 to 50 fictional stories this book was a real treat.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I borrowed the first season from the library and knew I had to own the second season! Wonderful drama and scenery.
B008RV5K5E|3.0|For years, shows like [[ASIN:B00023E894 Batman: The Animated Series]] and [[ASIN:B003M8NGLC Batman: The Brave and the Bold]] have given us tantalizing glimpses at an animated adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking [[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]. If you had asked me what comic I most wanted to see adapted into The DC Animated Universe, it would have been without question \\"The Dark Knight Returns.\\" Now finally, close to thirty years after its publication, I finally get my wish.<br /><br />And it is ... disappointing.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is one of the greatest American comics ever published. That isn't idle praise. Frank Miller tapped deep into the collective unconsciousness to deliver a myth that continues to be an influence to this day. It is an incredible work of art. And DC had to have known that they needed to treat the story with a little more reverie. I am actually confused at how it got such a poor treatment. There are so many problems with this release, from the main film to the bonus features.<br /><br />First off, and most obvious, is the decision to split the film into two parts. There is nothing behind that but money. DC knows they have a hot property on their hands, so they want to sell it to you twice. But, \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is still only a 4-issue comic, only slightly longer than [[ASIN:B005I5C654 Batman: Year One]] which was adapted to a single film. In order to justify the two-parter, they pad the story. Every scene of dialog is stretched just a little bit further. All of the conversations have just a few more lines thrown in, a few more long pauses. Not only is this awkward, but it completely throws off the pacing of the story. The scene with Commissioner Gordon and Bruce Wayne sharing a drink occupies half a page in the comic, but here it is stretched out into minutes of dialog. And not good dialog. Boring dialog.<br /><br />And the bizarre thing is, they cut out much of the actual great dialog already in the comic--or monologue in this case. All of Bruce Wayne's internal monologue, the very thing that drives the story, that gives depth and meaning to the dystopian landscape, that makes \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" rise above, has been removed. All of his comments on his body, on the weight of age--gone. That famous scene where he does the back-kick? \\"There are seven working defenses from this position. Three of them disarm with minimal contact. Three of them kill. One of them ... hurts.\\" Yeah, we still get that scene, but without the play-by-play. Just Batman kicking the guy behind him.<br /><br />I really don't understand how that decision could have been made. Was there a meeting? Did someone propose \\"Hey! You know all of that great, famous monologue in \\"The Dark Knight Returns? \\" The stuff everyone quotes when they talk about the book? Why don't we just nix that and write a few more scenes of Wayne and Gordon having drinks?\\"<br /><br />Seriously ...<br /><br />And the voice acting. I had the same problem with \\"Batman: Year One,\\" which looked great but just didn't have strong voice actors. Peter Weller does Batman, and I think he pulls it off well. Everyone else though ... Ariel Winter doing Carrie Kelly just doesn't sound right. She sounds like a pampered rich kid, with no edge or spirit. And all of the other voices; I know Miller put in some dialog that is hard to pull off. The Mutant-speak isn't exactly normal English. But these actors sound like a bunch of frat guys doing a parody of \\"gangster talk.\\" It sounds so forced and fake, like they don't believe a word they are saying. When a killer steps up behind you and says \\"I need you mommie. Make me feel safe.\\" it should send a chill down my spine, not a chuckle.<br /><br />Art and animation-wise, things look decent. They didn't try to imitate Miller's style at all, but I am OK with that. I think they could have been more creative with the television cut-scenes, and more moody with their use of shadows, as well as making better use of some of the visual impact of the comic. Gone is the iconic scene of Batman holding the flag-covered corpse of the General. Gone is the scene towards the end of Harvey Dent's face \\"matching.\\" But all in all, the animation is solid, and if this were just a regular Batman animated show I would give it full marks.<br /><br />Now the bonus features (and I am talking about the Blu-Ray here). This is another \\"What were they thinking?\\" moment for me. There is almost nothing here about \\"The Dark Knight Returns.\\" The Carried Kelly feature is cool, talking about a female Robin. But where is the \\"Frank Miller and Batman\\" featurette? Where is the \\"1986: The Year that Changed Comics\\" short? Or something like that. Something to show the impact and gravity of the comic they are adapting. Instead there is an (admittedly interesting) piece on \\"Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story.\\" What? Bob Kane? Umm, that's cool and all, but Bob Kane had nothing to do with this.<br /><br />I have the 25th Anniversary leather-bound edition of \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\"  and it is filled with newspaper articles and stories about the impact the comic had, the firestorm of press it created, how it directly lead to the creation of Tim Burton's [[ASIN:B000B5XOY8 Batman]] film. There is a wealth of material available. I am always amazed at how little effort DC spends on these bonus features to lead people back to the source comics. It's like they don't want to acknowledge Miller's contribution at all, or how this single comic revolutionized the industry. Maybe they are scared of leading people to the original \\"Dark Knight Returns\\"  because then they will see what a poor adaptation this is.<br /><br />Instead we get \\"The Bob Kane Story.\\" Which again, is admittedly cool. It's funny how all of these comics professionals try to tip-toe around the truth, and bite their tongues to keep from shouting out \\"Bob Kane was a jerk!\\" It's even funnier than not all of them succeed. And to hear Stan Lee call someone an egotistical, self-promoting gasbag without even a trace of irony is hilarious. But still, this is \\"The Dark Knight Returns.\\"  I want to hear about Frank Miller.  I want to hear about THIS comic.<br /><br />And the two \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" episodes included: They are about Two-Face. That's cool. But why not \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\"  from \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" or \\"The Battle of the Superheroes\\"  from \\"Brave and the Bold\\" that featured scenes from \\"Dark Knight Returns?\\" I don't get it. Even the cover of this DVD.  Why didn't they use the famous cover from the comic? Sigh ...<br /><br />Am I getting Part 2? Of course I am getting Part 2. Am I going to be disappointed? Yes.  That seems to be par for the course nowadays.ll as making better use of some of the visual impact of the comic. Gone is the iconic scene of Batman holding the flag-covered corpse of the General.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this artist.....adele...adele... and product came sooner than I expected...there's not a day that doesn't go by that I don't get in my car and listen to this artist amazon the great place to buy anything and everything you could possibly want or think of and I love their customer service in the way they  protect you they also protect the vendor....i like that...thank you amazon...witt witt
B009329ZF2|2.0|Lots of things go boom in this movie but not much else. The acting is stilted and the plot transparent. It is unfortunately just another America-saves-the-world-shoot-'em-up movie. The game is way more fun.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Ms Reichs has done it again with this awesome novel!  I simply adore all her work and she did not disappoint with Bones Are Forever.
B00932A2MC|4.0|A modern twist on an old concept.  The back story drug a bit but once the action started it was worth it.  I found myself having to replay battle scenes several times the next day.  Most people seem to love or hate inspirational themes, so if you do not like movies like Armageddon or Rocky than don't bother.
B008ULRY78|5.0|This is the most amazing action movie of 2012, and possibly this decade. Light on plot heavy on martial arts and complete bananas action. Rent it you won't be disappointed.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Loved the book.Found it to provide the ordinary citizen with a view of the personal interactions between Presidents and how their actions affected our long term success.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Lots of fun and cool graphics. Smooth interaction and easy to understand game-play. Tempting to upgrade to the paid version :-)
B000MV8ABS|5.0|It will soon be Halloween season again and time to watch some of my favorite horror movies. My big three are Salem's Lot (1979), Halloween (the original of course), and PHANTASM! The 1970s was the best decade for horror in my opinion and this one is no exception. I can't really compare it to any other classic because it exists in a world all its own. What other movie has The Tall Man, a deadly floating silver ball, and dwarves from another dimension!? My favorite scenes are the finger in the box, when the boy seeks advice from \\"grandmother\\" (was that Ozzy? lol), and when the silver ball first appears. Other than the nasty (rubber) fly the effects are quite good, and the movie at times exists in an eery haze.  If you haven't seen it yet check it out and I hope you enjoy ...BOOOOOOOOOOOOY!
B004SRNH10|1.0|Downloaded this app since some games said required. Now i have several \\"favorite\\" apps that aren't working correctly. Since I am computer illiterate I will have to try and figure out how to get rid of it with losing everything else<br />Not a happy camper....
B008UTV6S8|2.0|Paul Simon is one of the four or five greatest songwriters of the latter half of the 20th century, and has extended that same songwriting quality into the 21st. Unfortunately, listening to these particular performances is a bit of a sad experience, and I had to stop six songs in. Perhaps things get better later, but a dullness to these performances sap the spirit from song after song, too often represented by a flatness of tone (prime example: the horns on Obvious Child) and a creakiness to the guitars and vocals.<br /><br />(Added later: Eventually, days ago, my fan-love for Simon insisted I listen to the album in its entirety, and I found little to contradict my earlier impressions. The exception at last is the final track, Late In The Evening, which has exactly what I was looking for on all of the other tracks: Paul's vocal is amazingly inventive, the band is tight and makes small changes that work, the horns acquitted themselves by being bright and lively, and it's all neither a slavish attempt to sound like the original recording nor a performance that sounds like I have to take Simon's age into consideration. This version of Late In The Evening proves that Simon is capable of what I was hoping to hear, but didn't bring similar chops to the other songs. In light of this, if it gives those of you unnecessarily rushing to his defense in comments a little comfort, imagine that 2-star rating to be 2 1/2 stars.)<br /><br />I do listen with great affection to rock and roll musicians as they age. For instance, I've adored albums late in the careers of Johnny Cash, John Fogerty and Eric Clapton, and need I mention Paul Simon's latest studio album [[ASIN:B005O607U8 So Beautiful Or So What]] was brilliant? But I'm much less willing to sit still for a recording of a musical giant leading a band in live performance which demonstrates he doesn't have the discipline he once had to lead complex band arrangements nor the stamina and strength he once had to sing complex melodies. The audience devotedly responds positively to everything, and if I could put more weight on the quality of these songs over the performances, this would easily be a three or four star review. But three of the four songs from \\"So Beautiful\\" have already appeared (in [[ASIN:B005O607U8 its Collectors Edition]]; only \\"Rewrite\\" is, I believe, previously without an official live recording), and the rest have appeared on live recordings before, most multiple times, all of which invites comparisons.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are some of the best songs written during most of our lifetimes. Unless you were at Webster Hall to witness them, these are not the performances of them we will want to remember.s.

B000ICXQGK|4.0|From a Mans point of view, I extremely liked this movie. I would recommend it to men and women alike. From the start it held my interest and curiousity.

0345522478|5.0|Kevin Hearne popped up on my radar when it was announced at Star Wars Celebration VI that he would be writing a Luke Skywalker novel in a mini-series called Rebels. Being the huge Star Wars fan that I am, and also a voracious reader, I decided to try out one of his books which just so happened to be Hounded. The story that unfolded was one of pure entertainment...and hilarity.<br /><br />First off, Hounded stars a Druid. In this realm of fantasy, a Druid is a being who draws power from the earth and can perform magic. But this isn't your typical fantasy story. The Druid, Atticus, lives in Tempe, Arizona. He has a dog he can talk to and runs a rare book shop. He's around 2,100 years old and on a day-to-day basis, he deals with gods, Fae, and other strange beings. There's a lot of Irish mythology in the book, but the story weaves in werewolves, vampires, and witches as well. Some of the Greek gods get a mention. And just so everyone's on the same page, every god exists in this setting, be it Greek, Norse, Christian, or Muslim. I also really appreciated how the book never takes any jabs at religion but instead gives them all a fair footing.<br /><br />So there's a Druid, a bunch of gods, a talking dog, and it's all set in modern times...what else is there? The simple answer is humor. For Star Wars fans, Kevin Hearne is the equivalent of Aaron Allston on his `A' game. There is a ton of humor in this book. Sometimes it made me smile, but more often than not, I was laughing out loud and having a great time. Who knew a talking dog could be so funny? Honestly, the chemistry between Atticus and Oberon (his dog) is perfect. They're witty and it brings a great angle to the book. Yet even without Oberon, there's some good laughs to be had with all the other characters in the book. For instance there is Flidais and her love of potions, er, strawberry fruit smoothies. The outlandish setup of random gods mixed into modern society is just ripe for humor, and Kevin Hearne doesn't miss a beat.<br /><br />Best yet, the humor goes hand-in-hand with compelling characters and an entertaining story. Atticus has found a cozy little place to live, but he's got enemies. In fact he has a god after him who wants his sword back. Through half a dozen conflicts, Atticus has to fight his way up the ladder of lesser minions to get up to the big guy himself. Along the way, the reader gets introduced to the characters and the world Atticus lives in. There's plenty of laughs, action, and wonderful character dialog that kept me glued to the book throughout.<br /><br />When you come across a really good book, you just chew through it until it's done and cherish every page of joyous escape. Hounded not only helped me escape from reality, but lightened my mood and gave me a burst of energy that recharged my batteries. I'm fully ready to chug on to the next book and tear through this series from beginning to end. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but if you like to read and have a good laugh, this is a book I highly recommend.ss a beat.<br /><br />Best yet, the humor goes hand-in-hand with compelling characters and an entertaining story.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|This was my second Kate Morton book; the first being \\"The Distant Hours.\\"  Both were multi-generational, family history mysteries. It didn't take me long to figure out the mystery, but it was still a fun read.  Even though it is a fairly lengthy book, it was a fast read.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I loved this book - couldn't put it down.  I would have given it a higher rating, but I really did not like the ending.
B008XG1X18|4.0|For someone like me it is an easy app to learn. Pretty straight forward.<br />I love the household cleaning tips and art projects. There is something for everyone on there.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written, easy to read. Was very interesting and took me less than 2 days to finish reading Thanks
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Night Circus is at once hypnotic , methodical, poetic and in the truest sense magical.  Morrison's prose and intricately crafted story is what writing must always be:  an art form  Exquisite!
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Windup girl is a fantastic story on par with Gibson's Neuromancer. Excellent prose, solid characters and an unbeatable setting. Do yourself a favor and download the sample Kindle book if you'd like to dip your toe. Otherwise, buy it and count on a couple late nights.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|This is a suspenseful story set in London that is entertaining to the end.  Couldn't wait to finish it since all the twists and turns kept me guessing.  Good character development as well as good description of surroundings.  The author did a great job of keeping the reader interested as well as very curious.  Loved the ending.
B00132D808|5.0|and i love it, and i would do the same with all their resources, I finally listened to this after 4 years and I finally understand it. When i was young i was just naive but I'm glad a came back to it as a young adult
B00992CF6W|4.0|the game is awesome. but my house dissapeared! I power off my kindle for one minute and then all of my hard work is gone! please comment some advice! I need my house back!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I literally couldn't put this book down.  It delves into the lives of slaves with heartfelt clarity.  Seeing how the erratic lives of their owners affected their lives, and how they adjusted and made decisions based on what made sense was fastinating.  It was sad to see how the bad decisions of the owners could devistate the security of the slaves.  I highly suggest that this book is a must read!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a very entertaining and engaging story, particularly if you've lived through the heyday of PC and gaming technology.
B003YQ1QUA|5.0|This album just shows the depth of her talent, every song is so well crafted and executed. But the star song of this CD is Apple Blossom IMO. But you can not go wrong getting this ablum at all, jazz fan or not, this is a great album.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Good old fashioned Spider Solitaire. Exaclt what I was looking for. Recommended for everyone. Works great on my Kindle. :)
1401324649|5.0|I read the book in Hebrew before it was published in English, and it was a fun and easy to read. The writer was able to build the story around historical events and insert the main character into the historical event in a smart and humorous way.<br />I already bought 2 books on Amazon as gifts and I highly recommend it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love this app!!!!!!!!!! I hope they format for Apple products sooner rather than later!!!!!  Please! :-) Until then, keep up the good work!
B008BIN9EW|3.0|Initially put out there it worked great on my device. Then later when I went to reinstall it, it tells me it is incompatible with the device. Emailed author and amazon both and neither responds. Through forum reading I find out that the author only wants it to work on Kindle Fire and they have no intention of refunding anyone who may have bought the game already for another device.<br /><br />see http://www.amazon.com/gp/cd/m/Fx3UX6H5NAKPTDO/-/Tx24ZR1976VXZ2B/1/Mx95JMEK8HHX5I and http://www.amazon.com/gp/cd/m/Fx2SGDMVDJVXTR3/B008BIN9EW/Tx37RBWRC9JSK40/1/Mx12H2M0ESF08U2 for examples where dozens of people suffer the same thing and the authors are blatantly ignoring everyone about it.<br /><br />Update: The author has updated the product to work with non-kindle phones again. Bumped up the stars but not as much as I would have liked to cause it still just leaves a bad taste in the mouth that it happened to start with and for such an extended period of time.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|Again, if you like Rush, you most likely love this release. I've had Moving Pictures on vinyl, cassette and CD (which, again, my kids destroyed). One of my favorite albums ever - 'nuff said.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've always enjoyed science fiction stories, but I've been accustomed to the common story lines ... aliens invading earth, interstelllar and time travel, etc.  All of these themes are enjoyable to me, but becoming worn out.  While I felt like it took some time to really begin enjoying Wool, as the first chapters always left me feeling sad, I felt it was an investment that proved very worthwhile.  Numerous twists and turns in the story always kept me surprised and interested, and while I won't ruin anything, I found the ending very satisfying.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, and other novels by this author.  - David, Indianapolis.
B000W1YYSQ|5.0|If you like Rush, you will love this album. IMO one of their classics, I've owned it on vinyl, cassette, and CD (which my kids ruined). If you don't, you probably aren't reading this review anyways!
B009329ZF2|4.0|No more implausible than many other sci-fi action flicks.  Great entertainment as long as you can suspend reality for a bit.
B007SSDS24|1.0|This movie was horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  Did I mention that the movie was horrible?  If I did not, it was. I cannot believe that Amazon actually charged me for this.  This was 100 times worse than the movies they let me watch for free via Prime.<br /><br />EDIT:  nearly one year later, my kids and I still laugh at how horrible this movie was. When we see a bad movie it is always couched in the terms \\"was it worse that the Darkest Hour?\\"
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love, this sight! I have got so many new ideas for gifts. I totally love the recipes on here. Can't wait to try all of them!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|If your just looking to read or you really like zombies READ THIS BOOK!!! The book is funny yet true to a point of logic. This book is great i give it 10 stars but i can only give it 5!!!
B0087HT36U|3.0|Not a bad little app. The physics are pretty good. Nice way to waste a few minutes here and there. Replay value is about medium since some of the reactions rely a bit on luck.
B0087HT36U|5.0|very clever game. the multiple ammo types are great and it was just challenging enough to provide a distraction from work
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A captivating look at the life of a Navy Seal and at several well known missions. We now know what it was like to be a Seal Team member on the night Bin Laden was taken down.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|I saw this movie years ago and while the story was dramatized a little for the movie, I felt that it really conveyed the feelings and experiences of the people involved in the real event. I purchased this DVD as a gift.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I would imagine that a screenplay version of book would either be MOST enjoyable to those who have read the book or to new comers. With this movie, I'm not sure who it is supposed to appeal to. The movie is so rushed in trying to cover the events of the book that there is absolutely no time to develop the characters or build any context to the plot. If you've read the books, then you know that there was still a great deal that was left out of the movie. On the other hand, if you haven't read the books, the movie still doesn't properly develop the story because it  attempts to cover so much.<br /><br />The film was very beautiful. It is a fun film in this sense. The special effects, graphics,  and actors do a great job  portraying the melodramatic events of the story. However, there is a constant state of tension. There is not a typical narrative structure that allows the story to build to an enjoyable climax. For example: The opening scene of the Hunger Games (the actual games within the movie) begins with the ring of all of the 24 contestants from the 12 districts. The camera is constantly shaking from the beginning. You don't even get a chance to take in the scene and understand that the 24 contestants are all lined up anxiously awaiting what they know is coming. Instead, the camera jitters around the scene as the events awkwardly begin.<br /><br />I recommend Battle Royale if you want an enjoyable cinematic portrayal of a similar storyline.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|The book started with bang and ended in a fizzle. I was so dissapointed in the route the story took,  the ending was sloppy.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting account compared to official one by government.  Some things in the book did not need to be disclosed.
B007X709PE|5.0|Great follow up to the first movie!! Tons of action. If you're a motoGP FAN THIS IS A MUST!!! Watch it now.
0470876417|4.0|\\"I have my sights set on the post of Post Master General of the Kenya Postal Corporation and I needed to get a better appreciation of how to deal with a multifaceted organisation with vast vested interests.<br /><br />Even though I am still reading the book I have found a way to make the organisation grow without rattling the established interests.<br /><br />This is a must read for any MBA student and graduate as it gives you the new tools that are required to turn an organisation from great to grand.<br /><br />As we embrace outsourcing the only way to benefit from it is to analyse your business and then break it down into it components to isolate what is core and what is not.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it. so much better than  the movie. but i think that katniss should stay with gale their cuter together and better
B002YRZ1VA|5.0|This album is a compilation of some of the best songs of Ms. Chaka Khan. It is very soothing and highlights the best attributes of this artist.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is definitely one of my all-time favorite books. Brandon Sanderson is a true master of the fantasy lit genre and the storm light archive is shaping up to be a major hit!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting first hand account of the planning and execution of the specific mission that lead to the death of Osama Bin Laden.  I also enjoyed the insights into the commitment of the female intelligence officer that tracked him down.  In addition, the book discusses several of the other missions the author participated in over the course of 13 combat deployments, mostly in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I grew to admire the commitment, mindset and professionalism that is part of the daily \\"routine\\" of an elite Navy Seal operator.
B006VSP906|5.0|Wow. I found this book to be eloquent and compelling, despite the difficult topic. It was easy to read and hard to read at the same time. Easy because Hitchens' word choice and style make the reading really flow; hard because the theme and palpable pain and despair were hard for me to witness.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Every American should read about what our men and women in the military go through. This book is a great read!
B005Q1W10A|3.0|I purchased both seasons 1 & 2 in March 2012. Just now, in September, I got around to watching. Good thing I'd already seen the PBS airings because 1 DVD in each set was unwatchable: picture in pixels and no sound. I suppose it's too late to return them. My review has nothing to do with the quality of the programs, I love them; but with the quality of the DVDs. If you make a purchase, check them asap to ensure you have what you paid for.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I love this game. It's all about strategy. It's very addictive. I play it all day long. My five year old plays it, too!
B006G2124E|5.0|The Help was one of the best movies I have every seen- it a definite \\"watch\\"<br />Why Amazon needs more than 20 words for a review is a mystery- I recommend watching this movie it is great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down, despite perhaps stylistic and other writing blemishes.  The subject matter was thoroughly enthralling.  Read the whole trilogy in one go!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Excellent novel many twists and turns and unexpected complications throughout! If you enjoyed the first two the third is the best out of three can't put it down while reading!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This book kept you reading and wondering right up until the end. I feel I would have purchased this book if I had known what it was about.  The main character in the book was relentless.  You will be cheering for him right up until the end.  I enjoyed the book and I recommend it to others that like suspense and different endings.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It has everything for the picky reader - magic, romance, mystery, scholarship and adventure.<br />I loved the character of Dianna - clever, feisty and stubborn, and a perfect foil for Matthew Clairmont, the fourteen hundred year old vampire and Professor of Neuroscience at Oxford.<br />Well, what else would a vampire be?!<br />I'm already downloading the second book in the series - The Shadow of Night.<br />Looking forward to an early night, tucked in bed with my two favourite Oxford dons - Matthew and Dianna.
B005IQZB14|5.0|WHAT A GREAT STORY AND WHAT A COURAGEOUS YOUNG WOMEN. SET IN PLACES WE HAVE GONE TO ALL OF OUR LIVES.  THE WHOLE FAMILY HAS READ OR IS READING THE BOOK NOW.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, I typically only write reviews if something is really really good or really really bad.  Guess which category this falls under?  (Hint: BAD)<br /><br />I'd like to throw out that I am NOT a prude.  I'm not bashing this book because it's about kinky sex.  Kinky sex is fine by me.<br /><br />I'm hating on it because it is SO TERRIBLY WRITTEN.  My friends and I read this book out loud to each other and just about died laughing - somehow, the writing becomes even worse when spoken out loud.  I'd quote some passages for you but my head might explode from STUPID.<br /><br />And besides the ridiculously bad writing and dialogue, I reject the premise of this book in its entirety.  An average-looking, nothing-special-about-her girl catches the attention of a gorgeous, handsome, successful, billionaire playboy?  Please.  Everyone knows that hot people have sex with other hot people!  I am sick of average-looking, nothing-special-about-her AUTHORS writing themselves into their own books in these ridiculously unrealistic scenarios.  (Hello, Twilight and Stephanie Meyer?)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the series and can't wait for another book to come out.I hope it will be soon so i can see what there lifes are up to now  with the kids.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Some of the options sound alike but overall it works fine for me so it was totally worth downloading, especially as a free app. I might even buy the full version!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very informative and it especially reminded us of the rigorous training and readiness of our Seals. Could not put the book down until I completed it. In spite of the odds against them, the Seals and I mean the Seals were successful in their mission against UBL.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The game is much better without the ads. Everything runs smoothly compared to the ad version, and theres no lag like one would see with the ad version.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I bought and loaded the app to my kindle.  The app informed me that it was unable to load on the kindle.<br />I contacted Amazon support, and was advised the it was not compatable with the kindle.  Received credit.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|I would give it 3.5 stars... just for the survival stuff.  I personally think it is a little unbelievable so I found myself saying things like \\"I don't think so\\" and \\"That was dumb\\"... all that aside it was action packed and entertaining... I would watch it again if I didn't have any other options.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I would give it 5 stars, but I am really only getting to judge vicariously through my kids who rarely offered an oppetunity to share in the fun. Was amazing for my 4 year old. The concept is cool.
B001FEAA3C|5.0|Lots of great music on this album! Had the LP back in the day, glad to add this to my current collection.
B0000AFX64|5.0|this is long before the show i believe for the age i thought that it was not bad.  thumbs up if you like original things.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Tempe gets herself in trouble again, as usual.  This book isn't as exciting as some her past but does take you to an interesting locale.  Worth the read.
B007JRUA7K|4.0|Worth watching.  I thought it might be a bit dull and too historical, but it was an interesting story and the movie was well done.
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|jeepers creepers blueray is one scary movie a must have any horrow movie fan it will keep you on the edge of your set this is a 5 star horrow movie if you want to be scared watch this movie late at night.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not much of a story line.  Lots of sex over and over and over and over.  Got boring.  No real point in this story at all.
B00932ANQM|4.0|This movie was perdictable but intertaining.  Typical story line with a happy ending.  Feel good movie.  Great date night movie.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last episode of Hunger Games was lacking in action and overall interest.  It needed more pizazz and a more happy ending.
B008476HBM|1.0|I did not read the book.        I want this  book off my kindle.  I am getting    very  angry.  very angry.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hesitated to buy this book for over 3 weeks because of 1 star reviews on this website. Boy am I glad I finally bought it! I think what may turn some romance readers off is the non vulgarity of language in sex scenes throughout the book. But let me tell you my imagination works just fine and I liked the authors writing style. It was an easy read that had a great flow and I could not put any of these books down!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|great book write another one if someone does not know to much about sex these are the one they need to get
B008D28HYS|4.0|Its addicting but some levels are about impossible. Its free on google play and quite expensive on here.  Well worth playing
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Lets start out by saying there were really cool parts of this movie and then some not so great parts. The storyline was slightly drawn out and a little boring. I didn't like the drawn out huntsman part. He really had nothing to do with the actually story because he lets her flee in the beginning. I wasnt looking for a whole romantic movie, but the prince is the one to wake her up. You shouldn't have messed with that. The action though was awesome! And Charlize Theron is by far one of the best actresses ever! She was gorgeous and just horrible!! Snow White should have been casted to someone else. Stewart isn't that great of an actress plus I find her to be annoying, hence why this isn't one of my favorite moviea. She doesn't really look like a Snow White except she's pale. Lily Collins was so much better in mirror mirror.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I have always been a fan of Mayer since a Room for Squares, with its fun, pop songs like No Such Thing and Your Body is a Wonderland, but I became a dedicated follower after his release of Try!. Try! really pulled Mayer out of the mainstream box and proved how much of a musical genius lies within. Since then we were blown away by Continuum. After what seemed like a long wait, what followed was really lackluster. I did enjoy Battle Studies in a sense, but I still found myself craving more out of it, which it didn't deliver.<br /><br />2012 Mayer followed with Born and Raised. The simplicity and laid-back folk, country, rock sound is fantastic. It once again shows why Mayer wows me with his genius. Queen of California heads up the album and is a wonderful country tune. This easy listen is something to really get you tapping your hands to the beat. Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967 which with its hauntingly beautiful open, makes for a nice folky song. Its deep, its gorgeous, and Mr. Pecorino said it best, this could have been an album of its own...Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey, another personal favorite, I find myself loving the harmonica's melody. I'm greatly surprised and a huge fan of this album. As someone had mentioned, this album doesn't really fall into a mainstream radio playlist easily, not many would understand it. I'd be sad to see this one overlooked since Mayer has once again proven to me that his depth has many layers.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Well worth the price. I love it.  I recommend amazon to all my friends and family because the price is always great for the quality and quantity of music.
B00846REIS|2.0|This author could not have written a single line if she had not read 50 Shades of Grey. Not an original line in the book. She just wrote a nastier version.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really loved this book. Only took me about a day to read, can't wait for the next one to come out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Had trouble getting into first couple of chapters, then ..... couldn't put it down! She scared the crap out of me a couple of times ....
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|For me, it was hard to get into. Read the two previous book, thought they we good. This was not so good.
B001JI8IJW|5.0|I have seen this movie probably 15 times and I NEVER get tired of it.  It's fast-paced, but keeps you on edge as to what's happening just around the corner. It's a nicely laid out \\"puzzle piece\\" movie where everything is dropped into place at the last moment.  You're invested in the characters, laughing at inside jokes, and rooting for the \\"good to win\\".  Plus: Brad Pitt.
B00846REIS|3.0|I have never read a Crossfire Novel before and this will probably be the last.  It is too sexual for my taste.  There is a story line and I will finish the book, but probably won't read another.
B0087HT36U|5.0|kids love it .it needs more, levels added to it .makes the kids think for oncekeep up with  the great games.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was a great continuance of the first book. I loved it. And since it was an e-book I could start reading as soon as I purchased it. No waiting for shipping!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day is a valuable first hand account of one of the most historic events in recent times. It is an easily read book that I found hard to put down. Real life is often better than fiction and this is more than true for the lives of the elite forces. His lead up to the crescendo was great. The self depreciation, reasoning for publishing and somewhat apologetic approach afterwards was less interesting. This book is certainly a piece of modern-day history and I imagine it will inspire young boys, like he was in Alaska, to make the sacrifice and commitment. \\"The only easy day was yesterday.\\" Good job Mark!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my favorite of all the books. They kept getting better as I went. And I loved having it electronically. I could still make notes in it if I wanted and look up words that I didn't know just by selecting and holding the word(s).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I truly didn't check the books contents before reading--just listened to all the hype--now I inderstand that each reader has the right to choose & read what they please--I didn't finish the book--& feel it should have an X rating & not out in stores for just any young person to pick up--it did some humor(what part I read) but found it way too naughty for anyone under the age of consent--
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing. I could not put it down. It had twists that I did not expect. I will be reading this book again.
B007918P1E|5.0|Typical Epica, has the strength and clarity I have come to expect. It has the overall beauty that made me a fan of theem.
0984183523|3.0|The book is poorly constructed, using cheap paper and binding material.  That said, the content is well organized and there are a few chapters that are insightful and useful -- thus it's ok.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|there was some humor but for the most part the chapters got long and boring,I lost interest and quit after the fifth chapter,I would not recomend.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|This classic looks great on blu ray! There is a better special edition of this available now, I believe, but if you want to super cheap version, this is still an awesome buy!
B009AJD5E0|2.0|You have got to be kidding me. Yes, I understand the complexities of CGI and so forth but Jesus Christ.......this movie fails on so many levels. This is absolutely NOT what I expected. It is an abortion of all the Alien series. Sorry your brother was going through difficult times Ridley, but Jesus, maybe it would have been better to step back for a bit. This movie was complete tripe. The dialouge, the casting, the etc. was malignant. The only thing I enjoyed was David and his \\"knowledge\\". I just wish Bishop was there to guide him through this massive hemorrhage. I wouldn't be this harsh on a newcomer, but holy fin christ, you really had to pay the rent didn't you. It was a discombobulated farce of a cinema related excursion.....I half wanted David to morph into Bishop. No...I WHOLLY wanted David to morph into Bishop. Let's see....14.99 could have translated into a cheap steak dinner or food for a month. Thanks for helping me decide.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Some of this movie is good, some of it is hokey, but overall this is still a great film to watch. It looks great on blu ray, but it's light on special features. Especially for a film that's calls itself a \\"collector's edition\\".
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Overwhelming happy that the Kindle has a built-in dictionary. Wish that the chapters started as strongly as they began, but in all, a worthwhile read - not sure I would want to see a movie based on it, but Hollywood has a tendency to rewrite to fit.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Based off the amazing graphic novel of the same name, this movie does a tremendous job of bringing all of the intense action of the story to life. All the characters and acting are over the top, but that's part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch! And it looks amazing on blu ray!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it held my attention to the end. Kudos to Steven, it made me reflect back to that time.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Don't waste your time getting this collection on DVD. It's on blu ray now and I've got to tell you, for the way it looks and sounds, it's worth the extra cost. If for some reason you haven't upgraded, buy this set! It's an incredible collection bristling with special features.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The acting is fairly wooden, but it checks all the boxes for providing blockbuster entertainment in the tradition of Twilight.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|The quality cast combined with a gripping plot will keep you glued to your set every minute of this series.
B007SGM084|3.0|I was an ok book. Definitely did not hold up to all of the hype. It was good enough to read to the end but I did not feel like I could not put it down.
B00514HDNW|3.0|I was'nt as descriptive as I thought it would be.  I had seen the movie first, so I was expecting some real DRAMA?  Never really went into details and how it started/spread?  And I was really disappointed that the dog died...My opinion.  \\"Watch the Movie\\".
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful. Glad I purchased this book. I would recommend this to a friend.  Buying for a kindle is simple and fast.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|As I began reading this story I was looking for something to put me to sleep, instead I found a character that kept me awake. I loved this quirky, comical character, Rose. As I continued to read I found she was from Arkansas, this is my home state. Nobody except Bill & Hillary Clinton are ever mentioned as being from Arkansas. The story was a light mystery full of witty conversation and completely wonderful for escapism to get your mind cleared of other more pressing issues. Loved it! I hope it becomes a series.
0439023521|2.0|The author has a way with the action. Love death traps, and this series has clever death traps and well-executed dramatic moments galore. Unfortunately the characters are terrible. I hate the way the two obvious love interests sacrifice everything to vie for the affections of the heroine whose only admirable qualities seems to be love for her sister and an ability to survive at any cost. About the only time she really shown as anything but a survival automaton was when she shot that arrow in the direction of those dudes -- and she regretted it immediately.<br /><br />These books remind me of the Cube movies, which I totally enjoyed regardless of the low budget and poor acting. But I'd have to say the Cube movies were just generally better conceived than these books that take place in a dysfunctional-to-the-point-of-silly society. A society that is somehow run by a guy who is portrayed as all creepy evil the whole time but is apparently supposed to be multi-dimensional because he claims to mean well at the end? Even when leaders are terrible, they usually mean well. And bad leaders that mean well usually have some kind of either twisted and cocky or overly pragmatic outlook that makes sense from a cold, calculating, cynical perspective. There is nothing about this poverty-ridden yet wasteful society that makes sense from a pragmatic perspective that gives the evil leader dude call to even claim that he meant well(especially after just being totally evil until the last second).
B007ZD17XO|3.0|it freeze all the time....... need to fix it ....then it could be a great game..fix it.. fix it...fix it...
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The book American Sniper is an OK book: OK, but not wonderful. However, it did give some good insight into the personal life of a dedicated military man and the difficulties that being a SEAL causes to attempts at a normal family life.  It has a lot of combat action reporting and filled in info on several battles in Iraq and the reasons behind some of the tactical decisions of the military.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it but some are. impossible but still a good time waster an fun lffklff kkk ok. l llll.  j j k j k. k jk k k k kk
B007MU85D0|4.0|This is a nice album with good music. Its a little hard to follow the lyrics in the beginning because of the strong accent. But once you get the hang of it its awesome.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was a great read. Thanks for sharing the truth and sharing the proceeds with the<br />SEALS' families.  God Bless all our troops.
B001Q2RXJC|5.0|Had this on vynil - so updated to CD and it is still a great album - with extra songs including live concert footage - not sure what heavymetal band you could compare them to
B00122N2D2|1.0|Missing the style of former pieces of glory - Kind of grates on the ear frankly - maybe too much agenda - still love fm just not this album
B00846REIS|2.0|Pretty awful. This was not very well written, the main characters were pretty flat. The sex was mundane, and the language was crude. If you're a 50 Shades fan you'll be sorely disappointed...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best I've ever read! This book will make you laugh out loud and cry with the main character all the way to the end!
B005QVUZIU|4.0|Great instrumental music for long road trips. Missed the dance sequence music from the movie. It was not on the CD. Will keep<br />it my collection for long distance trips.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book kept me reading and wanting more. Not classic literature, but a strong heroine, with realistic conflicts. Great for middle schoolers to adults. Strongly recommended.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Just love Adam Lambert's music, especially the slower songs that really showcase his voice. I always<br />take his CD's with me on road trips. They are perfect driving music, and I play them over and over<br />again. I highly recommend this CD as well as \\"For Your entertainment\\".
B0002ZMIU8|4.0|My sons and I were curious to see if this move held up over the years and we came to the unanimous decision that it's still hilarious! I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. It's a different kind of funny from his normal stuff, just sillier and over the top but if that's your kind of humor I think you'll like this movie.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Typical Jack Reacher - and that's the way we like it.  Read the whole thing in a day and now have to wait for the next one.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Have no idea why the critics hated it.  This was one of the better movies I've seen this year.  Lots of action, and the special effects were great
B005K01VZS|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read! I purchased the e-book for my Kindle, but after reading, I plan to buy the hardback also; one of those to have on the coffee table as a conversation starter. Mitch Albom's style of writing touched my heart. No matter one's beliefs, Reb's goodness and wisdom is a standard we should all strive for.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|I started just to download one song \\"Stronger\\" but after previewing the album I decided to buy the entire album. I love this album. It shows off the talent that comes from a great artist Kelly Clarkson.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It was a little hard at times to keep up with the time line. Still I don't think you could have wrote the book any other way. It read fast and kept my attention. I enjoyed it.
B000N2HCM4|2.0|I found this book to be rather enlightening on how Obama feels about his family history and his country. I recommend people read this to learn the kind of person they have elected to be president of our country, which seems to be a country he doesn't show much love for.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|If you didn't like the \\"re-imagining\\" of Holmes in the first movie, you're going to hate this one too. But if, as I did, you found it an interesting look at what Holmes could have been like if Dr. Watson seriously \\"toned down\\" his narratives...then you're going to like this second installment even more than the first.<br />There is plenty of action, start to finish, but the best aspect of \\"Game of Shadows\\" is the realization that they're giving you all the same clues Holmes is getting, but he's the one who can put them together. I don't want to do any spoilers, but when you see the chain of logic Holmes builds from a book and a plant, you'll appreciate that this movie doesn't treat Holmes merely as an action star, but as a giant of deductive logic who can hold his own when the action starts.<br /><br />I've always viewed Holmes as something of an action-hero anyway...the fight in total darkness in the basement of the bank in The Redheaded League and the physical control required to wait motionless for hours then pounce in The Speckled Band for instance...so these movies haven't put me off as much as some others have indicated. Many of the physical feats of strength and endurance described in the Adventures required not a frail bookworm, but a confident athlete. Give these movies another chance; look at them as not re-imagining Holmes, but expanding on the things Watson put in his narratives.<br /><br />========<br />Editorial comment:<br />I have no idea why Amazon is saying this review is for the instant video version of the movie. I bought the Blu-ray [[ASIN:B007K3JCAE Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows [DVD + Blu-ray + Digital copy]]] and they gave me a short-term rental of the instant video with it. This review is of the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy version.

B008F5FWJ6|5.0|Clifford Curzon has long been a respected pianist, but not exactly household name (to the extent that any Classical performer is a household name in the post-Toscanini era).  During his lifetime and in the decades since his passing, he has been on the second tier of piano fandom - except in Britain.<br /><br />Curzon was a pupil of Artur Schnabel, and the Master's influence is much in evidence: Curzon is very much a Classicist (he died before the HIP movement took root), his adagios are played as such, and he does not embellish the slow movements of Mozart's concertos.  On the other hand, some of his allegros are breathtakingly fast, as in the first set of Schubert Impromptus.  Whatever the tempo, the metric pulse of Curzon's playing is notably more flexible than many latter day exponents of the Germanic school, again this is much like Schnabel.  For those who equate a British exponent of the Germanic school with pedantic, by the book playing, be prepared for moments of surprise, even shock: no pianist has made the two-handed trills of Brahms' First Concerto so terrifying.  Numerous pianists have given us thrilling (or just plain loud) Schubert Wanderer Fantasies.  But how many have bothered playing Liszt's arrangement for piano and orchestra - and even managed to make it sound convincing?<br /><br />By all accounts, Curzon was a somewhat nervous recording artist and rejected numerous takes.  Thus, his recordings from 1937-1972 are covered by only 22 CDs - the 23rd disc is devoted to interviews.  Within those discs is a surprising amount of duplicated repertoire, including four recordings of Mozart's Piano Concerto, K. 488.  (Despite the duplications, Curzon's repertoire is wide ranging, including French and British music Schnabel would have turned up his beak at.)  Curzon's interpretations are remarkably consistent even when the recordings are decades apart.<br /><br />This is not an original album style issue, so most of the CDs are well filled.  There is also a DVD comprised of two television recitals for the BBC.  The sound varies greatly, which is understandable given the various recording locales and dates, but Curzon's lovely tone always comes through.  Decca has done a great service by making all this pianist's recordings with that label available at such a reasonable price.VD comprised of two television recitals for the BBC.

B004SIIBGU|1.0|Very poorly designed app.  Struggle to use.  You have to go through 6 billion steps to refine search. Very slow. Ebay lost my business.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|With the Kindle app for my smart phone, I can read a book while I am waiting.  No longer do I just have to sit there and leaf through old magazines I can read a favorite book.  It is fun and easy.  It even has an automatic dictionary for weird words and the ability to do further research on the internet if necessary. ... It is wonderful.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|The first have of the book was just \\"fill\\", and the second was very good and insightful.  I felt that the first have was difficult to follow and without much to keep one,s interest.
B008I34Y6W|5.0|After the first listen through i hate to admit that this sounds better then the vinyl, its got everything great about the original master but with no chance of wear or dust gathering. This album simply put is one of my all time favorites. There's a size in my heart and this One Size Fits it All. Every single track is nothing short of a superb musical piece of unheard greatness. This re-release is the ultimate release of the album plainly put its just never sounded so good, the RYKO releases don't even hold a candle to this release. Just get it now, ARF....HOY...HOY...HOY.
B004QYZATW|1.0|I refused to watch this when it was at the theatres only because I have the uncanny ability to know when a movie is a dud or not just by watching the trailers. I decided to watch it last night and I was NOT disappointed. I was right again! This movie is so lacking in the WoW department. Depp has no depth, Jolie is plastic. The only thumbs up I give is to Bettany, Dalton and Sewell. This movie did absolutely nothing for either Depp or Jolie. They both must have been bored and needed a project to work on OR someone must have thrown a LOT of money their way to film such tripe.  The writing was ridiculous and SHAME on the shills who post 5 star ratings for this movie. All they are doing is stealing from \\"the people\\" by making us believe (well some of us) that this movie is worth spending your money on. SHAME SHAME SHAME.
B007UXT6T6|3.0|It was just another movie in the series. Don't get me wrong, they did change the format to have a more comedic aspect, but I wasn't wowed. Perhaps I have become desensitized. :)
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw this at the show after I read the book, great just like the book.  I read the other two books after I saw the this movie, and can't wait till the other parts come out.  The author did great in the writing of these books and the I'm sure when the other Hunger Games parts come out they will be great also.  Great for young (not too young) and young at heart.
B0091REZMW|5.0|awesome. game ever except for the diamond and door ls you &ccedil;ant open anything with out diamonds but a very good game and still doesn't look like a free game

B008XG1X18|5.0|this app works perfect on my kindle fire.  easy to navigate and is actually better than the website.  A+++ app!! where have you been all my life?
B00413QB5A|2.0|Not one of Follet's best. It was a departure from his normal story line and being one of his earlier works may have been why it was less than exciting for me to read. Many characters pop in and out of the narrative requiring repeated flip back of pages to refresh my memory and using Kindle made it tougher.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed this triology and can see another book or triology in the making or I at least hope so!<br />Would love to learn more about the relationship from Christain's viewpoint.  This third book wrapped up<br />a lot of loose ends and also added a side story of someone out to crush Christain's perfectly controlled world.<br /><br />If you've already read Books 1 and 2, then this third one is a must!<br /><br />Enjoy :)
B004EPYZUS|4.0|MI 4 or as many people have now dubbed \\"The longest Apple commercial in history\\" is now on dvd and I bought it as soon as I could. I really like all the MI movies, to me Tom Cruise was always much more enjoyable when he was beating the snot out of the baddies. For those fans of the MI trilogy, MI4 will not let you down, it's action packed and a terrific movie. I give it 5 stars all day.
0525953728|5.0|I was engrossed in this book from start to finish.  I know the author was catching a lot of heat in the days leading up to the publication of this book. I really felt that was unfair because someone like this, who has pledged to give his life for our country, if that is what was needed, was at the very least owed the benefit of the doubt by all of us ( in my opinion). And so I just blocked out all the stupid media noise and decided I would read the book, boy am I glad I did.  I am amazed by the preparation, the blood, sweat and the  utter dedication it takes to serve our country.  It is comforting to know that we are represented by the best within the Special Operations community.  And I am so proud to be a citizen of the same country as these guys and I thank my lucky stars that these guys are the ones out on the front lines for us.  I went through this book in 2 days and I got my husband excited about it (and it takes a lot to get him excited about a book I am reading!)  and he can't put  it down.  He went through half the book in  one night which is amazing for him!  I too, think this should be required reading for all of our kids in high school.  We all should be aware of the sacrifices that are made for us and kids should be able to read about real life heroes, see their character and integrity and hopefully be inspired by it.  In case you haven't heard it enough, Mr. Owen, thank you for what you did for this country, we appreciate you and we will never forget.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I just had just finished American Sniper by Chris Kyle, whose prose was better and made his account of his time as a seal much more personable.<br /><br />Thus being said the book gets better as we get closer to the mission, and it does give a feel for their extraordinary contributions and how that felt.<br /><br />It would be great to get the account from the CIA analyst that flew with them, Jen.<br /><br />Also a must read David Gergen's book on the hunt for UBL.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book was awesome. It kept me in suspense from beginning to end. It was never boring not even one page ! If you like mystery with a little bit of science fiction you will love this book.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is soooo addictive.  I need to force myself to put it down just to go to bed.  There are so many puzzles to complete, with new games added on occasion.
B004IQ78HA|5.0|The feelings of nostalgia crept through me as my daughter watch the movie. Seen her excited about Alice and the rabbit brought back feelings of how I enjoyed it when I originally watched it.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|Wonderful read.  Happy with the purchase.  A very good book to come back to and while away the hours on a dismal evening.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I have read the other reviews and I don't disagree, it's not up to the level of the first three books.  That being said, I didn't dislike it. Maybe I'm just not in as much of a hurry to get finished as other readers, but I enjoy the story (even though it moves at a glacial pace).  It's like the lazy river at water parks.  Just sit back and enjoy it.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|As a trekkie its fun to hear the point of view of those who are about to die. Pretty well told story and a great read on the subway when I'm headed to work!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|You will love playing without the adds. It is a more enjoyable playing experience. You can't beat the value, only $.99, enjoy.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Now I'm hooked I only wish I didn't run out of energy so quickly lol! I find myself eagerly awaiting the moment my energy fills so I can play again,  once you start its hard to stop!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was a great somewhat inside look into Seals and their training and missions. I understand the need for secrecy for how they train and what they do so this book doesn't appear to be too specific but on the other hand gives one a sense of what they do. Good job to all the operators out there past, present and future and continue to protect and defend us in the best way you know how!
B002WTOXUK|5.0|This low budget movie packs so much punch for the dollar.  Actually, forget the dollar amount.  If you didn't know it was low budget, one would still enjoy the special effects and true to the best sci-fi, great message about society's incredible ability for intolerance.  It's a fast, powerful punch to our society's history and current viewpoints of intolerance and hate towards different races or species or sexual orientations.
B008N1LL42|4.0|If you liked Transformers you will like Battleship. The movie is very action packed and is well done. The only thing that would have made this a better movie would have been to have it in 3D.<br />It did not do well when it came out and I am not sure why. It is a good movie.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Just seems like recently I keep getting booted out.  It will clock when loading or just randomly while using.  Good app in general, though!
B008MG1E4A|1.0|good info........IT MAKES THE POINT FOR GOVERNMENT TO KEEP ITS MOUTH SHUT.....OBAMA USED THE INFO FOR POLITICAL REASONS..POOR JUDGEMENT ON HIS PART....HE HAS PUT PEOPLE AT RISK, SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES......
0385344333|1.0|I'm sorry, but one of my favorite authors has finally lost it. The plot of this novel is so far fetched, so full of rambling, inconsistencies and loose ends, that I can only surmise that it was written by a ghost writer.<br /><br />I would have given this zero stars, had that option been available. I don't know who wrote it, but it wasn't Lee Child.<br /><br />Seriously, Tom Cruise? I always pictured Reacher as a fortyish Clint Eastwood. Can't think of any actor who could play him right now, certainly not the diminutive Tom Cruise.

Using logic, you must place the colored blocks in the correct order and number (per the clues on the top and sides of the board). If you get everything right, the end product is a picture.

0679746323|5.0|I have read this book again and again and still find new aspects that I didn't contemplate.<br /><br />It makes me so sad when I think about the helplessness of ordinary people when a tyrant like Mao comes to power.<br /><br />Although there are determined critics such as Gregor Benton and Lin Chun who try to paint this monumental work as unbalanced and highly biased, they haven't convinced me.<br /><br />Chang and Halliday have shown me how devious megalomaniacs can successfully pose themselves as sages.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This works fine on my Galaxy Tab, no problems so far.I don't use it often on my tablet, but so far, so good.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Well written and paced, with an appreciation for nature in a harsh environment.  Also works very well from a four-legged point of view.  Great book!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First hand account of the daily perils the magnificent AMERICAN SEALS must deal with.  No fancy writing - just plain, honest words of a great AMERICAN hero.  To merely say \\"thank you for your service and sacrifices\\" is never enough for these great men.  Read the book - you will and must have  greater appreciation of what these heroes endure hourly and daily and perhaps forever.
B008VSKPJO|5.0|Although I normally hate re-releases of albums with bonus tracks, this one is just too good to pass up.  Even if you've got \\"Mayhem\\", the extra tracks here are worth buying individually if that's your thing.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|i'm wondering why numb bears and the sinking man isn't on here :c really really good songs they should've kept when they re-released this. still love this album, i just think they should've kept all of their songs.
B0088TG252|4.0|Nicely done thriller. Action scenes are impressive. The acting is pretty good too.  Blu-Ray extras include \\"how it was made\\" sequences and interviews with the cast, producer, and director.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is excellent! I have not been able to put it down since I purchased it. I'm so excited to read the next book!!!!

B007SSEBCU|5.0|The Iron Lady was an excellent movie.  I was totally imipressed with Meryl's portrayal of her.  The movie gave me an inside look at the Iron Lady's life.<br />I thought the movie was very enjoyable.<br /><br />Ellen
B00123KEX2|5.0|Amazing album from start to (especially) finish. On a record that opens with a one two punch of \\"And the Cradle Will Rock...\\" and \\"Everybody Wants Some!!\\", its the closing three that are the overlooked gems. \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\", \\"Could This Be Magic?\\", and \\" In a Simple Rhyme\\" steal the show. If you're even a casual VH fan you need this album.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was a series that was a page turner.  I could not put my Kindle down. LOVED THE ENTIRE SET Kuddos to  Suzenne Collins.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It was a very good book very descriptive to the end and I felt as if I was on the mission with the Seals every step of the way. From the training till the actual mission of killing Osama Bin Laden.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's fantastic that I am able to access Pinterest from my Kindle. Now I have more ways to feed my addiction.
B004KPQK2S|4.0|Great movie!  It has emotional importance without being over the top or vulgar.  I let me 4 year old watch the movie and she loved it!
B007FU1OH6|3.0|Having read \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" which I thought was worth 5 stars, I was filled with trepidation that Zafon could do such a great job a second time.<br />It was not as good as there was not the thriller element that was so enthralling in the first book.  However, the characters are wonderful & the humour is superb.  Friends of mine have read it as a stand alone book & really enjoyed it but felt they were a bit confused at times.  I never felt that but then the memories of \\"Shadow...\\" were fresh.<br />Zafon is a master.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I am having trouble getting through the attic door.  I appear to be stuck in the beginning of the game and cannot go anywhere. This is the first game I have ever had that trouble with. I need to figure it out some more I guess but some tips would be a good addition.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Definitly an overhyped book. Doesn`t give any new information on the raid or anything else. Many much better books on Special Forces Operations out there
0143038419|1.0|Gilbert is soincredibly narcissistic I could not finish this book.  A spoiled liberal new Yorker, she isn't happy (cry me a river), so she goes on a journey to 'find' herself.  As long as one is chasing happiness, they will never find it.  I have pity on this woman....she is so self-centered that she has literally become self-destructive.  Don't waste your time reading this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is awesome. Truly entertaining in a lot of different ways. Turns what you think would be an common, redundant game type in to a unique and hilarious experience from the title screen onward. I am addicted.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Was a very enjoyable movie, the storyline and the photography were awesome.  I have watched the movie a few times since purchasing it and enjoy it more each time.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Awsome band awsome music this is worth the money if you know a slipknot fan a must have album for them
B008476HBM|5.0|Very well written British literature. Example of the life and times during this period, giving an insight of day to day living
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator did exactly what I wanted for my kindle.  Calculate figures quickly.  Perfect for on the go balancing of my checkbook.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|I have always loved this movie and was excited to watch it again... Plus its a great watch for the kids while on long trips. :)
B008D28HYS|5.0|This colored Cross Me app is just as challenging as the black and white Cross Me.  The more you do, the more challenging they are.  I am hooked on the Cross Me apps.  The designs sometimes are so unexpected, but they are amazing once you complete them.  I do at least one or more in the evening before bed.  Too much fun.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|can't say enough I'm wordless it' a resounding review there aren't enough words to say what can never be said at the least it is a silent tribute
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I liked this book for the story, but the characters could use some additional details and depth. Perhaps the sequals will bring more dimension to the important characters and help us understand their motivations.
