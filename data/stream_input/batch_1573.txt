B007L3BMGA|1.0|Don't bother reading this book, it does not live up to the hype, the author is boring and irritating with her repeated use of the phrase \\"Oh my\\" I wanted to throw this book in the bin after three chapters but persisted in the vain hope that it would improve. I now feel cheated at the time I wasted reading this drivel. It's like a sixteen year old wrote it. I wish I could get my money back!

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very thrilling and it even makes me angry when I lose because I want to keep playing! I play it every single day.
B004M5HUXE|4.0|When I first read this book 50 years ago, I thought it was about sex.  Upon rereading, I find it is about the status of women, social class, and industrialization. I guess those topics are sometimes about sex, but in a different way.  Anyway, I find D.H. Lawrence always entertaining.
B0084LQHN6|5.0|Banks song '212' will go down as a hip hop classic. Very few in the rap game today can stand up against her talent and originality. The '212' is already one of the best rap videos ever.
B005KXTER2|4.0|I bought this CD for my wife who is a big Genesis fan. This was the first of Steve's solo projects that we have checked out. While this album did not blow our minds there is some good stuff on it.
B007NZ7LIY|5.0|Every but as good as the original if not better. Hoping for a port of the sequel, Flash back soon
B006CS7UXO|5.0|Although I try to get the limited edition 2 CD version of each PSB CD, there were many songs on this collection that I did not own, many on the CD singles that I don't always buy.  This does complement all of the regular CD's well, and is an important addition to your collection if you are a big PSB fan.  Not for the people that still think PSB is a one hit wonder.
B00633W614|5.0|I picked up the first book in the Clifton Chronicles and couldn't wait to purchase the next installment, \\"Sins of the Father\\".  I literally couldn't put it down!  Sir Jeffrey, I hope the next installment rolls off your pen (or laptop) quickly.  We are all hanging on cliff waiting to see what unfolds next!!!!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This case works great with our Kindle Fire.  We didn't have the wrinkling or smell problem that others have had.  Would definitely purchase it again.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|ST:Invasion is a surprisingly good and entertaining sequel to Verhoeven's classic.  Just try and blot out the two middle sequels from your mind before you watch.<br /><br />All the old characters are back; Rico, Carmen, and Carl, albeit in CG form.  The Mobile Infantry troopers finally have individual powered armor in addition to their Marauder units from the last ST iteration.  Invasion is like a much better version of the Roughnecks: ST Chronicles.<br /><br />Although this is an animated movie, it still has all the gore and nudity of the original.  There is also harsh language.<br /><br />This promising release has raised my hopes that the upcoming remake of Starship Troopers will be well-handled.
B001LM1456|1.0|This movie is just awful.  The perplexing thing is why when Edward Norton transforms into the hulk, the hulk looks like an angry green Ashton Kutcher.  This just breaks my suspension of disbelief.  And for the sheer amount of money spent on exotic locations like a favela in Brazil, the studio had to fake New York City with a location that sort of pretends to be Harlem but isn't.  Why is that?  But I think the biggest failing of the film is Liv Tyler's character who is some kind of great scientist who spends the entire movie peeping and chirping like a star struck submissive teenager.  For a kid who grew up around an aggressive father like the General, she sure isn't assertive in any way that's useful.  The stronger acting performances from Edward Norton and Tim Roth is demolished by the fact that they never talk to each other. And a lot of the dialog between Norton and Tyler are throwaway nonsense.  And what's the deal with the university scientist with no qualms of human experimentation? (\\"all the experiments have failed...\\") It's basically a symptom of bad writers who fail to ground themselves in reality and use special effects as a crutch.  We shove off to faraway locations like Brazil and Guatemala and then fake up the locales that are most familiar to Americans and then write up the worst scientist characters ever.  Ugh.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much it keeps my nephews busy when I'm busy they love it too five stars
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you think this is a wife missing, husband suspect, ordinary kind of book, it is not!  It kept me guessing the whole way through!  I got way too involved with the characters and stayed up to finish, and then couldn't go to sleep thinking about all that happened!!
B0036S4CTS|5.0|My name is Larry Hoffer and I am an absolute sap. Seriously. I get teary-eyed when people win sports championships or awards; even some songs and television commercials make me cry. And so while it shouldn't come as a complete surprise to me, David Nicholls' terrific book, One Day made me sob. I mean, I came completely unhinged. Egads.<br /><br />Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew connect at a party the night they graduate from college in Edinburgh. Dexter is good-looking, popular and privileged, fairly unaware of the world around him except where it directly affects him; Emma, of middle class origins, considers herself to be a bit non-conformist, although she has had a bit of a crush on Dexter throughout college. They nearly sleep together, but spend about a day and a half in each other's company. And this sets in motion a connection that spans nearly 20 years. One Day follows the peaks and valleys of Dexter and Emma's relationship on the same day--July 15--each year. Sometimes they're close friends; sometimes they're not. Sometimes one is romantically involved while the other isn't. Sometimes one experiences career success while the other struggles. One of the characters refers to Emma and Dexter as \\"Harry and Sally,\\" and there is definitely elements of that film relationship in theirs. But the book is funny, thought-provoking, emotionally charged and even a little maudlin from time to time, especially if you're a sap.<br /><br />This is a book about love, in many forms--friendship, romance, sexual attraction, marriage, parent/child relationships, unrequited crushes, etc. As Emma says at one point, \\"Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance.\\" The book may be a bit predictable at times, and sometimes the characters aren't completely likeable, but I found this tremendously compelling and gripping. It has been optioned into a movie, and as much as I hate most film adaptations of books I love, I will definitely need to see this one, because much as its main charactersfelt about each other, this book has gotten hold of my heart. If you're a romantic--or just a sap like me--read this book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a fun game to play and its free. I like it a lot except for how it wants you to pay for more money.
B000ID1J5E|4.0|excellent movie with great acting. there are some holes in why what the husbands does in the end works, but not a big issue.

0439023513|5.0|Even though there is no real way to end the hunger games trilogy, it did put some closure to the story.<br /><br />Seller A+, book arrived quickly and in excellent condition.. excellent reliable seller
0345803507|1.0|I usually do not read Romance Novels. With the trilogy being recommended by the NY Times best selling list and with scores of people online who were just gushing over the novel, I broke down and decided to buy the book @ Amazon for $9,97 + $3.00 for s&h for around $13+ $.<br /><br />I was so upset to realize (I bought the first two of the trilogy, spending around $26.00+) that I completely wasted good money on absolute trash. First of all, I thought E L James was not a good writer as everyone claimed her to be. I was so disappointed. I wanted to throw the book at the wall, but since I paid good money, I suffered through the first two books and NO, I will not purchase the 3rd book.<br />There were so many inconsistencies that it drove me crazy. And her writing stlye...Ana, the heroine always saying: Crap, Jeez, all the time was so childish and she's supposed to be a college grad. Oh and don't let me start on her inner goddess always talking back at her. She vacillates continuously throughout both books.<br /><br />Christian is so perfect. At 27 he is a CEO of his own company, with boats, glider helicopter, cars, homes, vacation homes, etc., he is so extremely rich, powerful and so handsome that everyone in the book falls so in love with him. The only dark side is his predilection for S&M lifestyle and his past. But, my God how perfect they both appear which is obviously not in the real world.<br /><br />To me this is a waste of time and not a good book at all.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of the best books of its type I have read.  Big book, well written packed with intrigue, suspense action fellowship and romance. This price i a steal.  This guy is the goods.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I can remember when you spend 100 bucks on a separate machine that just made wave sounds. This app has the most sounds for the money. Many apps do just one sound, like just rain. I'll take one star away for no alarm abilities, like mentioned in the website.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this first book, it was entertaining and kept me wanting to read on!!!! I had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait to read the next two and will be ordering them right away!
B007PVHANM|5.0|Being a massive Bob fan, it shouldn't have taken me this long to see this documentary, but in my defense I really was not expecting any new facts, performance footage or interviews to be revealed.  After viewing, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised at what additonal footage they were able to get that wasn't already in other Bob documentaries.<br /><br />Interviews with unknown (to me) family members were very interesting.  I loved it when his half-sister was asked to listen to Cornerstone and how she immediately interpreted it's meaning.  I was surprised though that only Ziggy and Cedella were interviewed from all his children.  Nice new interviews though with Bunny and his obvious delight to talk about early Wailers.<br /><br />As far as performance clips, most I have seen before.  Maybe a couple of live clips that I haven't or possibly forgotten about.  But no matter how many times I see it, the One Love concert clip where Bob is just going crazy with the dancing is amazing!<br /><br />The sad ending is very emotional.  I hadn't seen some of the photos from the clinic in Germany.  This is a man though whose legacy will continue to live on and thanks to this documentary insofar as it's part to help maintain that.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|All the Mahjong games so far have been absolutely awesome and addictive that I have played so far. I can't wait to learn and play a lot more games. Being a senior I am not as quick at these games as the younger kids are, so it takes me longer to play and concur games today, but I am doing it, look out angry birds here I come!!!!!
B004XKVPG6|1.0|Se7en is a solid 5 star movie.  But watch out.  There's a Canadian version which is the wrong aspect ratio, 1080i  (not 1080p), and contains no bonus features.  The newer one (with a red and black cover) is the one you want, NOT the version with the 2 actors on the cover. These 2 versions are getting mixed together somehow, as I've tried to order the \\"correct\\" copy TWICE but was sent the wrong one each time.  Don't order if the supplier is a Canadian dealer!
B004QSQMKE|2.0|I prefer the theatrical version much better (opening and ending).  I thought the images of the feast luring Mia was not visually seen well on the directors cut as well as other scenes.  I was very disappointed when I did not see the elf place the unicorns horn back on it's head.  I also prefer the musical score by Tangerine.  I will now have to buy the theatrical version because I do not like the director's cut version which I mistakenly purchased.<br /><br />Marie
B00371V6SE|5.0|I bought it so that I could read it before I watch the movie. I loved it!I couldn't stop reading.So nicely structured and the story is great!Nicholas Spark is a great writer!
1609611543|5.0|It's an eye-opener.  For the past 3 weeks, I have changed my diet to avoid whole wheat products.  It's been a challenge since everything we eat in our home is whole wheat including spaghetti, bread, cereals, sandwiches, pasta dishes.  I'm going Gluten free & have found different stores that carry a lot of those items.  I see a lot of Chex cereals are made with rice which is great for my family.  I'm going to the doctor for my regular blood tests which I do every 3 months & am anxious to see if there has been a difference.  This book is my Bible in this new field.  I do feel better but I haven't lost much of any weight since I'm eating a lot of fruits & vegetables.  I am exercising but I think in the long run, I will lose pounds if I continue to do this diet.  I do believe I'm losing weight on my fat belly which I haven't been able to do no matter how much exercise I did in the past.  This book has been a God-send for me - thank you!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I tried to play this game on my Droid Razor Maxx but when I tapped a puzzle piece to move it from the edge to the center, I opened an ad.  I never did get to play the game because of all the ads.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|This is a real jewel and lucky find. Recently mentioned by critic John Van Rhein in a Chicago Tribune column. Contains many of the classics I was introduced to early in my youth and by the same performers. Sound quality is superb as Mercury was always known for at that time. Highly recommended to any who are into classical music. Nice boxed set, good documentation, great sound, and an extraordinary price for the 51 CDs - $2.00 each.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really awesome. I love playing it and I can't wait to see how far I can run.  the only thing I caution you on is to not let little kids who can't read play this.  my five year old cousinn almost bought a package of coins for real money!  also: thank you amazon for putting this in the app store for kindle fire!!!!!
B007J2TMQ0|2.0|This book presents a very superficial picture of WW2, excluding an analysis of the reasons why the war happened. It is understandable that the writing many times are partial but the many references to some unknown German low rank military are tiresome and seems to be shear gossip.
B008AZWMMG|5.0|I picked up this album at Dirtfest this past weekend. I have listened to it nonstop since then. Simply Amazing!!
B008ASLK8A|2.0|Normally I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes.  I saw the first movie with Robert Downey, Jr. and enjoyed it enough to watch the second movie.  However, this just did not hold my interest and I never finished watching it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|how this is so popular is beyond me.  there must be a lot of sheltered people out there.  personally, my inner goddess was throwing up.  christian went from a strong male character to a sniveling toddler.  ick.  shouldn't have wasted my time.

B001HBYHFA|5.0|This made me a fanboy.  It's a little disturbing to like a show so much....  It will get you too.
055357342X|5.0|The third book starts off with a word of understanding from Martin regarding the sequence of events in the book, There are so many different sub-stories happenings that it is necessary to \\"go back in time\\" to address what a particular character(s) were doing. The twists and turns in the book are extremely satisfying and will keep you hooked. There are so many \\"cliff-hangers\\" that you will be craving to read Book 4.<br /><br />It is the longest book so far and be can be daunting to read but the way Martin structures the plot will help you stay focused. The ending will satisfy any SOIAF fan.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't see what all the fuss is about. The book is ok, the story line is plausible, and you get pulled in enough to care about the characters. But I didn't find it as overly sexy as the media is hyping it to be. If you want crazy sexuality try the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy by Anne Rice, or the Princess Merry and Anita Blake series' by Laurell K Hamilton.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this app but the crystals are so hard to get. But besides that I love growing my magical plants.
0307719774|3.0|I wish I would have known how terribly small the book is. :( It is a great concept but almost impossible to write in...does not lay flat and it is super small. Kind of disappointed. Would have LOVED it if it had been on a ring binder or even just bigger....trying to figure out a way to re-design it for myself!!
B0027BVMSY|5.0|I'm not going to analyze the movie piece by piece. Everybody know the Bond movies are a great spectacle. This one is no different. It was a treat to witness the events that make Bond who he is today. Watching him turn from a smug, cocky super spy to a real person with pinned emotions bent on revenge is awesome. Plus this young Bond is more 'hands on' and physical than the Bond I'm used to. I couldn't wait until he caught up with his girl's killers. Love the toys, hot car chases, & shoot outs. Enjoy the movie!
0062124293|5.0|As a middle-aged man, I'm not exactly Moran's core demographic. I picked this up on a whim at Heathrow airport last year. And it was the best book I read all year. Riotous, irreverent, compassionate, and thoughtful. She writes with such an inhabited voice. I hope it's taught in 100s of gender studies classes-men really need to read this as well. A lot of them will love it. So much feminist writing, like so much academic writing in general, is a bit sludgy. Fortunately, Caitlin Moran's voice, humor, and perspective haven't been sullied by academe. She gives me new hope for the reach and power of her generation's feminism.
038551123X|3.0|its so hard to give friends books like these, you want to describe the sickness and awesomeness of these books but you cant! and you want your friends to enjoy it so badly! the dexter from the books is much different than the tv show dexter. The books convey dexters dark passenger almost as a dark-psychic-creature. Very interesting, more so than the show.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I've tried the movie first, and I wanted to try the book.<br />The images of the characters remained, so it is easier to adapt those imagese to the book. Plot itself is twisting and entertaining!
B000FC12YQ|5.0|OH...MY...GOD. That is probably what you're going to say after having read this book. It is, in my opinion, one the best Hercule Poirot novels. The narration, the characters, the plot, and all the other elements of the story are just amazing. A must read if you're a fan of mystery novels.
B004SIP8QQ|5.0|Fantastic film. A must own for anyone who loves Tarantino. It is, in my opinion, even better than the first Kill Bill. It's a marvel of storytelling that is rarely equaled.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books! Everyone was talking about the first one and due to all the good reviews out there I decided to buy all three. You must buy all three, even though they are a bit long, its a page turner and goes by fast. Glad I bought all of them because as soon as I was done reading one, I had the next one in my back pocket! Great story line over all, and they get \\"milder\\" from 1 to 3 book.
B0000YEEGM|4.0|This was not my personal favorite, but it is a good film. I've seen better performances by both Hoffman and Cruise, and the direction felt a little slow and sloppy at times, but you have to credit it overall. It's a touching, human story that could have been told a little better.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|For those into BDSM, this book is dumb! We dont want two kids running around in the end and a master who forfits being a master seriously WTF. I took the books back to to used book store got a credit and bought the secretary on dvd. AND omg to much drama!!!!!!
1400069289|5.0|Charles Duhigg's study of human habit is deep and fascinating. Outside of logic and processing, humans are subject to what Duhigg describes as The Habit Loop...\\"This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which behavior to use. The there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is the reward . . .\\" There is obviously a very natural connection to marketing in this book, but it is also great for any executive to understand the response of human behavior.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|The history of Rock music was changed forever by the release of the Beatles<br />Sgt. Pepper's album. Before it's debut, rock albums were just a bunch of songs<br />put together on a record. But The Beatles showed how you could create an album. This album showed that rock music was indeed an art form. By creating a concept and blending in music with it, rock music was led into a new direction that would never be turned back again. There is no doubt whatsoever that this is the most important album ever made. Ironically enough though I don't think this is the best album The Beatles ever made. Rubber Soul, Revolver or even Abbey Road are probably their best albums. But none of those albums made music history the way Sgt. Pepper did.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run and its awesome and can I please get the app and please I love the game and I alwayswanted to play the game so its awesome to play and I hope I love it and its cool and I hope its fun
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Like some of the others here with 3, 2, or 1-star reviews, I know I'm going to get attacked, but I didn't think this was a GREAT movie.  This wasn't even the best comic book movie, and it wasn't the best superhero movie.  The movie Thor had an excellent storyline, but here, Thor was kind of bland, even having a few plot holes that I found rather annoying.<br />Surprisingly, I found Black Widow to be one of my favorite characters, but alas, just like characters such as Nick Fury and Hawkeye, there was barely any depth or character development for her.<br />I found Hawkeye to be really cool in his one minute in Thor and was looking forward to learning more about him.  What did I learn?  He's a SHIELD agent with a cool bow and set of arrows and...actually, I think that's it.<br />This movie had absolutely no tension whatsoever, and yet, the writers still tried to push for tension that didn't work in the least.  Thanks for telling us there'll be an Iron Man 3 long before this film hit the theaters!<br />I loved Loki in Thor.  He was deceitful, and he always had a back-up plan.  Here, he's not even his own boss.  He's helping an alien race that we don't get ANY details on, and there are no surprises from him at all.  Actually, he made a complete fool of himself at times.<br />I agree that a lot of people are so captivated by the show-offy special effects in action films these days that they never think about the plot or character development.  Personally, I was not blown away for the most part.  If you want to see REAL fight scenes but there is still an excellent story surrounding that, watch Red vs Blue.<br />Which then brings me to the character development.  There's a little bit for Tony Stark (Iron Man) here, but nobody else gets any character development.  Disappointing as well.  Again, I've seen better in action-packed stuff.<br />I've been pretty negative, so I'll say that I WAS entertained, even if the first half of the movie was boring.  The fight scenes are atleast fun to watch, its got some great humor, and it's probably my second favorite superhero movie just for being fun.
B0037YOMWS|3.0|The calculator is one of the cheapest with RPN mode and I bought it for quick and dirty financial calculations mostly concerned with investments but also when verifying some bookkeeping.<br /><br />I like RPN for scientific calculations (have HP 50g and 35s and iPhone apps) so figured this was good.<br /><br />The algebraic mode feel pretty crappy compared to an entry level casio (fx-82).<br />Chain mode might make sense for someone not into math.<br /><br />Programming and assignment to keys, and 10 memories are good. Really easy to use and learn.<br />It also has some probabilistic functions and trigonometric functions.<br /><br />The looks: i thought it was steel, but photos lie. It's plastic with metal look, and the sides are high, protecting keys/display when upside down. The plastic is hard and protects display. viewing angle not great but works i guess. keys are ok again, not the best. I like both casio fx-82 and hp 35s more. The thing is pretty small and light weight!<br /><br />Will probably not use this very much, but will keep it on my desk for when i need to fiddle with numbers. Using financial functions is much easier than on HP 50g.<br />For the price I payed, $15, I think it's good enough!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read all three books and they are great.  Kept you reading and wanting to know what was next.  Book three started out a little slow, but ended up a great read.  Loved the series!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I do not usually write reviews for anything but a couple chapters into this book I knew it was going to be one of my favorites and I would have to share it with the Amazon world! First off, I enjoyed the writer's humor and sarcasm. The two main characters, Nick and Amy, are very real and easy to relate to. I enjoyed how the book goes back and forth between Amy's journal entries and Nick's present day. For me, the best experience about the book were the sudden twists you absolutely will not see coming. You never have an obvious good guy and bad guy, as both characters you will learn to love and hate. This story, at it's core, is a real look into the complicated and multi-faceted nature of marriage. The only reason I did not give this book a rating of five was because I felt the ending was a bit anti-climactic. Still, an amazing read. I can't wait to read the author's two other books!

B005LAIISU|5.0|In this new installment, we find our favorite main characters from the<br />previous films (Ray Romano,\\" Everybody Loves Raymond\\"; Denis Leary,<br />\\"Rescue Me\\"; John Leguizamo, \\"Carlito's Way\\") on board for another<br />exciting, fun-filled adventure. What I really liked about Ice Age 4:<br />Continental Drift is the repeated theme of family and loving one<br />another no matter what, which is a great message for all ages and the<br />movie delivers it without being preachy. And even though it's not as funny as<br />the previous three movies (due to there being more dramatic elements,<br />which made me feel for the characters more), there are still plenty<br />laughs to be had.<br /><br />Now for the (very minor) flaws:<br /><br />1.> The teenage mammoth characters (voiced by rap/R&B singers Drake and<br />Nicki Minaj and \\"Glee's\\" Heather Morris) are completely annoying and<br />useless, and they drag the movie down a bit.<br /><br />2.> The relationship/romance between Diego (Leary) and Shira<br />(singer/actress/\\"American Idol\\" judge Jennifer Lopez) didn't get much<br />screen time or development.<br /><br />3.> The scenes with Scrat weren't as funny this time around, probably<br />because he's been overused, but he does get less screen time compared<br />to the first two movies.<br /><br />4.> Overall the movie tried to cram too much into too little time.<br /><br />Overall Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is a really good movie, you won't<br />regret seeing it.<br /><br />Now please bring on Ice Age 5!!!!!!

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is perfect non-obtrusive protection for the Kindle Fire! You hardly know it's there... If you're looking for leather and pizzaz, look at another cover. No bulk, no muss, no fuss. As for the 'will it stand or won't it' commentary, I've had no problem getting it to stand up when asked...
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a great book and I had a hard time putting it down!  It was great to purchase the trilogy as I was able to move on to the next book without having to wait on the rest!
B000002JPA|5.0|Recovering from losing their previous frontman, Charlie Dominici, Dream Theater have decided to step it up a notch with new vocalist James LaBrie, who fits the band like a glove. \\"Images and Words\\" turns out to be one of Dream Theater's strongest efforts, and definitely helped bring progressive metal out as a whole to the mainstream.<br /><br />1. Pull Me Under - Fantastic for an opening track. This song turned out to be a major sleeper hit. The song is moderately paced, starting off with a clean guitar intro slowly accompanied by more instruments such as keyboard, bass, and drums. The intro continously builds up into whats turns out to be the majority of the song; heavy, distorted guitar with strong keyboard leads and soaring vocals. For a popular single, 8+ minutes is usually unheard of, but this song really has a lot going for it. The strong keyboards, guitar, and lyrics make this song stand out.  4/5<br /><br />2. Another Day - A ballad, and what was predicted to be the album's lead single, as it certainly had potential. Although it attracted some attention, it never reached the status of \\"Pull Me Under\\". This is definitely one of the softer songs on the album, dominated mainly by clean guitar and piano with occasional saxophone. John Petrucci's guitar work, Jay Beckenstein's contribution on the saxophone, and LaBrie's vocals are this song's strong points. Dream Theater really does know when to tone it down, as the band doesn't make the song sound virtuosic. It's lyrics are sincere, and LaBrie's approach on the song really does it justice, making this ballad feel heartfelt and genuine, instead of trite and pretentious. 4/5<br /><br />3. Take the Time - Definitely one of the album's heaviest songs. Sporadic time signatures and rapid notation dominate this song. Petrucci really changes it up on this song, with plenty of clean guitar as well as distortion, accompanied by harmonics, complicated chords, and even a dive bomb or two. John Myung and Mike Portnoy are just as amazing, with a constant barrage on bass guitar and drums, respectively. Kevin Moore definitely gives an interesting take on keyboards, with the occasional solo but mainly changing the sound of his instrument for many different background accompaniments. Voice samples are used in the song, and tend to be used a bit on this album and others by Dream Theater, although they fit perfectly virtually every time they are used, especially on this song. 5/5<br /><br />4. Surrounded - A bit of a slow start, but builds up into a very majestic song, with beautiful lyrics, surreal keyboard work, and a great guitar solo. It isn't the most technical song, nor one of the longer ones on the album, but it makes up for it being an interesting quasi-ballad. 4/5<br /><br />5. Metropolis, Pt 1.: The Miracle and the Sleeper - One of the longest and most technical songs on the album, \\"Metropolis\\" definitely shows what the band is capable of in terms of technical prowess and has some of the best lyrics of the band to date. It start's off with lots of keyboard work, with guitar, drums, and bass slowly crawling into the song as it turns into a ferociously heavy break leading into a strong but more moderate verse. The song goes back and forth between heavy and soft which prevents it from being repetitious. Later, the song goes into a long instrumental section that is extremely varied, showcasing the instrumental abilities of the band, as well as their sense of melody. 5/5<br /><br />6. Under a Glass Moon - One of the album's heavier offerings. It starts off a bit barren, but rapidly picks up in terms of aggressiveness. The phrasing seems to be more like a standard song, such as \\"Pull Me Under\\", but, as with most Dream Theater songs, it inevitably veers off on it's own with instrumental sections and an incredible guitar solo. 4.5/5<br /><br />7. Wait for Sleep - A short but sweet ballad. Mainly driven by piano and vocals, it's a vastly different than anything else on the album, offering achange of pace and a nife refrain from the progressive metal sound dominant on this album. 4/5<br /><br />8. Learning to Live - The epic closing song. The lyrics, written by Myung, are borderline free-verse, which certainly fits with the band's progressive style of rapidly changing time signatures and atmosphere. This song borrows elements (and even a riff) from previous songs on the album; the heaviness, the progressive-ness, melody, technical prowess, and extended length. The instrumental breakdown on this song is different than the ones before it, with solos focusing more on sound and melody than sheer skill. Moore, Peturcci, and LaBrie are definitely the stars of this song, demonstrating not only their talent at technicality but how varied they are and how well they suit the band and this song with outstanding performances. 5/5<br /><br />This album shows the best of Dream Theater's traits; their heaviness, technical prowess, and sense of melody. It is seen by many as Dream Theater's best album, and even one of the best progressive metal albums of all time. It is, without a doubt, one of their best albums to date. Even with age, this album stands on it's own well enough without a reputation as a Dream Theater album that was \\"too heavy\\" or \\"too progressive\\". It has all the elements that Dream Theater has showcased without ever overstepping any boundaries.change of pace and a nife refrain from the progressive metal sound dominant on this album. 4/5<br /><br />8.

0307341550|3.0|Dark and disturbing...check<br />Every clich&eacute;d psychological disorder in the DSM IV...check<br />Freak show type characters...check<br />Mean girls on steroids...check<br /><br />Not bad for a first novel. I haven't read horror since Stephen King's heyday and this is pretty much it, with bizarre violence and animal scenes with a teen girl...shock value perhaps? The reader is supposed to see how disturbed and eff'ed up the main character is due to every reachable surface of her skin being slowly and methodically rearranged by self infliction with Sharp Objects. The self cutting seems so clich&eacute;d to me, I am no longer a teenage girl, and neither is the main character. Psychologically disturbed adults find other ways to be self destructive like alcohol, drugs, and sex. Those addictions are involved in the book too, but cutting? Really? It's time to grow up and stop hating yourself.<br /><br />After I got over my annoyance that the main character is really supposed to be a mature, responsible, working adult and not a teenage goth princess, I found the suspense to be pretty good. It kept me guessing, I found the younger sister to be a more developed character and I was more concerned for her than the main character, but that didn't make the story any less engaging.<br /><br />Sharp Objects is a good quick read, the closer to the end of the mystery, the better the story was. I've read all of Gillian Flynn's books and they keep getting better, it's nice to see a writer develop so well.
0143038095|5.0|I saw the movie almost 20 years ago and now my daughter wants to read the book so I got it for her. The characters are amazing and Miss Tan is a gifted story teller. you won't regret it.
0307477479|1.0|So. I did not enjoy this mess of a novel. It lacked cohesion, the first chapter made no sense and I had to keep flipping back and forth to keep all the characters straight. I love a complicated story, but it has to flow. Goon Squad didn't. As a writer, I see what Jennifer Egan was trying to do, but I don't think it worked, at least it didn't work for me. It was a good effort on POV writing but the execution was sloppy.<br /><br />Original story...yes. Once you could figure out what the hell was happening and who was talking, the story could be interesting. But I don't want to read a research paper disguised as a novel.<br /><br />That said, there are other works by Jennifer Egan that are fantastic, like Invisible Circus and the The Keep. Goon Squad just didn't do it for me.
055358202X|4.0|I'll try and keep my intro quick, and say that while I understand where the majority of reviewers are coming from, I still found A Feast for Crows to be an overwhelmingly worthy read--a complex and compelling continuation of a series that most can probably agree will go down in history as one of the greatest examples of high fantasy since The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />What follows is a list of responses to the 5 most common complaints I've heard on AFFC. I'm not attempting to invalidate legitimate concerns here (you'll find that I agree with some of them, which is why AFFC only gets 4 stars in my book), but I'd like to provide alternate interpretations so that people will not find themselves scared off by the startlingly negative reviews of this novel.<br /><br />1) QUIT TALKING AND START FIGHTING ALREADY<br /><br />No one can deny that AFFC does not display combat or, for that matter, action of any kind on the scale of the previous three novels. The title itself should cue you in pretty quick: War on a grand and glorious scale is over (for now), and the crows are swooping in for their pickings. This might present a significant problem for you if you were reading this series purely for the masculine displays of brute strength, the riveting battle sequences, the thrill and fear of a nation in the midst of a shattering war. (My fellow Lord of the Rings fans may understand this as \\"The Helm's Deep Appeal.\\") But if you are a true fan, this most likely is not the case: You weren't reading just for blood and gore. You were reading to further immerse yourself in this incredibly real world that Martin has created. And the battles, by the way, have certainly not ceased to exist. They've become less about trumpet-sounding and more about sneaking around in the dark with a knife, but the action is still there, as are its inevitable consequences. Just ask Brienne. Or Ser Arys Oakheart.<br /><br />The fact that interior dialogue has become more rampant is also impossible to dispute. I guess some people might find it boring, but others, like myself, will certainly enjoy the more intimate connection with the characters and the in-depth look at what motivates them and drives them into madness on a daily basis. Speaking of which...<br /><br />2) WE'RE NOT CERSEI LANNISTER'S THERAPIST<br /><br />Yes: Cersei Lannister has issues which you are forced to hear about on a regular basis, but these are not the problems of a hormonal teenage girl in love with a certain vampire...*cough cough*. Cersei's issues are gritty and real: A kingdom to run, a naïve boy king to manage, traitors to seek out, a terrifying prophecy to combat. Her paranoid ramblings are there, but so are the themes of betrayal and political intrigue that have woven together the plots of the previous novels. In fact, in Cersei's sections, I see a return to \\"the old way\\" that many readers have accused Martin of abandoning in AFFC.<br /><br />Some people have argued that what makes the Cersei chapters so irritating isn't their content as much as the time spent on them; we hear from her more than any other character in the book, prompting some to suggest that Martin could have portrayed her descent into paranoia in fewer pages. Perhaps he could have...but perhaps not. After all, leading someone down the path to mental breakdown isn't something that happens in a few dozen pages, especially not when the character in question was previously portrayed as unbreakable. Martin had to cripple Cersei gradually, or else it would have been impossible to believe, and personally, I rather enjoyed the slow slide toward the inevitable disaster you simply knew was lurking at the end, though you weren't quite sure how it was going to happen. (As a side note, if you really hate Cersei, it can be pretty satisfying to watch her construct her own doom).<br /><br />3) WHAT'S WITH THE NICKNAMES?<br /><br />I'll give you that one: Referring to various POV characters as \\"The Kraken's Daughter\\" and \\"The Soiled Knight\\" and all that jazz gets on my nerves. But it's not as if it destroys the storylines. It's just something annoying you have to deal with every once in a while when you start a new chapter, and once you've mastered who all the abstract titles refer to, it's hardly an issue at all.<br /><br />4) STRANGER DANGER<br /><br />Bigger is the problem of all the new additions to the POV lineup. Some of these characters we have heard of before, some are just now making their Song of Ice and Fire debut. I won't lie and say I was immediately fond of hearing from these strangers. It took some getting used to, but I quickly found these new perspectives to open refreshing and much-needed viewpoints on the corners of Westeros that were previously ignored. In the past few books, I found myself wondering about the Iron Islands and Dorne, just as I still find myself wondering about unexplored places like the Basilisk Isles and Valyria with its mysterious Doom. You can't prevent such curiosity from occurring, especially not with those fabulous maps included at the start of every book, and by introducing Asha Greyjoy, Victarion Greyjoy, Arianne Martell and others as POV characters, Martin helps satisfy that curiosity. His classic detailed writing style sucks you in, so that even as you're thinking, \\"who are these weirdos?\\" you find yourself wondering how their stories will end and, even more importantly, what their repercussions might be for Westeros and the wider world, for I simply refuse to believe Martin included their perspectives just to add pages.<br /><br />Let's not forget, either, that not all the faces are new and strange. Veterans like Arya, Samwell, and Sansa are still around, even if the book is lacking some of the old favorites. Which brings me to my final point...<br /><br />5) WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH DAENERYS, TYRION, AND JON SNOW???<br /><br />This is, by far, the single most universal criticism of A Feast for Crows. It was a gutsy move, cutting out what are probably the three most-loved characters in the entire series. I mourned their absence myself, especially Tyrion's (they can't possibly be planning to take Peter Dinklage out of an entire season of Game of Thrones, can they?) but I can admit that the three of them, while they added a lot of humanity and depth to the series, did not define it. A Song of Ice and Fire goes on without them--forever tainted, some have argued, by their absence--but it goes on, giving new characters an opportunity to earn our sympathy and our disgust, shedding light on unexplored places, describing meals with its usual fervor. And if you find yourself longing terribly for Daenerys, Tyrion, and Jon, know that your 1000-page wait will be rewarded in A Dance with Dragons.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This movie is one of the best dance movies of it's time. The Tatum/Dewan collabo was a great match. Not only is he ridiculously hot...he has some serious moves. I absolutely luv this movie and can watch it over & over again! #TeamTatum4Life!
0062060554|5.0|I really enjoyed this mystery.  I had more or less started to figure out the mystery, but it didn't matter.  This was a great mystery and one that everyone should read.  S.J. Watson did a great job keeping my interest.  I think it would make a great movie.  It would be one that would keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you guessing.  Thanks for a very good book.

B003V1WTMM|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book.  The story was enjoyable and really easy to read.  It really kept my attention.  The only thing that I didn't like was all of the descriptions.  For every new scene of the book there was a new beyond detailed description of the room, the people, etc.  At some points it was nice but others you just wanted to get back to the story.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This story will stay with me.  I definitely recommend reading this one.  It makes you think the whole time.  It was so well written that even with such a heavy topic, it was an easy to read.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Jason Isaacs is always interesting, and this is no exception. Originally seen in the U. S. on Masterpiece Theatre: a high quality production that I was happy to find it on instant video. Worth watching more than once, especially for the Scottish landscapes.

0439023521|5.0|I am 25 and I loved reading the three Hunger Games books. They are interesting (even if you have read lots of dystopian novels), engaging pageturners that will make you wish there were more to read. Do yourself a favor and check them out!
0345803485|1.0|Fortunately, I borrowed this book from the library.  I've read about 120 pages.  The writing is so bad I laugh out loud.  My favorite part so far is where he shows her his bondage room and his rules and all she says is she can't accept his money for clothes.<br /><br />Is she a complete idiot?  I guess so because this virgin hops right into bed with this stranger because he's \\"hot\\".  She's never been attracted to anyone until this bozo?  Is it a case of fat wallet attraction?<br /><br />Mr. Wonderful has the most uninspired sex with her and follows that up with a scene from Phantom of the Opera.  Of course he's a brooding concert pianist instead of passed out like any other man.<br /><br />So glad I avoided the Twilight trash.<br /><br />Snoopy wrote better \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\"
0061692042|2.0|This book was okay, the plot like, I mean. However, after getting 139 pages into it, I simply could not find the motivation to continue. I like page-turners, but I also like prose. This book spent an entire chapter flitting around a single thought, action, or phrase. Get to the point! It was like the author was trying to be extra \\"lyrical\\" just because he liked the sound of his own prose. If you love \\"lyrical\\" books, go for it. You will probably like this. I did not so much enjoy it.
0743454537|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008WBHA9S Cheer: A Novel]], I am always inspired by Jodi Picoult's novels about families, but I was especially moved by this one.  My Sister's Keeper is a highly readable but also nuanced tale of a family caught in a plain rotten situation.  It remains one of the most heart-wrenching and surprising stories I've ever read.  Highly recommend for lover's of women's fiction.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|I really liked it. Action packed and full of American justice. A movie well done. My husband advised me against watching it because he's not really into action movies like this one, but I'm glad I did. Definitely worth the time.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game to play all kinds of cool animals and love scrat fighting the fish so fun and cool to play
B008JH5CVS|3.0|I was so hoping for a great sci-fi/action movie with Lock Out. Not so much.... The girl lead was ridiculous and worthless. All I kept thinking was \\"if this was really happening, our hero would have just shot her at least three different times\\" She was not worth saving, not worth his time at at any point. Now the good stuff - it had some laugh out loud moments (not sure if they were intentional or not, but funny all the same) and some of the action was well done. All in all, not one of the great sci-fi action movies I will watch again, but worthy of a rainy night inside.
B000SEIK2S|1.0|While I enjoyed the premise and execution of the book, the level of vulgar language was way too high for my personal tolerances. Your mileage may vary, but if four-letter words aren't your thing, I'd recommend staying away.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|As a relatively new distance runner, I have found inspiration in a few places, and this is one of them. I was and still am interested n the minimalist footwear pursuit, but this book goes beyond that and dealves into a limited glimpse of a man who loved what he did and where he did it, but it also relates to many who showed up for a race that shouldn't have happened, and how the participants all interacted with the environment, and the race organizer.<br />The story is well written, and informative, as well as entertaining and inspiring.. Where are my running shoes??

Compared to other apps even lousy ones this apps radar map is sub-standard. I wish it would be improved because it's the feature I use most often in apps of this nature. Everything else is superior in my observations, but untill the radar portion is improved looks like its back to weatherbug for us, since accuweather's radar is not reliable.

B0058YPG1G|2.0|The DVD series came in on time and looked great, but when you put in the DVD to any DVD player, it makes an extremely loud and annoying sound.  it makes the DVD player work extremely hard and it sounds like it is a jet engine.  None of my other DVD's make this sound.  Not only does it sound loud, but it takes forever to play.  I ended up not even playing them because not all of the disks work.  I found the series on Netflix and watched it there.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|To be honest, I am not really a fan of romance/sex books but I gave in and wanted to see what all the hype on the Fifty Shades book were.  I was very disappointed, to say the least.  These books could have been written by a teenager, which I actually looked up to see if the author was in fact a young adult.  If I heard the lead character speak to her inner Goddess one more time I think I might have lost it.  Everyone made it out like the books were so risque, but after the 1st book the sex scenes are very \\"vanilla\\".  Do Not recommend wasting your money.
B001O1O71C|4.0|The Holocaust is a subject that I wouldn't recommend writing about unless you've lived through it, and yet John Boyne has done an exceptional job of representing one of the most incomprehensible chapters in humanity's history with The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, a fictional novel. I am always very nervous and cautious reading stories about the Holocaust because each account is different yet equally horrific. Despite the time I have spent studying the Holocaust while earning my degree in Religious Studies, I can never get used to hearing about the experiences and tend to read more juvenile literature which isn't quite as graphic (i.e. The Diary of Anne Frank and my personal favorite Upon the Head of a Goat: A Childhood in Hungary). This novel delivers the gravity of the Holocaust, but through the eyes of a child who has no understanding of the horrors surrounding him, making it a less difficult read emotionally than anticipated.<br /><br />The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is told from the third-person perspective of 9-year old Bruno, the son of the commanding officer of Auschwitz, the most deadly of Hitler's death camps. Bruno has no real understanding of World War II and the Holocaust other than his juvenile interpretation of the world around him. After leaving Berlin to relocate to Auschwitz and bored out of his mind, Bruno goes exploring and meets Shmuel, a boy on the other side of the fence. Bruno and Shmuel develop a friendship despite their differences, illustrating that they aren't that different at all.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the innocence captured in this book and how it gave a new lens with which to view history. In the Author's Note, Boyne says, \\"I believed that the only respectful way for me to deal with this subject was through the eyes of a child, and particularly through the eyes of a very naive child who couldn't possibly understand the terrible things that were taking place around him.\\" Boyne does an excellent job executing this method and somehowfinds a way of showing the humanity of the enemy through Bruno.<br /><br />Boyne creates Bruno's world through a series of innocent misunderstandings (i.e. 'Heil Hitler,' [Bruno] said, which, he presumed was another way of saying, 'Well, goodbye for now, have a pleasant afternoon.'), clever writing, and dramatic irony (Bruno's perspective of his life versus Shmuel's is: \\"there's no one to talk to and no one to play with and you get to have dozens of friends and are probably playing for hours every day.\\" As readers we know that Bruno is very wrong.). We also witness Bruno's indoctrination of beliefs through his family ('Germany is the greatest of all countries,' Bruno replied, remembering something that he had overheard Father discussing with Grandfather on any number of occasions. 'We're superior.') which encourages us to question the validity our own beliefs we've had since children and inherited from our families.<br /><br />The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not perfect, however. Obviously, many readers may not appreciate the simple platform on which such a grave and devastating topic is discussed. Another complaint is the translation issues. Bruno makes it clear that he and his family speak German; however, he mispronounces Auschwitz as \\"Out-With\\" and his sister explains, 'Out with the people who lived here before us, I expect,' - which makes no sense if translated into German. (For the record, \\"out with\\" in English translated to German is raus mit, I checked to make sure my complaint was reasonable). Similarly, Bruno misunderstands Hitler's title the fuhrer, calling him \\"The Fury\\"; to English readers this is funny and ironic, but \\"fury\\" translated into German is wut and this misunderstanding loses its punch.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was a simple read and not very long, proving you don't need a complicated book to illustrate a powerful message. While I'd like to believe we live in a more tolerant world today, the truth is that we can always be reminded of how much we have in common with even those who are most different from us. Bruno and Shmuel had a physical fence between them, but what fences do we put up every day between ourselves and others?

B0058UXHHK|4.0|Denise Grover Swank's humorous, cozy mystery is an enjoyable read. With a little touch of paranormal, Rose Gardner worms her way into readers' hearts. From the southern dialect to Rose's knack for getting herself into big trouble, there isn't much to stop readers from speeding through Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes.<br /><br />This mystery is more contemporary romance than thrilling suspense at certain points in the novel. The plot has murder and crime, and Rose is the prime suspect, but there just seems to be more waiting around for the answers to just fall into her lap. She went about bettering herself and her life, as evidenced by the list of twenty-eight wishes to complete before she is arrested, or worse, killed. Rose waits for trouble to find her and it isn't until near the end of the story that Rose takes charge of bringing the crime investigations to an end.<br /><br />Though a few ends could have been tied up more clearly, Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes was consistently entertaining and a sweet opening to The Rose Gardner Mystery series!<br /><br />Originally posted on Lovey Dovey Books

0985114606|1.0|I can't believe this isn't considered plagiarism.  So many parts of this books seem far too close to Fifty Shades to have been the author's original idea.  This is the first review I have ever written, and I am finally writing because I am pretty disgusted both by the author and the publisher for their attempt to cash in on what seem to be in many ways someone else's ideas.  Many other people comment that the writing of this book is better than Fifty Shades, but I completely disagree.  There is very little character development, so little that I never caught on to why the characters fell in love in the first place-there was simply nothing there to love.  Their relationship was painfully superficial. I nearly didn't finish the book except that the sex scenes were interesting.  That's about it, though.  I will not be buying the next book, and I really have no interest in reading anything else this author writes again.  Terrible disappointment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Although there was not a loveable character in this whole book, the suspense made it impossible to tear myself away from the story.  I did not like the ending, but I will not go as far as some readers and say I felt cheated.  The author ended it the way she thought best and that is her prerogative.  It was a great story and I would recommend it.

0553801473|1.0|The series started with such promise, but quickly degenerated into a never-ending cash cow for the author and publisher. The really sad thing is that when he is writing an actual story line, it's well-crafted and engaging, even gripping at times. But between those few nuggets are endless pages of trivial nonsense, the heraldry of insignificant knights, what foods are laid out at every meal, page after page of nonsensical detail that contribute nothing and blur the tale. All this makes the individual books too long to come to any resolution, and the specific characters have their stories chopped into slivers, scattered across the books, so even if you start to connect with someone in particular you lose interest before finding another chapter for them. Characters enter the tale, get abandoned for long stretches, often die (sometimes just briefly mentioned by some other character), and more characters are brought in to replace them. The result - so far - is a series of disjointed, plodding narratives with some hint of a story line in the background. Give it up before wasting any more time and money in what seems to be a bottomless pit. There are so many good books out there, don't spend your time on these.

1469984202|5.0|I knew I had to read Wool when my brother, an avid reader, told me it was the best book he had read in years. I tried to get it from the library, but with only one copy in circulation and a hold going back some 30 patrons,I ended up reading all of the books on my Kindle in just two days- and ruining my bedtime in the process.

While \\"...Played With Fire\\" might not be perfect, it won't matter if you've already invested in the Salander and Blomqvist story.  You will race through #2 and eagerly anticipate the last book, \\"...Hornet's Nest.\\"  The entire story is compelling, socially elucidating, and a truly fun ride.  Along with thousands of other readers, I am truly sad that Larsson isn't here to feed my hunger for more...

0307730697|5.0|From May through July 2011, author Eric Blehm traveled around the U.S. interviewing the members of Navy Seal Team SIX, the ones who had just taken out bin Laden, and had lost one of their members, Chief Special Warfare Operator Adam Brown.<br /><br />Adam and his twin, Manda, were born February 5, 1974. His dad was an electrician who moved the family frequently, whenever he could find a job. Adam, his brother Shawn, and his sister lived a nomadic life, often in a used 35 foot trailer, staying in campgrounds or trailer parks throughout Arkansas, Colorado, Montana, Louisiana, and Nevada. In one year alone, the kids went to 6 different schools.<br /><br />Adam was small in stature, but tough as nails and known for being kind, honest and trustworthy. Somewhat of a surprise to his football coach, Adam always wanted to take on the largest players during drills.  His parents would often find him leaping off the hood of the car, or a bridge or other crazy stunts. As daring as Adam was, he was doubly as kind.  Blehm's writing makes you feel you're right there in the action. The stories of Adam sticking up for his sister and protecting a schoolmate who had Down Syndrome from bullies make you want to give this kid a hug.<br /><br />In his senior year of high school, Adam saw an action-packed preview for the movie 'Navy SEALs,' in which Charlie Sheen played Lt. Dale Hawkins. From that time on, Adam's interest was piqued. Unfortunately, his college years were not easy. Adam struggled to find direction in his life and got involved with the 'wrong crowd.' He had trouble with drinking and drugs. His work ethic and his attitude suffered. Adam struggled to overcome his poor choices and addiction.<br /><br />About halfway through the book Adam's journey to become a Navy SEAL unfolds. The physical and mental challenges were, to me, unimaginable and I couldn't put the book down. Adam reached the top tier of the Navy SEALS, SEAL Team Six, the 'best of the best.' True to his character, Adam was devoted to his teammates and others. He organized a church drive to send sneakers to the Afghan children, when he realized they only had sandals during the bitter cold winters.<br /><br />Adam became a devoted husband and father, who gave the glory to God for the turnaround in his life. Adam's story is a reminder that it is possible to turn your life around and that God has the power to do what seems impossible.<br /><br />Adam's story is truly inspirational, and I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
0345803485|1.0|This is by far the worst book I've read. It is twilight wrapped in sex wrped in ICD-9 codes of the psych diagnoses book wrapped in more sex and topped with no plot with a side of actors who are so one dimensional it hurts my brain since I can't unread this. Its gross and depressing that an adult (ANA) can be so can be so clueless and allow for herself to be physically abused and that she actually swallowed semen-GROSS!!!. The repitition in this book is ridiculous. She was biting her lip so much, its hard to believe she didn't need medical help to stitch it back up. And the guy, Christian is so annoying with his stupid \\"did you eat\\" statements.

034580404X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the books and following Christian and Ana's relationship from its beginning and how both characters changed throughout the course of the books.  Like other reviewers I enjoyed the flow of the book, reading their daily life.  When I finished book three, I wanted more.  The quick glimpse at how Christian saw his and Ana's first meeting was just not enough.  I would love to read this series from his point of view just to see more into his mind and his internal struggles as his character changes.<br /><br />All in all a great series and I would recommend to anyone :)
B007H9B6KA|5.0|I love this album. The music is strong and the lyrics are to the point and in your face. And, as usual, the recording and production values are off the scale. I am very happy to hear from Garbage after 7 years. Welcome back!
1469984202|4.0|Mr. Howey put me in another world. The characters were fleshed out,<br />the narrative moved at a good clip, there was enough suspense to<br />keep me turning the pages until only eye strain would force me to stop.But<br />Wool is not completely without flaws. A lot is covered on the social implications<br />of silo living, which is absolutely essential to the story, but the basic physical<br />challenges of living in a silo could have been explored further (for example,<br />the profound lack of sunlight). I think that would have added texture<br />to the harshness of their environment, hence lending to reasons why one would<br />want to go outside.<br /><br />Also, when the story began to expand around the middle of Book<br />Four, there were places that got a bit murky. I had trouble<br />figuring out the logistics of certain circumstances. I wish I could<br />provide you with examples, but doing so would give away too much of<br />the story. But these very minor shortcomings do not diminish from the<br />overall entertainment value that Wool provides. I look forward to reading<br />Part Six.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|This classic film by the great Alfred Hitchcock just got even better than we ever dreamed it could or would by the development of Blu-ray.  The print is sharp and stunning.  The newly worked sound is a definite addition to the atmosphere of this wonderful horror story; tho the 2.0 mono track is available as a choice.  It was interesting to pick certain key portions of the film and start them in 5.1 and switch mid stream to 2.0 mono to immediately hear the differences on certain aspects such as the rain when driving to and arriving at the Bates Motel, the shower scene, and the submersion of the car in the lake.  Although I hasten to add, the 2.0 mono track itself sounds great on this Blu-Ray!<br /><br />The huge array of bonus features just adds hours of enjoyment and detail to the Blu-Ray edition.  Interviews, music information, behind the scenes filming details, insets of the master himself, plus comments from his wife and daughter I thought were just too good to be true.<br /><br />There is a lot of enjoy for a very reasonable price on this Blu-Ray anniversary film and if you are a fan of what many consider Hitchcock's very best film, I would recommend adding this classic to your Blu-Ray library.

B006LSZECO|4.0|initially enthralled; part two, however, did not flow with the beginning so that you yearn for the book you started.  it began to get silly, the characters so unlikeable, secondary characters too hazy to be interested in.  by the end, you wonder if the author just grew tired and lazily ended the drama.  disappointed.  but then again, should have known many of the best sellers are about as fulfilling as a britney spears song.
B001BVRNPW|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo19DLXMZ47TFKH]]Pros: Good Movie, nice extras if you can get the disc to play<br /><br />Cons: When first purchased this Blu-Ray in late 2008, I found there was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) lockout that prevented some players (including mine) from playing the disc even though everything was fully updated at the time.  Fast forward to 2012.... I decided to buy the Blu-Ray again, figuring 4 years is long enough for a new master to get into circulation.  No such luck.  I even bought a 2nd used copy hoping for a different batch.  Same problem.<br /><br />To be specific, the Mastering error (or intentional) locks out Cyberlink PowerDVD 10, 11 and ArcSoft Total Media players, even if they are updated to patches dated 2012 which is well past this title's release date.  What you get is an annoying red \\"update your player\\" & \\" we are not responsible...\\" disclaimer screen. (See below). When you go to the URL on the screen, all it does is takes you to a general Blu-Ray advisory site which links the same updates you can get from the Player manufacturer's own web sites.  I had one tech support rep suggest I could try buying another player, but I think that's out of the question at $60 and up with no guarantee it would work.<br /><br />The irony is I could watch this movie via a pristine Torrent download which was obviously copied from this same Blu-Ray and posted to the web.  In effect, the only people blocked here are the honest folk who have (as in my case) spent money 3 times to get a Blu-Ray that would actually play.  Perhaps I will try again, in another 4 years...

B004IY6API|5.0|When one thinks of Judas Priest, they think of many songs that are staples of their live shows and even classic rock radio - \\"Breaking The Law,\\" \\"Living After Midnight,\\" \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming,\\" \\"Heading Out To The Highway,\\" and \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" to name a few. Certainly these songs (among others) are favorites of many rock and metal enthusiasts around the world. But many people don't really give much thought to this album, which was truly a work ahead of its time. Released in 1978, it took all the elements of blues and psychedelia that were prevalent in the earliest forms of metal music and tossed them right out the window. This sound was driven by dramatic and rather bombastic vocals, a dual guitar attack, and a very tight rhythm section. This album is perhaps the darkest of the long Priest catalog, and has some baggage attached to it (-cough- UNNECESSARY COURT CASE -cough-). But all the songs rank among their best work, and the album helped to lay the foundation for the 1980s New Wave of British Heavy Metal.<br /><br />A major reason it is probably overlooked is the fact that the band does not represent it live very often. Another reason is that a majority of the songs seem more accessible to the metal enthusiasts and don't really seem like they'd become staples of classic rock radio. The overall sense of darkness on tracks such as \\"Beyond The Realms of Death\\" and their cover of \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" (originally by Spooky Tooth), the rather explicitly violent lyrics on the title track and \\"Saints In Hell\\" certainly may be turnoffs for some. The opening number, \\"Exciter,\\" was unheard of at the time; songs by the likes of Queen and Deep Purple may have flirted with the speed metal tempo before, but never had it sounded quite so intense as it does here; pummeling double bass drums, fast staccato picking, and composition that ultimately strayed from the norm of the time. Come to think of it - the whole album really is pretty well composed, and no two songs really seem to follow the exact same formula. If you want to hear something Judas Priest never really replicated, a band making possibly the most METAL record of the 1970s... well, Stained Class is your ticket. Riff for riff, solo for solo, scream for scream, every track is a gem.<br /><br />On a side note, the bonus tracks aren't really worth much. \\"Fire Burns Below\\" sounds like a very mediocre reject from the Turbo album, and the live version of \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" is not all that different from what you hear on the studio version. But they do not factor in to my giving this album a perfect score, as it is for the original 9 tracks.nd no two songs really seem to follow the exact same formula.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I consider myself an avid reader with far too little time to read.  Accordingly, I resisted picking up this book for some time, due in large part to the many negative reviews that criticized the poor writing rather than the soft porn content.  I am not a prude (far from it), am not offended by bondage, and have happily red this genre before vis a vis Ann Rice's Sleeping Beauty series (which was pretty good).  Thus, I can honestly say that I was looking forward to the sexual content, and even suggested that my husband and I read it at the same time to give us food for discussion and maybe even some \\"ideas.\\"  I didn't even make it 1/4 way through the book before I had to raise the white flag and admit that I simply could NOT stomach another word.  I have read plenty of mindless books with less than decent writing in my day, and believe that there is a time and place for less cerebral stories, but this one was so damn ridiculous that I had to put it down....for good.  \\"So what\\" you say, \\"alot of people don't finish books\\", right......wrong.  I have never, and I repeat never NOT finished a book.  Although it often pains me, I have a compulsion that makes me finish what I started, and I have waded through plenty of horrible books in the name of this disorder.  So, for me to delete this off my Kindle for good says a great deal.<br /><br />Where to begin.  First, Anastasia is a completely unbelievable character in every way, from her \\"never had a desire to have sex\\" persona in the beginning of the book to her electric eel orgasms that actually made me cringe.  A good book allows you to identify with a character and hang on their every work and move, even if they are completely different from you in gender, age, economic status, sexual orientation or otherwise.  Take Ignatius Reilly in Confederacy of Dunces.  I have NOTHING in common with that character, but I identified with his quirky nature.  Despite being an educated woman with an enviable sex life, I could not relate to Anastasia in any way.  Secondly, the book repeats things over and over and over.  From \\"he is SO Hot\\" in describing Christian Gray to talking about sexual arousal as \\"heat.\\"  I feel like the author ran out of synonyms and lost his thesaurus.  Ok, I can't spend any more time even thinking about this book, so have decided to keep the myriad of other valid criticisms to myself.<br /><br />Needless to say, if you are a sex-starved housewife who could care less about reality or decent writing (aka a Harlequin Romance Novel junkie) than this might be the book for you.  Everybody else, beware.
B00846REIS|1.0|Recent college grad (Eva), meets billionaire (Gideon)... sound familiar?  Wait, it gets better, she actually falls (where Anastasia Steele trips).  The story follows 50 Shades here on out, I think the only thing missing in Bared to You was the red room of pain and the helicopter!  Then again, that could be forthcoming in the next two books.  The similarities are just plain insulting ... Eva even has a \\"safeword.\\"<br /><br />The book is 50 Shades repackaged with a different cover, new names and new city.  Don't waste your time!  It's no wonder the author self-published (until Penquin Group took over the rights).

0062009540|5.0|Sunday, August 12, 2012Pretty is in the Eyes of the Beholder<br />Pretty Little Liars by Sara Shephard<br />Teen Fiction<br /><br />Once upon a time, five little girls decided to play a big girl's game and one of them ended up the ultimate loser.  Hanna, Aria, Spencer, Emily and Alison are best friends and the worst kind of enemy--one who knows all your secrets.<br /><br />At first, the book reminded me of the Clique series except every third word wasn't a brand name.  And, these pretty little liars play for keeps.  This is a story of bullying gone extreme, a Queen Bee (Alison) who pushes her BFF's until one snaps and the Queen winds up dead. But which of them is guilty of the deed?  All are too scared to say and all are secretly a little glad the Queen Bee, Alison, disappeared.  And, yet, if they had to be honest......their lives are not better for her death.<br /><br />This mystery is so addictive!  The plot line develops slowly and had me guessing which of the other teens could be the guilty one (still haven't decided!) and what exactly happened to Alison on that fateful night and why!  In the end, everyone is a suspect-a move that would make even Agatha Christie proud.<br /><br />I literally could not stop reading it once I started.  It is full of juicy gossip, teen naughtiness and unexpected plot turns.  In my opinion, completely inappropriate for anyone younger than a teen, I (as an adult) was enchanted and rushed straight to the second one in the series.

B000I9TY4G|4.0|I wish firefly had kept going.  I am a big fan of Joss Wheaton  I only discovered this show on Amazon. I wish I had seen the episodes for this show while it was on the air. I have a strong feeling that this cast and story line would have been as big a hit as Star trek in its time.  If only there had been a way of getting it launched biggeer into the public eye.  There are so many people who love Buffy,Angel,Doll house and watch them repeatedly as strange new fun.  The color, picture and volume though out was great.  I enjoyed it all I will not spoil the delight in watching this movie for anyone else but its worth owning and sharing with friends on movie night!!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I thought the music was incredible. That is why I bought the sound track.  I adore Julianne Hough, and she sings several of these songs.  If you like 80's music, I recommend this CD.

0312370849|5.0|After reading this wonderful book you will never forget the events of July 16, 1942.  The author has done a great job relating a darn good fictional story tied to the events of that day.  I found this to be a real page turner.  If you like human interest stories about Paris or France during World War II you will find this most interesting.  Even if you don't -  this is an absolutely good read that will hold your interest right to the last page.  It is not a battlefield story and it is not specifically about the details of life in the camps. Little Sarah's story will be with me for years to come and all things considered that is the very good result of reading this book.  It will help me to \\"Never Forget\\" July 16, 1942.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I wished they'd show stanford n anthony in here more. In all the episodes you see them in there always. I like Anthony and Stanford. But now that it was a movie, they were mostly based on these 4 women. I get annoyed when its all about Carrie. She has 3 other great friends that deserved more movie time. That movie was more like about Carrie, it all evolved around her. I loved the series, but the last 2 movies were all about Carrie. I loved seeing Charlotte and Samantha. But Mirandas scenes were as always...boring. Wished they showed more of the guys in the flicks. The guys who loved these women, supported them. I loved the parts not always involving Carrie. When they arrived in Abu Dahbi, Carrie makes a big deal out of Charlotte not using her Married last name. And Carrie uses \\"Bradshaw\\"like shes supposed to be the one to use the maiden name. Annoying.<br />I wished it showed more of the 3 other girls. But theyre short and the scene goes right back to Carrie. Shouldve been named Sex and the City: Carrie Bradshaw
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great cover of a rubber like material that seems to protect the Kindle quite well, the front portions folds all the way around to the back when using the Kindle so it is not in the way.  I can't think of any design I would like any better than this.

B0089IGUP4|4.0|I have been a fan of Gaslight Anthem since 59 Sound came out. Let me say the band would be hard pressed to ever beat that release.  If you don't have it yet, get it.  Anyone who compares a new release from this great band to 59 Sound as a benchmark is foolish.  It is too high of a standard to meet.  If they ever do it god bless them.<br /><br />With that said, this is a really solid release. I Loved 59 Sound, liked American Slang with my one criticism there being how short it is at 31 minutes. I found that lame.  Handwritten comes in at 41 minutes.  If you get the deluxe edition the bonus tracks add another 10 or so minutes.<br /><br />The songwriting has matured. Not as many lyrics about lost youth and growing up.  The music is tight and fun.<br /><br />If I had one critical thing to say about the band it is this. The lyrics use at lot of the same phrases and themes going back to their first release. Lots of mentions of soul, wombs, fire, dark, night, moons, etc.  A lot of their faster tempo songs also sound the same.  Same tempo, same structure, etc.  However, with most bands it would be a turn-off.  But the way these guys do it, I don't mind at all.  They have their own style and sound unique to today's music scene where I accept it.  It is interesting how different characters or themes show up in different songs and I can appreciate that.<br /><br />With the exception of Foo Fighters and Killers, this might be the best band around today.  Most people compare them to Bruce Springsteen. They sound and look a lot more like a mid-80's The Replacements to me.

I don't buy this book to him as it may be too early for him and it seems he won't be interested to this book. But it comes up to be totally wrong! He is interested to this book and read all the pages, it really surprise me! He reads this book every day! I highly recommend this book.

0307592731|5.0|It is possible to see Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Coast Trail as similar to John Krakauer's book, Into the Wild, the tale of the life and death of Chris McCandless in the Alaska wilderness (1) (see my review of this book). Chris McCandless and Cheryl Strayed were of a similar twenty something age, Cheryl being some four or five years older than Chris. On the surface, both seemed to view venturing into the wilderness as a way to test themselves and gain insight and understandings about themselves.  And both were essentially unprepared and ill equipped for the test they set for themselves.(2)  But here the stories diverge.    Chris was a total romantic about the redeeming powers of wilderness.  After graduating from college he gave away all of his money and ditched his old car.  Again and again he would launch into wilderness experiences with little or no preparation and the implicit belief that the wilderness was benign and would shelter and protect him.  Of course, it did not. (3)    Cheryl on the other hand had struggled with several demons in the years beyond college.  She was married early to a man she loved but was unable to be faithful to.  The death of her mother at age forty-two devastated her.  And she became addicted to heroin.  In an effort to redeem herself and turn her life around, she divorced her husband, kicked her heroin habit and somehow latched onto hiking the 1300 mile Pacific Coast Wilderness Trail: California as a way to come to grips with all of her personal issues.    Unlike McCandless, Cheryl was not unprepared for her adventure.  She had read the trail guide over and over.  She had been to the REI store many times for advice and to secure the equipment she thought she would need.  She had prepared re-supply boxes for a friend to ship to post offices along the trail as she would need them.  She was not completely unprepared for her adventure, but in many ways she was not well prepared either, and she was naïve about the demands,both physical and personal, she would face.    I think I liked this book for many of the same reasons that I liked Warren Richey's book, Without a Paddle (see my review of this book).  Richey used the challenge of the Florida circumnavigation race as a personal physical challenge, and way to be alone with his thoughts after a difficult divorce.  He used the time alone as time to reflect and gain perspective on what had happened.  His story swung between the very real physical challenges of the trail and his equally challenging inner struggles.  Strayed's story has the same Yin and Yang as Richey's.  And they both have a way of using humor to lighten the darkness of their struggles.    To my surprise, I found I could relate to many of the feelings in Strayed's book.  I can't say that I ever picked up women in bars or had one-night stands.  I've never done drugs of any kind, though alcohol has played a role in my life.  But I have been divorced and left with a lot of pain and questions that needed sorting out.  And I have sought out \\"wilderness\\" as a place to be alone with my thoughts.  Like the Richey book, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Coast Trail, will not appeal to everyone.  The hike is really the background story, the sub-context here.  But there are enough personal and physical challenges confronted in this book that those readers with some years of living or difficult life experiences under their belts will relate to.  In that sense the book has universal appeal.    NOTES:  (1)  While in Alaska I passed along the Teklanika River in Denali National Park, within a few miles of the abandoned school bus where Chris McCandless lived and died.  It is truly wild country.    (2) It should be noted that the McCandless book was written by Krakauer from research he did on Chris's life, while the Strayed book was written by Cheryl herself, many years after her adventure.  If Chris had been able to write about his adventure many years after the fact, his story might sound different.    (3) See [...]

0307387178|5.0|If The Final Frontiersman represents the \\"Yin\\" of outdoor stories, then Into the Wild represents the \\"Yang\\". (1)  Heimo Korth (The Final Frontiersman.  See my review) grew up in a blue-collar family experiencing the violent anger of an alcoholic father.  He took to the woods at an early age to avoid the anger at home.  Chris McCandless, the focus of Into the Wild, grew up in a well-to-do Atlanta family, having money and privilege.  Heimo had a first hand, practical knowledge of living in the outdoors.  Chris held romanticized notions of escaping to the wild as a form of salvation.  Heimo Korth learned and thrived in the Alaskan wilderness for twenty years.  Chris McCandless died of sickness and starvation after only four months in a much less remote part of Alaska.<br /><br /> I have read several of Jon Krakauer's books and they are all great reads.  This is no exception.  Drawing on police reports, interviews and Chris's own journals, Krakauer weaves together a complete story from widely dispersed bits of information.  Pulling from highlights and margin notes in the books Chris carried, Krakauer paints a picture of a young man who rejects his roots for adventure and romantic ideas of living in nature.  Chris has no background or experience to temper his romantic notions.  Naming himself \\"Alexander Supertramp\\", McCandless heads out in an old Toyota, making his way through the south, west and upper mid-west before heading for Alaska to go \\"into the wild\\".  Along the way, he abandons his car in the desert and gives away all of his savings, some $25,000.00.  He lives by working odd jobs and hitching rides.  Chris makes good friends along the way, but nothing seems to hold him.  Eventually he heads to Alaska to test himself by going \\"into the wild\\".  Wilderness was to be his salvation.  Yet in four short months it killed him.<br /><br /> The story of how Chris McCandless gave up his privileged life, giving away all his worldly assets to live in trailer camps and work asa common laborer, is fascinating.  Even more compelling is the tragedy that befalls his ill-fated expedition into the Alaskan wilderness.  Krakauer does a masterful job of drawing on sketchy information, mixing it with conjecture and logical consequences to assemble a picture of McCandless's final months and days.  When Alexander Supertramp's body is finally found by moose hunters, he has been dead for more than two weeks.<br /><br /> This is a great book and a great read.  It has been made into a motion picture, which is equally good.  I recommend both.<br /><br />￼<br /> NOTES:<br />(1) Yin yang are opposing<br />  Yin yang describe opposing qualities in phenomena.

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I read this book expecting a typical, high school English classic (not that I don't like typical high school classics!) but this is seriously one of the cutest, most enjoyable books I've ever read! Tom is such a character... I can totally see why Disney recreated his island in California! Although the adventures of Tom Sawyer maybe aren't quite as famous as Huckleberry's adventures, personally, I'm a little partial to Tom's :)  If you're deciding whether this will be your next read or not, I'd advise you to pick it up as quick as you can. It will definitely be worth it. (Plus it's free on the kindle!)
B001HADE00|5.0|I had never really gave Ratt a chance I just knew them for their popular songs like Back For More And Round And Round. Then one day i decided to learn Ratt Back for More on guitar so I borrowed the cd. Then i was like if this song is awesome maybe i should check out their other songs. So I listened to the whole album about three times and after that I was hooked. Every song on this album is great and Warren Demartini and Crosby are great guitar players. So after that I checked out Invasion of Privacy and that whole album is good too. Buy these two albums they certainly won't disappoint.
B000244FDW|5.0|This is the best adaptation of the novel I have seen so far. Both Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are faithful characters, the latter being very restrained, but consistently so both with his own persona and with the age which he lived in. The actors play remarkably well, and it does not end up being an over-sweetened romantic story as in some other adaptations.

B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Some of us might still remember the three gray whales trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska, in 1988, and Operation Breakthrough, an international effort to rescue them. Based on a book \\"Freeing the Whales: How the Media Created the World's Greatest Non-Event\\" written by Tom Rose, \\"Big Miracle\\" follows how the stranding of three whales leads to the \\"big miracle\\" involving environmentalists, oil companies, the Inuit, the governor and finally, two superpowers, through the pre-internet media.<br /><br />There are several narrative threads woven together. John Krasinski plays a local reporter Adam Carlson. Drew Barrymore is a Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer. It is suggested that they were once dating but then split up. The stranded whales bring them back together. The two have nice chemistry, but more interesting is the real-life based story of Colonel Scott Boyer (Dermot Mulroney), a National Guard pilot and Kelly Meyers (Vinessa Shaw), an executive assistant for Cabinet affairs at White House. Also, two Alaskan actors John Pingayak as Inupiat whaler Malik and Ahmaogak Sweeney as his grandson Nathan steal every scene they are in.<br /><br />\\"Big Miracle\\" is a family picture, but not all happy moments. While the film has a positive message, it also does not forget the self-interested agendas of some people for saving the whales. The media extravaganza is depicted with humor and cynicism. Director Ken Kwapis (\\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\") keeps the action moving with credible characters and locations (filmed in Alaska). He portrays the characters with sympathy, but not without noting their flaws.<br /><br />\\"Big Miracle\\" was not a big hit when released theatrically. I think the well-made deserves a second chance on DVD.
B007N5YJWK|5.0|Director Alfred Hitchcock's British films of the '30's laid the groundwork for his later Hollywood career, and gave birth to what came to be known as the \\"Hitchcock Touch\\". One of the Master of Suspense's favorite themes was the \\"wrongly accused man on the run\\", and this surfaced first with THE 39 STEPS (1935), a film that's virtually a blueprint for SABOTEUR (1942) and NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959).<br /><br />With THE 39 STEPS, what is essentially a spy thriller that was adapted from a novel by John Buchan becomes something uniquely Hitchcockian. Plot devices and themes the  director would return to again and again are already fully developed in this one film. We have the likable, wrongly accused hero (Robert Donat), the cool, plucky blonde (Madeleine Carroll), the suave villain (Godfrey Tearle), the cross country chase, the dark humor, and the MacGuffin which, in this case, is a secret design for an aircraft engine wanted by a foreign agency.<br /><br />THE 39 STEPS still rates as one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films; it's fast paced and has some great set pieces with moments of genuine suspense that are up to the director's highest standards.<br /><br />Criterion's Blu-ray gives us the best image and sound on this vintage film we can hope for, having been transferred from an absolutely  beautiful, 35mm fine-grain master positive print. The extras include commentary by Hitchcock scholar Marian Keane, a documentary, \\"Hitchcock: The Early Years\\", a 1966 television interview with Hitchcock, the 1937 Lux Theater Radio adaptation of the film starring Ida Lupino and Robert Montgomery, a visual essay by Hitchcock scholar Leonard Leff, audio excerpts from Francois Truffaut's 1962 interview with Hitchcock, production drawings, and an illustrated booklet with an essay by critic David Cairns.<br /><br />I first saw THE 39 STEPS in a high school film class and have loved it ever since. This is prime Hitchcock and highly recommended.

B00873GRU4|4.0|Wow what a find - how did this one escape me for so long?<br /><br />Now here's what I have discovered more recently - book can have loads of reviews that are all positive and it becomes pretty apparent that almost all the reviews have been written by the author or their friends...Ms W...  I  have also discovered that many self published books are so riddled with grammatical and spelling mistakes that they are unreadable, which is really sad because some of these authors have great creatively and talent.  Fortunately Wool is the exception to these learnings.<br /><br />Amazingly the four and five star reviews are genuine and warranted.  This is a great read.  The book is well written, original, creative and engrossing.  I became swept up by the story line, saddened by the loss of some of my favorites and overjoyed by their triumphs.  For me that's the mark of a great author - one who creates a story and characters that the reader cares about.<br /><br />Truth be told this book is probably worth five stars, but there were a few aspects in the later part of the book that I felt stretched my supensIon of disbelief just a little too far.  I won't provide any spoilers let's just say one involved some young survivors and the other a water scene.<br /><br />If you are reading this review becaue you aren't sure about buying this book, not sure if you'll like it, maybe you are looking at some free downloads and thinking 'maybe I should just get the freebie'.  Stop!  With this book you will get your money's worth and more.  It is a great read.  I look forward to more by this author.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book has some things that can be picked apart (ie. Dysfunctional relationship and violence) but there is so much more to it than that.  The passion and need in the relationship leaves you excited and anxious at the same time.  I stayed up until who knows what  hour in the morning because I couldn't put it down.  It is a book I go back to and still get caught up in the drama and the excitement of the story. Truly one of my favorite books!
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|I read about this series and started with the first book. It is interesting too read, and the story is nice. But it is very complex, I had to check the glossary / map a thousand times, and often minor details play important roles later on. What I really didn't like was the character presentation and development. I wasn't able to get a real connection to any of the different characters. And that's really sad, because a story lives from it's actors, in my opinion. I am trying the second book at the moment to see if it is getting better, but I don't think I will complete the series, if things will not change.

Quite simply, the most remedial writing I have ever read. I am so surprised with the hype. It really is pure garbage.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This album is fantastic. I have only recently become a fan of Adam Lambert-- a bit late to the party, I must sadly admit-- but wow. I can definitely say that this is Adam at his finest. Every track just screams Adam, even the three that aren't written by him are very well tailored to how his songs sound.<br /><br />I'm not claiming to be a music expert by any means (for the record, I can barely distinguish genres) but as an artist myself, I know when something needs critique. This album is not one of those somethings. Trespassing does a far better job of portraying Adam's range than For Your Entertainment does-- and this is because it doesn't try to pack as many changes in pitch into one song as it possibly can. Don't get me wrong, I love For Your Entertainment and the titular song is one of my favourites from the album, but there is something altogether more pleasant about this album. It shows growth in his style.<br /><br />One thing I would like to note is how the songs sound when compared to each other. I saw another review that gave it one-star because the songs are too similar to each other, and this is far from the case. The songs are COHESIVE, not slightly altered duplicates of each other. A good album SHOULD have songs that can all be linked together, not songs that are all over the place. And yes, you can tell they are all from the same album, but they by no means sound alike. This has to be the one album I own that flows so easily and so beautifully from high-energy dance songs to slow, passionate and emotional songs.<br /><br />Underneath literally made me cry the first time I listened to it because all of the emotion in it when I had been dancing (and nearly crashing the car; no one said I made good decisions) only a couple of tracks earlier to the energetic and addictive Kickin' In. Trespassing, Cuckoo, and Shady are all powerful songs that will get stuck in your head and you'll find yourself grooving to even when you're not listening to them. Never Close Our Eyes is more light-hearted and less fierce, and gives you a moment to just dance with a big grin on your face instead of trying out your seductive dance moves, which I can admittedly not do as well as Mr. Lambert. Kickin' In is like an electric shock in the best kind of way. It ties with Cuckoo for my favourite song with an edge on this album. The three bonus tracks, Runnin', Take Back, and Nirvana are spectacular and definitely worth the money. I didn't mention quite a few of the songs on this album-- not because they're not memorable by any means-- but I could ramble on about the songs on this album for ages, when there is one more point I want to touch on while I have time.<br /><br />I'm going to focus on something that probably not a lot of other reviewers have: the artwork. As an artist myself, aesthetics are something I am very picky about. I will be honest when I say that I really do not like the cover of For Your Entertainment, seeing as many of the other shots were so much stronger. The Deluxe Edition cover is more desirable in terms of aesthetics. Adam's gorgeous on the regular cover of For Your Entertainment, but it's not that strong. Trespassing is a whole nother story. This album first came on my radar when I dropped by Barnes & Noble in search of an elusive TV series. I went to pay, and as it happened, they had a rack of CDs and such out for GLBT Pride, and I was immediately magnetized by the Trespassing artwork. This was the regular CD's artwork, which is beautifully composed, but it was a picture that stuck in my mind. The cover of the Deluxe Edition is just as, if not more, magnetizing. This likely mostly has to do with Adam's seductive stare, but the contrast used in the photo is just right and makes it hard to pull your eyes from. The logo is pleasant, and this entire album has made me fall in love with the yellow and black colour scheme.<br /><br />The CD itself has a great grey and black version of the black and yellow caution stripes,and tones down the vibrant inside of the case. The lyric pamphlet/inner insert is extremely well designed. It's pleasant to look at, the lyrics are in a kicking font that's creative but still easy to read, and the photos are stunning and wonderfully represent the songs that are put on each page. The wardrobe department went all out and went fierce on the outfits for this album, and the photographers did a wonderful job too. I find myself paging through the insert everytime I pull this CD out.<br /><br />I could not be more happy with this CD, it has become an instant favourite of mine and officially hooked me on Adam Lambert.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Most of coworkers and friends have been talking nonstop about this series.  I finally broke down, after saying I'd never read it, and was surprised that I loved the series.  Some aspects made me roll my eyes, like the internal monologue Ana repeats throughout the books.  Now I'm excited for the movies and have the perfect Christian Grey in my mind... Matt Bomer!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I couldn't put this book down as soon as I started it!  McDougall's account about the Tarahumara is anything but boring.  It's not just about the race but more about the whole anatomy and our set (and wrong) philosophy on running.  He runs through a whole gamut of research on why our current method of running is wrong and the Tarahumara have it right.  I found his narrative very insightful and mind-blowing (especially the part about our shoes!).  Can't wait to go out for a real run now!  Fyi:  i'm a beginner runner so this book, as a lot of other reviews pointed out, may not be as resourceful or new insight for advanced runners.  However, i think for any level runner, the sheer joy that the characters in the book have for running may be inspirational and moving.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not think the wit was particular sharp or otherwise.<br />The chapters went on and on.  Subject matter could have been<br />stated in a few sentence and did not need to be repeated over and<br />over.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is an awesome game that you can take any where.it has challenging levels and not so challenging levels.I think its great for all ages.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|Enjoyed season three, Jensen has his character Deansown down pat. Great action wirh a good amount of storyline. May have too much blood spatter for younger audiences.audiences.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is really fun to play. except it goes black and I have to force close. If you are looking for a free and fun word game get scramble with friends and challenge me to a game. My username is iheartbacon123. :-)
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought the first book and somehow it downloaded all three.  I started the first book and hated it!<br />it has no story and just sex.  now I paid for all three books and it was a total waste of money.  my fault for not previewing it and reading other reviews.  I learned my lesson!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|sounds are natural and calming. great variety and I love the option to blend your favorite sounds. music plays even when screen is off and timer is useful when going to sleep.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|nothing special a bunch of off brand games to pass time. great for travel and just something to do. some games require more coins then I feel it should take but otherwise pretty cool
0553801473|2.0|Its clear now after Feast and Dancing either Martin, the publisher, or both want to milk this for all its worth and there is no plan to conclude the saga. Yet again, as in FFC this one has no plots resolved and too many new characters. I remember when this was supposed to be a three book series. I wish it had stayed that way. I will buy the next book but I will buy a used version because the series is no longer worth $10.
B008BM9L72|5.0|not sure they can make this for tv. they would have to cut most of the content lol. dont know who they would cast in it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|That, my friends, was a total roller coaster. \\"Plot twists\\" doesn't even begin to describe this book. I had no clue who to peg as the bad guy and I had no clue how I wanted the book to end. I'm a total root for the underdog type of girl, and I've never been so unsure of who that underdog was. The book starts out one way - typical murder mystery style - and then WABAM it totallly changes course. And then WABAM...WABAM...WABAM...I think there were about four major plot twists through the course of the book and it was so unnerving (but really really ridiculously exciting)!<br /><br />I had a strange sense after reading just the first page of this book that I was really going to like it. I clicked with the writing style right away, and found myself relating to the characters almost immediately. I think Flynn digs into the characters so much more than in the typical thriller, which allowed for a deeper understanding of the nuances behind all those plot twists.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a little dissatisfied right after I finished Gone Girl. It just wasn't exactly the ending that I was hoping for. But now after letting it sit for a bit, I think I felt this way because throughout the book I kept flip-flopping on what ending I wanted. Because of this, I was never going to fully get my way (I have now come to terms with this and am feeling better about things). It's definitely worth the read - just prepared to be thrown for a few loop-de-loops.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A Great End to a Great Series!I really enjoyed this book and hope the author decides to write another series.
1907563202|3.0|Nice crochet ideas but just for begginers! All ideas very simple! I love de colours and suggestions. Easy to follow and Lovely pictures!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Unfortunately, I switched phones same time servers went down. I have read this garbage is pretty common.<br />If you are going to charge for something it needs to work.<br />I'll be uninstalling and going with something else.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This may be the worst piece of writing ever! After the novelty of the first sex scene is gone, all that is left is an annoying, repetitive waste of time. I could not read past the half way point. Why is there two more books?! My &#34;inner goddess&#34; is wishing she could have her money back.
B007SGM084|3.0|I first heard of these books on facebook. I didn't think to ask about subject matter. It was a quick and exciting read. There is a lot more sexuality in this book than I expected. Yet, I couldn't put it down. I think the author  was right on the money writing the first three books from a female point of view, then in the last book, the author gave us a taste of what the Next trilogy will be from the male perspective. I will probably buy those books also. What a marketing stratagie!
B00846REIS|4.0|This is a lusty romance novel. Unless you have ever felt that type of fire, one may not understand the primal draw to someone who is broken on the inside. It's when there are two people who have underlying issues that relationships become complicated. This book is full of complicated relationships. It was a fast read and ejoyable.
0345803485|5.0|Every couple should buy this book.  I couldn't put it down.  And while I'm waiting for book #2, I find myself reading this book for a second time.  I am fascinated with Christian grey and Ana's hot, steamy, sexy yet complicated relationship.  If you are thinking of buying the book, go ahead and buy it now, it is with your money.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a blast! Even though it is so addicting you finish through all the levels fast, it is great fun for replay too. Can't wait for new levels and achievements!
B005VPRET4|5.0|As a mom of two boys we have more LEGOs in this house than I can count, and I've nearly stepped on more than my feet can take. When I saw these new \\"Friends\\" sets at the LEGO store I was immediately fascinated. Girl LEGOS! I mean really, who cares, boys can play with them and girls can play with the other LEGOs...but still. My inner child kicked in and I was in love. Apparently it was totally obvious, so my husband and boys got me this set as a gift.<br /><br />It's just adorable, and I love the accessories. A cute little mixer, bowls...the pastries are darling! It was relaxing, if not cathartic, to put it together while the boys were napping. Then when they woke up LEGO Batman and Catwoman had a chase scene through the Cafe while Indiana Jones sat down for a cupcake and a beverage. Love it. ;-)
8866131385|4.0|I usually like Moleskine stuff, and this fits right in. It the right size to fit comfortably in a bag or brief, has plenty of room for entering information but not a lot of category areas that never get used, and the accompanying notes. Being a teacher the 18 month coverage is a big plus. It has month overviews as well as weekly details. The cover is soft and pliable while still protecting the book. It has calendars for 2012, 2013, and 2014. There is international information on time zones, flight times, size and measurement conversions, and there is a half dozen extra note pages in the back as well as a folder for cards, loose sheets, and the like. 4 stars for 2 reasons: the December page was miscut and crinkled (quality control), and the international holiday pages only give dates of holidays, not what the holiday is!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|When I first read reviews for this book I was hesitant to buy it. After having a friend of mine read it and love it I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />I loved the book. I felt that it was a page turner that kept you wanting more. It certainly is not a light hearted read. It is set during the time of slavery on a plantation so naturally the author addresses some sad, but very realistic issues that the people of that time faced.<br />I felt like the author did a great job developing the main characters. I too enjoyed how she developed other characters so thoroughly through the two main characters.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not sure about on the book was the ending. It was not bad, but it was not what I, in my mind had hoped it would be.<br /><br />Over all a really great book!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun but challenging game with my favorite platypus... Perry! It also has funny comments and unlockables - I really enjoy what Dr. Doofenschmirtz has to say! :) This is DEFINATELY worth the preis, &amp; I hope more levels come later! (it's got multilingual support for Deutsch, Dutch, Spanish etc.)
B007SGM084|5.0|This trillogy was exceptional.  I didn't want to put it down!  This is not my typical choice (I'm more murder/mystery) so I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it, but I am very glad I did.  The books kept me intrigued and wanting more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Played it for a few days and loved it! Fun and entertaining! Great for car rides! When I started it was a little boring then BOOM it was all awesome and stuff
0385340540|4.0|He might have pled guilty, but that doesn't mean he was.<br /><br />Okay, so why would an innocent man plead guilty if he wasn't? That's what The Broker is about. There are a very few auto-buy authors for me. John Grisham is one of those authors. Once I sit down to read one of his books, I'm there for the long haul. I never know what will happen next and can't wait to find out how it happens.<br /><br />Joel Backman did a lot of bad things. He brokered deals, moved money, oh and he had these disks. What are on those disks? That's what everyone wants to know. Joel managed to get his hands on a satellite system, but he refused to give it up fast. So the government intervened. Someone will off the man who has the secrets, right?<br /><br />I knew going in this would be a tale full of twists and turns. I wasn't let down. There were times when I thought I had this story figured out and I was totally off. I love that in a book. I also got really involved in the story. I wanted to make sure that certain secondary characters were treated with dignity, and made it out alive. I can't say what all happened, but I am one satisfied reader. Joel might have done those bad things. He might have swindled some money and made promises no one can keep, but his evolution through the book made me root for him. I wanted to see him get his happily ever after. I thought about him and the secondary characters long after I had to put the book down - because I fell asleep. I wanted to keep reading but my eyes didn't cooperate. That's a great thing.<br /><br />If you want a book that's got twists, turns and a plot you won't forget, then this might be the book for you!<br /><br />Originally posted at LAS Mystery Reviews
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun to play and easy to play great way to pass the time . as much fun as the first game.
0061692042|2.0|I listened to this book because it was given to me by my son.  I love to read and I love Canada.  So my Son thought this would be a perfect book for my long commutes.  At first I thought this is interesting.  Two twins growing up moving around with two very different parents.  Then it went on and on as to why his somewhat different parents took a different path in life.  He tried over and over to explain why two such people would rob a bank.  Then there is way too much detail about every feeling the young man had.  I think the sex with his twin put me over the top.  The whole story had no meaning and was just about a very messed up family that never got better.  There are so many wonderful novels about tough lives such as \\"The Glass Castle\\", \\"Blackbird\\".  This is just so slow and boring that you will want the hours you wasted reading it back.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|The title of this motion picture is taken from the popular hymn Amazing Grace which was written by John Newton. In this film, Albert Finney plays the former slave trader who once carried slaves across the sea. After turning from the slave trade, he became a minister in Britain. William Wilburforce grew up in his congregation and became a member of the British Parliament where he would contend for the abolition of slavery for 20 years.<br /><br />The film Amazing Grace is based on a true story and was released on the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Britain. The movie depicts the passion and diligence of those who sought freedom and an end to injustice for those who could not speak for themselves. Albert Finney portrays a humbled man who is haunted by the 20,000 human souls that he harmed.<br /><br />The movie also has a touch of romance for Wilburforce. His friends try their hand at matchmaking and introduce him to a pretty redhead who is also an abolitionist. In spite of their initial resistance to the idea, the two find common ground and marry. The movie switches back and forth from different times in the life of Wilburforce, from youth to when he is older, which can get a little confusing at times. On a historical note, the close friend of Wilburforce, William Pitt, still holds the record as being the youngest Prime Minister in Britain's history. Among the dvd extra features is a music video by Chris Tomlin singing his rendition of Amazing Grace inspired by the motion picture.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun. keeps you busy. lots to choose from but its going slow cause I don't want to spend real money
B00338QENI|5.0|This is the kind of book that you can't stop talking about after you read it.  You want all of your friends to read it too so you can discuss it at length.  It could easily have been a snore of a read if not for the author's ability to make the science part understandable and interesting.  She was also adept at inserting information about the Lacks family and her relationships with them which truly gave the book a human face.
B002RI9BH6|1.0|Boring book with endless sentences and paragraphs making it difficult to read. I tried reading it but somehow could not get beyond the third page
B001HNE3NO|5.0|So many times in our lives, situations that we can't predict occur and change our lives forever.  This story tells of a particular situation that changed a little girl and affected every aspect of her life from that moment on.  We see the effect that war has on people who are trying to live their lives peacefully, and who have no say in what government does.  Tatiana told an amazing story, I could not put the book down.
0345803507|5.0|I loved the 50 shades Freed, it was a great continuation of the 50 shades trilogy.  I couldn't put the book down.  Took me 2 days to finish the book, every chance i got i read a chapter.  If given the chance i will reread the books.  What a great new author.

0375842209|4.0|The book is about a young girl, Liesl (like in The Sound of Music!) who is an 'orphan' of the war. Her mother no longer being able to care for the two children, Liesl and her brother, places them into the foster care system of Nazi Germany. On the train trip to the fostering agency, Liesl's little brother dies. He's buried quickly and as the grave diggers walk away from the site, Liesl sees the book, and she takes it as a reminder of this time in her life. So it begins.<br /><br />Not the most literary piece of work, I did enjoy this story. It was well thought-out and descriptive, and I felt like I knew all of the characters. Not having read many books set in this time period, I felt it did a decent job of portraying the times and the attitudes of the people. Some of them were sold out to the man and the system; some, as Liesl's foster family, were not.<br /><br />See my full review:<br />[...]

B001LRJH0U|4.0|I read Robert Parker's book and of course it does a better job of bringing out the characters more, but even so this Western was a good film.  Virgil and Everett are these two wild west versions of soldiers of fortune who seek out bad guys and enforce the law in out of control places, one of these being the town of Appaloosa.  There is this rancher named Bragg, played very convincingly by Jeremy Irons, who is an unlawful unabiding citizen, terrorizing everyone, refusing to pay for drinks and goods, and destroying anyone who stands in his way including the sheriff, deputies, even though one of his hired hands has committed a murder.  There is no stopping this guy until Virgil(Harris) and Everett(Mortenson) arrive in town and then the body count goes up as these two prove to the bad guys that they mean what they say:  We'll kill you if you don't obey the law!  A diversion also shows up in the name of Allison(Zellweger), a widowed woman with a questionable past, who becomes the main love interest of Virgil.  She is also a survivor and will do almost anything to stay alive which causes some consternation for Virgil.  Like all Westerns the good guys come out on top and I have to say this one was kind of refreshing because there was some humor in it as well.

0142429112|5.0|I love this story! The book was a little hard to read because of all the different languages and the upper level of intelligence and wit, but the audio book was perfect for me to follow and I really enjoyed it. The main character is a historian, so of course it gives you some history as well as a little danger and romance mixed in. Listened to both books in a week and can't wait for the third!
B007MU85D0|4.0|It's easy to call the music on this album fun. It is fun! It gets you grooving along with it pretty easily, but without sacrificing musical complexity like more popular bands. There is a good amount going on given the pace of the album, and it will take a couple listens to appreciate all of it, though just one time through will have you humming tunes on and off and trying to remember where they came from.<br /><br />That said, it's not without flaws. The band shouting \\"Hey!\\" that helps generate excitement at first does get slightly overused around the middle, and starts to edge on the side of grating. Some of the chords do start to feel repetitious.<br /><br />It's still a fun and mostly clever album with a lot of music on board. For only $5, I recommend it to just about anyone.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|the things it has to edit with are great. and if you have a kindle fire it works great to edit pictures from facebook and stuff like that.

1606995359|5.0|After buying 'Lost In The Andes' on a whim, I am completely hooked on Fantagraphics' collection of Barks' work. 'Only A Poor Old Man' holds up to the same high standards of printing, coloring, and binding that 'Andes' has and really makes this the definitive collection. The coloring is amazing on full-sized pages that make it feel that much more true to source. Plus the material itself is sandwiched with some great essays. This volume beginning with none other than George Lucas is a great welcome and then followed up by some more scholarly looks at each individual story presented afterwards makes for some interesting reading after you've finished these adventure tales.<br /><br />This is, of course, to say nothing of the material. For me, personally, Barks has gone from little-known to idolized as his stories and illustrations are just as relevant and exciting as they were when they were first published. Unfortunately I missed out the first time around as having not been born yet is an inconvenience. Many thanks to Fantagraphics for making these wonderful comics available again and at such a high production value.<br /><br />This collection comes **highly recommended.**
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Approached as an allegory, the characterizations work very well, particularly once you read all three volumes. In this first book, Gale correctly identifies the enemy as the Capitol and nurtures an ideological hatred for it. Peeta hopes that he will not loose himself in the arena; somehow find a way to defy the Capitol's power over his spirit. More than that, he pledges to protect Katniss because of his love for her, something he had done since that day his mother beat him for singeing those loaves of bread long ago. And Katniss? She must find where her self lies between the two poles.<br /><br />The second volume (no worries, this is not a spoiler) makes mention of *panem et circenses* (bread and circuses), a political strategy described by Juvenal to the Rome of his time that emperors used as a means for to appease the population; the parallels between Katniss's world and Juvenal's are inescapable, but the modern parallel may be closer to home than one might think.<br /><br />A great book for discussing allegory, foreshadowing, and recurring themes with older children. Hunt for symbols and their meaning. Yes, the mockingjay is hard to miss. The characters themselves represent certain ideals that are wonderful starting places for discussions. Beyond the tools of storytelling, there are questions the author explores about personhood; the proper exercise of citizenship; sacrifice; surrender to our baser instincts and yes, transcendence from it.<br /><br />At least read the first two books before launching into discussions. If you can, I highly recommend reading all three, and then talking some more!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|i loved this book second best book I've ever read i would give this book a 4 & a half. if you liked the hunger games series i would DEFINITELY recommend  the witch and wizard series i would give those books a five star rating if you like action suspense murder and romance i would definitely recommend this series
0345803507|5.0|Oh, Fifty Shades...I fell in love with this series reading the first book in the trilogy, and this last installment was all I wished for and more! To me, this book ends the series just the way I wanted it to happen. Usually, when reading a series, the ending can leave you feeling like the author forgot someone or something along the way, not with this series. I was so impressed with the ending, it left me feeling like the characters would have a happy, long life together. I would recommend this series to any woman who needs a little excitement in her life! I promise that you will be happy you took a chance and read this series!! I look forward to new titles from this author!!
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X is a progressive/power metal band that has been around since the mid-90s.  They are kind of in the realm of Dream Theater but are more intense and IMHO better sounding.  \\"The Odyssey\\" is their sixth album and in this album they slightly leave their more progressive origins and develop a heavier crunchier sound.  I'm not saying they completely left their progressive origins at there is still much complexity to the music to enjoy.  Musically they are one of the most talented bands I know.  The guitar player can shred at times but mixes it up well with slower mixed with the faster leads.  The drummer plays heavy, but with interesting off-beats that are fairly complicated.  The vocals at times are more gruff along the lines of Pantera and Avenged Sevenfold, however, Russell Allen, also can hit the higher notes of Queensryche and Iron Maiden.  This album is simply amazing.  Highlights in this album would include the first track \\"Inferno (Unleash the Fire) which pulls off the crunchy heavy sound with a melodic chorus, which can also be said with \\"King of Terror.\\"  Then there is \\"Accolade II\\" which is more keyboard and melody oriented.  The album ends with the title track which is over 24 minutes of complexity and tells the story of Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" in a song.  Symphony X is one of those bands who can show of their talent while writing good sounding music.    [...]

B000063DFQ|5.0|Iron Maiden - \\"Piece of Mind\\" (1983) - \\"Piece of Mind\\" is Iron Maiden's fourth full length album and first album to introduce drummer Nicko Mcbrain.  In fact, all the members of Iron Maiden that played in the band when this album was recorded are currently playing in the band.  The album is similar to \\"The Number of The Beast\\" yet a little more progressive in nature.  Many of the band's well known tracks are on here such as \\"Revelation,\\" \\"Flight of Icarus,\\" \\"Die With Your Boots On,\\" and \\"The Trooper.\\"  After releasing \\"The Number of the Beast\\" some religious fanatics accused Iron Maiden of Satan worship, which of course, is bogus.  Well, in between \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Still Life\\" there is a backwards message in response to these accusations telling people not to meddle with things they don't understand with a nice loud belch after it (or before, depending on how you look at it).  The lesser-known songs on this album aren't just fillers, they are also well written and put together songs.  Bruce Dickinson shows off his vocal range in this album on songs like \\"Quest For Fire.\\"  \\"Revelation\\" is probably my favorite song off this album as there are many changes in it from light to heavy.  One thing I like about Iron Maiden is they write songs with a story to tell and this album is no exception.  There are songs based on mythology, history, war, and so on.  I like the message from \\"Die With Your Boots On' which is basically saying no matter how much crap is going on, don't go down without a fight, at least that is my interpretation.  This is a must have for any fan of Maiden.<br /><br />[...]
B005Q1W0ZQ|1.0|Very disappointed overall.Bought one copy of 3 discs and was pleased with the first two discs except some episodes were out of sequence. The third disc would not play at all on my machine and came on my screen as only playable in Region A. Being in Australia that does not help.I returned the original 3 disc set and asked to have it replaced with a version that would work opn my machine explaining my problems with the original. The set was replaced and on trying to play the set again, found that this set of three discs was exactly the same. I have now asked for a refund. I will now wait till BBC produces a version that is compatible with Australia and purchase locally.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Amazing read, couldn't put the book down. A truly inspiring journey by one of the best ultra runners of our time. As a vegan, I took particular delight in the recipes, which thus far have not disappointed in the slightest.  You will become a sure Scott Nuremberg fan, and want to push yourself to your limits.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|I'm writing this on the North American release day. I bought it at my local record shop and I've listened to it twice already. This album immediately made me think \\"Passion and Warfare\\", only more matured and more Vai-ish. I was particularly surprised by John the Revelator/ The Book of Seven Seals. Check it out!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The first book was okay and had a great start.. that being said it ended up with me going.. okay.. when does this continue to be original..  it doesn't..  for those who want to be in the fantasy land of bdsm... and the perfect bdsm relationship..  keep on.. cause this is a stupid view of two people who have no life.. him.. yeah.. big man now!!  wants to save world.. still wants to punish world (women),  her.. sheesh I can't remember her name..  that is  how involved I was pulled into the story for them..  NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR TIME TO READ IT IF YOU GET IT FROM THE LIBRARY!  I started at the Library.. had my name on the list for xxxxx amount of time.. OMG!!  I am so glad I didn't buy this..<br />I would not spend money on these books they are not worth the money or the time to check them out in the library
B000AP04FG|2.0|Some spots of witty dialog save this movie.  But unless you enjoy fight movies with no attachment whatsoever to reality, this one will be hard to swallow.  Angelina's well known emaciation really shows here--- she looks as if she has muscle wastage, so it's hard to believe she could knock out legions of professional assassins in hand to hand combat.  The usual trailer-load of bodies is left behind but Brangelina, of course, are barely scratched.  The last fight sequence was 10 minutes of 20 men shooting at them with face to face semi-auto rapid fire, but Brangelina ducked, somersaulted, & spun effortlessly away from every bullet to sashay away into the sunset. It was so ridiculous what measured enjoyment I had from the beginning of the film was completely lost.  A weak plot and a slightly disturbing view of marriage all add up to a so-so rental.  I wanted escapist fantasy, but this was so absurd I felt the writers, producers and fight choreographers were just plain lazy.
0439023513|1.0|Terrible.<br /><br />Collins seems to want to make this book as depressing as possible with the war, torture, depressions, etc., and make us dislike all the characters as much as possible. Every single one. Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, Plutarch... the only one she makes more likeable is Finnick, who she offs in a quick random paragraph without any emotion attached to it.<br /><br />The second half of the book is their attempt to get to Snow, and it ends with Katniss blacked out unaware of the takeover.<br /><br />Katniss whole mission in the book is to kill Snow, and suddenly at the end she takes his advice and doesn't end up killing him.<br /><br />Gale and Katniss being best of friends then suddenly hating each other by the end of the third book....<br /><br />I don't buy that \\"she belongs with Peeta\\". Gale and Katniss relationship was forged by something real... years of suffering through the same conditions and looking out for one another and their families.... She didn't even know who Peeta was until the games started.. her \\"love\\" for him was born out of trauma and a feeling of \\"owing\\" him for saving her life so many times.... He loved her but I don't believe she loved him the same way... I think her feelings for Gale were stronger.<br /><br />Everything about this book was disappointing.... It should have ended with the second book, not actually having a quarter quell, but the quell participants leading the rebellion.
B000025XKM|5.0|One of the greatest folk records out there. Not much else needs to be said. We lost a genius to an overdose. Not really appreciated in his time but this record will stand forever as long as it is available to listen to. The stark and fluid guitar work is contrasted with a voice so soothing, so troubled, and so damning of the culture around it. I can't really say much more. This record is an outstanding piece from one of our greatest musicians. The remastered tracks sound every bit as good as they should. Perfection.

0142419400|3.0|3.5 stars. I can't quite give it 4.<br /><br />For quite some time I've been reading so much YA paranormal and other similar stuff, but for about a week I've been on a kick reading realistic contemporary romance - both YA and \\"New Adult\\" (aka college age).  This book is one of about ten that I bought a few days ago and have been tearing through.  I liked it, but didn't love it.<br /><br />Anna was awesome.  She was a funny, smart, flawed heroine that was really well written and made me root for her.  There was a lot of growth for her throughout the book and I think the best part of it was reading about her finding herself and growing up.<br /><br />St. Clair/Etienne was just kind of okay for me.  I really liked his interactions with Anna, and I think my favorite part was the Thanksgiving holiday they spent together.  I fell a little for both of them during that part of the novel.  I didn't like how long he dragged out his relationship with Ellie, it bugged me a lot.  The author also harped on his short size, which was unattractive to me (I realize that's superficial and shallow, but it's the truth).<br /><br />Most of the relationship stuff with Anna and St. Clair was really cute and I spent a lot of time smiling throughout the book.  The secondary characters were decent, though I didn't really find myself caring too much about what happened to them.  I do like that all of the teenagers were realistic in how they acted, instead of over the top like many authors portray them.<br /><br />Definitely a fun and fluffy read and I definitely plan on reading more by this author.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|beautiful and amazing game. multiplayer is awesome. and the game is free. do not hesitate about getting this game. you shouldn't even finish the review if you haven't got it yet
0143034901|3.0|What can I possibly add that 900 reviews before me has not touched upon? I do not agree with the extremes of the reviews- those who considered the book a phenomenon, or, on the other side, a total flop. I think this is a good story written with a beautiful language, but needs a few tweaking in plot execution.  Revelation of a major plot by a letter, from multiple perspective is a huge flaw.  Not doing your homework (wether in initial language or translation), calling an arthropod an insect, is pure negligence.  Miss-spelling of a famous pen Meisterst&uuml;ck (master piece) into Meinsterst&uuml;ck is REALLY embarrassing.  And in the end, the polar characterizations of people makes it, how shall we put it, teenager like?  I would have personally liked a little less open banality, a bit more culture and depth.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|I love this game!! would be five star but when playing on any android device there is no multiplayer .. I'm so jealous of my friends who play against each other on their iPhone's ... super lame to exclude all us android users .. common noodlecake studios
B0084RSYEK|4.0|I think a lot of other reviewers have hit the nail on the head. This movie has a lot of potential. It's got some humor, as well as some surprisingly heartwarming moments. Eddie Murphy is past his prime, but he still manages to give enough to make the touching scenes work. The conclusion is as surprising as it is useful to remember.<br /><br />However, the final product is a 3.5 star film rather than a 5 star one. The humor sometimes just doesn't work. Much of it is Eddie Murphy going over the top, which doesn't really work as well when you're trying to combine humor with a heartwarming story. However, what really undermines the film is that too often too many of the characters make ridiculously stupid choices. If you really only had 1,000 words left to speak before you die, wouldn't you use a few of those words to immediately tell your wife what's going on? Wouldn't you call in sick for work? The whole plot seems poised to put Eddie Murphy into silly situations, but with a bit more creativity the scriptwriters could have written a more compelling and believable story.
B007SGM084|4.0|I just finished the trilogy. I have to say the books were more addictive then I thought, although I had read reviews before staring. I started with the sample of the first book. I wasn't going to pay such high price and then find out it's a piece of crap. I was hooked on the first chapters and the sample is long enough to get you going and make you wonder what happens next.<br /><br />Some clichés do exist, but it's essentially a love story, and I guess they're a little hard to avoid. Though I was pleasantly surprised at this trilogy, and absolutely loved it. They're by far the best chick books I've read, and I'm not much of a romance enthusiast. In fact, when it comes to romance books my opinion is you've read one, you've read them all. These were a very pleasant change of pace, and like I said, very addictive.<br /><br />In fact, that's why I give the books only 4 stars: they're so addictive that you can't stop reading them, and in the end you find yourself spending $30 for the electronic version. Aand as an editor, I don't think the books are all that well edited. I found at least 10 typos in each book; small stuff, nothing major, but when you pay this much for a book, you're kind of disappointed when you find they didn't do a good job on editing it.<br /><br />I hope the publisher will take that into account on future books and make them a little more accessible to the public.

B005LAIGF0|2.0|This unduly long film is sufficiently amorphous and thematically uncertain that it lends itself to a variety of interpretations.  I suspect that whoever edited it was as confused as I was as to what was going on and why some of the characters were inserted.  Yes, life is complex and defies easy summary in the form of a convenient narrative, but this movie takes off in too many directions with too little coherence to make it honestly interpretable as a cinematic whole.  Maybe if I had read Gerard Manley Hopkins' poem \\"Margaret\\" immediately before viewing this DVD by the same name I would have had a ready-made point of departure for making sense of some of it, but that really shouldn't be necessary.  \\"Margaret\\" the film should speak for itself a lot more clearly than it does.<br /><br />Coming of age is painful, episodic, fraught with fits and starts, nonlinear, and unpredictable.  Sometimes it takes an horrific turn, assuring an unnaturally difficult maturation process, as with Lisa, \\"Margaret's\\" main character.  It seemed to me, however, that Lisa was never so willfully oblivious and callow that she needed this sort of brutally painful shock to jump-start her movement toward maturity.  She may have been a bit self-absorbed and arrogant, but her biography as we knew it seemed to assure that she had experienced her share of bumps, bruises, indifference, disappointment, and betrayal, and that a more privileged and insulated protagonist would have better filled her role.  Yes, she lived an upper middle class life in an upper middle class world, but whatever smugness she had left could have been remedied with something less destructive than post-traumatic stress disorder.  No, there are no guarantees that we'll get what we need and deserve, or what seems fitting, but scars inflicted on smooth skin seem more telling for the viewer than scars inflicted on scars.  Too much of the latter and we don't come of age, we simply fail to thrive at all.<br /><br />Lisa's mother was portrayed very effectively by J. Cameron Smith, but she seemed as confused and unfinished as her daughter.  Lisa's father was a remote and determinedly ineffectual figure whose blandness made lack of affect seem like a dynamic phenomenon.  Her younger brother appeared on screen occasionally, but his character remained completely undeveloped, making one wonder why he was there.  Jean Reno's Colombian businessman, who courted Lisa's mother throughout most of the movie, seemed as inept and unconcerned as Lisa's father, making one wonder if her mother was somehow drawn to expressionless, self-centered bores.  Matt Damon and Matthew Broderick had thankless roles as more or less adequate teachers, though Broderick's inability to anticipate and handle out-of-the-ordinary student responses would puzzle anyone who has taught for even a few years -- it comes with the territory.  Jeannie Berlin does a great caricature of a middle-aged, single, Manhattan Jew with time on her hands.  New York is impersonal, drab, dirty, glitzy, cultured, cruel, and is given entirely too much cinematic attention.  We get it!  Enough!<br /><br />Lisa is confused, disappointed, frustrated, seductive, guilt-ridden, naive, spoiled, an easy mark, awkward, attractive, obsessive, annoying, angry, troubled, destructive, and, I suppose, working toward adulthood.  Most people are most or all of these things at one time or another over the course of a lifetime.  But all in one film?  Anna Paquin is undeniably talented and does the best she can, but it's an awful lot to ask of one actor in one movie, especially when the script dictates a startlingly ambiguous and lame ending, one that suggests the author finally ran out of steam but made sure to do so in an obscure and pretentious fashion.<br /><br />Life is hard.  It takes an act of bad faith to represent that fact in an histrionic, overwrought, idiosyncratically artsy and artificial way.

0439023521|3.0|I was given The Hunger Games for my birthday a couple of months ago and made it a priority read, even though I have over a dozen books on my shelf that have been calling out my name to be read for over a year now. Now that the Hunger Game series is complete, a movie has been made, and the store shelves are complete with merchandise, I figured I'd finally get on the bandwagon and check what all the hype is about.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, I was avoiding The Hunger Games for a couple of different reasons. One being the issue of my reading backlist. The other being that the plot sounded too much like Battle Royale. As clunky as some of the writing was, Battle Royale was a great novel. You can check out my review for it here. But when The Hunger Games came around, I figured it was just a copycat of Battle Royale and decided to avoid it like I do so much other uninspired fiction and entertainment.<br /><br />When I finally finished The Hunger Games (I'm referring to Book 1 in this review), I realized that there were enough differences in character, plot, and writing style to call The Hunger Games somewhat original when compared to Battle Royale. However, I won't say I was enamored with the book overall.<br /><br />The Hunger Games opens with a great character voice, that of Katniss Everdeen. One major thing that keeps The Hunger Games apart from Battle Royale is that Battle Royale was written from many different points of view and The Hunger Games focuses on one specific character, her story told in 1st-person. It works well for the book and does a great job getting me to invest in the character.<br /><br />The plot of The Hunger Games is believable and tragic. You understand from the very beginning what the conflict in the story is and the seemingly impossible odds the characters in the book have to face in order to live day to day. I especially loved the parts about the hunting that goes on past the fence surrounding District 12 and the loyalties that the residents of the district have to each other as opposed to the Capitol. It gave a sense of hope in mankind and shed light on the aspect of community.<br /><br />The book progresses along pretty smoothly. I enjoy Collins's writing style. Never once did I have to stop and reread a passage to figure out what the author was trying to say. That's important to me as a reader, because I have so many books I want to read, I really don't want to be wasting my time having to reread stuff I've already read just to understand what the characters are doing or where they are in the story. I have trouble with this sometimes in some of Stephen King's work. As much as I love his Dark Tower series, there are many times I have to reread passages to figure out what the heck is going on or what King is trying to say. Most of that is probably due to the fact that he has so much exposition in his novels. Collins does a good job balancing exposition with action to keep the reader moving along.<br /><br />The world of The Hunger Games didn't feel filled out. In Battle Royale, the characters question the government, their world, others around them. In The Hunger Games, it seems to be well-accepted that children will be thrown into an arena to kill each other at some point in their adolescence. The parents of these children don't seem as broken up over this as I would expect them to be. Maybe if the world was ALWAYS like this from the time of its creation, I could believe it, but the book clearly explains that things were not always like this. I've heard that a rebellion begins in the second book in the series, but it felt strange that it didn't start in this one.<br /><br />When I read Battle Royale, it took hundreds of pages to get through the 42 contestants. It seems by the time I got about halfway through The Hunger Games, there are only a handful of participants left alive. And herein lies one of my gripes. The killings felt a little evasive - in regards to the author's willingness to tell/show us what happened. I'm not asking for gratuitous violence - especially since this is a `young adult' book - but I yearned for a little more description as to what happened to the other characters. Some seemed to just vanish into thin air, with no real details of how they died.<br /><br />Battle Royale was also a bit more gruesome than The Hunger Games, as well as more psychologically rife. That's one thing I didn't find realistic about The Hunger Games. It seems some of the characters do in fact question the morals associated with killing one another, but they seem way more concerned with their own well-being than allowing a corrupt government establishment to turn them into murderers. Katniss barely questions killing anyone during her time in the arena. When she does finally make her first kill - intentional or not - she stops for a few seconds to ponder it and then she is off again on her adventure. I completely understand that one doesn't have much time to get philosophical when in a bloodbath arena dueling others who want to kill you, but still. She seems to carry little to no remorse, and I find that to be somewhat disturbing in a novel aimed at such a young audience.<br /><br />One thing that I did not like about the book was the ending.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />Throughout the whole book, I was anticipating Katniss to rebel against the Capitol. In fact, I told myself that if it didn't happen, and if she just went along with the rules of the game and came out the winner simply due to the fact that she killed the rest of the participants, that I would hate the book. I mean, what purpose would the book even have if it just stood to chronicle a mass of kids killing each other for the amusement of a sick and twisted government?<br /><br />First, I felt surprised, shocked, and somewhat confused when the wolves came into the arena. You know, the ones who are actually mutated versions of the other contestants of the Hunger Games. That was weird, felt a little out of place, and was never explained. Granted though, there are more books in the series, so I guess it's kind of okay that this was left somewhat open ended. But it felt random.<br /><br />Hope was instilled in me when Katniss and Peeta decide to rebel against the rules of the Game stating there could only be one winner after the rule was changed earlier to include two winners. It came as no surprise to me that the Capitol went back on the rules - they want entertainment, and I knew pitting two victors from the same district against each other would satisfy that need for an entertaining fight. When Katniss and Peeta decided to feign taking the poison berries so that the Capitol would have no victors, I was glad for the welcome story twist.<br /><br />From that point on, it felt as if there was another climax that was building up. There were still a few chapters left in the book, and I had hope that Katniss would rebel against the Games and start a riot or something and that would open up the door for the second book in the series. Maybe the wolf creatures would be explained. At least, that's what I thought might happen. Instead, for a couple of chapters, the author builds up this crazy tension and anticipation. Katniss is filled with paranoia about what the Capitol is going to do to her and Peeta since they rebelled with the berries. So while the Capitol is putting on a show of crowning Katniss and Peeta as victors, you're left waiting with bated breath as to what the Capitol really has up its sleeve. I mean, these two kids just pulled the government's punk card. Surely there will be retribution.<br /><br />I literally find myself on the edge of my seat as I rip through these last chapters, waiting for something great to happen, something to fulfill my desire for an uprising against this travesty of a government. I mean, we're talking about twelve districts against a corrupt government. And yet, there isn't much mention - if any (I don't remember) - of anyone even attempting to create a rebellion of any sort, at least not since the Hunger Games have started. (The whole reason for the Hunger Games is because there was a failed rebellion attempt years earlier.)<br /><br />Instead, I'm left with a lackluster ending that seemed to be built not around the Games themselves really, but around the theme of romance and betrayal. Peeta realizes that some of Katniss's affection towards him was contrived. I'm not sure why he would be so surprised, seeing how he was playing up that angle in the very beginning. But at the end of the book, he seems truly hurt and offended that Katniss would do such a thing to him. And for some reason, Katniss suddenly has mixed feelings about Peeta. I can believe that part to a certain extent because it would be natural for her to feel close to Peeta in the arena when he was the only one she could really trust. But her feelings seem to take a violent swing toward the other end of the spectrum as she rides that last train home, and it doesn't sit in my mind as all that believable.<br /><br />I am debating on picking up the second book in this series. Some have told me it's better than the first book, but I don't know. Overall, The Hunger Games was a decent read, but it's another one of those books that makes me scratch my head and ponder why in the world it gained so much buzz - enough to be made into a movie and eventually grow into a worldwide phenomenon.<br /><br />To sum it up, the book was okay. Surely not the phenomenon everyone has been raving about. It entertained me, had a lackluster and anti-climactic ending, and probably could have used a bit more filling to make the pie sweeter.a little out of place, and was never explained.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I appreciate a well-written, character-driven story and was excited about this one based on the accolades.  It started okay, but I wondered a little about those who wrote all the glowing reviews.  I wanted to keep an open mind and give it the benefit of the doubt,but the more the characters developed, the more I hated them.  Not just the two main characters, pretty much all of them.  I kept waiting for something to redeem them and it just got worse.  The ending left me with a sick, disturbed feeling in my gut. I wish I'd passed on this one.

Promethus, on the other hand, was great.  I just saw it for the second time.  The thing about the Alien films is that all have a different director with Alien Resurrection being the worst -and one of the worst of all time.  This is directed by Riply who directed the first Alien.  I am going to buy this film when the price comes down.

The most challenging factor that I've encountered so far is that it's difficult to maintain pressure in two directions (inward for the cutter and circular around the bottle) and also maintain an straight line along the outside of the bottle.<br /><br />Had I not dropped twenty bucks on this, I would probably try one of the table-resting devices where you simply rotate the bottle and let gravity worry about the keeping the bottle in contact with the cutter.

145210655X|4.0|This is a great book. Lots of inside jokes for Star Wars fans. I have a son named Luke so we get a kick out of it. Good artwork, funny cartoons. Worth the price, which isn't that bad.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I got this after listening to a few clips online. Rebecca's voice is soulful, sultry and soothing. The sound is fresh and similar to some music from the disco era, one example is the song:\\"Diamond to a Stone\\". Very retro, makes me think of Aretha. Stand out tracks are: Teach me how to be loved, Too Good to Lose, Mr. Bright Eyes, Fairytale, Fighting Suspicions, Glitter and Gold. The bonus track \\"Backtrack\\" is upbeat with a touch of whimsy, another favorite--make sure you check out the video on Youtube. Simply a great album! Nice to listen to on a drive, at the beach or just chilling. At 35 minutes, it seems to end too soon, and you find yourself doing a replay because it's that good!
1400169445|4.0|This is the first detective novel of the English language, written in 1868, and pre-dating Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes by more than 20 years.  It's an excellent mystery novel, and I found the writing to be surprisingly fresh.  The book is laced with humor including some hilarious tongue-in-cheek observations about religion and high-society.  Collins was a social liberal, portraying his female protagonist as  strong-willed, and poking-fun at the dusty, hypocritical moralizing of less enlightened folks.  It all still works more than 150 years after it was written.<br /><br />One thing that I found a little disappointing is that The Moonstone is not the sort of mystery that can be unraveled by the reader.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle peppered his stories of Sherlock Holmes with clues, thereby enabling the reader to match wits with the great detective.  In contrast, Wilkie Collins appears to have preferred to surprise his readers with plot twists, revealing in drops and dribbles new information that could not be guessed.  That makes this story less compelling than the stories of Sherlock Holmes, and I wonder if that's why it isn't as famous.<br /><br />Another thing that must be owned is that the book is quite long.  One reason for this is that there is a lot of character-development that isn't relevant to the story, but is included only because it's amusing.  That's a huge part of the charm of the book, but it does mean it sometimes gets bogged down within itself.  Regardless, it's worth a read.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I was so pleased because now there is a movie with alot of fight scenes but stll has a very good plot. The sex scenes are bountful.  I have watched Blood and Sand aleast 10 times.  I ordered the CD to listen the music in the car.

The sex scenes were ok, there was no great detail to them. She used the words hot, and down there a lot so it sounds was like the perspective of a young teenager. Overall i recommend it for a quick easy read, just dont expect to much.
B00846REIS|1.0|So I now know that if I would like to publish a book all I have to do is read a popular book, write exactly the same book and just change the names in it. This book is EXACTLY like 50 shades, I agree with the other reviewers who said they don't understand how this isn't considered plagiarism. The thing that makes me the most mad about it, is that the author is very clearly talented, she is an eloquent writer and has a way of making words flow that seems easy, it just would be nice if the book and story was actually hers, and not something that mostly everyone has already read. I really wish I had read the reviews before starting to read this, I'm extremely disappointed and offended by the fact that apparently no one cares that this is just fifty shades of grey copied.
B007AR7QQC|3.0|The 15 CD tribute box is *much* better. This has some very old recordings and the sound is often poor. Not just the recording, but the harpsichord itself. I also highly recommend his historic organ boxes. This though disappoints.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What a disappointment!. This book begins with good (meaning deprived) intentions, but rapidly goes downhill from there. The writing is juvenile and the plot slides from loose to  outright atrocious. The characters are hugely annoying as well as being totally unbelievable. The torture you so crave for Anastasia only manifests in the pain endured in searching for something interesting to happen throughout.<br /><br />This is not a book for women, this is a diary of a teenage twenty somethings wish list. It is however a great conversation point between women of a certain age and experience of how writing like this becomes a phenomenon.

One person said they didn't like all the adult humor??! I dont understand; what were you expecting when the poster is of hookers and Ted holding a bottle? Ur a knucklehead!  This movie was everything I expected it to be. I wasn't looking for a spielberg masterpiece; I was high and just wanted to laugh.  Comedy is all about oddities, and a talking bear who hits a bong and bangs a cashier is massively odd.  This movie had back to back jokes and I've made recommended it to many people who have loved it. It was funny, but I guarantee you wont laugh if your face was just buried Meryl Streep's  cinematic vagina!

030758836X|5.0|Literary whodunnit psychothriller. Flynn's Gone Girl is compelling, sharp, very well-written (slightly overwritten), very well executed, clever, caustic, showcases a great ear for dialogue. It's not perfect, but what is? Couldn't put it down. Don't listen to the haters and the criers over the untidy ending. As I insularly ask all haters: Can you even try writing something as captivating? Oh, you can't? Shocking. Highly Recommended.
159114325X|4.0|It is an impressive book, but whether it will thrill, interest or disappoint you will depend on your expectations.  The book is fully disclosed as the \\"Ultimate Photograph Album\\" so it is not a RA Burt, J Roberts, N Freidman or R Garkze technical work.  I was impressed & interested but struggled with the question \\"did I learned more about the ships.\\"  My conclusion was \\"no\\", but I came away knowing more about strategy and historical context from the relatively brief narratives.  The book has a high list price so you need to be delighted by it to own it.<br /><br />The book, as described, is 400+ pages of photos depicting a fleet a little more than a dozen ships (4 classes), a portion of which are Pre-Dreadnought WWI survivors.  It is in large format (commensurate w/ Photo Album style) and the print is also large.<br /><br />The photos are broad ranged: begining-to-end of ship service life, major events or appearances (and minor events), modifications, \\"action\\" shots, and lots of close ups.  The close-up photos do convey a sense of having visited the ships, and is superior in that respect.  Some blown-up and 2-page photos are a bit fuzzy.  For the post 1929 ships, there are also valuable line drawings (deck and side plans).  There is hardly any technical data, and when cited, tend to be embedded in the text:  \\"The XX ship made 28.4 knots at 48,502 bhp during trials on May 3, 1931.\\"<br /><br />I found the photos of the Pre-Dreadnought ships to be the most interesting because my book collection on WWI vessels is slim.  There is a series of photos of the High Seas Fleet scuttled at Scapa Flow and breakup work.  Again, I did find the WWI period photos interesting because I only have books that were available from 1980's and on, as interest in WWI events dissipated.<br /><br />The photos are accompanied by captions, but they tend to describe the event rather than the ships.  For example, there are abundant photos of ships in transit or at an event, and there is caption tonote some trivia, like, \\"the main crane has not be fitted yet after builder's trials.\\"  I didn't get a sense of the combat or service capabilities from reading the photo narrarives.<br /><br />The photos are presented in the order of the ships' launch/completion. Each class of vessels receives a general 1-2 pages of text, and each ship receives a \\"service history page\\".<br /><br />There is no technical narrative about performance,  However, I found the narrative interesting and informative (at least for me), in unexpected ways.  There are side notes on the individuals whom the ships were named after (Bismarch, von Tirpitz, etc.).<br /><br />The narrative provides an insight on Hiltler's thinking and how he personally drove the genesis of each vessel, providing contextual background on the design and purpose of each.  I did not know Hilter had given up on capital ships as effective weapons by 1943, explaining that the surviving capital ships \\"stood down\\" for the rest of the war.  The surface fleet was effectively neutralized by land & sea air power, just like in the Pacific.  The narrative explained the \\"Norway strategy\\" of docking ships there for safety and intended to harass convoys bound for Murmansk, which quite frankly was not previously understood by me.  The Norway strategy also had the intended or unintended effect of tying down considerable Royal Navy assets and RAF attention.<br /><br />Siegfried Breyer, one of 2 co-authors, died in 2010 and this was his last publication.  Breyer is one of the foremost experts on the WWII German Navy.  His \\"Battleships and Battlecruisers 1905-70\\" is a seminal work and he served as the cited editor of Weyer's Warships series.

B007KDFWRG|4.0|Rated this 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the truly bad packaging of the CD's. A trifold paper sleeve with a booklet pocketed in the middle panel. The 2 CD's fall out of the outer pockets very easily, and the first time I tried to gingerly slip the nearly inaccessible booklet out of its pocket, the spine of the sleeve ripped.<br /><br />This won't matter to MP3 people, but I'm old school - I like having tangible media and I like good audio fidelity.<br /><br />And I hold onto good albums for keeps, so I need this release to be able to hang in there for the long haul.<br /><br />So put this great music in a better package, please! The current sleeve design is doing nobody any favors.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I read all 5 books of this series and there is no comparison to \\"Lord of the Rings\\", as LOTR had a point. There is no comparison to this body of work and literature in general, because literature in general has a plot. There is no comparison to an EPIC anything because the protagonist(s) in an EPIC anything aren't killed off in order to end the book or to illustrate that all struggle is pointless because death is inevitable. Reading these books has been a monumental waste of my time.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I finished this book two weeks ago and I am still having impulses to immerse myself back into the world of Westeros and beyond.

B004GJDQT8|1.0|2 things to say about this and I'm done.<br /><br />1. I downloaded this app onto my phone even tho I live outside the US.  But for some reason the only things I could get access to were apps.  I thought that the apps were in ADDITION to getting access to my account on Amazon.com (which is why I downloaded it to begin with).  Why would I want to download ANOTHER app store when Google already has one on my phone?  Thank for the thought, Amazon. But I'm already covered.<br /><br />2. Is it just me, or didn't Amazon have an app where you could buy more than just apps on it a long time ago? Now that was a fantastic app.  It did the miraculous thing of giving me access to my account thru the app rather than having to use the internet.  But I can't find that app at all.  There's just THIS one left.  What fresh hell is this?<br /><br />If I seem over-dramatic, I'm sorry.  To me this app holds the same relevance/usefulness as the app to measure one's ugliness or the app that (I'm not kidding) is a Sims Stapler.  I don't understand it.  Etsy has a mobile app, Ebay has a mobile app.  Why doesn't Amazon? idgi.
0792844793|5.0|I've seen this movie years ago and again one other time. I decided to buy it and I am glad I did. Now this movie starts off like a good story of a nice neighbor hood but then it gets in to the dark side of things and it really turns. It really shows how sick some people are and tests what about me could I really be sick like that. If you can look at it and see what happens in the dark then you may want to watch it but if you like Mary Poppins type stuff this ain't for you.

B000025706|3.0|I own and am very familiar with box sets of the Mozart piano concerti by Brendel, Perahia, Uchida, Bilson and several others. This box set is not a tour de force.  It does not stand out as either a stylistic or interpretive breakthrough.  It is more of an occasionally illuminating exploration by musicians who don't seem to me to be at home with Mozart or even particularly familiar with him.  They appear to be feeling their way and occasionally \\"find\\" something or \\"do\\" something that is interesting.<br /><br />Also, I never thought I would find myself complaining about such things, but the microphone placement is off on this recording.  The orchestra often drowns out or obscures the soloist, so you can't always really tell what Schiff is doing without straining to separate the piano from the orchestra mentally.  It is pervasive and kind of annoying.<br /><br />I would only recommend this recording for those who might be familiar with Mozart's concerti and might be curious about how these particular performers handle them.  If you are only going to own one version of the complete Mozart piano concerti, this should probably not be it.  These concerti are inherently very beautiful and it is hard to obscure that fact.  However, they are far more beautiful than is apparent in this recording.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|Nothing bad to day about this product. From the second you take it out of the box you feel its quality. This is much better than the USB version[[ASIN:B00486070K APPLE USB ETHERNET ADAPTER - ZML]] as it has a thicker cord and isn't as flexible. The problem with the USB version is that it's too flexible and often feels like it's going to tear the sheathing and put a break in the wire.<br /><br />I use mine on the macbook air which is great because I don't have and other thunderbolt accessories and the old usb version took up one of the two usb ports. When you only have 2 usb ports it cripples the use of the machine and forces you to buy an additional usb hub if you need the space.<br /><br />Speed is top notch also. It is gigabit ethernet so I'm getting the fastest possible speeds I can.<br /><br />5 Star Apple quality all the way.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app - much better than several others I've tried. No problems on my Kindle Fire.

I especially like the radar maps since my Kindle doesn't play the ones online.
1400067936|5.0|I read this book after it was suggested to me by a \\"wannabe trader.\\" As someone who started this book as a dualist and empiricist, finished it as an extreme skepticist, and then analyzed it along with modern philosophy to become something completely different, I can say Fooled By Randomness is a must read for all future investors and perhaps all human beings.<br /><br />The Author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is a trader who has observed the swings of marketplace, the various \\"busts and booms\\" of the last three decades, and the vast number of trader busts where traders lose all of their money, and has concluded that many trusted fields in academia, such as economics, political philosophy, history (historicism in particular), some biology and chemistry, and medical data analysis, suffer from the same problem of logical induction that plagues analyzers of the financial markets. The future does not have to reflect the past; there is no reason it should. Taleb illustrates this in different ways, describing the urn of randomness, where 20 red balls are in the urn along with one blue ball; an astute observer finds that drawing 5 red balls or 6 red balls makes no difference in our knowledge, since we cannot conclude anything of the rest of the balls in the urn since we don't know how many balls are in the urn, how many blue balls or how many red balls are in there, and therefore cannot make mathematical calculations that are based on fallacious assumptions to infer any kind of knowledge of the rest of the balls that we have not yet drawn and observed. Statisticians suffer from inductive knowledge when they claim that our knowledge of sample data yet to be shown increases by a factor of the square root of n, when the number of sample sizes increase by n. For example, when we compare a sample size of two with a sample size of one, we have a relative knowledge difference of 1.41 (approximately) compared with 1. The hilarious and ironic thing is that the study of statistics, whichis supposed to study randomness, organizes randomness into aesthetically pleasing patterns, and forgets to treat randomness as truly random, as unpredictable, as impossible to determine. The bell curve treats world events as following a recongnizable pattern, and various statistical techniques often commit the same error, when events are truly random and unable to predict.<br /><br />Taleb's exploration of randomness eventually meets philosophy and Taleb's theories study of randomness detours into the works of various classical philosophers and several modern philosophers; perhaps the most cited and the most important to Fooled By Randomness is Karl Popper. Popper assumes that all theories of this world are (a) either already falsfied by the observation or existence of something which contradicts the theory or (b) are yet to be falsified. The percieved opposite of the Popper theory is perhaps the verificationist principle, which states that a statement cannot be true, unless it can be proven as true and can be completely proven. The problem with the verificationist principle which David Hume confronted in his explorations is the problem of induction. For example, if I see 4000 white swans for example, how can I induce that all swans are white when the observation of one black swan will falsify my induction? This observation was assidiously studied by Karl Popper who then came up with a different theory, claiming that verificationism was too strong a requirement to prove because of the problem of induction, and proposed we can only prove things with the goal of falsification. The problem with the falsification theory, which Taleb unfortunately does not confront in the book, is that it is self refuting. Popper's theory implies that every theory or basis of knowledge is false, and therefore his own theory is false (that is, it is yet to be falsified), and we come with up with the confusing and meaningless conlcusion that falseness is false, which doesn't mean anythingand leads to logical absurdity. I would only take Karl Popper's theories when it applies to the physical world. Full acceptance of his theory would lead us to complete contradiction.<br /><br />As for the mathematical study of randomness in this book, Taleb reduces modern statistical assumptions to rubble, and most fields which make inductionist claims to charlatanism, which includes all of the social sciences, some biology and chemistry, all conjectural statements in science, economics and econometrics, statistics, and pretty much everything except maybe physics (which is almost fully mathematical), and mathematics. Of course, by insulting so many fields and so much \\"knowledge,\\" he is certain to provoke the ire of social scientists, positivists, and the very same fools and knaves he criticizes. This is amply proven by the the numerous insults and angry rebukes from people he insulted, such as the 'econometrician' Scholes, who traded a series of insults with Taleb, and numerous economists, and the backgrounds of most people who gave this book a bad review. Hilariously, Taleb has recieved praise from the very same economists and philosophers he has praised in this book, such as Daniel Kahneman, and Robert shiller. You can find their quotations in the Amazon \\"page of information\\" for this book. Haha.<br /><br />Taleb himself admits that he does not subject his own decisions to the standards by which he judges the world. He often does things that are completely inductionist, and all of this book was motivated by his observation of how random the world is (with his limited number of observations), which led him to make a series of statements claiming all of the world is random, which eventually led to this book. Notice how we have the Inductionist problem here again. The observation of certain events of randomness is limited to his observations only and is not universal knowledge, so making the statement that the world is random from his experience is fallacious. Noticealso, that this takes us back to the problem verificationism and popper's 'theory of theories' suffer from, that they're both self-refuting. Becuase of these contradictions, I wouldn't recommend taking falsification theory which Taleb indirectly endorses too seriously when it comes to personal philosophy, since it leads us to logical absurdity when subjected to its own standards and refutes every statement Taleb makes in his book. I haven't read the Black Swan yet (which is his second book), but I understand that the idea of creating some kind of statistical modeling on randomness (which is what he does in several documents he links to on his personal website) is also self refuting, because it assumes that randomness follows some kind of pattern, which makes randomness truly non-random.  I don't blame him for this, since Taleb, like all of us, is a human being, who likes seeing patterns when there are none.<br /><br />Instead, I would do what Taleb seems to do in his personal life, which is allow his inductionism to pervade through his interpretation of aesthetics, poetry and personal philosophy, and prevent inductionism from applying to the phyiscal world, which include economics, political philosophy, and practically everything under the sun which is not absolutely true, (mathematics is the exception). I would also disband myself of the notion that things in the physical world mean something. Instead, think of politics, economics, statistics and all inductionist fields as entertainment, or stuff that isn't supposed to be taken too seriously. Be a practical human being who refuses to see the world as somehow guided by universal laws, and never, never take wordly misfortune as a sign of personal inferiority. Randomness has everything to do with it. Be happy with with your own personality, and don't just copy other people. Be yourself. Don't react with anger to things that happen in the world, because anger will not change anything, and only make you miserable.<br />Let me leave you with the lines that reflect this message best:<br /><br />\\"We do not need to be rational and scientific when it comes to the details of our personal life-only in those that can harm us or threaten our survival. Modern life seems to invite us to do the exact opposite; become extremely realistic and intellectual when it comes to such matters as religion and personal behavior, yet as irrational as possible when it comes to markets and matters ruled by randomness.\\" (66)<br /><br />\\"If I am going to be fooled by randomness, it better be of the beautiful and harmless kind.\\" (67)<br /><br />Solon to Croesus--\\"The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in the course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all the variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has [guarenteed] continued happiness until the end we may call happy.\\" (1) :)

In reality, situations arise similar to this more times than one can count.  It's battle between what others feel is right for you, and what you actually know to be right for your happiness.  Michelle Williams did another fantastic job, and I feel the casting for Daniel (Luke Kirby) was spot-on.  Luke Kirby plays such a great character, innocent, real, sexy, sweet, and honest.  He's a good guy and knows what he wants, but is willing to wait for it.  I look forward to seeing Luke Kirby in more films.  I recommend this film!

The comic-style themed movie is a blast from the past for me and I had to snatch it up as soon as I saw it was on DVD!

B008FTAAG2|5.0|So I'm not the best at writing reviews, so this one will be short & sweet.  I absolutely love every song on this album, which usually doesn't happen to me upon first listen, normally songs grow on me as I listen over time...but not with this one.  I think Maria Brink is one of the best female vocalists out there & love hearing her sing & scream.  I highly recommend this album if you like it a little harder!
0446530573|5.0|Listen, if you're looking for a \\"quick and easy\\" Italian cookbook, save your money and go buy some canned sauce! The first dish I made was the baked ziti... It took 7 hours due to my inexperience and the fact that I didn't make the sauce ahead of time. That said, it was such a hit with my 3 teenagers that I've been cooking straight out of the book at least twice a month for \\"special family dinners\\" ever since! This is from a Dad with two working parents in the home and three busy teenage daughters... BUY THE BOOK. Great authentic recipes and great potential \\"bonding time\\" while cooking with your kids. There's a definite \\"cheesy\\" factor from the over-done Soprano's theme and fictional stories, but the recipes are first rate, top notch, genuine Italian home-cooked beauty!!! It's an older book... buy it used like I did, the pages don't spoil ;-)
1439153663|2.0|Like some other reviewers, I am confused by the excellent ratings for this book.<br /><br />The book is narrated primarily by Lavinia, an orphaned indentured servant, making Kitchen House one of the very few books to talk about slavery in the American south through the eyes of a (white) indentured servant.  This unique and interesting premise is, I believe, the reason behind so many positive reviews.<br /><br />However I was disappointed by the unbelievable characters and the episodic plot. I hope that Ms. Grissom continues to work at the difficult craft of writing as she clearly has some interesting stories to tell.<br /><br />If you are interested in this topic, and would like to read a real page turner,  I recommend [[ASIN:080214229X The Lost German Slave Girl: The Extraordinary True Story of Sally Miller and Her Fight for Freedom in Old New Orleans]] by John Bailey.  Mr. Bailey was researching laws pertaining to slaves in the nineteenth century and he chanced upon a legal case about a true-life Lavinia.  Sally Miller was an indentured servant whose family all died when she arrived in America as a little girl,  Mr. Bailey presents an informative read (the laws pertaining to slavery will chill your blood) -- and, while non-fiction, his book is a well plotted exciting courtroom drama.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|These books were excited for all the raunchy sex but everything else was anti-climatic. Any of the scenes building up to action, other than boners and bondage, were quickly resolved and honestly not that awesome. Plus, Ana's and Christian's character's are unrealistic; there is no way some sexually-charged, attractive, athletic, young, famous billionare with woman at his becking call is going to fall in love and \\"tie the knot\\" so quickly. And Ana claims to be this bright, intelligent, attractive woman who is so independent. Yet, she quickly changes to accomodate Christian's charms? I also doubt such a successful person as Christian Gray would be so self-loathing and angry? I don't see it realistic that he be able to overcome his insecurities and childhood fears all due to the love of one young, impressionable woman? When how many other woman before Ana had loved him? Everything from the quickly developed \\"love\\" between the two, to the unrealistic virgin organisms Ana recieves, to Mrs. Robinson's desire to \\"fall on her own sword\\" so quickly, creates nothing but an fanatasy-like world.

B005LAIHPE|3.0|Essentially a kid's comic book with the accompanying level of depth, expectation or creativity. I suspect if I were 12 and under - this might be the perfect summer movie.<br /><br />However, that said, it had very brief moments of fun, primarily as the 'teams' begin to play Battleship with real ships.<br /><br />Was quite fascinated with the aliens, appreciated that they were humanoid. Mildly bored with screening ETs represented by various Geiger-inspired slippery insectile and tentacled slimy cephalopods. They had a good ride the past ten-fifteen years, time to move onto something new I think.<br /><br />Again, massive plotholes notwithstanding, if you're looking for a kid's movie - this is for you.<br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- Not sure how many caught Director Peter Berg in a cameo role as a CIC operator. The free-spirited actor/director has shown he can do so much more with the right material. And I hope he's not forced to again draw from the Michael Bay palette.<br /><br />- I'm of the mindset that this is the worst Liam Neeson performance ever. And given his recent string of pay-for-play walkthrough performances, I wonder if he's serious about the craft any longer? Not sure what his effort represents beyond collecting a paycheck. Hate to delve into the man's personal life, but there is a measurable correlation in his career decision-making and the sad untimely passing of his wife; taking on projects that I suspect fill his time and wallet, but not his r&eacute;sum&eacute; of previous quality roles.<br /><br />- Interestingly and conversely, I found Tadanobu Asano as the Japanese naval officer, surprisingly genuine. A lone actor stranded amongst a litter-filled field of mediocrity. About the only interesting aspect to this production for cinephiles.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  Guessing the author writes about love affairs she only fantasizes.  Read this only to satisfy curiosity.  Now, I regret that I have become nothing more than one of the lemmings falling of the cliff.  This is a read that only fantasizing women van enjoy.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I have liked this show since they introduced it in NCIS.  The transfer is crisp and clean.  I did not have any problems with any of the discs in this set.  The writing on this show is great.  The first season of this show is a good one and it can only improve from here.  I recommend this set to any fan.

0393088774|5.0|This book is very well argued and presented. The material is logical and the content flowing. Reading this book is like having a personal conversation with the author. I simply couldn't put the book down and read it in one weekend in the midst of many other activities. When I get time I plan to read it again before the presidential election. One of the best politics/economy/government books I have read. PS I have a BA in Economics from Washington University in St. Louis.
B003I7BBZ0|3.0|I was so excited to see Smurfs back in circulation and so was my 5yr old that I got her 3 of the sets for her birthday.  Pieces are very small, hard to manipulate for younger kids and they don't hold together well which is frustrating even for my 7yr old.  Very disappointing for Megabloks which are supposed to be bigger than regular Legos.  It would be nice to have them increased to a larger scale.

1466401885|4.0|Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire is exactly as the title says. It's a beautiful disaster. The characters can be abrupt and violent and codependent and you know some of the things they say or do are totally wrong. But at the same time they're sweet and somehow make you fall in love even despite all of their issues. There were so many things I loved and hated about Beautiful Disaster, I'm pretty sure the internal conflict it presented me just made me enjoy it even more.<br /><br />Abby was a really cute character at first. Don't get me wrong, I still liked her as the book got into the swing of things, but she was pretty hypocritical. She was mad at Travis for playing games with her and accusing her of playing games with him, yet she really did play with him the whole time they were friends. The second he started to have real feelings for her she used them against him every chance she got. Either she's got really bad timing, or she is a queen of manipulation. Still, I liked her, but I can see how some people might get annoyed with her.<br /><br />Travis is super sweet and sexy... for most of the book. Somewhere around the middle he gets almost violently obsessed with his relationship with Abby. He's super jealous of everyone and Abby does little to help things. He's got issues. And I'd just like to warn anyone thinking of reading Beautiful Disaster of these issues, because this book will not be for everyone. I can see a lot of people getting so fed up with Travis's behavior that they refuse to finish the book. But you have to know he means well. I'm not saying it's right for him to be so possessive of Abby or to get mad at every little thing (personally I'd never have put up with that sort of thing), but he has his issues and he does try to work them out throughout the book. I think he comes a long way from the beginning of the book to the end. Beautiful Disaster is about Travis and Abby's love, imperfections, stupid decisions and all, and I enjoyed reading every second of it.<br /><br />Travis and Abby's relationship was so sweet, yet completely frustrating. But that's what made them so awesome to read about! It was like watching a girl date one guy, but then come home to her husband every night. And both guys know what's going on. It could be amusing at times, and sometimes just plain old cruel. Let's just say, this girl takes playing hard to get to a whole new level. Their whole relationship was like watching a train wreck. No matter what kind of horrors you see, you can't seem to turn away. If nothing else, it hooked me in and kept me reading to the very last page. Beautiful Disaster goes places I never expected when reading the synopsis. It was completely addicting!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a book that I'm sure many people will love. I loved it. I had some issues with the characters behavior toward one another (the irrational possessiveness, and dependency that bordered on stalking mostly), but that's who these characters are. That's how their story goes and I appreciated that. I definitely recommend Beautiful Disaster to anyone who likes contemporary or romance, but this is definitely a book for the older YA crowd. It's not too explicit, but it has it's moments.cond of it.<br /><br />Travis and Abby's relationship was so sweet, yet completely frustrating. But that's what made them so awesome to read about!

1401233791|5.0|I read this after watching The Dark Knight Rises, though I had some idea of what happens to Batman already. It's pretty well known that Bane breaks Batman's back (if this is a spoiler, then you wouldn't be reading this book), but I finally got a chance to read a 20-year-old series.<br /><br />The opening pages are a thrill to read, and set up the rest of the series nicely, though I've yet to read the rest of the Knightfall volumes, Batman's fall and rise are set up wonderfully. First, we learn about Bane's origins, and his motivation for taking over Gotham. After that, I felt that the comics sort of valleyed for a bit, but I realize they were set up that way to present Batman's demise.<br /><br />The comics are extremely well written, some of the best I've seen in any paneled books with the narration and dialogue (especially in seeing Jean Paul Valley). There were peaks and valleys throughout, but overall I can't give this any less than 5 stars. It's a fascinating read, almost a requirement.

0756405890|2.0|I listened to the audio book while I drive to and from work 30min each way. It's a boring drive so I don't mind boring books but this one was boring and abrasive. There were parts of the book that I liked but for the most part I found it quite boring. Nothing really happens until the very end of the book.<br />The biggest problem with this book is that there is basically no plot. There is a beginning but there is no middle and no end in sight. Really, all it is is a list of events in chronological order until the author thought it was long enough that he had to cut it off. That is not the same as a plot!<br />The other problem with the book is that the main character is too contradictory. He's an arrogant, outgoing, witty, smart-ass who can sell a ketchup Popsicle to a man wearing white gloves but he's shy and clueless around girls? huh? and can't seem to ever have enough money to feed himself either? What?<br />Plus the fact that he's way too overpowered and awesome at every kind of magic, remembers everything, knows everything...<br />Another peeve with this book is that it felt like he spent half the book as a beggar/steet kid with amnesia, talk about cliche and BOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNGGGGG.<br />My last annoyance is the authors preoccupation with keeping Kvothe beggar poor the whole book. Is that the best kind of conflict that the author can think of for him to overcome? It's just chapter after chapter of him trying to scrape together enough pennies to pay tuition and eat.<br />Despite the above problems I've decided to give it two stars because I did finish the book and I liked the idea of the magic system, runes, naming, etc. I can't give it more than two though because of the sequel. I don't think I could ever recommend \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" to anyone. I'd just be too embarrassed because of the preoccupation with sex throughout the second book. Since I can't recommend the sequel I can't recommend this book either. Good going Rothfuss. Your trilogy? series?whatever it is, won't ever become big like Harry Potter because parents won't want their kids reading this stuff.
0930289455|5.0|I don't normally give reviews on Amazon, but I've got to say this is by far the best, most insane book I've ever read, but I don't like novels nearly as much as graphic novels, so consider this review biased, but it is definitely a read worthwhile.
0756407125|1.0|I liked the first book and I liked this book enough to finish it but the reason I gave this one star is that I'd be embarrassed to recommend this book to anyone and I feel embarrassed for the person that recommended the first book to me. The amount of sexual content was completely inappropriate and unexpected considering how clean the first book was. This book is preoccupied with sex and the author devotes chapters and chapters to Kvothe's sexual exploits, at least that's how it seems while reading.<br /><br />Besides my first annoyance, I've got a few other problems with this book. First of all, BORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRING. It just takes forever for anything to happen and even when it does happen it has nothing to do with the 'main' plot but it's just more events that follow one after another with no overall point except to show how awesome Kvothe is at everything, until of course he blows it all away by some stupid outburst (which happens far too often to be believable). These outbursts seem to be the authors only way of drumming up more conflict for this overpowered, awesome at everything character.<br /><br />Another annoyance was when the author skips an entire part of the story about pirates, shipwreck, etc. just as a way to send Kvothe back to his penniless state. Really??? You couldn't have come up with something better and instead went back to the same troubles that the reader has been trudging through for all of the last book. Not only that but he's robbed blind except for his most valuable things, his lute and case, ahhhhhh isn't that lucky... Good grief.<br /><br />What I'm left with is a feeling like: Where's the plot? Where's the magic? Where's the fighting? Where are the rune crafted items? What about the unanswered questions from the first book that weren't even touched?
0385742886|4.0|Having just put down The Death Cure, I turned quickly to The Kill Order with the anticipation of getting some answers making my knee shake with excitement. The first pages sent a thrill to me as I saw those few minutes before Thomas was sent up into The Glade ... but then the story took a journey to a place 13 years before.<br /><br />This new story with new people (Alec, Mark, Trina, and others) was something very familiar to me. Flashing back and forth from this new present to their past, James Dashner does what he does best: writes a racing, thrilling story and slowly placates his reader with tiny bits of information as he does so. And it was easy to like both Mark and Alec, so I gave in to enjoy the ride.<br /><br />While it was frustrating to not get the history and understand more of certain elements of The Maze Runner trilogy (sorry if that's a spoiler folks - but I know a lot of people out there were very frustrated about knowing things), it was helpful to understand what Dashner did disclose and it pieced together a lot of pieces for me that were left undone by the ending of The Death Cure. Am I completely satisfied with what was given to me? No. And I honestly don't know if there will ever be answers given to us or if Dashner will continue to string us along. But I did enjoy a riveting, full-blown prequel that set up a world that was a place of complete confusion to me.

B0085A9HXS|1.0|That is quite an accomplishment. The movie was the lousiest martial arts demonstration I'd ever seen. You will cringe as you see opponents appearing on cue to get beat up in awfully staged scenes. The plot, if there was one, is extremely contrived and unbelievable. The SWAT team in this movie is officially the world's worst. I mean, really, they had no backup? This movie has been massively overhyped and overrated on the web, and I find it all very dubious indeed.<br /><br />Supposedly, there are plans to do an American remake. I really hope this doesn't happen, as this, the original film, was just terrible to begin with. There's a reason the film did not get wide distribution.<br /><br />This may be great for young teens interested in mindless cartoon action, but for adults, 20 minutes may be all that they can stand.<br /><br />Also, does anyone know what the Redemption part had to do with the movie? Way to pretentiously add it on to the American version!!!

B008TRUDAS|1.0|I bought this book on my Kindle based on all of the 5 star reviews (!!!).  I read about 40% of it and gave up.  When it appeared on the NY Times bestseller list, I thought maybe I had missed something, so I finished the book.  I am now convinced that the reviews are either written by all twelve year olds or there is some funny business going on with the Amazon reviews.  The ONLY aspect of the book I found interesting was the poetry slams, but you can just google that if you want to know more about them. Don't waste your time or money on this sophomoric, poorly written bad romance.  I  now feel as if I was \\"Slammed!!!\\"  by so many questionable \\"reviews\\".
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How can I say this....it was awful.  I downloaded the audio version and the narrator used Valley Girl accents to portray the characters.  Now this would be okay if the setting wasn't in Washington (the state) and if the parents of the main character wasn't in GA.  Neither location caters to those types of accents.  GA is the deep south with southern drawls and Seattle is the upper Pacific.  And I've spent many weeks in each location.<br />The story line leaves much to be desired.  I remember reading Harlequin Romance novels as a child with better story lines than this book.  I assume this is for those that want fantasy..a bad one/ cheap one injected into their current lives.  As for me, I couldn't make it through the book.  And that is a BAD thing.  I don't know where all of the raves come from for this book, but for your advanced and avid reader, it will disappoint.

B000W94FIW|5.0|Two childhood friends go on a journey together from Spain to the surrounding communities of the Pyrenees mountains. On their journey Pilar and her friend discuss the meaning of love, forgiveness and how to lead an adventurous life by taking risks to fulfill a dream. There is also the Pere who seems to become a mediator or advocate, a friend, between the man and woman. First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, BY THE RIVER PIEDRA I SAT DOWN AND WEPT by PAULHO COELHO. I've had good conversation whether confrontational or peaceable while reading through the pages. Whatever the tone of the moment ideas flowed like good wine pass the three people to me. The transition to another world of spirituality and beauty made me see that moments in my life can be full of meaning.<br /><br />I began the novelthinking one way, then, all of a sudden there was a switch in my mind. At first the male companion seemed to be the one capable and willing to teach Pilar the way to a spiritual life. I thought Pilar seemed more romantic. You know woman want romance. Man wants to pontificate about his great deeds. It is only after her male companion comes back from a time of solitude in the mountains do I see he is the one who will be changed by the woman's thoughts about forgiveness and what dream to follow in life. Oddly, when he comes from the mountaintop and meets the woman he grabs her and gives her a deep and intimate kiss. The kiss seems to say 'I want your body.' He is now willing to give up his life of spiritual growth in order to build a home with a white picket fence and do all that he thinks this woman, most women want for their lives. Here is the twisted dance. Pilar doesn't want any of the above. She wants to talk about spirituality.She wants to give her life away in service to other people. This is the walk, the journey she wants to share with her companion. I suppose both are striving to sacrifice themselves for one another in different ways.<br /><br />In order that Pilar's  strong spirituality is not overlooked. Paulo Coelho mentions Saint Teresa of Avila along with Bernadette of Lourdes and Of course, the Virgin Mother who understands our suffering because she experiences the death of Her Son. Broadening his points the author includes Psalm 137. I still have parts of the Psalm rushing through my head like fresh water.

Of course I can only read it in the English.<br /><br />illuminatedleaves<br /><br />Psalm 137<br />English Standard Version (ESV)<br />How Shall We Sing the Lord's Song?<br />137 By the waters of Babylon,<br />  there we sat down and wept,<br />  when we remembered Zion.<br />2 On the willows[a] there<br />  we hung up our lyres.<br />3 For there our captors<br />  required of us songs,<br />and our tormentors, mirth, saying,<br />  \\"Sing us one of the songs of Zion!\\"<br />4  How shall we sing the Lord's song<br />  in a foreign land?<br />5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem,<br />  let my right hand forget its skill!<br />6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,<br />  if I do not remember you,<br />if I do not set Jerusalem<br />  above my highest joy!<br />7 Remember, O Lord, against the Edomites<br />  the day of Jerusalem,<br />how they said, \\"Lay it bare, lay it bare,<br />  down to its foundations!\\"<br />8 O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed,<br />  blessed shall he be who repays you<br />  with what you have done to us!<br />9 Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones<br />  and dashes them against the rock!biblegateway
034580404X|1.0|This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read in my 24 years of life. I cannot believe people still fall for these dumb cliche stories about a normal girl who finds prince charming .The sex scenes are ridiculous, Anastasia gets mind blowing orgasms every. Single. Time and its so unrealistic I dont know any girl who can orgasm like that every time, unless they fake it, and every other page is sex and it's repetitive too, ughhh I had to skip all the sex it was just too much. Their dialogue is so BRITISH and unrealistic who speaks that way these days? And she could have set them up in Britain and made the characters British, since that's what their mannerisms are like, but no she wanted to copy twilight too much and set them up in Seattle, the whole book is soo repetitive its nauseating. I read the first through a million yawns and by the second page of the second book I had to put it down because it was just too boring and dumb... Don't waste your time and money... All the hype it's getting is probably from a bunch of 15 year old girl who have an IQ of 1
0517548232|5.0|Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College. Concise, well worded and simplified reality. Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt.
1597801585|5.0|The author masterfully weaves together numerous strands which come together gracefully, yet with plenty to surprise. Not a feel-good novel, perhaps playing to contemporary political/environmental fears. Still, I was easily able to suspend disbelief and get hip deep into all of it.<br /><br />Probably relevant here: I am an American, living in Bangkok for the last six months. Had I not come to live in Thailand, I'm not sure I would have equally appreciated the numerous and 'right on' references to everyday Thai society and culture. Everything from street food vendors to commonplace bribery and corruption, to the complex relationships between Thais and Chinese, Thais and Japanese, the questions of what lies beneath the many kinds of smiles, Bangkok's gradual sinking, near-universal reverence to the monarchy and Buddhism, and of course, the crucial Thai concept of saving face. It was nice to see so many of my personal observations serve as context in Mr. Bacigalupi's story.<br /><br />Independently of the story, which I certainly enjoyed reading, I appreciate that Bacigalupi nicely conveys a plausible, if grim, future for Bangkok. I would absolutely recommend this book as a \\"must read\\" to any Westerner who has either spent time in Thailand, or is simply interested in a futuristic take on Thai eco-political culture.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was recommended by several of my friends this summer, as a you must read book.<br /> I found it fast moving and thrilling. I liked it a lot but thought the ending lacked something.<br />It was a sad book with an interesting plot. Jacobs father was so determined and loyal to his son, to a fault!!<br />I liked learning more about the court system and made for an excellent discussion
034580404X|5.0|Just make sure you have plenty of time on your hands because once you start reading these books you will not be able to stop.  Sort of a crazy version of Cinderella, but I liked it. Might liven up your life a bit.
0761169253|5.0|Bought this for my artist daughter and she loves it!  Couldn't thank me enough.  Showed it to all her friends.
B00007LTIL|5.0|If I had to live with one CD, this might be it. Every song is a gem. This cd and Workingman's Dead anchored the band for the next decade. Beautiful, lyrical, and so very American...
0385342063|5.0|This was such a good book! I was so excited to get through this book. There were some twists and turns in the story that I wasn't expecting. Totally worth reading.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I thought I was over vampires, but this book has pleasantly suprised me. The scholarly element works well and I love characters. Anne Rice fans would appreciate the history and family elements. A great read!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I downloaded this wonderful Bible to my kindle fire and have loved using IT--- EXCEPT for the fact,  I can't sign in and use the benifits,  like notes, etc. youversion says they will get back to me,  but I need these now. tired of waiting.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I really did enjoy these books and they were page turners, I felt that they author was very descriptive but not in an immature nature but in a more respectful nature.  At times I did stumble upon a little boredom and became frustrated at Ana at times.  The author did at times portray Ana to be completely silly/foolish and immature at times and I think this was what frustrated me the most.  Otherwise I would rate this book well.  Enjoy
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Excellent/perfect fit on Verizon iPhone 4s.  The included screen protector was also of good quality.<br />The plastic material has decent grip and never gets sticky, nor does it get dirty looking.<br /><br />However, case started to slowly turn yellowish after about 3-4 months.  At 9 months old, the case is noticeably yellow and not perfectly clear.  Case & phone are usually in my pocket, so it's not sun exposure causing this.<br /><br />At this price (5.99) I'll probably just buy another.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game on my Kindle Fire. It is challenging enough yet relaxing. I find I keep returning to it over and over.<br /><br />The premise is simple:  Guide your raindrop through each level, collecting pearls and avoiding spikes. You don't have to accomplish it in a certain number of steps, but it's fun to try to do it in the minimum amount. If you can do that, you get a hint coin that can be used on other levels when you get stuck.<br /><br />If you enjoy brain games, you will love Quell.
B000001ESJ|1.0|This was once a favorite album and I had very high hopes for this remastered edition.  Unfortunately I can't give this a thumbs up.  I find it very harsh sounding and with a muted low end.  If you read others that comment about the \\"loudness wars\\" or \\"compressed dynamics\\" of remastered discs - I'd say this one is a prime example of that - of how remastering should not be done.  It's too bad, this really is a great album - just stay away from this edition if audio quality is a criteria.  I'm rarely driven to directly review something on Amazon, but this is an exception.
B007NWCZR4|3.0|B-side from the 90's to today.  Some are good; some are okay.  It's PSB and what would a collection be without the rare stuff/b-sides.  Maybe not as eloquent as some of the other stuff, but maybe it'll grow on me.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Enough has been said about musicianship and writing, I'm just going to add that I think this is a fantastic remaster.  I'm not interested in waveform tests or any testing of that nature, only on how it sounds.  It's great, it's better by a mile compared to the original CD.  It's not overly loud and the high end is clean and crisp without harshness, the low end is very decent and not boomy nor muted, overall it's a nice, clear, balanced mastering.
B0086700CM|5.0|Just one more time! I know I can beat my previous score! That's what you'll be saying. It's great fun for those who likes the speed challenge.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I just received the unit today so I haven't done that much with it yet.  I bought it to use with a Dayton EMM-6 mic to take measurements in my apartment.  I did a little voice testing on ventrilo and there was no discernible noise in the signal, besides that of my A/C in the background.  I don't have any problems with noise or hum as reported in other reviews.<br /><br />To test the audio quality a little further, I have been using it instead of an Audio-Gd Compass for a headphone amp and preamp for my stereo.  It will be replacing the Compass permanently.  I'm actually pretty surprised at how good this thing sounds hooked up to an old NAD 2200 and a pair of NHT Classic 3's.  It'll also be nice to save a bit on electricity and heat generated in my room compared to the class A Compass.<br /><br />Hopefully it'll prove a reliable piece of gear.  I'm planning a decent home theater build in a couple months so I'm going to be putting this thing through its paces as I learn everything I can about REW.<br /><br />I didn't buy the unit for any real recording, though I will probably plug my Bass into it at some point, so I won't be able to comment on using it for its normal purpose.  It does exceed my expectations as a preamp for my test mic, especially compared to the inline usb preamp that I had to return.  If it holds up, it'll prove to be fifty bucks well spent.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Boy, this book was really hard to put down. This is a good suspense thriller and when you believe the truth is written on the next page, there's another twist instead. Amy and Nick are in a very sick relationship and at times I felt sorry for both of them and then I wanted both to be caught. I wasn't happy with the ending, but it just proved the point that both of them are crazy individuals and they may feed off of the craziness. I have to say this was the first book I've read by Gillian Flynn and I plan to read Dark Places and Sharpe Objects.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This guy is fantastic.  I only discovered Joe April 2011 with live at the royal Albert hall, then I was hooked.  Ordered other CD's from his earlier years starting to see every plateau that he has risen.  Did not care for or purchase any of the CDs country communion.  Thanks to Amazon to be able to listen to samples is great!  I listened to the samples about 3 to 4 times and read the reviews.  After receiving a CD, it only took about three spins to see where this CD was headed.  The first three songs are worth the price of admission and all songs are five stars maybe with the exception of the last song.  He should receive a Grammy for dislocated boy and driving toward the daylight.  If driving toward the daylight could be released in country music and or standard rock, it would set the music industry on its ear.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think this app is very well executed and is pretty accurate . And the fact that it's free is even better ! The only bug is that when it tells you how long you can read books,  go on the internet,  etc . It has a little more time than you would really have before the battery dies  . But it's only 20 min.  Difference the most. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS APP ;D
B00009V7OR|1.0|Love the movie, but I don't like being taken for a ride.<br /><br />Ordered on 7 July 2012 and received today. Already own a copy but purchased this because it was *supposed* to be the original 1996 version. The set I rec'd today (14 August 2012) the cover shows 1996, but the media is marked 2003. Disappointed that it was slow to arrive AND it's the sanitized version. \\"Welcome to Earth...\\" and a few other scenes are either shortened or overdubbed.<br /><br />Still on the hunt, but I won't be purchasing it from Amazon due to inaccurate information.
B008ENNXQI|3.0|We watched the movie the quality of the movie was great , the effects were good,but the movie itself we were board with it too drawn out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm not a huge game person but it has so many games that everyone's sure to find something they like!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|addictive game that used to work fine until more ads to sell credits were placed at the startup.  now it freezes and causes my kf to restart. this happened once before and i lost all progress n credits earned. this is why i rated it low.
0307887448|5.0|If you were born in the late 60s early 70s, remember D&D, are any kind of geek who loves DragonCon / ComicCon how dare you not have this book? By far the best book Ive listened to all year. Im only a couple hours in and I laughed out loud I cant tell you how many times. Talk about having my childhood flash before my eyes. FREAKING FANTASTIC. I hear Warner Bros has already bought the movie rights.... so read it fast because its absolutely worth whatever you pay for it!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Must say for a trilogy, the second book was very consistent with the first in this series. If you like the first you will certainly want to read the second book AND the third!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has a lot of different games to play and keeps you busy but there are a lot of ads and the games are very short but I guess that's what you should expect with mini. games
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This 3rd book was a little far fetched and the ending was predictable and cheesy. But would recommend it to round out the trilogy
B005T87QCI|1.0|i didnt listen to the reviews and should have. everything everyone said is right this game sucks!! do not buy!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is awesome you can breed dragons and get a baby dragon that's worth over 400 gold!!!! but for only 20 coins!! I severely suggest this it may take away money but only 1 or 5 dollars but its way better than 20. 10. or even 30! so I suggest this game if hour not afraid of money or fun
B0086700CM|3.0|it was a nice game yet it has no ending doing the same thing just going faster and faster as you go.
0425263908|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much it felt like 50 shades all over again but with better writting. The story feels like a more realisitc Ana Steele I mean what kind of girl goes from virgin to nemphmaniac. Most women are more like Ava, been around had a few relationships and have some issues with jealousy and being a priority in her mans life. I really like how Sylvia Day makes you sympathize and rationalize with the characters both of them. It's not as much descriptive sex but for me it was about the relationships.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I bought this case at the same time that I bought my Kindle Fire and love it. I am often getting comments about how nice it looks and people that like it. The pocket on the inside has been very useful, I just wish it were a little less tight as it can be hard to get out a scrap of paper from the corner. My Fire does not move in the case and I have dropped it a couple of times without any damage to the Kindle.<br />As for peolpe that comlain that it will not fit, break it in for a little while, it will sit perfectly on the Kindle Fire.<br />A qualm that I do have with the product is that the outer layer pf the cover is not very durable as it is starting to peel off is certain spots.<br />But it's still a great, attractive cover for the Kindle Fire.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I bought this for my son for his birthday and I couldn't have spent my money any better. He loves it and is so happy to get it which makes me happy!
B004FP1WX0|3.0|Kept pausing about every two minutes, very very upseting. Its retarded to be honest. How many times does the movie have to load? The movie its self is really good. Makes you think.
B001FW58D6|5.0|This show is the most underrated show out there but it has THE BEST writing and acting on TV. I've been a fan of this show from the very beginning and its actually the only show I'd watch TV for. I'm always at the edge of my seat when watching this show. Fringe never disappoints.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|my mom alwas uses it when shr goes to work.she usualy gets wet in the rain because  she missredss it

B006BDHAX0|5.0|love it...fun and addictive. I like playing against the timer. Great for someone like me who has never played Mahjongg before.
B00447L4KA|4.0|I love this movie. Even though it has been more than 10 years since this movie comes out, its still very funny to watch. Pure nostalgia :)
1451648537|5.0|I enjoyed reading Isaacson's candid study of Einstein, and his recent biography of the late Steve Jobs is proving just as rewarding. While there is much to admire in the life of the founder of Apple, like his hero Einstein, there is also much that is cautionary and potentially sinister about his character that needs clarifying. Isaacson is the man to put Jobs in his place so that readers like me, followers like some of my friends, and critics like his former business partners, can better appreciate his genius. I like this book for several reasons: one, it does not mince words when it comes to examining the strengths and weaknesses of Job's personality to the point of outrightly alluding to him as an unbearable perfectionist and manipulator of the facts who sometimes posed a serious threat to the company's success; two, the author does a thorough assessment of Job's leadership ability to take this company from total obscurity to total prominence based on a vision that continually incorporated innovation, simplicity, and improvement. While he usually encouraged his engineers to produce a successful line of products like the Mac, the iPhone, iPod, and iPad, he could easily frustrate them by mercilessly hounding and belittling them when he didn't like their efforts, only to then take credit when it came to production; three, Isaacson shows how revolutionary the Apple brand became in the 1990s and beyond because it was dedicated to promoting a `cool' personality that convey sophistication, quality and looks. It is here that the real genius of the man comes out in his ability to demand more from his company's R&D; four, there is an underlying philosophical current in this book that looks at how Jobs continually attempted to view life in the greatest context possible through the adoption of Zen principles. His persistent struggles with his health, his associates, establishing his legacy, dealing with his adoptive parents and former lovers, and his imminent death make for fascinating reading. He definitely comes across as a man who drove for greater intellectual understanding and self-confidence in his life, even though it was usually on his terms. Some might argue that his `hard-ass' attitude can't be all that bad, given the current success of Apple.ascinating reading.

0099579936|5.0|This book is awesome! I could not keep my head out of it and before I could finish I ordered part two.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Only read a small portion of this book as I was trying to find some sort of actual plot. This book is not only very poorly written, but the content is to the point of perversion.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|For people who are looking for something different this is not the book. When I read the synopsis I thought it was going to be a really really intense book. It is kinda intense but the repetition of same vanilla sex over and over makes it a little bit cheesy. Hardcore sex is good though!
B0072NWKEC|5.0|This is a continuation of the adventures of Bernie Gunther.  It is an excellent insight into the internals of Nazi Germany from the view of a decidedly NOT a NAZI police detective. A great combination of an interesting murder/conspiracy mystery and a on the ground view of the Nazi hierarchy.  Truly scary that this happened in my life-time.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Received a brand new Rio blue ray, plastic wrapped and all. Shipping was a little slow, but no big deal considering the price. What more can I say? Great family movie at a great price.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really didn't expect anything from this book and borrowed it, no wasted money here, though I must say I did get a few laughs out of reading this as well as my husband when I shared with him what the author thinks passes for good sex. If you've ever had good sex than don't think you will be shocked by reading this. The sex is some of the most boring, unimaginative sex. The main male role is suppose to be a sexual expert yet the kinky sex is being tied up. Please! The author could have improved this book by a huge amount by taking the time to do a little looking around on adult toy sites. There is so much out there and she picks being tied up as the kinkiest thing ever! Anyone who has had atleast one mind blowing orgasm will have a hard time not giggling about Ana's. If she gets goi9ng so easily this girl shouldn't beable to ride in a car without exploding. The male's penis also changes sizes so much I don't think the author really has ever had a good visual aid as to what is big. The bathtub scene was hilarious, maybe I just didn't quite understand what the author was saying but it's was hard to imagine anything big when the water was only hip dip and he was barely above the water line. Beyond all that the think I really found most annoying and there was a long list the constant referring of the characters by their last names drove me mad. I've never met anyone who did that and I hope I never do!
0596009208|5.0|PROS: I purchased this off Amazon a year ago when I was really into amateur programming. What can I say? This is hands down the best Java book (out of the few I've read) for learning the concepts - using analogies that aren't exactly \\"professional\\" but get the point across very well, and by presenting information in a fun-to-learn fashion with plenty of images, arrows, diagrams, and changes of font, not like the traditional textbook.<br /><br />CONS: You'll need another book if you want to learn mass quantities of specific code. Other than that, this book gets its job done near flawlessly.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very easy to use with so many combinations and independent volume controls, how could I resist buying even though it comes with so many free soothing sounds
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I came to this book after finishing the Game of Thrones series.  At first I wasn't too excited to start it, but as I started, I couldn't put it down.  Anthony Ryan does a terrific job creating characters and a world that draws you in.  I think he puts George R. R. Martin to shame.
B008QWQ0FI|3.0|I've become a rather crazed PSBs fan over the recent years.  I've been eagerly awaiting this next release.  I've heard the song INVISIBLE and was VERY impressed.<br /><br />WINNER?  Not to me.  Kind of flat really.  The other tracks aren't bad, but it sounds like the production on these tracks is not much better than a demo.<br /><br />I bought the Robin Gibb tribute (I STARTED A JOKE) and felt that as beautiful as the vocal is it missed a LUSHNESS the PSBs had the last time round.<br /><br />Maybe it was toned down to force us fans to buy lush remixes to come.
0345803507|5.0|Very interesting book to read. Haven't read a serious of books in years. Hope the movie is so close too the book. I CAN'T  WAIT FOR IT!!
B000002SE0|5.0|Left unfinished at his death in 1924, Giacomo Puccini's 3-act \\"Turandot\\" is often described as the Puccini opera for people who don't like Puccini.  I find it to be well-crafted, tuneful and downright entertaining.  \\"Turandot\\" is many things, but boring is not one of them.  It does admittedly sometime have that overblown Puccini quality which can turn off some of its audience, but the right interpretation can downplay its flaws and instead bring forth the natural flow of the music and drama.  \\"Turandot\\" is represented on disc by many performances but three in particular are famous, each one from a different decade.  Below, I try to provide a capsule summary of the three performances' to give you an idea of their approaches and strengths.<br /><br />Birgit Nilsson/Tebaldi/Leinsdorf (RCA): This 1959 recording is my least favorite of the three, although it is a solid version.  The singing by Birgit Nilsson (Turandot), Renata Tebaldi (Liu) and Giogrio Tozzi (Timur) is excellent.  The problem I ascribe to conductor Erich Leinsdorf's sense of pacing and drama.  The drama and momentum heard in the other versions is held back here.  In particular, I found Acts 1 & 3 drag a bit.  To take an example, the crowd chorus \\"Perche tarda la luna?\\" (disc 1, rack 3) stops the drama in its tracks right at the outset.  Still, this is a mostly successful set, with fine singing from the star singers headlining the opera.  For example, the famous Tebaldi's Liu is an old-fashioned type of singing, but I found it affecting and her voice is marvelous.  4 stars.<br /><br />Nilsson/Scotto/Molinari-Pradelli (EMI): Done in 1965 with the same Rome Opera Orchestra playing in the RCA version, it underlines yet again what a crucial role the conductor has in making exciting opera.  Though he doesn't have the name of Erich Leinsdorf, Francesco Molinari-Pradelli's sense of pacing and passion help another set of star singers produce a \\"Turandot\\" that is vital and exciting-- and easily my favorite of the three sets considered here.  While analytically, I thought the singing in both the Leinsdorf and Molinari-Pradelli interpretations were about the same - that is, excellent - the EMI release just brought me more pleasure than the Leinsdorf, which attribute to quicker tempi, pacing and that old magic in a bottle, plain old sincerity.  Birgit Nilsson reprises her role as Turandot, with Renata Scotto in her best form as Liu and Franco Corelli as Calaf.  Among his other accomplishments, Corelli sings the best \\"Nessun dorma\\" of the sets I cover here.  5 stars.<br /><br />Sutherland/Caballe/Mehta (Decca): I listened to the highlights of the 1973 recording featuring an aging Joan Sutherland (Turandot), Montserrat Caballe (Liu) and Luciano Pavarotti (Calaf), another operatic dream team.  Each of this trio of singers tends to take a melodramatic approach, drifting over into the overdone.  Caballe and Pavarotti offset their tendency to ham it up by being genuinely musical.  Joan Sutherland's Act II arias, including \\"in questa Reggia\\", are given generous time.  I'm not a big fan of Sutherland - my theory is that she was pushed into roles above natural her range throughout her career - but these numbers are done pretty well, without the out-of-control high passages that I find so objectionable elsewhere.  Another negative is the rotting \\"Nessun dorma\\" Pavarotti turns in - he's in 5th gear at all times.  However, I found Caballe to be excellent, singing with passion, expressivity and technical ability.  Mehta leads the London Philharmonic in an often driven performance that is also more sensitive to the colors produced by Puccini, generally acknowledged to be an outstanding orchestrator.  I'm giving this 5 stars, but you'll note my reservations of portions of the disc.<br /><br />Recorded sound: Strangely enough, the sonics in these three versions was uneven. The 1973 Mehta release on Decca was the best.  The 1965 Turandot on EMI needs to be remastered in the worst way, because the label had a tradition of engineering quality which is likely obscured by the digital transfer.  I listened to the original CD of the 1959 Leinsdorf version, mistakenly sent to me, which I thought had significant defects.  If you are purchasing the Leinsdorf, my recommendation is to spring for the new CD/SACD version, where the sonics are supposed to be very good.he label had a tradition of engineering quality which is likely obscured by the digital transfer.

B0087240Z4|3.0|I realize that nothing will ever touch Gish, Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie, but I like Billy and I have followed him since the mid-90's, so I'm willing to follow him on his journey. That being said, I like how he has grown out of his 70's power rock phase and has settled down a bit. All in all, a great album and Billy seems to finally be comfortable with himself as a musician and has found like-minded individuals to help him create this music.

0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind is absolutely the best fantasy series since The Wheel of Time. I've read it and reread it, and soon I'll go read the series again. If you want a long read that takes place in a well-crafted fantasy world and contains interesting characters, humor, intelligence, and a fantastic and engrossing writing style, this is the book for you.<br /><br />I'd like to address two of the main criticisms I see here: It is true that Kvothe is not a bumbling farmer who accidentally stumbles into the wrong place at the wrong time, and so foils the bad guy's plot. He is not an average run-of-the-mill peasant. He is intelligent and determined, far above average, and that is why he is able to go above and beyond the abilities of common people. I for one also like reading, music, and learning, so I could identify with his interests quite well. He has many flaws, such as arrogance, but others go into more detail about that. He is not perfect, but he is smart. If you, potential reader, do not like reading about smart people, then I'm afraid this book is not for you.<br /><br />As for the female characters being flat, that is not the case. Kvothe's relationship with Denna grows. Not quickly, and not in a way that I like, but Kvothe, Denna, and their relationship most certainly grow and change. I do not like Denna, but that does not mean that she is poorly written. Her character is consistent, has motivation, and does not just exist as a love interest. She is difficult, and stubborn, and does not open her legs as soon as she sees how clever and heroic Kvothe is. I do not like movies about giant robots, but I do not say that all such movies are bad and should never be watched. I just know that movies in the giant robot genre are not for me. Clearly other people like them, just like a great many people like this series. Just because you do not like something, that does not it bad.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Fun game.I enjoy playing it on my kindle fire . Much easier than on a phone or on the computer.
B008OE05IG|5.0|This movie is about sushi, but also really not at all about sushi. An 80-something master sushi maker is still at work, striving to make perfect sushi. The wonderful second story line here is: how can children live up to such great parents? How can we come into our own in the shadow of greatness? This theme is beautifully explored in this documentary. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is terrifically moving & inspiring, while also peppered with several really funny moments. The father and son are rich material for this story. Watching this is time well spent.
B007N85ZXY|1.0|This record couldn't hold a candle to \\"Ragged Glory\\" or even any past Neil & the  Horse records. Slapped together with little effort.<br /><br />Neil has always been one to please himself, not his bandmates, managers, and now, his fans. I think in his old age he is starting to show downright contempt for his audience. After the truly awefull LaNoise this is a real turkey. Oh well, another 12 bucks down the drain...Hopefully he will remaster On the Beach soon and release it on Vinyl. This crap is going on the shelf.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|this book is so good, i got it because ALL of the reviews were positive and i didn't regret it for a second.  so good, so amazingly worth the money.[[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is the book version of internet porn - it is a fantasy of something that is not sex being called sex.<br /><br />There is also sex in the book but that is not as written about as the lead up to the potential for abuse and control.<br /><br />In this book the main character finds it \\"hot hot hot\\" to be threatened controlled, and the threat of physical abuse.<br /><br />Of course this is not sex this is something else all together.<br /><br />It is written very badly and I believe became popular because it had amazing marketing not because of the story or the writing.<br /><br />If you like fantasy then go for it... but realise that it is badly written fantasy.

B008KRJWEK|1.0|Game worked great initially, but now it does not work.  When you try to open the game it freezes up on the loading page. VERY disappointed!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is a pretty cool game that allows you to build your city so I like it I pretty much play it, every day for a littel bit. I like it alot
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will not get into the plot or antying like that, you all know that. I dissagree with the people who did not like this book. I think that the war between the capitol and the rebels felt real, the role Katniss plays I think works for the story, the whole thing with Peeta is heart breaking...ETC.<br /> Is the ending a little rushed??? Yes, would I have liked to know why Katniss killed Coin, yes, would I like to know about how Panem came into being yes (prequel please Suzanne). But I was entertained by this book, and i can't take a star away from it because of that.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Finally after two years of waiting the wide release of Avatar in 3D BLU RAY format has been scheduled for October 16th, 2012. As of this morning. The Wait for the best 3D BLU RAY yet is over.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Everyone knows the plot of this book by now. I had heard  a lot of this book so I decided to read it. I can't say I got hooked right away, I did not really get hooked till Mikael Blomkvist gose to headstead to investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, then the book really picks up. My favorite character is Lisbeth Slander. a smart, take no crap woman with a photographic memory and some real skills as a hacker. This is a really good who done it with deep characters. The only problem I had with the book is it's a little slow. Good book, worth reading.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app reminds me of the 1976 Bowmar Brain. For those of you under the age of 90, the Bomar Brain was the first pocket calculator: it added, subtracted, multiplied and divided, all that for a mere $100! What most people really did was divide 111111111 by 9 or turn it upside down so that it spelled \\"HELLO.\\" It was even used to figure out gas mileage. We were a simple people in a simple time.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? Because the only calculator I'd ever give 5 to is the HP12C which subtracted correctly with one less step (no = and then subtract) than all others.<br /><br />This is fine in an emergency. I don't have many mathematical emergencies nowadays.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Well thought out movie plot.  Great visuals, good acting, some innovative characters.  The movie makes you think.  Like all sci-fi movies, there are a few hiccups, but, overall, this is a great sci-fi movie.  Watch it.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|Really, aliens who fly all the way here to destroy us will be much better at it, again.  Everything in this movie is only OK. As a whole it adds up to less than OK.  Just kind of a waste of time.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is easily the most beautiful, well-written novel I've read in a long time. This book had me laughing out loud at times with its character's witty humor. Other times, It had me crying along with the characters. John Green is truly at his best here. He allows you to glimpse into the lives of those who have little time left. I highly recommend reading this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm not an avid reader, and I read these in 4 days. I wish the writer would write more say 5 years later,in their lives, not ours!  MUST read.
0670858048|5.0|We used Zoom in a Team Building excercise.  I separated all of the pages and distributed to our team; they had to work together to assemble the book back together. I look for team building excercises each month for our meetings; using Zoom was one I had read about and decided to use. The team loved it and it made everyone think about 'things not always being what they seem.'  Great Book.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|Somewhat interesting in that the film is homemade and the filmmaker created the special effects himself, but the whole thing is a colossal cliché: the wife is terrified of the entity in the house, the husband insists on provoking it (while the wife screams at him to stop), and in the end the demon takes over the wife and she kills the husband.<br /><br />This movie would never have been seen if Steven Spielberg hadn't come upon it and gotten it released. Now we have Paranormal 2, 3, 4, 5, and the filmmaker is a very lucky man for being in the right place at the right time.
B0013O123Q|4.0|Irreversible was a very hard movie to watch. The violence is extreme and often excessive. Sometimes I wanted the scene to be over because of how extreme it was- some scenes may feel like they last forever because of this. It really shows us how sick some people can be for no particular reason at all; these sick actions are shows so vividly as well. The movie has unique storytelling since it's told in reverse; only a few movies have been able to do this successfully, and this is one of them. The acting was also great, Vincent Cassel being a standout. It's a very solid thriller/drama, but it's not for the sensitive or squeamish. One complaint I had was the camerawork in the first half of the film; the camera spins around uncontrollably way too often, it spins multiple times and feels like it's just being thrown around. Eventually, it controls itself.<br /><br />Irreversible is recommended, but be sure you know what you're getting into. As of 8/14/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.<br /><br />Irreversible has extreme violence and gore (including an intense, prolonged rape scene), and excessive sex and nudity (full male and female nudity).
1475143389|5.0|As a former fat kid, I've read years of magazine articles and month after month never got any real solid advice from them on losing fat and building muscle.  All they made me believe is that I was a \\"hard gainer\\" and left me confused when next months \\"ultimate abs routine\\" came in the mail.  It took years to filter out the garbage and get a handle on nutrition alone.<br /><br />Michael's book, on the other hand, has no agenda on selling you next months magic routine.  He takes the time to let you know everything you need to know and builds a solid foundation of knowledge to help you better understand and appreciate the goals you are specifically trying to accomplish.  There is nothing radical about his approach and the book is written in a non technical manner that anyone can put into use.  Michael has even proven to be readily available to answer any questions you may come across as I have had several regarding some details with lifting and supplements.<br /><br />I highly recommend taking his guidance in improving your quality of life.  This is a subject I have studied for many years now and can confidently say this is good advice to have.  I personally have started his program this week coming off of about two + years of doing higher rep range workouts three times per week with two to three cardio sessions per week.  Though I am pleased with having sub 10% body fat, my muscle mass has been the same for over a year now.  My goal now is to build 15 lbs of lean muscle using this program.  Follow up review to come...
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought this for my AppleTV because my receiver only outputs analog audio on it's second zone.  I run HDMI from the AppleTV to the receiver and I run optical audio from the AppleTV to this and analog RCA to the receiver for my second zone. My only small complaint is a brief scratching noise (sounds like putting a needle on a vinyl record) when you start up the AppleTV.  Overall, it does exactly what I needed!

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I purchased both the 10th and 11th doctor sonics, so am reviewing both and comparing where warranted. : )<br /><br />Here's the main thing: This isn't just a replica of the Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver.  It *is* the Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver.  Word is when the folks at the show got wind of this they realized they could buy these more cheaply than they could make them by hand, and procured a bunch of them (they were after all, prone to get lost or damaged during filming).  So for Doctor Who fans... how much better a collector's item could you have than the very item that was used on the show itself?  When you play the Doctor with this you realize-- David Tennant used the very same device. You don't get much more authentic than that.  This is the sole reason I bought this.  It is a must-have for any true Whoobie... especially Tennant fans.  It's the \\"real McCoy\\".<br /><br />General ratings:<br />Fun: Depends on the individual.  If you go to conventions as the Doctor, you'll have a blast.  Otherwise it's likely to sit on a shelf as a fine collector piece. I'm not sure it's made to be \\"fun\\"... just awesome. : )<br /><br />Educational value:  You'll learn something trying to figure out how it comes apart and installing the batteries with proper polarity.  The instructions are well-written enough, which encourages reading.  Putting it back together can be educational as well.  Beyond that, it doesn't really take universal sonic readings nor unlock doors, which clues one into the facts of reality.<br /><br />Durability:  Rather poor.  Cheap plastic and parts that slip into place rather than clipping or screwing or twisting together.<br /><br />Rating overall:  Probably a 4 or 5, again depending on the individual.<br /><br />Observations:<br />* Be sure to install the batteries correctly, with polarity the right direction (instructions are very clear).  Note that batteries install the exact opposite direction of the 11th version, so don't take anything for granted.  You will need an incredibly small phillips screwdriver, which is a downside as most people do not have those in their tool drawer. You may be able to use a larger jewelry-flathead screwdriver instead.  Be careful of stripping the screw heads.<br /><br />* The device itself is rather flimsy overall, made of rather cheap plastic.  That's okay, it suits the purpose and looks fine.  But it warns in the instructions \\"dont' do this, don't do that\\"... which does not inspire confidence in durability.  It looks like one drop would break the inner workings and render it non-functional.  I do not intend to test and find out. ;)<br /><br />* The volume of the sound effects is significantly lower than the 11th version.  It's loud enough to be audible, but fails to render the satisfying ear-shattering nature of the show's amplified special effects.<br /><br />* The light:  split feelings on this.  On the one hand it is rather neat that it is UV light instead of a standard LED.  However only the tip lights up, not the entire barrel front as I'd hoped (rather disappointing, that).  It's not as bright as it could be, but is satisfactory if uninspiring.<br /><br />* The ink cartridges: The UV \\"invisible ink\\" cartridge works well, as well as the reading-light effect.  It performs as advertised.  The regular ink cartridge (which I would hope to use much more) is non-standard and thus has only one replacement source: the company.  I cannot imagine any way to rig a replacement.  That is somewhat disappointing as part of the attraction of this is being able to use it as a standard ink pen (although it is quite large for that purpose... it's a great conversation piece).  Considering the rate at which many people typically lose pens... that is probably for the best.<br /><br />* The buttons: There are three buttons, all easily accessible and quite functional.  The rather large button that extends the barrel gives the entire creation a rather cheap feel... somewhat of a \\"this fantastic futuristic device extends by sliding this giant huge button up the side\\" (it's not spring loaded like the 11th... disappointing).  The button cover does come off leaving a much smaller button with a screw head in the middle, so if the size of that great large button puts one off there is the option of just removing it, but then there's the matter of that screw, which is equally tacky (however, let's admit it, tacky/gaudy controls are an earmark of Doctor Who shows and is actually part of the charm).  The other two buttons quite adequately control the light and sound (one when collapsed and one when extended), which is a plus over the 11th version (in which the handle button becomes disabled when extended).<br /><br />A collector can hardly do better than to own the exact show model, with absolutely no question or complaint as to authenticity (unless of course, one purchases an actual show prop).  And there's the bottom line.  You do not get more authentic than this; they used the same one on the show itself.  It is probably unique in the history of collecting.<br /><br />Would I recommend purchasing this?  If you are a Doctor Who fan... absolutely.  This should be a main piece of any Doctor Who collection, or the one item you own if you just want a solid piece of Doctor Who memorabilia.  At the price offered one could not procure a more authentic collector's item.vice extends by sliding this giant huge button up the side\\" (it's not spring loaded like the 11th... disappointing).

B005LAIH4A|3.0|The Lorax\\" is pretty blatant in its message.

However, the Once-ler discovered that he could create a \\"useful invention\\" out of the Truffula trees, and when demand for these inventions became great, it resulted in serious environmental problems.<br />The music and thing on the move are catchy and funny but honestly is a movie full of political indoctrination.

That thing was useless! 'nuff said.
0345803485|5.0|Really not as bad as some people make it out to be. The writing is sometimes extremely repetitive and I had to shake my head at some of the sex scenes.

B008KL2ITW|3.0|Boy, what a story.<br />Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She is 19 years old and in her first year at Eastern University with her friend America, determined to leave her past behind her and create a promising and peaceful future for herself. The last thing she needs in her life is someone like Travis Maddox.<br />Travis is the ultimate bad-boy. Covered in tattoos, he makes money in a floating fight ring while having numerous one-night stands with all sorts of girls who can't seem to get enough of him.<br />No, if Abby is going to make her dream of a peaceful life come true, she wants to stay well clear of this fighting machine.<br />But, when Abby goes to see Travis fight something between the two young people connects. And Abby trying to keep her distance only seems to increase Travis' interest in her.<br />Because he is determined to get what he apparently can't have, Travis proposes a bet. He claims that he always allows his opponents to hit him once before finishing the fight and that he can make it through his next fight without being hit at all. If he does take a punch he must remain abstinent for a month, but if he exits the ring untouched, Abby must spend a month with him.<br />Unable to resist, Abby accepts the bet and soon finds herself moving in with Travis. And so starts an affair that is as passionate as it is dysfunctional, a relationship that Abby knows can't have a future. Or can it...?<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what to say about this book.<br />It is a love story but a very disturbing one. We are reading about two people who should never be or stay together. Two young persons, both dysfunctional in their own way and while they appear to feel happy when they are together, their relationship is one of co-dependency. This could, in theory, be a very interesting premise for a story, especially if it was followed by both characters overcoming their issues because they are together. But, that doesn't appear to be the case in this story. At no point while reading this book did I get to feeling comfortable about this relationship or where it might lead. In fact, my discomfort grew even while the story headed for what I guess is supposed to be a happy ending.<br />I'm talking about violence, obsessive behaviour, more violence and lots of issues that never got resolved.<br />When I finished the book I couldn't help feeling that if the author were to ever write a sequel about these characters it would be a horror story filled with pain and despair.<br /><br />Having said all that, I couldn't put the book down. I guess it was a bit like watching a car-wreck, I just couldn't look away.<br />The writing is smooth, the dialogue sparkles and the story, while at times horrific, is compelling.<br />I've seen other reviews of this book and it seems that for most readers this is a book that they either love or hate. As my rating shows, it wasn't either of those for me. I found this an easy read, but one that left me feeling slightly uncomfortable by the time I finished the story.hile reading this book did I get to feeling comfortable about this relationship or where it might lead.

B000005RQT|5.0|The booklet with this Anniversary edition gives a great History, and a context for the songs ( at times recorded<br />out of order, at others, not put on this album).The booklet even states which are Ritchie's fave albums. The single from these sessions is also given some context but is not explained in the way Jon Lord does on the DVD interviews included with DEEPEST PURPLE as a \\"DVD extra\\" on the British issue. I suspect that the disc quality is high because it is a German pressing and like Ritchies other Remasters, the German ones are superior ( at least in my experience).<br />  The first 8 songs are the album remastered. 1. Speed King: Awesome Start. 2. Blood Sucker: Great Riff ( I<br />never heard this before this remaster and it is brill). 3. Sweet Child in Time ( goes without saying, this is<br />awesome). 4. Flight of the Rat: plain Great rock, made great by these Masters. 5. Into the Fire: A very moving and<br />flowing Groove. 6. Living Wreck: Squealing Keyboards, Howls like a big cat or a female voice given to screams. 7.<br />Hard Loving Man; Prime Gillan. Brill solo in the song and the solo near the end which is left on its own and is<br />panned left and right, then comes back with the band sounds great. 8. Black Night: The original Single with the<br />standard fade, still sounds great, and even better with the remasters.<br />  9. Start of Roger Glovers contributions: The intro to Speed King, and the reference to Speed King as Kneel and Pray ( you need to read the booklet for this one). 10. Speed King; Very intriguing version.11 Take 5, studio talk; start of Cry Free muffed. 12. Cry Free: Brill Mix: Not part of this Album on the original version, but part of the sessions, and now restored. 13. Studio chat; Start of the Jam Stew , sort of. 14. Jam Stew; Awesome music !! 15. Studio Chat; Messing around ( makes you feel like you are there). 16. Flight of the Rat: Rogers Mix: deeper Sound on mid. Solo Comes out better. 17. Speed King intro Take 1, Messing around . 18. Speed King; Roger Glover Mix; Cleaner rendition of the song; Seems like it has tighter compression in the sound. 19. Messing around; Jig/sea shanty music... counts in to ... 20: Black Night: Lead and Keyboard have more presence, no fade out; kind of fun the way Roger does that in these remixes.<br />  Love the Anniversary versions. I wish there was a Second disc worth of material !! Given the recent passing of the magnificent Jon Lord, I would like to see some of these albums packaged with extras; and with Roger Glover reportedly having tapes from the IN ROCK and MACHINE HEAD sessions, this is rather important given the contribution of Lord, Paice, Glover, Gillan and the Brilliant but seemingly erratic Ritchie Blackmore ( I guess you can be erratic if you play like he can :-) ).
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Like a previous reviewer, I went to use my power cord only to discover it unexpectedly crumbled overnight.  The plastic casing over the wires was cracked and had fallen off in places.  I saw that Amazon was providing replacements and called immediately.

With my Prime membership, I'll have the replacement cord in no time.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!

B005LAIHSG|4.0|Everything from the phenomenal acting by Charlize Theron to the mind blowing special effects made this movie the amazing movie it was! You will definitely be surprised how intrigued you will be after the first 10 minutes...its that good! Even though many people are wary,because of Stewart from Twilight is one of main roles don't be! I am a very big fan of Twilight. Although I know many people aren't fans of her or Twilight and don't let that stop you from seeing this movie. You will be missing out on one of the best versions of the snow white tale so far, but is not for really young children for it is not you  typical G rated snow white film. However it is definitely a movie that should not be missed!

0786955570|5.0|Dungeons and Dragons has been around for years. They have had multiple rule updates, and this game is based off of the more recent changes. It plays as a simplified version that is perfect for introducing new players to the series and game play style. My wife who would have never dreamed she would enjoy something Dungeon and Dragons related actually really enjoys this game.<br /><br />It has 13 different scenarios which are like individual games within it. They all come together to form a complete story. You and your band of heroes are trying to protect the town of Bavoria and defeat the lord vampire Strahd. The game is played on a board that grows as you journey the dungeon and is randomized so even playing the same scenario should provide a different experience.<br /><br />In a regular turn you move, explore a new area, fight some monsters and then bring new monsters into the game. There are traps, different environment hazards, and treasure and items to collect and help you out.<br /><br />The game at its core is a story. It has decent combat and the way it handles monsters keeps the game at a decent pace and does not allow it to lull or slow down. But the theme and the story are what drives you. In the last game my wife and I had to find a alter in the dungeon and recover a holy artifact and then escape. The game has a prepared reading to set the mood, and then another once you find the alter. It gets you into the game and makes that quest unique even though you are doing the same thing as in others. If you gloss over the stuff like this and just focus on moving and rolling dice you may not enjoy this game. You have to get into your roles and use your imagination just like in a real game of Dungeons and Dragons.<br /><br />The game comes with miniatures to help with this, little statues for all the players and monsters. They are not painted, but the details are pretty good and it is easy to distinguish between them. There are also tons of tokens for monitoring your life, as well as pretty much anything else the game does. At first it seems overwhelming but it becomes second nature after only a few turns.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this game so far, it works very well as a single player game also which is a plus. It has 2 scenarios specific for this, but it is not so complicated that you can not play 2 heroes at once either. Each game lasts around a hour, and set up takes 10 minutes or so. I would recommend some card protectors as this game is card heavy. While everything is constructed well and appears very durable, a little extra protection never hurts.our life, as well as pretty much anything else the game does.

B000FVE3AC|5.0|Automatic - One of my multiple Invictas, Eco-Zilla, Seiko, etc...  and I like getting it out to wear with a suit.  Smaller than my Russian Divers, Bubble date is easy to read. Only question that I have for Invicta is why these bracelets are bigger than the poly straps on my 52mm divers?  Seriously, I had to remove links from my Subaqua, and this one - while my Diver's are on the last hole.  Watch garners compliments - hard to sell the purchase price of 109 to the Rolo crowd.  If you took the time to read the reviews - it's an excellent buy from Invicta.

034580404X|5.0|I wasn't going to read this series, but after all my gfs said they were really good and quick reads I found myself ordering the set(it came out in the set) and received it in 2 days!! I read all 3 books in just under 4 days!! At first everyone said that these books are about very vivid sex scenes, but you don't even get to that stuff until about half way thru the first book. Yes, for the conservative, it may catch you out of your element...in a jaw dropping, embarrassed state. But seriously by the time you reach the second book, it truly becomes more about the storyline and less about the sex scenes! I love these books and am planning on seeing the movie when it comes out! The author makes the characters seem real, not some fake fantasy type of story. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a book to read while enjoying a glass of wine!
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this game and I tried it and it was the best game ever!  I would say give this game a try the game is real fun. I would say people that play for the first time might not like it also just give it a try.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Prepare to get less sleep than you had planned to, you won't want to stop reading chapter after chapter. Has some great plot twists and a unique concept overall. You may get tired of the endless descriptions of the spiraling staircase, but some could see it as having a deeper meaning (no pun intended). I don't think the title \\"Wool\\" does the series justice, but the story holds its own. Definitely worth the great price!

B007SGM084|1.0|After hearing all the hype about this series, I decided I had to read them.  I enjoy books of all types and genres and with all the good press, I thought I'd give them a go.  I SHOULD HAVE READ THE 1 STAR REVIEWS!  I have read many authors who have what I would consider, juvenile writing styles, but James takes first prize.  One. Word. Sentences.  Oh, my.  Phrases so repetitive you are ready to pull your hair out by the roots by the end of the first book.  Whole phrases repeated ad nauseum.  The female lead is supposed to be an intelligent, college educated woman.  She allows her hormones to lead her into an emotionally abusive relationship.  Forget love story.  I don't care how good looking or rich this jerk is.  He's a stalker.  Controlling and manipulative. This is emotional abuse.  Love does NOT mean controlling every move and thought of the person you are supposed to love.<br /><br />By the 2nd chapter of the 2nd book, I wanted to slap Anastasia upside the head to see if I could knock some sense into her but no, I endured 2 more full books of the same vapid, \\"oh, but I love my fifty shades\\".  I was expecting racy, unusual sex scenes, including bondage and S&M.  Really?  What I got was not much more than what a sexually adventurous middle aged couple might try.  I would have NEVER thought that sex scenes could be boring, but these were.  Poorly written, again, very repetitive... and BORING.  I started skipping over them.  The recuperative powers of Mr. Grey were amazing.  I was tempted (very briefly)to go back and count how many times this couple had sex during the few months they were together to see if it was even plausibly possible.<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out how they plan to make a movie out of this mess.  I heard the producer was looking at Matt Domer (Bomer?) for the male lead, but felt he didn't come across as a man that loved women.  What a joke.  \\"Mr. Grey\\" as a character despises women (other than as sex toys), with the exception of hisadoptive mother and sister, and the jury is still out on those two.<br /><br />In short, unless you like a book with no plot, unlikable characters, unlikely scenarios, abuse passing as \\"love\\" and horrendous composition, skip these books.  Or if you must read them, there's a short story called \\"50 Shades of Red Riding Hood\\".  I read it immediately after book 3.  I laughed because the author had all the annoying repitition of the \\"Grey\\" trilogy and then a sobering message at the end.

B004HEXSLI|3.0|The description of the author's stroke was thrilling, like a horror<br />movie.  The brain science she presents to explain what was happening,<br />which mostly involved what goes on in each hemisphere of the brain,<br />was confusing, especially at first.  The best part of the book was<br />about how people who've just had strokes need to be treated by medical<br />staff, family, and friends.  I would have liked much more detail about<br />her rehabilitation -- whole years are covered in a sentence, or<br />ignored completely.  As far as I can tell she managed her own recovery,<br />aided by a loving but challenging mother, but without benefit of<br />physical therapy, conventional rehab stays, etc.  This brevity has<br />the effect of making it sound easier than I'm sure it was.<br /><br />Throughout the book she talks about how her right brain, the side that<br />wasn't injured, gave her a great sense of peace and oneness with the<br />universe after the left side was silenced by her stroke.  She believes<br />deeply in this euphoria, and values this feeling far more than all of her<br />skills, rationality, etc.  She's convinced that she can feel and<br />communicate usefully with the neurons in her brain.  She used the<br />stroke to change her personality and make it more positive and<br />happier, and spends the last chapter telling all of us how to try to<br />do the same thing without the advantage of having had a stroke like<br />hers.  I was expecting something more scientific than \\"drawing angel<br />cards\\", and discussions of compassion.<br /><br />I wondered about practical matters like how she supports herself<br />post-stroke when she can no longer be a full-time researcher and<br />can only do part-time work -- what about health insurance?<br /><br />Anybody with a relative or friend who's had a stroke, or who works<br />with stroke patients, should read this book, to understand some of<br />what they may be going through, and what they need.  It would also<br />have been interesting if she'd talked about what people who've suffered<br />from other, more common kinds of strokes experience and need.
B0089AF2DS|5.0|Well, I am pleasantly surprised with the new album from Baroness. A little more musical, not quite as hard, real singing, and good riffs. Well done boys!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I had high hopes that this movie would be good, but it was not.<br /><br />The story I found to be shallow. The country is divided into districts. Each one of these districts as a punishment for losing in a civil war has to provide two gladiators. All these gladiators have to fight to the death in a contest that is a reality TV show. It made little sense. As the film itself shows it is not a policy that passives the locals. Nor are many of the people selected the type that would produce a sporting contest that people would want to watch. We are talking here a blood sport and people that like to see blood sports want to see action. Many of these people did not even know how to fight. Many selected did not want to fight and tried to avoid it. What is the point for the viewer, to see such contestants.<br /><br />Nor did it make much sense as the game started to move away from the objective of the producers of this contest that the rules be changed. Surely, after seventy years it is supposed to be going, they would be extremely unlikely to change the rules.<br /><br />Furthermore, the action scenes are weak. If you are going to show a blood sport I would expect some real battles, some brutal scenes. Something more like Blood Royale.<br /><br />Nor do I see where all this money was suppose to be spent, the actual filming, I thought could have been better,  I would describe it as ordinary.  Surprisingly to me, the special effects were ordinary - no wow factor.<br /><br />The acting was generally good. The woman who played Katniss, I thought was good although not convincing as an action hero. Others such as Haymitch and Cinna played well.<br /><br />If you have kids, I would suggest it, other then that NO.
1468161660|5.0|Every time I see a huge review I think it is someone who is promoting the book...I just got back into reading and am obsessed.  I'm about 20 or so book in now.  I purchased this book and also the 2nd book \\"Point of Retreat\\"  These 2 books were 2 of my favorite so far.  I never laughed and cried so much reading these 2 books.  I absolutely loved all the characters, even the kids were the sweetest.  I really don't know what else to say except if your don't read these 2 books you are missing out on one of the sweetest and sincere stories you will ever read!!!  I would love to see this book as a movie!!  A few more of my favorites are Gabriels Inferno, Gabriels Rapture, The Witness.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|When you first \\"discover\\" Mr. Porter, you look over your shoulder like you've found a treasure you don't wish to share right away. I listened to this album like I used to listen to the wise griot-like elders of my youth.  Gregory Porter's music makes you listen and remember; listen and reflect; listen and hope... but mostly listen. His soulful jazz interpretation is as exquisite as his laser sharp insight on such pieces as \\"1960 What?\\" And his is the most sensitive reading of the classic \\"Skylark\\" I've ever heard. When I copied this CD onto my iPod I wanted to make sure to leave the CD intact, without scrambling the order of the songs. The CD is a journey and I needed to experience it just as Mr. Porter and his producers constructed it. From the gut-wrenching screams of \\"Black Nile\\" to the Coltrane-like whispers of \\"Wisdom,\\" Gregory Porter exposes a spectrum of human feeling that is painted in gradient shades of blue-black. I love this CD!
B002VWNIAY|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this classic movie...<br /><br />I saw Casablanca for the first time about a month and a half ago when it was being shown at an old theater in my hometown for a reasonable $4.00 charge.  It was one of those creepy old theaters (built in 1928) where an organist plays before the movie starts and again during the half hour intermission halfway through the movie.  Seeing it in an old theater like this added to the overall experience of going through a time warp.  This classic movie from 1942 stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.  I give this movie 4 stars.  I like Ingrid Bergman as an actress.  She was good in just about everything she did.  When it comes to Humphrey Bogart, he was good, but I think he's overrated.  He's always ranked the #1 leading man of all time in the history of movies.  I personally disagree with this, but that's just my opinion.  He should be ranked no higher than third.  In my opinion, the #1 leading man actor of all time is Cary Grant, with Jimmy Stewart coming in a strong second.<br /><br />Casablanca is certainly a classic and has some of the most memorable lines in movie history.  I don't think it's as good as some other classic movies from that era that are ranked lower, but you might disagree.<br /><br />I recommend Casablanca to all fans of classic movies.  It's worth seeing at least once.

B0000029PC|5.0|Having preivously sampled the Leonard Bernstein rendition of Schumann with the Wiener Philharmoniker, and been dissapointed, I decided to give someone else a try. While Bernstein wasn't bad, I found his rendition to be more hype or emotion than actual substance, hence my desire for giving a different conductor a try.<br /><br />When selecting a Bernstein alternative, I quickly searched for anything by the Clevelanders or the Berliners (my refrerence Orchestras) and came upon George Szell, James Levine, Christoph von Dohnanyi and Herbert von Karajan. Finding only complete cycles by George Szell and Christoph von Dohnanyi (both with Cleveland), it was an easy choice and I went with George Szell. Christoph von Dohnanyi is a fine condcutor in his own right, but George Szell is the superior conductor of the two.<br /><br />Schumman was indeed a good composer, but I was never that motivated by the Bernstein recordings, and they largely sat on the shelf collecting dust. George Szell is a much better salesman and puts the focus squarely on the music, with no excess hype or emotion. However, George Szell ddi write an article for the New York Times praising Shumann's Symphonies and saying they should be played more often. Bernstein can't hold a candle to George Szell in the Schumann Symphonies, that is how good I viewed the difference in interpretation. I will also add that Szell made changes to Schumann's original score, but the changes enhance the quality of the composition, rather than detract from it.<br /><br />George Szell and the Clevelander's deliver with a quality performance. Organization, skill and Discipline combined to make a quality performance. All the notes played correctly, at the right time and with the right balance, tempo and tonalitly. Szell keeps the focus on the music, rather than the conductor. Precision playing at its best!<br /><br />I found the 4th movement of Symphony No. 2 (Allegro molto Vivace) to be very convincing, along with the Scherzo movement from the 3rd Symphony. When listening to the 3rd Symphony, one wonders if this is where Tchaikovsky got the inspiration for his 6th symphony, which Szell thought was very likely, but unproven.<br /><br />A high quality performance of Schumman's four symphonies that I encourage everyone to try for themselves.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|This concert is nothing short of spectacular.  The Indian part at the beginning was led by one of the most beautiful ladies I have seen.  Anouskar Shankar is the daughter of Ravi Shankar who with George organised the concert for Bangadesh at MSG. Her sitar playing and her conducting the Indian orchestra was exciting to say the least.  The merging of eastern instruments and western was well thoughtout.  The second part was a lot of his old friends. Its a pity Bod Dylan couldnt make it. Still Tom Petty and Jeff Lynn recruited Dhani Harrison and Eric Clapton to make up the Travelling Wilburys. It was also revealed that George Harrison helped to produce the Life Of Brian after Sony dropped their support of the Monty Pythons.  Tom Hanks filled in for John Cleese in the Lumberjack song.  All in all a well produced concert and a lot of good music.

B008KPDYQY|4.0|I recently saw Jeff who lives at home and thought Jason Segal wasn't being himself and was quite disappointed by the film actually. Those kind of roles are meant to be done by actors like Zach Galifanakis or Jonah Hill or Jack Black but Segal isn't exactly your typical unemployed stoner who sits out on a couch all day long. Anyway, I was very curious what they would do with this film. Of course it is a chick film but it is also relevant for considering my age. I saw this last night and there were atleast three scenes which had me laughing out loud. The story is very curiously tuned just enough to pique your interest and keep you in it. Some may find sitting through 2 hours 11 minutes a bit too long but I don't think they would sustain the title of the film and the message if they didn't make it that long. At around 1 hour 30 minutes I did look at my clock thinking where are they going to take this now. But then that is my only criticism. I loved the acting, it was outstanding. The characters were delightful and entertaining without being over the top or cheesy. I suggest you give this film a shot.<br /><br />Crisp acting, delightful sense of humor and a well executed plot make this film a perfect home run for me.

For purposes of this review, we are focusing here on `COFAs Toolkit'.<br /><br />Whether you are appointed as the firm's COFA, or perhaps the partner in charge of overseeing COFA compliance activities in line with general risk management procedures, you'll find this COFAs Toolkit' invaluable in helping you implement and supervise systems for complying with the SRA's (Solicitors Regulation Authority) Accounts Rules.<br /><br />Note that, in being charged with this responsibility, the COFA is regarded as having a more focused role than a COLP and is expected to record all compliance failures and  report them back to the SRA as soon as practicable.  This toolkit is therefore designed to provide the practical and clearly structured advice and assistance needed for the COFA role.<br /><br />As the expert authors point out, (both are from Deloittes with specialist law-based experience) the book highlights the main regulatory requirements relevant to COFAs.  It elaborates on their responsibilities, including reporting requirements, and offers the relevant guidance as well as the relevant range of practical tools, i.e. documents and forms.<br /><br />Further guidance, together with template documents, can be easily accessed from the CD-ROM and adapted to specific requirements.<br /><br />Like its companion volumes, this book - now available from The Law Society -- is distinguished for its clarity ready adaptability to the needs of busy practitioners.<br /><br />The publication date is stated as at April 2012.this responsibility, the COFA is regarded as having a more focused role than a COLP and is expected to record all compliance failures and  report them back to the SRA as soon as practicable.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I SAW CHRIS KYLE ON \\"STARS AND STRIPES\\" LAST NIGHT AND WAS THRILLED TO SEE HIM  AFTER READING THIS BOOK AND ABOUT ALL THE HELL HE WENT THROUGH WITH HIS SEALS TEAM. THERE ARE A LOT OF \\"WAR\\" BOOKS OUT THERE BUT THIS ONE PUT YOU RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACTION AN D YOU CAN NEARLY SMELL THE BURNT GUN POWDER AND DUST.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Block Story is a really great game. It has really great graffics. I think that it has more potential than Minecraft. It has quests that you can do and more NPC's than most games. It doesn't rip you of like Minecraft. I mean $7 for a game that's not as good as BLOCK STORY!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a fun game to play. If you get it I bet you'll love it.This will be your new faveret game
0345535421|5.0|This series is amazing! I tell everybody they have to read it, and everybody agrees it is great! Like nothing else I have ever read, and I read a lot!
0439023513|1.0|This book is very poorly written. The story jumps from one thing to another in one sentence and it is clear that the author did not know how to write about the shift. Thus all of a sudden, the characters are in a different setting, things have been done, people have died etc etc.<br /><br />**Spoiler**<br />And finally the whole purpose of Katniss in the Hunger games was to help save Prim. Which does not happen. Instead we end with Katniss and Peeta having children, something she never cared for to begin with.
0553386794|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read, and I read a lot! Even those who arn't into fantasy get into this one. So many character, that you love to love and love to hate. Such an inticate story line, I can't imagine anything better!
1613823649|5.0|G.K. Chesterton was a polymath of almost unlimited intellect. He produced thousands of pages of finely written material during his lifetime.  Perhaps none other of his writings has had the impact of Orthodoxy, Chesterton's explanation of how he came to believe in the teachings of Roman Catholicism and the truth of Christianity.<br /><br />Chesterton believed in the magic of every day life, of Faerie in other words, and he saw the ultimate source of that creative energy as stemming from God through the Church.  It's not surprising that he had an enormous influence on two later Christian writers, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />Orthodoxy is less than 200 pages, but it is packed with splendidly written and argued reasonings for the truth of the Christian faith.  First published in 1908, it remains fresh and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />I picked up Orthodoxy again for the first time since my college days because I had been feeling downcast by the increasing anti-education and anti-intellectual biases that are coming to dominate so many Christian churches today.  Chesterton's masterwork is a needed reminder that faith and intellectual not only can co-exist, but that they must.
0143119680|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I know we should all be sick of the whole vampire thing, but this book takes a new and refreshing take to the story. Great beach read.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Enjoyed the songs I heard by Adele on the radio and different TV programs . Knowing that often only the best tracts are selected for distribution, I decided to purchase her CD 21 anyway. I was very pleased. Her voice and the song selections are all great and I have been enjoying listening to it.
0553801473|4.0|Again, it would have been so much better if they had published books 4 and 5 together. I would have read a 2000 page book. Breaking up the character like this really sucks. Story is still amazing, though. Don't know what I'm going to read now that I have to wait for book 6!
0345803507|1.0|Okay, before I get into details let me just ask a question.....HOW THE HELL CAN ANYONE HAVE THAT MUCH SEX?! 2,3, 4, 100 times a day, back to back to back. UGH!!!! I don't why I kept hoping for a better plot this time around when the 1st & 2nd books were crap! Ana annoyed the crap out of me, Christian is a child who runs the world (sarcasm), throws temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way, always ready for sex, while all the other characters were just there as space fillers in my opinion.<br /><br />The whole villain, 5 million dollar, coma, I had to save your sister plot made me roll my eyes & laugh out loud (I did that a lot when attempting to finish this book). The missing her birth control shot, getting pregnant, he's pissed, and finally accepts it.....predictable (eye roll). They live happily ever after with his still spanking and tying her up.....(MAJOR EYE ROLL. I hope Mr. Grey's doesn't see me rolling my eyes.)!!!<br /><br />I skimmed through about 85% of this book as I did the 1st & 2nd one. Don't get me wrong, I like a good sex scene...but damn, give it a rest already! I believe at one point I skipped a whole chapter because it was just repetitive sex scenes. Sex in the bath, shower, bed, piano, boat, plane......5000ft below sea level, on the moon (sarcasm once more)! Ms. James could and should have compacted all three books into one because they all took place within an 3-6 month period. The grammar and plot sucked (My text messages have better plots/substance). At the end of the day....thank God I didn't buy this book (borrowed it)!!<br /><br />Oh...and a movie based on 50 Shades???!! OH PLEASE......SPARE US!
0553582038|4.0|The only reason this book isn't a five is because of George's stupid publishers. They didn't want to publish a 2000 page book, so they made him split the characters stories into two different books! So through this whole book, you want to know what happened to some of your favorite characters! Poor George. His genius just isn't appreciated. However, the story continues to be jaw dropping. So good!
B001AXKV2I|5.0|Classic hardcore band that made a seamless & effortless transition to a post-hardcore sound.  In my opinion Candy Apple Grey was a \\"swan song\\" of sorts for this great Minneapolis band.
055357342X|5.0|I gave the first two books five starts, and now this one is even better! Soooo much happens! You will be tired all day at work from staying up all night reading, but that wont stop you from doing it again the next night! Recommended vacation reading!
B004Q3QRWC|5.0|I loved this book. I found it original in two aspects: the structure and the emotion.<br /><br />Structurally the story is a weave of different characters versions of events from different points of view and different times. It takes a bit to get used to and understand but once you start to see the connections and how each story relates to the whole things start to fall into place. I suffer from short term memory issues and sometimes had trouble remembering the names of characters from earlier in the book, however within a paragraph or two, the author gave enough context for me to remember how they related within the story. Unlike some books that seem to get stuck on how \\"tricky\\" they are being with the structure, this book isn't an exercise in being different, rather the structure helps the book and the unfolding of the events and emotions within.<br /><br />Emotionally, I thought it was not cliched and presented common themes in a new way. For me the themes were around ordinary peoples lives and the little events and interactions that shape their path through life. It is not a big, cataclysmic event that affects people kind of story, rather it is how those things in the workplace or people and relationships can effect your life. It does lean towards the disappointments in life and examines the \\"how did I end up here\\" aspects of life, but it stops short of being depressing and is actually gentle and thoughtul.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean created an excellent body of work with channel ORANGE. It's hard to categorize his genre, really. He walks the line of R&B and pop at the same time. channel ORANGE, however, is so full of substantial topics and melodic ballads that you forget about genre. It's not feature-heavy, but the features that do appear are perfect. Earl Sweatshirt provides a good account of the mindset of a super rich kid in the song of the same name. Andre 3000 brings the wisdom in typical fashion on \\"Pink Matter\\". Frank is singing the entire time. His vocals are great, especially towards the end. After a few listens, it's nearly impossible not to listen to \\"Bad Religion\\", \\"Pink Matter\\", and \\"Forrest Gump\\" back to back. It flows like an actual TV channel and is a great debut album for Mr. Ocean. Album of the year, in my opinion.
B008FGQKTG|5.0|Love this show! Gets better and getter! It's addicting and leaves you begging for the next episode. Watch it and love it!
0345803485|5.0|This was the best series I've read! So addicting! I wish I had my own christian grey. I don't know why everyone has such bad reviews but I think these books are great
B007L3BMGA|1.0|These books are just Mills and Boon with sex.<br />I read them becasue everyone was talking about them and they had good reviews, I skipped over most of the second and third books as it was mostly just the same, I really prefer to read something with a great storyline thats well written, would not recommend these books to my friends who have not already read them.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Weather Live features all the weather data you'd want at a glance on one page.  The graphics are very clean, well arranged, and detailed enough to provide all the important weather facts you need for as many locations as you require.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was wonderful and kept me up late for several nights because I could not put it down.  I read some other reviews which said the way the story skipped around in some parts was confusing but I was never confused.  I have not experienced a read like this since The Name of the Wind and A Game of Thrones.  Don't get me wrong, I am not comparing the storylines but the way it made me feel.  I absolutely fell in love with the characters and I will definitely get the next book!!
B0051T47NQ|5.0|Don't come to this film expecting, well, anything. Just sit back and, for once in the past year or so, just be entertained. You'll notice an initial nod to Blair Witch Project, but this is its own project, make no mistake. The film is shot and edited documentary-style, performances are really naturalistic and low-key, and saves the film from becoming Tremors or worse-- something made by the SyFy Channel. No, this is original, exciting, shocking, and even funny. Just watch it and enjoy the amazing Norwegian scenery, if nothing else. Great Stuff, and no superheroes!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|My book group used this as our June title and we found it engaging with much to discuss afterwards. The book provided an actual glossary of flowers and their meaning which added another dimension to the purchase.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three of the books in this trilogy!  When I finished one, I couldn't wait to read the next!  They were intense, captivating, a love story one might think is going to go bad, but then you get the next surprise.  Very interesting and easy to read.  Well worth buying for my Kindle.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I could not put this book down. Wow. The great things that Adam has accomplished, and the obstacles he overcame just leave me awestruck on the power of the human spirit. He is a true hero in all senses, when I think about the petty troubles in my life I will think of Adam and what he accomplished. His death was a huge loss not only to the Military but to all those that knew him.<br /><br />A highly reccommended read is an understatement.
0345803485|1.0|I don't have anything new to add to these reviews. I just felt compelled to reiterate how horrible this book is.  To be honest, I could not even finish it. I put it down at the part where (SPOILER ALERT) Ana  goes to Gray's place to deflower. Then I said to myself, maybe it will get better after this. NOPE! I went a few more pages and could not take it anymore.<br /><br />All the blushing, lip biting, flushing, muttering, gasping, hitching, doubting....it just gets tiresome! And Christian does not seem to be a very likable person. Rich yes, likable no. Ugh, the story just sucks and the characters do too. I did not enjoy one second of this book.<br /><br />What words have been used to describe this agony:<br />Repetitious<br />Silly<br />Childish<br />Nonsense<br />Boring<br />Fluff<br />Sad<br />Corny<br />Disappointing<br />Juvenile<br />Atrocious<br />Annoying<br />Terrible<br />Dumb<br />Excrement (LOL)
B002SQ364Q|4.0|Really makes you understand more like you was really there! So I guess, this is the closest I can feel to really being there. I am not sure about some of the things though, they could be made up to excite the younger generation, not sure. But when I saw a doc on Woodstock, I was shocked when it was describing thing that happened in this movie & felt like \\"yea, I remember\\" I wasn't even born back then.;)

B007L3BMGA|3.0|The book started well and at a good pace but gave no indication of what was to come.<br />I must admit a growing astonishment at the detailed descriptions which followed of gratuitous sex committed at an impossible rate.<br />The end could not come soon enough and left me feeling grateful that scenes of sado-machism would have to be entertained no more....<br />Bill Andress

B001NIC0A6|5.0|This is a great movie. I have watched this many times. Great action with a little romance but as things heat up a very explosive ending dealing with both physical and emotional circumstances. It has suspense but not overwhelming and unlike so many good movies this one does NOT have profanity nor sickening volience.  Try it - you will like it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|First book excellent and I could not put it down. Would wake up in the night to read. However, the next two books were draggy and had too much filler of nothing that added to the story. The suspense ended before it got good. Worth reading to enjoy story and know why it is a best seller!

B006P0FIGU|5.0|This movie is full of some of my favorite actors. Matthew MacFadyen is great in here as is Luke Evans. Mila always brings a party. Great movie full of action and fun!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book has been in my top 3 list ever since I read it. First of all I think the covers for this entire series look amazing, and I think it's the reason I was drawn to it. I love the mix of demons, werewolves, vampires, shadow-hunters, and basically whatever other non-human creature that are put together in this book. This book has a few points where everything you think might be true, really isn't. And action? This book has some. I look forward to the movie and the newest book in this series!
0143121006|4.0|Fascinating reading (4+) - as long as you don't expect Midnight in Peking to read like a Christie-style mystery. Drowning in detail about Peking in the late 1930s, I was ready to give it all up before reading the author's acknowledgments at the end of the book, which explain not just the \\"how,\\" but the \\"why\\" of it all. (Too bad the publisher didn't put this segment at the beginning - and, while I'm hindsight editing, leave off the superfluous subtitle.) The book vividly projects specific time, place, and circumstance, and French makes a good case for his conclusions and his reasons for writing the story. At its close, you too will care about Pamela - and her father.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app.  Makes typing so much easier.  After a couple of uses it remembered my frequently used words and names.  I can tap quickly, with many mistakes and it always seems to know the word I want.  A must have.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|There's an old Lewis Grizzard title something like \\"She Ripped Out My Heart And Stomped That Sucker Flat.\\" That's how I felt after reading Wool the first. I thought about printing it out so I'd have a copy to burn. I'm a book lover, but not since I made the mistake of reading \\"Green Mansions\\" have I been so totally depressed by a book.<br /><br />Wool should come with a BIG warning up front that it is not for anyone who has been prone to depressive emotions or long-term clinical depression. I have no doubt that someone who made the error of reading Wool while on a downward slide might take their own life. I guess it is \\"well written\\" in that it communicates the negativity and hopelessness of the characters; but I consider that using a good talent to work a mighty evil.<br /><br />It took me a couple of weeks to get over the nasty effects of Wool I so I have not touched 2-5. I hope my warning will help someone avoid this book who does not need to have their mind brought down into such a dark place. I also must say a prayer for the author, who has a mighty talent and has taken it and his readers into a slough of despond; may he and the readers be led into a brighter day.
034580404X|5.0|I was a little skeptical buying this series. I am not a reader at all and within 3 weeks I am almost done w/the 2nd book. I can't put it down. Surprisingly, my husband likes me to read it to him too. HA!

1476712042|5.0|My Review:<br /><br />I truly loved this book. this is one of those books that when I finished it, I immediately went back to re-read some of my favorite parts of the book.<br /><br />Travis and Abby have a tempestuous relationship. The book is called Beautiful Disaster because when things are good between the two of them it is absolutely gorgeous, but when things go bad, it's devastating for everyone involved. Travis is the campus bad-boy. He's a man-whore who makes no apologies about who he is or how he treats women, which is really, truly awful. When he and Abby meet, she knows that she doesn't want anything to do with sexually with this bad-boy. As a result, for the first time in his life, Travis finds himself in a relationship with a girl...they are friends, really close friends. They develop a super-close relationship that slowly morphs into something more. I loved how this story developed.<br /><br />Travis's mother died when he was 3 years old and he's never truly had a woman in his life since. He has four older brothers though who spent a lot of time beating up on him, so he knows how to fight. That's how he makes his money...by underground fights on campus.<br /><br />For Abby, she went to this college to escape her father, who was a world famous poker player and gambler. She's trying to escape that life. She has a complex story, but it's enough that she knows that she can't get involved with Travis in the kind of relationship that he eventually wants.<br /><br />This is such an amazing book because Travis adores Abby with all that he has, but she's the one holding out. To see this reformed bad-boy care so deeply and so entirely is a gorgeous thing and your heart just aches for him....actually for both of them. They are such amazing friends and are so good together, but things keep happening to tear them apart. I adored this book and absolutely fell in love with these two characters.<br /><br />There are other characters to love here too...America and Shepley, Abby and Travis's best friends who are also dating. Travis's big boisterous family of boys...the scene between Abby and his dad in the kitchen...heartbreaking and so beautiful. They all live through the up's and down's of Abby and Travis's relationship. It's an emotional book with lots of angst and I just loved it.<br /><br />This book was told entirely from Abby's point of view. The good news...in April, 2013 Walking Disaster is coming out and it's the same story but told from Travis's point of view. Be still my heart. I don't know if I've ever been so excited to see a book coming out!<br /><br />I received a complementary copy of this book in return for an honest review.ley, Abby and Travis's best friends who are also dating.

1401937268|5.0|The cards are a good tool for your mind/consciousness and I indeed recommend them. they are good. so ask your self will they benefit me.
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe for a split second that this is the #1 book in the US or was? Whatever. I have no idea how a book this *ordinary* in every aspect possible can get this much credit? Or peak as a bestseller at any point. Unless, the majority of its readers are bored 30 something housewives who *no offense I know there are exceptions to the rule but let's be honest here* are more likely to enjoy this kind of storyline with little to no character development and extremely cheesy dialogues.<br /><br />Eh, Where should I start? I have to say that me reading this book has more to do with curiosity than actual interest. I have nothing against erotic fiction, not a prude at all. I actually would've enjoyed this book regardless of what gener it fell under if and only IF it possessed the qualities that will deem it likable for my taste. First of all, the writing: Repetitive, how many times can Mr.Grey *cock* his head to the side? In such a short period of time? How many times can the characters start the sentence with \\"Ana.....\\"? in successive pages? We know that Mr.Grey is handsome, a CONTROL FREAK, arrogant, successful and is not gay we get it! The list goes on & on these are just a handful of examples on how repetitiveness plays a big role in Miss.James's writing. I don't know now, maybe the idea behind repeating those adjectives over and over again is to make a point and enforce it but I think we as readers understood the main idea the first time it was mentioned. Unless Ms.James thinks that her readers are somewhat daft and find it hard to process such informations. It is a character you're describing not rocket science please.<br /><br />Second of all, the characters. Ana is confused, snobby, whiney and doesn't stand out as a person with a good frame of mind at all. As the narrator and having the entire book being told from her perspective she comes across as a b*tch at times it's hard to like her as a person. There's not one intelligent thought that runs through her mind all the time she was telling the story. It's either about Mr.Grey, Her roommate and best friend Kate and how much she likes snooping around and putting her nose into other people's business and about random things like the people in her life that don't matter occasionally her family and school. Yoda, Yoda. Why would anyone with be attracted to such whimsey character who does favors for others and then complains about it later, like how she had to do the interview instead of her unreliable best friend and kept on blaming her all this time. It's b*tchy and frustrating OK! Kate is infinitely curious and not any better than Ana, you can't count on her to do anything either. I mean for a person who's so passionate about their journalism job you'll think she'll go all the way to that interview that she worked so hard to get and wouldn't let some stupid mild cold get into the way but no, she decides to spend the entire day being lazy while her friend do it for her and then she won't quit asking Questions. Mr.Grey the most important character is well your average stereotypical alpha male with a mysterious past and a rough exterior that set him apart from the rest of the man species. He's intelligent, smart, wealthy, he owns a company, young and of course looks like a Roman God with a fit body. What? You didn't expect him to be a 50 year old obese truck driver? I have to say he reminded me a lot of Edward Cullen from Twilight. He warns the heroine that he's dangerous, he saves her life from being kissed by a drunken spanish guy at a bar *yeah like that's bad* and he keeps on stalking her from time to time. He's just like Edward except for the fact that he's not a vampire and he's not 107 years old and of course he doesn't sparkle.<br /><br />And last but not least, the storyline. As if bad writing and lame characters wasn't enough do not get me started! Just read the book and you'll see for yourself.<br /><br />If you want to ahem, ahem get aroused then this is the book for you. It's mindless, cheesy and incredibly bad to be even called literature. If you want to read sex scenes and don't care about the storyline or any other thing then I guess this book will do. Although god knows there must surely be better erotic books out there. However, if you want a story with likable characters and good writing then skip this book entirely. This is Twilight for adults. I don't know maybe I was expecting something more considering how my friend was talking about how amazing this book is and how everyone is mentioning it lately.<br /><br />Ugh, if you're so curious to know just get it from the library if you must! Other than that I'd recommend you skip it entirely.r you. It's mindless, cheesy and incredibly bad to be even called literature.

There are lots of people who have rooted phones and tablets, and cheating in a videogame isn't the reason they wanted root access.<br /><br />Rather than coming up with a solution to specifically prevent cheating, Glu decided to alienate a large group of Android users. Their freemium model is one of the greediest out there, and now they are essentially calling everyone with a rooted device a cheater.<br /><br />DO NOT SUPPORT YOU MOBILE.

B008S4YZCO|5.0|love this game very addictive and easy to play the graphics are awesome ... would love it more if there were more monsters
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Ok, so you might actually feel a few brain cells die while watching it. But if you don't bust out laughing at least once during this movie, you are dead anyway!  Hysterically absurd.
B007MU85D0|5.0|i love them. just (finally!!) lucky to see them in portland me at the state theatre...wonderful musicians who play as a unit, each one interacting with the others, forming and reforming little groups w/in themselves. drummer kills it... they are all just fantastic, folky, sweet, youthfully enthusiastic, and make quite a sound onstage.....it's exactly what you hear on the record. no autotune here......!<br /><br />and, if you read the lyrics, someone, or maybe more than someone, in this group, is quite the poet. very touching, poetic lyrics- very deep, and very mystical. i'm enthralled.....

0062073281|4.0|Lauren Conrad has superceded the quality of her last series, LA Candy.  The Fame Game series is awesome!  I'm 31yrs old and can say that it was entertaining to me, and kept my interest. The first series was a little \\"immature\\" for- but being a Lauren fan, I read it anyway.  But this series was written in a much better fashion.  The events seemed to be accurately depicted, instead of a bunch of over-explaining.  The events that happend were significant to the story & kept the reader interested.  Thank you Lauren! You've stepped your game up, honey!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm pretty sure my cat wrote this. Not bad for something with four legs, no thumbs. It's funny when we first got my cat she had worms. Luckily I had dewormer in the fridge. It was difficult but I got it down. I was just reading about a woman who got pregnant with baby squid by eating them. I supposed this is similar which brings me to Christian Grey. Is it me or do you think of the Olive garden whenever Christian is around? They have the BEST breadsticks and sometimes there's endless pasta. Yes.....endless. I went there for my anniversary and it probably one of our better years. This was followed by seeing \\"the passion if the Christ\\" at the movies which wasn't as good as Olive garden but still made for quite the conversation. When I was little, I was riding in the back of my aunt's blue Volkswagen beetle and there was a thunderstorm. My brother and my cousin who were also in the back kept looking out the window at getting excited about the \\"firebird\\" that was behind us. Being borderline special I thought they actually meant a bird that was on fire. Oh kids! Great book!

0761169253|5.0|This really was simply a guy's notebook or 3x5 cards of jotted down ideas.  However, they were arranged and presented in a progression that appealed to me.  I didn't steal it.  Instead I checked it out from the library.  However, I think I will be buying a copy to have on hand.  In fact, I will buy a few so that I can give them as gifts (as the author suggests).
0316017922|5.0|Box  ........ You just referenced of a box, not from a dictionary but from you experiences regarding boxes.  This author tends to create the longevity of the same experience; once he tells a true story, you tend to reference that story.

030758836X|4.0|The story intrigued me after I saw the author on The View.  I bought a copy for myself and one for my Mom and then my sister said it was their next book club book.  I could not put it down, and pretty much canceled all non-essential activities over the weekend to finish it in less than 3 days.  Every time I was ready to take a break, there would be a surprise or twist and I had to keep reading.<br /><br />The different viewpoints were really a fascinating way to unfold the story and don't want to spoil the twists, so will carefully say that at different parts of the book, I didn't like the characters.  It shows how easily one can be persuaded based on the viewpoint and how the more detail that is revealed; your prior opinion can be altered.  It made me think of my own black and white views when there is a sensational story in the press.  How easily I can judge based on news coverage.<br /><br />I will still recommend the book to my friends; however, what I am telling them is that after the great three day ride, the ending was not satisfactory.  It could have gone several ways, and I think I understand the point the author wanted to make; it just didn't equal the build-up or my expectations.  Don't read this next sentence if you haven't read the book, because it may imply the ending....I think the author is making a point that when there is a sensational story, we want a black and white ending, a black and white good and bad guy and maybe that is not reality.  It makes a statement to prove to us our collective guilt in our reactions to sensational stories.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I had never head of the book or the author before but this was suggested to me by several people with similar tastes in books.  I think the cover art is a little cheesy but the story really sucked me in and I'm eagerly awaiting the next book.
B007KT6864|5.0|The symbols on the album cover speak to the contents: fragile vulnerability, love, and broken imprisonment.  I found this album when I first heard \\"Closing Time\\" on FM radio and rushed home to research it. I bought the tape and listened to it over and over, captivated by that low, growl of a voice, the clear and powerful lyrics, and the vulnerability expressed by the man behind them.  I think that this album is by far the best work by Cohen.  It will grab you and pull you in and you will listen to it over and over.  Listen and be overwhelmed in its luxurious arrangements and its vivid imagery.  You will not be disappointed -  GURANTEED!
B000A6T1JU|2.0|They totally switched around the whole scene with the lezzys and left out the best line of the movie \\"these girls would rather s***w each other than s***w us\\", plus they totally chopped out the dispute over who's going to be the new warlord and they try to make it look like a comic book story and where's the extra scenes? You guys hanging out with the guys who chopped up Requiem For A Heavyweight dvd - Thanks, now I'm stuck with this dvd!

B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is life changing. When I first heard it was about a shepard I automatically thought it would be boring but it kept me entertained and trying to keep up with everything going on. Loved it. Worth ever cent even though I read it in 3 days.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I love this film.  The execution is excellent, the best version, an elegant adaptation.  The music by Dario Marionelli is just perfect!<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska performance is brilliant, I love the fact that she is noble, intelligent and intense at the same time.  Without being too dramatic she communicates her inner strength and turmoil.<br /><br />Fassbender is superb, he has the spirit for the character.  He is a tormented soul who finds peace in Jane's unique personality and love.  They had chemistry, and the level of connection was very natural and intense.  The film is a tribute to real love.  That love that is so real and so powerful that can change ones life forever.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I almost didn't buy the book because of all the bad reviews written on Amazon. But I LIKED IT! My niece was reading it and she said ya, it was worth the money. So she bought me the trilogy for my 48th birthday. Is it repetitious... yes... is it fun anyway? Yes! It's not about the sex... it's about the kind of love that they end up cultivating... it's what we all dreamed of when we were young and didn't know what life was really all about yet. It's inspiring to me and I couldn't put it down. I say... go ahead, take a chance... read it... Enjoy!!
034580404X|4.0|The books were delievered timely and in perfect conditions . Perfect bargain. .... No problems, good recommendations. As far as the books, first book personally I did not like and the second gives a better story, have not read the third book yet.

B0016LTNL4|4.0|This isn't the best or funniest British film I've ever seen but it's not at all bad.  I found myself laughing out loud more than I expected.  The contrast between the proper, upper crust mourners at a solemn event in the gorgous country house and the outrageous events that follow is what makes this funny.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly good, breathing real life and vitality into what could be stock characters.  I got a kick out of the cranky old guy in the wheelchair, waving his stick around and screaming at everyone.  There's nothing original about that character but it was so well done that he cracked me up every time.  And the fellow who ingested acid by mistake was very good in a role that could have been simply silly.  I was a little concerned about casting a little person in the role of the bad guy but without giving too much away, I realized that the plot called for someone small, later on.<br /><br />Not everyone will find this hilarious but for those who appreciate British humour this should be entertaining.
B004U35IOG|5.0|Great book but smaller soft cover is less expensive. One of My favorite book and series of all time. A must read IMO.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I had to read this book for school, and it was really good. It is an inspiring story. Don't judge a book by its cover (that's actually a theme of the book)!
0440178002|4.0|As the first in James Clavell's \\"Asian Saga\\" this book can be read as a stand alone novel. It follows a British ship pilot named John Blackthorne who meets a Japanese daimyo Toranaga and witnesses (and occasionally assists with) Toranaga's rise to power in feudal Japan.<br /><br />This book is loosely based on the life of William Adams and is a fascinating look at Japan in the 1600s. Clavell is able to capture and describe much of the early Japanese culture and it is very informative. As Blackthorne learns more about Japanese customs and way of life he realizes it will be difficult to return to England. He gets used to bathing regularly and to the Japanese attitude towards sexuality. Of course, his return to England isn't in his control, whether he fully realizes it or not.<br /><br />The one place I think the book suffered is the conflict between Toranaga and Blackthorne. Toranaga obviously respects Blackthorne's knowledge of the outside world and his desire to learn more about Japan, but Toranaga is a schemer and he sometimes secretly does things that hinder or hurt Blackthorne. Since I liked both Toranaga and Blackthorne it was hard to choose which one I wanted to come out ahead in these moments. This is a small complaint but it is the reason I rate Shogun 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />In the end, if you are interested in history, this is a great book that shows the clash of European empire building as it begins to go up against the Asian countries and the early internal history of Japan.

1476712042|5.0|A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end. You live several lives while reading it. ~ William Styron<br /><br />Good grief! Was this ever true! I personally blame Beautiful Disaster for my subsequent book drought. No book can measure up to it.<br /><br />Okay, so the the summary pretty much sums up the beginning of the novel, but let me tell you, a lot more goes on! There is so much drama! I don't want to say to much in fear of giving everything away, but Beautiful Disaster is such a roller coaster. The whole time I was on the edge of my seat gripping my Nook hoping that a happy ending was in store.<br /><br />Abby was an awesome character! She was really tough and dished out whatever Travis sent her way. She was funny and stubborn. In fact, that is one of her weaknesses. Sometimes I wanted to yell at her to just compromise or see it from someone else's view point, but at the end Abby wasn't perfect and I loved her for it.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the infamous Travis. I promised myself I wouldn't fan-girl, but I can't help it. I LOVED HIM! Travis was human with all the imperfections that go with it. He was hot headed and had possessive issues, but here's the thing: he grew. Throughout the book, Travis was making some big changes to be a better person.<br /><br />The whole world surrounding Travis and Abby was really well written and the side characters were amazing. America and Shepley were entertaining and held their own against Abby and Travis. (A hard feat indeed.)<br /><br />Overall, did Travis and Abbey annoy me? Yes. Did I want to hit them and tell them what to do? Yes.  Did I love them? YES! Their story wasn't filled with perfect people and because of that Beautiful Disaster was full of twists and turns. It demands 5 stars! Seriously, go and get this book now!<br /><br />For review from the publishers via Netgalley. Seen on the blog [...]
B007U1FEJE|3.0|While I respect it is the end of their recording carreer, I was hoping for more! They are truly America's band. Unfortunately, they could not keep that level in this album. With their background, you expect more! Nice,but not to who they are. Losing two keys to their sound, hurts, and is noted on this album.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  This is a difficult one to review, as it is important not to give away any of the storyline.  I can tell you the author has a unique way of telling his story.  His narrative and dialogue draw the reader in. This is one of those books that I could not put down.  I must admit, I hesitated purchasing the book as I did not know if I would enjoy a book about a man accused of murdering his wife.  I only wished I hadn't hesitated.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Excellent entertainment; Sherlock Holmes fans will be pleased; many good references to the original Conan Doyle stories.  I think the violence level is somewhat greater than most of the original Sherlock Holmes material, but I don't think it detratcted from the story line.  We meet a lot of our old friends:  Mrs. Hudson, Ifene Adler, and , of course, Mycroft.  The producer even found a use for Reichenbach Falls, which figured so prominently in Conan Doyle's effort to eradicate his all too popular detective hero. This is a \\"new\\" Sherlock Holmes adventure, not penned by Doyle, but is generally true to the thenes, characters and methods that populate the original Holmess stories.  It should be enjoyable for Holmes many fans.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I got a great price from a very nice seller. I'm completely satisfied. Could not ask for better. And Supernatural is obviously awesome, I needn't comment on that.
B0034G4P80|3.0|I will start out by saying I am not much of a comic book fan. But I enjoy a good action movie now and then. I really didn't have high expectaions when I started watching this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the actual storyline. The Earth parts of the movie seemed a little cheesy and cliche but Asgard was very impressive and had surprising depth.<br />The most surprising and interesting part of this movie for me was the character of Loki. The hero always gets a flushed out character development, but it's rare to see the villan's history and how he became a villan. To me how a villan became corrupt is just as interesting as how a hero became a hero.<br />I loved how both brothers started out as equals striving to become king. One was conceited and reckless while the other mischevious but otherwise honorable. While Thor had to learn humility and his rightful place, Loki had to contend with the fact that he had been lied to as a child and was never going to be equal with his brother.<br />Tom Hiddleston who played the character of Loki was very good at portraying the complex emotions of this intriging villan.<br />Over all I didn't love this movie, but I did like it. I am invested in seeing where the story might go from here. Especially to see if there is any redemption for the fallen brother.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book is poorly written.  Same terminology and phrases repeated often.  It starts off as a fluff book and than turns into an entirely different sexual context and direction.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ultimately I was disappointed after all the hype about what a great read this was, I agree with alot of the other reviews when they stated they thought a teenager had wrote it! Bland characters, no real mystery, about the only positive thing was the sex scene descriptions but even those were still not great writing... I couldnt even stay interested to finish the series. You should feel some connection to the characters and a story line should not always be predictible, it should be exciting and intrigueing! I was honestly kind of burned out on reading for awhile with the let down of this purchase until I decided to curb my frustration of bad writing and try new authors and what did i find  summer ellis!!! ... a new writer only has a couple books as of yet but seems very promising!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|The book is very informative both for people who are new to bodybuilding and those who already have some base knowledge. It's short, simple, motivating and straight to the point which is exactly what a fitness book should do. The writer's theories are always backed with studies/examples, his attitude is very helpful and confident without being cocky and ignorant about other options which he wouldn't agree upon but are still mentioned. I recommend this to anyone interested in healthy and fitness, the book is a very fast read basically because I didn't want to put it down. I will definitely check out some of his other books

B0064NTZKI|5.0|This was incredible.  I've been waiting and wondering when there was ever going to be a comprehensive documentary on Woody Allen's work and this is it!  His body of work spans 40 years and I've never fully known how he got started or how he got into the next thing and so forth.  This documentary is jampacked with goodies and information that starts from the beginning and takes you on his journey of filmmaking and his process.  It ends just after Midnight in Paris which is considered his most successful film financially.<br /><br />I've always been a Woody Allen fan and have probably seen about 90% of his films.  I love his style, his humor and his look into the human condition.  He makes real films that have a kind of documentary quality to them as if you're eavesdropping on someone's life.  He meticulously shoots the greatest exterior shots whether that be in New York, Spain or France.<br /><br />Even Mariel Hemingway says yeah sure he's made some clunkers, but even in those films you still pull something poignant out of them.  Woody Allen is such an elusive character that you only hear about the rumors of his life or his filmmaking process.  In this documentary he actually talks throughout it and reveals his process.  These discs are packed with great goodies and information ranging from interviews with his longtime crew to the actors that have had the privilege of working for him.<br /><br />This isn't just a great documentary for a Woody Allen fan, but it's also a great set for those who are filmmakers themselves whether struggling or working in the business.  His ways are much different than typical Hollywood and his method has worked just fine for him 40+years.  He's not interested in whether someone likes him or doesn't or like his films or doesn't.  He simply enjoys making his movies and the rest is just icing on the cake.  He doesn't get involved in all the hoopla surrounding it.<br /><br />It is long, but I'm not complaining because it's all fascinating and watchable.  In fact, when I started watching disc 2 I thought I'd watch pieces of it and watch the rest at a later time.  I couldn't do that as I found it too entertaining and I was fixated on it so much I ended up just watching the rest of the thing.d watchable.

B001CP4VMU|5.0|I am focusing specifically on the UK Blu Ray edition of this movie. I really wanted just the first movie in my collection, but the US stand-alone disc is ridiculously overpriced at $49. There were also sellers who had this edition available to ship within the US, so I did not pay any international shipping costs. It is region free and it played without a hitch on my PS3. I've read reviews that say the quality is the same between this and the US version, so it's a win-win! I do not have the US version to compare it to, so I'd be interested if anyone out there finds this not to be the case.<br /><br />My main complaint is that the special features are not updated from the DVD Special Edition release, and they are not in HD. However, this is a great collection of special features for this movie. This is a better collection of features than any of the Nolan films have.<br /><br />The other nitpick is that the UK version has those annoying rating logos on the front of the cover. US movies usually have these on the back, so as to not soil the cover artwork. It's a minor problem, and it's not worth paying an extra $25+ to change it.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this edition.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I was a big fan of the Dark Shadows TV series and was excited to hear that Tim Burton was going to make the movie.  I thought if anyone can create the murky dark atmosphere of the TV series it would be him.  I along with others was disappointed to see the corny trailer that came out.  A comedy?  What?  Sacrilege. I decided to see the movie anyway making my peace with the fact that this was not going to be like the TV show.  I was able to separate the two and just look at it as its own piece and its own movie.<br /><br />Luckily by doing that, I found that I was entertained with this film and enjoyed every minute of it.  I suppose it did what its job was meant to do.  Entertain.  I also found that it wasn't nearly as comedic as they made it out to be with the trailer.  It was darker and more gothic and interesting.  The mood as in any Tim Burton movie was offbeat and not of this world.  Johnny Depp who did not look like himself made a great vampire coming to terms with being in the wrong century.  Michelle Pfeiffer was stunning and as always lit up the screen with her ferocious take on the reclusive dark matriarch.  The two surprises were Eva Green as Angelique Bouchard and Chloe Moretz who played Carolyn Stoddard. They both leapt gleefully into their characters prompting me to wonder who those two actors I'd never heard of were.<br /><br />Critiquing this movie as its own piece without comparing it to the TV series or Tim Burton's earlier work, I thought it was fun and entertaining.  Comparing it to the TV series or Burton's older films, then no it doesn't hold a candle and not his best work.  It was however better than Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, Alice in Wonderland and maybe even Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.  Sweeney Todd was a great movie, but I can only take so much of a movie where people are singing throughout it.  As great as Sweeney Todd was, I'm more likely to throw this Dark Shadows on instead.  Just my personal opinion.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I like the game it is just awesome it could not be more fun.I would definitely tell a friend and I would love to play all day.
B004CIIXC8|5.0|This movie is about a young girl, Mia, living in the slums of England with her dysfunctional family. She has a bad habit of getting into trouble and starting fights when a handsome man Connor (Michael Fassbender) finds his way into her mother's life. A tension exists between Connor and Mia but it is unclear at first what kind of tension this is. They strike up an unlikely relationship and Mia finds someone who will tell her she's worth more than the trouble she's so fond of causing. This movie really grabs you from the start, and isn't afraid to thrust the reality of the England slums in your face. Gritty sexuality and dysfunctional relationships abound, this movie is NOT afraid to be raw.<br /><br />It isn't so gritty that it is distasteful though, and I think anyone who's in the mood for an unconventional story will love this film. Nothing is expected and everything seems so realistic in this story. You'll really forget what's going on around you as you get wrapped up in the world of Mia.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|After recently viewing several Charlie Chaplin movies and being somewhat familiar with his life story, I was very interested in checking out Robert Downey's portrayal of the \\"Little Tramp.\\"<br /><br />All I can say is, he was beyond brilliant.  Every nuance,facial expression, body movement, personality characteristic, et al were captured to perfection.<br /><br />In my opinion, it was an Academy Award performance!

B000FC10MU|3.0|Neil Gaiman is one of the most talented storytellers we have today, and we are fortunate that he's passionate about telling good stories.  His writing of the Sandman comics was good, and his movie \\"Coraline\\" is a classic of children's horror.  What really impressed me about Neil Gaiman was his re-writing of the Beowulf legend for the movie re-make -- it was deep, disturbing, and utterly unforgettable.<br /><br />So I had high expectations coming into \\"American Gods,\\" and I was sorely disappointed.  \\"American Gods\\" is a bunch of Old World Gods (mainly the Nordic ones) in desperate search for New World believers, but this entire novel reads like a bunch of Gods (both Old World and New World) in desperate search of a plot.  It's a road story, and there's a lot of drifting, especially the abstract dreaming sort that Gaiman seems to revel in.<br /><br />Despite the failure of this book, I look forward to more novels by Neil Gaiman.  He seems to be endlessly creative, and more important he seems passionate about his art.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|Well I liked this book more than the other three because it got me less aggravated :). It also had a better plot that actually wasnt meaningless... I was pretty happy about the kinda sorta change in Bella and slightly Edward, they had been so dull the last three agonizing series. Anyways this is the everybody been waiting for if you were the ones who was irritated by Bella complaining how she wants to be a vampire.. (there is still some awful complaining though, I'd recommend  skipping that part XD) Anyways they decide to get marry and there is a little surprise for Bella and Edward: A BABY! I just hate the name they gave the baby Renesme.. Really? It sounds like a back disease. Im not going in further about this story except theres going to be a war with Volturi, I hoped someone died,but no.<br /><br />Good Job Meyer for not screwing up this time!

B007ATNHLI|4.0|We love this movie.  Our son wanted to see the new Men In Black movie but we insisted on having him watch the movies in order. So, we ordered the movie, got it in no time, got all set for our Friday movie night with our pillows and popcorn and then we hit play.  About 30 seconds into the opening credits the blu ray sound begins to start and stop.  Then the movie itself starts to stop and start.  We tried letting it run a little to see if it would work itself out, but it never did.  SO, this was my son's first experience with MIB.  We watched another movie instead and sent Men In Black back for an exchange.<br /><br />We received the new blu ray and set up our Men In Black movie night take two.  This time, to our relief, the movie starts fine and we are all enjoying all the aliens and Tommy and Will and then, at the pivotal scene at the end of the movie, the blu ray begins to start and stop.  Yes.  Our son has now watched the entire movie and can't see the finale!  We decided to watch it with the sound and picture going in and out because IT WAS THE VERY END OF THE MOVIE.  Really a huge drag.<br /><br />We sent that blu ray back and have received a THIRD one.  No one wants to watch it though because we all feel a little Men in Blacked out right now.<br /><br />This was not the drama we were looking for.  Needless to say, after all of this, Men Black 3 has come and gone in the theaters so we weren't able to take our son to see it.  I have to admit, I'm not feeling that great about getting it on blu ray.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought Fifty Shades of Grey was great! It was fun, quick, witty and definitely erotic. The characters were engaging and a bit flawed, but that was also part of the appeal.  This is absolutely a love story, and I loved that it wasn't a cookie cutter romance.  5 stars for me!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I am a big fan of personal development books and I think Darren really hit the nail on the head with this one.  Consistency over intensity will win out over the long haul when applied to anything you do in life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never been one to read a book with so much sex in it, but honestly it became addictive and I could not put it down.  I read all three books within a week.  I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next to Anastasia was going to encounter.  I have recommended it to many friends, including my 82 year old mother.  I even discussed it with a lady in Costco who picked it up to read the cover. I didn't know much about submission sex when I started reading it, but I do now. I love the way the author told the story.  It was very very good.
B008FOB124|5.0|It's been 16 years since the duo's last proper studio album.  Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry's influence on music is hard to measure, but Dead Can Dance's treatment of world music can be felt far and wide.  I'll admit, I was skeptical about the studio reunion ANASTASIS: after 16 years, how could the group possibly maintain their striking sound?  Dead Can Dance's style is easily aped, and I feared of an album that featured the band simply going through the motions.  I was wrong.  ANASTASIS is a fantastic return to form for the duo.<br /><br />Gerrard and Perry's vocal deliveries are strikingly different, and I feel the differences have grown wider only with timer.  Brendan Perry's croon sounds now like an old worn catcher's mitt -- it's a comfortable fit, and while it might have some rough edges, it feels lived-in and experienced.  Lisa Gerrard's voice, on the other hand, has a more traditionally elegaic quality to it; her singing often sounds transcendent.  The two vocalists duet only once on this album: the penultimate track \\"Return of the She-King,\\" which serves as one of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />The opening \\"Children of the Sun\\" serves as a highlight track on the record.  This atmospheric, Perry-sun track isn't just a good song for the band's album: it's a good song for the band's career.  It also points out what may be a defining characteristic for this record: these songs aren't as textured or layered as some of the band's earlier work.  This change, however, sees no real diminishing returns in terms of quality -- instead, it feels like the band is comfortable with their creations.  They have nothing to prove.  The songs of ANASTASIS sound much less like a band trying to imitate world music and more like a group profoundly inspired by traditional music from around the world.  This album transports listeners to Egypt, Turkey, Ireland, Russia, and beyond.  The orchestration of \\"Opium\\" is sweeping and hard to not get lost in.  The final track features one of Perry's best performances on the album in \\"All in Good Time.\\"<br /><br />While I don't feel like it quite reaches the heights of the group's earlier work, ANASTASIS is a phenomenal reunion album.  Long-time fans of Dead Can Dance should absolutely love this album; newcomers to the band would also do well to start listening here.  Much of what made Dead Can Dance so powerful is representative on this record.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B008S7ETBI Return of the She-King]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008S7ETV8 All in Good Time]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008S7EQC0 Children of the Sun]].\\"es one of Perry's best performances on the album in \\"All in Good Time.\\"<br /><br />While I don't feel like it quite reaches the heights of the group's earlier work, ANASTASIS is a phenomenal reunion album.

1843913720|5.0|This is a wonderful story, very well written that cleverly links the main character to some of the main historical events over his time on this earth.  The present day story is equally well told with comedy, emotion and fun.  Great book, similarities with Forrest Gump but better in my opinion.  Highly recommended.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen! Never a dull moment. I cannot wait until Season 6 to find out what happens.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is really fun and i make money really fast the only problem is that they don't give you enough space to start with and now I am having a problem saving money to get the land size bigger.
B005LAIGJQ|5.0|I don't think anything could quite have prepared me for this movie. For Eddie Murphey to have done this type of movie I think I am still stumped. It definitely makes you think about your time here on earth and to definitely choose your words alot more carefully. Just think. 1,ooo words is all you have to say before you die, that is 10 words to only 100 people. It does not seem fair when it is broken down like that does it. Imagine if our lives were really ran like  that. Its unthinkable for me to even fathom.
1422352862|5.0|I recommend this book to any true fan Of Poe. Never before did I realize the extent of greatness or length of work by Poe until now. It makes for a great read when life makes you sit in a waiting room. I received this book in \\"like new\\" condition. This will be something to proudly pass on to my son. Love to Poe. RIP
B001BR5NH6|5.0|I have always loved this movie, I remembering watching it as a child & now adding it to my movie collection as an adult is great. I love the fact that there are movies that are out there that I can sit down with my children and watch that I consider good, clean, fun humor. Whereas on the other hand a 13/14 year old would be watching for another reason. But anyhow it allows me the last bit of time I have that the kids still think your cool enough to hang around with, and that I truely am thankful for. That makes it the best movie ever. Thank you so much.

B008645YEE|3.0|While this soundtrack is a good addition to the trilogy, I feel it just doesn't have the depth of the previous two film soundtracks. Most of the tracks don't have that unique sound that the Dark Knight OST had. Begins my favorite was neat because of the titles and just overall fresh feeling I felt when I listened to it. Rises has some good tracks, but nothing that really stacks up as wonderful. I wouldn't call it a disappointment, but I do feel for the last soundtrack it just was not as great.
1442346272|5.0|The picture Issacson paints of Steve Jobs is like a fine painting.  Not photographic in its detail, but essentially accurate in capturing his essence!  When you finish the last page you feel like you've been introduced to the man and now know him in the most intimate ways.  You are not required to like or hate him, (I found myself experiencing both emotions during the books chapters) but you will form an opinion.  At times Jobs is a petulant child, spoiled and self centered.  At other times his vision is so compelling and his force of will so complete you marvel at his laser like intensity.<br /><br />Read this book if you desire to make a \\"Dent in the Universe\\"!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I fell in love with this book on many levels.  First, I thought the writing was exceptional and I loved how the author incorporated poetry to help tell an amazing story.  I enjoyed the character development and found both Lake and Will very likeable and relatable.  The emotion was raw and very real to me.  I also loved the supporting characters.  The book had me laughing, crying and rooting for Lake and Will from the beginning.  I read Slammed in two days because I simply could not put it down.  I probably would have read it in one day if my husband did not ask me to stop reading at 2:00 in the morning to get some sleep.  Finally, I thought the ending was very appropriate - as soon as I finished the book, I could not wait to hear the rest of Lake and Will's story so I immediately downloaded the second book which was also amazing.<br /><br />I just don't have anything bad to say about this book.  I adored every aspect of it and highly reccommend it to everyone!!

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Very well made and well done movie, all actors/actresses are excellent.  Read the book as well, and it stuck to that very well.  They left out the naked guy in the backyard story, which is a bit disappointing, but what are you gonna do.

B004LROUW2|4.0|As other reviwers have stated, the book starts slow and could be edited down by a few hundred pages.  That being said, although this was my first Murakami novel, it probably won't be my last.  I'll give at least one more a try.<br /><br />It was a slog getting through the first 100-150 pages of the book.  The characters were flat and boring and uninteresting, although I suspect that this is intentional.  Tengo and Aomame are supposed to be somewhat lifeless, at least while they still reside in Cat Town.  And the last few chapters, where the conclusion of the book appears inevitable, you just want Murakami to get to get it over with already.  If he was going for a feeling of suspense, he missed his mark and hit annoyance.<br /><br />I agree with the others who said that the book was often tedious and repititious. The continual referneces to Ushikawa's ugliness could have been reduced.  I mean, we get it.  He's ugly.  REALLY ugly.  A hideous troll doomed to walk the earth and frighten children.  A man whose looks are so repulsive it is amazing that he hasn't been picked up by a circus along the way and forced into a sideshow freak act.  Oh yeah, and did I mention that his head is misshapen and that he's ugly?  And really, we understand after about the 50th time, that Aomame is keeping the discovery of the two moons to herself and we get that *that* world is not *this* world.  Enough already.  Move on...<br /><br />Another reviewer suggested that some of these problems were due to the translation, specifically Philip Gabriel's contribution to the work.  However this reviewer also stated that he thought Book Three was better than One and Two.  So I think his translation argument is incorrect.  Jay Rubin translated Books One and Two and Gabriel translated Book Three.  Book Three is arguably the more interesting of the three books and I thought the conversations seems to flow more naturally in that book.<br /><br />Someone else warned that the sex in this book was \\"graphic\\".  I say, get out more.  The sex in this book is truly uninspiring and not in any way graphic.<br /><br />Since I've finished all of Pynchon's works (at least the ones published to date) I am looking for someone else to delve into.  Murakami might fit the bill.  I will give at least one more of his books a try.<br /><br />I would recommend 1Q84 to serious readers.<br /><br />Just a note:  I picked a bookmark out for this book before I even started reading it or knew what it was about.  It was a bookmark advertising the magazine The Economist.  The bookmark is all bright red with big, bold lettering that reads, \\"Never lose your place in the world.\\"  Amazingly apropos for this novel.  I'm leaving this bookmark in this book always.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|It's myb pleasure to finally see this classic opera done by famouse singers. I view also so pleasant. Very good experience to enjoy this opera, I will invite my best friends to watch with me again.
0312323867|5.0|A wonderful sequel to \\"something borrowed\\"!  Another great book by Emily Giffin.  She continues to give us readers a great group of characters that we begin to know and love as we follow them through life's ups and downs.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|So the first book was the best, the second had the plot and the third book is the resolution.  If you read the first two, the third is a must to find out what happens after the action.  Not the best but still easy to read.

B0079R8KXG|5.0|I absolutely love this case (including the Pink color). It is very, very sturdy and works great as a stand for my Fire. It is made of good leather, looks great and works just as they advertised. Took me a few minutes to figure out how to make it stand but once that was accomplished it was wonderful. It also is great for traveling as it is thick and gives my Kindle great protection from bumps and bangs. I would very highly recommend this product to anyone.
B000007ODX|4.0|This is a set of 2 CDs, containing the complete 21 Nocturnes by Frederic Chopin, played by Daniel Barenboim, the famous pianist and conductor, on Deutsche Gramophone.<br />Chopin published 18 of the Nocturnes during his life: 3 in op 9, 3 in op 15, 2 in op 27, 2 in op 32, 2 in op 37, 2 in op 48, 2 in op 55, and 2 in op 62. The remaining 3 Nocturnes were discovered after his death and were published posthumously. All Nocturnes are in a single movement, ten are in minor, and 11 are in major keys. Though they all have romantic feelings, they are not all in the same mood, ranging from dreamlike reverie, to more exuberant and emotional expressions.<br />The performance by Barenboim is excellent, however, since the recording was made in 1981, the quality of the sound is somewhat lacking in richness and depth. Nevertheless, it is a great buy.
B003PBB4ME|1.0|Don't mistakenly assume this thing is strong enough to hold a DSLR AND anything else. there is so much give in the handle that it vibrates and shakes as you shoot - not recommended. I would have paid $20 more for the handle to be made of any kind of metal.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I am among those who got the free version, loved it, and bought the premium within days! Not sure I needed all of the extra sounds with the premium but I wanted to support the development. Voting with dollars, and all that. :)<br /><br />Great features are:<br />1) Wide variety of sounds including nature and human-made (kids laughing, a dryer...) plus some very pretty melodies<br />2) Ability to create and save sound themes. You can add up to 10 sounds to a single theme and save it. You can also control the volume on each individual sound so the overall theme is very customizable.<br />3) Beautiful interface that is also easy to use and understand!<br />4) Timer!<br /><br />Bummer:<br />1) Looping on some of the rain sounds (yes, there are multiple!) is not quite perfect on my asus Transformer TF1.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Love it.<br />Would buy it again in a heartbeat.<br />Get yourself a relaxing treat.
B000SEI230|3.0|I like Nicholas Sparks and have read most of his books. I noticed that I had missed this one and read it in one day... Not because it's a \\"page turner\\" by any means, but a short book that is fairly predictable and somewhat unrealistic.  Since the book has been out for years, I won't go deeply into detail(which means \\"spoilers\\"), but in this instance, I would guess that the movie (with Mandy Moore) is better than the book.  It wasn't even that emotional because it was soooo predictable!  This is the only time that I felt one of Sparks' books to be a waste of time and money.

044655667X|4.0|Mickey Haller is back, in this sequel to The Lincoln Lawyer.  He's now representing people who are in the process of losing their homes to foreclosure, although I'm not sure how they can afford an attorney if they can't pay their mortgage.  Oh, well.  One of his former clients has now been charged with brutally murdering a bank executive, causing Haller to dive back into criminal law.  In this instance, movie rights are expected to cover Haller's fee when the case incites a media circus.  The bulk of the novel follows Lisa Trammel's trial, with lots of bumps and surprises along the way, all of which Haller twists to his and his client's advantage.  With conclusive DNA evidence on the murder weapon and the defendant's shoes, and an eyewitness who places Lisa near the scene of the crime, Haller pursues another angle--the victim's personal financial difficulties and a shady foreclosure processing company--in order to prove that his client was framed.  Most puzzling of all is how a 5'3\\" woman could bludgeon a standing 6'2\\" man on the top of the head--an anomaly that the prosecution fails to address.  The plot lacks the nail-biting timing of The Lincoln Lawyer, and the outcome and aftermath of the trial are a little predictable.  Even so, I still really enjoyed the ride, and the book's finale is very satisfying, with things playing out perfectly for Lisa Trammel and for Haller's career.  After all, what's Haller's overriding personal objective?  To get his ex-wife and daughter back.  I hope there's more to come.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|great game. just need friends online to complete some of the objectives....kinda lousy that you cant just do things yourself...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games trilogy was extremely entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoysa good story.  It was written with the teenager in mind as the target audience but I found that any audience would be throughly satisfied.  I completed the three books in one weekend and I am now looking forward to watching the film versions.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Enjoyed the DVD but disappointed in the 3D parts. Great special effects and a wonderful story. I would recommend this movie for fun entertainment.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|I was very excited to see this comprehensive look over the career of Woody Allen.  I have long been a fan of his work and even on the far off shores of New Zealand his clever, witty and erudite skills have wowed audiences for many years.  The documentary was a wonderful opportunity to hear him speak about his movie making, to hear others, who had worked with him, share their insights and to see clips of movies I have not seen for a long time or in fact probably never have seen as they were earlier in his career.  Fantastic to watch and I will be watching it all again!  Thanks
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have to say, I was a bit bored in the first 75-100 pages.  It seemed like any tv movie where a wife dies and the husband is the main suspect, but  the twist was a great surprise.  The next 25 pages were interesting and then again began to bore me then again there is another surprise.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I did like the 2 twists in the book, but I can't believe a movie is being made out of this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its dank. addicting and shows boobs everytime you win. well not the last one but still a great game!!  buy now
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Books are supposed to inspire thinking and allow you to explore other peoples thoughts and far away places. This book does none of that. The author must have written it while having an open copy of Twilight and reality TV shows on for inspiration. The novel has the completely unrealistic characters readers cannot relate with, the bare bones plot has you questioning everyone's nonsensical motives while highlighting on the worst of gender stereotypes society has placed. No young girl should read this book and the author is clearly an uneducated, untalented writer who simply saw the success of plotless, sappy, and unhealthy romances in Twilight and said \\"Me too!\\". Don't read it. Don't buy it. Don't recommend it to anyone. Don't even talk about it. Its a travesty of a novel and shouldn't even be called literature since reading it will likely just lower your IQ to that of the person who probably only used Twilight and a thesaurus as references.
B0086700CM|5.0|Nice app for Killing time. Easy mindless gameplay that keeps you both frustrated and entertained. You basically run around and try not to fall or trip on anything.
0061765236|2.0|Heading off to a weekend far from screens of any kind -- tv, computer, cell phone, etc. -- I picked up a couple of beach reads from authors I'd never tried before. Second up, Jodi Picoult's The Pact. Though I hadn't read any of Picoult's novels, I had read about her in newspaper and magazine stories. From what I gathered, her brand is built on realistic novels about contemporary families caught up in agonizing ripped-from-the-headlines problems. In this case, that problem is an apparent suicide pact between teen lovers that winds up with the girl dead, the boy on trial for murder, and the teens' parents -- once best friends -- estranged. Picoult is a decent writer who provides the details needed for a sense of place in just about every scene, develops her characters with mostly believable details, creates enough suspense to keep the plot boiling, and generally moves her story along briskly. She hit only one truly off note for me early on: Why would the wife of a wealthy surgeon start a business that consists of standing in line -- at the DMV, at Ticketmaster, etc. -- which I figure is a bit too menial for most doctors' wives? And why would a woman willing to do such menial work then try to pull rank -- \\"people like us\\" and \\"can't we pull strings\\" -- when her son is arrested for murder? About halfway through the book, another problem arose: I didn't buy the girl's reason for killing herself. Part of the problem is that there isn't clearly one thing -- there's a couple of things -- but they simply didn't mesh for me into a believable reason for suicide. However, it's also true that teens sometimes commit suicide for unbelievably trivial reasons, so I gave Picoult the benefit of the doubt. But my big problems with this book came in the courtroom drama that ends the book. Again, Picoult's claim to fame is realistic contemporary stories, but the courtroom scene is unadulterated BS from first to last. All jury trials start with voir dire: selection of the jurors. Not Picoult's trial. On Day One, the jury is sitting right there ready to hear the evidence, and there is no mention of the often lengthy and always critical process of jury selection. The trial begins, correctly, with the prosecution, although having the prosecutor point to the accused in the courtroom is another piece of theatrical BS that would never happen. The first witness is the police detective but the early question -- \\"Did you determine a cause of death?\\" -- is crap. The autopsy, which is performed by an MD, determines the cause of death. At most, the cop can speculate about what caused the injury -- stabbed, shot, strangled, etc. And then the biggie: on cross-examination, the defense attorney establishes that this case is only the second homicide the detective has ever worked on. Hooey! Homicides in small towns are investigated by experienced investigators who are overseen by experienced prosecutors in a special outfit that's generally known as something like \\"major crimes unit\\" and is generally under the command of the state police. Picoult lives in New Hampshire and has set her story in New Hampshire. As an  adult citizen of New Hampshire, she should know this. As a novelist whose brand is built on realistic contemporary stories ripped-from-the-headlines, she MUST know this. She doesn't or she doesn't care. Either way, the many courtroom goofs show that she can't be trusted to get things right in her novels, so I won't bother to ever read another.ult's trial.

I genuinely don think she ever cares about her music anymore. shes so concerned about appealing to the masses that she now sound like taylor swift. what happened to the girl who woke up in vegas?

B0001HLVS2|5.0|As a former naval officer I remember sitting through a showing of the movie \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\" in our leadership classes.  The movie was used to demonstrate contrasting leadership styles. \\"Master and Commander,\\" if it had been available all those decades ago, would have been an excellent movie to demonstrate the the calm, calculating thought, often accentuated with a smile, that is required in a leader when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  Russel Crowe's Jack Aubrey demonstrates that trait beautifully.<br /><br />Leadership aside though, the movie's attention to seafaring detail is phenomenal.  Although I was part of the modern Navy, the DTS soundtrack of the movie captures the constant intrusions of sounds at sea; all the squeaks, clanks, snores, footsteps, splashes, wisps and howls of the wind are an ever present character in the film.  Of particular note was the use of the \\"chipset,\\" a simple device that used knotted line to accurately give the ship's speed in \\"knots.\\"  Also, though easy to miss, there is a scene while the ship is attempting to \\"round the Horn\\" at the tip of South America, where it shows a sailor using the \\"head,\\" the nautical term for the toilet on the ship.  If you look carefully as the camera pans from the front to the back of the ship, you'll see a sailor with his pants around his ankles sitting on a holed plank off the front or \\"head\\" of the ship.  For obvious reasons the head was placed as far as possible from the captain's quarters, the area at the far aft (back) of the ship.<br /><br />Finally, the acting in the movie is exceptional, the battle scenes chaotic, and the cannonball shots impressive. You almost want to duck as the cannonshots approach and tear through the ship.  Whether you buy the DTS encoded DVD or Blu-ray, the battle scenes will impressively exercise your home theater system.

1475143389|5.0|This book is written thoughtfully and has some great tips in enhancing your figure and planning your workout sessions.<br />I found it to be a nice, to-the-point brief read. I appreciate how the author lays out exactly what his Do's and Don'ts are for working out and dieting.<br /><br />I have only begun a workout regime following this book (albeit a little modified to fit my schedule as a new parent), but without a doubt I feel as though if I can follow the author's advice I can acheive gains that he talks about. But don't think of this as any sort of snake oil sell --- his regime and workout/diet details are not for the faint of heart! If you are someone who has never done any sort of fitness routine or diet planning before you may be surprised at how much time and effort is needed to be put into both. Actually, from this book and other sources, it would appear that the diet requires the most effort, far more than lifting.<br /><br />A few drawbacks I found for people completely new to fitness is that sometimes the book doesnt really detail what a particular exercise is. But the author provides plently of resources (internet links) and even without those it is pretty easy to find videos of each exercise online. But it would have been nice if this was a \\"one-stop\\" reference book for a workout regime.<br /><br />Above all, this author really cares about people getting into shape. His contact information is listed at the end of the book. I e-mailed him with a few questions of mine, not really knowing if I would get a response back or not. A hour or so later I got a long, thoughtful response with answers to all of my questions, and encouragement to ask more. This is alone is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for those looking to improve their bodies - but dont be afraid of a little hard work!

B0088RQ4TI|4.0|Even though bits and pieces of John Carter are reminiscent of previously produced sci-fi movies, in general a unique story unfolds as you watch it. Expect good characters which are well portrayed and great special effects.  Do not expect to be able to predict the turn of events.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I generally find that I have a high degree of skepticism when it comes to Amazon authors that I've never heard of before. However, there was so much positive press for this author and this book, I figured I'd give it a go.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give this a spin. It's absolutely worth the cash and the time.

1400044162|2.0|Half of a yellow sun is written to entice a western audience by balancing the life of a poor houseboy with the eminence of a university professor in an emergent Nigerian society that had just gained independence. The characters are obviously fleshed out to maintain a western curiosity by casting the struggles of an African boy from an all too expected impoverished village against that of a western-educated middle class, who behave more western than African actually.<br /><br />My problem with a lot of Nigerian writers at this moment is that I keep reading the same themes on and on, from one to the next: From Achebe's groundbreaking work, through Ben Okri's atmospheric and dreamy magical realism to Chimamanda Ngozi's forced character-driven tales, about juju, pounding fufu and tying wrappers, breaking cola nuts and sharing them and pouring libation and constantly burrowing from Achebe's innovative infusion  of the local Nigerian languages into English writing, and so on. We can write wonderful stories that have nothing to do with the white man or colonialism and so on. We can write philosophical fiction too. But again, this novel takes off on the same old course of constantly blaming our woes on the white man. It can be argued that these are elements that make up the Nigerian society, but as I have spent the past three months reading a bunch of Nigerian writers, the repetition has gone under my skin.<br /><br />Also, I find the first few chapters of this book too repetitive to keep my interest. Yes we know the boy is from the village, but the writer exaggerates this, by constantly having to remind us about this fact, of how everything is so different for the boy and she seems to undermine the reader's ability to add one and two together. This made me to wonder whether it was because she was trying too hard to capture the mind set of a western audience or what? As an African, this became quickly obvious to me without the continuous emphases. I actually felt like I wasbeing sold to the fact that people who live in African villages are stupid.<br /><br />Also I found it difficult to understand why the young man would be jealous of master having a mistress. I could understand some of it, but I didn't feel that there was any threat presented, say from master's point of view to give him a reason to fear, since master did nothing but being nice to him. It just wasn't convincing to me and at this point, I have put down the book.<br /><br />Perhaps the historical events in the book light up the story, but I see this as a long and tedious haul that would probably take me the next year to finish and some how I regret buying the book, if not it teaches a few things on how to sell an African story to a western audience.<br /><br />For me, there is no way she could be matched with Achebe's wit and originality, especially the minimalistic potency of his writings. It is simply not possible. But I give her 2 stars because some of her metaphors are outstanding and you get an impression that she has done her research on the topic remarkably well.
0307951529|5.0|As an entrepreneur , I really enjoyed this book and I now recommend it to any friend or colleague who wants to pursue something new. The biggest strength in $100 Startup is the way Chris frames the opportunity to start your own business - through examples & stories, he makes something that can be completely daunting seem approachable & doable.<br /><br />In my experience, getting over that initial paralysis and just getting going is the most important step.  To help readers achieve this, $100 Startup offers simple tools and asks basic questions that allow you to create your own path forward. I think $100 Startup is an important read for anyone who wants to make their idea a reality.<br /><br />- Allie (weBike ... webikedoyou.com)
B005LAIHGI|1.0|This is the least funny comedy I've seen lately. Borat was awesome, but everything this guy has done since is utter garbage. Not funny, not good or even acceptable in any way. But go ahead and waste your money on this anyway.
B00005V9IK|5.0|This movie is what started it for me as a Will Smith fan. It shows he ability to be an action star and him and Jeff make a good combo. plus it add a berief felling of strong in a moment of trial because of our heros.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was last month's pick for my book club. I might not have necessarily read it otherwise. I used to read a lot of psychological suspense, but have moved on to other genres.<br /><br />Wow. This was definitely an interesting read. What a weird couple. Enjoyed the story.<br /><br />Wasn't happy with the ending at all, and was a little ticked off. I felt cheated.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|As usual, Steve covers a lot of ground here....everything from big gospel-choir Blues, Broadway showtunes, Irish traditional music as well as a huge dose of his own incomparable style.<br /><br />I get the same 'return to form' feeling as I did with Satriani's 'Black Holes and Wormhole Wizards'. I hadn't been really wowed by Joe's previous few releases until Wizards took up all my listening time for a month or two. Similarly, I didn't find a great deal on Real Illusions that I kept returning to, but 'Story of Light' is fantastic.<br />I've listened to it about a half dozen times all the way through so far, so I'll add my early impressions. I'm giving this 5 stars no problem for the overall consistency and the many WOW moments. Overall, very melodic and creative but it'll take many more listens to hear all the rest of the stuff Steve has crammed into each track.<br /><br />The Story of Light: Opens up big and euphoric, has a great melody and solo.<br /><br />Velorum: Massive opening riff, but settles into a gorgeous melody. Lots of light and dark passages. Steve's blazing on this.<br /><br />John the Revelator: First surprise of the disc, starts off with scratchy old vinyl blues track, enter huge riff...then Beverly McClennan (??) just kills on the vocal, awesome. Reminds me of the choir before the Cutting Heads duel from 'Crossroads'.<br /><br />Book of the Seven Seals: I've read many interviews where Steve is raving about West Side Story and Leonard Bernstein, so I guess this is what comes out when he writes a Broadway tune. Perfectly sequenced after Revelator, and I'm surprised how much I like it, not being a fan of showtunes.<br /><br />Creamsicle Sunset: Little bit of 'Call It Sleep' and a little bit of 'Tender Surrender', beautiful melody.<br /><br />Gravity Storm: Huge and sludgey, does feel like gravity is out of control and pulling heavier than normal.<br /><br />Mullach a' tSi: Traditional Irish tune, given the Seventh Song treatment. Similar to 'Whsperinga Prayer', which is probably no coincidence. The Seventh Songs never disappoint, nobody does the ballad better.<br /><br />The Moon and I: First heard this on Vai Tunes, and thought it was great then. Nice moody melody and Steve's soloing is extraordinary on this one.<br /><br />Weeping China Doll: Another huge opening riff, some soaring melodies and great leads.<br /><br />Racing the World: My favorite track, total knockout. Races along, brilliant melody and Steve is just out of this world here. I'll have this on infinite repeat.<br /><br />No More Amsterdam: Duet with Aimee Man, great song.<br /><br />Sunshine Electric Raindrops. Bright, sunny closing track...perfect end to a great album.<br /><br />This is a more focused effort than some of his recent work. It's similar to 'Alien Love Secrets' in that there's a lot of relatively straightforward songs, over which he plays some absolutely stunning guitar. His playing is top class all the way through, exhilarating stuff.
B008DVJO8C|2.0|If this is your first ITM album, you'll like it or love it. You probably heard the new single and want more of it. You're gonna get it. If this is your fourth ITM album, and you weren't happy with the second or third, pass on it. You won't find anything new on here, as most of the songs are the same tempo and lack originality. Brink's voice is strong as ever, but she's not the only \\"instrument\\" in the band.

B001IF5YLQ|2.0|Although the product description specifically says that this is the Apple Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter, the product received is not genuine. It came in packaging that is designed to resemble the genuine Apple packaging. The adapter itself is also distinctly different from the adapter distributed directly from Apple; it is of notably lower quality. The fake adapter is in fact indistinguishable from the many $5 adapters scattered through Amazon, although it is sold for $30, the same price as the genuine article. The only reason this product does not get one star is that it is currently functional, although given the reliability of many of the counterfeits, that may not be the case for long.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I had never heard of this movie before, let alone seen it, and when my boyfriend suggested it I was pretty wary -- I'm not a big Cher fan (and neither is he), so I took it with a grain of salt that perhaps others' performances overruled her in this film. Not. I was genuinely impressed by her acting in this movie. And Sam Elliott ohhhh don't even get me started. LOVE him. Anyway, it wound up being a very good movie -- I really enjoyed the performance of the boy playing Rocky. A definite recommendation!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a really good story to read. I liked how the author portrayed Ender's personality: very timid and unsuspecting in the beginning but he becomes more of a force to be reckoned with as he's thrust into adult situations well beyond his understanding. As a fan of the sci-fi genre, I like how the author describes the settings of the battle school. The only negative comment I could say (and the reason for the lack of a fifth star in the rating) is that the author chooses uncommon unisex names for his characters, so it is sometimes hard to follow who is who and get an image in your mind of the characters.

0375846735|5.0|I enjoyed the first book a lot.  The ending of the second book left me feeling empty and I wasn't sure if I should read the third one.  I am extremely glad I did.  I loved it very much.  My daughter is 9yrs old now, but I will get these books for her when she is a little older.  The ending was sad but it was a great end to an amazing story.  (unlike an extremely stupid ending to an amazing story that left me angry and it was a complete waste of time - Christopher P's Eragon...)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this and the fact that its free!  this would be great to play for your child for nap or bed time. so many sounds to pick from and you can pick up to 10 at a time to layer and make your own mix! love love love love it!
B0072KZ0Z6|4.0|This isn't normally the type of stuff saved in my DVR, but I happened to see the first few minutes of an episode and decided to give the series a chance. Believe me, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Jessica Day (played by Zoey) is this quirky, unique girl that likes to stand by her principles and make the people around her happy. She moves in with 3 guys, each of whom brings a different personality to the table. And yeah, these characters face some typical issues people in their late 20s/early 30s face--significant others, exes, and exes of significant others, to name a few--but I'm still interested in the story, and I'm still up for surprises. Basically, the premise of the show isn't extremely original, but it's great if you're looking for a simple, fun new sitcom.<br /><br />I like that even though this series focuses on the lives of these four new roommates, the story doesn't just revolve around them. For example, they added Cece as a regular character after the first couple of episodes.

B004LWZW7O|5.0|Great orignial story and really can be translated into today's \\"working class\\" world! I thought it was well acted and sent a strong message about the way our society is headed! How many times have you or I said; \\"There's never enough time in the day . . . .\\"? It is a PG-13 film but the concepts it envokes may be a little above a 13 year-old's mentality. Justin Timberlake delivered a convincing role in the lead. Good movie, entertaining,good ending!
B004XS97KO|5.0|Hi, i'm very new to Doctor Who.  Kept hearing about it and thought i would check it out.  Love this show.  Particularly seasons 5-6.  I find these seasons to be of much better quality than the others.  A good way to get acquainted with the show.

B000QRIGLC|4.0|Even though the language isn't perfect, and the word choice could be improved and the book could've been more efficient (not necessarily by taking out information, just present it a little better) I still think this may be one of my new favorite books!! I also wish that the section on the training was a little bit shorter...<br /><br />But once you get into the book, maybe 100pgs in, it's an absolute page turner! This terrible event is recounted with such detail I was almost afraid for my own life!!! (ok no, not really) I cried, I laughed, but most of all, it truly makes you appreciate out troops and all they do for us!<br /><br />This isn't normally my cup of tea, but I'm glad someone took this book, and literally put it into my hands and said, \\"Read!\\" It is by far an unbelievable story of bravery, strength and heroism! (& the true surprise is, who in his life demonstrates these qualities to Marcus!<br /><br />Please read! It's amazing!
1466401885|5.0|This book great! Keeps you on your toes, I could not put it down and I finished it in 3 days just because I forced myself to put it down. The relationship between Abby and Travis gets you emotionally involved, one minute im anxious the next im frustrated and just a bunch of emotions. I love how  the author throws in the twists and unexpected turns and the sexy scenes are unlike Fifty shades or bared to you which makes it very different from those books. I was so nervous for how the book was going to end but I am beyond pleased && im looking too forward to read Travis' POV in \\"Walking Disaster.\\" For all you hopeless romantics that love reading into complicated yet beautiful relationships this book is def for you. The love these two have is unconditional and the audience is able to relate to these two! Read it && love it!
B00846REIS|1.0|I picked this book up because of the popularity of the 50 Shades trilogy.  Who doesn't enjoy a good love story and great sex?  But Bared to You fell short on the love and the sex.  It was not in the least bit believable.  It is hard not to hate both main characters or understand how the fell for each other so quickly as there is no background or character development.  The writing was terrible and some of the the things that came out of the mouths of these characters was comical.  I almost expected to see \\"LOL\\" written in the text.  Don't waste your time or your money.

B005974CNA|1.0|Its painfully obvious from listening to this album that the band misses Mike Portnoy, not just on the drum throne but in the production room.  I really wanted to like this album but after almost a year later, I just can't get into it.  I've tried to re-listen to it on several occasions and its without a doubt the most punchless, bland DT album ever.<br /><br />What jumps out at me is the lack of quality song writing , both lyrically and musically.  This something that MP would've validated in the production chair.  There just isn't one good song on the album.  So many people here have compared this album to Images and Words.... that just isn't true.  In, fact, that's an insult to that particular album.  The biggest complaint I have is the scaled back sound of the album, whether it was done purposely is not known, but one thing I always expected from a DT album is that \\"gut punch\\" you get from hearing one of their songs.  However, that is sadly missing from this CD.  Again, this is something MP would've corrected in the producer's chair.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this just a poor effort from one of the best prog bands ever.  Lets hope they get it right (by hiring a real producer) with their next effort.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read this book after hearing all the hype about it..... I was SO not impressed.  The storyline is nothing new....boy meets girl, one of them has an issue (in this case her inexperience and his predilections) they get together and break up over issue, and ultimately get back together.....sound like every romance book you have read in the last 10 years?  The only difference is that his issue is s&m.....which seems to be why everyone raves over this book........<br /><br />Sorry, but I was seriously underwhelmed when I read the trilogy (yes I read all three to confirm my opinion).  This is a mediocre romance novel at best...the twist  being the \\"kinky stuff\\" which was uncomfortable to read in many situations....  I am certainly not old or prudish, but  spanking for the pain.....doesn't do it for me....if you take away the kinky bits, this is a very boring romance novel...<br /><br />I am a wide and voracious reader, but I really think a book that glamorizes beating up women, no matter what they say , is abhorrent.  I don't have a problem with handcuffs or other \\"bits and pieces\\" for fun but  this book goes further than that, in that it is saying that's it's acceptable to beat up women when they don't do what you want, it is saying its ok to punish women who speak up.....I am truly appalled that this has made the bestsellers list, and that Hollywood stars are lining up to play the characters in a movie....<br /><br />To me this is a bad mills and boon story with kinky undertones, and unfortunately it's the kinky undertones that sell it....<br />If you have any respect for women, don't buy this book, as it will just keep it up there on the bestsellers list

0345803485|5.0|This book is not just about sex, as friends and reviews led me to believe.  It pulls you in and allows you a voyeuristic perspective of sadomasichism and how the lines between participants become skewed.
0345803485|1.0|The writing in this book is very poor.  The author seems to have a very limited vocabulary and is redundant in words used throughout the book, let alone the book lacking any kind of plot.  I recommend this book to no one.  I am so sorry I wasted my money purchasing this book.  My sister, friends and I are in a book club and will have a book burning celebration to get rid of this book.
0345440927|2.0|I got this book after multiple people said it was invaluable. I found the tone to be sarcastic and judgmental.  I was also confused by some of the contradictory advice: she says she's appalled by how many people let their toddlers dominate the home and call the shots. Then, when apparently asked how to deal with a kid who throws food, she replies, \\"He's not hungry, Luv. Let him play for a half hour and then try again.\\"  What are you doing tonight?

B004GJYR7I|5.0|Cary grant and Katherine hepburn at their Best! Cary Grant, a paleontologist, is finishing a complete skeleton of a dinosaur. He unfortunately crosses paths with a hilariously flighty young girl (Hepburn) and it is then touch-and-go, in the funniest way imaginable! She really loves him, and finds every way possible to make him notice her, not stopping at pretending to be attacked by a \\"wild\\" leopard, stealing his clothes, stealing a CAR, and thoroughly embarrassing him in front a big donor to the museum... You will be rocking with laughter through the entire film!

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I've enjoyed Analog Man so much I went and purchased The James Gang's first album Yer' Album--one of the few Joe Walsh works I haven't owned on CD or vinyl.  It is highly unusual to hear an artist who recorded amazing things out of the gate at age 21 (search the internet for The Who's respect of Walsh) and can still put out a career highlight at age 64. There are prominent and faint echoes of his 70s solo work including a cut or two that would sound great on an Eagles album.  But just as his time with the Eagles didn't define his career, Joe is still a solo legend:  guitar, wit, and swag.  His lyrics and playing can STILL make you grin. Yet there are beautiful anchors to the present such as the poignant tone in \\"Family\\"--nice to see an artist reconcile the wreckage of stag years that drag on too long with the never too late comfort and integrity of his caring family.  He captures something fun and carefree on \\"High Roller\\" and you have to hear \\"Lucky That Way\\" to know why Joe's attitude has aged so well:  'If you just act like you know what you're doing...' What a musician and showman.  So glad he made this album....

0684824906|2.0|Plagiarism controversy<br />In 2002, The Weekly Standard determined that her book, The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, used without attribution numerous phrases and sentences from three other books: Time to Remember, by Rose Kennedy; The Lost Prince, by Hank Searl; and Kathleen Kennedy: Her Life and Times, by Lynne McTaggart.[15]<br />McTaggart weighed in, \\"If somebody takes a third of somebody's book, which is what happened to me, they are lifting out the heart and guts of somebody else's individual expression.\\"[16] Goodwin admitted that she had previously reached a large \\"private settlement\\" with McTaggart over the issue. She wrote in Time:<br />Fourteen years ago, not long after the publication of my book The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, I received a communication from author Lynne McTaggart pointing out that material from her book on Kathleen Kennedy had not been properly attributed. I realized that she was right. Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, I failed to provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim, having assumed that these phrases, drawn from my notes, were my words, not hers. I made the corrections she requested, and the matter was completely laid to rest--until last week, when the Weekly Standard published an article reviving the issue. The larger question for those of us who write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen.[17]<br />Slate magazine also reported that there were multiple passages in Goodwin's book on the Roosevelts (No Ordinary Time) that were apparently taken from Joseph Lash's Eleanor and Franklin, Hugh Gregory Gallagher's FDR's Splendid Deception, and other books, although she \\"scrupulously\\" footnoted the material. Furthermore, The Los Angeles Times reported similar circumstances concerning her book The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys.[18][19] The allegations of plagiarism caused her to leave her position as a guest pundit on the PBS NewsHour program.[20]<br />[edit]
0156027321|1.0|I read this book from start to finish and I feel I should get a medal for that because this is the most overblown dullest book I have read in a very long time.  After reading this book I read some of the reviews but I wonder if we read the same book. This book got off to a good start but by the time Pi got involved with the tiger and other ridiculous things the interest and credibility dropped page by page. The plot such as it was simply didn't spark any interest and certainly didn't make any sense given that he was living with a tiger.  Apparently the critics and English teachers love this book for its symbolism and philosophies -- sort of like the English Patient and similar nonsense.  In fact Life of Pi sort of seems similar to Hemingway's \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" although Hemingway is a better writer and his story was a lot more interesting.  By the time I got to the ending I was definitely through with Pi.  I felt the ending was obvious and did not redeem the book or make it more interesting.  I thought this was a poorly written and pretentious book.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Ever since I saw the media releases for this blaster I have been stockpiling 18-round clips to fill up the rack on the bottom of this blaster, and I have to tell you that while you will get hand cramps emptying it as fast as you possibly can you won't care. While the Hail-Fire is not as accurate as say, the Retaliator or the Rampage it doesn't have to be and that's not what it was designed for. The purpose is contained right there in the title: Hail... Fire: As many darts in the air as possible for as long as you've got ammo. Others have said that this blaster is unweildy and awkward, now while that may be so for a younger user, the profile is MUCH smaller than the photos would suggest it is actually more compact (lengthwise anyways) than the retaliator with its barrel extension. In actuality I found the Hail-Fire a little on the small side.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The hailfire more than lives up to its purpose as a suppressive weapon and with 8, 18-round clips you are going to be suppressing for quite a while. The ranges are more than perfect for indoor work and sufficient for your average Nerf war in the outdoors. Possibly even extendable with voltage-modding. The size is a welcome surprise, 100+ rounds in a compact portable frame is fantastic. Try linking 4 ammo belts together for a vulcan and see how much more unwieldy it gets.<br /><br />The not so good:<br />I can't bring myself to write 'bad' here. There is nothing really wrong with the blaster but it could certainly stand to be a little more sturdy. With 8 18-round clips in the rack pulling the advance handle feels a little rickety and a release button for each clip would help with reload times but these are cosmetic. If you need to reload before the match is over then you're probably doing something wrong. Yes with 8 18-round clips the blaster looks a bit funny, but let's focus on the important thing here: 144 rounds.

0307744434|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me and I`m forever grateful (and recommending it to other people).<br /><br />This book is not some easy romance or a light read you can start in the afternoon and be done with in the evening. This is a demanding book. It steals your thoughts and doesn`t leave you even when you`re done with it. But that is what I love about it. After having read so much fluff, it was nice to finally read a book that tickled my brain just a little bit.<br /><br />You are thrown into a story where you`re not spoon-fed with explanations and character descriptions. On the contrary, some of the characters and actions can seem hard to understand. Magic is involved and I ended up accepting the book`s premises and loving them.<br /><br />This is not a book if you just want some fluff for a quick read but it`s certainly the book for you if you want something more - something different. You`ll love the intricate world that`s been weaved and the characters you meet. I know I did!

It's one of the best for sitting back with a bowl of popcorn and being entertained and not offended by gratuitous sex and violence. Why don't they make movies like this anymore?

B004CJB0CM|5.0|I must confess, I am addicted to workout videos. Every new \\"workout gimic\\" that comes out, I have to try it.

If you want to get whipped into shape in a short amount of time, she is THEE way to go.<br /><br />I have done the 30DS probably 5 times and the results are always astounding. You have to commit to doing the workouts at least 4-5 per week and make better food choices.<br /><br />Now I will say the weight doesn't drop off for me; however, the inches I lose whenever I finish the 30 days are awesome. My abs have always been a REAL issue but after doing her video, I start to see some definition. I always go down a pants size too.<br /><br />So, if you're wondering if you should purchase this video, please do...you will not be disappointed.  30DS is also a great introduction to all her other videos...yessss, I have them all.
B008AGOL9W|5.0|Many of the die-hard fans will want to go for the deluxe edition but if you're just dipping your toes in the water is this the one for you? Well I say yes.<br /><br />QE2 was actually my introduction to Mike Oldfield's music and I quickly became addicted to it, saving up to buy his previous releases. The beauty of much of his early work is that it is complex and challenging yet remains completely accessible, QE2 perfectly fits into that bracket. Right from start to finish this album is full of tunes that you won't be able to resist whistling or humming to yourself, you'll be desperate to return and listen again.<br /><br />Let's not forget that Oldfield is a superb musician and this album sees him in guitar-hero mode, with some blistering fret-work.<br /><br />If this isn't your first visit to QE2 and you're here for the remastering; is it noticeable? My last copy on CD was purchased in the 1980's and this release is a definite improvement. By comparison my old copy sounds brittle and too trebley, this release is warm and reveals layers of music I hadn't noticed before, you wouldn't want to miss out on that would you?!<br /><br />I've gotten into the habit of telling Oldfield fans about a young whipper-snapper by the name of Andrew Taylor who has released an album called Mohribold (google it). If you like Oldfield you'll love Mohribold! There are some QE2-esque moments as well as some clear Ommadawn and Hergest Ridge influence but he's got his own style too. Maybe he's one to watch out for since Oldfield has called for an instrumetnal rock renaissence after his Olympics appearance.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book (Kindle edition) becasue I heard everyone talking about \\"50 Shades\\".  I read about 25% of the book and put it down for the last time.  It is very poorly written and it is trash.  It glorifies indulging in weird sex, in a strange relationship and it belittles the intelligence of women.  I heartily recommend you use it to start a fire in your fireplace.
6304884419|5.0|This was a gift for my mother so I cannot rate the quality of the DVD, however shipment was fast and very easy.
B00862KPDQ|5.0|I'll try and keep this simple. Is this a noticeable remaster? Well actually yes. I always felt that Platinum had some uncomfortable very trebley moments such as those Bells during Woodhenge amongst others (this was a wider problem in the recording industry at the time and into the 80's). Now we are given a warm well balanced yet still crisp sounding Platinum.<br /><br />Are the extras worth it? A resounding yes. On paper North Star 2012 has the makings of a disaster but Oldfield pulls it off with aplomb. I've always been a fan of the Philip Glass original and this version adds something back of that choral quality whilst also giving us something contemporary and groovy but in a very good way. The live studio session didn't sound at all as I expected, it's very interesting and enjoyable but I presume one for the fans. You'll probably have Blue Peter by now anyway but it does sound very rasping and concise here. Disc 2 is a very energetic live Wembley set recorded in 1980. North Star again has something of the original re-inserted and there is lots of alternative guitar widdling from the maestro.<br /><br />So on reflection a worthwhile release, buy it and rediscover you're love of a classic album and when you've done that you really must listen to an album called Mohribold by Andrew Taylor (google it!). Since discovering his music I've been raving about it to anyone who'll listen, especially Oldfield fans. This whiper-snapper has clearly soaked up Ommadawn, Hergest Ridge, etc.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|everything went well with transaction and delivery. The book was for a project and it was a great way to purchase.
B0087ZFHBM|5.0|What you really want to know is whether it's worth forking out a little extra and buying the deluxe version of QE2. Well yes I think it is.<br /><br />The majority of the bonus content that comes with the deluxe edition is a live set recorded in Essen in 1981. By this point Oldfield had trimmed down his enormous band and they had had time to 'bed in' and work on their sound. The result is energetic, rocky, melodic and utterly brilliant!!! Some of the heavier, faster pieces like Mirage and Conflict are let of the leash and seem to have more impact in their live setting. Ommadawn is given an airing here too which is absolutely stunning, replete with QE2 style vocoder and fiddle in the climax.<br /><br />It's always seemed sad that many people view Oldfield primarily as a keyboardist, he's always been lumped into that Jarre/Vangelis bracket. If you want that view challenged this is the LP to listen to because he is in true guitar hero mode here with more runs, pull-offs and fret-wizadry than you can shake a stick at.<br /><br />This is full value for your money too because the live disc is full to the rafters.<br /><br />I can see the 2012 reworking of Sheba (called \\"Shiva\\") one to divide the fans, Oldfield basically sings over the top of it, but actually it's great, though if it's not to your taste well nevermind it's only one track, you get all that great live stuff too that you'll love.<br /><br />The remastering of the album proper ticks all the right boxes too. It's warm and concise. I for one heard layers of the music I hadn't noticed before and I've been listening to QE2 since it was first released.<br /><br />I've gotten into the habit of telling Oldfield fans about a young whipper-snapper by the name of Andrew Taylor who has released an album called Mohribold (google it).

B008CJ0JPC|5.0|I burst into spontaneous applause at the end of this film because there is not a film out there like it, none. The truth may well be out there, but films of this calibre aren't.

B008AGOL9M|5.0|The die-hard fans will want to go for the deluxe edition but if you just want a remaster or are dipping your toes in those Oldfield waters, is this for you?<br /><br />Platinum isn't definitive Oldfield but I do know many people were introduced to the man's music with this LP. His highly melodic guitar style is very evident here especially on what I still refer to as side one of the record! This is very catchy stuff and perhaps the least smoochy and cheesy example of late 1970's jazz-rock fusion. Oldfield was challenging himself when working on Platinum and you have to say it was worth it.<br /><br />Side 2 was a little bit baffling back then but once one got one's head round it it revealed itself to be fun and full of those characteristic Oldfield layers. It starts with Woodhenge which clearly dated back a few years before this record, it's more in the vein of Ommadawn perhaps. Things soon move on to a collection of short poppier pieces.<br /><br />If this is your first Oldfield venture I would recommend Ommadawn or the obvious Tubular Bells but don't let me put you off completely, Platinum is still an absolute classic!<br /><br />If this isn't your first visit to Platinum and you're here for the remastering; is it noticeable?

B006P0FIGU|3.0|Six feet under and rotted in the soil, Alexandre Dumas is rolling over furiously. Heck, even the makers of the much reviled THE MUSKETEER are turning over in their graves (never mind that they're probably not even dead yet). THE MUSKETEER was deplored for its shabby updating and lame use of anachronisms and its swapping of classic swordplay for a more Eastern fighting approach. This latest incarnation of Dumas' classic literature comes along and lifts that same ill-advised blueprint but adds a more pronounced Michael Bey sensibility. 2011's THE THREE MUSKETEERS is louder and bigger-budgeted and peppered with even more anachronistic touches, such as that scene in which Aramis meets D'Artagnan for the first time and he issues him a traffic citation. It's a jarring departure, if you're a stickler for faithful adaptations. Me, it depends. I enjoyed Johnny Weismuller's Tarzan films even though his interpretation of Tarzan was a far cry from E.R. Burroughs' vision. But I can't make up my mind whether to rate THE THREE MUSKETEERS 2.5 out of 5 stars, or 3.5. I had fun watching this, but there were things that seriously bugged me.<br /><br />The world ushers in the dawn of the 17th Century, a tumultuous time. After the assassination of his father, young King Louis XIII ascends the throne. But his inexperience and feckless nature allow his chief advisor, the manipulative Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), to expand his power base on the sly.<br /><br />You may spot traces of Dumas' original narrative, but it's been garishly gussied up and liberties have been taken. Young and brash D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) of Gascony rides to Paris to make his fortune, harboring dreams of becoming a Musketeer. But no sooner does he set foot in Paris than he offends in quick succession three disapproving citizens and makes an appointment with each to settle accounts by way of duel. These three, of course, are Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, the three most notorious in the ranks of the Musketeers. When the sneery Cardinal's guards interfere, D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers quickly join forces and by so doing spark lifelong friendships.<br /><br />But D'Artagnan is still far from realizing his goal. The Musketeers, under Richelieu's calculated ministrations, have fallen on hard times, are rendered obsolete, are reduced to swilling cheap wine and quarreling with the Cardinal's guards. Seeking a righteous cause around which to rally, D'Artagnan and his new friends unearth a dangerous conspiracy spearheaded by Richelieu and the treacherous Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich). This bit of plot territory is familiar enough: the Musketeers must retrieve compromising jewelry and so defend the Queen's honor and prevent a war. Only, in the book, I don't remember a storming of the Tower of London or huge, battling airships or flamethrowers. Or Milady de Winter taking such a physically active role and indulging in bullet time sequences. In that sense, the role perfectly suits Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />So, listen, if you can find it in you to put aside director Paul W.S. Anderson's bastardization of the source material... and I know that's a hard if... then you just may have fun with this latest iteration. We get a hint that this would be a departure when the film opens up with the Three Musketeers conducting a black ops in Venice. Anderson (elsewhere known as Mr. Jovovich) has a knack for staging stunning visual panoramas, even if sometimes plot and narrative are suspect. I like this version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS on several fronts. Most notably and as mentioned, the astonishing visual aesthetics. The film does justice to costumes and sets and location. It captures the grace and opulence of French architecture, never mind that the film was shot in Bavaria. Other than the distracting spoken anachronisms, it's a fun and irreverent take. The film executes a series of dynamic action sequences, with Aramis being played up as the man of the cloth who fights with ninja-like precision. Thankfully, there actually are nice bits of swordplay and enough rousing swashbuckling to recollect THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. The tone of the characters mimics the original, only extremely exaggerated. As ever, the burnt-out Athos (an excellent Matthew Macfadyen) proves to be the most complex and interesting Musketeer. Unlike other adaptations, this film does focus more on Athos and Milady de Winter's history. Milady de Winter belongs in the Femme Fatale Hall of Fame, and, as Athos learns, you roll the dice when you have truck with a temptress whose attributes include a \\"gift for corruption and a penchant for betrayal.\\" There are slow bits to this movie, and eye-rolling bits. And, more often than not, the stabs at humor miss the mark. The anachronistic elements could've been downplayed or just done away with. And I wasn't entirely sold on Jovovich as Milady or Orlando Bloom as the Duke of Buckingham. But it's worth a watch for the visual spectacle and the slick action. But you may wince when you hear a demoted-to-street patrol Aramis handing D'Artagnan a citation and accusing him: \\"Your horse took a dump on the street.\\" You can apply that as a metaphor, if you like.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary with director/producer Paul W.S. Anderson and producers Jeremy Bolt and Robert Kulzer<br />- Cast & Crew - a series of interviews and profiles on nine of the characters in the film (totaling 00:21:01 minutes)<br />- Costumes (00:05:16)<br />- Production Design (00:03:04)<br />- A New Dimension of Musketeers\\" - about the 3D rendering (00:05:18)<br />- \\"Uncovering France in Germany\\" - on shooting in Bavaria (00:02:17)<br />- \\"Fencing 101\\" - fencing boot camp (00:04:01)<br />- \\"17th Century Air Travel\\" - focus on the airship sets (00:02:23)<br />- \\"Cooper's Yard Showdown\\" - behind-the-scenes look at the skirmish between the Musketeers and the Cardinal's guards (00:02:08)<br />- \\"Milady: More Than A Lady\\" - Milla's big action sequence on the roof (00:01:19)<br />- \\"On Top of Notre Dame\\" - D'Artagnan and Rochefort's duel (00:02:15)<br />- 12 Deleted & Extended Scenes (totaling 00:14:13 minutes)ike precision.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|I did not like this album as much as I thought I would. It's not as catchy as their earlier stuff, and seems more political (although maybe their songs were always equally that way and I just didn't pick up on it). I listened to this album about three times. I think if I had to do it over again, I would buy Hypnotize but not Mesmerize.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I knew I would love the CD when I ordered it, I had all but one song memorized, but I really enjoy being able  to listen to it in the car or around the pool and not be restricted to my laptop. Great purchase, don't regret it for a second.
B000002U82|5.0|If you haven't heard this album yet you'll want to soon. This is as essential an historic record of man's musical achievements as Sgt.Peppers or Vivaldi's Four Seasons; a grand gesture indeed but fitting I think.<br /><br />It's ironic that shortly after the release of Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd embarked on an ill-fated musical project that was to utilise household items as musical instruments; little did they know that their most recent release was itslef to become a very common household item.<br /><br />Dark Side of the Moon is perhaps the pinnacle of the band's skill in arrangement; they seem to know precisely where to place each and every beat, noise, note, flurry and riff. The prism and pyrmaids of the LP's sleeve perfectly reflect this overall precise form and structure; Pink Floyd refract the ordianry dullness of the everyday and give us a rainbow of audio colour. This album flows and flows, always taking you to the next moment; there's no boredom here at all.<br /><br />If you only ever buy one pink Floyd record it would be a real shame but make sure it's this one!<br /><br />As has become my signature sign off, I'll give you another musical recommendation. If you like Pink Floyd's expansive, slightly proggy, ambitious, guitar driven sound then you should try Mohribold by Andrew Taylor (google it). I downloaded from a site called bandcamp and found that it ticked all my 1970's prog boxes whilst sounding contemporary too;)
B00005ASHM|3.0|Now before i get into the things I dislike about this album I will talk about the things I like: \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice\\" is a phenomenal opening track, and \\"God Only Knows\\" is one of the greatest songs ever written. Now along with those two, you've got the song \\"Caroline, No\\" which is a gem that is never talked about.<br /><br />Now that I have covered what I like about the album, it is time to talk about what I dislike: In my opinion this album is decent, but not \\"great\\" Rolling Stone Magazine ranked this as the SECOND greatest album of all time? I find that to be ridiculous, The Beatles albums \\"Help!\\" \\"Rubber Soul\\" \\"Revolver\\" \\"Sgt Pepper's\\" \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" \\"White Album\\" \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" alone are far superior than \\"Pet Sounds\\" not to mention many other great albums such as \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" \\"The Wild, The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle\\" and a couple Elton John albums (Goodbye Yellow Brick, Honky Chateau, Tumbleweed, and Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy.)<br /><br />I can appreciate how the album influenced music, hell, it even influenced The BEATLES! But I just don't get it... and don't even get me started on Al Jardine. I hope he gets down on his knees everyday and thanks god he was a part of The Beach Boys... those vocals of his are just foul. Brian Wilson was the genius behind the group and i have a lot of respect for him.<br /><br />I guess I just don't understand the big deal about this album...
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I did not enjoy this item as much as I thought I would. I liked their earlier stuff better. I also liked Hypnotize better, because I think Hypnotize gets to the point a little better / more directly.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love it ..holds everything I have with a little room to grow..It was everything I hoped for and a very good price..
B0087ZFH94|4.0|Is this the best way to get a taster of Mike Oldfield? Well yes it is.<br /><br />The fans will tell you that there is a lot of great stuff missing from this disc and they would be right. There's nothing here from Incantations, Platinum or QE2 for example which is a lot of people's favourite Oldfield era but nevermind! If you like what's on Two Sides and investigate further you'll get to that stuff sure enough. Oldfield's output is a bit of a mine field because over 40 years his taste has been very broad indeed. So this collection may show you what to avoid as much as what to delve deeper into. I recommend taking the plunge.<br /><br />On a slight tangent; don't let the sleeve convince you this just another Tubular Bells release! It's sleekness and chill-out vibes may also give the impression of a chill-out artist but Oldfield's music is much more than that. He's at times earthy, gutsy, dramatic and highly emotive, the sleeve fom 1985's complete Mike Oldfield painted a more appropraite picture.<br /><br />And to sign off...I've gotten into the habit of telling Oldfield fans about a young whipper-snapper by the name of Andrew Taylor who has released an album called Mohribold (google it). If you like Oldfield you'll love Mohribold! There are some Oldfield-esque moments but he's got his own style too. Maybe he's one to watch out for since Oldfield has called for an instrumetnal rock renaissence after his Olympics appearance.
B000002513|5.0|The Wild The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle is Bruce's finest work as a songwriter and as a poet. The lyrics are without a doubt, the best of his career; \\"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\\" paints the picture of living life as a teenager in the Jersey Shore. But the greatest moment of this tremendous album is the last track, \\"New York City Serenade\\" This song is Springsteen's greatest achievement. The piano intro by former E Street member David Sancious, is unbelievable; But it's not until you hear the sounds of the acoustics complimenting it perfectly that you realize that what you are listening to is golden.<br /><br />Although Max Weinberg is a better drummer, The Falsetto backing vocals of Vini \\"Mad Dog\\" Lopez that can be heard on \\"Sandy\\" and \\"Incident on 57th Street\\" is a factor that plays a huge role in the overall sound of this album.<br /><br />In conclusion, buy this album and listen to the peak of Bruce's career and you won't believe the music and lyrics that your are hearing.<br /><br />\\"Hey vibes man, hey jazz man ahh play me a serenade.\\" - NYC Serenade.
1476712042|5.0|This book peaked my interest awhile ago. The cover, title, and synopsis all appealed to me so I added Beautiful Disaster to my TBR pile. I kind of just left the book on the back burner because one tiny thing didn't appeal to me; it was showing up as a YA on Goodreads and other sites. I don't really like YA's I will occasionally read them but I normally don't go for the YA's first. The very minute I found out this wasn't a YA I snagged my copy from Netgalley and fell utterly in love with the romance Jamie McGuire created.<br /><br />Travis is the popular guy at school; all the girls love him and swarm to his every need, both in and out of the bedroom. Travis pretty much just uses woman for sex, and tosses them to the side when he is finished. That is until the day he meets Abby Abernathy. Abby is at Eastern University trying to escape her past, and her father's big name in gambling. The last thing Abby wants is to be thrown back into everything she ran away from, but that is exactly what happens the days she meets Travis Maddox. The two embark on a love hate friendship that develops into one of the most powerful and jealousy ridden relationships I have ever read about; and I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />I love when a book can bring real emotions out of me and Beautiful Disaster did just that.  I had Kleenex in one hand Kindle in the other crying, laughing, cheering every step of the way. This book is marketed as an addicting read and it most certainly is addicting. I found myself wishing the story would never end. Really it is taking everything in me not to pick Beautiful Disaster back up and hang out with Travis, Abby, America, and Shepley again.<br /><br />I think the most appealing thing about Beautiful Disaster is that the relationship between Travis and Abby isn't perfect. In fact the relationship is riddled with flaws, and secrets, and bad choices. The relationship is not the only thing that sucked me in, I also fell for the unique storyline that kept taking me by surprise and leaving me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I did receive a copy of this book from Netgalley but I will be buying a bound copy of Beautiful Disaster because I loved it so much I will reread this story again. I definitely recommend this book to readers, but it is no matter how many sites say only suitable for adult reads.aking me by surprise and leaving me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I did receive a copy of this book from Netgalley but I will be buying a bound copy of Beautiful Disaster because I loved it so much I will reread this story again.

B0081L37Z0|5.0|Ive never watched the old version of this movie or a show or whatever it was so I can't compare the two. But this movie was so funny! My husband and I loved it so we watched it about 4 times.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it.  I have read all three boys (twice).  It is an enjoyable book.  Very easy to read and entertaining. In the last book,  to me it implies<br />their might be another book to follow.  I sure hope so. This book was a pleasure to read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is by far the best book that I've ever read and the best book out of the trilogy. Although some of the scenes go too quick, it's an amazing book and I hope E. L. James decides to write another book to add to the 50 shades collection! I recommend this book, along with the other two, to almost everyone I talk to about the trilogy! Definitely is an amazing book!
B00138F3KU|5.0|This album is nothing short of a masterpiece. As a long time fan of Billy Joel I have only recently purchased this compilation and much to my surprise it became my favorite Billy Joel LP , it even included songs which I had not heard before such as \\"Your My Home Now\\" \\"I Loved These Days\\" and Everybody Loves You Now\\" as well as some of my old favorites such as \\"Miami 2017\\",\\"Summer of Highland Falls, and \\"Captain Jack\\". 4-Star rated on the Rolling Stone magazine website, I would recommend this to any serious Billy Joel fan.
630463949X|5.0|Many of us know and love Rumours, Fleetwood Mac's best selling album. The five musicians who created that masterpiece played together a long time, but eventually two members left. Then in 1997 the two returned for this concert, which was filmed in a studio. The group consists of Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks - the latter two being the ones who left and came back.<br />Most of the songs are classics, with a couple of new ones. There is no dancing -- apparently \\"The Dance\\" is just a random name. The filming and editing leaves a bit to be desired, with the worst error being the microphone that always blocks Christine McVie's face when she sings. Surely, they could have moved that camera a little to one side. But on the whole this is a wonderful recreation of highlights from Fleetwood Mac's career. I give it one of my rare Five Stars.
B004AKCME8|3.0|I would not recommend this movie for die-hard fans of Guardians of Ga'Hoole. Trust me you will be thouroughly disappointed as I was.<br />The Good Side: The movie was visually beautiful. The animation and the colours and landscape and everything. I especially like the symbolism in the movie. How around St. Aggie's was always dark and how Kludd had several dark markings on his face when he joined the Pure Ones but Soren's always remained pure white. I liked that. The score was great especially Owl City's To the Sky and they did keep up good enough with the characters.<br /><br />The Bad Side: They didn't take time to really explain the situation. Soren and Kludd were suddenly captured by the St. Aggie's Owls and the whole purpose of the Pure Ones was not properly explained as well as the flecks. They just looked like strange fragments with mystical powers. But what upset me the most was how far they went from the story line. *SPOILER ALERT* Kludd first of all WAS NOT supposed to get snatched by St. Aggies and he wasn't even Metal Beak! That was the prime of the novels! And Nyra wasn't his mate either. My family didn't read the books and they could hardly understand the movie. And I was so very very disappointed. Where was Kathryn Lasky during this production? Did she approve of this?<br /><br />In conlcusion, this movie was pretty good. Can't say I hated it. But it left me wanting so much more :(
0156034565|4.0|I loved the well-acted movie and read the book because I almost always prefer the book.  In this case Hollywood made the movie end more optimistically.<br /><br />In other ways the book read easily and engaged me in the wild, improbable romp that satirically chronicalled government, science, two professionals' marriage, military and civilian communication and the awakening of a long dormant spirit.<br /><br /> I even researched Yemen as the story made me wonder more about that country.<br /><br />For an entertaining book, it delivered .<br /><br />I still hope the \\"boy\\" in the end will get the right \\"girl\\"... In the characters'  lives that continue after I closed the book.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|when I went to this app it did not come up. but when I went to the home  I got the widget, succesfuly.
B000A1SZ2Y|3.0|I went after this based on recommendations from a few sources, all basically saying \\"sure, you can get diopter filters, but this is way better, and worth the extra cost\\".  So I had an expectation that it would be pretty decent, but I remained somewhat cynical.  It exceeds that middling expectation pretty handily, though.<br /><br />I'm still tabulating a whole slew of controlled tests to compare it with various alternatives, but my initial impression based on those is that it's surprisingly close in usability even to Nikon's 105mm Micro.  Obviously it's not as sharp generally, and definitely not in the corners, especially if you put this on a \\"wide\\"-angle lens - below about 35mm (equiv) the actual ring itself becomes visible, let alone any precursor vignetting etc.  But under telephoto that goes away, naturally.  I've tried it from 27-450 (equiv) and generally prefer it from about 80 to 300 (beyond that DOF is just too small for hand-held work, although the magnification is impressive).<br /><br />But since you're working with a very limited depth of field anyway, and I generally have my subject centred in frame, the soft edges are indistinguishable from the bokeh.  If, on the other hand, you were doing full-frame subjects, or off-centre, then you'd be seeing real big differences and this probably wouldn't be your best option.<br /><br />And chromatic aberration is high.  It's not really visible in the centre 50% or so of the frame, but beyond that it becomes increasingly obvious.  If you take neutral-coloured shots it's not too bad, but if you prefer vivid effects, it stands out like a sore thumb.  Unlike the blurriness, the chromatic aberration shows up on the bokeh just the same, so it's always visible.<br /><br />Nonetheless, in my purely subjective tests, just shooting out in the field, I've been able to capture some really nice shots, and haven't had any real problems.  It takes a little more patience than a real macro lens, because auto-focus (while mostly functional) isn't nearly as sharp or accurate (compared to the lenses without this mounted, but especially to a real macro lens).  While I generally don't rely on auto-focus for macro work, it is handy for establishing your working area, as opposed to hunting back and forth with your feet.  But then, you do have the zoom option if your lens has that, so sometimes it goes the other way.<br /><br />So it hasn't stopped me craving a really good macro lens, like the 105 (or 85, perhaps, given I do use a D3200), but when I consider it from a value-for-money perspective, this is so much better.  It is the /value/ option, though.  If money is no object, you *almost* certainly want a real macro lens...<br /><br />...only *almost* because there is one unique thing I love about this - that it clips on and off.  I can be out shooting with my telephoto zoom, capturing birds and landscapes and whatever else like normal, and then clip this on and be doing 1:1 macro in about five seconds.  It's far, far more convenient than swapping lenses, or working around the fixed focal length of most macro lenses.<br /><br />The only caveat with that is that you have to be careful to centre it over the end of the lens - the spring-loaded clips on either side are not mechanically connected nor spongy enough to self-centre, and if you don't centre it you can end up with a little bit of distortion, or even part of the ring visible in your shot.<br /><br />One other annoyance is that it's a two-piece set.  The smaller piece, containing the actual lens elements, is threaded for a 49mm lens.  The second piece that it threads into, and provides the spring-loaded clips, will adapt to much larger lenses, but with the two pieces so connected, the rear lens cap doesn't fit on it.  So if, like me, you're only ever going to be used in that manner, it's annoying to have to unscrew the two pieces in order to put it back in my camera bag.<br /><br />Update several months on:  despite my initial favour of this,I've found in practice I haven't really used it much.  I almost always reach for my extension tubes instead.  It's definitely a better option than traditional screw-on diopter filters, which I've basically never used since buying and first playing with, but when you consider that you can get a set of autofocusing extension tubes for around the same price, it seems I'm voting for the latter.  It's still a bargain compared to a dedicated macro lens, and the conveniences I mentioned still stand.  I guess I've just discovered that I don't switch in and out of \\"macro\\" mode as rapidly or frequently as I used to.  Given that, and that extension tubes (on a quality lens) do give better results, I'd recommend those instead by default.I've found in practice I haven't really used it much.

B00003CWTI|4.0|Director/writer/producer Paul Thomas Anderson delivered this Christmas present to critics and filmgoers in 1999 with his follow-up to the successful \\"Boogie Nights.\\"  Many of the same cast members reappear here, in what could be described as a messy stew of mostly unlikable characters.  Anderson's sense of filmmaking tends to mimic some of Robert Altman's best films (\\"Short Cuts\\", \\"Nashville\\" come to mind) in which an ensemble cast with little connection cross paths in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Anderson sets the stage at the beginning showing what appear to be newsreel clips of unusual and coincidental events from the 1940's.  In one of the film's story lines, an old man (Jason Robards) lies dying in his home, full of cancer.  His much younger wife (Julianne Moore) who had married him for his money is now prescription drug dependent and remorseful as he nears death.  The man's estranged son (Tom Cruise in an Oscar nominated performance) is a televangelist-like motivational speaker whose pitch is to convince men they can sexually exploit women.  Another pairing is Claudia (Melora Walters) as a cocaine addict who gets a visit from a cop (John C. Reilly) who lacks self-confidence in his personal and professional life.  Phillip Baker Hall is an aging game show host who just learned he is also dying of cancer.  He's also the father of Claudia.  One of the game show contestants is boy of about 12 (Jeremy Blackman), brilliant and controlled by an overbearing father.  A previous contestant who became famous (William H. Macy) is now nearly broke and contemplates robbing his former employer.<br /><br />The film is full of stellar performances throughout.  Watch Cruise as Frank Mackey when his cocky banter with a female journalist devolves into total silence as she probes his early life.  Check out Robards as the dying TV executive when he confesses to his caretaker (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) his many regrets regarding his family.  The always remarkable Moore stews in a scene where the pharmacists question her need for the strong narcotics she is getting at a drug store.  The film is certainly not without controversy and humor as many of the events seem so random and unlikely, but go back to the opening.<br /><br />Then there is the final act and the now iconic \\"rain of frogs.\\"  What does it mean?  Well, I'm not sure.  There is the biblical passage out of Exodus where God speaks of this event if the \\"slaves\\" are not allowed to leave with Moses.  Are the \\"slaves\\" the children being exploited in the film?  Perhaps the best answer is the closing seen where young Stanley (Blackman) sits in a library during the frog falling and says \\"This happens.  This is something that happens.\\"  Probably just as much as the cast singing over Aimee Mann's \\"Save Me\\" in individual scenes.  Anything might happen on Magnolia Street.where the pharmacists question her need for the strong narcotics she is getting at a drug store.

0671042858|5.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon<br />By Stephen King<br /><br />Nine year old Trisha McFarland is hiking along listening to her mother and older brother bicker incessantly she begs for them to stop so she can use the restroom but they are so engrossed with their conversation they don't even notice. Trisha decides to stop anyways thinking she will do her business and she will be able to catch up with them in no time and maybe, just maybe, they will notice her missing and it will give them something else to talk about. But Trisha can't seem to find where they have gone off to; she can't even find the trail she was on. Now Trisha is lost in the woods with only her Walkman to give her comfort as she tunes into baseball games and fantasizes that Tom Gordon is there with her protecting her. Soon, something begins to follow her, something sinister, will Trisha be able to find her way to safety or will whatever has taken notice of her end her misery once and for all?<br /><br />With this novel it is hard to decipher what is illusion and what is truth as Trisha's imagination starts to play tricks on her but so does something else, at times it gets confusing and most of the time I kept thinking \\"well that must be fake too\\" when it was actually something that was supposed to be physically happening. I think this is why the book was so interesting though that you couldn't tell. I haven't read much of Stephen King's work, but this was spooky, not in the bump in the night sort of way, but putting aside that Trisha is nine how would anyone react to being lost for days in the woods. All in all it was an interesting story and a good read, Stephen King is a great writer and he was able to bring to life the deeper recesses of the human mind along with the supernatural.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I have nothing against the genre of erotic literature.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an amazing addition to the YA genre, and an all-around good read.  Collins writes a character wise beyond her years, expanding her range well beyond the youth of its intended genre, yet inundated with the social limitations of being a teenager.<br /><br />This story does a good job of bringing adult themes into a YA storyline without them being overwrought, without generating a narrator whose emotional capacity is above the \\"standard\\" of believable teen, or without being graphic despite being explicitly vivid.<br /><br />There were a few places where I wasn't sure why the author handled components of the story the way she did, mechanically, but really no show-stoppers at all. I, personally, get bored with a narrator who second-guesses herself constantly, particularly with matters of romance. I could dismiss it in this story because the author creates a character in a world so different from my own that I have to suspend regular emotional reactions to life, to extreme events, yet... I confess, I got tired of the waffling.<br /><br />I like the overall writing style, though. I love reading things where every line moves the story forward. Collins does a good job of that, yet not spelling out where the story is moving.

B006DZYM0A|3.0|There is no one named Margaret in the movie. It comes from a poem that is read. But that's okay I grew up watching Captain Kangaroo who is nether a captain nor a kangaroo. In fact there may have been a lot of stuff I didn't grasp in this film, but here goes.<br /><br />The film opens in slow motion to illustrate how life moves slowly along until one moment suddenly changes and defines it. Lisa (Anna Paquin) distracts a bus driver who runs a red light and kills a women. She wants to do the right thing, but what is it? The grief and moral dilemma disrupts her life and her relationships.<br /><br />The film is well made. The acting was excellent as was the writing...I think. I just didn't enjoy the film, but I didn't dislike it either. The main problem I have with the overall theme is that Lisa wants justice for the dead woman. She has grief which we see, but we don't see her publicly confess her role in the death. She doesn't seem to have any guilt...or perhaps that is the point of the film is that we quickly forgive our own guilt...except we don't. I kept waiting for Lisa to take blame for what had happened.<br /><br />This is a film about grief, but it is not really sad. Matt Damon plays a geometry teacher who is a love interest of Lisa. Matthew Broderick plays a literature teacher whose classes provide the film with multiple confusing deeper themes for you to pick from in case you don't like the aspect of simply dealing with grief. After watching the film, I felt like I needed a hug.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, nudity (J. Smith-Cameron, Ann Paquin silhouette)
0345803493|1.0|I read the first book in the series and I got really excited. With the contract he made her sign and the play room with all of the toys you're kind of led to believe that this is going to be all dark and hardcore. So you're willing to over look some of the writing flaws and little annoying things. You might even think the style is kind of cute. That's how I felt.<br /><br />So I started reading the second book, really excited to see where the relationship would go and read about some more interesting bdsm dynamics and kinky sex. I feel robbed. Why? Because I really wasn't expecting that much. All I wanted was some kinky dark romance, some character development, maybe something that goes into relationship dynamics, a plot that doesn't go all the frig over the place. I didn't need a really complex plot just something consistent.<br /><br />If you're expecting something dark and kinky prepare to be disappointed. I think Christian and Anna are basically fighting to see who has the bigger pair of ovaries in this book. At the end of the last book Anna left and as soon as you start this one she's goes right back to him, only now she's the love of his life and he's a changed man. No more kinkyness, it's all love making and lets get married and I'm going to buy this house for us and we'll have kids and \\"please don't leave me I need you Anna!\\" the plot really goes everywhere but never into much depth. One second they're at a party then she's talking to mrs. Robinson, then he's a sadist , but guess what he's actually not, then her boss is trying to attack her, then Christians ex sub is crazy and in her apartment, but we never really find out exactly why, then they're buying a house and the hillicopter goes missing......I'm like are you serious!?!<br /><br />I mean I guess there's more plot than the first book but it's so crazy and all over the place that it makes they writing that much more annoying. It's no longer cute. Reading every character in the book say laters baby or some variation of it made me want dig my eyes out with my fingers. What's worse is everybody in my life seems to think its cute to say it in real life and it's not it sounds stupid and creepy. And if I have to read about some inner goddess doing another arabesque or hear everyone idolize such a self deprecating character and read about how for some reason every guy in this book wants her even though she has no self esteem and is as annoying and immature as hell, I'm simply going to combust and not in a sexy way.

145162607X|5.0|Philippa Gregory has long been associated with the highest quality in historical fiction. After reinventing the genre with her highly popular The Other Boleyn Girl, Gregory has consistently turned out quality period novels, taking on Henry VIII's other and somewhat lesser known wives, Queen Elizabeth I and the many ladies of the War of the Roses. In her latest entry into her Cousins' War series, Gregory tells the story of Anne Neville, the daughter of the famous kingmaker, Richard Neville, who put Edward of York on the throne.<br /><br />It may seem simple on the surface, but there is much more to Anne's story. After Edward's highly unpopular marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the subject of The White Queen, Anne's father felt betrayed and in order to secure his own connections to the throne, he marries Anne's older sister Isabel to Edward' brother George. When a series of failed revolts forces the Nevilles out of England, Anne is married to the exiled Edward of Lancaster in one last desperate attempt to put a Neville on the throne. But when the last Lancaster push for the throne fails, Anne is left adrift with an uncertain future.<br /><br />Dare I say that Kingmaker's Daughter is one of the best books in the Cousins' War so far? While I enjoyed the others, especially The White Queen, Kingmaker's Daughter followed an incredibly fascinating young woman and her struggle as a political pawn during one of the most turbulent periods in British history. Through Anne starts off as a somewhat meek and weak young woman, she draws strength from her life experiences and grows into a stronger, more intelligent and motivated woman. On virtually every page, I fell more in love with Anne, cheering for her and wanting her to succeed and find happiness in a world that views her as little more than an annoying pawn.<br /><br />Kingmaker's Daughter is considered Gregory's first \\"sister\\" story since Other Boleyn girl. Though the entire novel takes place through the eyes of Anne, there is ample time given to the complex relationship that Anne and her sister Isabel share (and, admittedly, I enjoyed Isabel more than Anne at first). Through all of the drama, the political ambition that seems to have rubbed off on the girls from their father, the greed and their relationship with their mother, Isabel and Anne are still sisters caught up in war and politics in a world where women do not have the power that men do.<br /><br />I was honestly a tad bit disappointed with how Gregory handled the \\"sisters\\" aspect of the novel. Though Isabel and Anne's rivals and dramas were given some page time, the majority of the novel focused on the many other issues of the war and the sisters' relationship, I felt, wasn't given as much time as I would have liked. Also, for a while it seemed liked the working title for this book was \\"The Kingmaker's Daughters,\\" which implied that it was about Anne AND Isabel. Though Anne's story may be more interesting, I would have liked to have seem some narration by Isabel to help the reader get a peek into her life and get her side of the story.<br /><br />Aside from the that, the only other small thing that bothered me was the repetition. Since Gregory has already written three novels about this period, it can be a little difficult to discuss fully new events in each book. Though Kingmaker focused on different characters and angles, it still covered the same period and the same conflicts, so at times I felt like I was reading too much of the same things that happened in the previous books.<br /><br />Yet, despite these few stumbling blocks, Gregory still delivers an incredibly exquisite, well-constructed world of high historical detail and compelling characters. Kingmaker's Daughter is one of the standout novels of the Cousins' War, with a lot of action, politics and great character conflict that's exactly what Gregory fans have come to crave.

B000JQU4TW|4.0|A classic is a book that everyone knows, and people have seldom read. I am glad that I gave myself the chance to know Wilde from the source. The wit and humor of Lord Henry's aphorisms definitely make this a quotable, laugh aloud read. Many of the dry, cynical observations, remain quite fresh even a 100 years later.

0307959856|3.0|Finally finished \\"Death Comes to Pemberley,\\" P.D. James' murder-mystery sequel to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  I don't know what the Jane Austen fans and scholars thought, but I wonder if it would have received much interest had it not been written by the famous P.D. James.  Still, it was fun to be back in that era of manners and hand-written correspondence, and the summary of the original novel as told in the prologue is lovely.  Not sure whether there will be a movie version, but if so I suppose they'll have to give Elizabeth a more prominent role, since she is largely relegated to the opening chapters and the epilogue.  Nice quote at the end, spoken by Elizabeth to Darcy: \\"Let us look on the past only as it gives us pleasure, and to the future with confidence and hope\\".

B004RKXN44|5.0|He wants her. There's no use lying to himself about that. Hawke aches to possess her with a single-minded intensity that has his wolf starving for the most intimate of skin privileges. But he's not going to take her. He's a mature wolf changling, alpha of SnowDancer, and significantly older than she is. But damn, he wants her.<br /><br />PsyNet defector and cardinal X-Psy Sienna Lauren is an adult in the pack, and given her past, she's older than her years. She is the ultimate weapon, one that requires unimaginable discipline, and it makes her crazy that the one man she wants, Hawke, refuses to see her as anything but the child she was never allowed to be.<br /><br />As attacks by an aggressive faction of Psy known as Pure Psy are leveled against SnowDancer and the winds of a burgeoning war start to blow in their direction, Hawke's focus is torn between his pack and his desire for the one woman he refuses to take. His resolve is legendary, but even he has to see that a woman who can fight for her pack, risk her life for them, is old enough to decide who she lets into her bed.<br /><br />She has to do something to show the stubborn wolf she is more than the child he sees. Even if it endangers the woman she's become.<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times I've highly anticipated a book in series only to have that book disappoint in some way or another. You'd think I'd know better than to ever let myself feel that anticipation, but it's a lesson I seem to need to keep learning. Or maybe it's books like this, those rare awesome books that are highly anticipated...and manage to deliver for me on every front...that keep anticipation burning.<br /><br />Don't know. Don't care, either, at the moment. I'm too busy being thrilled with this book.<br /><br />Obviously, as I'm still reading this series at the tenth book, both the series and the author are favorites of mine. Some of the books in this series have been more beloved than others, and I do slightly prefer Singh's Guild Hunter series to the Psy/Changling series, but both are two of my favorite ongoing series and I highly recommend both for fans of well-written and imaginative paranormal romance/urban fantasy romance.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book. The complexity of the plot and the myriad of plot threads that Singh wove together throughout the story were impressive. There's so much that goes on, and so many characters involved in so much of it, with a rock-solid foundation built by every one of the preceding books, that I would definitely not recommend a reader new to the series start here.<br /><br />It could be done, Singh has a gift for condensing necessary exposition and fitting it in well with current developments, but so much of the emotional impact would be lost that it just shouldn't be.<br /><br />I adored the relationship arc and character developments for Hawke and Sienna in this book. It wasn't what I would call a traditional romance, really, and that's what I love about Singh. She has such a gift for creating stories that fit perfectly with the characters featured in it. Hawke and Sienna have known each other for a while, have battled and locked horns, have struggled against their attraction for years, so the relationship between them is in a completely different place and needed completely different things than, say, Judd and Brenna did in their book.<br /><br />The pack, the past, who they are, what they're responsible for, what they can do, the issues each have with how they feel, the threat of the Psy, all of that plays a significant role in each character's definition and development, not to mention on their romance. It was frustrating at times (very frustrating at times). It was enlightening at others. There were moments that made me mad and moments that made me laugh. Sometimes it just flat-out broke my heart. For me, though, all the sublimely well-crafted pieces that factored into their personalities and into every moment oftheir relationship arc worked...perfectly. I loved every second of it.<br /><br />I was also very much in love with the secondary romance between pack healer Lara and Walker, Sienna's uncle. Where the relationship between Hawke and Sienna was rocky, fiery, raging with emotion, and practically shouting its passion and angst, hurt and strength, stubbornness and pride, Lara and Walker's relationship balanced that with its quiet implacability, its soft moments and tender touches. The frustrations were more internal, the feelings more subdued. That relationship created such a wonderful counterpoint to Hawke and Sienna's point that I can't imagine what the book would have been like without it.<br /><br />By no means is this book, or any of the books in this series, focused solely on the romance, though. This one definitely provided some forward progression on the Pure Psy threat and the continuing degeneration of the Council and the PsyNet. There are so many, many balls up in the air in this series that a single book can't really touch on every plot point without being six hundred pages long, but there were certainly a lot covered here. Singh manages to keep me guessing on some things, keep me horrified about others, and still manages to introduce new story elements all the time.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how she does it. I don't know how this series, even at the tenth book, feels just as fresh, just as original, just as intriguing and compelling and a thousand times as complex as it did in the beginning. I open a Psy/Changling book and feel like I'm visiting old, beloved friends who I care about very much...even if I wouldn't want to catch a meal with them. In particular, I want to thank Singh for the gift of seeing Lucas and Sasha's newest development meet the world.<br /><br />I'm so incredibly invested in this series. To me that's the mark of a series that is a step above, one that has just that little extra that makes it stand out among a huge crowd. This, its tenth installment, is perhaps the best of them for me.

B007P06DJK|3.0|This recording was one of the most important musical experiences at the time of its release. I also really love the new documentary following the making of the record but I feel as if I have been merchandised. I wanted the DVD of the movie and found that the only way to get a DVD separately was to buy the Blu-ray version. Luckily  I have a blu-ray player but I couldn't get the DVD as presents for most of my friends. I then bought this CD/DVD package assuming that the music was the recording of the anniversary tour NOT a remix of the original recording.  I feel as if the integrity of the producers or marketers fell short of my expectations... Too bad

B000FCKC4C|5.0|You who wander in the Wasteland of this present time! Do your weary soul a favour and give this work a chance, by putting aside (post/)modern prejudices about what a 'novel' should be. This is a timeless spiritual parable, no, a nested series of parables, and as such is a fabulous gem that sparkles in a different way every time you pick it up with an open heart and mind.<br /><br />I write this in homage to a great and true parable-weaver, who is subtle enough to be simple, cares enough to be direct, and knows enough to be, at many points throughout the book, simply divine, transcendent, eclipsing any deficiencies (including male chauvinism) so many of the reviewers make so much of here. They strain at cultural gnats while swallowing the camel of spiritual cynicism.<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" inspired me to write in the same genre a book which I venture (in fear and trembling at my own audacity) to offer to anyone who reads Paulo's masterpiece and yearns to read other attempts at capturing some of the perennial wisdom hidden just beneath the surface, or in plain sight, within this world.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Consider this review a gift to you of the hours you would've spent not only reading this book, but wondering where the Editor was throughout the publication process.  It is poorly written, repetitious and a poor execution of what could've been a really interesting realisation of the concept.  Read it if you want to stay 'current', but beware - if you didn't already know, it's essentially one story cut across three books.  It's not a trilogy by any means.  With so many amazing, beautiful and inspiring books out there - save your precious time and read them.

Rarely does such an album ever get recognized on a broad scale, but I new I had to get it before it went off my radar, and am I glad I did. Steven Wilson helped in the production of Damnation, one of my most favorite Opeth albums (can you really have a favorite?) Anyways, the two work together masterfully to weave a somber and very mood oriented abysmal and melancholy web of melodies that are equally as haunting as they are simple, as heavy as they are elusive. Behold the mystery, the magic, the mayhem of two brilliant musical minds congealed into one.

There are many books throughout history that are hotter, and dirtier. ('The Story of O' and 'Tropic of Capricorn' being two) It's been labeled 'mommy porn'. But, in most modern women's defense- let me say that; the Mom has to be in charge of EVERYTHING. So, let us have our silly fantasies that we could let someone else be in charge of something! Book #1 is the best, but I read #2 & #3 just to see what happened to the characters.

B00005JKQZ|2.0|A Beautiful Mind tells the story of socially awkward yet fantastically intelligent maths professor John Nash, who came up with (we are told) revolutionary new ways of analysing game theory -- whatever that is. And here is where this movie runs into its first real problem, one it never overcomes. If you're going to describe the life of a genius, you have to show us why he's a genius. The movie instead spends literally 30 seconds on what game theory is and then rushes back to scenes of him writing mathematical squiggles on windows and chalk boards. I'm sorry, this is not good enough. The director is so keen to show us a highly fictionalised and lurid account of Nash's descent into schizophrenia that the main reason we care about the guy (he's a mathematical genius, after all) ends up totally forgotten. I wish I'd read the book on which this is based before I saw the film, since many of the imagined scenes are quite ludicrous. Although I concede it's not easy to show what schizophrenia is like, there must have been better ways of describing it that this. We are treated to endless bizarre dreamlike scenes involving Russian nuclear bombs and Nash's imaginary mysterious spy boss who asks him to carry out ever more maniacal tasks. This all makes for very uncomfortable viewing and worse, it doesn't teach us anything. Nor do we learn why Nash suddenly returned to a state bordering on normality and how he came to be awarded the Nobel Prize. The film omits to mention he fathered a child before he met his wife and doesn't tell us she left him for several years. This is a mess of a film and much less interesting than it could have been.

0446573019|1.0|What can I say? It's no Twilight, not even close. David Baldacci tries desperately to climb to the sophisticated level of Stephenie Meyer's masterpiece Twilight Saga, yet completely fails to include any mention of vampires or any mythical creatures for that matter at all!? It's an embarrassment that Baldacci will live with for years to come, a fate not half as terrible as was inflicted on any poor soul that happened to read this book.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I saw this film to complete the Nolan trilogy.Nolan has realized a large vision with solid,definable characters,who anchor the wild and less plausible aspects of a comic book transferred to screen. So you look for Gary Oldman's Police Commisioner,Jim Gordan,you look for Michael Caine's Alfred,you look for Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox,you especially look for Christian Bale's definitive Batman.His dark growl is less pronounced and it was a pleasure to hear him speak,better,more vulnerable.Bale is the only actor who has come to own the role.<br /><br />These films(and Inception) court a mass audience,but unlike other blockbuster franchises,he treats his audience with a measure of respect for their intelligence.His Batman attempts to connect with the zeitgeist,here it's the Occupy movement and the resentment against the bankers and the rich.He also picks up plot strands from the earlier films,Batman Begins,The Dark Knight.Christian Bale's limping Bruce Wayne,is scarred from the effort and has drawn down the guilt of Harvey Dent's death.<br /><br />Nolan wiped away the kitsch debacles of Joel Schumacher's Batman films by turning to the character's origins as created in Frank Miller's graphic Batman:Year One & The Dark Knight Returns. The nourish elements mean women are treated as archetypes,the femme fatale,the victim or ingénue, often in parts that are underwritten and don't allow development, to be distrusted,longed for or mourned.Hathaway provides the spark of fun and sexuality,the catburglar coopted by Wayne in the battle for Gotham's soul.Cotillard is a mystery philanthropist with a twist.<br /><br />In this film we get a recycling of the Liam Neeson Ra's al Ghu'sl League of Shadows.Tom Hardy's Bane is little more than an anarchist in a sheepskin jacket,inflated to physically menacing,broody and mean proportions,revenge offspring for the death of the villain in Begins.He offers liberation to the people but as in the French Revolution there is the aftermath:terror.His mask occludes his face, Lecter-like,but what he says can be heard.The fight with Batman provides one of the film's centre- pieces,putting Wayne in a hole from which he has to rise out of to rebuild his heroic identity.Bruce's other fight is with his inner demons.<br /><br />There's no central character of the order of Ledger's Joker.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Officer Blakeis the honest cop who you look for,a guide in the chaotic frenzy that breaks out.There are chases with new Bat vehicles(a flier and an attack bike),street battles between armies of cops and mercenaries.The soundtrack pounding score by Hans Zimmer soars,but at times occludes some of the dialogue.Nolan seems like Shakespeare and Dickens(Two Cities) to have a fear of large mobs.Again he's largely free of CGI,preferring pure film stock and action freshness.This is a worthy end to a fantastic trilogy,with an opening for another director.Nolan the guru of escapism.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|What if there were a movie that tackled such difficult issues as facing your past, gender norms, feminism, gay acceptance, growing old, single parenthood, economic hardship and lost love?<br /><br />You wouldn't want to see it, framed that way, and neither would I -- which is reason number 100-or-so that I love this movie: It's so much fun you don't realize that yes, it DOES have a plot, and the issues are pretty dang serious.<br /><br />Framed around the songs of ABBA, that's quite a challenge. ABBA, like most pop groups, wrote the same love song over and over, and here they are trying to use that one song to tell the stories of 1. A young woman searching for her biological father because she hopes this will make her whole 2. The mother facing the here-and-now of her past free spirit 3.Three men facing whether they are (or ever should be) fathers and whether they'll ever be in love again (and with whom)4.A young man deciding whether to give in to a poofy over the top wedding ceremony against his better judgement because it will make the woman he loves happy.<br /><br />In the \\"classic\\" movie musicals, the sets looked like sets--you can see the backdrops pretty well in Oklahoma! and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers--so if the last time you saw a musical it was from the 40s, the real life location here may be jarring. You'll get used to it. I also was suprised--and am pretty much jumping for joy--that the extras they chose are not Hollywood models but people with average faces and figures who know how to dance. (The nice exception is the beach dancing led by Christine Baranski, and let me tell you, it so works.)<br /><br />And speaking of not overdone, LOVED the singing. Pierce Brosnan is wonderful, \\"courageous\\" someone put it. He's not portraying a musician. He's portraying a man so overcome with emotion he bursts into song. Meryl Streep, whose voice is wonderful, IS portraying a singer. It so works. Their duets are touching. All the voices are just right for the parts they play.<br /><br />And if it wraps up a little too cleanly for real life, do I mind? Nope, I wish it were this way.  They all live happily ever after. And that's fine with me.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|When I first picked this book up at the book store, I was only going on the fact that it was a popular show and everyone liked it. So I started reading it...<br /><br />It opens up with a flashback on the day Alison DiLaurentis goes missing.<br /><br />The beginning of the story goes along with the four main girls of the series (and Ali's best friends). Aria is moving back from living in Iceland for a few years. Emily is welcoming the new girl to the neighborhood and is maybe getting a little friendly with HER. Spencer is trying to out do her sister, a lifelong goal; plus getting comfy with her sister's new bf. And Hanna is trying to keep out of trouble when shoplifting from a jewelry store.<br /><br />Back when Ali was alive, she kept secrets from each and every one of them, and used them as blackmail. And now A is using them against the girls in her game. Using them for her own good.<br /><br />The mysterious A starts sending the four girls notes, texts, and emails, threatening to use their dirty little secrets against them. The girls (after breaking up from their friendship so long ago) reunite to try and figure out who A is while keeping their secrets quiet.<br /><br />Around the end of the book, Ali's body is finally found in her back yard barried in a hole. While at her funeral, the girls get a mysterious text saying \\"I'm still here b*tches, and I know everything.\\"<br /><br />I will be honest, this book is very innapropriate for children under 14, will all the language, sex talk, and themes. But I still think this was an amazing book and suggest it to anyone.<br /><br />*PS this is not anything like the show
B005VPRET4|5.0|I love that Lego has finally created a set that girls are excited about.  I picked up this set for $10, which really made me happy.  But seeing my 5 year old reading the directions and figuring out how the pieces went based on the pictures is what made it all worthwhile.  The figures and food fit in with girl play styles.  Highly recommend.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|What can you say about Jaws. I was 14 when this movie premiered and there's is no movie made that puts it in its place. I couldn't sleep that night because it was so impactful. After all these years and at least 20 viewings of this movie since the premier its still a blast to watch.

B004J18DBY|5.0|Because I was raised in Canada, however during a slightly later era than within this story, I found so much that I could relate to as I read. Anyone who grew up in Canada between the 1940s to the 1970s will find many incidents, thoughts, emotions, and words that they will recognize in this book. I especially understood the difficulty described relating to girls my own age when I was in elementary school and all that ridiculous, silly, and mean attitude females display towards each other when they are supposed to be friends. As  the main character, Elaine Risely matures, the same understanding emerges as she describes the way some women act around men in order to get attention, even more ridiculous. Embarrassing if you happen to be unlucky enough to be present during their antics. I can remember secretly rolling my eyes when these young women went into overdrive with a caricature of femininity and pretending they were so helpless but what was even more surprising is how the guys fell for this tripe. But, hey, maybe the guys just wanted to fall for that stuff because it probably got them what they wanted anyway. I shouldn't be so quick to judge a style I could never imagine adopting.<br /><br />I enjoy well-written, emotionally evocative stories that stay with me and make me want to read more works by the author. If I ever decide to write a novel, I want to have a similar style to Margaret Atwood's wonderful ways of making words appear as pictures in the mind - word pictures. She knows how to keep a reader anticipating that moment when you can finally get back to the book and shut-out everything around you and revel in the lives of each character.  I highly recommend this book to anyone even if you did not grow up in Canada.

B006IMY5ZU|4.0|Professional sports in America (and more recently elsewhere as well) has always been about making money, making money for the owners, making money for the players, and making money for the inevitable ten-percenters that come around whenever the smell of money  is in the air. Professional big time sports, moreover is about big money, real big money as this slice of sports management film, Moneyball, amply demonstrates. But it is also, at some level, depending on the sport, the team, and the guys who put together such teams about winning, winning the brass ring. And that is what makes this film that I would probably pass over on other grounds so intriguing<br /><br />Frankly it has been a while since I have even summoned the courage to watch sports on television much less attend some event in person. And that takes some doing in a city like Boston which over the past decade or so has won championships in all of the four major sports in America (baseball, football, basketball, hockey for the very clueless). And the main reason for that stance is the point I made above about the money pit. But it also about the obscene price of the winning that has distorted the legitimate role of sports in society way out of kilter. Winning and winning merely by overwhelming out-spending the other guys seems to have diminished my capacity to watch  guys who are mostly going through the motions.<br /><br />But Moneyball, and the story behind it presents another story, a story that I could actually relate to. What if you just, strapped for cash and in a minor franchise market, used every available method, including technology to build a team not of hot shots (although they are nice to see) but of guys who could stand to be together in the same room for more than fifteen minutes. That seemed like a premise worth trying.<br /><br />And that premise gets a tryout here as Billy Beane (played by Robert Redford, oops, Brad Pitts), as the general manager of the Oakland As (a team that back in the glory days, back in the Reggie, Catfish, Sal, Blue Moon, et. al days,  back in the early 1970s when I lived there, I followed like crazy), a wonk from Yale and a recalcitrant manger (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) work their magic, and work it almost to that final game of the year. The one that in the end is the only one that counts. But, except maybe in horseshoes, almost doesn't count doesn't mean a thing so it in the end is back to the drawing board to work out the missing links. Nice try though, nice premise, and nice sports film even for non-sports nuts.
0345803485|1.0|I might be swimming against the current here, especially since the Fifty Shades Trilogy is in the top sellers lists in various countries. However, I believe that the fact that the story has already been published online, under the pseudonym Snowqueen's Icedragon, and it went unnoticed (at least no one made a fuss about it - as we are seeing with the books now), and that it was published by an Australian publisher in 2011 and did not make the top lists, should tell you something about publishers and the value of a marketing campaign.<br /><br />The female protagonist is a young woman of 21 - Anastacia Steele - whom thinks of herself ugly, but must be really good looking since most of the male characters in the book try to make a pass at her.<br /><br />The story starts when her friend, the college newspaper writer, asks Anastacia to take her place in an interview with the super-rich-drop-dead-gorgeous-CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc., Mr. Christian Grey.<br /><br />Of course Mr. Grey tries to show himself as a heartless executive, but in the interview he let it slip that he is really a man concerned with the common good and the future of the planet.<br /><br />\\" 'That sounds like your heart talking rather than logic and facts.'<br /><br />His mouth quirks up, and he stares appraisingly at me.<br /><br />`Possibly. Though there are people who'd say I don't have a heart.'\\"<br /><br />So, the book goes on and on to show how Christian Grey is a terrible guy, but deep inside, just a soft heart with a troubled soul.<br /><br />All the hype about the book, I believe, is due to the fact that it can be categorized as erotic literature. However, after few passages, it gets really boring and more of the same to read over and over again how Miss Anastacia and Mr. Grey in the end, always come.<br /><br />I am sure you've heard that the book is about Sub Dom, which I believe is a light version of S&M, so, I won't be spoiling your reading if I tell you about that:<br /><br />\\" `You're a sadist'?<br /><br />`I'm a Dominant.' His eyes are a scorching gray, intense.<br /><br />`What does that mean?' I whisper.<br /><br />`It means that I want you to willing surrender yourself to me, in all things.'<br /><br />( bla, bla, bla)<br /><br />`I have rules, and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don't, I shall punish you, and you will learn,' he whispers.<br /><br />(bla, bla, bla)<br /><br />`Okay, and what do I get out of this?'<br /><br />He shrugs and looks almost apologetic.<br /><br />`Me'. He says simply.\\"<br /><br />I am not a feminist, and I do not want to burn bras or raise any flags here, but exactly WHY women are actually spending money to buy this book? Of course Grey is handsome and rich, but Ana Steele seems to have a brain and the looks, so something wrong with this picture.<br /><br />The author tries to create a plot with a bit of a trill, some reality TV show psychology and of course, romance! She also uses prose, and email exchanges (after Grey gives a BlackBerry, an IPad and a MacBook to Miss Anastacia, probably the only college girl in 2012 that doesn't own a computer) to convey the story.<br /><br />So, if don't like a man telling you what to do and value your time, you may find better things to read that Fifty Shades of Grey.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great version and totally playable. at any time. I would recommend this game to any solitaire player to enjoy often.
0810989956|5.0|This book is great for fans of the series. The best  part of this book is the DO IT YOUR SELF, it give the reader the chance to write his or her ideas in it. So your some what of an author of this book, which is great!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I do not give fives, as I believe every writer has room for improvement. However, I am breaking that tradition with Raven's shadow, (Blood Song Series, Book #1). Anthony Ryan has created a strong first book in his series. The subsequent books should shine with this first book as an indicator and compass.<br />The prologue sucked me into the story and grabbed my interest.  I just had to read more.  This book has all the fundamental aspects of humanity; hate, revenge, jealousy, fear, abandonment all steeped in the art of war, but also tempered with love, loyalty, friendship, and dedication. The love interest is written and handled, just right; not overbearing and sloppy, as so many are.  The author seemed to always know where to draw the line and keep to the story.  His character development takes on a quality all of its own. Ryan kept his priorities in line and has created a well rounded story.<br />This is an exceptionally executed book.  Take the opportunity to read it and you also will be drawn into the Raven's shadow. If you have any doubts, read the sample, and then order it immediately so you can read more, as I did.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|If you want to progress you can set it harder. If you want an easy win you can get it. I do wish you could change the board and the kindle orientation. Also,  when you back up to review the computer's move, sometimes it won't make the same move again.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't know who I detested more! Jim for pushing his \\"thing\\" or her for putting up for it?<br /><br />All I found was a whole lot of kink looking for a storyline........
B008N1LL42|5.0|This movie was excellent with an intelligent, strong, upbeat storyline!!!! The actors and actresses did a very professional job, bringing believability to a science fiction theme. The critics didn't like it because it wasn't wreathing with banality and gross violence like Prometheus. They liked Prometheus can I say more, lol, they raved about that movie. Talk about stupidity.<br />The reason Battleship was not a success is the terrible trailers. Next time anyone is putting out a quality movie, let some of the story out. The trailers portrayed the women as wimps when they were powerful additions to the story. Let it out that a beautiful woman has a mind. The critics say it had predictable lines, they were soo wrong, but again they liked the stupid utterly no redeeming attributes of Prometheus. Can you tell I felt like I lost my money on Prometheus? I can't say enough about how bad that movie was.<br />I'm really sorry that a movie as GREAT AS BATTLESHIP was smeared. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD.<br />I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE COMPLETELY, AN EXCELLENT ENTERPRIZE BY ALL, FROM ACTORS TO SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I love this piece. I own an infinity g35x with iPod integration. The cable that came with the car works fine, but it does not power my iPod. Even on a full charge the iPod would be dead or at least close to dead by the time I would reach my destination. I've done a ton of research online and with car audio techs, and no one had a solution to power my iPod through the stock iPod cable. Now with this unit, my iPod is ALWAYS charged and full when I need it. I'm huge on sound quality so I'm happy to report that this device does not negatively affect the sound. All in all I would recommend this to anyone that wants a sturdy, non sound degrading Dock connector that will power your iPod even with older connectors.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I can understand why it catures the imagination of most women but the storyline is weak and repetitive,although it keeps you reading to see what the next adventure in bed is going to be.
0374203032|4.0|As author Michael J. Sandel gives example after example of market value versus moral value, I found myself seeing both sides of his arguments. This dichotomy is maddening, but it is also why I love this book.<br /><br />I believe the whole point of What Money Can't Buy is framed around the following statement: \\"If we don't assign value ourselves, the markets will.\\" This begs two questions, (1) With what criteria do we presume to assign value apart from market forces? and (2) Which side is better at it, us or the markets? The answers are not easy and constantly debated.<br /><br />On rare occasions the author ventures into \\"Things were better in my day\\" territory, but for the most part he makes the compelling case that we're too quick to allow markets to value (and too often, devalue) our lives.
0767817478|1.0|i paid 1 cent for this i want that back. this movie sucked badd i bought this for my mother. she a godzilla fan since her childhood. when she seen this she threw this dvd on the side of the floor. i said i check it out. boy this is a jurassic park rip off. that is a lizzer not godzilla. this movie is STUPID!!!!!!!. im gonna trade this in for jersy shore season 5 dvd when it come out.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked the second book more than the first because I felt it had more of a story line then fifty shades of grey.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|The technology portrayed in the movie seems dated by today's standards, but it's still a classic.  Yul Brynner is great as the robot-gone-berserk bad guy.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!  I connected with the characters so much.... i just recently lost both of my parents (one 4 yrs ago and the other 2 months ago) So i was engrossed in the story!  I finished this book in one day... even through work!  I just also finished the sequel and boy did i cry!  Great great read!!!
B00845PV16|1.0|I loved the first Ghost Rider. And I was excited about the sequel, but it is just bad.  Beyond bad.  The story line isn't very good and is very predictable. The entire movie felt like it was just thrown together to cash in on the first. This move is a good example of why some sequels should never be made.
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed this series from begining to end. So lost as to what I read next. I would recommend this to friends, well more friends. It is for entertainment dont take it so seriously.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|This is a good movie and one of the few dramas I actually like. Yes, it has action to keep the pace up, but the action is secondary. To me this movie is a philosophical outlook on death and how people face it. Each character is forced to face the reality that we all die sometime and they have to decide whether they want to accept it, or try to live. The poem that Neeson's character recites is the main theme of this movie and I like it.<br /><br />The plane crashes killing most of the people and the survivors are hunted by a pack of wolves until they too die; though it is open to interpretation as to whether Liam Neeson's character dies. And for those of you complaining about the reality of the movie, maybe you forgot the fact that this is a movie. By the way, animals hunting humans isn't too far from the truth. It has happened before, though it is normally a single animal that does it and not a pack. But again, this is a movie.<br /><br />If you stay through the credits, you learn that the wolf he fights at the end is killed, but it's a real close up shot so you don't know if the character lived; or even makes it off the mountain. As for me, I feel that he character does ultimately die even after fighting the wolf because he lays all the wallets down and the letter. Sort of an acceptance of his end. But at least he went out with a bang.<br /><br />I recommend at least watching it once. Just be aware that the ending is open to interpretation.
B005NPLXJ4|2.0|I was very disappointed by this album.<br /><br />Though I liked some of the songs, like The View and Iced Hone, this album just don't sound good, no matter how many times you will listen to it.<br /><br />The greatest problem here is that the combination between Lou Reed and Metallica don't work. The consequence of that is that many of the songs sound boring.<br /><br />There is nothing memorable about it.<br /><br />2 out of 5

B008N1V11U|5.0|Incredible. I am absolutely blown away by the quality games being made for the android platform. This games graphics rival a large number of ps2 games. The combat system is fluid and very responsive. Yes people are going to say 6.99 is too high but this game demolishes a lot of 3ds games and those cost upwards of 35 dollars. Overall outstanding game and very worth the price.
1609611543|5.0|This book should be required reading in medical schools.  It seems pretty evident that today's genetically modified wheat is one of the major causes (along with sugar and too many carbohydrates) of the general ill health and inflammatory issues so many adults and children are dealing with in the US.  This book includes gluten sensitivity but is about so much more that wheat in general can do to our bodies.  It helps open up the mind to healing from within.  Prescription drugs treat symptoms but not the root causes of health issues.  I highly recommend this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun challenging and addicting! I highly recommend trying this app. You won't be disappointed. There is a good mix of easy and difficult boards.
0345525558|5.0|I read this book initially because of the pre-release buzz this book had created, and it does not disappoint.  This is an AMAZING book, one that draws you so deeply inside you want to finish it, yet you never want to finish it.  The main character is richly layered, the supporting cast is memorable and layered, too, and the writer creates a world with texture, feeling and the just the right amount of mystery.  What I want to know now is, what's next?  I'm most definitely a Vanessa Diffenbaugh fan!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I saw my son playing and it looked interesting so I tried it on my kindle. A lot of fun and addictive. Makes you concentrate and forget other things. Clears your mind for a few minutes. Much better than the other games I've tried.

0143036424|5.0|There's a new sheriff in town, and his name is Longmire. Walt Longmire. Walt has a cast of characters that both complement and challenge him, with Henry Standing Bear and Victoria Moretti receiving prominent attention. Small town life never sounded so good or so mystical. The scenes are painted to perfection by a man who certainly knows and appreciates his craft, the scenery of Wyoming, and the complicated relationships between two people that slowly develop over time. And that's the way this book reads.<br /><br />If you're looking for a mad race to the finish, with red herrings, carefully placed clues, and subplots galore, you'll probably want to skip over this read. But if you're looking for a mystery that ages like a fine wine, and only gets better as you move at a slow, steady pace toward the end, with characters so real that you can feel their breath whispering against your ear, you'll want to race to the bookstore and grab this mystery, if you haven't already done so.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this book.<br /><br />DO IT.<br /><br />I loved this book so much.  Everyone I have recommended it to since has loved it.  I can't understand why there are ANY bad reviews.<br /><br />Maybe you have to be a fan of dystopian literature?  I doubt that though.<br /><br />Just buy it already!<br /><br />Also, I hear they're making this into a movie... so read it before the movie comes out and you will be such a trendsetter!
0439023521|4.0|I had to read this to see what the hype was about.  For teens or tweens I can see why they love it.  As an adult reader I immediately caught on the nods to the the short story The Lottery, the TV show Survivor and the classic film Gladiator.  Most young people wont see the connection. Still the Hunger Games creates a dystopic world where the US has been divided into districts that produce food and resources for the Capitol.  Residents of the Capitol live a carefree life of ease while the distrcts face starvation and a yearly ritual where two young people from each district  are forced to fight to the death for the Capitol's amusement.  The young girl from District 12 proves to be a survivor and there is some puppy love thrown in.  Read it as it will keep the attention of young and old

0345803485|1.0|The human race is an amazing species capable of producing literature which truly encompasses the experience and complexities of humanity. As Shakespeare said, \\"What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an Angel! In apprehension how like a god...\\" This book, however, would cause the bard to undergo a ceaseless loop of dry heaving. This best-seller is less appealing then what comes out of the business end of a senior citizen with IBS after a trip to the all night Curry buffet.    I started the book with an open mind. After all, if millions of middle aged suburban women are raving about how hot the sex scenes are, it has to be true, right? However, before I even got to one of those yawn inducing fumble fests, I had to trudge through the inner workings of Anastasia Steele - a most lackluster and pathetically dull \\"protagonist.\\" For someone who is supposed to be this radically bright literature student, the harpy can barely knock two words together.    And then there is the legendary Christian Gray. SERIOUSLY?? Nothing about this schmo is either appealing or believable. The whole premise is that he is some sort of S&M sex god/philanthropist millionaire/damaged soul in need of saving. And who better for him to be \\"saved\\" by than a 21 year old virgin with no capacity for tying her own shoes?    I could overlook the author's clear disregard for grammar and the English language in general, if the book's promise of steamy hot electric sex was remotely fulfilled. However, these scenes read as if written by someone whose entire cannon of sexual experience was garnered with all the lights off and covers pulled up to her chin. Anyone who has ever had actual primal, hot, mind-blowing sex cannot read through this book without uttering an assortment of profanity. I wondered what kind of homely, frigid being would even bother trying to fabricate this stuff, and then I came upon the author's photo. Well - now it all makes sense. This woman is clearly in dire need of a good rogering. Perhaps Ms. E. L. James should have engaged in some actual field research with a human male before guessing blindly at what goes where and miseducating a demographic of equally unenlightened women.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great! It's very useful especially after you calibrate it. If you have doubts, just try it. It doesn't take up that much space and is very useful. Just try it!
0439023521|1.0|im really upset. i bought this book and i dident find any resipees in it. i was hungry and saw the name and figured it was a game that helped hungry peeple find food. im still hungry.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this was the first app I got on my kindle and I am already addicted to it you should get this app
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|Me and my husband did not even finish the movie... That's how bad it sucked.We will never watch it again. I wish I would know who rate that movie so high.....
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Honestly I've never heard of this band before. The only reason why I bought this was because it had some pretty good, heart pounding song samples but, after listening to the entire CD, song by song, Alter Bridge just became one of many bands that I really enjoy listening to. Two all time favorites of this CD are the frist track (Ties That Bind) and track eight (Blackbird) but, atleast the album keeps you more interested to get completely through the CD itself. I recommend this CD greatly to be added to someone's collection.
0307951529|3.0|It's definitely a motivational book.  It lacks any real practical advice.  In most cities/counties the cost of a business license itself these days is well over $100.  You do plan on running a legit business, right?

1476712042|5.0|Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />I don't even know what to say exactly. I feel like I'm in a weird roller coaster with this book. I loved Abby and Travis, I hated Abby and Travis, I wanted to hug them both, I wanted to kill them; I was just all over the place with them.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know what to make of this book. Obviously I loved it because I gave it five stars, but I have conflicting emotions about this book. Abby and Travis are one of those couples that are so wrong for each other that it makes them just right for each other. There was a lot of breaking up and I lot of misery and there was just a lot of laughs, and as one character put it, when their happy it's all peace and butterflies, but when their angry at each other they take the whole world down with them.<br /><br />I found myself laughing, at the edge of my seat hoping or the best. McGuire had my heart in my throat in one scene and she had me about to burst into tears in another. I started this book at 8pm and finishing up at 6am the next day. Once I was pulled in I wasn't able to pull out because this world just made no sense to me.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore feminist, I am of the opinion that no woman needs a man to survive they just think they do, and for a moment I was afraid Abby would become one of those women. She was so strong and had her head on straight in the beginning, but when she got entangle with Travis it was like all that went out the window. I don't think at all that someone will look at this book and say, \\"Hey, I need to have a relationship this twisted and confusing because it looks fun!\\" Honestly, Abby and Travis are just one of a kind. That's the best way to put it. Like another book I reviewed, these two somehow work for each other even when they want to kill each other.<br /><br />Now, this is where I would typically end, but I looked at other reviews that expressed how much they hate this book because of the \\"abuse\\" that goes on. And that's fine, not every book is liked (even Harry Potter has some haters) but I just want to point out to people that throw that word around just exactly what it is. Everyone knows that abuse has four different forms and each with a distinct definition:<br /><br />(NOTE: These definitions are obviously my paraphrasing but I think by this point we all know what they mean when we see them. If not, Google is everyone's best friend). AND: There are some minor spoilers, but hopefully not too much.<br /><br />Sexual Abuse: Also known as rape, improper touching, unwanted sexual attention, and making inappropriate sexual comments that make someone else feel uncomfortable. Does sexual abuse happen in this book? Absolutely not. Abby gives consent each time they are having sex, including when they weren't even together! Does he touch her in ways she doesn't want? Again, no.<br /><br />Physical Abuse: We know this has hitting, pinching, leaving some physical mark on someone. Does Travis ever hit her? No. He even says himself he would never hit a girl. Now, there was a scene when he hit a guy and the guy fell taking Abby with him, but that punch was never meant for Abby and Travis didn't even know what he was doing when he hit the guy. The guy was touching her and he went like a raging bull. But he realized his error and did his best to make amends.<br /><br />Verbal Abuse: Insulting or name calling. Putting someone down with words. Does Travis ever put Abby down or call her names? No. Not once, even when they were just friends or having one of their arguments.<br /><br />Emotional Abuse: Also known as Psychological abuse. When someone is causing another character psychological trauma, such as anxiety, depression, or stress. Now, an argument can be made that Travis does cause have some emotional baggage that makes Abby feel completely out of her element. She does experience stressed and in someways she is depressed. BUT she is also doing the same thing to him. He feels just as much emotional turmoil as she does whenthey are apart. Its not like its his intention to make her suffer emotionally, or she him. It just happens because of the way things are happening between them.<br /><br />And now, there is also the topic of stalking. First, he never crawls into her window to watch her sleep. But, when they are in bed together he does. I would like to know of one lover that has never done that to another lover. That's not called stalking, that's called appreciating what you have next to you. Almost every lover does it at one point or another.<br /><br />Also, he is not following her around campus. If you wanted to talk to someone really badly who was avoiding you, I think just waiting for them to show up doesn't constitute stalking.<br /><br />So, not everyone is going to like this book. I'm not even sure if I like it or not, but I do know that when two people have been through what they've been through I think that says a lot about where their relationship is going. I for one found myself enjoying this book just as much as I was having issues with it. Its what you make it and that's that.they are apart.

B000A2H9BQ|5.0|John Martyn's \\"Bless The Weather\\" has long been considered a breakthrough in folk, jazz rock, punctuated by honest lyrics, Martyn's flawless sense of improvisational guitar playing with the addition of legendary Danny Thomas' bass playing. This album also hints at the beginnings of Martyn exploring new guitar techniques unheard of by a folk singer/songwriter on \\"Glistening Glyndebourne,\\" through the use of a delay unit called an \\"Echchoplex.\\"<br />On this digital remastered, not only do the original songs speak for themselves. Martyn's vocals as well has technique in shaping melodies and chord progressions leave little to the imagination thanks to some fine audio engineering<br />This edition features a song later released on his equally brilliant Solid Air (an album devoted to label mate Nick Drake) \\"May You Never.\\" A band rendition featuring the late Paul Kossoff on guitar.<br />Having seen John Martyn back in the day (Solid Air tour), this album captures his brilliance and is a great introduction to a fine body of work.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've had the Panasonic Avatar release in 3D for my Panasonic 3D set up, and it is THE must own 3D movie.  It is simply stunning. I'm fully aware this is not the same release! I'm sure WHEN THIS IS RELEASED IT WILL EXCEED the Panasonic version for extra content (there is none on the Panasonic release), but the movie will still be the same quality. I was putting this here to be helpful for those who might not have ever seen Avatar in 3D on a home set for their pre-order. The render quality exceeds all other 3D movies to date, hands down.  It will make you want to own a 3D set up.  I show it to all of my friends and family and they are stunned. Awesome!! Can't wait for this release.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love it. It is so relaxing and I can actually fall into a deep sleep. There are many sounds but I prefer the water sounds. I hope people who get this app, have a very relaxing sleep.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|Call me a cynic but over the years when I see a movie being made based on a book I like I expect the movie to be bad or at best mediocre. So it was with a sense of dread that I began to watch the Disney movie \\"John Carter\\" based on Edgar Rice Burrough's \\"A Princess of Mars.\\" I guess you could say I was not too unhappy about the results even though quite a few things were changed in the movie and some of the major characters in the book were either removed or made into minor characters. \\"John Carter\\" doesn't reach the level of \\"Bladerunner\\" the movie based on Philip K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" but it doesn't fall to the depths of the 1984 \\"Dune\\" movie. Also I noticed that they wrote young Edgar in the movie just as a young Rudyard Kipling was written into \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" movie and it gave it a more human face to what was a huge budget CGI movie and I kinda liked that so I give it three stars because it's OK and if I could I'd give it three and a half because I sorta like it. I would hope that those people who saw the movie but haven't read ERB's books would take the time to read one. They are still good reads after almost a century in print.
